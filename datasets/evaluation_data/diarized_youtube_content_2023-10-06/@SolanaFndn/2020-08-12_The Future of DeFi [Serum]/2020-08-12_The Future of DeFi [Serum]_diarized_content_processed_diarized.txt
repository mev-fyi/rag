00:00:02.200 - 00:00:05.474, Speaker A: Hello. Hey, guys.
00:00:06.174 - 00:00:07.006, Speaker B: Hey.
00:00:07.190 - 00:00:08.594, Speaker A: All right. Are we live?
00:00:10.254 - 00:00:11.394, Speaker C: Yes, we are.
00:00:12.574 - 00:00:40.274, Speaker A: All right, cool. Well, I thanks everyone for coming. Excited to be talking to you all, and thanks to everyone who's listening here. It's not that much of an agenda. I mean, I've got a bunch of shit we can talk about, but mostly want to talk about what you guys want to talk about, too. And, you know, when it comes to serum or defi or, you know, whoever's really pissing the hell out of you today. So I.
00:00:40.274 - 00:01:37.614, Speaker A: Maybe I'll just start with a little bit of a serum plug, and then we can move on to less cringy stuff, which is, you know, the serum token SRM is listing today. It's listing in, you know, about 12 hours. Just going to be super hectic and exciting and hopefully a pretty good experience. So it's coming to an exchange near you, FTX, Bitmax, balancer, uniswap, and likely a bunch of others as well, which will, I mean, who knows? Last minute calls on their part. But I obviously would love to have everyone involved in that today. And then the other thing is that the sort of first pieces of the actual serum product, the ecosystem are going to be rolling out over the course of the month, which I'm really excited about. And maybe Anatoly and I can start getting a little more sleep at some point, once that's there.
00:01:37.614 - 00:02:09.196, Speaker A: And sort of all the people working to do more important stuff than us who aren't on this call, but I'm super excited for that. I mean, it's sort of, like, almost done and also a lot left to do in the way that many things are where it's like everything's done except hooking up to a Gui. And that last step takes, like, somewhere between a day and three weeks. So. But, you know, anyway, they, you know, gonna have some stuff coming out pretty soon, which is exciting. So I. Anyway, that preamble done.
00:02:09.196 - 00:02:11.944, Speaker A: People don't just go around and say a little bit about yourselves.
00:02:17.064 - 00:02:18.224, Speaker D: Happy to go first.
00:02:18.384 - 00:02:19.336, Speaker A: Go for it.
00:02:19.480 - 00:02:24.684, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. Clement here from Genesis block. We want a bitcoin center in Hong Kong. Do ATM and trading.
00:02:26.664 - 00:02:31.364, Speaker E: Hey, this is Anatoly. I'm co founder and CEO of Solana.
00:02:32.944 - 00:02:48.404, Speaker B: Hey, I'm Kevin. I don't know if we're in clockwise or what, but I'm Calvin. I'm the strategy lead at Compound. Basically work on everything business related for the past three years.
00:02:49.584 - 00:02:50.008, Speaker A: Nice.
00:02:50.056 - 00:03:03.244, Speaker D: I think we have different layouts. Dan, partner at CMS. We're a principal trading shop mostly sort of sprinkled throughout North America.
00:03:05.284 - 00:03:11.864, Speaker F: Hi, everyone, I'm Kyle Simoni. I'm a co founder and managing partner at Multicoin, and we're pretty large investors in Serum and Solana.
00:03:12.724 - 00:03:37.082, Speaker A: Cool. And I'm Sam Bankman Fried. I'm the CEO of Alameda Research and FTX. And Serum doesn't really have titles, but, you know, guy managing serum. So, yeah, this is super excited to have y'all on. These are some of my favorite people in the space and in the world. It's not a coincidence.
00:03:37.082 - 00:03:52.734, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't know, maybe just to start off with, like, interested in sort of your guys's takes, just on the defi space, you know, in general and specifically over the last few months. And what you see is like, you know, kind of the best and worst parts of it.
00:03:59.374 - 00:04:36.144, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll go first. I got you. All right, so we don't. We don't do a ton in the, like, farming side of it all with like, the sort of lending and borrowing aspect of it. Though we do touch upon it at certain pieces, we tend to still face most of the bilateral desks for the majority of our balance sheet moving and sort of borrowing. The thing we do face a lot on is the dexs and specifically these, like, amms, which have become very liquid and sort of relevant in a lot of the assets, especially new assets. It's because you can do it so quickly and so ubiquitously.
00:04:36.144 - 00:05:02.960, Speaker D: We're seeing like, that's just where the action is immediately and stuff that's like sort of getting out there in the ecosystem. And in general, the experience is pretty bad. We use it because we have to. The big issues are even beyond fees, which are high, that's acceptable. You can deal with that knowing, going into it. It's more like you don't know the pricing that you're paying ahead of time, all the time. And I know that there's some variations now, things that let you fix this better.
00:05:02.960 - 00:05:28.604, Speaker D: But in general, we've had a really hard time knowing what the mechanics of the trade are until post settlement, which is pretty terrible. It hasn't dinged us yet, but I'm very concerned. One day I'm just going to nuke and order into there and like, have 60% slippage and not entirely understand what happened. So, like, that's. That's bad from a UI perspective, it's like bad from a user experience. It's like super confusing. And then the second aspect is definitely like the speed.
00:05:28.604 - 00:05:57.094, Speaker D: Like, I've been sitting there just like waiting for metamask. At times to, like, do something. I'll punch the same transaction four times by accident because I'm like, not sure if it's canceled. So I would say that it leaves a lot wanting still for the whole space. And it's just impossible to use this if you're like a new person moving into the industry. Like, the hurdle to get to that point, to even be like, punching those things is way too much. So, like, there's got to be a better way of interfacing a lot of this stuff to people too.
00:06:01.034 - 00:06:46.140, Speaker F: My meta comments of Devi is like, you can see the future. Like, you go to curve, you go to uniswap, you go to one inch, you go to compound, you go to aave, like, and it's just like, there's no ach transfers and like three day movements and all that shit. And you're like, wait a minute, like, this is what money should be. And like, that's now, like, very apparent in a way that probably wasn't like as clear twelve months ago, but then, like, you just mechanically run into, like, all the issues that, like Dan, Dan just mentioned. And like, I think that's like a real big problem. And like, this problem is like, for every 1% growth in usage, like, it's very possible that transaction fees and like net settlement times increase two to 20 x. Like, it's probably a super linear curve because the bigger users are like more.
00:06:46.140 - 00:06:56.784, Speaker F: Less feet or less fee sensitive. And so the smaller users get, like hammered, like, way harder in terms of user experience. And so, like, that's like the real challenge I think Defi faces right now.
00:06:58.324 - 00:07:35.854, Speaker B: I've got like, two perspectives I've been trying to kind of reconcile for the past really few months. One is really the compound perspective, which is like, we've been around for three years. We've constantly been building with like, this long term focus. And when we launched comp and decentralized governance of the protocol kind of kicked off this little bull run in DeFi. It's getting to be a bigger and bigger bull run. And from a compound perspective, the way we think about the protocol is still, what do we. The protocol is not designed to peak this year or next year.
00:07:35.854 - 00:08:37.364, Speaker B: We hope the thing lasts for 20 years, 50 years, and is really infrastructure crypto for a long time. But then as an investor, like, right now, I'm like, fomoing to every single defi opportunity, trying every single product, doing all the liquidity farming. The money is made in these bull markets that come around every three or four years that only lasts six to twelve months. So those are two totally different mentalities. What I can say is, from a project building perspective, you know, what happened in 2013, happened in 2017, is all this money flooded in and sort of funded the research for the next three or four years, such that the utility of blockchains through each one of these bubbles increases exponentially. Like what you're seeing now, like Kyle said, with curve, uniswap balancer, compound aave is still just the framework of, like, really sophisticated financial systems. And I bet in three to four years it'll be like 100 times better and there'll be yet another bull run that looks totally different.
00:08:37.364 - 00:08:55.974, Speaker B: But reconciling those two views over the past few months has been kind of interesting. The long term versus short term opportunism. A lot of what is happening in Defi today, I think you could think of a sort of short term opportunism. Some of the projects that are launching, some of the ways users are being acquired.
00:08:59.114 - 00:09:30.320, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with what you're saying, Kevin. And for us, what we're seeing is most of the crypto people that been. I mean, I used ether delta back then, so I think with using all these other platforms now, I think it's a lot better already. However, my only complaint is the fees are just extremely expensive. Just trying to do like a $1000 trade. I could be paying, you know, $50 right now. Yesterday, I think the fees were, the gas fees were gone up to like 250 kw, which makes no sense.
00:09:30.320 - 00:10:10.080, Speaker C: I was teaching my cousin how to use it, and every time he was trying to buy something, he had to pay like ten or $15, otherwise it won't go through. And, you know, I've just given up on using high gas price on metamask, I just go to advanced and click like 150 just so the trade goes through. But I think it's still quite. I mean, compound has a really easy. That's how I came back into this, like Dex trading. I mean, you do a future. I was trying to do a few trades on binance Dex, which using trust wallet is pretty easy, and I think people can manage.
00:10:10.080 - 00:10:42.734, Speaker C: Compound also makes it very easy to manage. But then, you know, I think people that got in stablecoin, or when I've explained to them this whole yield farming, they look at curve and they're like, well, what is this? Do I want to trust this with $50,000 or not? So I think I'm super excited with what Sam and his team is going to be launching. And hopefully that would be a way easier, better user interface for people to do their defi stuff, you know?
00:10:43.874 - 00:11:10.414, Speaker D: Yeah. I think an important point to make is, right. Like, I didn't want to, like, pour cold water on all this. Like, it's really almost like telling. There's tons of people pushing through, like, the gates to try to use this stuff, right. It has so much usage that it's like, ramming up all of the, like, offsetting things that, like, sort of check the system that make it more expensive and sort of try to gate it. But that's just telling of, like, how many people want to use it, right? Like, there's, like, value here, there's, like, clearly a need.
00:11:10.414 - 00:11:12.118, Speaker D: Like, there's a market there.
00:11:12.246 - 00:11:12.862, Speaker A: It's just.
00:11:12.958 - 00:11:31.474, Speaker D: It got way too big too quickly and, like, the system's, like, clearly not stress tested to, like, get to that point that fast. So I don't know, it's. It's a good thing that all of the sort of problems are happening and people are still continuing to try to get into it. I think that's like, the big overall market theme. You got to glare, like, from it.
00:11:32.074 - 00:12:02.234, Speaker E: Yeah. To add to what Daniel said, I'm like, it's awesome that we actually have products that are live and this is what's driving the bull market because, like, if you step a little bit off the green path and matter mask or any of these things, you get lost pretty quickly. Right. And stuff is, like, frustrating, but people are rushing in to try all this stuff right now, and that's fine that it's not yet fully developed. We at least know that there is product market fit. And that, to me, is like, the really awesome thing about the space right now.
00:12:02.574 - 00:13:07.634, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree with a lot of what you're saying. I had, like, I think that the thing that made me excited about Defi and it sort of came through my, my, one of my, my tweet storms, my first compound, I was just super fucking kind of excited about it was just watching the on chain governance and c tokens, but especially the on chain government saying. I just sort of saw it. I was like, holy fuck, that works. It wasn't that, like, if you'd asked me if you're like, no, that's impossible, I would have said like, oh, can you do that? I guess you could, but it seems like you shouldn't be able to, but no, you can. And it's like, you know, the fact that you can, like, you know, use smart contract based tokens to, you know, send votes via smart contract on a proposal made by a smart contract from someone to modify a smart contract that controls smart contracts, that controls a protocol a lot of people are using with a description generated by the smart contract. It's sort of like you take this incredibly messy thing, which is like generating a proposal for how to make arbitrary modifications to a financial ecosystem and then voting on it, and you literally put it all on chain, and it's sort of like, oh, wow.
00:13:07.634 - 00:13:22.600, Speaker A: Theoretically, this actually just works. And if you build a nice gui on it, it actually works fine. And that's, like, sort of. Sort of made me feel like, oh, wow. Like, just do everything on chains. Like. Like, this defi actually kind of work in theory.
00:13:22.600 - 00:13:43.920, Speaker A: I think that's, like, one of my revelations. And I think the answer is yes, in theory, it does. Not for everything, obviously, but. But at least for a bunch of shit. And then I think the other thing was just, like, struggling for, like, two weeks to try and build projects on Ethereum. And, like, every time, like, sir does, would come back to be like, all right, Sam, bad news. Got to scrap this idea.
00:13:43.920 - 00:14:11.906, Speaker A: Like, it turns out it'll take three minutes to match each order. And that happening for a few weeks. And then having a call with Kyle and Anatoly about Solana, and I sort of came in knowing. It's like a fast blockchain. Yeah, I've talked to 30 fast blockchains in the past week. That's what everyone is. But then she's sort of, like, hearing them talking about it and feeling like, oh, this is actually a pretty different conversation from the other fast blockchain conversations we had.
00:14:11.906 - 00:14:44.134, Speaker A: Like, it sort of like, you know, the random numbers thrown out were backed up by, like, really compelling proof that those were the right numbers. And also, like, the numbers were bigger than the other big numbers and also were true. And. And sort of, like, the vision was, like, kind of practical and, like, yeah. Remember them asking me questions which were, like, good questions to ask? You know, like, what would it take to get these types of trading volume on a dex? What sort of speed matters? Which is sort of like, oh, wow. Like, no other fast blockchain asked that question. They're just like, obviously, we're the best for everything.
00:14:44.134 - 00:14:59.574, Speaker A: And so I think that was sort of, like, the second point, and we weren't seriously considering building on another chain going into that call and sort of going out of that call. We, like, had an internal meeting, and we're like, okay, like, does this change things? This might change things, right?
00:15:01.954 - 00:15:56.634, Speaker E: I had, like, kind of similar, like, realization that, like, I've been like trying to find somebody that understands that, like a layer one is if you do it right, it's perfect for a decentralized exchange, but you can actually do price discovery in this thing. You can make it programmable and open, and then you have something magical, right? Like we could like have effectively an open, globally available, permissionless version of binance that anybody can do anything in and like interact with all the state. And that was like, you're like one of the first people that was like, oh, yeah, this is like totally, like, yeah, so I am like, I thought this was going to take like five years for this, like, idea to, like, propagate from just a crazy dream to like, you know, the rest of the world. So I couldn't be more excited, like, to, like, especially building this in like, basically two weeks.
00:15:56.794 - 00:16:20.862, Speaker A: Yeah, uh, and we're pretty excited to. And I do think, like, people often ask us, why do you use Solana? And, like, one of the reasons is like, it's super fucking fast and that, that's a big part of it. But, but like, we like working with you guys. That's just like, unbelievably important. Like, anyone who's tried working with the team, they don't like, like, you just want to kill yourself after like a week. And like, after two weeks, the project's just dead and no one even knows why because the idea is there's sort of no reason. The answer is like, you just didn't get along.
00:16:20.862 - 00:16:32.132, Speaker A: And just like, every single thing was twelve times as hard as it was supposed to be. And so just like, yeah, being able to work well together is just worth so much. Yeah.
00:16:32.148 - 00:17:22.286, Speaker F: I mean, one thing that's become clear is like, ethereum is constrained in terms of throughput and latency, right? And a lot of like, the success of unis, like, you look at the history of Dexs, Ether Delta was a central limit order book, and then, like, and it was a lot of problems. And the zero X team came out and they were like, hey, you know, like off chain matching, on chain settlement, and it was an improvement. But like Phil, it kind of struggled a little bit. And like, there weren't that many market makers that were interested in doing this for multi minute settlements and all those things. And like, it seemed like Dexs weren't working through most of 18 and then, you know, Hayden, like, through uniswap on there. And like, it was just, it was simple, it was clever, and it like, helped the Dex kind of thing get going in meaningful way. The funny thing is, like, mark automated market makers have, like, been well known for a long time in economic theory.
00:17:22.286 - 00:17:59.554, Speaker F: And the reason no one ever built them was very obvious because, like, they don't, they're not good traders, like, and so we just had this simple thing that was clever that, like, worked within this very constrained environment. But, like, financial markets, like, it's well understood that, like, essential is, like, the correct way to do price discovery and trading. And so, like, in my mind, like, for the last year and a half, internally, we've been joking about, like, where is decentralized bit next? Like, we want to invest in decentralized bits. And, like, serum is really the first thing, I think, that fully encapsulates that. I think in order to do that, you have to have an order book because that's how you actually facilitate price discovery. Liquidity at scale.
00:18:00.294 - 00:18:20.014, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one thing worth noting is, like, a lot of people don't want to use an order book. They want to use, like, a market order or an amm type thing. I think it's, like, super important to have those interfaces, but also for those to work well and have liquidity to build off of, there needs to be an order book behind it that's like generating that sort of, like, pricing and liquidity and stuff.
00:18:20.794 - 00:18:42.900, Speaker D: Yeah, it's like two worlds, right? Like, you have people that are like, I have this, I want this, and they don't care about anything that's going on in the interim. And then you have an entire industry of people that are, like, in the business of, like, facilitating those two. And the problem is, like, the Dex is you just, like, you never could get the people that, like, needed to take liquidity. Like, it was too much of a hurdle. Right? Like, it was confusing. You were clicking like it didn't make sense. Like, stuff was like.
00:18:42.900 - 00:19:08.196, Speaker D: So that knocked it off. And then uniswap is too far in the other direction where it's like, you just, like, you don't really entirely even know what's going on all the time in the center. You're just, like, clicking and swapping. And that's really good for the pool of people that I don't want to say, like, unsophisticated, because I think that's a world war. It's like, people that just don't have either the bandwidth or, like, the cares to, like, go that far in for however much, like, sort of business they're doing in it. So it really caters that. And, like, you see that that blossomed really quickly.
00:19:08.196 - 00:19:29.404, Speaker D: And, I mean, obviously there's some like, mania that fed into it. But that's not a good solution for those people long term. They're just, like, sort of obfuscated from, like, what's going on in the background and sort of what they're paying. So I don't know, it's right. Like, I mean, you'll get to this world where, like, you'll have a UI that'll look like, effectively I have x, I get y, but then, like, the actual order book and stuff going on in the background that'll, like, make it work, right?
00:19:31.144 - 00:19:32.696, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm Sam.
00:19:32.720 - 00:19:38.762, Speaker F: I'm assuming serum is going to have, like, a, like, a simple view, right, where, like, it'll look like uniswap or one inch or whatever.
00:19:38.848 - 00:20:01.038, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I think, like, lots of exchanges are coming out with these. We are not the first ones to come up with it, although I think we did, like, a very slight improvement on a lot of people's versions of it. So now you can see kind of cool. Like, a lot of exchanges have, like, copied the phrasing that FTX used for. For sort of their, their version of this, although they had a different version of it before we had one. But, but, you know, it's sort of like market order or convert or whatever you want to call it.
00:20:01.038 - 00:20:20.184, Speaker A: This thing where the uniswap interface, we're just like, I have this, and I want this other thing. Here's the button to do that. And the nice thing is that you can have that buying or selling interface, but then on the back end, it can be plugging into a full order book so that you get good execution on it.
00:20:23.484 - 00:20:41.004, Speaker B: Do you think that you take part of the pie from competitive exchanges, including even your own centralized exchange, or you think it grows the pie and sort of invites in a new class of traders that aren't in crypto today?
00:20:41.424 - 00:21:16.864, Speaker A: I think that in the upside case, it does all of those really massively. And just to put that in perspective, like, three months ago, Dex global volume per day was under $10 million. And so the upside just kind of definitely, definitely, definitely isn't just trying to take what was the pre liquidity mining Dex volume like, that's not the grand prize here. The real goal serum is get a hell of a lot more than that. And some of that probably comes from centralized exchanges. Some of that is probably brand new volume. Some of that may come from other forms of trading, non crypto venues, some of that may come from OTC.
00:21:16.864 - 00:21:28.454, Speaker A: And a lot of that, the real goals, a lot of that is new volume is economically efficient trades that wanted to happen but couldn't because they wanted to happen on a Dex and didn't want to pay $5 to do a trade.
00:21:29.954 - 00:22:01.338, Speaker F: Yeah, I think one of the other things we're going to see that is really market expansionary is going to be bringing other asset classes into crypto payment rail or crypto trading rails. So, like, uniswap, we see this now. People make up a token, put it on uniswap, write some tweets about it, put up a website, and, like, say defi, and the price goes up. Right. You can do that 24 hours and, like, make that happen. And that's only possible because the whole thing is permissionless. So I expect, like, with the central and order book, you're going to be able to put that, like, on steroids.
00:22:01.338 - 00:22:30.564, Speaker F: And then I think what you're going to see is you're going to see people take external price feeds for other assets. So, like, it's going to be companies like, I don't know, Tesla or like Tencent or whatever, like flat high companies, and they're going to start creating synthetic contracts of various forms on something like theorem, whether it's in a perpetual contract or some other construction. But, like, you're going to start to see a lot of that, and then people are going to be able to have a single pool of collateral and they're going to be able to trade crypto and equities.
00:22:30.684 - 00:22:30.964, Speaker D: Right.
00:22:31.004 - 00:22:38.144, Speaker F: And, like, that's going to be like a wild, wild thing. That's going to be like the ultimate trading, trading playground for, like a whole classic trader.
00:22:38.684 - 00:22:50.120, Speaker D: Yeah, I think like also begs the question about, like, eating into, like, the centralized exchange. So, like, the world right now is stuff kind of like, is birthed into the world on like, the Dexs and sort of the uniswap.
00:22:50.152 - 00:22:50.272, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:50.288 - 00:23:29.794, Speaker D: Like that's, that's the lowest, like, barrier. Like, that's where stuff gets first. And then when it picks up sufficient liquidity and interest, unless it's like something that already had, like a ton beforehand and, like, clearly was just going to get listed, like, then the centralized exchanges go, all right, well, that thing's got some volume, we should list it. Like, that thing's getting picked up. Right, but there's a world where people don't need to migrate, right? Like, if that experience is good enough and you keep them there, it just stays there. And I think because it does have that lowest barrier entry, like, you'll be able to keep that pool of people there constantly instead of them bouncing off to the centralized exchanges because they're like, I can go do this over here now because I don't have to pay all the fees and deal with all the nonsense. But if they don't have that problem, they probably never leave at all.
00:23:30.534 - 00:23:58.294, Speaker E: Yeah. So the crazy thing with serum is that you can have a centralized, like, experience. And if that's where the initial liquidity starts, it's just gonna snowball there. Right. It doesn't matter if, like the second or third and fourth exchange list, if this is like where the first, the project goes live and it picks up steam, like that's where it's gonna stay. That's like a much more open, organic grown growth model. Right.
00:23:58.294 - 00:24:03.434, Speaker E: We kind of get a chance to redraw the map, so to speak.
00:24:08.234 - 00:25:26.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. And I think I would do a little bit of justice to the commenter RK, who's been sort of lightly needling us here and sort of try and give a little bit of an answer to, like, why the fuck do we think we can do this in sort of like a short period of time? And I don't know. I mean, honestly, a lot of my answer here is like, I don't know, like, you want to take a bet? You know, sort of like, we'll see where we are in a month. And I do think that that is like some of my answer, but maybe to give like a little bit of sense of why I think that other than that, sort of like c code getting written is that I think there are a lot of things that are like, really powerful and hard, but they're not hard in the, like, you need to develop general relativity hard, where you need to be like a singular genius taking decades and get extremely lucky. They're hard in the, like, there's a lot of intricate things you need to get right hard, but if you do a good job at it, you can do it. You just need to do a good job at it and sort of throw everything you have at it. And I think that's really reflected on sort of like, my experiences of what has gone well and poorly.
00:25:26.146 - 00:25:55.234, Speaker A: And I think you've seen FTX launch some products that didn't go so well. They aren't atrocious, they just never got that much steam. And often the answer is, I don't know. We three quarters asked it and it didn't solve a lot of the hard problems with it. And it's just an okay but not great trading experience. And then they just sort of sit there and then I think you look at the products that really fucking take off. And I think it's like, no, we ground through it and really got to the bottom of what's the right way to do this.
00:25:55.234 - 00:26:40.610, Speaker A: And I think, like, FTX exchange is also an example of that where it's sort of like, that's a, you know, I mean, it was a pretty quickly built product, all things considered, going to launch. And I think here, this is like a little bit of that on steroids. I mean, it's sort of like, been a really massive effort. Like, you know, what's sort of like making this better? Well, first of all, just choosing a fast blockchain and choosing a really fast blockchain and the right fast blockchain is worth like a fair bit. And that's something that very few people seem to be doing. And I think it actually takes a lot of work to figure out what the right place to build this on is. We had 30 calls before we got to one that helped really answer this.
00:26:40.610 - 00:27:15.764, Speaker A: And you need to keep grinding and really grilling people on it. Another thing is thinking about how it's going to plug into the rest of the ecosystem. That's a really hard thing. And you see a lot of good products built and just flop because no one ever uses them. That's another thing. How'd you get liquidity? So many exchanges have just been born and died because they never got liquidity through some market making partnerships. This is an unfair advantage that serum is going to have that it's going to be liquid from day one.
00:27:15.764 - 00:27:36.856, Speaker A: And so that's sort of like another big advantage that has going for it. We've built matching engines before. We've built a lot of this stuff. We've been through that wringer. And so that's going to help a lot. Just not having to make the same pitfalls again and again. And then there's just a ton of people working on this.
00:27:36.856 - 00:28:26.018, Speaker A: I mean, it's sort of like, obviously, people that I've been working with for a while have been helping to build it out, but the whole Solana team's been working to build this out. Everything from. From building out the ecosystem to rolling out modules that are helpful to answering a ton of questions. There's seven different wallet companies right now. Quickly building out support for SBL tokens, gotten a ton of support from exchanges and a ton of support from the community. The number of people working to build out their nodes before nodes even exist is really flattering and I think really, really exciting for CRM because it means that there's going to be actually a lot of people working hard to make it, you know, go as well as it can. And, you know, have really gotten a ton of support from a lot of the people on this call too, which has been, like, really valuable.
00:28:26.018 - 00:28:50.086, Speaker A: I think you kind of throw everything like that at it. You solve a lot of the problems that sort of a lot of exchanges, indexes and protocols have when they launch. And then I'll say like, one last thing, which I think optimistic roles are super cool and really powerful. They're not easy. They're not really not easy to get right, especially if you want to go bi directional from like a slow chain to a fast chain. Like, there's a lot of shit that goes into it. It's really hard to get it right, but you can do it.
00:28:50.086 - 00:29:24.554, Speaker A: Like, it's sort of like the pseudo code exists and it's just grinding away at it. And but if you get there, it creates this, like fully on chain, you know, fully trustless cross border protocol that is fast and efficient and cheap and that's like, you know, really powerful as well for, for sort of cross chain transactions. So throwing all that together and really just sort of like going all out on each part of this is sort of like my best attempt at answering, like, why I'm sort of bullish, more bullish on cirm than like generic Dex that launches and says it's going to be the next big thing.
00:29:27.574 - 00:30:25.420, Speaker F: One thing from this angle, you know, we've been hearing people in bitcoin and ethereum communities talking about L2 since what, 2014 or so? I think the first L2s went live in the last call, 9120 days with some zk roll up things that thus far have usage rounds to zero effectively. There's supposedly more L2 things coming out in the near future, but like, the L2 stuff is actually like all fragmented and like going in different directions. And Solana, like today, it's just like a single thing and it works and it scales. And so a big part of the challenge for scaling these things before has been that it wasn't possible and it is now. I think the other big thing is just like looking at the tool chain that's available. You know, Ethereum launched in 2015, there literally was no EVM tool chain. And like, Solana is built natively in rust and flagship language is rust, and Rust is like by far like the most robust and actively developed, like, developer community now across any major set of programming languages.
00:30:25.420 - 00:31:01.704, Speaker F: And Solana doesn't inherit a huge percentage of that kind of organically the theory I've never inherited. And so that just like a very asymmetric advantage. Oh, and then the last thing is just like the growth of like, wallets and key management systems like Taurus and portis and formatic and all these other things like, has just made it so much easier to, like onboard a new blockchain. And so, like, one thing we've been saying internally is we expect the new chains that are like, designed well to, to improve their ecosystem efficiency. At probably ten x the pace that Ethereum did. I think Solana is going to be like the first high profile case of that.
00:31:06.084 - 00:31:42.320, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, we got lucky by not being first. Right. We kind of get to benefit from all the experience of everyone else in the space. And like Kyle said, like using a language that is people at, you know, all the fangs, Facebook, Apple, they actually know that language, right? So, like, we have a much larger pool of developers, engineers, and, like, basically anyone that's been coding in the last decade can jump in and start building stuff. And that's kind of a huge advantage and much lower entry to barrier. And, you know, we also got lucky with our particular set of tech that we wanted to build. Right.
00:31:42.320 - 00:32:33.854, Speaker E: We chose a problem where there's only one hard computer science problem instead of two or three. So once we solved that, like, everything else was just grinding and the engineering and that, that's like, you know, that's a job and we love, we love to do it, but, like, you can actually do it and get it done in a reasonable amount of time. And I think, like, you know, I think why serum is like an opportunity right now is because we are left with just those, like, problems that we need to grind through and it's just work and we rapidly can get it done. We have, like, all the tools and all the people to just kind of grind through all the. We're going to make some awkward product decisions, some weird UI choices, right. But, like, that stuff is fixable, right? Like all the, like, actual meat and bones is done. The rest is just like making it pretty and like making it good for the user.
00:32:33.854 - 00:32:40.414, Speaker E: So that part is just work, right. And that's fine. It's a good spot to be in.
00:32:41.144 - 00:33:18.534, Speaker A: Yeah. It's like echo something that, like one of our dev said upon, like looking through the, you know, kind of taking a deep dive and I said, look, there's a lot of good things and a lot of bad things, but the great news is that all the really hard, important things are great and all the bad things are the things that just like, you can roll out and fix. And so even though it's like, not a great product right now, in one month, it can be an amazing product because it's like, it's sort of the stuff that you can, you know, just snap up, like building a good gui for a wallet that that was sort of like, you know, the biggest remaining things and, and all the super hardship they'd done, you know, just a fantastic job of.
00:33:23.634 - 00:33:27.570, Speaker B: Have you said when you expect like a first set of products to roll out?
00:33:27.722 - 00:34:10.134, Speaker A: Yeah. So, um, I think that the thing I keep saying is the next few weeks, which I think is about accurate, and to give a sense of where that time scale comes from, we're sort of sitting here thinking, okay, is it going to be live by the end of this live stream? Probably not. Is it going to be live by the end of two weeks from now? Probably. That's a weirdly large number of orders of magnitude of variance. And what's going on there is basically everything is theoretically solved. It's just like when we try and hook up everything to each other, do we run into annoying things we need to work around and how many times does that happen? And each one delays it a day. So to give the answer, basically there is on testnet an exchange.
00:34:10.134 - 00:34:38.074, Speaker A: It just doesn't have any Gui's or wallets or anything like that hooked up to it, and it's grinding through all those connections and making sure that those work okay and then seeing whether we're stretching some part of the system we didn't think hard about. So it's, you know, sometime in the next couple of weeks, we're gonna have, it's not gonna be the entire white paper, obviously, but the goal is to have like a Dex that's fast that you can do a trade on. That's like the first product.
00:34:39.014 - 00:34:40.474, Speaker E: Yeah, integration.
00:34:41.294 - 00:34:42.038, Speaker A: What?
00:34:42.206 - 00:34:48.074, Speaker E: Yeah, integration is the fun part. Right. Like just everything that you half assed goes wrong.
00:34:48.894 - 00:34:50.514, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:34:51.854 - 00:34:58.746, Speaker B: Do you have a sense if you launch with like a pair that people are familiar with or like 100 pairs or two pairs?
00:34:58.770 - 00:35:11.954, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. Um, sort of. I mean, I. First of all, I, like, we want to launch with what people want us to launch with. Like, that's sort of the definition of what an exchange should have. Like what people want to trade. So, you know, if ever, like, you know, wi fi, that's all that matters.
00:35:11.954 - 00:35:57.984, Speaker A: Like, all right, sure. But, um, but, you know, I serve to give a real answer. The first and easiest thing we can do, just to get like MVP up is basically create SPL wrappers on the six most highest volume tokens and list them there and list them against stable coins. And so have bitcoin, ETH, sol serum, and then a few other things. Trading in stablecoins, that's sort of like the obvious product that's covering the gigantic basis and then sort of thinking way harder about listings once that MVP is up. So.
00:36:01.484 - 00:36:03.584, Speaker F: All right, what questions we got?
00:36:03.924 - 00:37:00.670, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a. Let me see. A lot of things about, do we have customers, traders lined up to trade on the decks? The answer is, in theory, yes, but it's really hard to gauge how much volume that's going to be. You have 300 people on Twitter saying they're going to do it as soon as it launches and you have no idea how much volume comes from that. Is that $2,000 or 20 million? You've got all these market managers. Yeah, we're super excited to get set up, but also they have a history of taking six months to get set up on anything and who knows what happens. And so I think it's really hard to predict what happens on week one, but I think what I would say and say is on by month six, we have a significant fraction of the crypto ecosystem that's expressed a lot of excitement to be part of it.
00:37:00.670 - 00:37:58.230, Speaker A: And so I think I'm super excited about the potential for it to get a huge amount of traction over a reasonable timeframe if, and this is a big if, if it's going well, you know, if the product turns out well and, and things like that. Um, so, uh, were there other chains that were close or Solana the only choice? Yes. And in fact, Solana wasn't even the first time that we made a choice. Like, sort of had gone through a few, a few, uh, relationships before, uh, getting here. And so basically, like, you know, it's, why do we settle there? You know, because it was sort of, like, better in most ways than most of the other things we thought about. But, like, maybe one thing too sort of interesting is like, we want something fast. So you start with bitcoin, then you go to ETH, which is how much faster is it? Like ten times faster or something like that.
00:37:58.230 - 00:38:37.812, Speaker A: I don't know. By faster, basically, like, if throughput it at max capacity, then you go on to serve this, like, 2018 generation of blockchains, which are like, things number like five through 15 on Coinmarketcap. And so you have, Eos is like an example of one of those which are a good 5200 times faster than Ethereum. And then you have Solana, which is, what, another factor of 100 faster than those. And that last factor of hundred is actually worth a lot. But we sort of like, yeah, we're sort of like in the middle for a while as well, before we got there. And there's a few other blockchains that have like, pretty exciting tech.
00:38:37.812 - 00:38:59.944, Speaker A: They weren't, you know, they weren't there, they weren't ready for it or they had various drawbacks. But, you know, we'll sort of like, obviously, you know, see where the world is in a while. But like, so as far as we can tell, you know, in the end, in the most important ways, Solana was just sort of, just sort of seemed like the best.
00:39:01.924 - 00:39:47.404, Speaker E: That's awesome. I mean, like, I love hearing you speak about that, but like, I think, like, why it's fast. Like, people often, like, overlook a very simple thing that we did, which is we focused on horizontally scaling the execution of the transactions, which means that, like, we can just throw hardware at it whenever there is like actual bottlenecks. These are problems that engineers can solve. We don't have to spend years of developing or in researching another solution to scale or L2 or anything like that. It's literally just get more cpu's to validators. And like, if we get product market fit with a decentralized exchange, the $100,000 cost of hardware is like basically insignificant.
00:39:47.404 - 00:40:06.844, Speaker E: Like to like double capacity. It's just never going to be like a factor that like anyone should ever consider to be a problem. And that's kind of like the fundamental difference about how we've been designing this thing is like, can we, can we turn money into scale? Right? Like that? That's like, if we can, then the problem solved.
00:40:08.864 - 00:40:58.234, Speaker F: One thing I've, you know, I spent a lot of time looking at all the layer ones, and I was surprised by Solana really is the only one that I'm aware of made this decision is to enable parallel transaction processing inside of a single shard for context on that. Like on Ethereum, when your transaction is being processed by the EVM, that transaction can theoretically call any other transaction and touch any other transaction in the system. So effectively, like, if you don't have two transactions writing at the same memory space at the same time, and if you don't know what the transaction is doing ahead of time, then every transaction can't be processed in parallel. They all go sequentially. Every transaction effectively has a global monopoly on time of the system to execute that transaction. Ethereum is capped by single threaded performance.
00:40:59.174 - 00:41:29.444, Speaker E: Yeah. Imagine you built a matching engine where every trade locks up the entire matching engine for every time. It's just absurd. There's no way that thing would work for, like, you know, anyone, right? And this stuff has been around since the, I would say, like, late seventies, like, where people started building, like, dBASE and, like, those old school databases. Like, this idea of isolating transactions and running stuff in parallel is, like, ancient.
00:41:31.104 - 00:41:32.964, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:41:34.104 - 00:41:34.844, Speaker F: So.
00:41:36.564 - 00:41:40.716, Speaker B: Had you been, like, ready for this? Were you waiting for, like, the right party to kind of.
00:41:40.780 - 00:42:08.434, Speaker E: Yeah, like, my. My pitch deck, like, how I met Kyle, too, was, like, in this, like, Dex forum that Jill Carson set up. And I was like, hey, we're going to decentralize Nasdaq. We're building for half a million TPS and a gigabit. And, like, people laughed at me, and Kyle was like, okay, let me talk to this guy. And that was, like, the start of the conversation. My pitch deck has this, like, blockchain built for NaSDAQ, kind of, like tagline.
00:42:08.434 - 00:42:55.664, Speaker E: It's pretty cringey. But, like, I always thought that, like, if you have this programmable state machine, it is by definition of an engine of price discovery. And it's a really weird one because you can, like, throw arbitrary contracts there. Arbitrary, like, programs. And then computing the state arbitrage is, like, an intractable problem. It's, like, impossible to figure out what actually is the lowest kind of point of price for anything. So it's like a really interesting, like, price discovery engine, but it is what it is, right? Like, if that state has value, and there's programs that are dynamic and people are going to read the state and figure out, how do I extract value? This thing, right? This is like, what traders do when they look at all the automatic market makers.
00:42:55.664 - 00:43:44.458, Speaker E: But I think that the really cool thing is, like, with a central limit order book, you have a sophisticated, like, curve that is decided by the risk algorithms that all of these market makers and traders can take. And they can take these positions that reflect a whole bunch of parameters, not just a single curve that they're placing bets on. And in that space, there's just so much more opportunity to leverage capital and reduce fees and improve cost for users and, like. Like, I think an opportunity to move real finance into this decentralized space. So this was my vision. Like, it's crazy. Like, but I found Sam, too, that had, like, shares the same idea.
00:43:44.458 - 00:43:46.854, Speaker E: So, like, that, to me, is, like, super exciting.
00:43:48.514 - 00:44:06.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, serum's been getting a lot of hype the last zero, three four months. Have you seen, like, have you been hearing more developers contacting you guys with their ideas? I mean, has this helped, like, Solana, like, as a big picture? So what do you see?
00:44:06.372 - 00:45:14.592, Speaker E: Like, yeah, overnight we. Yeah, overnight. Like, in terms of kind of, like, just general ecosystem stuff. Like Sam said, we, like, we focused 100% on the hard problem was, like, get this thing as fast as possible and get consensus to the lowest latency. And, like, if this is important, then developers will just fix all the other stuff, the wallets, all that stuff is things that people know how to build. And when this project kicked off, we had basically a dozen teams overnight to start building all the tooling and every kind of bridge solution from lowest technical risk with the most trust assumptions, to the, like, highest technical risk, which is a full smart, two way smart, contract based, like, client thing with the lowest trust assumptions where the consensus and censorship persistent guarantees are based on the fundamental liveness of both chains, right? So that, like, kind of just. We knew all those people in the space, right? We've been building for, we've been building for years, talking for years to these folks.
00:45:14.592 - 00:45:42.114, Speaker E: But, like, as soon as this catalyst happened, everybody just kind of joined in and jumped on. And there's a bunch of stuff that I think serum is listed and things that are in the pipeline that haven't been announced yet. But, like, every defi project is now has potentially an alternative to Ethereum. Right? Like it's, you know, Ethereum, defi, and the ecosystem and the community there right now is unbeatable. Like that. That is 100% true. Right? But there is.
00:45:42.114 - 00:45:50.846, Speaker E: If you want to do something different that you cannot possibly do on Ethereum, even in a L2, there's like an opportunity to do so.
00:45:50.870 - 00:45:51.434, Speaker A: No.
00:45:52.734 - 00:46:10.434, Speaker D: Have the direct asset issuers started reaching out like the stable coins and then probably some of the other sort of like, native assets that sit on top of Ethereum that, especially ones that are multi chain, because I guess that's got to be useful for you guys if you can get that in natively, especially in the context like serum, but even just like a larger scale.
00:46:11.554 - 00:47:43.064, Speaker E: So, like, this is the fundamental difference between a layer one and any kind of L2 solution, is that the rails to stable coins and exchanges cannot go directly into a L2, right? So you have this like a Dex, right, with execution and this local settlement that still has to do a settlement hop from that environment to the main chain and then transfer to, let's say, tether, right, to convert to fiat. You can't really scale finance that way. Right? Like, if you're talking about, like, big institutional money or like, not even, but like, big traders that have big balance sheets coming into the space, all those hops add additional risk. Like, if you're stuck in a, in, like, CK roll up with like two week kind of like challenge or whatever, like, if you're stuck in optimistic roll up, it takes two weeks that somebody could potentially challenge your withdrawal. Right? You have to take that into consideration for the risk of those assets and the price you're going to take inside that trading environment versus you're in a layer. One that has a direct layer to, like, let's say tether, right? You get, you do your trade, you convert to tether, you can burn it and get fiat instantly, right? That's the difference is that, like, there's like, basically that all those speed bumps are eliminated in the layer one. And having a central limit order book is like, I think the coolest thing because now we have risk and positions taken by large firms with large balance sheets.
00:47:43.064 - 00:48:14.944, Speaker E: You can literally use that as a real oracle. That gives you, the stuff that I want to build is automatic request for, quote, unchain where there's a central limit order book. I am doing some kind of crazy oracle thing. And when I need to, like, when I need to liquidate, I get a real quote. I'm not dealing with, like, a price feed. I can actually settle to this thing immediately. Like, all this stuff becomes possible where, like, all those risks that are present in DeFi right now because of these extra hops are eliminated.
00:48:14.944 - 00:48:53.154, Speaker E: Like, in my mind, this is as significant as, like, the settlement of bitcoin and the amount of security it guarantees is, I think what created this, like, liquidity monster. And if we have those same kind of guarantees of state and value and those numbers, like, where I'm not taking risk with some weird network that's mixing prices and manipulating them to get an edge. Like, if we can get those guarantees, I think this will have as much impact as the security of bitcoin. But I'm obviously, you know, I'm obviously very bullish, right?
00:48:53.494 - 00:48:54.142, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:48:54.278 - 00:49:14.754, Speaker E: I think this, like, when you think about the future, right? Like, you imagine science fiction finance, do you imagine, like, L2, or do you imagine one giant supercomputer that is open and permissionless? All this stuff happens in a single address space. Like, what do you think? Right? Like, what do you imagine? Right?
00:49:15.404 - 00:49:39.244, Speaker D: I just think that it trades, right? No, I get where you're coming from on that. So I guess, I mean, it has to be good, right? Like, I mean, like this has to be like a huge vote of confidence for you guys. That's got to like significantly advance the conversation. You, I mean you're probably having these conversations at many levels, but I'm sure it's kickstarting it to be a little more like, all right, let's get this done.
00:49:39.404 - 00:49:44.584, Speaker E: It's like napalm. Like it feels like everything is moving like at 100 times speed.
00:49:46.844 - 00:49:47.624, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:48.684 - 00:50:04.628, Speaker F: Sam, I got a question for you. So we use all the major centralized exchanges and I gotta say my favorite user interface, of course, any of them is ftxs. Just like the spacing, like the elements, you can drag and drop the components and all that stuff.
00:50:04.796 - 00:50:05.704, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:50:06.204 - 00:50:16.722, Speaker F: It's very well done. Are you guys gonna be bringing that front end or parts of that front end serum? Like can you hook up that front end to the new serum backend?
00:50:16.898 - 00:50:49.840, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's, I mean there's going to be some changes. And another thing I'll say is like, it's going to be open source. Anyone can do this, anyone can build their own Gui, anyone can add on to a GUI. Like this is not like this is the only way to access it. Like it's a blockchain that, that's open. But, but that being said, like, yeah, obviously we want to have a good GUI and we're going to bring a lot of the elements in at least like one sort of piece of code for GUI that we're going to be publishing and I think other people are as well. And one of the really nice things about how serum is designed is that it's sort of, in most ways you can just plug into it.
00:50:49.840 - 00:51:33.996, Speaker A: Like you can plug into a normal centralized exchange not quite like that. There's an extra step, but it's not massively harder. There's an API, there's an API interface where you can call send order of bitcoin, USDT, you know, 12,000 comma one or whatever. And so what that means that it's relatively easy for algorithmic traders to plug into. It also means it's relatively easy to stick a GUI on. You don't have to, like the GUI doesn't have to understand the blockchain. The GUI can just use the API effectively, which makes it a lot easier to sort of like port things like that over and create sophisticated GUI's on it.
00:51:33.996 - 00:52:11.134, Speaker A: And what's happening on the backend basically is like it's all open source. There's wrappers that take that API syntax and turn it into the relevant blockchain code and see call those, and then you send that to your Solana wallet and say, hey, please run this. And then that sends the blockchain. And that's what the flow looks like. Other than that, having to communicate with your wallet point of view. Instead of a centralized server, the server plugin is very much like a centralized exchange. You can just port over a lot of stuff without too much work, which is really nice.
00:52:14.074 - 00:52:24.822, Speaker D: Any world where you just access all of that via the FTX current UI. So it's not even two experiences, it's all just seamless. You just swap between the two.
00:52:24.978 - 00:53:07.638, Speaker A: Yeah. And in fact, like one thing that I will say is like, you know, one thing that you could imagine doing is FTX just listing like BTC, perp dash serum or something like that as a market on FTX, just through your FTX account and Gui. But that plugs into the serum market and there's no reason you can't do that. And I think like, you know, we're after see what makes sense, what there's demand for. But I, you know, there's, that's doable. You just have to think about like where the funds are stored and who has the keys there. So.
00:53:07.766 - 00:53:23.568, Speaker C: So am I right? Like theoretically someone can build a wallet and use your open source and just create a GuI, and all that person needs to do that could be a complete new person in the space down that wallet and it can also trade there.
00:53:23.696 - 00:53:24.384, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:53:24.424 - 00:53:25.408, Speaker C: All in one place.
00:53:25.576 - 00:53:52.064, Speaker A: Yep. There's no gatekeeper here. It's just, it's all on chain. And that's the cool thing about that. It's like serums can be 100% on chain. It's not like you got some on chain funds and you do your off chain magic and then some trades happen, like the matching engine's on chain, the order books on chain funds are on chain, everything is on chain. And so anyone can build a Gui or wallet plug into it and we're going to be open sourcing all the things that we built for it.
00:53:52.064 - 00:53:56.704, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:54:00.524 - 00:54:19.744, Speaker B: You know, like the business of like one inch is routing trades through multiple dexs or amms or whatever is there, how come centralized, how come quarter book exchanges can't route through multiple pairs, or at least they don't offer it as offering because it's not like deterministic, you're not guaranteed to fill.
00:54:19.864 - 00:54:25.284, Speaker A: There's a lot of things. So the question is, why isn't there something that plugs into a bunch of centralized exchanges together?
00:54:26.984 - 00:54:36.358, Speaker B: Or even like on GX, there's a BTC, the USDT pair. Maybe that's not a good example. Why can't I go like, one shitcoin to another shitcoin?
00:54:36.446 - 00:55:08.490, Speaker A: Right. So the answer is basically that you could build an incredibly sophisticated algorithm that made a lot of money doing that than your trading firm, or you could build sort of a pretty dumb, naive algorithm that will do that, and then all of your customers will be irate every day because it doesn't do exactly what they hoped it did. And it's sort of an unfortunate fact of the world. But it's really true. Building non deterministic financial software for customers is terrifying because they're always going to claim it didn't do what they hoped it did. And that puts you in a really shit spot. That's one of the big worries here.
00:55:08.490 - 00:55:36.026, Speaker A: And as you say, you whiff on an exchange customer why it whiffed. It shouldn't have whiffed. That's not a great user experience. I think that's one of the big problems. And the other big problem is at some point you ask, what's the value add here? If the customer has to separately go create an account at every exchange fund, every exchange separately, there's no cross collateral, no cross margin. Get their APIs collected, then submit it to central place. You've already made them go through a lot of the work.
00:55:36.026 - 00:55:50.894, Speaker A: That being said, there are some places that do a really sleek job of this. You see three commas and stacked and places like that. They actually do create cool shit for connecting between different exchanges. But it's actually quite a complex thing to do that in such a way that users are more happy than they are angry.
00:55:57.614 - 00:56:01.174, Speaker D: It kind of sounds like you're explaining the problem with Uniswap there when you're.
00:56:01.214 - 00:56:02.878, Speaker A: Like, oh, yeah, right.
00:56:02.926 - 00:56:04.406, Speaker D: Like it's kind of the same issue.
00:56:04.550 - 00:56:13.674, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, the uniswap, Oracle filled you at a price. I don't know what price. It's a price. We'll tell you later. Maybe there are some fees. You'll see.
00:56:13.674 - 00:56:42.980, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's pretty scary, and I think people put up with it because they have to sort of, but it really limits what DeFi can do. I mean, you know, you can't send a $2 million order because you don't want that sitting out there for five minutes. Can't send a $20 order because you're gonna be paying $5 that in fees. Can't please send orders in bitcoin because there's too much price discovery on short timescales. So you start left with $5,000 trades and chickpoints. That's the thing you can do on uniswap. And not surprisingly, that's what Uniswap has.
00:56:42.980 - 00:56:51.974, Speaker A: Like, that's what amms are great at. And that that's not most of what the volume is in the world, but it's. It's. It's most of the volume that they're accessing because it's what they're able to.
00:56:56.114 - 00:57:03.146, Speaker F: Let's look at these questions here. One of them talks about serum BTC and serum USD. Do you say much there, Sam?
00:57:03.330 - 00:57:37.512, Speaker A: Yeah. So basically, what are these? They're basically like, just like, suggestions for types of tokenized products that you can build on serum. And what they are in particular is ways. Ways to try and get dollars or bitcoins onto Solana. And it's generally hard to move dollars and bitcoins onto other chains because they're not currently on a smart contract chain once I've been on a blockchain. So you need to do, like, you need to make trade offs between centralization and utility there. And they're just meant to be, like, kind of suggestions of ways that might be, like, pareto improvements over some versions of it right now.
00:57:37.512 - 00:58:29.252, Speaker A: Ogd be pretty cool. And maybe the thing that sort of, like, ties them into serum is that they rely on a bunch of shit that you can't do on most places, like speed or intricate enough that they just wouldn't work on Ethereum. There's too many steps. It's too slow and expensive. Anything with price oracles, like on chain price oracles, you need natural Dutch with an order book to do that. So in a lot of ways, it's just like they are intensive enough to run that they can only run on a real order book. All right, do we have API docs released? We have API docs on a GitHub.
00:58:29.252 - 00:59:03.974, Speaker A: They're like 90% complete. If you're actually excited to build on them, shoot me a message. We can get you access to the repo now. Otherwise, in like two days, we're going to have it fully open to the public. We just want to remove the embarrassing comments and implement the last things before we sort of open up to too much scoring. So, yeah, I mean, I've. I don't know, I've.
00:59:03.974 - 00:59:37.174, Speaker A: I've had a lot of fun. I, you know, really thanks to everyone for, you know, for listening in, and big thanks to the five of you for coming here and also for helping us so much that I was excited to have you guys come here. You've really kind of each helped make, you know, serum happen. And that, that's true of a lot of other people too. And, and it's like super fucking grateful to all the support we've gotten. Anything, it's just like, yeah, we'd have like a third as much done if that, if it weren't for that. That's worth just worth a lot.
00:59:37.174 - 00:59:54.894, Speaker A: Again, shameless. Shell for the listing tonight. Whatever. Go projectsverm.com listing and take a look at that. But more importantly, the actual products can be launching in the next couple of weeks. And I'm really excited to have that go live and sort of let people experience it.
00:59:54.894 - 01:00:16.774, Speaker A: I unfortunately have to run now. I have a yet another listing call with one of the billion exchanges that are going to list it maybe sometime the next 20 years or maybe tomorrow, who knows? So I'm going to have to jump off, but yeah. Thanks so much to everyone.
01:00:17.594 - 01:00:18.074, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:00:18.154 - 01:00:18.578, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:00:18.666 - 01:00:19.494, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:00:20.214 - 01:00:27.774, Speaker A: Thank you guys. See it. Bye.
