00:00:02.240 - 00:00:40.042, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everyone, to the salon of community validator discussion, May 11, 2023. The agenda for today, we've got a lot of things to talk about. So first the validator updates. Then I'm going to give a minute for the new head of staking, Ben Hawkins, to talk about his role and just intro himself, if you haven't already met him or know of him. Ben Sunny is going to present the Solana balladair toolkit Sbt. So we're going to have some time for that. And at the end, Marinade will talk about their new directed staking product.
00:00:40.042 - 00:01:09.238, Speaker A: So lots of things to discuss. Let's jump in. First of all, Mainnet. So we have the call out for 10% of stake to move to 100 1417. Looks like the operators have met the call, so we've got about 10% of stake there. Next week, we're planning to ask for 25% of stake to move to 114 17. And then the following week, the plan.
00:01:09.238 - 00:02:17.974, Speaker A: Assuming all goes well with that plan, we will call for full adoption the week of May 22. So hopefully, if nothing changes between now and the 22nd, we'll have 114 17 be the majority version on Mainnet. So any, any questions about that rollout plan so far? I think at this point, everyone's seen the root cause analysis and has a pretty good idea of, you know, what's, what's going on and kind of the structure of the rollout plan. But any other thoughts or ideas there? Did you, is there any updates on the adversary testing? Is that moving along? Yeah. So there's a good amount of adversarial testing going on in private clusters. The reason for that was mainly because the 100 1417 and 113.7 fixes that address the root cause of the last restart were potential security risks for the cluster.
00:02:17.974 - 00:02:52.038, Speaker A: So I guess the answer is yes. We could probably do a better job of sort of putting that out there for. For stuff that's public. But at this time, I think most of the work has been kind of behind the scenes. I assume they're moving forward to testing things, as in how they will, I suppose. Yeah, yeah. There's also a channel in discord, I forget the exact name of it, if somebody remembers put in the chat, but there's a channel talking about load emulation of Mainnet on Testnet.
00:02:52.038 - 00:03:44.328, Speaker A: So that's sort of another area where engineers are putting more effort and there's more focus on how we can test in Testnet better. But, you know, another big part of that whole adversarial push and sort of like how we harden our release cycle is this process I'm talking about now is a more slow rollout of 114 and future releases. And also I'm sure a lot of, you know, the upgrade and downgrade cycle we went through on Testnet to make sure that we can both go forward and go back between the two minor versions without issue. Cool, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Okay, no questions then for Testnet. Nothing really changed between last call.
00:03:44.328 - 00:04:32.874, Speaker A: So 114 17 is still recommended on Testnet. The plan is once 114 17 is adopted on Mainnet, 116 will then be recommended for Testnet. 115 was the release that was cut, but it was abandoned after the 114 rollout didn't go successfully for the last restart. So 115 is gone. 116 will be the next release on Testnet. Quick plug here for validator educational workshops so the last workshop was a few weeks ago. Steve from Core Engineering did a great job talking about logs and what logs are important when your validator starts up.
00:04:32.874 - 00:04:57.944, Speaker A: So want to keep that cadence going on like a monthly basis. I think the next one is going to be May 31, 1700 UTC. And yeah, like always looking for topics and presenters that people are interested in or passionate about want to teach. Just as a quick plug here, if you haven't seen the workshops, there's a playlist on YouTube that I'll put in the chat.
00:05:02.284 - 00:05:03.224, Speaker B: There we go.
00:05:10.244 - 00:05:37.794, Speaker A: Cool. But yeah, if you have any thoughts or ideas, please reach out on discord, let me know. I'll remind people again that next community call. But as we get closer, I'd like to have a better idea of what the topic is and who's presenting. All right, now I want to kick it over to Ben Hawkins, the new head of staking at the Solana foundation, to intro himself.
00:05:39.094 - 00:06:33.934, Speaker C: Everybody, my name is Ben Hawkins. I know I've met a lot of you either in person over Zoom in these calls and just on discord in general. So now, and I used to run the code in crypto validator, so now Brian Cole runs that validator and I no longer kind of have access or control over that. And yeah, so slam foundation brought me on as the head of staking. And generally what that means for me and for the community is I'm going to be thinking about how can we change, you know, these, the foundation's delegation strategy in a way that can sort of have validators graduate out of it. Like, you know, the current system is kind of has filled its role for a long time. But I do would like to see a system where people can have foundation stake and have a path to being independent of the foundation.
00:06:33.934 - 00:07:28.084, Speaker C: And that's kind of just the goal in general, across the foundation is like, how can we move sort of the centralization and the components that the foundation does kind of like, into the hands of the community. And my goal is to do that in a smooth way that, you know, that maintains the health of the network, but also reduces the level of control and independence that the network itself has on the foundation. So, yeah, that's kind of like where my head is at. Anyone wants to kind of reach out to me, have thoughts, things that they want to see, you know, happy to hear feedback and. And share where my head's at a little bit without, you know, jumping the gun on kind of renouncing anything. So, you know, there'll be things I won't be able to share right away. But, yeah, I would love to hear from anybody who has an opinion on what they think about the delegation, delegation program and where they'd like to see it head to.
00:07:28.084 - 00:07:48.754, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I think the community is going to be a really important information source for me. I mean, I've been in this, in the shoes on the other side, but I don't. There's no way for me to have seen everything and know everything that's going on. So I'll be depending on this community of validators to help us think through what's a good way forward.
00:07:49.934 - 00:07:50.270, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:50.302 - 00:07:52.474, Speaker C: Appreciate it. I think that's it for me.
00:07:53.134 - 00:08:35.830, Speaker A: Thanks, Ben. Yeah, let me share again. So here's Ben's discord handle if you want to find him on discord. And let me put that in the chat as well. Great. Okay, so now I'm going to hand it over to Sunny. He's going to intro the smart validator toolkit, which I will let him take over presentation.
00:08:35.830 - 00:08:37.154, Speaker A: So go ahead, Sonny.
00:08:40.294 - 00:09:09.630, Speaker B: Thank you, team. Hi, everybody. I will ask my friend and partner Leo to share his screen because I just can't handle doing both. I'm not that good at multitasking. Okay. Seems to be working one point for us. Okay, so SVT is our community project for validator operators.
00:09:09.630 - 00:09:37.888, Speaker B: It's a toolkit for installing, monitoring, and managing your validator via web. Three includes alerting and financial reporting features. It's based on, on our SV manager project, which you may have heard about. It's currently used by some 200 Solana validators, which is much appreciated. Thank you, guys. So right now, we are in anonymous mode because we have not connected a wallet yet. This is how it looks.
00:09:37.888 - 00:10:26.044, Speaker B: This is a full list of validators. You can click any of those and without connecting your wallets you will see a number of metrics important to assess the performance of this validator, including the J score there at the bottom 40. For this validator the J score is by the way, the score we use to distribute stake in JPOL. So you can see it right away. If the validator has a monitoring module installed, we'll switch to another that does the SVT monitoring. There are additional, there's some additional information, some additional metrics at the bottom here. It is in the monitoring section which refer to the performance of the Linux node is installed on.
00:10:26.044 - 00:11:02.054, Speaker B: So you can see here, by the way, that this validator has a warning. It's on the top of the yellow warning and it is also marked there. The metric in question, which is troublesome is also marked with a yellow stripe. So right away you can see if it's your validator. You can see that there is something that needs your attention. It could also be read in that case that is really an error or a critical value of one of the metrics which requires attention right away. You can also be alerted about that, but later.
00:11:02.054 - 00:11:46.938, Speaker B: More on that later. Now let's connect a wallet. After you do, you are able to select nodes for your watchlist, so it's easier to navigate between them without looking for them in the full list every time. And also very important, the control and alerting features become available there in the menu on the left. So what else do we have here? In the menu we have the report section. Here you can see how your validator performs financially, your expenses, your gains. You can also enter the server costs, so you see like the true profit and loss.
00:11:46.938 - 00:12:03.954, Speaker B: And you can export this to a PDF and send this to your accountant because I'm absolutely sure that every single one of us is fiscally responsible and reporting all of your Solana income yearly. Right.
00:12:06.774 - 00:12:07.390, Speaker C: What else?
00:12:07.462 - 00:12:43.414, Speaker B: Alerting. Alerting is in the menu at the bottom here. For the delegators there is a delinquency or commission change notification. So if you are delegating yourself to a validator, you want to know when they go delinquent so you move your stake or if they raise their commission. And the other two switches are for validator operators. You can be notified only on critical level, some real errors, or you can be notified on everything, including warnings. Right now the only channel available is telegram.
00:12:43.414 - 00:13:42.454, Speaker B: You use this, you get a telegram channel where you get all the notifications. But we are working on adding a couple of other options as well. We have a public API here as well. You can use this to use our public API in your products comprehensive docs available. If there's anything ugly or if you want to get a key to use this, just reach out anytime to me or to Alex Frey blockchain Messenger let's move back please. Messenger so in order to create the communication layer between the web3 and the agent, the SVT agent running on your Linux node, we had to develop a communication protocol. And when we had that we used it as well to create the blockchain messenger feature which is secure on chain communication between wallets.
00:13:42.454 - 00:14:10.778, Speaker B: You can also use it say for delegator to validator or vice versa. Validator broadcasting to all of their delegators communication. We hope it will be used. Check it out, play with it. We appreciate any feedback. Now the control feature, which is probably the most important one. So if you're on the go, you don't have access to an SSH terminal, but you need to do something with your node.
00:14:10.778 - 00:14:43.322, Speaker B: This is where you go. Right now we are on Mainnet and Leo doesn't have a running validator on Mainnet which is why this is empty. But if you click settings, it walks you through the process of installing the agent on your validator. We have full comprehensive document with manual and screenshot and everything. So this is when our on testnet and there is a validator and the agent is installed. So this is what you see the interface and in that drop down list right there. Yeah, thank you.
00:14:43.322 - 00:15:27.246, Speaker B: You have the comments. Install validator which is for a fresh install. This is what you start with. You can restart the validator from here, you can stop it, update the software weekly, update the monitoring module, etcetera. This is what you do via web3. Right now on the roadmap we plan to do this via telegram as well and we are working on a mobile app to make it even more convenient when you need someone to do something on the go. Also on the roadmap we want to add the restart cluster command so we don't have to all sit around at 04:00 a.m.
00:15:27.246 - 00:16:07.582, Speaker B: Waiting for the cluster to restart. Installing plugins such as Bloxroute, which is coming up next. Installing jitter client if you want to and also on the roadmap, performance analytics to help you make your validator simply earn more. That is pretty much oh yeah, right. Postcryptome last but not least, if you are running SVT on your main net validator, you're automatically in JP. Thank you for your attention. Yeah, this is the diagram of the internal architecture of SVT.
00:16:07.582 - 00:16:19.034, Speaker B: For those who aren't interested. And we will gladly take questions. Now, probably Alex will take questions. You know I'm a talking head, but you know me. Guys.
00:16:21.014 - 00:16:25.074, Speaker A: Sunny, there was a question about the best way to reach you. What handles would be good?
00:16:26.634 - 00:16:31.074, Speaker B: Sure. I'll drop all of those here on the chat, our channel and.
