00:00:06.640 - 00:00:37.025, Speaker A: Thank you everyone. I'm Weid from Rome. We are located in Vancouver, Canada. So excited to roam into Singapore. Connect the great people here together in Breakpoint. What is Roam? Roam is a global roaming network. Essentially we are free to use telco because we are building and validating the network together.
00:00:37.025 - 00:01:13.669, Speaker A: When you talk about free telco, most of us think about public WI fi. Yeah, but public WI fi they are typically not encrypt. Whenever you go you have to redo the logging process. That is not Rome is offering. Rome is offering a secure, seamless, decentralized network. We're connecting 600 million public Wi Fi into a United one. We started launching our network last year in July.
00:01:13.669 - 00:01:56.737, Speaker A: Thanks for the Solana ecosystem to help. In the past year the network grew dramatically. These numbers, our last year, our last month's number. Right now we already have over 600,000 nodes in 200 countries. Our largest users is already nearly 800,000 users. That's amazing. So why it happens is everything coming from solving a small real world problem? With all the problem public WI fi has, the industry has something called open roaming essentially.
00:01:56.737 - 00:02:37.131, Speaker A: But the adoption of open roaming has a problem. That's why they need our deep in to help with roam. You create a DID and you have your open roaming profile. Quickly you can start enjoying the seamless Wi Fi and Web3World. How do we build and evaluate network together? You either provide your gateway access point or you validate networks. So we call checking process. Every day we have more than 400,000 public checking from you and me.
00:02:37.131 - 00:03:24.825, Speaker A: That's amazing because we do work together. That's why we can have this free telco for everyone to join. Some people call us a physical L1 because we bring network users to the blockchain. The typical journey is you provide a gateway, you collect incentive. But because the network provides you real world revenues from CDN VPN ads. So we together by receiving the incentive, the real revenues, we can return a free service to people. So with the WI Fi we solve the problem when you're at home, in the office, in airport, in the restaurant.
00:03:24.825 - 00:04:25.881, Speaker A: But what happens when you're on the go? So Rome is offering EFIN packages. Whenever you do a check in, you get a free 5 megabytes ECM data package in 198 countries you can redeem them for real connectivities. So with WI Fi and ESIM together we provide an entire solution for the free telco. Thanks Solana to leading the sponsorship to our project and also like Samsung, other big players. As for today, we have some very nice news. Number one, we announced a 20 million roam token airdrop to all the backers including the miner holders and fd holders. And two days ago PayFi and Deepin got together first time with Houma Financing and Polyflow, two leading PayPal protocols.
00:04:25.881 - 00:04:54.645, Speaker A: We're providing buy now, pay later services in the countries where strong demand for our roam networks. Let wait for the TG to burn the points for tokens. Let's bring this free to use telco to everyone in the globe. Thank you very much. Please feel free to download. Enjoy the better connectivity together. Thank you.
