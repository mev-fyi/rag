00:00:00.760 - 00:00:04.630, Speaker A: Do you see blockchain and crypto development as a national security issue?
00:00:04.790 - 00:00:12.970, Speaker B: Absolutely, I do. And if we don't create the environment where it happens here and it happens elsewhere, I think it fundamentally weakens America.
00:00:13.550 - 00:00:48.680, Speaker C: Hey there. I'm Kyle Solani, a co founder and managing partner at Multicoin Capital. Before we jump into this really special episode with Senator Haggerty from Tennessee, I wanted to share some really important news with you all. The Sentinel Action Fund is a super PAC that's focused on using an innovative ground game strategy to elect pro crypto conservatives to the US Senate. And as of the day of this episode, they are now accepting donations in Sol tokens. This is a really big deal. To show our support for this cause, we are proud to announce a $1 million match for all donations made in Sol tokens to the Sentinel Action fund.
00:00:48.680 - 00:01:09.470, Speaker C: Over the next ten days, we invite you to join us in our efforts to elect pro crypto Republicans in the Senate. Any us citizen is welcome to donate. And again, to reiterate, most corn capital is going to match up to $1 million in sole donations. If you want to make a donation, please just head over to sentinelactionfund.com dot. All right, now let's get into the episode.
00:01:14.010 - 00:01:16.306, Speaker A: Senator Hagerty, welcome to Validated.
00:01:16.418 - 00:01:18.106, Speaker B: Well, it's great to be with you today. Thank you.
00:01:18.178 - 00:01:20.310, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for joining us today.
00:01:21.060 - 00:01:28.764, Speaker B: I've been excited about this. When the concept was first discussed with me, I thought this is a great audience to get a chance to address. Yeah.
00:01:28.852 - 00:01:44.380, Speaker A: There's so much that's happened just in the last few months with crypto, us politics, the election, obviously taking more of a focus on crypto than I think a lot of us thought. So I want to start out today. When did you first learn about crypto and blockchain technology, and what were some of your early impressions of it?
00:01:44.420 - 00:02:54.870, Speaker B: Well, my first engagement with it was back in 2017, 2018, particularly in 2018, the coincheck hack that took place in Tokyo. I was then serving as us ambassador to Japan and working very hard in the region to try to stop state actors from acquiring illicit finance. And I was reading the newspaper that morning above the fold. Here's the announcement that when converted into us dollars, over half a billion dollars had been heisted overnight. And we were literally working our hearts out to block in sometimes high single digits, double digit teen numbers in terms of millions of dollars of currency moving, for example, ship ship transfers of coal that were taking place where the North Koreans were trying to obtain hard currency from China or other actors. And to see that size heist take place with that sort of speed and momentum, very, very concerning to me, what I found out was there were 39 wallet shops operating in Japan at that point in time. 19 of them were in an applied for status.
00:02:54.870 - 00:03:56.430, Speaker B: This one was one of those 20 had been actually approved. And interestingly enough, the amount of cryptocurrency that the Coincheck founders had on account, basically was adequate when they took into account the appreciation that took place over the next couple of months, that was adequate to reimburse everybody that lost funds. So in some respect, no pain, but absolutely a huge concern of mine because of the ability for a state actor in that situation to obtain currency, to obtain funding for their illicit activities. I remember speaking with Steven Mnuchin, who was then the secretary of treasury. What do we do about this? And really, my initial focus, and I feel like this is the case with a number of my colleagues today, was concern around fraud. And it was following that that I dug in more and more and realized the potential of this new technology. And as I realized, we've got fraud, we've had illicit financing since the beginning of time.
00:03:56.430 - 00:04:27.870, Speaker B: We need to figure out how to deal with that, deal with it responsibly. But I have colleagues today that only see fraud, and somehow they've been able to only see that with respect to cryptocurrency. We've got a huge education challenge ahead of us. But some of my colleagues, as you know, feel like this is an angle. The fraud angle is a way to move people onto legislation that really is intended to adopt a central bank digital currency. That is the last thing I think we need as a nation. I think it would be very detrimental to our economy, to the dollar, and certainly to innovation in this space.
00:04:27.870 - 00:04:36.380, Speaker B: So this is something, this Trojan horse of illicit finance is something we need to deal with.
00:04:36.550 - 00:05:07.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's interesting you talk about that as your entry point into crypto. I think people would be surprised to learn that you got into this space initially as a response to national security issues. Right. North Korea, money laundering, those sorts of things. But as you dug into the technology, you saw the power and promise of it. As you mentioned, there's many of your colleagues in the Senate, as well as folks in the House, who came to a very different conclusion. We were talking on the show with Rep.
00:05:07.434 - 00:05:38.734, Speaker A: Foster just a few weeks ago, and one of the things he was pushing very hard for is central bank digital currencies, where every wallet has KYC enforcement on it. There's perfect traceability and government insight into all funds that move. There's government mandated decryption keys. I think there's one way to look at it from that perspective that says safety is paramount, safety is important. We should have these type of tools. On the other hand, we have cash, we have all these systems. We have systems of privacy in the United States.
00:05:38.734 - 00:05:48.462, Speaker A: So how do you think about the balance between controls on illicit finance and privacy, freedom, personal responsibility, those sorts of intersections?
00:05:48.526 - 00:06:31.756, Speaker B: Well, the latter certainly weighs heavily for me. One of the reasons I ran for the United States Senate was a desire to bring the power of government back to the people rather than empower the government to dominate the people. If you think about the government's abuse of the systems, whether it be Operation Choke point, Choke, .2.0 meaning you've got bank regulators right now telling banks that they don't like cryptocurrency, they don't like the fact that there might be a counterparty. And what you see is the debanking of anybody with a crypto account or any. Any entity that would like to use the banking system in a reasonable manner. In my view, we've seen this happen with industries that fall out of favor.
00:06:31.756 - 00:06:57.880, Speaker B: One of my friends runs the largest private prison business in America. Again, when I was serving as the US ambassador to Japan, I got a call from him. He basically said he'd been debanked here. If you think about the amount of capital that is required to build a prison, that is a very serious situation. I asked him how soon he could get on a flight to Tokyo. He was there the next week. He was able to address his immediate financing concerns there.
00:06:57.880 - 00:07:12.944, Speaker B: But this is absolutely not the way things should work in America. You shouldn't have an industry that somehow becomes politically disfavored be choked off from the financial system. And I think we all rightfully are very concerned about that happening, because we've seen evidence of it happening before.
00:07:13.072 - 00:07:26.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we just saw that in my home state of New York just recently with the Supreme Court and situations there around insurance companies being forced to no longer service certain clients.
00:07:27.490 - 00:07:59.612, Speaker B: It's unbelievable. And we've seen it also happen directly with the crypto industry. If you think about what happened with Silvergate bank, with Signature bank, both of those banks had very large transaction processing systems that were used by the crypto industry, and they were essentially shut down by the FDIC. Barney Frank, a board member on signature bank's board, said that there was no reason to shut signature bank down. But certainly he seemed to feel that it was targeted because of their role, their prominent role that they played in the crypto space.
00:07:59.756 - 00:08:36.794, Speaker A: Yeah. So we were speaking just a few days after the Supreme Court overturned Chevron deference. Right. A philosophy that, to overly generalize the principle, courts were supposed to defer to agencies when the rules and mandates from Congress on a specific piece of legislation or interpretation of a rule was ambiguous. That has now been reversed. And so there's a few different ways to look at this. I think a lot of folks in my industry see this as a real important turning point for the ability for founders to actually build blockchain products and crypto products in the United States.
00:08:36.794 - 00:08:57.962, Speaker A: The flip side of it is it does put more pressure on Congress to actually spell out what needs to be done in these sorts of situations. So I want to talk a little bit about legislation and how we actually get to a place where we're not just making the United States more friendly for blockchain development, but we're actually able to bring back founders who have already started moving projects overseas.
00:08:58.146 - 00:09:27.810, Speaker B: I've been very concerned hearing exactly what you're talking about. The notion that founders would find a more favorable environment in Europe than the United States, it's just anathema to me. I mean, you're talking to a person, and I think this has been an advantage of mine. But I've been a lifelong business person. I started my career at the Boston consulting Group. I went into venture capital, then private equity. I've seen the power of innovation, and I feel that it's a huge competitive advantage for our nation to have the type of technological innovation that's resident here.
00:09:27.810 - 00:09:37.870, Speaker B: And the last thing we should be doing is creating an uncertain environment and one that would actually push that type of innovation offshore and overseas. Yet that's exactly where we find ourselves today.
00:09:38.290 - 00:10:41.140, Speaker A: Yeah, and I mean, just to speak for this, I mean, Japan has actually built up an incredibly robust framework to attract web3 founders. I know three individuals who are us citizens who have left the United States to go, found their projects in Japan because politically stable financially, maybe a little less stable, but better options than are out there in other jurisdictions. And they found a very warm government reception to those types of activities. At the same time, I don't know a single lawyer that would allow a us citizen to launch a blockchain project in the United States. And so I think there's sort of two pieces that are worth talking about on the legislative front. One is playing defense fit 21, getting through the repeal of Saab 121, which was unfortunately vetoed, but still an important signal for where the legislative branch is willing to take stuff. How do we sort of stop just playing defense, though? Because I think a lot of the victories the industry has been celebrating over the last few months are preventing worse things than the current situation.
00:10:41.140 - 00:10:44.444, Speaker A: But the current situation is also very difficult for founders to work under.
00:10:44.492 - 00:11:18.690, Speaker B: No, I think it's terribly difficult. And you think about the change? Well, it's got to start with the executive branch. Gary Gensler has been able to move in directions that I would have never thought possible. You talk about coloring outside the lines. He seems to have a very harsh view toward this industry, and that has been, I think, unfortunate in terms of the uncertainty that it's precipitated, an unwillingness to move and basically forcing people to file and never act. This has been extraordinarily frustrating for the industry. I know.
00:11:18.690 - 00:11:52.296, Speaker B: But I also think that it's incumbent upon Congress and the legislative branch to do something. The problem that we have right now is in the United States Senate, the gavel is controlled by Chuck Schumer and in the banking committee by Sherrod Brown. They have been unwilling to bring any legislative markup to the floor or to the committee. And despite recent lip service, despite a favorable vote, I thought by Chuck Schumer, that vote was only at a 60 threshold. It didn't get to 67. 67 is what's required to overthrow a veto, to overcome a veto. The Democrats are not there.
00:11:52.296 - 00:12:00.960, Speaker B: Chuck Schumer, in my view, took a meaningless vote, but it does show that Democrats, at least, are listening. But we have yet to see any action.
00:12:01.080 - 00:12:29.478, Speaker A: So how is it in the last few months that crypto has become an election issue? Walk us through from the inside. I mean, this was something that I think a lot of us from the outside have been trying to shout about for years, that we need to increase this. And there's been several champions in the House, a few champions in the Senate, but it was not sort of a party consensus on either side of the aisle that crypto was a major election issue. And it feels like maybe not a major election issue, but it is at least now an election issue. What changed?
00:12:29.574 - 00:13:22.530, Speaker B: I certainly think that it is an election issue. And if you think about it, it really is a litmus test, because in its simplest, and frankly, at the highest level, in its simplest form, you're talking about whether you favor liberty and freedom or whether you more favor government control and centralization. And this is the ultimate test. Right. This is a decentralized product that allows for liberty and freedom. You've got many on the left that would much prefer government control of everything and the ability for the government to come in and dictate how a transaction could occur, to be able to geofence something that they don't want it to happen. This movement toward government control, I think, really should inform voters as to how politically what the philosophy is behind the party and what has moved it, I think, front and center is the fact that one of the major candidates, Donald Trump, has actually spoken about this.
00:13:22.530 - 00:14:03.886, Speaker B: President Trump is pro cryptocurrency, pro crypto, pro the crypto industry, I should say. And, you know, being pro crypto in this environment, I think, really has allowed people to wake up and say, wait a minute, there is a political statement here that's being made. And I think President Trump comes at it from a position of liberty and freedom. And also, I've had a number of discussions with him about this. He and I have met with industry leaders together. He sees the potential for technology innovation as significant. He also sees a real infrastructure need here, and one that, as a developer himself, he realizes the importance of the infrastructure and the fact that it's got to be built here.
00:14:03.886 - 00:14:10.650, Speaker B: He wants it built here. And that very same infrastructure can support other important technologies like artificial intelligence.
00:14:11.030 - 00:14:15.150, Speaker A: Do you see blockchain and crypto development as a national security issue?
00:14:15.310 - 00:14:23.490, Speaker B: Absolutely, I do. And if we don't create the environment where it happens here and it happens elsewhere, I think it fundamentally weakens America.
00:14:24.300 - 00:14:56.656, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think this is something we've been hearing a lot from developers for years at this point. I mean, in 2017, according to the electric Capital reports, 40% of crypto and blockchain developers and executives were based in the United States. That number has been decreasing at about 2% per year. It's down to about 29% as of last cycle. This year, there's no reason to expect it won't continue to drop. And so, yeah, I share your concerns from a national security perspective, that we really need to be able to keep this technology being built here.
00:14:56.768 - 00:15:57.724, Speaker B: Well, I hope that our viewers today will have some hope from the fact that you've got people in the Senate, you've got presidential candidates that really are paying attention to this right now. And I think as this conversation continues further into the political environment, I think we're going to see an opportunity for real progress. I also would encourage anybody watching or listening to this podcast right now to reach out and talk to their legislator. This is something that, as more of my colleagues are educated on this, as more of my colleagues understand the potential for the technology, I think we'll find a more and more receptive environment for creating an environment here, an ecosystem here that will allow it to flourish. So the benefit of me doing this podcast with you today, I think will be direct for my colleagues who happen to hear it. But I would also encourage everybody that's listening today to reach out, to speak to their congressman, their senator, anybody that they know in the system to try to help facilitate a better understanding here.
00:15:57.852 - 00:16:32.080, Speaker A: Yeah, this is largely a group of people that I would say are historically not particularly politically engaged. Right. I think there's sort of a myth that everyone in tech is quite liberal and on that side of the spectrum, and there's certainly some people who are quite politically engaged, but the majority are developers and founders just looking to do their work. These are not people who are traditional grassroots organizers. They're not sort of coming from a professional political activist standpoint, how can they actually effectively engage in DC when they really are maybe single issue voters and they've never really engaged in this process before?
00:16:32.700 - 00:17:47.276, Speaker B: I've often articulated this frustration that republicans don't tend to vote as much or not as engaged sometimes as you see the left, conservatives, frankly, want to be left alone by government. And I think the people on the left, particularly the more radical side of the left, are much more engaged in government control and that type of thing, that gets back to wanting to have a centrally controlled currency, etcetera. This is an issue where I think the real crux of it, the love of freedom and liberty, is something that's going to be on the ballot this year. Because if we don't get it, if we don't change the Senate, if the gavel stays in Sherrod Brown's hands, Chuck Schumer still maintains control. I don't see the recent lip service that's being paid translating into anything. And what I'm deeply concerned about is there's even more power to those on the left that would like to see legislation like that, that Elizabeth Warren is proposing, that would be devastating, that this industry would have the exact effects that you're concerned about in terms of pushing innovation offshore. And I think it would have much broader effects for the american innovation economy were it to take place.
00:17:47.388 - 00:18:12.580, Speaker A: So the Pew research shows about 23.5 million americans have self reported exposure to crypto. The coinbase numbers are somewhere around 50 million. So it's somewhere in that range. But even if only a small percentage of that are single issue voters, that is a substantial portion of the electorate. What would you say to people that would say, look, this is an election issue. These are campaign promises.
00:18:12.580 - 00:18:27.700, Speaker A: There's been years of both parties to do something about crypto, and we've seen very, very little movement. How would you respond to people who say, this is great, but come January 2025, no matter who wins, it goes back to being a back burner issue?
00:18:28.000 - 00:19:10.972, Speaker B: I doubt that it will be. And I think if you look at my evolution of understanding this issue, it might be a case in point. As I said, my first encounter with the industry really was back in 2018 with the massive hack that took place in Tokyo while I was serving as ambassador. But digging in, learning more about it, particularly given my business background, the ability to appreciate the potential of this technology and the enormity of it, this is something that my colleagues will evolve along the same line. Maybe not as quickly as I have, but I think we can get there, and it's already begun. The industry also has changed its posture. I was at the consensus conference just a few weeks ago in Austin.
00:19:10.972 - 00:20:08.246, Speaker B: There is a much greater desire to engage than was the case two, three, four years ago. And I don't know that that's because of deep concern, the overreach that's taking place right now coming from the likes of Gary Gensler or from my colleagues in the Senate on the other side of the aisle. But whatever the case, the engagement by the industry will help push my colleagues to understand and appreciate to a much greater extent, the potential here and to the extent we can get this done and get it right. I think that the time is now. So my encouragement is for those people who may be one issue voters is vote to get out and do something about it. Because if we don't, we've got four more years of bank supervisors and regulators jawboning the industry out of business. You've got staff accounting bulletins that will have the backdoor effect of crushing the industry.
00:20:08.246 - 00:20:46.590, Speaker B: When you can't custody an asset, it's pretty hard to hold it. There are many avenues that are unfurling right now, and I think if you give these overreaching bureaucrats the Runway, theyll continue to use it. I think its going to be up to us to put the gavel. Id love to see the gavel in the republican hands, to be able to bring legislation, actually work through committee, on the banking committee where I serve, to get this addressed, to get it done, to create the type of certainty that will make the United States the most competitive environment in the world for this crypto technology rather than the least.
00:20:46.940 - 00:21:33.740, Speaker A: Yeah. When you talk about those sorts of components, how do we bring the political, will, bring the legislation, change some of these operating paradigms that we've seen. I mean, you mentioned just a minute ago what's changed from the crypto industry side. I think it's that a lot of people took the come in and talk to us open door policy of a few years ago at face value. And they went in and they said, yes, great, we're going to come in and have a conversation with regulators. And the regulators didn't give them any information and instead sent them a wells notice a few years later. And so that transformation, to say we've tried playing by the rules, it's time to try and change the rules, was a really big moment, I think, for folks in this industry.
00:21:33.740 - 00:22:14.860, Speaker A: But speaking of changing the rules, one of the components right now that I personally see is very important for the United States in the future is stable coins. As you mentioned before, you are not a fan of central bank digital currencies. I think a lot of folks in the libertarian space for blockchain are also not a fan of central bank digital currencies. But 19 of the 20 largest economies have active CBDC pilots that they're exploring. The United States really does not. And so the question is, if not CBDC, how do we keep uS dollars able to move with functionally instant finality and continue to be at the global liquidity and global reserve currency layer?
00:22:14.940 - 00:22:39.764, Speaker B: I think you just answered it. It's a dollar denominated stablecoin. And I am all for that. And I'm completely against a central bank digital currency. In fact, I've co sponsored legislation to block the federal government from ever being able to deliver that. If you think about the essence of it, though, a decentralized, privately issued, dollar denominated stablecoin is the answer. There are aspects of that that the other side of the aisle hates.
00:22:39.764 - 00:23:12.172, Speaker B: Decentralized private sector issued. This is anathema to the left that want to see very strong and stringent government control. But those of us that have been regulated by agencies, and I'll say this in all fairness, most of my colleagues have not had this type of experience. But on the banking committee, I've invested in banks, I've served on their boards. I've invested in insurance companies and served on their boards. Same for reinsurance. I was on the board of directors of the largest independent futures and commodities firm in Chicago.
00:23:12.172 - 00:23:58.866, Speaker B: I have felt the other side of this. And anyone that thinks that the federal government is going to deliver an even handed regulatory environment here, particularly when controlled by the left, that see any vehicle of government as a means to achieve their goals, to get around the legislative branch. Theyve done it in the past, and I think most people are concerned that it could happen in the future. And im again talking about choke, .2.0 choke 3.0, or wherever we might find ourselves with aggressive regulators under an executive branch that wants to do so using the financial system as a means to achieve goals, legislative goals, policy goals that are well beyond their remit.
00:23:58.968 - 00:24:10.838, Speaker A: So we've had this payment stablecoin legislation floating around for probably 18 months now or so. Are you generally supportive of the draft in the form that you've seen it? Are there different changes you'd like to see made?
00:24:10.974 - 00:24:45.000, Speaker B: What I'd love to do is get it into the committee environment so we actually can work on it. And as long as Sherrod Brown has had the gavel, he's not done anything about it. You've got an opportunity, I think, in November to change that. I hope we will. But that would allow us to bring it into a committee format. It will allow a talented staff to actually work on it. And as things have proceeded, and again, despite recent lip service to the contrary, the Democrats have shown no interest in doing anything other than harping on legislation that would be destructive to the industry.
00:24:45.160 - 00:25:04.966, Speaker A: So how would you respond to those on the left that say, look, we have the Banking Secrecy act. Whether it's constitutional or not is a different debate for a different podcast, but we have sars have to be filed for any transaction over a certain amount. Why is it so ridiculous to apply this to digital currency? We already apply it to all the centrally transferred currencies in banks.
00:25:05.078 - 00:25:41.090, Speaker B: Because you just said the key point, central banks and centrally transferred currencies. This is a fundamentally different animal here. We're talking about a decentralized currency. It's something that they need to understand. I think that the fit 21 structure actually is an interesting piece of legislation because it understands how the ecosystem evolves and it starts out in an SEC regulated environment for the issuance. But once it's become decentralized, it moves into a commodity environment under the CFTC. It's that type of thoughtful approach that's going to be necessary to deal with this.
00:25:41.090 - 00:25:59.730, Speaker B: And we can't come back in and just utilize old rules that don't fit the technology or try some typical Washington one size fits all. And the legislation that has been proposed, while it may sound good to those who are concerned again about illicit financing activity, will be absolutely and utterly destructive to the underlying technology.
00:26:00.070 - 00:26:53.300, Speaker A: I completely agree that being said, the example that always gets brought up is North Korea. Right. That I think we can all agree that them being able to acquire large amounts of hard currency, digital currency, diamond, gold bullion, whatever it is, is harmful to us national security. At the same time, just as you've said, I think very few people want the government in my wallet watching every transaction, monitoring every activity that I go. So where do you personally draw that line and that balance? What kind of safeguards are important to make sure that the US foreign and national security interests are protected, but also that us citizens and, you know, those in the United States are able to transact in ways that they feel safe and secure about. Not from a compliance standpoint, but from a, you know, this is my money. I'm allowed to do what I want with it standpoint.
00:26:53.420 - 00:27:34.928, Speaker B: Well, speaking of the north korean regime, they've been in business. The Kim family's been in business since the 1950s, and they are, in my view, a criminal operation. Criminal operations have always been able to find ways to finance themselves. It's incumbent upon us to address the technology and to do everything that we can to block it, no matter what form. So I don't think this is something new that's just evolved with the advent of cryptocurrencies. I think it's something that poses a new challenge to us. But we've been dealing with entities and institutions like the north korean government for decades, and we will continue to deal with those sorts of institutions.
00:27:34.928 - 00:28:19.652, Speaker B: And I don't think we should think that one particular technology is going to be the key or the downfall to addressing all of that. Just to put that one into context, what it does, I think, is it puts more responsibility on us to deal with it. And as a legislator, I came to Washington to get something done for America. I certainly came to Washington to make America the most competitive, the most attractive economy in the world. And when I see a key element, a key component of where we have such potential to hold competitive advantage being pushed offshore, I naturally want to do something about that. And I think more and more of my colleagues are seeing it that way. I wish it weren't a partisan issue, but it certainly seems to be.
00:28:19.652 - 00:29:12.930, Speaker B: And again, I think it gets back to those very basic dividing lines between liberty and freedom on the one hand, and between, and centralized control on the other. And we have the left that just seems hell Bentley on utilizing any vehicle of government to achieve objectives, whether it be climate related or you pick your industry that you don't like today, just to stop you from using a currency to purchase an item that they may dislike or prefer to deal with, since they can't get something passed legislatively to just deal with something administratively. That's not what the founders of our nation signed us up for. I don't believe that's what the american public wants. And again in November, we'll have an opportunity to voice that opinion. And I hope those, even if they are single issue voters, if this is what you care about, you're going to have an option. You're going to have a chance in November to do something about it.
00:29:13.010 - 00:30:23.800, Speaker A: The polarization is one that I think worries a lot of people in the industry because what they view this technology as fundamentally pro american. And when that ends up being bundled to one political party, there's this sort of thing where like, we like to talk about the US as having two parties, but we really only have one party. We have two factions, right? The party is capitalism, and we have two different expressions of it, one which is tightly controlled capitalism, one which is a much more free form of capitalism. But when you start to break these things down around party lines, it can be really scary to players in an industry to say so does this mean that if another party is in power, suddenly my industry's on the chopping block again? And that we have to continually push to keep one particular party in power that's the most friendly and favorable, and of course, over time those positions may shift. So how do you think about the polarization that's been happening where I think a lot of people who are in the center feel very lost right now in terms of they feel that the Democratic Party has moved too far to the left, they feel like the Republican Party has moved too far to the right, and they sort of feel very homeless and lost in the middle.
00:30:23.920 - 00:31:34.670, Speaker B: Well, I certainly appreciate the concern you raise, and I hear it very often. I would say that I think the social media platforms have done a lot to polarize America. It gets down to the algorithms that underlie them. But if I step back for a moment and just respond to what you said, I do believe that capitalism is the most effective economic system in the world. We've demonstrated that my colleagues that feel differently need to study history a little bit harder because Marxism has not worked in practice yet. I see many aspects of that creeping into our system from the standpoint of having a great bumper sticker type of slogan, I understand how it can be an interesting means of gaining support during an election season, but it certainly is not practical, nor is it pragmatic, and it does not advance America's interest to push this sort of marxist angle on our economy and on our people with respect to the polarization. I think what we need to do is, again, listen to one another and engage.
00:31:34.670 - 00:32:12.462, Speaker B: You mentioned earlier the notion that the door was open to the regulators and they get a wells notice when industry participants go to see them. I'll say this, my door has been open to people in the industry. And every time I engage with leaders in your industry, I learn more. And I feel like it helps advance the ball. If we could get back to an environment where we would actually put legislation into the committee, in the banking committee format and be able to have our staffs engage with the industry and that type of thing, we would get Washington working again. What has been happening, and I regret to say this, I serve on the appropriations committee. The appropriations process is broken in Washington.
00:32:12.526 - 00:32:13.150, Speaker A: Yes, it is.
00:32:13.230 - 00:33:00.616, Speaker B: And what has happened is weve had these large omnibus bills my first two years there, even though I was on the appropriations committee, we didnt meet. Omnibus bill was passed that I wasnt engaged in. This was all done behind closed doors and thats not what the american people want to see. Were moving in the right direction in the appropriations arena. And I think people will be encouraged by the fact that I am the ranking Republican on the Financial Services subcommittee of the Appropriations committee, which means I have jurisdiction over both the CFTC and the SEC. And ive had the opportunity to bring Gary Gensler before me in answer for the wasting of resources on enforcement actions that have no chance of actually succeeding. But hes burning staff time.
00:33:00.616 - 00:33:23.682, Speaker B: Hes burning resources when that resource could much more better be deployed in providing certainty in creating the right ecosystem for the crypto industry that would benefit America. That conversation is taking place. Look it up online if you'd like to see it. We need more of that. We need the system to function again. And as I said, I think we're moving back in the right direction. We need to be deliberate on the legislative branch of making that happen.
00:33:23.826 - 00:33:47.678, Speaker A: When Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukraine used to be a hub for blockchain development. It was really in eastern Europe. It was where most of the developers lived. And now they've all left. They've gone to other places. But one of the commonalities there is they were able to get up and leave so quickly when the tanks started rolling in because they held their money in digital assets. There's a whole reason for this.
00:33:47.678 - 00:34:49.983, Speaker A: Part of this was they didn't have a ton of confidence in the ukrainian central bank, but it was also this sort of pervasive fear that they lived with the possibility of invasion. And it's one of those interesting things where you don't necessarily think about people in Venezuela as us dollar hungry, but they are. And stable coins are filling a void for those individuals that they can't necessarily get through local economic systems. You go to Hong Kong and even in mainland China, and the influx of crypto there is palpable. We think of these systems as the great firewall that's impenetrable. But there actually is a huge amount of cryptocurrency adoption very quietly in China. So how do you think we can balance the sort of, I'd say, like large national security issues, which put places like Venezuela on gray lists and sanctions lists, but give citizens potentially access to dollars through things like stablecoins as ways to potentially flee hostile regimes.
00:34:49.983 - 00:35:04.831, Speaker A: What is the right balance there? Because in a typical regulatory structure, there's no room to say, oh, if I'm a citizen of Venezuela, I can open up an account with HSBC or Chase and deposit money and get uS dollars and build my exit strategy.
00:35:04.895 - 00:35:43.970, Speaker B: Yeah, the know your customer and anti money laundering rules that we have in place now are there for a reason and long established. I think we're going to have to find ways to modify those rules to address the fact that this is a fundamentally different asset class. But it's something that we're going to have to take into account because the reasons and the rationale are still present. You get back to our conversation on North Korea. We still have to be able to address illicit finance regardless of the type of currency that's being deployed. So I think there are brilliant people that are involved in this industry. I'd like to see more of them reside here in America.
00:35:43.970 - 00:36:20.630, Speaker B: But as we do, as we continue to think about that from a regulatory standpoint, and again, it's going to require much greater engagement between legislators and the industry, between regulators in the industry to get this right. But I think it's something that if we don't have that level of engagement, you're going to wind up with the types of legislation that we've seen come down the path already that would be absolutely destructive to the industry because they so overwhelmingly favorite and or so overwhelmingly occupy themselves, I should say, with the illicit financing concerns that they are destructive to the underlying industry that they're meant to regulate.
00:36:20.710 - 00:36:54.652, Speaker A: Yeah. At previous points in us history, we have undergone capital repatriation programs where we say, hey, you're a company, you have lots of us dollars abroad. We're going to let you bring those back onshore at a lower tax rate. There's some people who floated the idea that it's time to do something similar for crypto founders to say that there should be a process where existing us citizens who are abroad, there's a safe harbor provision where they would be able to come back and continue building these types of companies in the United States. Are you generally supportive of those types of measures?
00:36:54.756 - 00:37:06.732, Speaker B: In fairness, I haven't looked at the measures or the proposals. I saw what happened in the 2017 tax cut that actually had the effect of repatriating a tremendous amount of capital back to the United States.
00:37:06.796 - 00:37:07.236, Speaker A: Yes.
00:37:07.348 - 00:37:16.404, Speaker B: So, broadly speaking, I'm for anything that gets more capital back here, again, I'd have to look at the details of the legislation that you're talking about or the proposal to properly answer it.
00:37:16.492 - 00:38:07.692, Speaker A: The debt is a hot topic in crypto. I think the vast majority of people who own cryptocurrency, engage in the industry, work in the industry, are concerned about the national debt. Bitcoin very famously began with the crash of the us economy in 2008, 2009. And as a hedge against the idea that we cannot continue printing money, we cannot continue running up the debt, and, you know, we're a number of years on from that. But the bitcoin thesis remains strong, is in some ways it is a hedge against central currencies and modern monetary theory. So what do you say to people who are sort of more libertarian leaning in the industry that say, look, when Democrats are in power, they spend more money and they raise the debt? Same for Republicans, and Republicans are in power. They spend more money and they raise the debt?
00:38:07.756 - 00:38:08.564, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a, by far.
00:38:08.612 - 00:38:10.604, Speaker A: Someone has to get this under control, and that's fair.
00:38:10.652 - 00:38:33.592, Speaker B: I think that modern monetary theory has been thrown out the window, though, in this administration. I think they believe that they could print money with literally no cost, meaning no inflation. And that's absolutely wrong. We've seen inflation at levels that we haven't seen in 40 years or further. So I think that has been debunked. What do we have to do? We've got to address it on multiple fronts. One, we have a huge spending problem.
00:38:33.592 - 00:39:10.198, Speaker B: Washington, and we talk about discretionary spending and mandatory spending. There are large chunks of mandatory spending or spending that's been put into that category that have nothing to do with Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. That could be addressed very, very quickly. And I think we've got to have the political will to do that, as well as looking at discretionary spending there's a tremendous amount of waste, as you know, takes place. Look at some of the programs that came through with the pandemic. A lot of fraud that's there. And I think that that's probably much higher during the pandemic than in normal cases.
00:39:10.198 - 00:39:47.230, Speaker B: But it's very, very much prevalent. That needs to be addressed as well. But I also think that the most important aspect of this is that we need to get our economy growing again. And before the pandemic and during the first several years of President Trump's terminal, you know, we went on a deregulatory exercise that was extraordinarily successful. We did reduce taxes and brought in and increased receipts as a result of that, despite what some of my colleagues say. We increased tax receipts as a result of that. And we saw our economy growing at twice the rate of any other major economy in the world.
00:39:47.230 - 00:40:24.276, Speaker B: We've proven we can do it. We need to do it again. We need to get back in the energy business. We need to understand that there's a transition underway that you can't just go in from a theological standpoint and start mandating things that the market won't buy or utilize. We've got to create certainty in markets like the crypto technology arena, and we have got to use a much lighter touch. But the possibility in terms of economic growth and basically growing much more rapidly than other nations is something that will inure to our competitive advantage. It will enable us to have a stronger military, and that will make our diplomacy much more effective as well.
00:40:24.276 - 00:40:49.236, Speaker B: So we will be again in a position where it's a win, win, win at every level. If we can make our economy grow more rapidly, we can increase tax receipts as a result. We can work on cutting, curbing the expenditures at the federal government level. And I think state governments have already proven that they can be fiscally responsible and win with that formula. We do it in my state of Tennessee, and we see people coming in droves.
00:40:49.428 - 00:41:02.924, Speaker A: Yeah, I think people often underestimate how much of US dollar dominance is the result of the United States Navy. And it's a very, a lot of those connections feel very removed from the day to day of most Americans nowadays.
00:41:03.012 - 00:41:42.858, Speaker B: Yes, that's true. But if you think about the ability to keep the sea lanes open, and regretfully, we're seeing the converse of that right now in the Red Sea. We've lost control of the Red Sea thanks to the fact that we have stopped enforcing sanctions on Iran from the day that Joe Biden came into office. And if you look at the Houthis. And you think that that's anything other than iranian funding, iranian technology, and iranian training? You're mistaken. These are proxies for the Iranians, and they have shut down commerce, at least for certainly illicit commerce on the Red Sea. I understand that russian and chinese ships were able to make passage, but certainly not our allies nor Americans.
00:41:42.858 - 00:42:22.320, Speaker B: So that's a very real concern, that we rebuild our navy, that we get back to a posture that we've enjoyed for decades, and the entire world benefits from that. We also see an opportunity. Japan is stepping up. NATO countries are stepping up. But we need to see our allies do more as well. And I think that's becoming more and more obvious as we see the aggression of our adversaries. So I'm hopeful that we will see greater investment not only in America, but across the whole span of our allies, in a national defense and in a navy that will maintain freedom and the rule of law.
00:42:22.400 - 00:43:11.716, Speaker A: So you've been a businessman for most of your career before you went into politics. And if we look at Chips and Sciences act efforts to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, the majority of them are behind schedule and have not really come to fruition. And in a large part, that's due to a labor market mismatch. Match that. For years, we've been pushing a lot of these jobs overseas, and we simply do not have the manufacturing resources on the human side to build these type of facilities. Even when TSMC has come over and tried to build factories in the United States, they found that they're bringing all of the workers over from Taiwan because we just don't have a system that is supporting of the type of manufacturing capacity needed in the United States for this. I worry we're doing the same thing right now with blockchain developers, as we've talked about.
00:43:11.716 - 00:43:34.092, Speaker A: But from a more holistic standpoint, how do you view a reversal of these trends? How do you actually get back to a place where, I mean, I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's easy to provide funding to certain types of projects. It's easy to say we're going to actually build a lot of these things back in the United States again, but the brass tacks of getting it done is a good deal more difficult nowadays.
00:43:34.156 - 00:44:00.988, Speaker B: Yes, indeed it is. I will highlight one point just because I'm the author of the legislation that was aimed at fixing it. But one of the issues we have is the permitting process here in America. And when my colleagues were excited about passing the Chips and Science act, that's got a $52 billion worth of direct subsidies, which I hate the fact that we have to do it. But look, it's not a level playing field. When you think about what China's doing, when you think about what they're doing in Europe in terms of subsidization, that.
00:44:01.004 - 00:44:03.508, Speaker A: Is also TSMC's one year R and D budget.
00:44:03.564 - 00:44:33.438, Speaker B: Yeah, you're right. It's a component of it, though. But more important in my mind was fixing the permitting process. And when you looked at it, and I called the CEO's of chip manufacturers around the world when the Chips and Science act first came up, and I asked them, why aren't you producing in America? And each of them had their reasons, but every single one of them told me this. It takes roughly five years to permit a fab in America. Five years. You think about the pace of technology development.
00:44:33.438 - 00:45:01.210, Speaker B: By the time it's permitted, it's obsolete. This is one of the key reasons why it's not happening. So I was able to get, and I, you know, my colleagues in the Senate know my business background. I was able to get all of my colleagues in the Senate to agree that we've got to fix this permitting problem. And we basically came up with a means to cut it down to 18 months. We went to the House with it. There was a big fight over there because there are certain people that believe that anything that shortens the permitting process must somehow be bad for the environment.
00:45:01.210 - 00:45:24.900, Speaker B: That's not the case. What we did was we forced bureaucrats to process in parallel what they had been processing in series. It's as simple as that. And they passed it, not unanimously out of the house, but they passed it. And thanks to the commerce secretary who understood it, I was able to work with her. She understood what I was trying to accomplish. She had President Biden not veto it and sign it into law.
00:45:24.900 - 00:46:01.686, Speaker B: So we had a big win there. We've got to keep looking for opportunities like that to take hurdles and barriers out of the way that we create through our own regulatory or legislative process back to the human content. I think that's going to have to happen on a state by state basis. Tennessee, again, sets a great example. We've attracted a tremendous amount of capital investment into our state. We are also mirroring that with new programs at the community college level, at the technical institute level. I was just at a grand opening for a brand new facility that we're introducing in the western part of our state that's going to be on the premises of the new Ford plant.
00:46:01.686 - 00:46:18.862, Speaker B: There. But it's called the Tennessee College of Applied Technology. This is absolutely the direction. This is the type of model that can be deployed across the United States. We have to get on it. We have to do it. We need to start inspiring kids when they're in middle school, certainly by high school, and we need to have a place for them to go to get the training.
00:46:18.862 - 00:46:43.034, Speaker B: So it's not going to happen overnight. But if we don't start, it'll never happen. And states like Tennessee are proving that it can. So I hope that other states will see this and that the laboratories of democracy will come together and again put us at the cutting edge. We know that people come here to innovate, but as you say, we need the manufacturing capacity and the human capital to deliver against that. And my goal is to make that happen as quickly as possible. And education is going to be the key to that.
00:46:43.162 - 00:47:35.566, Speaker A: So one of the pieces, I think that's worth going back to a bit, because we've touched on this a few times, and I think it's one that folks in the industry see as a repeated thing that's thrown back at us, which is the illicit finance component. And this is sort of, I'm sure, a hard question to answer, but we implicitly design systems for a certain amount of fraud. Every business owner knows there's a certain amount of employee theft, there's a certain amount of shoplifting, there's a certain amount of accounting slack in the system, and the efforts to bring that to zero will be detrimental to the organization as a whole. And the goal is to minimize it, but is, of course, not to bring it truly to zero, because if you bring it truly to zero, shut the store. Right. It's sort of the argument of the only safe computer is one that's turned off. Right.
00:47:35.566 - 00:48:02.606, Speaker A: And clearly we're not going to turn off all the computers. So how do you respond to some of those questions and criticism? As someone who has been a businessman for most of their career, how do you navigate that, both in a business context, but now that you're on the other side, in the political context, to build policies and regulation that accomplish national security goals, KYC goals to some extent, but also don't stifle business.
00:48:02.718 - 00:48:26.416, Speaker B: Yeah. The concept of shrinkage is one I've been familiar with for decades. I think most business people are. I think you highlight a point, though, that's instructive for me, and I think it's the benefit of having had this conversation with you because there's more education that I could help with my help, my colleagues along with, to understand this is just a practical aspect of doing business. I'd like to have the number be zero in terms of illicit finance. But there's an asymptote function here. Right.
00:48:26.416 - 00:49:21.680, Speaker B: And at some point, you're going to encounter so much friction that you'll shut the system down. So I think you raise a very good point. It's one that I think would be conducive to not only education, but some analytics that would help me understand and better educate some of my colleagues on this issue. Because if you think about the alternatives, certainly cash is used in many, many circumstances where there are illicit activities. I don't hear the same amount of outrage. I've also been through the process of assessing when a law enforcement has the appropriate authorities, they actually can see where a particular currency has moved, and it actually may be more beneficial than just cash. So there must be ways to have.
00:49:21.680 - 00:49:32.418, Speaker B: There's an educational opportunity here that I can see, even though I can't fully articulate it. But the way you constructed the question leads me to believe that this is something that we could address.
00:49:32.554 - 00:49:47.082, Speaker A: Yeah, it reminds me a lot of every 15 to 20 years, the FBI tries to make encryption illegal. This is a pretty reoccurring cycle, and we saw it come up in the early two thousands around. We need chips for encryption out of backdoors.
00:49:47.186 - 00:50:03.504, Speaker B: It was back in the advent of the Internet, they started this when we had 64 bit encryption that was going to be too much. And now we're looking at quantum computing, and all encryption will be out the door. But I've seen that evolution take place.
00:50:03.592 - 00:50:54.510, Speaker A: Yeah. And to me, there's a stark parallel between that and the question of self custodying digital assets, because one of the things that's so interesting about blockchain technology is it is a true public ledger. We have never actually had a better system of accounting than a distributed global blockchain network, because anyone, whether it's chainalysis or trm, any of these sort of audit and financial traceability companies that operate on blockchains, they have perfect access to data. It is all, by default, public. They don't have to go subpoena banks for records. They can just look at the chain. And so you have to think that many of these goals may be able to be accomplished without actually providing backdoors and making self custody while it's illegal, the same way that the intelligence agencies are largely able to do their work based on metadata and not content.
00:50:54.510 - 00:51:34.204, Speaker A: Well, I think probably the last question for us today is you spend most of your life in the private sector, and you decided to make the jump into the public sector at what I think many people would call a tumultuous time. I think many of us were not looking around the us government in the sort of 2014 to 2016 range, let alone now being a member of the US Senate and saying, I want that. So walk us through a little bit of your decision making process to say you've been successful. I'm sure you've had a very nice life. Why take on this public service burden at this point?
00:51:34.372 - 00:52:08.380, Speaker B: Well, one, I'd say it's not a burden. It's a great honor. To represent the people in my home state of Tennessee is a tremendous honor. The trust that they have, you know, have been willing to give me to represent them is something I don't take lightly at all. What brought me to the point of deciding to step into this arena was a phone conversation I had with then President Trump. I was serving as ambassador to Japan, and he called and said that Lamar Alexander, my predecessor, was going to be leaving. And I ought to seriously think about doing this.
00:52:08.380 - 00:52:48.390, Speaker B: And I thought very hard about it. The real turning point for my wife and for me was looking at our four children and thinking that if someone who has benefited as much as I have from the greatness of the american system, I mean, I truly am, you know, a part of the american dream. The first male in my family to graduate from college, someone who was able to change their stars. And this was a chance for me to step up, to step into the arena, and to give back. I knew it would be hard on our family. I didn't know how hard it would be. I'd be gone.
00:52:48.390 - 00:53:34.840, Speaker B: I'd miss sporting events with my kids and things like that. But my sense was that if people like me just found it too inconvenient, if people like me would not make the investment, then what's going to happen to our nation? I think it was incumbent upon me to step up and give it a try. And I would say this as well. Running for public office is the hardest thing I've ever done. And I've had a tremendous career, and I worked my heart out all along the way, and I've taken on hard challenges at every step of the way. This was the hardest thing that I've ever done. And I would also say it was the most educational thing that I've ever done because it forced me to meet with and engage with people all across my state and understand their problems from a very personal perspective.
00:53:34.840 - 00:54:21.910, Speaker B: And it also gave me the hope that I actually could do something about it. And that's the challenge before us today, is to put people like me in a position to do something about it. And that's why I'm working so hard this year to try to change the control of the Senate, because I can do a lot more if we have the gavel, if we have control of the Senate and we can actually move again back toward that business environment, that environment that actually supports the capitalist system in a way that allows it to do the good that it's capable of doing rather than constraining it, which is, I feel, where we are right now. I don't think we're on the right path. Most Americans do not. And I'm willing to and ready to and look forward to the opportunity to work very hard to get us back on that path.
00:54:22.700 - 00:54:29.436, Speaker A: What surprised you most about running? And now having been in the Senate for a few years, what surprised you most about the Senate?
00:54:29.588 - 00:55:22.800, Speaker B: Well, I think what surprised me about running was how hard it is to talk about yourself. And I'm from a part of the country where people tend not to do that. It's something that was uncomfortable for me, I would just say, but setting aside the efforts that one makes to be a gentleman in my context, be a lady, if it were another, it really requires you to get out and to think very, very hard about why you're doing it every day, because if you're not inspired, you cannot make it. It is a hard, it is a hard task to run for office, particularly a statewide office. So that is something that you've got to remember every day. And I tell you, getting into the final months of my campaign, I needed to have one of my kids with me every day, at least one of them. And sometimes they were all there.
00:55:22.800 - 00:56:03.912, Speaker B: But doing it together helped remind me why it was so important. It's their future and hopefully their children's future, that I could have a positive impact on the surprise that I've had since arriving at the Senate. On the one hand, I think very positive. You don't see this on television because the revenue model of tv isn't to talk about what, what makes you feel good as much as it is what enrages you sometimes. But there are many areas where my colleagues and I agree, we actually do get things done. I would also say this. I've been deeply impressed, and this is a bipartisan comment with how intelligent my colleagues are.
00:56:03.912 - 00:56:43.350, Speaker B: We have different backgrounds, but I've been very impressed with the hard work and the intelligence of the vast majority of my colleagues. And I do think, even though we might disagree, we believe that we're there for the right reasons and we're working on things that we believe fundamentally are going to be better for the nation, even though we might have a different lens through which we see that. So I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues individually. I wish we could get more done collectively together. That seems to be made far more difficult now by the media environment that we live in. And back to the point you raised the polarization that that drives.
00:56:43.930 - 00:56:47.434, Speaker A: Well, Senator Hagerty, thank you for joining us today.
00:56:47.482 - 00:56:49.990, Speaker B: It's been great to be with you. Great to be with you.
00:56:50.290 - 00:57:29.344, Speaker C: Hey there, it's Kyle again from Multicorn Capital. Before we go, I'd like to remind you to please visit sentinelactionfund.com to donate soul tokens while our $1 million match is still live for the next ten days.

We need your help, and we need to act now. Again, please visit sentellactionfund.com to make your donation and sell tokens and multicoin capital will match up to $1 million.
