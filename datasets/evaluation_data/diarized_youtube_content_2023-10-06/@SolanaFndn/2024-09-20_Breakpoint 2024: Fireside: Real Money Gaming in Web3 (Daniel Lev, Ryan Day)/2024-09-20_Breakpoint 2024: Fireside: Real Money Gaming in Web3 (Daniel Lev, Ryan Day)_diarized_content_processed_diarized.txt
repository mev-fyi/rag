00:00:02.480 - 00:00:15.257, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. I'm Ryan. I'm head of sales at gameshift. Hello. Hey, thanks for the support. We're here to talk about real money gaming. But real quick, if you want to introduce yourself, tell everyone in the world about yourself, it'd be great.
00:00:15.361 - 00:00:29.373, Speaker B: Definitely. So, yeah, thanks for the lovely intro ride and bringing the energy up after a long day. And thanks for everyone sticking around. Yeah. My name is Daniel Lev. I'm the CEO and founder at coinflow. We are a company that helps merchants from Web two, Web three and really any web.
00:00:29.373 - 00:00:40.581, Speaker B: But we let them accept payments, cards, bank transfers, et cetera, and instantly settle to them. And we also help them with payouts and we'll dive a lot more of what that means and how that can benefit games.
00:00:40.693 - 00:01:04.663, Speaker A: Yeah. And so I guess it's important to talk about gameshift. Right. That's why we're here as well. We make it really easy for games to build on Solana. And so one of the things that we're really focused on right now is this idea of what real money gaming with blockchain can really do for players. But I think it's also important to take a step back and kind of set the context around a lot of this stuff.
00:01:04.663 - 00:01:54.999, Speaker A: And so the esports community in general is there is like the top 1% of esports players who are by and far and above the best, but they also get paid the most and then there's everyone else. And going from the bottom into that upper echelon is very, very tough. And so I used to run the 11th and 18th largest counter strike two communities in the world, doing a lot of payments and tournaments and infrastructure. And so we would run into a lot of very big issues where trying to pay out internationally is a very big problem. And so typically, if you have a tournament of probably like 100 winners, we need to set up about 20 different PayPal accounts. We need to do a lot. And so the infrastructure really there for anyone that isn't kind of franchised at the esports level, it becomes very difficult.
00:01:54.999 - 00:02:07.327, Speaker A: And so I think there's a lot of exciting stuff that can be opened up with real money gaming. But that's on the esports side. But I also think the payment side is a very important thing to kind of like set context for on what we're going to talk about here in a second.
00:02:07.431 - 00:02:37.099, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Totally agree. Esports just generally how payments works today in Web two and any game think of, let's start with a classic real money gaming example, which is sports betting, probably One of the biggest real money gaming sectors in the world. I'm from the US so one of the bigger companies there is DraftKings. And how that flow of funds works is if I want to place a sports bet, what happens is I use my credit card, debit card or bank. Let's use a credit card in this example. And I type in my information as soon as the card gets authorized.
00:02:37.099 - 00:03:16.393, Speaker B: What that means is the card networks and my bank says I have the money in my bank and the money can start moving to DraftKings who is a merchant in this case, that money will arrive in DraftKings bank account in two to three business days. But right away DraftKings goes okay, we're going to credit Daniel's wallet, which is in a database with some funds. I can go and play sports bet with that. And if I win, my database also gets credited back if I want to withdraw that same thing. What happens there is they have to go and use their own cash balance sheet or treasury or get capital from somewhere else to go and pay me out. And in the US a payout is ACH rtp, which is instant, but ACH.
00:03:16.449 - 00:03:17.605, Speaker A: Is two to three days.
00:03:17.945 - 00:03:44.979, Speaker B: So you can see where this is pretty tricky where if I bought something with my credit card but Giraffe Kings doesn't receive those funds for three days and then I want a sports bet, I want to get paid out. That's a pretty big problem, right? You're managing all this crazy float you're now becoming. You're really a fintech managing, doing treasury management operations which no gaming company wants to do that. So yeah, that's like one extremely large challenge in context setting like where we are today and how Noah Payments works.
00:03:45.107 - 00:04:18.943, Speaker A: So setting you up for a T ball shot here, which is coinflow is the payment provider that we use for kind of fiat and offer apps at Gameship. So we absolutely adore what you guys are doing. So tell us a little bit. Just like high level right now, an esports player, if they're in an amateur league, will typically win an event, right? Let's say they win $100, let's say they win $800. But usually these are smaller fees. It typically takes about 90 days for that person to get their winnings from that tournament. And that's just because there's no infrastructure involved.
00:04:18.943 - 00:04:28.703, Speaker A: So just like high level or however far you want to dig into it. How can coinflow, if you were to just roll out coinflow for esports oriented tournaments, what would that look like?
00:04:28.839 - 00:04:58.441, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So going Back to that same example I just gave in that flow of funds, what happens is coinflow is a payments company. We can work with different types of merchants. In this case, Ryan mentioned esports company that runs tournaments. So this tournament merchant uses coinflow. They made a good choice. And as soon as Ryan, who's the user wanted to enter into the tournament, enters his credit card information, as soon as that card is authorized, the bank and the card network, let's say Visa says yep, Ryan has funds in that account.
00:04:58.441 - 00:05:38.777, Speaker B: What we do is we push stablecoins on chain instantly on Solana for fractions of a penny. It lands in either that merchants, it's called the esports tournament wallet or if they're really advanced using gameshift smart contract infrastructure. Exactly, smart contracts for that. And as soon as that tournament finishes, right away money goes to the winner. And then with coinflow we also have instant off ramps going from stablecoins to bank account and the game and the tournament doesn't have to manage any of that infrastructure. They don't have to get any of those licenses. They don't have to go and manage liquidity between moving funds from one bank account to the other or figure out how it's going to get there and the user can get paid out right away.
00:05:38.777 - 00:05:46.831, Speaker B: So instead of waiting for 3, 4, 5 days to your winnings with CoinFlow right away, as soon as you win, you can get your money out.
00:05:46.903 - 00:05:56.071, Speaker A: Yeah. And you were telling me this amazing stat about why people choose to go with one sort of sportsbook or something like that. That blew my mind.
00:05:56.183 - 00:06:34.961, Speaker B: Yeah. So if anyone's used a lot of these sports betting apps, what you find out about them is you can't really deviate on the games that much. One, regulatory reasons and two, they've been around for so long that product differentiation isn't huge. So high 90 percentile of users will pick their sportsbooks and other real money gaming applications based on how quickly they can get paid out. So if you allow people to instantly withdraw and realize those winnings, they will go and use your product more. So this faster money movement is something that is extremely valuable. And we see this not only in the real money gaming world, but in the U.S.
00:06:34.961 - 00:07:16.459, Speaker B: one of the biggest peer to peer money movement apps is Venmo. A lot of people have used Venmo and Venmo is one of their major revenue streams is they have two options to get your money out to your bank from the Venmo wallet. One is ACH takes two to three business days. The other one is instant via RTP or push to card. That's right now going for 150 basis points and most people choose that option. So you can see how much people really value getting that fund square quicker and how complicated it is for a merchant like an esports company to orchestrate that whole process. And while us being able to do that out of the box via APIs and them not having to worry about any of that financial movement really helps.
00:07:16.587 - 00:07:43.529, Speaker A: But man, 150 basis points in this economy, that's crazy. But yeah, so that's why I think one really important thing, right, is a lot of, I mean everyone, I'm a big staunch believer in web3 games like web3 gaming. It's amazing. It's the shit we're going to make it. Right. But a lot of there hasn't been a proven business case. I think one of the things that Web3 Gaming has done really, really well is using tokens or NFTs as kind of a way to raise capital.
00:07:43.529 - 00:08:24.109, Speaker A: Also user acquisition strategies. Right. And so one of the things that happens is if you're paying out and you're promising these players like money, but they can't take it out to their bank account to pay for rent or pay for groceries, which is the big thing that they say in gaming, and if it takes multiple days, you're going to lose that retention. So you've spent so much effort and time and energy to get this gamer into your game, all of a sudden they're going to leave to go to another game because you can't actually get that money out. And so I think that that's one really, really good thing. But on that same vein is we haven't actually seen a Web3 game that has a proven business model or new revenue streams within a given Web three game. And I think one of the things that when we were talking about this earlier, there's some new.
00:08:24.109 - 00:08:41.981, Speaker A: Once you start putting money on chain, there's some really fun financial things that you can do that up until this point, games really haven't had access to before. So like what can someone do? Let's say we have 100,000 people each with $10 in their wallet to go play for some real money gaming in some capacity. What does that do for or potentially do for a game?
00:08:42.093 - 00:09:25.455, Speaker B: Yeah. So right back to that point, when you deposit funds onto the gaming platform to use the ecosystem, one thing that you can't really do today in the traditional web2world is monetize the money sitting on that platform. Unless you're an extremely Large company. So like, you know, people might have heard how Starbucks is essentially bank because they have people deposited and they make money off that. Well, what you can do with stablecoins and other yield bearing assets is as soon as funds get deposited into that tournament, you can start earning interest on that right away. So if you are a game that has $10 million deposit on your platform and you are making 5% APY, that's an extra half a million dollars in revenue. And half a million dollars in revenue can go a long way.
00:09:25.455 - 00:09:38.183, Speaker B: Especially for $10 million in platform is a small to medium sized real money game that's drafting billions of dollars in that platform. So that number really, really scales and can make a huge difference to any game.
00:09:38.279 - 00:10:22.557, Speaker A: I mean I think it's like incredibly important to think about why a lot of times game builders or why would I even put NFTs on chain? Why would I do any of that stuff? And I think what we're trying to or what a lot of people are thinking about is how can we find new revenue streams. And if you can start to impress upon small indie studios or even bigger studios that there's this new revenue source and you can pour that money either back into the players or back into your own pockets. Because that's what we do here, we put money in our pockets. Right. I think that that's like a very important thing. But then there's one other thing that I want to touch on briefly with you, which is if you're a game that's running kind of an international game, you want to have users from all over the world suddenly taking payments from everywhere, it becomes quite the headache running all those money transmitter licenses. So you mentioned that briefly, but I think you guys handle this very nicely if you wanted to touch on that for a second.
00:10:22.621 - 00:10:54.295, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the benefit of using a company that can settle stablecoins instantly is that as soon as the user gets the stablecoins you can plug into offramp providers. We have offramps in over 50 countries but if we don't have it there, the user still has access to those stablecoins and likely there's an exchange in that country that user is domiciled in. And you can create a quick guide of saying hey, take these USCC or USCC stablecoin and take this exchange. Without that there really is no way of doing these mass payouts other than manual operations.
00:10:56.355 - 00:12:10.831, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's pretty exciting. I think there's a huge unlock and so one of the things that excites me the most about this is the idea that if you can roll out infrastructure in your game, one of the things that real money gaming brings into the equation is the ability for someone to come in and have new types of content without necessarily you as a game builder needing to build new storylines or chapters or seasons or anything like that. Because you can just take your existing core game loop and add some extra color on top, but then you throw into the money aspect so you have another revenue stream that I think is really important. But then the last thing and what we talked about or what I mentioned at the very start is you have these amateurs that are looking to quit their nine to five to do what they do their five to nine full time. And one of the things that if a game can roll this out internally very easily, you can start to get more gamers that can potentially leave their time paying job, doing whatever to start trying to chase this down more often. If you're an amateur in Rocket League, for example, you could be one of the best amateur players in the world. And the maximum amount that you're probably making is around $800 a month doing this.
00:12:10.831 - 00:12:37.653, Speaker A: And so if you can offer opportunities for gamers where even going from 800 to 1600, it becomes much more feasible for you to spend more time training to try and make it up to, to that 1%. And I think that's something that's often forgotten about is it's not just sure like blockchain, we can send money around to people, but it's these people who are out there really trying to make it maybe on Twitch or as a pro. And this kind of stuff really unlocks that, which I think is really, really exciting.
00:12:37.789 - 00:12:47.501, Speaker B: Do you think that creates like just a whole new generation of gamers and people trying to become or turn into more than a side gig or even just turn into a side gig.
00:12:47.573 - 00:13:19.171, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think it's really. Yeah. So it turns into something where people can earn money in new ways that I think or more money doing the thing that they love. But also it can go to a long tail of games, right. Like there's only probably 10 games today where this is really like a massive ecosystem. But if you can have it on like everyday mobile games and you don't have to set up a whole league or something to do, I think that that's really cool. But then on top of that, right as a gamer, right, if you're in there and, and you're able to put 25 cents down, a dollar down to go drop into a map.
00:13:19.171 - 00:13:53.025, Speaker A: I think BR1 is a game that does this really, really well. If anyone doesn't know what you do is you pay a dollar to drop into a map and every kill you get, you get 50 cents. And suddenly this dynamic is really, really interesting where now there's a little bit of money on the line and so now you have a little bit of skin in the game and it really opens up a new kind of engagement metric that I think is really, really cool. But this is all we got. A minute and a half left. This all comes back to the idea of one of the things that Game Ships is doing with coinflow right now is we're going to actually be running out or rolling out the ability to do real money gaming inside of games through our API. Very straightforward.
00:13:53.025 - 00:14:37.893, Speaker A: We talk about this a lot already, but new content, Web3 enabled, all of this kind of stuff and I'm supposed to push this clicker. Ha ha. All right. But I think what's really, really nice is we can set all this stuff up with the APIs for you guys straight out of the box so you don't really have to do anything extra tap into this. So if you're a mobile game that's doing kind of a casual thing, you can start to run a cam from Fableborn, likes to call Lunchtime Esports. So you can start to do these small money oriented things to try and re engage players or keep retention even at an all time high. So with the last 30 seconds that we have on the map, I'm going to leave this QR code up there for all you wonderful game developers that are out there.
00:14:37.893 - 00:14:49.081, Speaker A: Scan it and get in touch with me so we can talk about getting coinflow and getting Game Shift into all your wonderful games and running some real money gaming. I don't know, I want to just feel excited at the end of the day.
00:14:49.153 - 00:14:51.353, Speaker B: It's been a long day. It's been a long day. There you go.
00:14:51.409 - 00:14:56.841, Speaker A: That's the energy we need. All right, let's go. Yeah. Well, thanks. I really appreciate the time.
00:14:56.913 - 00:14:57.457, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you.
00:14:57.481 - 00:14:58.325, Speaker A: It's been great.
00:14:58.665 - 00:14:59.593, Speaker B: Thanks everyone.
00:14:59.729 - 00:15:00.265, Speaker A: Thank you everyone.
