00:00:04.080 - 00:00:35.435, Speaker A: Gm. Gm Everyone, thank you so much for coming to our little talk. So I'm going to throw some numbers at you really, really quickly. We did a sampling of a poll about crypto folks just a few weeks ago and we found some really interesting details. About 40% of people actually donate regularly, which we thought was a midway amount. Most donations actually come from credit debit cards or traditional bank transfers. And only about 27% of these donors actually use crypto.
00:00:35.435 - 00:01:18.429, Speaker A: A lot of the likelihoods are because people don't know how transparency of the funds are being used. Tax benefits they can get from it. They also don't know whether or not the donation process is super easy. So these concerns stem for crypto folks based on the volatility of the asset, lack of understanding, lack of security. So where do we come in? BONK for paws and who are we? We are a charitable initiative within the BONK ecosystem and we utilize innovative blockchain tech and engagement with global communities to drive meaningful change. How have we done this? So so far we've launched three fashion shows. The first was in Hong Kong, then we held one in London.
00:01:18.429 - 00:01:44.595, Speaker A: And for those of you who were here yesterday, we had a fabulous one right here at the location. So far we've raised just about 25,000 US. Some of it was collected in Seoul, some of it was collected in Seoul. USDC and we've been able to donate to our eight charity partners via the giving block. I'm going to hand it over now to Tendiz who will walk you through a little bit of the tech and how it works.
00:01:45.055 - 00:02:23.835, Speaker B: So let's talk about the tech. We partner with a giving blog to this. It is an organization that helps facilitate crypto fundraising and donations through the blockchain. You can go on their website today and donate through crypto card or stock. What we did was build on top of their APIs to make something great. We filtered out animal charities that we cared about, elevated them and showcased them on our platform. A user comes to Guangford, PAWS filters to the charities they can choose if they want to donate anonymously without putting in donor info or want to get a tax receipt and put in their information.
00:02:23.835 - 00:02:55.965, Speaker B: Then they select the donation amount and if they want to donate in Solana or usdc, our Lambdas run and get an address for that charity for the user to donate to. And right after that donation, we get a notification telling us through webhooks that the donation is complete. At that point we add that donation to the user's history and we match the amount of Donated money in Bonk along with burning 1% of that amount in Bonk.
00:02:56.125 - 00:02:56.445, Speaker A: Win.
00:02:56.485 - 00:03:18.441, Speaker B: Win for everyone. Why is this great? There's increased transparency. Every transaction is on the blockchain and it makes auditing much easier. The taxes for these charities are so much better and we all know taxes suck. This also increases efficiency. The charities get the money instantly. There's no middleman.
00:03:18.441 - 00:03:55.271, Speaker B: And the giving block doesn't pool it to give it at a later amount. And obviously since we're using Solana, it's fast. Another benefit that is non technical is the fact that it lends to financial inclusion. Any charity in the world can apply and be a part of this. Getting donations despite the proximity to donors. So what's next? Wheat's poll showed that a lot of people want more anonymity. So we're working with a giving block to get a completely unique address for every donation and mix that address up using a smart contract.
00:03:55.271 - 00:04:06.635, Speaker B: What that will lead to is that when user A donates to charity bee, only the participants know that it was a donation and no one else. With that, I'll hand it back to Vit.
00:04:09.775 - 00:04:37.375, Speaker A: So how can you get involved? Visit us at bonkforpaws.org Follow the journeys of all of the animals that we have there. You can also purchase items that are on sale from Venta. 100% of all of the merch sales for the Baobao fashion line will be matched by Bonk and donated via the DAP to our charity partners. Thank you guys for listening and coming out. Thank you.
