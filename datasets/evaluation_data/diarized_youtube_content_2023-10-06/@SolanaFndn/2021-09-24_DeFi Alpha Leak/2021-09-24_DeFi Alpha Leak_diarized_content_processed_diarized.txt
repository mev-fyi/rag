00:00:12.160 - 00:00:12.964, Speaker A: And live.
00:00:14.214 - 00:00:41.424, Speaker B: Cool. Hey, everybody. Thanks for joining us. My name is Chris McCann. I'm one of the general partners of race Capital, and this is officially the Alpha League Solana hackathon series. Or we got a bunch of a great crew of investors and participants in the Solana ecosystem going to talk about some of the cool things that are going on. But before we start, I figured it'd be good to have everybody do an intro amongst each other.
00:00:41.424 - 00:00:44.444, Speaker B: Maybe we could start with Matt. Matthew, maybe you want to start first?
00:00:45.264 - 00:01:02.014, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Matthew Graham. I'm the CEO of Sino Global Capital. I'm today in a city in China that's about the size of Chicago, but you've never heard of it. And we're very active investors in the Solana ecosystem, so it's super great to be here today.
00:01:03.794 - 00:01:05.654, Speaker B: Cool. Arthur.
00:01:06.714 - 00:01:35.364, Speaker D: Hi. This is Arthur here, the founding partner of Defiance Capital. Defiance Capital is a Defi focused fund, and we have been, I would say, relatively late to the Solana ecosystem, but we've been actively investing since March this year as well. Because, I mean, I mentioned this in the multiple podcasts. I think Solana is a very legitimate, smart contract platform that offer a very compelling solution to developers out there, and we are very excited to be here as well.
00:01:37.024 - 00:02:23.214, Speaker B: Good to meet you. Nick, I think you can't hear you. I think your volume is off. No, still no. Yeah, maybe we'll give them a minute or two. How about we could start with while Nick's rejoining. Matthew, what have you been seeing cool in the Solana defi ecosystem?
00:02:24.314 - 00:03:26.892, Speaker C: Well, obviously there's been just an explosion of activity in the ecosystem, and so we're really excited about the tremendous developer talent that's onboarding. Yesterday, we announced our investment in Orko, of course, which we're super ecstatic about. And just overall, we're just absolutely thrilled that the momentum continues for Solana, both in terms of the community. With things like nfts recently, there's obviously been a lot of activity in the NFT space, but also especially on the development side and the talent with the projects that we've been wrapping with in recent weeks and getting to know, it's just really awe inspiring. So overall, I guess the day to day TVL type stuff or price go up, price go down, isn't super interesting. Distinct to me. But the long term improvement in basic tooling, things like Phantom Wallet obviously was huge for the ecosystem.
00:03:26.892 - 00:03:32.224, Speaker C: And just overall, the influx of talent, I'm just super excited about it.
00:03:32.684 - 00:04:00.144, Speaker B: Yeah, it's still pretty nuts to me that even throughout all the correction and all that, there's more than 8.7 billion total value locked in the Solana ecosystem. A large chunk of that being in sabre, one of the companies that we invested in. But literally the speed and scale that these companies have scaled at is pretty astounding to me. Nick, I know we couldn't hear you. Hopefully we could hear you now. Do you want to give a short introduction? No.
00:04:18.224 - 00:04:23.844, Speaker D: Probably, Nick, you can try the select microphone feature. It's probably did not select the right microphone.
00:04:24.704 - 00:04:34.444, Speaker B: Could be it, yeah, Nick, in the bottom left there's a little microphone you could like select. Hopefully it's on the right one.
00:04:49.204 - 00:05:12.144, Speaker C: I have this problem all the time actually, but that's because I must made the mistake of trying to set up like all my gear on Linux. And Linux is such a. I love Linux, but you should not use that as your computer for. For doing podcasts and things like that, or VR for that matter, is my conclusion.
00:05:14.484 - 00:05:17.716, Speaker B: Nick, good to see you on mobile. Hopefully it works this time. Yeah.
00:05:17.820 - 00:05:18.584, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:19.564 - 00:05:20.364, Speaker C: Oh, there he is.
00:05:20.404 - 00:05:21.124, Speaker A: Sorry about that.
00:05:21.204 - 00:05:21.944, Speaker C: All right.
00:05:22.364 - 00:05:22.748, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:22.796 - 00:05:23.380, Speaker B: Quick intro.
00:05:23.452 - 00:06:03.184, Speaker A: Nick Gustafson. I work at CMS. I do a lot of the trading on the active side and been working on a lot of the venture investing as well, which as of late has been pretty heavily focused on Solana. Echoing everyone's comments like the speed and inexpensiveness of the network is just opening a ton of interesting avenues. We've obviously done a lot in the DeFi space. I think one thing that's particularly interesting about Solana, given the speed, is metaverse and gaming applications, which we've been pretty focused on lately.
00:06:04.444 - 00:06:35.644, Speaker B: Got it. Cool. And one of the questions you might have missed while you were rejoining is we were just talking about some of the cool defi and trading related things we're seeing in the Solana ecosystem, at least for ourselves. We do very little on the trading side. We tend to be super boring venture investors. We buy and hold anything from a more active fund, I guess. I'm curious, what are you guys actually using in the Solana ecosystem? What venues are you trading on? Are you using a lot of the sort of decentralized exchanges, or are you sort of more conditioned to just the centralized versions?
00:06:36.464 - 00:07:25.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we certainly don't have a preference, I'd say. I mean, we just tend to go where the liquidity is, to be honest. For Solana right now, for a lot of the time, it's still going to be centralized exchanges that are a little bit more liquid, especially because of the availability of perps. And so I think, not that it doesn't exist, but I think getting derivatives really going on Solana will be a huge factor to open up a lot more defi trading. We certainly do it. We use serum, we use radium, but I don't think it's quite liquid enough for it to be our main avenue of trading.
00:07:26.154 - 00:07:26.698, Speaker B: Got it.
00:07:26.746 - 00:07:27.426, Speaker D: Cool.
00:07:27.610 - 00:07:40.694, Speaker B: Good to know on the context on that side. And Arthur, I remember you mentioned in the beginning, you guys were a little bit newer ish to the Solana ecosystem. I'm curious, what are some of the cool kind of defi things you're seeing in this world that you guys are gravitating towards?
00:07:42.114 - 00:08:48.026, Speaker D: I think we are most excited by the fact that when the team built on Solana, they do not need to worry about the scaling issue, which depending on how you look at it, actually make or break a certain design, and has been a big pain for all of the users as well. And I think that with this kind of scalability Solana can offer, the team can also look at a little bit more of like a blue ocean strategy. Because I think when they come to if deFi, everyone understand that we are not ready to onboard, let's say a million user to the protocol or the product we are building yet. So we actually okay with targeting, let's say like a few, like 10,000 or like, let's say up to 50,000 of core hobbies, users that really willing to go a bit of extra mile to dig out what houses to use the protocol. But with Solana, the scalability and the performance it offers, you can probably think bigger. Like, okay, in one year we want to have a million users. And I think right now, outside of Uniswap, I don't think any other apps alone.
00:08:48.026 - 00:09:19.104, Speaker D: Okay, outside of binance smart chain, they probably have a few million users here and there as well. But when it comes to Ethereum, I think Uniswap is the only one that have more than 1 million cumulative users. None of the other have that many users. And realistically speaking, they probably could not have handled that many users as well. I think when it comes to Solana, this is certainly possible. I think this is something that is pretty big. And I still think composability is very important and it's what brings DeFi to this level.
00:09:19.104 - 00:10:08.134, Speaker D: But I think the recent success of divide ex, which is a very decentralized derivative protocol we invested in, also shown that you also have to optimize for your context. I think Dividx right now have no composability with any other DeFi protocol, but it is doing very well. It's dominating in the decentralized, perpetual space. So I think there are some lessons to be learned there for the usage of composability, but don't be blindsided by it. Yeah. And I think just the fact that the team do not need to overly be concerned about how are we going to handle if we have a ten times or 100 times more users. It's actually take a big chunk of their worry and concern from their mind.
00:10:08.874 - 00:10:25.778, Speaker B: Yeah. I think there's another investor who's not here. I think his name's Craig Burrell. Hopefully, I'm pronouncing it right here. He tracks a lot of the statistics in the Solana ecosystem. I was actually super surprised, like the last one he published, the average. I'll send a link out to you guys.
00:10:25.778 - 00:10:41.486, Speaker B: The average daily active users in the Solana ecosystem is a little over 2 million unique addresses, which is a lot higher than I would have expected. Of course, one address doesn't necessarily equal one user. And, you know, I think 40,000 of.
00:10:41.510 - 00:10:43.234, Speaker C: Those are on this call tonight, though.
00:10:44.694 - 00:10:53.950, Speaker B: Yeah. So. Yeah, but, yeah, of course there's a lot splitting here, but it's actually quite bigger than I would have assumed. That kind of first thought.
00:10:54.022 - 00:11:26.460, Speaker D: Yeah, I was very surprised where I saw that Phantom wallet alone have 600,000 monthly active user. And that's huge, because I think Metamask also have the same number as of one to one and a half years ago. So it wasn't that long ago. Metamask also only have like, a few hundred thousand of monthly active user. And right now Metamask has 10 million active user. I think there is a chance that Phantom hobby can hit there in, you know, one year. Yeah, probably less than two years.
00:11:26.460 - 00:11:28.464, Speaker D: And I'm not even a phantom investor.
00:11:28.804 - 00:12:04.684, Speaker A: And I think to your, to your point about composability and just the overall experience, I mean, I think obviously, ETH is still the monster, and, you know, all these L2 solutions are interesting, but it's not a great experience to be bridging assets all the time. And, you know, we've invested in projects that are doing that, and I think it will always be necessary and be there. But just logging into your phantom or solflare wallet and just only interacting with Solana is just so much. It's such a better experience, in my opinion.
00:12:05.144 - 00:12:36.294, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a lot better experience from the developer side, too. I remember talking to Ian, one of the co founders of Sabre, and he was saying on the Ethereum side, trying to do all these side change or layer sort of L2 things really complicates the developer experience, and it also complicates the user flow a lot. So it's a lot easier to compress it down and only have to worry about one chain, one pool, one liquidity layer, one composability, and not have to design kind of for all these extra edge cases as well.
00:12:37.474 - 00:12:38.254, Speaker D: Yep.
00:12:40.474 - 00:12:59.884, Speaker B: Matt. Matt, any comment on this side and the usage maybe also particularly like a sort of Asia lens? I remember at one point in time, Asia was driving a ton of the liquidity volume and user volume across a bunch of the different ecosystems. I'm assuming that's true, but I'm a little bit more opaque to kind of what people are using it for on that side. Sure.
00:12:59.924 - 00:13:51.774, Speaker C: So, first of all, it's definitely still true that Asia is including China as a huge liquidity provider. And so by observation, Solana definitely was a step or two slower to, to get awareness here in China versus internationally. But that's changed very conservatively in the last month or two. And I think there's actually tons of awareness of Solana now. Specifically here in China is the core of our expertise, and there's really been an explosion of interest overall. We're starting to see people building projects on Solana. Multiple projects in the salon ecosystem are.
00:13:51.774 - 00:14:02.574, Speaker C: So sometimes chinese building on blockchain will prefer to stay anonymous for many reasons. But we already have multiple hire.
00:14:09.314 - 00:14:11.426, Speaker D: I think. Yeah, Matthew would be.
00:14:11.570 - 00:14:12.242, Speaker A: Oh, zam.
00:14:12.298 - 00:14:23.210, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, I think we might have lost Matthew, of course, as he mentioned, Solana anonymous team.
00:14:23.242 - 00:14:24.454, Speaker C: Hi, can you hear me now?
00:14:24.994 - 00:14:26.146, Speaker B: Yeah, we can hear you, Matt.
00:14:26.170 - 00:14:27.282, Speaker C: Hi, can you hear me now?
00:14:27.418 - 00:14:27.706, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:27.730 - 00:15:09.442, Speaker C: Okay. I had to change my, I had to change my VPN settings a little, ironically, because obviously I'm behind the great firewall here. So sometimes I'll just get booted out, because it's almost like you're competing against an AI that you're allowed to use VPN's. It's legal as a user, not as a provider, that as a provider, it's much more complicated. But you're allowed to as a user, but you're competing against an AI that's constantly trying to detect you and throw you off. But anyway, as I was saying, there's already multiple high profile projects that are non driven, that are in the Solana ecosystem that come out of China. I think that's only tremendous interest in building on Solana, and I think that grows by the day here in China.
00:15:09.442 - 00:15:11.774, Speaker C: So we're pretty excited about the progress.
00:15:13.194 - 00:15:32.290, Speaker B: And just curious, like, are most people in China on the DeFi usage side? Are they using it for stablecoin farming, lending, kind of all the basic stuff that we're used to. Is there any like actual particular Asia China centricity use cases that are just different that we don't like fully appreciate over here? Sure.
00:15:32.322 - 00:16:19.434, Speaker C: So I would say that it tends to be more speculation driven. I do think that's the first statement. Many of the use cases do overlap, but they tend to have local twists. So for example, the NFT usage with respect to Solana has grown very considerably here in China as well. But the actual NFT projects have differed somewhat. Instead of thug birds or monkey, there's, I think it was something Mao with a cat is a cat project that's very hot here in China, NFT on Solana. So I think there are frequently local twists and different projects that are different popular at different times, whether it's in nfts or kind of generally speaking.
00:16:19.434 - 00:16:42.820, Speaker C: And I do again think that the speculation is a huge difference. It is. I think it is the first statement to say it does tend to be more of a speculative, primal energy locally, for better or worse. But the use cases can be broadly similar in many ways.
00:16:43.012 - 00:17:07.430, Speaker B: Got it. Yeah, I know this is more supposed to be like a Defi panel, but I guess talking about the Solana NFT space post, the DJ and apes, it very quickly went from not that much to a little less. Half a billion dollars. Looking at Solanasys right now, im curious. Arthur, Nick, have you guys sort of done anything on the Solana NFT side? Have you guys been paying attention to it? Any thoughts?
00:17:07.462 - 00:17:59.068, Speaker A: Yeah, in a big way. Both at CMS and personally CMS, we havent bought any actual nfTs, but a lot of us do it in RPAs and CMS has been actively searching out interesting gaming and metaverse projects to invest in. So Aurora is a good example. We're really excited about that one. And I think they can just do things on Solana that you just couldn't do in the ETH metaverse world, just in terms of speed and cost. That said, on the real NFT front, the real degen stuff, we've been having some fun with that. I mean, I think it'll evolve over time.
00:17:59.068 - 00:18:50.534, Speaker A: Like you've been seeing, you know, at first the Degen apes and the salon monkeys did incredibly well and then it's been kind of slowly going downhill and now you look at the, at the launch list and it's like ten new animal projects are launching every single day, and I just don't think there's enough Solana in the ecosystem to sustain this. So I think now you're starting to see a lot of these launches and stuff is immediately trading under mint and everyone's freaking out in discord. And I think these will just start to go by the wayside. But I am pretty excited about some of the cool art that's being generated as well. So what I would consider more artistic nfts, where they're real artists putting real thought and time into this and building communities around it, that's been pretty exciting as well.
00:18:51.054 - 00:19:11.754, Speaker B: Yeah. I have to mention, yeah, I'm actually, like helping a team on a pure more generative art project called Playground. We're actually doing like a launch with radium tomorrow morning at 07:00 a.m. So around this time, you guys should check it out. It's more of an artistic thing, but yeah. How about you, Arthur? Have you guys been sort of playing around at all with the NFT space at all?
00:19:12.374 - 00:20:01.034, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think I'm actually a bit late to the NFT party, so it ended up to be a pretty interesting turn off event. I've actually not participated in any of the NFT drop before until Aurora, and that was really just because of the last mini prompt from my colleagues saying that, you know, there's this new Aurori NFT project, you should just download a phantom wallet and try it out. Okay, fine. How much does it cost? And I just. So I managed mint to one out of the out of it, and that was actually my first NFT mint. Yeah, I have not even done it in Ethereum before, actually, because I was just a bit late to the party. What surprised me is that more than 100,000 people trying to mint at the same time.
00:20:01.034 - 00:20:23.654, Speaker D: I did not realize Solana have that many users until that point of time. So that was a big wake up call to me that. Oh, actually it's growing faster than what I was expecting. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, my first NFT in the Solana ecosystem and it was Aurorie. And I personally like the art direction of the project a lot more like, I'm just not a fan of DJ. Sorry.
00:20:23.654 - 00:20:45.402, Speaker D: Yeah, it's fair. Yeah. So, yeah, so I think on a fun level, I think we have not bought any NFT directly, but personal account. Yeah, we have been buying some and my curly had bought some BJN ape as well. I think it's just very fun thing to do. And I think speaking on NFT, I think there's one thing I want to mention. It's probably not 100% Alpha league.
00:20:45.402 - 00:21:45.138, Speaker D: I think this new term called game five has been circulating and I think it's actually the more people who have been paying attention should know how big this is already. Although you can argue that Axie Infinity is probably the only game that's playable right now. But you see Star Atlas and you see illuvium, they are all getting a billion dollar of valuation right now by the market. And I think people are just saying that. What's the potential when you combine a very fun and engaging game with some of the financial engineering offered by Defi? It's just everything on steroid. And one interesting observation I have is a big issue with Defi historically is how do you get the user engaged on the product and afterwards also on the governance. And actually I think that probably some way we can insert some of the gaming element to solve this, because gaming community has been famous for very engaged to the game they are playing.
00:21:45.138 - 00:22:00.174, Speaker D: They are actively participating, giving tons of feedback, sometimes more feedback than the developer can handle. I think that very exciting to see the combination of gaming and defi and workout like a monster it will bring.
00:22:01.234 - 00:22:07.814, Speaker C: Do you mean like gamification, different gamification type incentives? Is that your meaning? Or do you mean like actual.
00:22:09.674 - 00:22:09.962, Speaker D: You.
00:22:09.978 - 00:22:13.498, Speaker C: Know, metaverse immersive gaming experiences? Just curious.
00:22:13.546 - 00:22:31.424, Speaker D: Arthur, I think probably like you're building a DeFi project, you probably want to introduce some gamification element to keep the engagement. Because what we have seen is the Apple apathy is pretty real for the user to continuously engage in the project for a lot of times.
00:22:32.484 - 00:22:34.012, Speaker C: Gamification. Okay.
00:22:34.148 - 00:23:08.204, Speaker A: Defi Land is an interesting example of that. That's launching pretty soon. We're not investors, but that looks like an interesting project that's going to be attempting to bring more mainstream users into the Defi world. It remains to be seen if it'll take hold, but it, they have some cool, it's cool graphics and it looks like it could be a fun game. And I think the big question will be our mainstream users, is that the hurdle, like, is gamification gonna work? I think it remains to be seen, but I think it's really interesting.
00:23:08.944 - 00:23:50.714, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I ended up, Arthur, similar to you, I ended up doing the whole mint thing from Aurora and ended up not winning in the beginning. And so I had to go and actually buy it on the secondary market like everybody else. But I love their artwork as well. So switching gears a little bit, I guess given the fact that this is a talk for the Solana hackathon, maybe two questions in combination. One, in the Solana defi ecosystem, what do you guys think is the things that are missing and related to that is, for any teams or entrepreneurs or founders watching this, what are some of the things you think are interesting ideas to actually go out and build or hack on or to try out with? What do you think of the missing areas?
00:23:53.554 - 00:25:04.514, Speaker C: I would say that I'm most interested in what Arthur alluded to before when he talked about blue ocean strategy. So, and I think this is not something that is super predictable, but to me, the design space, I harped on this before in other podcasts and things like that. But I think it's so important that the design space for Solana is so fundamentally different, and I would argue bigger than what we've seen before in blockchain, that after we go through this initial phase of replicating ideas that exist on other chains, people are really going to take advantage of the unique opportunities to build visions that fundamentally can only be built on Solana. And I think it isn't necessarily super predictable, but I think that we're almost on the cusp of starting to see unique visions taking advantage of this huge design space, a function of the throughput and the low transaction cost. And that's what I'm super fucking excited for, but I wouldn't try to predict it.
00:25:04.634 - 00:25:05.362, Speaker D: Give any example.
00:25:05.378 - 00:25:13.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say, are there any, I don't know, maybe avenues that you think it'll go without predicting exact specific things?
00:25:15.074 - 00:25:57.750, Speaker C: So I know we want to focus on DeFi, but it's hard not to notice that people that on this call today, all of us accidentally keep talking about gamefire, even though we want to. Even though we're supposed to be talking about Defi. So I think that's kind of telling in many regards. I think gaming is going to be huge in blockchain. Obviously, we've already seen Axie and some other things that are demonstrative of that. But I think that Solana is uniquely well situated for gaming in the decentralized world. And we are actively looking very, very closely at game five.
00:25:57.750 - 00:26:16.074, Speaker C: We have one unannounced investment already in the space and on Solana, and I think that it's going to be just fucking enormous. So it's hard not to think about that. And it seems like that's true for you guys too, since we all keep accidentally talking about it, even though it's supposed to be a DeFi talk.
00:26:17.614 - 00:26:32.686, Speaker B: Yeah. Arthur, Nick, maybe any more specific examples of things you either love to see teams working on or shout outs, if anybody's actually working on it, like kind of more tangential for the, like, Solana hackathon participants particularly.
00:26:32.750 - 00:26:33.354, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:35.134 - 00:27:13.844, Speaker D: I think there must be a lot of team building on this already. I think that we still need a very big lending and borrowing protocol. I think right now you have mango, but mango is more like a margin trading protocol. Yeah. I think that you'll be good to have a very established lending and borrowing protocol because there's like a core primitive of any DeFi applications like deXs. And with the Solanas, the latency and the block time, you can be a lot more aggressive with the loan to value ratio. And how do you handle the liquidation? Probably the liquidation penalty doesn't have to be so much.
00:27:13.844 - 00:27:22.274, Speaker D: And I think the lending and borrowing protocol are able to achieve a much higher capital efficiency, efficiency as a result as well.
00:27:22.354 - 00:27:22.546, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:22.570 - 00:28:05.350, Speaker D: But probably I'm ignoring, there already is something building on that. This is such a big primitive. I think. Yeah, people should be pretty well aware of this by now. And I think another thing is not new, but I think that I want to emphasize this is actually from multicoin. They mentioned that it's actually very hard to build a decentralized option protocol from scratch. You have to combine it with perpetuals or like a futures trading venue, because then when the options market maker are doing delta hedging, they can use their perpetual of the futures position to offset the delta of their options position.
00:28:05.350 - 00:28:28.420, Speaker D: And I'm not sure whether there's a unified platform for this that exists already. And the thing is, you can even throw in some ammo. So like the booster initially created for the options pool. But yeah, I mean, if someone can build like a unified options and futures trading platform and have a fantastic user experience and bootstrap the liquidity to a certain level, I think this definitely can be very big as well.
00:28:28.532 - 00:29:06.374, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But bar and lending markets is a ton of projects working on it. One highlight for one project, there's a project called Solen out in the space that recently just crossed over $100 million in deposit volume. So yeah, I'd love to see more of these lending markets also to not just develop kind of in their own ecosystem, but also take some of the LP tokens of things that exist and kind of do more interesting stuff with it, because I do agree on the liquidation side, a lot of these can be more generous or a little bit more forgiving on a lot of the stuff, because again, you can actually liquidate much faster, kind of be more gentler about it.
00:29:07.294 - 00:29:20.634, Speaker C: Wait till jet launches, they're going to blow people's fucking minds for borrowing and lending. I just have to say that it's a sino investment, so I should disclose that. But I'm super fucking excited for jet protocol on borrowing in lending.
00:29:21.334 - 00:29:22.314, Speaker B: Cool, huh?
00:29:23.214 - 00:29:26.062, Speaker C: Excuse my shilling, but I am genuinely excited.
00:29:26.118 - 00:29:40.174, Speaker B: I think rockstars, we're investors, I think we have to shill to some extent. But Nick, any, I guess, like particular ideas or themes or projects that you'd love to see in the current hackathon batch?
00:29:40.474 - 00:30:21.810, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think I have anything, you know, new to add. I very much echo the concept, and we talked about it earlier about derivatives, so perpetuals and options. I think that just needs to be built out. And you know, there needs to be some market makers on there, and they need to be providing a lot of liquidity for the takers retail or us. We're often takers on exchange, and there just needs to be a little bit more liquidity there, I think. And I also like the idea of a unified derivatives exchange. But then I'll also echo.
00:30:21.810 - 00:31:05.144, Speaker A: I also agree on the gaming and Metaverse side. I mean, what I'd like to see is a decentraland or sandbox of Solana. And so you have these games that are their own universes, which is really cool. But as far as I know, there isn't a built out, just classic metaverse where you can take whatever avatar you want and maybe you guys know of one that's out there. But that's one thing I'd love to see because we have all these nfts now, and it'd be fun to just like in sandbox where you can take your will be able to take your VX kongs and whatever other avatars you might have. That would be really cool in Solana.
00:31:05.564 - 00:31:35.122, Speaker B: Yeah. Two things to mention on the options space. Everybody should take a look at zeta markets, which won the last hackathon, 100% site options which won the hackathon before that. And I'm assuming we're going to see a bunch of other projects in the space as well. And Nick, to your .2 things on the more pure NFT side, I don't know about these as independent companies, but I'd love to see a lot of people collect a bunch of these nfTs. But there's no easy way to display them yet or show them off.
00:31:35.122 - 00:31:56.676, Speaker B: Whether it's either two d, three d in game metaverse whatever. There's not a lot of options to do so. And then another kind of related thing is the whole concept of fractionalization. You haven't really seen, seen it come to the Solana space yet. There's uniquely and other things in the Ethereum world. I'd love to see somebody experiment on that side and see what they can do.
00:31:56.850 - 00:32:13.524, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I spoke to someone at the conference this week in New York who was working on fractionalization. I don't know if it's public yet. So we haven't invested. I don't think they're raising, but they're working on and that's. Yeah, I totally agree with that.
00:32:14.704 - 00:32:44.814, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah. I think we have a few more minutes, so maybe two kind of rapid fire questions to wrap up. Two questions? Maybe one, are you guys attending a breakpoint in Lisbon? And if so, sort of, what are you guys excited for in that? And then two, I guess if you have any advice for the founders who are going through the hackathon itself, anything to share, any words or wisdoms from the investment perspective? Matthew?
00:32:45.434 - 00:33:19.218, Speaker C: We will have six people, I think, in Lisbon. Unfortunately, I will not be able to go, mostly because on the way back, that would require two or three weeks of quarantine in a small hotel room. And I don't think, I think I would lose my damn mind. But we will have six people in Lisbon, just to answer your question. And then in terms of. I think the question was just tips for hackathon. So, I mean, I guess it depends on the purpose a little bit if the tips are how to win a hackathon.
00:33:19.218 - 00:34:06.484, Speaker C: I mean, I'm not sure I have a whole lot of advice for that specifically. That's kind of a smaller and less interesting question to me. But overall, when we look at the hackathon, what we look, sometimes you see teams that were kind of purpose built for hackathon, like they just want to go in there and hack. What we really are looking to see very carefully is people that are really looking to build something post hackathon. And so we spend kind of a lot of time looking for signs of that. And so that these questions, I guess, are a little more interesting to me, but maybe that's because of my bias that I'm looking for investment candidates. I suppose that's probably because of that, right?
00:34:08.344 - 00:34:10.524, Speaker B: Yeah. How about you, Arthur?
00:34:12.363 - 00:34:40.863, Speaker D: So far, only one of the team member will be in Lisbon. That is Daryl, our team member. I might be there, but I couldn't confirm my attendance yet. It's just I need to sort out whether the process and whether I'm able to make it. In terms of advice for the hackathon, I would say, first of all, have fun and just meet as many. I mean, after you finish doing the stuff, I think try to talk to people. Let me get some inspiration.
00:34:40.863 - 00:35:09.184, Speaker D: I do see some hackathon projects. The original team did not all stick around. They, in the end, end up recruiting other team members, and I think that is definitely a very possible situation. So you talk to other people, just broaden your network. It's always a very good opportunity to see what other people are building at the same time and what other good talent you can scout. I think Rush developer in a very huge shortage right now. So grab anyone can for aspiring founders.
00:35:09.184 - 00:35:14.836, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's for me. Cool.
00:35:14.940 - 00:35:15.624, Speaker B: Nick?
00:35:16.564 - 00:36:03.398, Speaker A: Yeah. I won't be able to attend Lisbon, unfortunately, but we will have a few people there. I believe Joe Ditmaso will be speaking. He runs a lot of our salon investments on the venture side, so we're definitely looking forward to that. And in terms of the hackathon, my biggest thing is to just, unless you're going to blow the competition out of the water, we need more novel projects. I think we're talking about needing better options and lending and stuff. But there are a lot of those projects out there, and we've been taking a lot of calls where people are trying to do the same thing as someone else.
00:36:03.398 - 00:36:20.254, Speaker A: You know, we've already invested in one or two in that space. We're not, you know, we want to focus on those companies we don't want to invest in more. So I think people are kind of shooting themselves in the foot a little bit, just trying to build out, you know, the same sort of thing and maybe just taking advantage of all the hype in the salon ecosystem.
00:36:20.794 - 00:36:46.464, Speaker B: And I'm sad. I will definitely be at Lisbon at breakpoint. I guess I won't be seeing, or hopefully I'll see at least one or maybe two of you through there. I'll be speaking at the main conference and look forward to meeting everybody. And then, yeah, I guess for all the hackathon participants to kind of echo a little bit what Arthur said and kind of what Matthew said as well is have fun. Like, this isn't necessarily creating a company. It could turn into a company, but it doesn't need to be.
00:36:46.464 - 00:36:57.914, Speaker B: Hackathon really gives you the freedom to learn, try crazy stuff. Learn by doing. You can fail. It's experimental. You can throw something out there. You can see what resonates.
00:36:58.084 - 00:36:58.526, Speaker D: Have fun.
00:36:58.550 - 00:37:25.674, Speaker B: With it. Like you don't need to just copy and paste what's out there. Kind of do a boring thing like try something crazy. The whole point of a hackathon is to kind of throw out crazy projects out there. So don't feel shy about it. Try really radically new stuff because you never really know it's possible until you get there and start building it. I think that's all I have from my side unless Matthew Arthur Nick, unless you have any closing thoughts or things you want to say or stuff you want to bring up.
00:37:26.954 - 00:37:27.894, Speaker C: All set.
00:37:28.714 - 00:37:45.014, Speaker B: Cool. Well, Ryan, Tom, everybody, from the Solana team, thank you for having us hosting us. Matthew Arthur Nick, thank you for spending your morning evening with us. And yeah, for everybody listening, good luck, have fun and look forward to seeing everybody's projects.
00:37:45.874 - 00:37:46.346, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:37:46.370 - 00:37:47.026, Speaker A: Very happy.
00:37:47.130 - 00:37:48.094, Speaker C: Thanks, everyone.
00:37:48.674 - 00:37:50.034, Speaker B: Bye, everybody. Bye.
