00:00:04.000 - 00:00:41.684, Speaker A: Today I'm super excited to be joined by Torsten and his new devtool. So tell us, what are you building? I'm building lucid, which allows you to develop on Solana at light speed. Awesome. So what exactly does it help me with when I'm building locally? So you would get a one click install and you have a local validator running immediately on your system. And you can then clone parts of Devnet or mainnet like programs and accounts into that validator. You get account diffs for your transactions so you can understand what they actually do. And then something that normal editor cannot do is you can also change account state either in your test or in your app to experiment and basically be much more productive.
00:00:41.684 - 00:00:46.284, Speaker A: Wow, that sounds super useful. Thank you so much for telling us about this. Sure, thank you.
