00:00:05.520 - 00:00:46.103, Speaker A: Hey everyone. Welcome to Breakpoint. So I'm Tristan, I'm one of the co founders of Zeta Markets and I'm here to talk to you today about Zeta X, which is our vision for the ultimate purpose trading platform. And I'm also going to be talking about a lot of the leaps and bounds that we're making on the infrastructure side to get Solana Defi to real time SC scaling. So what's happened in the last year since Breakpoint in Amsterdam, there's been a lot happening. So Solana has really found a niche for itself as the layer for fast, cheap and scalable applications. We've seen this reflected in the TVL growth over 10x from 300 million to $4.6
00:00:46.103 - 00:01:09.109, Speaker A: billion. Likewise on derivatives volume, that's gone up over 20x as well. Super impressive. And on the Zeta side, over the last year we've processed over $12 billion in volume across 150,000 users. So no small feat there. However, there's a lot more to go. What's holding us back and how do we get the next 10x? So price discovery is still unfortunately happening on centralized exchanges.
00:01:09.109 - 00:01:33.341, Speaker A: Also, congestion on the L1 tends to hurt reliability. For a lot of applications like ourselves, rising priority fees lead to higher costs. And when we at Zeta are doing a single digit percentage of Solana block space, this is like a consideration for us. Furthermore, UX is still lagging. Web two, it could get a lot better. And we're still the third chain by derivatives volume, so we're not the number one. We're only a 10% market share.
00:01:33.341 - 00:02:08.035, Speaker A: We got a lot more to go. And so where does Zeta X fit into this? We want to build an exchange with the performance of a centralized exchange, but with the security of a decentralized exchange. So really give these guys a run for their money on Solana. What are some of the features of our exchange? Essentially, we're still sticking with the central limit order book model, except we're making it 100 times faster than what we already have. And in that kind of model we think clubs are the best. They give you great price efficiency and they don't have the impermanent loss and slippage that you see on amms. Furthermore, we're making some pretty big improvements on the latency side.
00:02:08.035 - 00:02:48.775, Speaker A: As you can see, we've taken it down from 400 milliseconds that you used to on Solana down to 5 milliseconds of confirmation. So that's actually even faster than some centralized exchanges. So very impressive there on the user experience. Side, we can abstract away gas fees now as well as provide a much better wallet UX so social login passkeys, all these things that make it delightful for users. On the congestion side, we found a solution on our architecture to minimize congestion and I'm going to get to that in the next slide. And on the security side it's defi. So of course we want to be self custodial and any off chain audible computation that we do is going to be ZK proven with those proofs posted down and able to be verified on the L1.
00:02:48.775 - 00:03:28.261, Speaker A: So this sounds like magic. How is this possible? What have we done to make this work? And that's where I want to introduce Bullet, which is going to be Solana's first real time L2. We've been building this for roughly the last six months with the effect of trying to extend Solana to ultra low latency use cases. So what does it look like? We have Solana L1 for settlement and data availability and then we've built essentially this L2 stack here. So we have these chain level enshrined perps, lending and spot primitives. This all sits under the Zeta X umbrella as our Defi super app. And this all runs in a zero knowledge virtual machine.
00:03:28.261 - 00:04:13.159, Speaker A: On top of that we're going to have this permissionless application layer. So anyone building in the SVM space, building smart contracts will be able to build say a vault, an algo stablecoin and tap into those perps and lending liquidity that we have. And we know everyone complains about L2s and how they have fragmentation and it's a pain to bridge, but because Solana is so fast inherently itself, we think we can get a really good bridging experience here. So 30 seconds in because of finality and then 30 minutes out, hopefully with a bit of ZK magic in there. And so it hopefully won't feel like you're actually bridging to the L2 too much. And so enough talk, let's get into a demo and show you what there is to see there. So jumping into it here we're going to see the UI that you know and love on Zeta.
00:04:13.159 - 00:04:37.299, Speaker A: So you can bring your own Solana wallet or you can do kind of social login here. So here we're going to log in with Twitter, no parse phrases needed, which is amazing. We're going to do, once we've bridged in, we can actually deposit our funds into the margin account. So we're going to put 1,000 USDC in there, no kind of wallet confirmation that you need to do. It just goes straight through like a Web2 app. We're going to go trade through here, place a trade and boom, straight away. Instantly filled.
00:04:37.299 - 00:05:07.867, Speaker A: It feels like Binance at the end of the day. And you can see the order book also updating every 50 milliseconds or so, which is much, much faster than what you've seen on the L1. So, yeah, where does this leave us? We've got TestNet coming in Q4 of this year. It's actually probably going to be early Q4. We're shipping soon and so we're going to do a closed beta for that. So if you're a ZEX staker, we're going to give you early access. We want to get you kind of power users on board as well as if you're a veteran market maker or trader, we want to work with you to dogfood the product.
00:05:07.867 - 00:05:28.845, Speaker A: So you can check out the link here and register your interest there for the closed beta at ProjectBullet XYZ, or you can visit the QR code there. It's going to have all our socials where we're going to be posting a lot more messages and updates to keep across. And if you're around on Sunday as well, we're hosting a trader drink, so feel free to come by that. That's all I got for you today. Let's make Defi great again.
