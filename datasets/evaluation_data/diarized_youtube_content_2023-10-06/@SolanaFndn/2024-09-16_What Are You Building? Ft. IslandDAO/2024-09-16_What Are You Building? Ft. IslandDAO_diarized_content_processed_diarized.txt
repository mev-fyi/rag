00:00:04.440 - 00:00:27.223, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Takisol. So please tell us what he is building. We're building events, community run events around the Solana ecosystem. We started with Athens Dao two years ago. We had athensdau again past December. And now we're doing Island Dao, which is a month long conference on an island. So we brought the Dao to the island and we're welcoming all builders all across Solana to come here and build and ship with us.
00:00:27.223 - 00:00:36.003, Speaker A: Yeah. And we are currently at Island Dao here actually. And I can say it's amazing. So please come over and thank you very much for doing this. You're welcome. Hope you enjoy. Totally.
00:00:36.003 - 00:00:36.315, Speaker A: See you.
