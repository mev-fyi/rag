00:00:16.280 - 00:00:35.974, Speaker A: There he is. Well, this empty room is doing wonders for my stage fright. This is going to be so much easier now with no one in here. It's going to be great. All right, welcome to this panel on nfts with some luminaries from the NFT space. I'm going to just introduce an order. So this is Emily Poplowski.
00:00:35.974 - 00:00:45.226, Speaker A: Really sorry if I butchered the last name there, but she is the COO of the Metaplex Labs, or Metaplex foundation or.
00:00:45.370 - 00:00:52.534, Speaker B: Yeah, Metaplex Studios. But I like this creative, like, brainstorm of a rebrand that we have, Metaplex Studios.
00:00:53.114 - 00:01:21.734, Speaker A: This is Adi. He is the CEO and founder of Apply Blockchain, which is sort of a freelancing company that builds products on chain. And this over here, my man, the myth, the legend. This is Whitey. He is the co founder of Solanart. You might know it if you've ever bought an NFT. And this over here is the CEO, founder, everything VR, all art veto.
00:01:21.734 - 00:01:49.454, Speaker A: So he both has founded VR All Art, which is working on advanced protocols for NFT on Solana. And he is the founder of Solsea, another marketplace on Solana. So welcome. Oh, also, I'm Jordan. So I work for Solana Labs, and we do a lot of work. I've done a lot of contributions to Metaplex, so that's why I'm up here. All right, let's get started.
00:01:49.454 - 00:02:15.974, Speaker A: Okay, so I think it would be good to start sort of looking back at the past right before we move forward. So what Solana NFT projects, I mean, like, what Solana NFT projects are there that we could learn the most from? Like, I'm thinking, you know, things didn't go as well or someone tried something new and we sort of learned a new thing about how people behave in the NFT ecosystem from it.
00:02:16.994 - 00:02:41.370, Speaker B: Yeah. So, first of all, shout out to Jordan and Vartas. You guys kind of started the whole metaplex thing. So I want to take this moment and tell you guys, I think of you guys as my meta dads. It's hard, but, yeah. So, nfTs, they're forms of digital ownership, but the trend that we're seeing goes beyond that now. It's like, here's my NFT.
00:02:41.370 - 00:03:25.300, Speaker B: And this is a demarcation of who I am, what communities I belong into. So really what we're aping into is a digital identity that we ourselves control. And I think that's really important to maintain that spirit. I have pulled up on my phone, and we can look at it later. But Facebook, they trademarked the word meta, and we can hear about their ideas of that digital ownership. So going back and talking very humorously about things that haven't gone right or haven't gone as expected is sort of the features that you worked on, Jordan, with candy machine and Fairlaunch, where folks are dropping 10,000 NFT profile pictures. And again, these are early experimentations with digital identity, and bots are taking advantage of it.
00:03:25.300 - 00:03:49.364, Speaker B: So with Fairlaunch, it's gotten a lot better and it's harder now for bots to swoop up all the nfts. Still not impossible, but basically humans and bots have the same chance of getting an NFT. So I think in terms of growing this thing to the moon, which we're all here to do today and reaching the mainstream audiences, it's all going to be about safety and security. And that's the hard work I've signed up to do today.
00:03:50.744 - 00:03:51.564, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:03:53.224 - 00:03:55.552, Speaker A: Who's next? Adi? Whitey?
00:03:55.688 - 00:03:56.564, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:03:58.064 - 00:03:58.920, Speaker A: Vito.
00:03:59.072 - 00:03:59.416, Speaker C: I know.
00:03:59.440 - 00:04:00.152, Speaker A: You got an opinion?
00:04:00.208 - 00:04:00.920, Speaker E: Okay.
00:04:01.072 - 00:04:04.724, Speaker C: No, you asked the question, like, how it all started, right?
00:04:05.184 - 00:04:10.648, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, what? NFT projects have taught you interesting lessons. And what are those lessons?
00:04:10.776 - 00:04:48.198, Speaker C: I want to tell you a bit about history. We've been involved in the art market and the blockchain industry since 2017, basically. And the hype word in the art market at that time was blockchain, not nfts, right? And everybody was talking about provenance on chain, like tracking the ownership on chain and things like that. But the art market was not ready. They were like, yeah, but we don't want to track yet. We don't know how to implement this, this and that. And at that time, NFTs actually, I mean, they do did exist, like the cryptokitties and things, but it was not closely connected to the art market.
00:04:48.198 - 00:05:59.458, Speaker C: But I can tell you what happened to us last year and then beginning of this year. So last year when COVID struck, Viet is a platform, virtual reality platform for museums, galleries, collectors and artists. And then everybody needed virtual exhibitions, like right now, like, it was like, not tomorrow. Like, do you have something today? And then it moved into the virtual arena, right? Kind of what we will expect to be the metaverses of the future. But then beginning of this year, when the NFT boom happened, basically with sales of crypto punks, then the whole art market, all our clients on VRL art started asking like, hey, can I get an NFT? Like, can I sell the NFT? And then suddenly NFTs became a thing for the art market. So can you imagine like, in 2017, everybody propagating blockchain in the art market, and then only when the real sales of cryptopunks actually happened is the moment of kind of realization that NFTs could bring something more to the whole world of art than just, you know, like, selling JPegs. But we are still selling jpegs.
00:05:59.458 - 00:06:30.450, Speaker C: So I think that, you know, that. And also, an interesting note on actually what we've been all building in the last couple of months is that when we started all our protocol one on Solana hackathon, the second Solana hackathon, and you started building metaplex, that was kind of in a similar times, we thought that auctions will be the thing, right? Yeah, one on ones. And then we build these auction things, and, you know, like, we were focusing on totally different things.
00:06:30.522 - 00:06:38.314, Speaker A: Yeah. If I had only known, I would have just gone straight for candy barriers. Just want to drop it just 10,000 in a row.
00:06:38.434 - 00:07:00.544, Speaker C: I think that we cannot foresee the future. I mean, we don't know what people will really demand. Like, where will be this hotspot? Where's the party? You know, like, that's what I was saying to the team a couple of months ago, like, we're gonna go where the big party is, and that's where we're gonna dance. So currently, the dance is not in the art market, but I hope that the dance will be there soon.
00:07:02.724 - 00:07:58.034, Speaker D: Yeah. As you said, it seemed that NFT market are still like big wave. It's always full up or full down. There is no stabilization in it. And I think it's like every cryptocurrency where once it's really, you have to find a stabilization with, with new people entering into it, and when you know, to find also a new utility to it and being able to propose things and actually make people use NFT and give them use case about it. So, you know, people, people will actually like. And as you said, there needs to be more than jpegs, because currently almost all of the market is based only on this.
00:07:58.034 - 00:08:27.374, Speaker D: And I think, for example, a project like Solstead, where you could see all of your NFT in the wallet, where with only your house or only NFT, you could actually see all the NFT of that person. And I think that's things like that, that implement other NFT into NFT and function like that, and utility, and this is the things that I think will bring more people into it. And.
00:08:29.834 - 00:08:31.602, Speaker A: So on that note, that kind of brings.
00:08:31.658 - 00:09:13.210, Speaker E: Oh, yes, I was going to say I've got maybe a slightly different angle to it. So we're relatively new to Solana, I guess, applied blockchain. We've been around since 2015. So we were building initially on Ethereum, we built a lot on Algorand, and now we're coming into the Solana ecosystem and we build bespoke solutions. So we've been building NFT platforms for. We've been fortunate enough to work with some really big artists, some of the biggest in the world, in the UK, in the physical space and in the digital space. So we've been building platforms where people need, I guess, more than what they would get from a standard platform because they're doing some kind of special issuance and there's some special things that go around that that's really what we specialize in.
00:09:13.210 - 00:09:32.356, Speaker E: So it's great to see in the Solana space that you've got some real cool core platforms and you've got some platforms that are really able to service a lot of people and a lot of needs. But I guess you're always going to get the special projects that want to do things differently or they want to do things their own way, and that's really where we come in.
00:09:32.460 - 00:09:55.348, Speaker A: So with these artists that you're now talking to, which is kind of like a segue from Vito, people are now taking the system seriously, I guess. What is the format that is most common? Is it like one of one auctions? Are they sort of specialized drops? What are we seeing now from bigger brands that are looking to come into the space? Because it's not quite the same as a ten k drop.
00:09:55.396 - 00:10:38.024, Speaker E: I suspect we're seeing a mix. We're seeing a lot of experimentation, just like what everybody's doing. I think you've got that with some of the bigger, more established names as well. There's one project we've been working on which has got a mix of physical and digital. So there's a load of physical paintings that were created and locked up somewhere, and then there's a bunch of digital nfts that were sold and are spinning around and generating this whole secondary market and new revenue for the artist and the digital space. With a high value artist, we see really more small drops, single drops, and a bit more careful activity, I guess.
00:10:38.444 - 00:10:39.028, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:10:39.116 - 00:10:42.950, Speaker E: But we're going to see fractionalization. We're going to see a lot more things from all these guys.
00:10:43.022 - 00:11:10.954, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, speaking of which, I saw the first ever fractionalization yesterday from the fracked crew. So it's now fractionalization with a k. Highly invite you all to check it out on Twitter. It's fantastic. But yeah, I guess in that vein of sort of new ideas, you are all very knowledgeable in the space. What do you think needs to be built next? What is sort of the next wave of nfts and what tools need to be built to enable them?
00:11:11.954 - 00:11:49.684, Speaker B: Yeah. So I actually have plotted out the growth of daily mints for the Solana ecosystem and also the growth of the Ethereum. And what's accelerated the Solana ecosystem is a couple of different virtues. The first is this idea of digital identity and the projects associated with that we saw with dgen apes. That was a huge spike in terms of our growth. And then actually with candy machine that spiked it as well. And then it's the question of like now people have these nfts, what are they doing? So in most recent months, whenever there's a launch of a new marketplace, or for example, FDX's marketplace is huge.
00:11:49.684 - 00:12:45.524, Speaker B: Phantom having nfts available in their wallet was huge. We saw additional growth spikes. So the idea that I have these nfts really leads to the question of, okay, what can I do with them? And I think what's always going to be on the forefront is gaming, right? So gaming is going to figure out the utility of these nfts and also the new economies built upon these nfts. Because again, right, when you think of nfts, the web in web3 is read, write, own. And NFT is a huge part of that ownership layer. So I almost want to suggest today that we need like another Solana conference, one just focused, rely on gaming as it relates to getting into the real world and like other applications. Not to say gaming are not the real world to me some days, but I really think it's going to come from third world countries or developing nations, because they really need this more than anyone else.
00:12:45.524 - 00:13:23.536, Speaker B: Like in the United States where I'm from, we have the ultimate smart contract already, which is if I don't agree with someone, I go into the court of the law and I sue their ass. But in developing nations, there is no recourse. And hearing stories of people in Venezuela or all these places that are getting Solana wallets, evangelizing them in their community, and it's fighting inflation is just amazing to hear. So the last thing I'll say is just one really powerful idea. Us in the developing world. I know there's a lot of people from Europe here today, we can take out loans, we can take out interest against our house. And one person from my team earlier this week, was saying that in the developing world, you can't.
00:13:23.536 - 00:13:50.844, Speaker B: So everyone knows that this is your house, but the government doesn't recognize it. So if that developing world was able to say, here's my house, it's an NFT, and we recognize it, then they could take out loans, start a business, and really grow their economies. So that's what gets me really excited. And I think we in the Solana ecosystem, as much as we are good at technology, we have to also be good at marketing and explaining people different ideas and use cases like that that apply to their lives.
00:13:55.044 - 00:14:31.508, Speaker E: I was going to add to that. I think one of the next big steps in Solana, but also in the rest of the space, is the user experience. And with some of the jobs we've been involved in, obviously we see a lot of activity from the crypto community, but we also got a lot of people drawn in from outside. And I can say that just dealing with family and friends and all the rest of it, I think that the wallets have come a long way and the platforms have come a long way since we've been working on it, and they're much smoother now than they used to be. But for somebody just coming in cold, it's still really hard. I have to get on calls and I have to explain things to people. I have to see their screen, and it's just really hard.
00:14:31.508 - 00:14:33.372, Speaker E: Right. There's still a lot of friction there.
00:14:33.468 - 00:14:34.264, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:14:34.724 - 00:14:37.224, Speaker E: And I think that's the thing we need to conquer.
00:14:39.364 - 00:15:31.044, Speaker D: Personally, I think that the next big step in NFT will be to adding more liquidity to it, because currently, basically, you can enter the market pretty easily. Like, you just buy one at the floor. But when you want to sell, if you want to sell fast, the only way that you have is having a bid already, that you want to sell at that price or selling below the flow and actually even have to wait for someone to buy your NFT. So I think that a huge step will be to add liquidity so people could exit more easily. And, and, yeah, it will maybe hold the floor way more, and the price will be much appreciated thanks to this. So this is something that would like to work on it and, yeah, and add it to a marketplace. Here.
00:15:32.864 - 00:16:44.490, Speaker C: Let me tell you what you just said to reference what you just said when you said, you said one word, recognize, like the NFT real estate, to be recognized and then treated as real estate. This word recognize will take ten to 20 years at least, because governments need to understand, they need to apply, they need to change their systems, complete systems, in order for us to be able to recognize something from the real world as an official, let's say, documentation or a standard in the digital world. So this transformation will take years, and we need to fight for it. They will not do it. So we need to get people organized, we need to get lobbying, we need to get people inside of the government institutions, literally inside us, to get these things first explained. User experiences for, you know, like old people that are working, you know, like every day, maybe on their computers, just maybe to get the nfts where they belong to. That's the first thing.
00:16:44.490 - 00:16:52.090, Speaker C: The second thing that when you said, like, what should we build next? I can tell you what we are building next together with you.
00:16:52.282 - 00:16:52.842, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:52.938 - 00:17:56.448, Speaker C: Is standards for nfts in different verticals, because what is currently traded is like jpegs with just the core metadata features. And what we are in, all our protocol doing is, I think we are first in the world to put the license agreement attached to the NFT so that when an NFT travels from hand to hand, actually there is a license attached to it, which means that the buyer and the seller, they know what they are getting. Like, what are the rights they can use this for? Maybe in gaming that, that will not be important, but in some other areas it will be very important. And on top of that, we have different verticals that are coming into the nfts. They don't have the infrastructure needed to actually convert to nfts, like music licenses that they treat nfts differently than gaming or for example, film. So if we want to get movie producers to come in and use NFTs as a funding mechanism, we need to build them the proper tools to do that. And of course, the standards to do that.
00:17:56.448 - 00:18:36.082, Speaker C: So, on topic of that, Jordan and the team here, we are planning some huge things. But I want to add one more thing on gaming, because as you said, gaming is big. We are proudly developed first Unity Solana wallet. I think on Solana. And today after this panel, I think 12:00 our colleague VUC will guide you through how to implement Unity Solana Wallet. But what is also interesting is that we now have nfts implemented in Unity Solana Wallet. So you will see that on stage here, how the game can interact with the nfts directly in unity.
00:18:36.082 - 00:18:39.178, Speaker C: So, I mean, I invite everybody.
00:18:39.346 - 00:19:20.364, Speaker A: Yeah, it'd be quite cool. Yeah, I guess on that front. I mean, so licensing is kind of an interesting thing to talk about, talk about here, right? So right now on Metaplex and really nfts generally, we just kind of implicitly assume, like if you're holding the token, you kind of have either the rights to display it or you own the thing entirely. It's always implicit. There's no explicit, you know, nothing's written down yet. So what do we start to do? To start, I guess, to make these things more opinionated about what you could do with them and also how do we enforce it?
00:19:23.784 - 00:20:04.698, Speaker B: I think you floated that conversation to me, but it was actually better answered by you guys in the hacker house the other day on the brainstorm of how to extend the metadata standard. So as we understand the use cases and what people want to do with the nfTs, that is coming back to the metadata standard and really imagining it from the ground up and making it better. I know it's also kind of an uncomfortable word, but immutable are nfts that can change, that have application layer? I think the Internet has always been read write and that's been really fun with some of the utilities. So we're going to see more of that for sure. But yeah, I'd love for you guys to share the metadata standard and what you guys were talking about.
00:20:04.826 - 00:20:42.630, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess we'll just briefly go over it. Basically the way that the metaplex system is set up is that the metadata standard is meant to be extended and it's extended through the concept of program derived addresses. You use the min id as the seed of your program address and that is essentially what makes a metadata. But any additional accounts, you can still use the minid as a seed. And you can either use a different program or a different string in the seed to sort of create a different address that is derived from the main program address concept. Allows you to essentially decorate a mint with additional information. That's all metadata is its decoration.
00:20:42.630 - 00:21:23.564, Speaker A: And that's like layers of an onion. So we built the first layer of the onion. And the idea is with VRL art because they are sort of specialists in, you know, museum curation, you know, art, music, because they understand the licensing needs. Because, you know, Vito's just, you know, he's everywhere, basically focusing on building different smart contracts that add different decoration for each major vertical. So every vertical has the same metadata at its core. Same name, same symbol, same Uri. But additional information is included in the vertical contracts that help them actually be useful in the real world.
00:21:23.564 - 00:21:33.284, Speaker A: And so I'm excited to see Vito and other companies like his sort of pursue that because that's how the standard grows. It's just extensions on top of extensions. You have onion layers.
00:21:33.664 - 00:21:42.004, Speaker C: And it will make us different than Ethereum, for example. It will make the whole Solana ecosystem work better than what's happening on Ethereum.
00:21:43.184 - 00:22:11.528, Speaker E: I haven't seen what you're doing there, but if it's something that can be understood by a contract, by a small contract, for example, and can be decoded and verified on chain, then that would sound okay. Off chain legal terms, that's quite tough. Right. Because that takes out some of the fluidity and some of the liquidity even. Because what if I don't agree with some of those terms? I'm not going to purchase that now. We're going to negotiate the terms. So there's friction there.
00:22:11.528 - 00:22:12.168, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:22:12.336 - 00:22:16.552, Speaker A: That's how now we get into enforcement. And this is kind of an interesting question.
00:22:16.608 - 00:22:17.680, Speaker C: And user interfaces.
00:22:17.792 - 00:22:18.088, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:18.136 - 00:22:33.474, Speaker C: Because the first version, I'll tell you, like the first version that, that we built, you go. And then you select different license rights and then they're embedded on chain. Right. But the process of selecting these rights is like you need a lawyer, basically.
00:22:33.594 - 00:22:35.266, Speaker A: I remember that demo. Yeah.
00:22:35.290 - 00:22:36.082, Speaker C: You remember, I was like, what the.
00:22:36.098 - 00:22:37.214, Speaker A: Heck is going on?
00:22:37.914 - 00:22:55.602, Speaker E: And I was thinking when you were saying earlier about, does it give me the right to the JPEG and so on, I was thinking about our web address. So we've got applyblockchain.com dot. Now, that doesn't give me any legal rights on the company. It doesn't even say necessarily that whoever's residing at applied blockchain.com represents the apply blockchain company. Right.
00:22:55.658 - 00:22:56.858, Speaker A: Yeah, you could be squatting.
00:22:57.026 - 00:23:14.326, Speaker E: Yeah. But it's a digital signal that does actually give me something because we happen to have, there's another company in the US that's trying to go around with the same name, and we've got the.com. So I think with the NFT, you've got something there that kind of gives you a digital handle on something. Right. Which is meaningful in its own. Right.
00:23:14.490 - 00:24:09.034, Speaker A: It kind of needs, yeah, I agree. It needs to all be on chain. And then also it brings up the interesting idea of, like, so it's on chain, you can still right click and save as. And obviously for a mortgage or a house tee, that doesn't count. But for art, I've sort of been interested because people always ask me like, hey, this royalties thing that you've built, how does it enforce? It's really not, it's completely optional, but the secondaries choose to enforce it. And so sort of a question going forward, I think I'd be interested to hear your opinions on this like, do we seek to enforce more things like that, enforce the royalties at deeper levels, or do we kind of let it be based on, I don't know, a social contract essentially is what's going on now. Like, to what extent are we laissez faire here?
00:24:09.414 - 00:24:30.914, Speaker B: I think for the next growth spurt we're going to have to get more audiences. We talked about ux, we talked about wallets. But I want to know for like, a lot of artists entering the space, they need verification and need these tools because it's their business. So I would argue it should be enforced and that would get more of the general population involved.
00:24:33.114 - 00:24:35.814, Speaker C: I can tell you war stories about verification.
00:24:36.314 - 00:24:39.094, Speaker A: He's got stories. But Adi, what do you think?
00:24:39.674 - 00:24:40.986, Speaker E: Sorry, I lost the thread.
00:24:41.090 - 00:24:47.498, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. So sort of like do we enforce things like royalties, license rights and if so, how?
00:24:47.626 - 00:25:22.214, Speaker E: Right, so we get a lot of people coming to us asking, as I'm sure you all do, wanting to issue nfts and artists and so on. There's a lot of assumptions people make that we then have to kind of give them the reality as we understand it. And one of them is the artists just assume that with the NFTs, they're automatically getting royalties for the lifetime of the NFT. And as you said, that's not the case. In my case, it's optional, but I'm not sure it has to be optional. I mean, I think it can be enforced. And I think because the demand is there from the artists, then I think that probably is the way forward because that's part of the attraction for them, of the platform.
00:25:23.274 - 00:25:24.426, Speaker A: What do you think, whitey?
00:25:24.570 - 00:26:09.006, Speaker D: Well, I think that, yeah, the artist should ask for it. And actually the platform called do what the artist want to do, actually, because, you know, in blockchain and web3, for example, where the community has the decision, so we could just listen to what people want to do, actually. And people who are listed on the marketplace decide for themselves basically what they want. Our goal is to provide tools for them and function and. Yeah, and all this kind of stuff. And so judges decide to use it or not, and some collection has to disable their royalties and. Yeah, I think it's just about what the creators want.
00:26:09.006 - 00:26:09.874, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:26:12.254 - 00:26:19.150, Speaker E: I was going to add that I think one of the real fundamental attractions of the NFT is the liquidity. Right. You can move around between marketplaces.
00:26:19.342 - 00:26:19.862, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:19.958 - 00:26:43.506, Speaker E: That's fundamental, that you're not stuck in one place. So I think the rules need to go with it. I think that's part of it. And I think one of the technical reasons why we haven't done it up to now in most projects is because you might be moving things to your own wallet. And then what do you do? You do a price zero, or you do. You don't want royalties to kick in when you're just doing things yourself between your own wallets.
00:26:43.610 - 00:26:50.804, Speaker A: Totally agree. If you enforce it. But I think that's solvable challenges. Yeah. What do you think, Vito?
00:26:52.544 - 00:27:23.540, Speaker C: Difficult questions. So, first, verification. Okay, so let's talk briefly about verification. So what is verification? Like? Do we say this thing is verified because it was minted from a certain source, or this thing is verified because the creator is verified because his creations are verified. Okay, so what we got on salsei, I mean, it's hundreds of cases. Not hundreds, maybe thousands. One example.
00:27:23.540 - 00:27:38.812, Speaker C: People call us, hey, verify my collection. You know, they jump on Twitter, they jump on discord. They yell. They yell, like, why not? My collection is verified. And then, you know, you ask them, okay, provide us the proof that you are the author. Right? Send us the files. Show us how you do it.
00:27:38.812 - 00:28:00.078, Speaker C: No, no, no. And they send you a ticket, like the receipt from Shutterstock that they bought the art. And did they change the background? And you're like, this is not your art. And they're like, why? I bought it, like, for $40. But you don't own the commercial rights to exploit it, you know, commercially. Really? So they don't know. And this is just one case.
00:28:00.078 - 00:28:40.578, Speaker C: And the problem here is, you know, like, you have these people that think that they can go and just copy paste, literally copy paste things and then resell them. And yes, they come from a legitimate mint, but should they be verified? And now we are talking about thousands. Soon we will be talking about hundreds of thousands of kids of new people that are coming into the space. They don't know these rules. And we are enforcing these rules how? By manpower. You know, like, talking to them, sending files digitally that can only be also be faked. So it's kind of a big problem for the whole space, is, like, what verification really means.
00:28:40.578 - 00:28:51.762, Speaker C: And what do we enforce when we say this is verified or not verified? And now there's another example, and Jordan and I very well know this example. Rogue sharks. Okay.
00:28:51.818 - 00:28:52.074, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:52.114 - 00:28:55.414, Speaker C: So what happened? I'll tell you a story. What happened with rogue sharks?
00:28:55.754 - 00:28:59.922, Speaker A: 40 seconds, apparently. Okay, speedrun. Yes.
00:29:00.058 - 00:29:08.830, Speaker C: So Rogue sharks minted sharks. Right. But on their side, they said they gave away all the intellectual property for the sharks. Yes.
00:29:08.862 - 00:29:10.510, Speaker A: 100% gave it all away.
00:29:10.582 - 00:29:41.650, Speaker C: Yes. And then people came to Solsea because we are the only open marketplace on Solana still they minted fakes, what we call fakes. And then someone from Rogue shark community started, hey, they're selling fakes. They're selling fakes. But in the end of the game, I mean, we cannot know whether this is a real fake, I mean, save as fake or someone actually bought the shark has all the rights and minted hundreds of copies of this shark because he can do that because sharks gave away their intellectual property in their not even a contract.
00:29:41.722 - 00:29:43.242, Speaker A: But on the website FAQ. Yeah.
00:29:43.298 - 00:29:52.530, Speaker C: Yes. So there's a big, you know, like situation where we need to know what, what we are giving to the community and what we want back and so forth.
00:29:52.562 - 00:30:03.444, Speaker A: So that was, I think an excellent way to end it with this. We're ending the panel. Thank you all for coming up. This was a fantastic discussion. I thought so. We're out of applause.
