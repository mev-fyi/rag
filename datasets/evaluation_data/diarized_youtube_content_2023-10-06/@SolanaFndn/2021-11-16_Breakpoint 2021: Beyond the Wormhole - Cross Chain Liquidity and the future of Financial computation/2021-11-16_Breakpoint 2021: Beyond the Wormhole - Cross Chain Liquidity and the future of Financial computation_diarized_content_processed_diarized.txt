00:00:09.320 - 00:00:39.828, Speaker A: All right, how is everyone doing today? GM. Can I get a GM? GM? Yes. Also, wag me like it feels like we are going to make it. Massive kudos to the Solana team and all of the organizers. I have to say this is one of the most incredible events I've ever been to, and I'm really excited to be here with you. So today I have 20 minutes, and I thought that we could do something a little different. I'm going to take you on a little journey.
00:00:39.828 - 00:01:01.122, Speaker A: So I started my career in trading. I love market structure. So today I want to talk a little bit about market structure, how market structure works, and why crypto is so fucking cool in terms of its implications for market structure. So I hope you're ready. I hope you're excited. We're going to go fast. It's going to be weird, and hopefully we will all get something out of it.
00:01:01.122 - 00:01:15.306, Speaker A: So I wanted to talk about cross chain liquidity and the future of financial computation. So let's get started. My clicker is not working. Oh, there we go. It's working now. Amazing. So I have a disclaimer.
00:01:15.306 - 00:01:45.826, Speaker A: You can read it. Basically, none of this is financial advice, so note that. And I'll also note that my firm, Coinshares, is very active in the Solana ecosystem. Here are some of our investments and some of the things we're doing that we've publicly announced. But we're really excited as a market firm to build on top of Solana, to invest in the Solana ecosystem, and to work with all of you amazing people here. So what is liquidity? Who knows what liquidity is? All right, some people. Let's just walk through it.
00:01:45.826 - 00:02:22.266, Speaker A: So if anyone knows the movie Wall street, amazing Gordon Gekko quote about liquidity. And the quote is, I'm not talking about driving a fucking BMW. I'm talking about 5100 million dollars liquid. So if you've seen this movie, you know what liquidity is, and why does liquidity matter? So here's a little picture that sort of summarizes an order book. And basically what happens when you create a market. You have people who want to buy and people who want to sell, and where buyers and sellers match in terms of price and volume, that's where trades happen. That's called the volume of the market.
00:02:22.266 - 00:02:58.294, Speaker A: Right. And liquidity is really the trade off that you're taking between the price at which an asset can be sold and how quickly it can be sold. So if an asset's really liquid, it means the spread, meaning the difference between buyers and sellers is really tight, and you can sell a lot of assets really rapidly without losing value. In contrast, if an asset's liquid, selling it means that you're going to have to take a significant discount, typically. Or buying it means you're going to have to take a premium because the spread is really wide. So in traditional markets, speculators and market makers do this job of providing liquidity. That's why they're called market makers.
00:02:58.294 - 00:03:36.478, Speaker A: But in crypto, we're doing something totally different. So traditional financial markets are NGMIs not gonna make it, and here's why. If I own a bitcoin, right, or let's start with something simple. If I own an apple, and I give you an apple, I no longer have the apple and you have the apple. The problem arises when we move this to the digital world. If I have an idea, and I give you an idea, we both have two ideas. So the way that traditional financial markets work is we're literally copy pasting data entries in a database between a bunch of different markets and market venues.
00:03:36.478 - 00:04:26.290, Speaker A: And so what happens in this entire process is the existing traditional financial life cycle requires people in office building and skyscrapers around the world to sit around copy pasting data from one database to another and reconciling this copy pasting on a periodic basis to make sure someone didn't fuck up. It is not efficient, it's not easy to do, and it's super, super messy. So what is cryptocurrency? What is this crazy crypto thing? What are we doing with it? I want to shift your thinking about what crypto is. We're not going to talk about tech. We're going to talk, like, esoteric, high level idea. So I want to go back to bitcoin because that's where it all began for me. So money started with gold, really, right? Gold is a shiny rock.
00:04:26.290 - 00:05:03.738, Speaker A: Literally a shiny rock. But the shiny rock had universal value, and we could price it, and it was super liquid. A gram of gold that I could take with me was a gram of gold anywhere in the world. So we started with shiny rocks, and then we put shiny rocks into these piles, and we built cities around them, and then we built armies to protect our gold. And all of a sudden, we end up in the modern age where we have banks. And as I explained before, a lot of our banking and financial system is basically just massive databases, copy pasting entries between one another and making sure that that copy pasting is done correctly. And then we get to bitcoin.
00:05:03.738 - 00:05:39.106, Speaker A: Bitcoin is not a shiny rock. Bitcoin is not a bank. It is a way to move digital value without incurring the double spend problem, which is novel and profound for markets. And we'll get into why this matters for liquidity. And so bitcoin, basically, what bitcoin did is it turned computation into money, but secure money that cannot be double spent. And it also put a price on this financial computation. So the bitcoin network really is the world's first independent secure financial network.
00:05:39.106 - 00:06:24.534, Speaker A: And the demand for block space is a function of the demand for secure financial transactions. So think about that. Block space is a way of pricing the world's demand for secure financial computation. Then Ethereum came along, and Ethereum extended this idea by introducing financial computation. Instead of just providing secure settlement guarantees, bitcoin, Ethereum, pardon, provided secure financial computation in the form of smart contracts. And now there are all of these amazing l one protocols, and some of them you've heard from today. And we're all here because we love Solana, but they're all introducing different models for pricing financial computation by offering different types of security guarantees or opting for certain measures of centralization.
00:06:24.534 - 00:06:43.906, Speaker A: So what we're really doing with crypto is all about financial computation. Are you with me? So far, I see some people looking confused. Yes, we like it. She likes it. Okay, we're good. So block space is a scarce asset. We can see the demand for bitcoin block space is cyclical.
00:06:43.906 - 00:07:25.470, Speaker A: But the demand for Ethereum block space has been really interesting to observe because it's been persistent over time. The other thing that's really interesting is we can now actually price the demand for financial compute, making it a fungible, tradable asset. We're going there. Okay, so we look at bitcoin transaction fees, Ethereum transaction fees. We have a real live way of pricing supply and demand for financial computation. Where that settles is called your transaction fee. And so what I think is really interesting now, and I have another meme, because I love my memes, blockchain compute in and of itself, is becoming a fungible asset across chains.
00:07:25.470 - 00:08:04.080, Speaker A: So let me explain that for a moment. So I started my career as a commodities trader. Okay? For a commodity to be tradable, you need to be able to move it around to where it's needed in a cost effective manner. So if I have a barrel of oil, and someone in India needs a barrel of oil, me having a barrel of oil here in Portugal doesn't really help me, because my buyer in India can't physically access that barrel of oil. So we created a whole market around synthetic paper derivatives representing barrels of oil. So we could create a liquid, really deep market. And today, the paper market for commodities 30 times larger than the actually physically settled spot market.
00:08:04.080 - 00:08:52.178, Speaker A: So, for a commodity to be usable and tradable, it needs to be able to move around to where it's needed. Historically, we have not had the ability to move financial computation from one chain to another. But now we can do that. We have l, two s, we have bridging, we have compatible chains. And so what we've done is we've opened up the ability to make financial compute functions themselves, fungible and tradable. Prior to this, the effort and time that it would take to rebuild my application on a new chain would negate any financial savings on the cost of compute. But now I can easily migrate my application between the lowest cost chain in order to help me achieve the specific type of financial compute I need without needing to build new code.
00:08:52.178 - 00:09:06.870, Speaker A: This is actually really fucking cool and really exciting. Are you excited? Okay. Just me. Okay. All right. This is where Solana really shines. So this morning, I was sitting in my little hotel room, and I did two transactions.
00:09:06.870 - 00:09:20.362, Speaker A: I bought some go Fx. Goose. Fx. Let's go. I bought some go FX, about $1 worth. And you can look at the network fee I paid on Solana. It was teeny, teeny, teeny, teeny tiny.
00:09:20.362 - 00:09:39.498, Speaker A: It was less than 100th of a cent. And then I tried to do a one USDC buy on Ethereum, on Sushiswap. And for my $1 buy, I was going to pay $57 in fees. Like, that's fucked. So it's not going to work. NGMI. And I'm not dissing Ethereum.
00:09:39.498 - 00:10:07.394, Speaker A: Ethereum's amazing for specific things. But when we talk about people actually using crypto for financial compute, we need really low cost transactions, and we need the ability to be able to switch between different types of computational networks. So this is really exciting to me. So let's get to liquidity now. So we kind of talked about what liquidity is. We've talked about what crypto is at a high level and the need for fungible computation. But now let's get to liquidity.
00:10:07.394 - 00:11:09.806, Speaker A: So how do I make market depth and liquidity fungible super exciting? Well, I want to start by saying this is a really important disclaimer. There is no free lunch, right? We're trying to optimize for throughput. We're trying to optimize for speed, and we're trying to optimize for lowest cost. And in order to do these things, in order to achieve scalability and financial computation, we have to recognize that we're making inherent trade offs in regards to both decentralization and security. And if you've ever interacted with an l two bridge, let's say, for example, the Avalanche bridge, which has $5 billion of TVL on it, you know that all of that TVL is managed by a single SGX key, right? So there's some real risk there in smashing your assets into a bridge. So you are making trade offs, but those trade offs are required right now in order to facilitate the scalability that we want to see. So let's just go through sort of the history of what liquidity in crypto markets has looked like.
00:11:09.806 - 00:12:14.666, Speaker A: And what I think is really interesting that we don't talk about enough, is really the first innovation of cross chain liquidity was connecting tradfi with crypto finance. In 2013, bitcoin had a major problem. And the problem was, when I settle a bitcoin transaction with someone OTC, the bitcoin transaction settles with finality within ten minutes, within block time. But the cash side of the transaction takes two to three days to settle and has zero settlement guarantees. So how can I settle bitcoin transaction with a cash counterparty directly on chain? Well, they made something called tether, and tether was the first time that you could settle dollars against bitcoin directly on chain with the same settlement guarantees. And now stable coins make up $140 billion of market cap. But putting these dollars on chain has created also a massive, massive amount of liquidity that is developed completely outside of the traditional financial system, without any prime brokers, without any banks, and without any traditional credit providers.
00:12:14.666 - 00:12:44.828, Speaker A: It scares the shit out of banks, by the way, because it's absolutely incredible. The other thing that's really interesting is thinking about the utility of this liquidity. So the top three stable coins by market cap are tether, USDC, and BUSD on binance smart chain. But what's really interesting is, if you can see the little orange dots, the velocity of these is very different. Velocity is the amount of times that dollar is used in a day. In a transaction. The velocity of USDT is by far the highest.
00:12:44.828 - 00:13:14.306, Speaker A: USDT turns over about once a day, whereas USDC only turns over about once every ten days, meaning that people use it much less. So the sheer volume of stablecoin is impressive, but the velocity is not yet there. So then let's talk about the next innovation. So first, we put dollars on chain, which is super cool. Then we put bitcoin on Ethereum, which is also pretty wild. So today, fully 1.4% of bitcoin has actually been bridged over onto Ethereum.
00:13:14.306 - 00:13:45.758, Speaker A: So we have an asset that settles with finality, and we took it and we put it onto a chain that created the ability to have financial computation with that asset. So again, here, we've seen a tremendous amount of growth in the amount of bitcoin that's on Ethereum. But again, a lot of this bitcoin is fully custodial. It's managed by a third party who keeps that bitcoin in a vault. And one of the big areas I think we need to innovate in is making that bitcoin non custodial. So that was the second innovation. So we started with dollars, then we said, hey, we have this ethereum thing.
00:13:45.758 - 00:14:15.926, Speaker A: Let's put bitcoin on Ethereum. And then this summer, something incredible happened. L two, baby. L two happened. So there's currently $5 billion of Ethereum that is moving to l two because Ethereum's cost of financial compute is too damn high. And again, this is where it starts to get really interesting. This l two activity is currently dominated by arbitrum, which makes up about 60% of this volume.
00:14:15.926 - 00:14:46.654, Speaker A: And l two solutions are really interesting because they fully or partially derive their security from layer one, Ethereum. So you don't have to rely on the honesty of l two validators for the security of your funds, but you are relying on a wide mix of platforms and applications that allow you to bridge into l two. So l two is growing. And my view of the future is this. In the future, all assets will become fungible across all chains. And here is why. Because the function we're optimizing for is the cost of financial computation.
00:14:46.654 - 00:15:27.104, Speaker A: To date, $25 billion in total value has been bridged away from l one in a variety of different assets, and 20 billion of that has taken place in the last 30 days. Over 90,000 unique addresses have bridged away. This is not limited to a small set of users. Like this is happening en masse, at scale, because, again, liquidity seeks to go to the broadest market. And in order to build liquidity, in order to get more users in, we need to find the lowest cost of computation across blockchains. At the end of the day, I don't care what network my transaction settles on. I care that it settles with finality and at the lowest cost possible.
00:15:27.104 - 00:15:57.562, Speaker A: So as more and more bridges get built, I think we'll see volumes grow. Users are going to seek speed, ease of use, and availability of financial computation. And what's really a challenge to the Solana community here is if we look at these assets being bridged away, less than 1% of them are going through Solana wormhole. Who's using wormhole today? Anyone? Wormhole users? A couple. All right. I moved some money around on wormhole this morning. It's pretty good.
00:15:57.562 - 00:16:31.624, Speaker A: So it'll be interesting to see how, over time, this pie chart continues to change. When I made this chart about a month and a half ago, Ronin Bridge wasn't even on here. And today, Ronin Bridge, which is a flow blockchain bridge, is about a third of this chart. So these l two s can get really popular really fast, especially if there are a lot of users using them. So challenge to all of us in this room is how do we increase the amount of volume going through Solana wormhole? I'm gonna work on that. Hopefully, you guys take that challenge away as well. And ultimately, this is where we're getting to.
00:16:31.624 - 00:17:01.648, Speaker A: In the future, all assets will become fungible across all chains. Today, as of this week, crypto is a $3 trillion asset class. Let's break down where those assets live. About $135 billion of that market is stable coins. That's about 5% of the total crypto market. That's cash that we've made liquid and fungible in the crypto ecosystem. So we took something out of trad five, shoved it into crypto, and it's now 5% of the market cap.
00:17:01.648 - 00:17:29.695, Speaker A: About 1% is wrapped assets, meaning assets that we've moved to chains where the cost of financial computation is lower. About 25 billion is in l two s and bridges. Again, these are assets seeking financial compute at lower cost. And about $7 billion is in liquid staking derivatives. And I don't have time to talk about liquid staking derivatives today, but if you're working on liquid staking derivatives, please come and find me. I would love to chat with you about it. And here's my point.
00:17:29.695 - 00:18:22.200, Speaker A: The demand for blockchain based financial compute will continue to exceed the available supply of financial compute for some time to come. What am I saying? Block space in every blockchain is incredibly valuable. And the minute that cheap block space becomes available, people will build products and services to fill up all of those blocks with their computation. And what's really cool is, as this asset class grows, so will the migration of assets across various protocols as users and devs alike find new ways to leverage cheaper, faster financial computation. So, at the end of the day, this is not a money story. This is a compute story, which is super exciting, okay? And here's why this is exciting to me, and this is really the point of, like, my very long winded bullshit. Anyone can be a market maker.
00:18:22.200 - 00:18:47.556, Speaker A: So liquidity 1.0 was boomers in blazers, Citadel, KCG flow traders, virtu. Being a market maker in the tradfi world requires a significant amount of money and adequate regulatory capital. And because market microstructure varies by your asset type, each firm tends to specialize in a very specific market. Some firms are commodities market makers. Some firms are effects market makers. Some market make in equities.
00:18:47.556 - 00:19:09.756, Speaker A: And firms gain edge through proprietary order flow, their technology and infrastructure and their relationships. That's the old world. We are going to kill that world, and we're going to build a new world. Liquidity 2.0 is about degenerate apes like us. Djens shall inherit the earth. And here's why.
00:19:09.756 - 00:20:02.154, Speaker A: Literally anyone who holds a crypto asset has a risk appetite, can be a market maker today. Whether you have a dollar, 100, or $100 million, anyone can be a market maker via liquidity pools and amms or automated market makers. And because all assets settle with finality to the network, liquidity is hyper fluid and can migrate really quickly to capture these juicy yields that we see. And the best part of all of this is the way you gain edge in this new world is through your market intelligence, your speed, and your risk tolerance. Not relationships, not how fat your stock is, not how rich you are, not how smart you are. It's all about being in the market and having risk appetite. And even cooler yet is, in a lot of instances, scale can actually hinder your edge.
00:20:02.154 - 00:20:22.288, Speaker A: Meaning too big means you can't achieve as high of a return. So it will start to favor smaller and smaller traders and individuals, which is really exciting. And this is just the beginning. So let's think about how big financial markets really are. Crypto, $3 trillion. Precious metal. Literally rocks like fucking rocks.
00:20:22.288 - 00:20:30.968, Speaker A: $12 trillion market. Real estate. $30 trillion market. The m two money supply. 40 trillion. Global equities. 106 trillion.
00:20:30.968 - 00:21:01.320, Speaker A: So we're starting in our little $3 trillion market. But I believe that by the end of this decade, all of these markets will operate 24, 7365 globally in one giant market called crypto. Crypto is a motherfucking black hole that is going to absorb every market in the world. Super exciting. And so let's build this future together. Let's put the fun in financial computation. Thank you for listening.
00:21:01.320 - 00:21:09.104, Speaker A: If you're working on anything related to this. My email, my Twitter handle, Opendoor would love to meet all of you, and thank you so much for your time. Bye.
