00:00:00.280 - 00:00:50.224, Speaker A: Hey everyone, we are at the Solanapay merch store at the Atlas cafe and we want to demo a new feature in the Solanapay protocol called transaction requests. What transaction requests do is enable any NFT to act as a loyalty token. And as you can see here, I've got my Atlas cafe NFT and it's more than just a pretty profile pic. This Atlas cafe NFT will serve as a 20% discount for all future Solana pay transactions at Atlas Cafe. So let's say I want to buy four T shirts. Each of the T shirts is twenty five cents and I want to check out it's a dollar. So I'm going to scan the Solana pay QR code and you can see I've instantly got a 20% discount applied from the Atlas cafe NFT and I can make the payment.
00:00:50.224 - 00:01:06.714, Speaker A: And what you'll see is when the transaction is complete, I will have paid for my T shirts, but I'll have gotten them for $0.88. Transactions complete on the Pos NFT loyalty in a box.
