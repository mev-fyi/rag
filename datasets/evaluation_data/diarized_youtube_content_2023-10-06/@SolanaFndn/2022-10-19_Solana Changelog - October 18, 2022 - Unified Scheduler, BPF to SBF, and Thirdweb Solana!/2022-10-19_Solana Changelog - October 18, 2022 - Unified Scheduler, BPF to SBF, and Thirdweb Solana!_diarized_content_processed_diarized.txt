00:00:00.560 - 00:00:05.110, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Changelog. I'm Joe, this is Jacob, and we're going to bring you guys the changes.
00:00:05.142 - 00:00:06.878, Speaker B: For last week from Solana.
00:00:07.006 - 00:00:15.150, Speaker A: So, to start, we have another proposal. As usual, this one's kind of like in draft phase. What do you see on that one, Jacob?
00:00:15.342 - 00:01:09.394, Speaker C: Yes, there is a draft proposal for a unified scheduler on Solana. So, like today, transactions are kind of scheduled. There's some issues. Like, for example, right now, most of the leaders are more incentivized to pack transactions into a block, to not create any idling time for block time, versus, like, not create empty space in a block, which we want to fill those blocks, to be honest, not be careful about latency and opportunity costs. So there are some changes are being proposed for having some type of unified scheduler that will make it easier for transactions to actually be scheduled and blocks to be packed bigger. So definitely check out that proposal if you're interested, to learn more and then what commits have you seen this past week?
00:01:10.774 - 00:01:13.206, Speaker A: Yeah, so I saw a little bit.
00:01:13.230 - 00:01:16.830, Speaker B: More work on migrating from BPF to SPF.
00:01:16.942 - 00:01:25.632, Speaker A: So Berkeley packet filter BPF, that's what we started out using on Solana. That's what everyone's kind of familiar with. And there's actually a new implementation that.
00:01:25.688 - 00:01:29.248, Speaker B: Has been around for a little while, the Solana binary format.
00:01:29.416 - 00:01:32.736, Speaker A: And, like, engineers really want you guys to be using SPF.
00:01:32.800 - 00:01:34.096, Speaker B: So, like, more and more changes are.
00:01:34.120 - 00:01:35.576, Speaker A: Happening to a lot of the source.
00:01:35.720 - 00:01:37.456, Speaker B: And you'll notice if you try to.
00:01:37.480 - 00:01:45.384, Speaker A: Use BPF, you'll get a little, like, deprecated warning. So if whenever you upgrade your CLI or things like that, like, try to get up to SPF and use that.
00:01:45.424 - 00:01:47.764, Speaker B: Just switch it in your build command.
00:01:48.224 - 00:01:51.016, Speaker A: And then I also saw. Oh, sorry, go ahead.
00:01:51.080 - 00:01:57.584, Speaker C: Specifically build command that you usually run. Like, what does it look like and what should, what exactly does it change to?
00:01:58.124 - 00:02:03.852, Speaker A: Yeah, so you typically will run cargo build BPF, and all you have to.
00:02:03.868 - 00:02:06.108, Speaker B: Do is change it to cargo build SPF.
00:02:06.236 - 00:02:11.684, Speaker A: And then, like, there's additional flags that people use sometimes, like, manifest path output directory.
00:02:11.724 - 00:02:13.356, Speaker B: I think those are all relatively the.
00:02:13.380 - 00:02:18.106, Speaker A: Same, but you can always just slap help and, like, you'll be able to see what the differences there are.
00:02:18.300 - 00:02:19.314, Speaker C: All right, cool.
00:02:20.054 - 00:02:36.314, Speaker A: Yeah. And then the only other commit that I really saw was a little bit more support on the connection object for Solana Web three j's. There's a git parsed block method now, so it'll give you a JSON parsed object back for a block. So pretty cool.
00:02:36.814 - 00:02:38.674, Speaker B: How about you? What commits did you see?
00:02:39.054 - 00:03:24.094, Speaker C: I saw some things on the Explorer changes. So there's more support for displaying closed program accounts now. So previously if a program was closed, it just looked like an account via the explorer, not giving you the information that it was actually a closed program. So that is a change. They're also adding support for like the close instruction as well as the extend program instruction, which is very exciting in the future on the Explorer so that you can see those transactions. And for on that note, like whenever you make a program or deploy a program onto Solana, you usually use the upgradeable BPF loader. Right now, the old one, which is deprecated, is actually being removed.
00:03:24.094 - 00:03:43.824, Speaker C: It's currently being, I believe it's currently removed from Testnet. So definitely be on the watch for that. If you're using the old one for some reason, the deprecated one, definitely upgrade to the upgradable loader today. And what resources have you seen this past week, Joe?
00:03:45.124 - 00:03:47.932, Speaker B: Yeah, so recently, I think maybe last.
00:03:47.988 - 00:03:56.548, Speaker A: Week or so, maybe two weeks ago, third web added support for Solana, and they released their information about that. So third web is kind of like.
00:03:56.716 - 00:03:59.500, Speaker B: A composability SDK provider.
00:03:59.532 - 00:04:27.194, Speaker A: So they build a lot of really cool SDKs to sort of like simplify a lot of your development practices. So one example is they have like, it's like a three liner to get like an NFT collection bag, and you just kind of provide like a public key or whatever. You know, it's real simple. So they have a lot of cool solutions like that. And they just introduced, obviously, Solana support. So there's going to be some interesting stuff you could do on Solana with third web. So take a look at that and we hope to see more from them in the future.
00:04:27.894 - 00:04:43.024, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah. Looking forward to seeing other tools that make life easier to build on Solana. On that note, thank you for listening to today's changelog, where we go over the week by week changes on Solana. We'll see you next week.
