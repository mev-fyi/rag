00:00:02.280 - 00:00:18.686, Speaker A: Hello, hello, hello. Well, thank you very much, Amira. It's always fun to hear about my previous life at Trainline. Today, I'm not here to talk about trainline. I'm here to talk about Ledger and security, actually. Quick poll. Everyone who knows Ledger in the room.
00:00:18.686 - 00:00:55.096, Speaker A: So pretty much everyone. Cool. And who owns the ledger, and that's 90% of people in the room. All right, cool. So ledger is a security company, and our mission is really to secure web3. I think where we're starting from is the challenge that you're seeing on the screen behind me right now is that the web two technology that we have, our phones, our tablets, they're amazing to create, share, and consume information, but they just don't really cut it to actually manage and store value. And that's not me saying it.
00:00:55.096 - 00:01:29.834, Speaker A: It's just that we see hack after hack, year after year. In fact, in 2021, about $14 billion worth of digital assets got stolen. That's how bad it is. And so the world needs security because the world needs self custody, and self custody without security can't exist. So that's what we set off to do. And our answer to this is actually building a new generation of technology, software, and hardware to secure your private keys. But not only, and this is what we're going to talk today about.
00:01:29.834 - 00:02:21.750, Speaker A: Quick side note as well, probably one of the best kept secret in web3 right now is that what we're doing for consumers, we're also doing it for enterprises. And so we're also doing that for institutions with Ledger enterprise. But back to a solution. The main revolution that Ledger introduced is our hardware wallet ledger Nano S plus X. The S was the first one started in 2016. And the idea is that we have this secure element, that chip that stores your private keys. And unlike what we're seeing out there, and we use will first, is that we build an operating system in that secure element which stores your private keys, and your private keys never leave that secure element.
00:02:21.750 - 00:03:08.134, Speaker A: The cryptography and the computation all happens on there. Moreover, that secure element and that OS on there actually knows how to run different applications and also controls the screen and the buttons that you're seeing out there. And this creates a trusted display, which is also a key element of our offering. So that when you're trading and managing your portfolio with your apps or your laptop, you can actually verify on your device what's shown to you on screen. So that if that application says that you're actually sending your crypto to this address, well, you can verify that on the trusted display controlled by the secure element, that this is actually the case. What you see is what you sign. So that's the hardware layer.
00:03:08.134 - 00:03:43.380, Speaker A: And what we're doing in this hardware layer, we're not doing only for Ledger, it's multi chain, but it's also multi wallet. So you can use that with Soulflare, with Coinbase wallet or metamask as well. And obviously we provide our own software wallet on top of it, which is Ledger live. It's a 4.9 star app in the App Store and allows you to send and receive and buy, exchange, stake, crypto and offer you all what web3 can offer to you. So that's the base of the offering. A brand new product and a new tier is Ledger connect.
00:03:43.380 - 00:04:45.266, Speaker A: I think quick poll again, who here interacts pretty frequently with smart contracts, whether it's DeFi or NFTs, about half the room. So this is interesting to you because we're securing the private keys thanks to our hardware and software wallet, but you only have secure as the smart contract that you're interacting with. If that smart contract is built to drain your wallet, the minute you sign that transaction, the minute you sign that message and you give access that smart contract to your wallet, that is going to drain your wallet. And so that's what Ledger connect is all about. Each time you're interacting with a smart contract, it's kind of like having unsafe sex from that perspective, which is like it's fine until it's not. And so vegic connect is pretty much the digital condom so that you can actually interact with the smart contracts. It adds that layer with a functionality that we call web3 checks, which picks up signals and shows them to you.
00:04:45.266 - 00:05:20.034, Speaker A: Like how risky it is to interact with the smart contract. You also have predicted impacts. So we actually simulate what you're going to do and we show that to you. So normally you give a bit of crypto, you get an NFT, but if it's a fraudulent smart contract, it's going to drain you and you're going to see it and you can reject the transaction before it actually happens. It's the web3, safe sex basically. And I think the key news is Solana is a first class citizen in the entire ledger stack. It will be supported on day one on Ledger Connect.
00:05:20.034 - 00:06:11.134, Speaker A: It is already supported in Ledger Live. You can send and receive and stake sold within that wallet and it obviously is supported on our hardware wallets, whether this is with Ledger live or other wallets of your choice. The big news, you've heard about it on Saturday Emmett presented it. Part of the Solana mobile announcements is that we are obviously working with Solana Mobile to bring Ledger live to the saga and bring the ledger ecosystem and ledger security that goes along with it to saga. So more on this very soon. We're actually working with the Solana mobile team on that part. And last but not least is all the things that I've told you about.
00:06:11.134 - 00:06:42.410, Speaker A: This entire ledger stack is entirely open. It's open source. You can build your own nano app to run on that secure element in our devices. You can integrate your protocol, you can integrate live apps on top of Ledger Live, and you can also integrate ledger technology within your dapps. And this is also true for institutions. All that technology is available to you as well. So if you want to build, all the information is available online on developers dot Ledger.com
00:06:42.410 - 00:07:04.472, Speaker A: dot we welcome everyone, every project. Please reach out. It all starts on that website. We got a discover discord server to help out and we'll help you out in your developments. That's pretty much it for me. If you want to learn more, hit us up online. Follow our twitter.
00:07:04.472 - 00:07:19.974, Speaker A: You can hit me online as well and I'll also hang around during the during the event. Feel free to grab me if you want to talk about building on Ledger, about Ledger Connect or the saga. Thank you very much.
