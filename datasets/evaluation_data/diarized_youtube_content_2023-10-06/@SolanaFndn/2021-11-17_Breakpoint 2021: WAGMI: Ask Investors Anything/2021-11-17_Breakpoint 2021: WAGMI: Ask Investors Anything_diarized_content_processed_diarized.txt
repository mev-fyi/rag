00:00:18.400 - 00:00:49.434, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. Welcome, family. Wag me familia. Wag me familia. You know, I gotta say, wag me is it's got to be the best meme going these days, right? I mean, nothing feels better than saying to your collective tribe that you're going to make it, especially in these tough times. Now, the context of this and a bit of housekeeping first, everyone, a bit of housekeeping. Before we get into it, this was originally intended to give you all a chance in the audience to ask folks directly a question.
00:00:49.434 - 00:01:15.594, Speaker A: That's why we have so many of these great dawn patrol early people in Solana here. With the way the room is set up and with some of the sound, we don't think it's going to be the best experience. So this is what we're going to offer you as the type of compensation for that. At the end of this session, we've got some good questions. I think I'm going to mind read you and get some of the stuff you want to hear up. This is all about what's interesting, but all these gentlemen are going to be over there at the end of this session. If you want to do any one on one, ask them a question.
00:01:15.594 - 00:01:49.008, Speaker A: I've asked them all to make themselves a little bit available after this, so don't feel shy to rush them after this. All right, so we're gonna jump in. Wag me, everyone. Wag me. Now, I mentioned this in a panel we did earlier, but it's sort of the way I want to frame it for everyone. So, as anyone knows, if you were in bitcoin early, if you were in Ethereum early, the idea of going to meetups and the meetup culture was really the rocket boosters of everything we've done in this industry. Right? You know, I was in Toronto for the early Ethereum days.
00:01:49.008 - 00:02:21.244, Speaker A: The energy around that was just great, and it made you addictive and wanted you to go back all the time now. And I remember getting Linda G. One of the original coin based mafia folks who spun out her own vc already in 2017, to come to New York and tell everyone what she did, to tell the established New York City VC's how this new generation was handling everything. And what she said is, I go to meetups. I don't read any of the literature. I mean, what are you guys talking about? You know, fundamental analysis. You got to meet the people and you got to hear what they're trying to build, and you got to figure it out like that.
00:02:21.244 - 00:02:57.994, Speaker A: So the meetup culture was behind this, and all these folks here have been able to be part of this ecosystem without the benefit of what we've only known until now. So we're going to start with talking about how you came. Now, Chris in the middle here is going to start because his answer is easy. He was before any of us into Solana. So we're going to get him to talk a little bit about how he came to it, how he saw the opportunity beyond the meetup culture, and then we're going to move around to hear other people's strategies. It's about strategy, right? How do these folks strategize and get to these good opportunities? So, Chris early, let us know how you came to it.
00:02:58.454 - 00:03:22.102, Speaker B: Hey, everybody. My name is Chris McCann. I'm one of the general partners at Race Capital, and I was one of the earliest seed investors of Solana itself when Anatoly and Raj were first starting the project, we actually met him through a good friend of ours, my partner, Edith. We have a friend of ours named David Kwek, who also might be here, too. He was underwater. Underwater hockey player with Anatoly. They played together.
00:03:22.102 - 00:03:23.302, Speaker B: I don't know if that's a no.
00:03:23.318 - 00:03:25.166, Speaker A: I never knew about the underwater hockey thing.
00:03:25.310 - 00:03:50.718, Speaker B: I don't know if that's a. But it's a known thing. But they were good friends for a long time, and David was like, hey, you got to talk to Anatoly about this next thing that he's starting. And so Anatoly had this crazy concept for how to scale blockchains by using time to append transactions on a ledger, kind of what would become this concept of proof of history. But he was very clear at the time, there was no code written. There was no testnet. There was nothing built.
00:03:50.718 - 00:04:27.920, Speaker B: There was literally nothing. This is a pure concept in Anatoly's head, and he wasn't sure if this was going to work. And so the initial seed round was basically to fund the development, to see if this could be built. But Anatolihia was a former developer at Qualcomm, a very low level systems engineering. And my partner Edith, background checked him with his boss and his other coworkers at Qualcomm, and they all said, what is Anatoly working on? I'm going to join him. And that was more than enough, like, proof for us that anatoly was somebody worth backing. And so that's how we originally got involved.
00:04:27.952 - 00:04:53.606, Speaker A: I do want to interject and get you guys to clap at this fella here and his partners who went through this job, because to do that work with a guy who is playing underwater hockey means you have a bit of vision, right. And I think it's important to underline. So the underwater hockey led you to believe that this thing was worth experimenting on, that it was worthy of seeing if it worked, that proof of history was something you need to see the light of day and that you could build off of it.
00:04:53.670 - 00:04:53.990, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:54.062 - 00:05:22.176, Speaker B: To your point, like, when you're looking at things in the earliest stages, it's usually all about the people. And so, honestly, we just fell in love with Anatoly and Raj and all the team members that came together and we believed in and wanted to support in what they were doing. And I've always tried to be as supportive as possible to anybody building anything in the Solana ecosystem, any founder, anybody building anything new. I'm happy to spend time, I'm happy to help. I just have a lot of love for people in this community and ecosystem.
00:05:22.320 - 00:06:07.698, Speaker A: So when you say it's about the person, I'm going to take that as the bridge to the next question here. I'm going to go with Amos. And Amos actually just told me before this that he was actually roommates with Vitalik as he was launching the white paper all those years ago for a short period in Toronto. And this idea that, you know, and I think that's the context here, right? It's the people you're investing in. So what happens if you're in lockdown because of a global pandemic and you can't actually meet the people anymore, right? You can't just have a sense of them, who they are. You know, Amos, you are from that world of early bitcoin meetups, the early Ethereum meetups. You are with these people, it was easy for you to see who was real, who was worth an investment, who was worth backing.
00:06:07.698 - 00:06:11.050, Speaker A: How did you make do for Solana and how did you get around it?
00:06:11.122 - 00:07:03.146, Speaker D: Yeah, so very interesting. So I built originally colored coins, which was the first protocol on top of bitcoin early on. And to me, I remember seeing an article about Ethereum, that saying, all the cool kids are building on Ethereum. You remember that? That was in Techcrunch. You remember that, right? And to me, I go where the developers go. Okay, so it's all about the developers community, right? So I saw that wave going, like from bitcoin, the L2 colored coins, counterparty, those old protocols on top of bitcoin, into Ethereum. And once I started seeing people, not people, but developers, you know, actual builders, going into the solar land ecosystem, that was when? Like a year and a half ago or something like that, I kind of like, got interested in understanding.
00:07:03.146 - 00:07:10.814, Speaker D: Okay, what's going on? Why do people go there, why developers are going there? And this is where I really took the deep dive into the ecosystem.
00:07:12.154 - 00:07:47.034, Speaker A: So that question, I'm going to go with you next, Bec, who is from one of these great projects that's looking at, you know, korean activity, Silicon Valley, all across America. So what I'm hearing is you look at the developers, you see the energy of the developers going in one direction. And of course, you guys, as I understand, have actually even funded some hacker houses and development stuff in Korea to make sure you know where these people are and you can see what they're up to. Right. Is that an approach that you've taken further without this meetup culture? Go find out what the developers are saying. Tap them for information.
00:07:47.614 - 00:08:27.712, Speaker E: Yes. Before hash launch, as a fun, we were actually, our name came from Hash Lounge, which was a community building meetup. We did that in some of the co working spaces in Seoul where we brought Vitalik. Anatoly was also there. Just a lot of these early industry defining founders visiting Asia. We were hosting them and it was interesting in 1617 where if you're interested in crypto, you see a lot of content, Internet, but you always want to share and discuss your questions and see what people are building and learn from them. And it's hard to find them in early days.
00:08:27.712 - 00:08:51.112, Speaker E: Right. And we wanted to provide space and have a more of an educational, very close knit Q and a session. And that's how we started with kind of initial investments. Like, a lot of our investments actually came from those seminars that we did and we were like, oh, wow, that guy. The pitch and the presenter is so awesome. We also want to learn more. And then we ended up becoming ambassador and then start helping them out.
00:08:51.248 - 00:09:24.404, Speaker A: So for me, when you're doing those, you know, let's call it, it's not incubation, but you're working closely. How do you prioritize the work they're doing and what it is for you that will trigger you to be interested in funding it more or proceeding further? So what I mean is, do you have a list of priorities that you want to see come through? Why is one more important than the other? And how do you order those things when you're in contact with one of these developers?
00:09:24.944 - 00:10:17.164, Speaker E: Yeah, we definitely have a lot of lists that we try to look at the team and the project in many angles, but I think it really comes down to whether this team is the one that can execute that to get to the goal. And I think it's similar to how Chris was mentioning on reference, checking on the founders and just learning about how they've been executed, executing before. And yes, Solana was such an ambitious project that wasn't done before, but if you have the trust that this team will execute, that's when you get conviction that maybe these are some of the scenarios that we can take. And if these scenarios go, these are maybe how we can be helpful in that journey. So when we see that alignment we are in, but sometimes it's hard to see where this can go, and we try to find best ways that we can add value.
00:10:17.324 - 00:11:15.262, Speaker A: So when you're looking for best ways to add value in seeing it, I'm going to move to chase, because chase at Binance Labs has a lot of the avenues already available in the stack that Binance smart chain has and all of the work that binance labs does around that. So there's pieces that you guys can actually even say, well, we can help you fill in this block here, we can help you fill in this missing piece here. And when I look at Binance Labs, I see this piece, the token issuing the crowd funding the project launch platform that I've heard about for a while that I see the work going into constructing. Is that really a strategy for you guys to look at this new, look at literally the entire stack that Binance is, has built as all of it, an opportunity to help ecosystem folks and help projects grow, right?
00:11:15.398 - 00:11:50.568, Speaker F: Yeah. So I guess at Binance labs, we always hope to add as much value as possible. And there's many ways we can do that. We have a portfolio of about 90 companies in all different areas. If you want to have, say, a security audit, we can help you reach out to certic. If you want to talk to, say, layer one, L2, we basically help to incubate polygon Matic and can introduce you to some of those guys as well. And in terms of the whole ecosystem, we try to create value in the whole chain, like you said.
00:11:50.568 - 00:12:49.172, Speaker F: So we do have a launchpad launch pool product which can help you set up your project and list on Binance after and for launch pool. It's more for later stage projects that want to have some sort of staking program on Binance and reach out to more users. And on top of that, we also have the Binance smart chain, which is one of the most transacted smart chain in this space right now. And we hope to incubate early stage projects to get onto the whole ecosystem. And from Binance lab itself, we are also running the incubation program. So for that we are looking at chain agnostic projects, be it binance, smart chain, Ethereum and Solana, it doesn't really matter. We just want to look for the best teams and help them grow through our ecosystem.
00:12:49.268 - 00:13:02.000, Speaker A: But along that growth, you've almost. It almost looks like you have a roadmap to gamify it, for lack of a better word, where you can almost graduate the issuer's abilities along your entire stack. Is that a way you look at it?
00:13:02.072 - 00:13:18.920, Speaker F: Right. Right. So we want to help. We want to help projects, we want to help founders at every step in the process, from zero to one, one to 1010 to 100. So that's the idea behind it. And we really want to build a whole ecosystem that's supports them throughout the journey.
00:13:19.112 - 00:14:30.700, Speaker A: So a lot of it based, let's say, on a prediction that there's going to be millions more issuers in the world and that the product of issuance itself is worth building so that you can meet all these folks. So, and I want to take that, let's say, prediction that issuance is going to grow and it's going to become democratized and everyone's going to do it. And I want to go and ask the Sequoia capital member here, just because Sequoia Capital comes from, let's call it what it is, the old days, right? The old days when the best you could do was write a check and give some moral support and give a good beat down when they didn't come through. So when you hear all this stuff that they're building tech stacks, that they're going into living with developers, you know, getting to know the developers and everything they're doing, treating the developers themselves as the issuers they are, you know, how does Sequoia see this changing environment? And how do you predict going forward, who your audience is? Insofar as everyone's an issuer, everyone's an investor, right? How do you square that circle? No, no.
00:14:30.732 - 00:14:42.412, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you for that. Just a quick background before I answer that question very nicely. My name is Amit Jain. I'm a managing director with Sequoia Capital in Singapore. Sequoia. We invest across the world.
00:14:42.412 - 00:15:42.604, Speaker C: We have about 40 billion in assets under management. We'll invest anything from a million dollar check size to a few hundred million dollar check size. I would counter the fact that we are old, we are very active in the new world at Sequoia, India, and Singapore itself we've made about 20 investments. So in the last six months we are very happy investors with Sam and FTX and what many folks don't realize is with companies like and our portfolio companies like Stripe and Square and Robin Hood, we're very deep in the crypto ecosystem, although that doesn't come up as the front of web3 when we talk about it. So very, very bullish. The fact that we're here is the fact that we are doing what it takes to build and learn something that we may not have been the first at are very happy to admit that, but very bullish about where this is. Our focus is identifying the right trends and then building enduring companies.
00:15:42.604 - 00:16:23.744, Speaker C: We are not in it for a year or two years or three years. What we are here for is building enduring companies. And what that means is can we partner with somebody where companies are around for 10, 20, 30 years and you compound year over year because you have a product that is the best in the market. You have customer NP's and retention that's the best in the market. And can you build enduring companies? And I think as we go through this ecosystem of very rapid growth, which is absolutely amazing, the next phase of this will be how do you make those companies sustainable and enduring for the next 30 years. And that's where we partner with companies for a very, very long term.
00:16:23.924 - 00:17:04.044, Speaker A: Yeah, the square crypto and stripe one is very interesting. I see the purchase of title, for example, as a tremendous way to merge creator economy and cryptocurrencies in DeFi. But I want to continue on the question about predictions because you said long term investments and that's why I bring up the title piece. What if there's an opportunity for short term investments, Daos, and I don't mean turn a quick buck, I mean systematically find people that can turn a business from zero to one. But then that's the end. That's it. Right? So not everything has to be 30 years, right.
00:17:04.044 - 00:17:28.614, Speaker A: And I think there's folks here that invest in things that say, well, maybe this is only a seasonal, this is Solana season, right. This is good for now. It'll return and we'll grow on top of it later. A lot of daos think that way, right? Companies to be created and shut down. So is it only long term? Is there a way to think of the short term, not the quick buck, but the short term investments, short term products that might not be around forever?
00:17:29.154 - 00:18:19.984, Speaker C: Look again. I mean, we are flexible in terms of long term or short term, but the ideological has to be, you know, what is it that we are doing that is fundamentally different? What is it that we are doing that is solving a customer pain point? What is it that we are doing that is a painkiller and not a vitamin? What is it that we are doing that is loved by consumers across the world? Look, we help the daring build enduring companies. So we are not here to say we will invest for six months and flip the very fact. And one of the big changes that you might have heard about is the sequoia fund. Our objective is even to change the traditional vc model and say we are not a ten year fund. But how do you do something that is enduring in long term? Now, what that long term is might vary by the stage of the company or type, but we are here to partner with entrepreneurs for as long as they need us.
00:18:20.444 - 00:19:00.944, Speaker A: Great. So the prediction remains, this is going to work long term as an entire reorchestration, recalibration of how people have consent and show to agree to some form of contract in the digital world. Right? So the prediction is this is going to work. Now, I want to move from predictions that are going to work to predictions that are going to surprise. And I'm going to ask Ian, do you use predictions to help guide your overall framework? And do you have a particular prediction that you think sets your own systems and strategies apart from others?
00:19:01.244 - 00:20:20.400, Speaker G: Yeah, it's a super good question. And maybe that even gets into why we were early supporters of Solana serum ecosystem, essentially mass appeal applications, right? So when you're sitting in 2017 or 2018 or 2019 and you're working on, you know, some of the chains there, and you're running into limitations, TPS, finality, time, cost or whatnot, then you are looking at where you, what chain or what ecosystem removes these limitations. So that's kind of why we came to the Solana ecosystem in the first place. We were like, wow, if you can remove some of the limitations of some of the other l one s out there now, you can build your primitives differently, right? Your borrow your stablecoins, your liquidity pools or whatnot, you're opening up a lot of design space. Now, what can you do with that extra design space? Okay, well, now, when projects on top of that design space essentially composed with it, you have effective even opening up additional design space on top of that. After that, essentially you're making differentiated products that aren't available elsewhere. So when I talk about, like, how a primitive is built differently, I think to some extent that's like serum, right? So you had amms, or passive liquidity, if you will, on Ethereum.
00:20:20.400 - 00:20:46.518, Speaker G: And now you have active liquidity where people putting limit, limit orders on the book, and you have a central limit order book that's now allowing the second stage of innovation to happen. You know, like, Iran's a good example of this, right? I think they settle, like, half their trades through their internal amm. Half their trades go to, like, the CRM order book and things like that. Yeah. So that's kind of how we, how we make predictions. One of our big predictions was just, look, we need mass appeal applications.
00:20:46.566 - 00:20:46.702, Speaker A: Now.
00:20:46.718 - 00:21:11.336, Speaker G: Where do I think this is going to lead to? Now, I have not checked the TVL in Solana in the last few days, but I would say something like 100 billion TVL in the next year is reasonable, because I think you have a cycle that's working right now. You have differentiated products, you're getting users, you're getting TVL, you're getting investment, you're getting institutions, and then you're just starting this loop over again.
00:21:11.480 - 00:21:49.284, Speaker A: And when you say mass appeal, and then you also mentioned, let's call it, what was it again? So, mass appeal, you get the users if you get to a billion users. And the word I was looking for was design space. The design space for me, when I see a billion active users a day, that's still like a prize in this industry. No one's near a billion active users a day. We haven't developed anything. We don't have a billion users a day. But to me, when I see design space and I see a billion users a day, and they come together, right.
00:21:49.284 - 00:22:17.504, Speaker A: All of a sudden, there's a blue, like a blueprint. Right. A way to see going forward. Now, I wonder, John, you know, you see a billion users a day for you, if you were to predict what would happen to a billion users a day, or with a billion users a day, how would you start thinking about allocation? How would you start thinking about what you're going to look at next? So what I'm saying is, what if Solana works perfectly? What are you going to invest in next?
00:22:18.524 - 00:22:47.726, Speaker H: Sure. So that's Solana users. So I think for us, what we've. So we had the privilege and the challenge of working with Solana very early on, before it was perfect. But I mean, looking forward now, I think it's. For me, it's now that Solana has already reached this stage where it's at compared to 20 20, 20 19, 20 18, when Chris got in is like what users consider Solana as their home. Base.
00:22:47.726 - 00:23:24.098, Speaker H: So a lot of us coming through 2017, right, the home base was, whether it was coinbase or Bittrex or Binance or. Now it's, you know, a lot of us, I think, still retain as ethereum as our home base. But the next billion users, like, could Solana be their home base? So, you know, one of our analysts, like, the first crypto she ever bought now is Solana. It's not bitcoin, it's not ethereum, it's not, you know, doge or Shiba. It's Solana. So we see their traction there. So I think it's about this idea of, like, okay, do people see, you know, phantom on Ledger and Solana as their home base? So that could be the next generation.
00:23:24.266 - 00:23:50.190, Speaker A: Great. Home base is a good reference point. One reference I used to after, let's call it the capital markets in cryptocurrencies became professionalized or serious, whatever you want to call it, 2017. It wasn't just a couple of folks. Crypto capital markets became real. And I predicted nfts would be next. My system was not.
00:23:50.190 - 00:24:11.114, Speaker A: I like nfts. It was. I saw the human capital peel off from Wall street and say, I want real risk. I'm going into this. I started to say in 2017 that real artists, I could see the human capital migrating, right? So I had no idea that nfts were going to have a product market fit. But I said, people are moving, so I think it's going to happen. Right.
00:24:11.114 - 00:24:39.912, Speaker A: Where do you guys see any human capital right now coming into crypto that you didn't see before? And when I say human capital, I mean the professional level of human capital. Right? So is there anyone, and I'm going to go with you first, Chris, here, just because you had a good appetite for these first ones, is that something you look at? Do you believe that thesis makes sense? I'm not saying if you've deployed it, but do you look at people and say, I see a lot of people in this job, that industry is going to change next?
00:24:40.088 - 00:25:27.532, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe another way to reframe it is, I'm assuming, a lot of investors like us, we like to look for what people do on their own spare time and free time, the things people are playing with for their own fun time. And you're seeing a lot more of these artists play around with nfts. You're starting to see crypto, people play around with daos, you're starting to see people play with financial systems. But this is where you want to spend your attention and not just the technical people. Because when you talk about creator economy or nfts, the real artists, the real makers, they tend to be on the less technical side of the spectrum. So even today, like metaplex and Canning machine is a fantastic thing to use, but it's still very developer centric. It's still hard to use this if you're like the end photographer or the end painter or whatever.
00:25:27.532 - 00:25:50.170, Speaker B: And so I think we're going to see expansion of the people who can use all of these creator tools and systems and other things being built to enable all these things to be used by more and more people. Because that's the only way you're going to scale this to be a billion people. The creators can't only be small technical developers. We're going to have to expand the pie of who we consider to be creators in the first place.
00:25:50.322 - 00:25:52.626, Speaker A: Yeah, Bec, let me know what you think about that.
00:25:52.730 - 00:27:16.374, Speaker E: Yeah, this is like the perfect topic that we've been thinking about. Because right now when we see these protocols, I think there's a lot of these destination experience where people go for seeking yield alpha and they turn away as these things slow down. And when we incubated Xie Infinity and run for sandbox and mythical games and decentraland, our goal was really trying to create attractive entertainment space in metaverse and can we provide enough fund that people would stick around rather than comfort destination and build social capital? And we see that there's still quite a gap, I think even in Solana as well, we couldn't wait anymore. So what we are doing is we bought two gaming studios in Korea, and that's a team of 40 people, game developer designers, game economists. And we're building five different games on top of Solana Tera Ethereum to really close the gap so that we can provide and move fast to provide those experiences so that maybe the next generation of talents coming into this industry can see a modal case of what can be done and what kind of experience can be done and possibly build better apps down the line. And you know, I think that's when really we truly see these billion dau. Like Xe is still only one 2 million DAU.
00:27:16.374 - 00:27:19.474, Speaker E: And that's probably best. And we need to get further.
00:27:20.254 - 00:28:00.750, Speaker A: You know, you were mentioning a little bit about, let's call it the ability to attract those people. And space you see when they're applying is not the word, but trying to push in. And I'd say at Binance labs, you probably have the best bird's eye view in the industry just because almost everybody knocks on your door first in this sort of tinkerer world. Right. So are you able to just like, just see the volume of projects that come in with one idea in mind and say something in this realm is going to work? Because everybody's trying this thing. It's not just me, it's in the collective unconscious. This is going to be a product.
00:28:00.750 - 00:28:04.594, Speaker A: Are you able to look into all of the people trying to reach out to you and decipher stuff?
00:28:05.134 - 00:28:43.394, Speaker F: Right, yeah, for sure. I think there's out of, say, like 200 projects that I look at, there's a clear pattern of what's the next trend. And it's interesting to note that probably recently all the projects are doing something in the NFT space and doing something in the metaverse space. What is the metaverse? I don't know for sure, but we are in a phase where we are defining what that means. It can be a gaming world, it can be a complete virtual world. I think on Solana itself, it's interesting to see the NFT space develop. I can see that.
00:28:43.394 - 00:29:15.432, Speaker F: I think NFTs as a non fungible token, essentially a different kind of token. It's a foundational block of a new era that's going to come in. Just looking at NFTs on Solana. I just got my first Solana monkey business NFT a couple of days ago, joining the monkey Dao, and I think it's fantastic to see the whole space just blow up. The PFE space is blooming right now, and that's only the start. I think there will be a lot more things to come. And what exactly metaverse means, we'll slowly find out over the next year or so.
00:29:15.568 - 00:29:42.298, Speaker A: So, Amos, you've been like, let's say, working off your predictions for years now because you knew the icos were coming before anyone. You knew that you would be able to take these digital assets and turn them into other things. I think that's what we didn't know yet. You were willing to turn them into other things. Do you have any prediction that would surprise us just because you've been right about your predictions? Is there a prediction you have that would surprise this audience here for the next little while?
00:29:42.386 - 00:30:10.314, Speaker D: So at first I was wrong. Also, a lot of times we've all been wrong. To me, I look at nfts in general and I think we just started to scratch right what we can imagine. And to me, it's one of the most exciting things that happened in crypto in the past ten years, because it's what really going to bring mass adoption. I believe we'll start seeing everyone kind of like using nfts. They will not call it nfts. Right.
00:30:10.314 - 00:30:17.122, Speaker D: So to me, it's kind of like a big box where we still need to imagine what is it going to be?
00:30:17.178 - 00:30:39.554, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm going to try and get one more question in. Let's go with Joe. Just because I want to hear along those lines. What's next? But I guess the idea is, you know, are we gonna. How do I put it? Well, anyway, we're out of time, guys. I got screwed up by that.
00:30:39.554 - 00:30:49.014, Speaker A: Not gonna add one more question in. All right, guys, they're gonna be right there. You can ask them questions. Ask them anything. Wag me. We're all gonna make it. Great, everyone.
00:30:49.014 - 00:30:50.334, Speaker A: See you all at a stupa free tonight.
