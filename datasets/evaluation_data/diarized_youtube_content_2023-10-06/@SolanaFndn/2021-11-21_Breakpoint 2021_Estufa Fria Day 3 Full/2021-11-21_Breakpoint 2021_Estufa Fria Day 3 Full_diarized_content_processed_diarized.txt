00:00:20.160 - 00:00:31.064, Speaker A: Now, what I am seeing here, especially within the Solana community, is nothing short of awesome. We're earmarking with the Solana Foundation $50.
00:00:31.144 - 00:00:35.456, Speaker B: Million to invest in the next wave.
00:00:35.520 - 00:00:49.564, Speaker A: Of social built on Solana. We're going to increase it to $100 million. See that? We lured you in with a 50. Surprise you with the hundo.
00:01:07.224 - 00:01:07.976, Speaker C: All right.
00:01:08.120 - 00:01:37.382, Speaker D: Good afternoon. Welcome back to the growth stage. This is the beginning of the end of breakpoint at this stage, but we still have plenty more to come today. Thank you all for coming out. I hope you all had good mornings. And then we're going to really just kick things off pretty quickly here. So one of the things that you've seen across the conference so far is a real focus on the next wave of innovation that's getting built on blockchain.
00:01:37.382 - 00:01:38.414, Speaker D: So what does this mean?
00:01:38.454 - 00:01:38.750, Speaker A: Right.
00:01:38.822 - 00:02:13.442, Speaker D: You start off with tokens as value. You move into things like smart contracts, enabling defi, and then there's a whole service and interoperability built around that. And the expansion now is moving into totally new areas. You saw the Alexis and 776 announcement yesterday that they're putting a bunch of effort into social tokens and social projects being built on Solana and other blockchains. And a whole other area of that, too, is, of course, gaming. So the render announcement yesterday that they're bringing their engine and their smart contract system to Solana as well. I personally am very excited about that.
00:02:13.442 - 00:02:30.854, Speaker D: I think there's huge hopes for what their technology and what they've built, and being able to integrate that into this new world of gaming and the intersection of gaming and blockchain is really interesting, because if you think about it, these models that have existed for a long time about in game currency was a blockchain without a blockchain.
00:02:30.894 - 00:02:31.070, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:31.102 - 00:02:57.674, Speaker D: It was peer to peer trading of items. If you roll back all the way to the days where people were trading World of Warcraft gold on eBay. Right. All of the framework for this was written in this sort of transition from web one to web two. But with the advent of web3, we're now finally seeing a truly peer to peer marketplace for this sort of stuff developing and building out. So we're going to start off today with permissionless fun in the future of gaining moderated by Colleen.
00:03:11.034 - 00:03:21.730, Speaker A: Testing. All right, there we go. Thanks, Austin, for the great intro. I think before we dive into it, we can have our panel just very quickly introduce themselves if we want to go down the line.
00:03:21.922 - 00:03:33.774, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. Amy Wu, partner at Lightspeed, and I lead our crypto and gaming investing. We just announced $100 million fund along with FTX and Solana.
00:03:34.994 - 00:03:59.382, Speaker A: My name is Alex Paley, co founder and CEO of Faraway, and Amy just led our series a along with Colleen and Solana. Hi, everyone. I'm Michael Liu, the technical lead with star Atlas. And I've been working in crypto defi space for five, six years now. Project to project, and this is my most favorite one yet. Awesome. Thanks, guys.
00:03:59.382 - 00:04:11.914, Speaker A: So to set the groundwork a little bit, Amy, I guess maybe this is a question for you. How do we think about what's different about web3 games versus traditional web two games?
00:04:12.574 - 00:05:19.008, Speaker E: So how I think about it is first and foremost in terms of the shift from web two to web3 gaming starts with an ideological one, and we're basically moving from web two, centralized profit making, to a web3, more decentralized profit sharing between creators, you know, and users. And this is a really important shift that, I mean, gaming game publishers and companies in web two need to really understand. And so when we talk about web3 gaming, it involves various use cases of blockchain in gaming. And so I think we're starting to see some of these use cases come out. Like, for example, using nfts as a prelaunch user acquisition and community building drive, and then also tokenized currencies. And the thing is, is that these concepts, in terms of digital assets and also in game currencies has been concepts that have been around for decades in the gaming world. And so it's such a natural extension of that to actually incorporate blockchain tech.
00:05:19.008 - 00:05:34.594, Speaker E: And I think some of the things that you can do is you can deepen game economies, you can increase velocity of transactions in these games and also introduce a lot of different strategies you can incorporate in terms of different segments of your gamers as well.
00:05:36.374 - 00:06:08.880, Speaker A: Awesome. I was going to say. I think it's also the difference between an open economy and a closed economy. In a free to play game, the economy is created and live operated by either the GM of that game, the game designers, or the liveops managers. And in a web3 economy, it's open by definition and intrinsically. Right, because peer to peer trading is automatically enabled. And in a free to play type of game design, you would think that if you enabled peer to peer trading, that would be an insane decision.
00:06:08.880 - 00:07:06.046, Speaker A: It would be very, very controversial because it typically breaks a lot of the free to play game loops that you'd see in most free to play games today. So I think it really, like Amy said, deepens the economies and makes things a lot more open. Awesome. So actually double clicking on that a little bit, what's different? What kind of game loops can we now create that we couldn't before? And I guess that's a question for both Alex and Michael, since you guys are thinking pretty deeply about that. Sure, go ahead. So the question was, what can we do differently now before than we could before? Yeah, I mean, the realism of the transfers and the transactions to the user and capturing that dream for your typical gamer. Because when you think about it in the gaming space, traditionally you have this experience and you're crafting something for a user regardless of the genre of the game.
00:07:06.046 - 00:07:52.998, Speaker A: And now it not only becomes something that's a pastime, but it could be a full time as well. And it's really interesting how with defi integrations into gaming, this becomes someone's career as opposed to somebody's hobby. It's pretty interesting because if you look at any MMO, you kill a monster, you get gold. Now all of a sudden, that gold is freely tradable in an open market. So like Michael was saying, that opens up a lot of Defi applications and it opens up a lot of more social interactions between our players. Right. They no longer are, you know, all of the currency they own is now freely tradable.
00:07:52.998 - 00:08:19.678, Speaker A: Right. They can do anything they want with it. And I think that just like I was saying before, just makes these economies much more interesting and much more similar to a, you know, Irl type of economy. Yeah. So you guys touched on a big thing, which is now there's money involved. Like I as a player can earn these in game assets and I can also sell them. How do you think that changes the psychology of gaming for web3 gaming? Because now it's not just purely fun.
00:08:19.678 - 00:08:46.398, Speaker A: Now there's money that I might make. Yeah, there's money involved. And I think people will play these games in many different types of ways. Right? It's like we're making a shooter. But just like you've seen in Eve online, some of the best players in Eve don't even log into the game. They're playing this game in a way that the game developers never even predicted. So for us, peer to peer treating is enabled, and now a person might never play the shooter that we made.
00:08:46.398 - 00:09:04.772, Speaker A: They might say, we are going to be the masters of the peer to peer marketplace and we are going to create all of these interesting defi applications on top of that. So I think it's like the realm of possible players is going to be greatly expanded past what you'd consider a typical gamer in a free to play game.
00:09:04.948 - 00:09:24.692, Speaker E: I think about it as some people actually equate blockchain gaming with play to earn. But actually it's the first, I think, iteration of what this actually looks like. I believe that play and earn is a lot bigger, actually. So play to earn essentially the equivalent of gold farming, like in traditional games.
00:09:24.748 - 00:09:24.916, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:24.940 - 00:10:15.794, Speaker E: And I think there's a huge market for that because there are more people that live in emerging markets that actually where this could be a replacement for income. Especially when there's hundreds of blockchain games options and they can move from one to another as they're doing incentives. But actually, if you look at the kind of 2 billion plus gamers today, the trade off, the decision making is okay, I can play this Call of Duty game, but if I can play another Call of Duty game and earn money while doing that, I probably would rather do the latter. All else being equal in terms of the game being fun, deep, et cetera. And so that's really the promise here, is that some people may be earning an income, but you have a far larger group of players that actually can just earn some amount of money or have fun speculating, but mostly are just playing the game.
00:10:17.134 - 00:11:01.444, Speaker A: What I love the most about it is kind of the impact this has on the player. So the stakes are higher. It's no longer bits and bytes, it's still bits and bytes, but it's no longer just bits and bytes that you check out and it's done. And so at Star Atlas, what's super cool is I observe that we see these player organizations, and you might see this too, these player organizations springing up around the game and getting involved and almost becoming their own mini companies. In a way, they're many literal organizations. So because these stakes are higher, we see that. We see the players getting involved on a much more real level and investing themselves further than in any gaming space before.
00:11:01.444 - 00:11:17.026, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. I recently learned that in Eve, I guess they were, you know, corporations that actually had like their own HR departments. So I guess there's some precedent for this even in web two. But I think web3 will just kind of blow the top. Floodgates are open.
00:11:17.090 - 00:11:46.354, Speaker E: Yeah, actually, like Eve Online is a great example of that where it's like an OG guilds, right? And you know, like digital economy, metaverse. There are like thousands of corporations and some of the largest. These corporations are 10,000 plus players strong. And they have roles, responsibilities. There's a warlord at the top of that, CEO of that. These are real life experiences that actually these players and Eve online is 15 years old. So imagine how much more real that becomes when you have these tokenized economies.
00:11:46.354 - 00:12:07.124, Speaker E: You can have these corporations or guilds that actually maybe fractionalize and, I don't know, sell their own equity type of thing, and another guild can actually help fund their first pool of ships that they're building. I think it just opens up so much more possibility when it becomes an open economy, to Pele's point.
00:12:07.664 - 00:12:32.250, Speaker A: Totally. I can't wait to see some activist hedge funds. It's already happening, right? It's like they're acquiring land, which is why it just opens up the possible. I think what you'd consider a player of your game has drastically changed. In an open economy, a hedge fund is a player. A person who's a mother who has never played their game in the Philippines is now a player of your game. So I'm a player, right? Yeah.
00:12:32.250 - 00:13:21.240, Speaker A: I think things are going to be pretty wild. Okay. Changing track a little bit. And we started touching on this, I think, for web3. A big part of the appeal and what's unique about it is composability. The fact that the assets that I own or earn in game could have uses in other applications on salon or on whatever l one, which is a pretty new concept for anyone, but especially games and game builders who previously fought for a lot of control over the experience and over the game economy. So how do you guys see composability sort of growing from here? Or if you do, or if you think games will still be largely closed loops, how does this play out? And Mike is Michael, you can start with that.
00:13:21.240 - 00:14:08.172, Speaker A: Sure. Well, there's kind of two main approaches to composability in gaming that we've seen arise. And one is kind of this black box architecture where you have the blockchain layer integrated and there's integrated kind of loosely like it's on a server. It's more of like a typical client server relationship with the game client and the game logic executing on the server side. What I think is going to continue to evolve is we're going to see game mechanics transfer over to the smart contract layer on the blockchain. And the reason for this is that we're working with people's assets here. And as a user, security and trust in the workings of the game, I think are paramount.
00:14:08.172 - 00:14:25.454, Speaker A: And if you can have game mechanics through this, like layer on the blockchain, actually working together across ecosystems, even then, the value added to the user is immense. It adds that security that trust and will grow the ecosystem as a whole.
00:14:26.434 - 00:15:04.458, Speaker E: I think about your question in terms of interoperability of in game items, right. And so I think that you typically don't see that right now in web two games. And the reason, it's pretty simple. It doesn't benefit the game publisher. If you're a game publisher, you have a game with 100 million players. Why would you let another game studio actually be able to use a very popular item in your own game? First and foremost, and that's separate from interoperability is great for the player. Basically, you buy the item once and maybe you can use it a few different other ways and get a lot more value out of the item.
00:15:04.458 - 00:16:02.364, Speaker E: The question is just on the other side, what's the incentive for the game studio to actually allow interoperability? And then you get into practical considerations. Game studios are building games on different gaming engines. So how does that work when one is on Unreal and the other is on unity? Then there's the. Okay, well, it's one thing to imagine if you bought a skin, then maybe you can use, I don't know, a hat or something like in your avatar, use it on another game, in your avatar there. But if the game actually has, if the in game item has power, how does that translate to another game? And so I think there are a lot of real world implications of interoperability that are just like, remains to be seen. But I think it will definitely take a studio that wants to really experiment with that. And potentially we'll see it first with a gaming publisher that is allowing interoperability between a few games in their ecosystem before we'll see it between studios.
00:16:03.724 - 00:16:17.104, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I guess it's basically there's a financial incentives piece of, like, why do I care if other, like, why I have no incentive to let other games interoperate with my assets. And then there's a logistical and mechanical challenge to this.
00:16:17.484 - 00:16:32.874, Speaker E: A blockchain gaming founder, I asked him this question once, told me, why would I let another game developer, vampire, attack my own game? So I do think there's, I'm very interested in. You've seen the first execution of interoperability.
00:16:33.414 - 00:17:12.614, Speaker A: Totally. Okay. So I want to switch tracks again a little bit to the user experience or the gamer experience, because I think one of the consistent pieces of feedback that people give about web3, whether they're gamers or otherwise, is that it's an awful first time user experience. Like, I have to go get KYC in exchange, get some coins, put them on a wallet. I now have to custody that wallet and make sure I don't lose the seed phrase, et cetera, et cetera. How do you guys think about solving that first time user experience for gamers on your games? I guess this is for Michael and Alex. Sure.
00:17:12.614 - 00:18:02.894, Speaker A: Well, our solution at Star Outlast is through the user experience. So we kind of prioritize that experience over other things and focus on making the experience as native to the gaming industry as they're used to. So you're right. Exactly. When you get into crypto, there's a lot of barriers in the way, and there's some knowledge barriers and physical barriers just getting your assets in the first place. So I think any game that's going to be successful on the Solana blockchain needs to solve the user experience and the onboarding ramps for those users through simplifying their interfaces and improving the experience end to end, as well as the training and documentation and just knowledge building for the community. Yeah, so, and I guess from the way that we're approaching it is we're going to be the first end to end wallet solution, like integrating FTX.
00:18:02.894 - 00:18:35.934, Speaker A: So a person is literally going to be able to sign up for our game, create a username, and they'll automatically have an FTX account. And our goal is to just abstract away all the complexity from the player experience. The player doesn't need to know anything about a seed phrase. All they need to know is their assets are there, they're safe, and they can do whatever they want with them. Awesome. So, okay, I'm going to probe on this one a little bit more. My hypothesis is that at the start, the vast majority of gamers, especially those that are not crypto native, don't care about self custody.
00:18:35.934 - 00:19:44.634, Speaker A: They're perfectly happy with some sort of custodial solution. But the thing I wonder about is, you know what? And so maybe it's like, initially it's like 98% of gamers custody, and then there's like some 2% who actually care about this and, you know, not your keys, not your coins kind of attitude. Do you guys have a view on, like, how. How quickly or how many people might, you know, go into that self custody mode? Like, are we gonna be in a world in which, like, everyone self custodies, or are we always gonna live in a world where some people just don't want to engage with it? I think just like you have casual players and hardcore players, you're going to have people that are more casual about self custodying saying, I don't care about the complexity. I just care about the fact that my assets are safe and whatever custodial wallet they're in. And then of course there will be hardcore players who have millions or maybe even tens of millions of dollars in assets. And they say, you know what, I really want to understand how this works and I want to have the knowledge that I own everything myself, but I think that will be a small fraction of gamers.
00:19:44.634 - 00:19:52.234, Speaker A: Totally makes sense. Yeah. Once you have enough money on the line, you're like, well, maybe I should take better care of it. Okay.
00:19:54.254 - 00:20:51.924, Speaker E: On this onboarding point, I'll just say one thing. I mean, the first time I started playing Axie Infinity, I think it took me 36 hours, hours to actually start playing the game, or longer than that. And then in terms of just going through the entire journey and trying to get money out of Axie infinity, took me a couple of days before it finally settled. And I mean, the fact that they're doing over like 10 million in revenue a day right now just speaks to how badly people want to play that. Because I actually, because in the web two gaming world, game developers actually think about time to fun in the span of minutes rather than days. And because people's attention spans are short, like if there's hundreds of options or thousands of options for you to be playing from or choosing from. And so I think we're a long ways to go in terms of just making, I mean, not just gaming, but just actually like DeFi Web three experiences easier for just your average normal consumer.
00:20:51.924 - 00:20:58.924, Speaker E: And I think people who solve that are just going to, are going to be at an advantage.
00:21:00.464 - 00:21:07.288, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. It didn't take me 36 hours, I think initially, but it was like twelve for me, for Axie. Okay.
00:21:07.376 - 00:21:10.684, Speaker E: I'm technologically inept though. I think that's why it took me so long.
00:21:11.504 - 00:21:58.140, Speaker A: Okay. But so, yeah, clearly there's like this onboarding piece that's a challenge. But I'm curious, I guess Alex and Michael in particular. From a game builder's perspective, what do you think are the biggest challenges or risks for aspiring or people already building web3 games in terms of actually being able to realize their visions? What's hard? Yeah, I think when you build any game, whether it's a web3 game or a web two game, it's all about layering complexity. You usually have your early life cycle, your mid cycle, and then your end game. And the way that you bring a player through that is you give them something easy to just start getting going on. So for us, we have a shooter built on top of a strategy game, the shooter is meant to be a game mechanic that's just very well understood.
00:21:58.140 - 00:23:04.216, Speaker A: Everybody knows how to play a shooter. We're going to bring people through the funnel through a very easy to understand shooter, and then we're going to start introducing all of the complexity of the strategy game in the mid funnel and then the end game. But I think every, every blockchain game developer today should be very careful about how much complexity they introduce to the player. Day one, because we do have open economies. Now, these open economies are extremely complex. There's a million things you can do in these open economies, but you don't want to expose the player to so much complexity on day one that they just throw up their hands and say, I don't even know what to do, because they will leave your game and kind of tapping to the last thought about the economies. It's like when you're building a game and you're kind of a steward of that realm of what you're building for the players and it's your job kind of, to ensure that you're not messing it up for them, right? So you create a $300 million economy for them and their assumption is they can keep existing in it, you know, playing to earn and having a great time.
00:23:04.216 - 00:24:03.964, Speaker A: So there's also in the crypto gaming space some awareness that needs to be built towards that and figuring out really how do you integrate changes in your gameplay safely without disrupting that for the user. And I think a lot of this is, I mean, I call it also just community driven game development too, because you're constantly communicating with your players. You see all these discord communities around blockchain gaming. They're extremely collaborative. So if you're going to introduce changes to your gameplay or to your meta, you need to surface these changes, get the okay from your players that they understand what's going to happen and they're good with it. And then, yeah, you can make the changes, but unlike in free to play, where you make the changes with the release of a new update to your app, I think in blockchain gaming you need to be a lot more communicative with your player base about upcoming changes. Awesome.
00:24:03.964 - 00:24:37.326, Speaker A: Okay, so so far, you know, people have tried building web3 games for a few years now, but we've only really started seeing standout successes pretty recently. And I'm kind of curious, you know, as you look forward, whether it's like six months, twelve months, two years. Amy, are there any particular, like, themes, whether it's genres of games, or something specific that, you know, categories of things that you think will be particularly successful in the. In the near term. Like, is it like, you know, hey, card games are good for nfts. And so, like, I expect card games to do well. I don't know any.
00:24:37.326 - 00:24:42.806, Speaker A: Do you think about like a genre lens or any sort of specific category that you're particularly excited about?
00:24:42.950 - 00:25:33.442, Speaker E: Yeah, there's, there's a number and I think at a high level it starts with how big are some of these genres today? Right. And then you go from there. Largest game genre is actually shooter games. And so I actually think some of the first shooter games we're going to see, some of the first games we'll see dropping nfts on a mass level are going to be shooters, but I'm not sure that those are necessarily in and of itself going to have the deepest integrations with blockchain. And so some of the genres I'm super excited about are MMO just because it's the closest to the idea of the metaverse. Right. And so moving from like a artificial digital currency to tokenized currencies seems like a very natural step in addition to just, you know, launching nfts, which I think we'll see not, I mean, we're seeing like companies doing that now.
00:25:33.442 - 00:26:25.396, Speaker E: We'll see like large gaming publishers do that. But I feel like, you know, just that in itself is. Doesn't actually explore the full potential of blockchain and some of the other genres that are interesting. Definitely card collectibles because literally you have collectibles as part of the core gameplay. And then I think forex games, land strategy games, super interesting because again, this concept, the land sale then becomes organically incorporated into a game as well. I think in terms of more mid core gaming, it's interesting because these are games in which some players get super involved and you have really deep game economies that blockchain will actually deepen. And also you can do a lot with experimentation around tokenomics in some of these mid core games.
00:26:25.396 - 00:26:28.452, Speaker E: So those are some of the genres that I think about.
00:26:28.628 - 00:27:08.984, Speaker A: Yeah, I think honestly, a lot of these genres, almost any genre can have a land mechanic or like a territory capture, territory control. Even if you consider your land mechanic just your home base that you're decorating, there is always a reason to have a place of permanence that you consider your home, especially as we gravitate more towards this metaverse or virtual world vision. Totally. Okay. And I think this might be the final question to leave it off. And this is for the entire panel. But what do you guys think are the key factors for success to make a web3 game going forward?
00:27:09.724 - 00:27:51.564, Speaker E: I can start and then love to hear from the game makers. For me, what am I looking for right now? Again, we're at the ground floor. Basically, Axie Infinity is pretty much the only mainstream blockchain game that's live right now. And I think that in the near term there is a first mover advantage. If you're going to launch your game, I don't mean launch nfts, I mean actually launch your game in terms of players playing it, because there's way more people who want to play a blockchain game than there are actually live games out there right now. But if you fast forward, some of the best games take years to build. I think Valorant took seven years to build.
00:27:51.564 - 00:28:34.806, Speaker E: And so once there are hundreds of games out there, then people have choice. And again, I think it's not enough actually to have just play to earn dynamics. You actually need ways to capture and retain players long term. And in the web two world, you see some games have decades of longevity because of these social layers and ways to capture the audience for long periods of time and really build affinity to the game. And so in terms of what we're looking for, I think that in web3, your ability to build community is absolutely essential. Like, and I've talked about that a lot. However, it's very difficult to build a great game.
00:28:34.806 - 00:28:58.834, Speaker E: And so as an investor, I always look for game making experience in the core team. It doesn't need to be if you're the founders. Ideally somebody on your team has game design experience, but if you don't that you have hired somebody onto the team with that experience. Because I think it's absolutely essential in terms of building a game, particularly in a more complex genre.
00:28:59.934 - 00:29:51.024, Speaker A: My answer is sort of simple, that all blockchain games need to remind themselves that they're games. And in order for a game to stay around for 1020 years, that game must be social. And I think one of the things that we're seeing in a lot of these play to earn games is that sort of two classes of players have emerged. You've had these antisocial gamers and basically the antisocial grinders, and then you have antisocial speculators who typically buy an asset and never come back to your game. But games last a long time because the communities that form, so I think start sort of like what Amy's saying. Community is extremely important in blockchain gaming and the game mechanics need to reward socializing and community building within those games. And a lot of these blockchain games today, you can be a completely anti social gamer and still accrue something of on chain value.
00:29:51.024 - 00:31:03.478, Speaker A: But I think in the game that we're designing, at least we are saying that in order to actually accrue significant value, you need to be part of a clan, you need to do these social activities. And I mean in any game, like in any long lasting game, whether it's World of Warcraft, guild wars, whatever, or in real life, like, the only way to accrue real value is by, you know, working with others or contributing it back to your community. I like to think of the place we are right now in crypto gaming as kind of like the Flash era of crypto gaming. If you guys remember, back in the early two thousands, there was a lot of little 2d interactive games that were flooding the Internet and were a lot of fun to play. And where we're moving next is, and the next steps for gaming on the blockchain is high fidelity of fantastic end to end user experience and a AAA feel to what you're pushing out. So once we move into that realm where studios are actually creating these immense and immersive experiences, already integrated with the blockchain layer, that's going to seal the deal. So yeah, I believe in social a lot more than I believe in AAA.
00:31:03.478 - 00:31:40.742, Speaker A: I think in the past year or two years, we've seen a lot of amazing, amazing games that have ascended to the top, whether it's Valheim, fall guys that have had hundreds of millions of users, millions and millions of concurrent users, and they have been successful, not because they have the best graphics, but because they have the most social gameplay. And I think that's why games last a long time, because of the bonds that you form with your friend groups. We have people in our games that are only friends with people in the game. Like they call each other by their nicknames in the game. Like, that's why games last. So it's not going to be AAA experiences, it's going to be social games.
00:31:40.878 - 00:32:14.514, Speaker E: I totally agree. I mean, this is where, I mean, the average player on Roblox plays for two and a half hours, which I think is insane. There's actually people on average in these top games, whether it's Fortnite or game on Roblox or League of Legends, actually spend more time there than actually in social networks necessarily. Which is why I think although gaming and social are coming together, and we believe at Lightspeed, at least that actually the next social networks may be born from games. And so I 100% agree with you on the social element of it.
00:32:14.594 - 00:32:48.134, Speaker A: And we're making browser games, which are by definition not high fidelity, but what they are is extremely social. I can send you a link and you can play with me in a matter of seconds. And our goal is to bring billions of players to this new web3 economy. And you can't do that unless your game is social, has game mechanics, are social, and is extremely shareable. I think you're absolutely right. And it's not either social or AAA experience. I think the thing that's going to seal the deal and be the game is social and AAA.
00:32:48.134 - 00:33:16.148, Speaker A: Maybe. But I think with Roblox we have definitely seen that you do not need AAA experience. 100% agree to have an amazing, vibrant economy. Yeah, interesting some dissent on the panel. I guess my two cent on this one is that as a gamer at least, I'd love to have both. So I can at least use my expensive graphics card for something. Yeah, if you can get one.
00:33:16.148 - 00:33:33.134, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. If I can get one. All right, I know we're at time. I'm gonna sneak in one last question, which is if you had, you know, is there any game that you've played in the past, whether as a kid or whatever, that you really enjoyed and wish someone would make a web3 version of.
00:33:36.194 - 00:33:44.934, Speaker E: I love Diablo and so I grew up playing that. And I am looking forward to buying NFT Diablo items if that ever happens.
00:33:45.874 - 00:34:05.734, Speaker A: I mean, my favorite game of all time is elder scrolls three morrowind. I'm a big rpg player. If somebody made a web3 version of that with an open economy, I probably wouldn't come out of my room for maybe a year. I'm in the same boat as you. Action RPG's are where it's at. I personally like path of exile. Diablo's fun too.
00:34:05.734 - 00:34:31.650, Speaker A: But yeah, those items where you've got the randomly generated loot, imagine if something super cool drops. It's an NFT, you can trade it. That really captures my imagination. Awesome. For me, it's a web3 version of darkest dungeon indie game, for those of you guys don't know. But anyway, so for all the game builders out there, there's a couple of multimillion dollar ideas for you to go pursue. Ok, thank you everyone for the time.
00:34:31.650 - 00:34:43.534, Speaker A: Thanks audience, for being out here. I think we'll wrap up now. Awesome. I'm good.
00:34:46.214 - 00:35:20.608, Speaker D: All right, so we're all here and one of the really interesting things about being here is coordination. So this is a distributed conference. I'm sure a lot of you have had questions about where should I go at what times. You've looked at schedules, you've asked people for recommendations on it. We started off looking at DeFi and a lot of these infrastructure plays to help people get decentralized. Finance really running in a way that doesn't require any sort of centralization. The bridges are becoming more decentralized.
00:35:20.608 - 00:35:58.512, Speaker D: We're moving to places where, like, that system is pretty mature, right? We see what the basics look like for this, and now we're moving forward and building new products and services that are more user friendly. And now it's time for the hard stuff. And me is having a political science background. That's definitely the governance question, right? Governments are inherently in the web zero world. What do we call the real world these days? Are inherently centralized. They have processes where any sort of voting system requires huge amounts of information on behalf of the people actually voting. Or they require representation systems which have their own set of problems.
00:35:58.512 - 00:36:11.594, Speaker D: So it's time to address some of the hard questions in blockchain. One of those is daos. How do you build them? How do they work? What are the best structures for them, and what lessons can we learn about this sort of governance and a decentralized future?
00:36:30.434 - 00:36:33.338, Speaker A: Testing, testing. Hello, everyone.
00:36:33.506 - 00:37:00.086, Speaker F: Welcome to our panel. Today we're here in the Dao or dai panel with some of the DaO experts in the field, Solana ecosystem and other ecosystems. So very good to have you all up here. The format for this panel is actually going to be very loose. I'm not going to try and give these guys too many questions because they're much more experts on this subject than I am. So I just want them to talk in between themselves. If anyone has a question for someone else on the panel, please feel free to do so.
00:37:00.086 - 00:37:13.994, Speaker F: Don't need to wait for me to have a question to start. But I guess to get this kicked off, my question to each of you is, what do you see as a Dao and what are you working around in the world of Daos? If you'd like to start, Gustav?
00:37:14.894 - 00:37:22.294, Speaker G: I mean, I think, like, is it working okay. Oh, there we go.
00:37:25.594 - 00:37:29.882, Speaker A: Okay, stick it, stick it.
00:37:30.018 - 00:37:31.082, Speaker F: We're off to a great start.
00:37:31.138 - 00:37:32.250, Speaker A: Stick it like this.
00:37:32.442 - 00:37:35.138, Speaker G: Maybe, Julian, you can go first. Yeah, I think it fell off.
00:37:35.186 - 00:37:36.442, Speaker F: Max, you want to take it off?
00:37:36.538 - 00:37:40.934, Speaker A: Okay, can you repeat the question? Yeah, absolutely. So.
00:37:42.834 - 00:37:49.360, Speaker F: I'd love to hear what is a Dao to you and what are you working on that. That pertains to this subject.
00:37:49.512 - 00:38:21.104, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. For me, Dao is really about bringing people together with a shared vision, but without claiming ownership of their whole identity. It's really about bringing people on an anonymous and very easy going way to work on something. Maybe on the weekend, maybe more full time, maybe their whole fucking life, but without demanding like total loyalty. So for me it has really like a hardcore anarchist vibe, like we're giving people something, but we're not forcing them to anything.
00:38:23.084 - 00:38:57.334, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean for me I just see it as the natural evolution of what's been happening in the concept and the philosophy of open source to begin with. So if you look back about eleven years ago, GitHub really started to drive a lot of the open source development, which meant teams could come from all around the world and collaborate on open source software. And now Daos are actually expanding that well beyond just software developers. It's basically anybody that wants to participate in a network and share their skills, be a part of a community. And I think that that's extremely powerful because it takes the open source philosophy and extends it way beyond just software development.
00:39:00.314 - 00:39:56.244, Speaker C: Yeah, so my personal experience with Daos are like I'm involving four different daos, Curve Finance, Stakedao, Blackpool and Rec news. And this is like full time. So the point is with Daos you can be involved in many different projects without having the title full time in just one company. So even if I'm full time in those different projects, I can still be involved in all the different projects in the ecosystem. And just by participating inside those projects I can earn those governance tokens that in traditional finance you can associate them to equity. But that's, that's the point is like whatever you do in this ecar system, you wake up in the morning, you work all day, you acquire Dow shares in the entire ecosystem. So you feel be part, you actually be part of this entire family of building this entire new paradigm that is competing with traditional finance.
00:39:58.364 - 00:40:48.864, Speaker G: Yeah, I think my microphone works now. So yeah, I've been part of Megadow for almost three and a half years now. So kind of like seeing the progression we've had there where we went from being, working on a centralized foundation to now being a full on Dao, where not just decision making but salaries, like basically everything, even product direction is taking under a dao format. And apart from that I also work with a lot of the portfolio companies we have at stable node with building their governance frameworks and structures. So at stable node we both build, help them define what the process frameworks needs to look like. But we also become an active participant afterwards. So we are an active participant and active delegate in several other protocols, both DeFi protocols and layer one networks.
00:40:48.864 - 00:41:20.004, Speaker G: And I also think today we see there's many different types of dials. I think we've also seen, especially like the investment daos and like art collection daos really like gaining momentum where it's just like a way for people to collaborate under a different setting, I guess a setting where I can share the financial outcome of what you're doing in a fair and equal way. And there's of course, like many types of governance and many types of daos. So, yeah, it's like a very broad topic, I guess.
00:41:20.544 - 00:41:56.160, Speaker F: Yeah, absolutely. And I think you touched on something quite interesting which was at maker, at the beginning, it was a team that came together, it could be considered centralized, and then it had this progression to becoming a DAO. I think that's a very not contentious, but a subject that everyone needs to discuss and think about, because in this industry, a lot of these different businesses will have to move to that model to be safe in a regulatory environment. But I'd love to hear like advice or a roadmap from you guys on how companies that maybe start with two co founders or three co founders can expand that into a DaO format and actually get to a place where it is decentralized. Julian, you want to kick it off?
00:41:56.272 - 00:42:50.382, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. We started a year and a half ago. Two years ago there was like five people, and now, like, I know, like there's a 40 chairs on Twitter, but now we're like 75 people across those many different projects. So you can start really quick, quickly into like an idea and then bootstrap a project. But what's really cool is by using those, like building a DaO right now, there's like few different aspects of the Dao you can follow and that will make at least the functioning of the DaO pretty efficient. So you will do like snapshot that basically, and then a forum that basically will incentivize or will get people to add value to your project or add feedback. And snapshot is for voting mechanism on top of your dao.
00:42:50.382 - 00:43:24.294, Speaker C: And then you have the telegram group, the Discord channel. But like having all those different mechanism, you can just buy one idea and a few different smart contracts. You can bootstrap an entire idea that will normally take, in traditional finance, couple years to reach. So you can like, yeah, we start like five guys, five people last year, two years ago, and now with like 75 people the companies registered multiple different companies, and we paying high salaries, like governance tokens, participation in all those different projects. So it's fascinating.
00:43:24.714 - 00:44:14.626, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, from my perspective as an american, it's extremely hard to do this correctly and legally. And so one of the downsides to trying to create a DAO within the United States is that the regulatory landscape is so gray and unclear that you actually have a lot of teams leaving the United States to actually do this or having to do this pseudonymously. So I'm not suggesting leave the United States to actually start a DaO. I'm just saying if you are an american, it's one thing you have to consider, is that me and a couple of guys were hacking on a project, actually, in one of the Solana hackathons, and we went two months into talking to lawyers about this, and we got nowhere because it's so difficult to actually do this in a compliant way. And so I think it's actually, you're going to continue to see a rise in pseudonymity with members of daos, especially those for those coming out of the United States.
00:44:14.730 - 00:44:18.634, Speaker C: That's what people do. They build daos in Europe and they raise money in the US.
00:44:18.754 - 00:44:19.574, Speaker F: Exactly.
00:44:19.914 - 00:44:22.058, Speaker C: Perfect. Big money in the US.
00:44:22.146 - 00:44:22.906, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:44:23.050 - 00:45:42.612, Speaker G: I think also, like, the panel title is like, kind of like saying in that way too, right? That everyone right now is in this situation where a lot of people speculate that if you don't move towards this decentralized setup, we might actually die. As a project, you become much more exposed to centralized risk, not only on your team side, but also just from a regulatory standpoint. Everyone needs to think about at what stage are we actually mature enough to move into a full daO structure. For example, what we did at Maker and I thinkmaker is probably the furthest one on this topic here, where you have even the product decisions, where I think a lot of the teams in this space, they have decent decision making in some form, but it's not really there yet where even the community decide the product direction. You would still see a lot of the big teams deciding which products to build, when to release them, and prioritize the development resources. I think from my perspective, and also what we did at Maker was basically saying, at what stage is the product mature enough for us to release it out to the community? What do we need to have built for them to kind of like, take over? So with Maker, it was, you know, releasing and bootstrapping multicollateral die and making sure that they had been running for, I think it was six months or something. Nine months.
00:45:42.612 - 00:46:09.720, Speaker G: Then, of course, March 12 happened, which then made it very clear that we needed a new liquidation system. So that kind of, like, got prioritized. And then, like, once those building stones were put in place, then, you know, they kind of, like, the team and the foundation was at a stage where we could actually release the product back to the community. Right. So that is, like, where we are now, where there's no foundation, there's no centralized corporation. Everyone works directly for the DAO. Everyone gets paid by the DAO to get a job at maker.
00:46:09.720 - 00:46:34.364, Speaker G: Now you basically have to apply to the DAO for them to onboard you. So, yeah, it's like, from my standpoint, it's like you need to figure out at what stage are we mature enough to actually do this? And this is, you know, like, steps on, like, the road of, like, the path towards decentralization, where you use the term gradual decentralization. You shouldn't do it from day one. That will make your life very difficult. But you should definitely look at what stage are we able to actually release this.
00:46:34.824 - 00:46:43.112, Speaker A: Well, I tend to disagree. We tried to launch the Dao before everything, actually. Yeah, it was kind of crazy.
00:46:43.208 - 00:46:44.084, Speaker G: How was it?
00:46:44.504 - 00:47:13.970, Speaker A: Awesome. Really awesome. I mean, it also meant building shit, tons of infrastructure around it. Maybe made a slower and first few steps, I would say, but then it created, like, all these incentives for people who are really, really smart to get into the project and, like, decide this is their thing. We have a hedge fund trader. He's running his own fund and his free time, he's trading on mango. He literally comes home and continues trading with, instead of equities, it's like perpetuals.
00:47:13.970 - 00:48:00.426, Speaker A: And he's giving support while he's at work. I'm just wondering, how in the world could this be possible if it was? Wouldn't have decided to open up right away, even when the product isn't finished yet. Right. While it's still shaping and bringing all these people with different perspectives together, especially from day one, make sure that you don't have this team barrier, which is something we've been always really, really aware as founders, like, the people who start the project. Everyone tells you, oh, you're a founder, but what does it mean, right? Because by now there's so many people working on this project. I hope they're working harder than me, actually, I think most of them do and aren't data founders. Don't they deserve to be called the founders? So what's the point where we say it was founded, right? And I think it starts with the DAO.
00:48:00.426 - 00:48:10.374, Speaker A: It doesn't start with a tech demo or something on GitHub. It's when you actually sit down, decide, okay, this is how it's going to roll, and this is everyone's stake. Right.
00:48:12.094 - 00:48:13.874, Speaker F: And how's that working out for you?
00:48:15.174 - 00:48:51.558, Speaker A: I mean, I would say the part that we kind of messed up was the fair launch part. We tried to do something that gives equal access, but then in the end, you know, it's like, I think it's the same story with Leia wands. It's often not talked about, but there's some actors who are willing to take the risk and go in really early in, really, really high stakes. And that, of course, poses a huge risk to the idea of decentralization, because suddenly you have these mainly financially motivated people who are like 10%, 20% right. Of the voting stake, and you need to figure out how you deal with that.
00:48:51.686 - 00:49:26.474, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what happened to curve finance. Big players trying to take control of the Dow, and it's tough. Yeah. Then you end up with, like, players that playing 40 chess, not necessarily in the interest of the Dow, but more in the economical interest for themselves. So that's why it's dangerous to Dao is like, people getting involved in the dao. They're not necessarily having the same vision as you, as a. As a builder, as building the project.
00:49:26.474 - 00:50:06.524, Speaker C: It doesn't necessarily mean that they know they don't have a great vision or they know actually pushing the product for the best of the product. But most of the time, in this ecosystem, people are pushed for economical reasons. And so it's very likely that people that have a huge, huge stake in the protocol will short term or medium term, sell the asset and try to make it. Sure. So then they can jump into another project. So that's why my personal experience, building a DAO is good. But having a fully decentralized dao from day, from day one, I haven't seen any dao that's successfully made it.
00:50:06.524 - 00:50:35.418, Speaker C: So in a DaO, you need strong leadership. And also after the DAO is like, kind of like fully decentralized, you still need strong leadership. Even if those people that wait their voice online have hold stake and shares in the protocol. Because people, it's good to say, like people, they understand the vision, they understand how to push the product, but most of the time, 99% of those people are more like incentivized by the money.
00:50:35.466 - 00:50:38.970, Speaker G: So, yeah, I mean, you can also have, like, a lot of different shapes of a DaO.
00:50:39.002 - 00:50:39.146, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:39.170 - 00:51:09.610, Speaker G: Like I'm like a big supporter of like delegates as well as like domain experts. So you know, you would, you would have like in like for example, like at mango markets, you would probably need people who's like experts within like trading or like derivatives, like auction methods. And I would say like from my perspective, I think, you know, like putting like extra responsibility over to like people who get voted in by the rest or like delegated tokens too because you trusted like their work, their expert opinion. I think that works better than having like a completely open voting process, right?
00:51:09.682 - 00:51:31.174, Speaker C: Yeah, but you can still, you can still build a layer of bribing on top of it. Of course, then the people that bribe, tell or direct like incentivize governance decision in such a way that will incentivize the delegates to delegate in that specific path. And at the end you just like have an extra layer on top of an extra layer and then govern the Dow.
00:51:31.294 - 00:51:43.274, Speaker G: Yeah, I mean like, of course, like influencing delegates or something like that can always happen. But of course, like hopefully you would be able to spot it at some point and people would hopefully remove their delegation from them.
00:51:43.654 - 00:51:50.794, Speaker C: No, because they will make more money for them. Yeah, it's like the situation at the moment with convex and curve.
00:51:51.494 - 00:51:53.862, Speaker G: Curve is also like a very special example. Right.
00:51:53.918 - 00:52:11.968, Speaker C: Well, like in, I think it's gitcoin or like ens. Now they're starting to think about introducing rewards for the delegates. But easy, you can just like build and incentivize it civilization program that will just direct the DAO to do certain things.
00:52:12.136 - 00:52:40.708, Speaker F: Yeah, I have a question actually. So going back to Max's point around the IDO and around trying to think of mechanisms that you can have fair distribution of these governance tokens so that you actually perhaps get a spread out participation across the field. Now that you did the way that you went and you guys have seen other models, have you thought on ways that you could have done a better model of token distribution for the DAO? Or like what do you guys as well well think are interesting ways to actually have a fair distribution of DAO tokens? Max, if you'd like to start, I.
00:52:40.716 - 00:52:52.064, Speaker A: Mean, we thought the whole time maybe we should just do an airdrop to everyone who got liquidated. Kind of like. Yeah, but then maybe that's not the smartest people to start with.
00:52:54.204 - 00:52:55.264, Speaker F: That's cold.
00:52:57.564 - 00:53:28.672, Speaker A: I don't know, it's really, really tricky. Fundamentally you're trying to solve like you don't want to give like huge stake to people who never going to contribute back, right? So you want to incentivize people who are actually really active by themselves. You also want to give them the power to change the project in the direction. Because usually the knowledge sits on the outside, right. It sits where people are actually working, doing the work, seeing the code, talking with the customer, it's not necessarily in the, you know, VC office.
00:53:28.768 - 00:53:29.000, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:29.032 - 00:53:30.648, Speaker A: But the strategy is decided.
00:53:30.776 - 00:53:36.624, Speaker F: Like, how do you do that? Like it's clear who deserves the tokens. Like, how do you make sure those people get the tokens?
00:53:36.784 - 00:54:16.844, Speaker A: Our plan still is that there's a huge part of the treasury on spend and we're just going to distribute it, hopefully mercilessly to developers. I personally would love that, but unfortunately there's no more opinions than the DAO. But I think if we, if we keep the spirit of like just overpaying people and governance tokens purely, that means that people have a very long term vision for the project when they accept this kind of reimbursement. And if we manage to distribute it in a way that really the, I would say top 100 people that built this project, right. The people who really committed their lives in the end are large owners of it. That would be ideal, Joe?
00:54:17.664 - 00:55:01.948, Speaker F: Well, I mean, I'll say I may or may not have participated in the public sale. So I actually thought it was brilliant. I thought it was really fair for outsiders that actually weren't actively participating in mango, because if you saw Mango and the path the product was actually taking, it felt like there was cohesion amongst the people that were actually building it. And you could see that the roadmap was, excuse me, going to be creating even better features, a better experience for trading perpetuals, joining your spot, trading, et cetera, et cetera. And so I felt like this is something I want to actually support irrespective of how the price actually maps out. It's ultimately, of course, gone up in value because you have more and more people using it. More and more people are evangelizing it.
00:55:01.948 - 00:55:21.624, Speaker F: I'm evangelizing it. I think it's actually a great product. So I actually think it was a fair approach to actually distributing tokens on the public sale. That's different, I think, than how you would actually distribute them with people within the DAO. Myself being a software developer for a long time, I think the people that are actually doing the work are the ones that should be getting compensated the most.
00:55:23.564 - 00:56:05.568, Speaker G: Don't you think? If you overcompensate people who are the contributors to a DAo, don't you think that you would end up in a situation where you have not just a concentration of the tokens to that team, but also the team, that is the easiest for them to collude because all of them are in the same chat channels like Slack, discord, whatever you use, telegram, they know each other, they build this project together, and they're also like now probably at least the majority of the largest token holders. That is the easiest way to create a concentration of power that would exclude the external community to maybe want to participate, because now the majority of voting power lies within the team structure. How do you avoid that?
00:56:05.616 - 00:56:26.848, Speaker F: Well, I was going to say, what do you suggest is an alternative? On the one hand, if people are going to be actively contributing, shouldn't they be getting compensated? On the other hand, if they're going to be to the tier point, could potentially be colluding because there's a group of ten x developers that all get together and they have this large chunk of the treasury. Well, how do you, what's the alternative to that?
00:56:26.896 - 00:56:46.974, Speaker A: Well, I really like actually the model you guys are doing. I think Mango will transition into that. We can't do it like from day one because I think for most people it's too spooky. I don't expect anyone who met me in Lisbon to go and found a Delaware corporation and apply for a grant from the DAO. I think.
00:56:47.314 - 00:56:49.242, Speaker F: What is that model that Max is mentioning?
00:56:49.338 - 00:58:11.450, Speaker G: Yeah, so, I mean, so at mega right now, we have kind of like two parts of it, right? There's of course, like the compensation where, like right now actually, I'm not sure if the MKR vesting is live for the contributors yet, but, you know, like you get paid directly by the DAO, like everyone, everything is out in the open, very transparent. And then we also have a governance process, like a governance method and setup where we actually, I wouldn't say remove the power from the token holders, but reduce the power from the token holders. Most of the governance process is actually done without the need to have any significant amount of tokens. We of course have on chain polling where you need tokens, and on chain voting in the end, like the executive vote, where something passes where you need tokens, but whatever ends up in both the poll and in the executive vote in the end is defined in a preterm process. So there you can actually, we have tried to build a setup where you can eliminate the strong hand that in most of the governance systems we see today, where they are heavily reliant on token voting as the significant truth. And what actually gets put in you can only make a post if you have tokens and then it goes to voting, and if you have a lot of tokens, you can just pass it through. So instead we have a different process where the power of the token itself is removed from the governance structure.
00:58:11.642 - 00:58:13.814, Speaker F: Thank you, Julian. Any thoughts on this?
00:58:14.314 - 00:59:42.470, Speaker C: Well, I've got one or two stories fair launch. The problem is, what we experience is so in token, like in product, you have yield farming, but you also have like contributors farming. So what happened is like when you launch a project, you will find some people like anonymous, and they contribute to your project, but the intention is just to grab like this kind of fairlance tokens and acquire a lot of shares, but then they disappear. And this happened a lot of different projects that I've met and also personally and also like, you have this, I mean, rewriting a story like on rect, but you also have some entities in the world that are specialized in this like kind of like scamming entities that basically specialize in early stage projects to acquire percentage of the governance, and then they either disappear or they dump or like they threaten the project. So it's difficult that to select the back then we had like Merkel trees, airdrops type of things for gitcoin community, for people that participating in the governance of projects. But what you realize is that most of the time those people are not actually contributing back to your project. You can track those addresses and they're like, they had an airdrop, they contribute, they vote into curve, or they vote into Aave or maker.
00:59:42.470 - 01:00:00.454, Speaker C: But the reason for that is they either got incentivized to do so, or they were bribed by someone and then they completely disappear. So, yeah, I mean, for me, dao, without strong leadership from start, it's kind of like difficult. And we've seen it in a PA, in a place like a lot.
01:00:03.154 - 01:00:23.166, Speaker G: Touch upon another really good point, which is also something you're like, if you're incentivized to participate in governance, if you paid for the actual vote itself, that also just leads to much poorer outcomes for the project itself. You should never incentivize people to vote because then people would just vote without actually necessarily knowing what they vote for, care about what they vote for.
01:00:23.230 - 01:00:26.094, Speaker C: The entire Defi is turning into bribing.
01:00:26.254 - 01:01:15.214, Speaker G: Yeah, we held a workshop with a lot of the Cosmos validators on Sunday governance workshop, where they say that they have a similar problem now, where if there's a vote out, for example, which is something that the people staking to them think is what they should vote for, but they actually want to vote opposite because it's better for the network. Well, if they go against the people delegating their stake to them, they will actually remove their stake. This is another example where you kind of have this, we have to vote this way, or we have to do a vote that we don't even think is the best, or we just vote because we're incentivized to do so. And that actually creates very, very poor decision making. So you should be very careful around implementing economic incentives around voting itself, because it would just lead to very poor decision making. Because people would just have to vote because they're getting paid.
01:01:15.254 - 01:01:15.454, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:15.494 - 01:01:17.634, Speaker G: Without necessarily being interested in the vote itself.
01:01:18.654 - 01:01:24.274, Speaker A: How many times did you have to text a whale on Telegram, be like, hey, you need to vote on this?
01:01:28.854 - 01:01:30.538, Speaker C: You see, we have the same experience.
01:01:30.686 - 01:01:31.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:34.074 - 01:02:05.294, Speaker F: I have a somewhat specific question. This is something Max and I have talked about a ton, and I'd love to hear if people have ideas. So part of the issue is, if you want to incentivize DAO members with locked tokens, if those tokens already have a high enough valuation upon reception of them, depending on the tax laws of the places those people are, it's taxed as income. So if you give someone a million dollars, perhaps they have 300k they have to pay, but they can't sell those tokens to pay. What are some mechanisms in which you can actually use locked tokens to incentivize DAO members? Or does it just have to be unlocked?
01:02:09.074 - 01:02:10.698, Speaker A: I wish I could give taxes.
01:02:10.746 - 01:02:12.202, Speaker F: None of us are lawyers or tax.
01:02:12.258 - 01:02:16.094, Speaker A: People, so we're like, we're scared it's being recording.
01:02:17.114 - 01:02:18.058, Speaker F: Fair enough.
01:02:18.226 - 01:02:28.550, Speaker A: If someone knows about it, I mean, if anyone knows, please come. We all have a problem. Okay, sorry.
01:02:28.582 - 01:02:56.264, Speaker F: So transitioning out of that one. But that is something that needs to be solved. There needs to be a way to be able to incentivize people in daos with lock tokens. Would you guys say then, like, from what you're saying, even though the DAO could be a programmatic structure, initially, at the end, like any human thing involved, it depends on integrity more than like. I guess my question here is, what's more important? Like, powerful leadership as far as someone that can bring and have guidance and a vision, or just having a group of people that may not have that much vision, but all have integrity and trust between each other.
01:02:56.884 - 01:04:01.994, Speaker G: So I think also, I think from my perspective, whenever we talk about dials, a lot of people think, oh, we are going to create this community, it's got to be only amazingly smart people and we're going to end up with better decision making. And it just very rarely happens if you have a small internal team that the true experts, they will almost always take better decisions than the community. You can have really smart people coming in, in the community, of course, but it will also be like a lot of noise, people who have a very different perspective than you, or a different view. What is even the best objective outcome. It's all about which direction we're going into. So the way that I often see at Dao, and especially what we also see with Maker, I don't know if you guys have been following the drama that's been there lately, but with the whole delegates, these people who take on these roles, where they are facilitators of some kind of vertical or programming, I often think that it shares bigger similarities to a democracy. They become protocol politicians and they're having to govern the system rather than being directors and managers in a company.
01:04:01.994 - 01:04:10.074, Speaker G: For me, it's much more similar to a political system than to a company structure often.
01:04:10.814 - 01:04:51.534, Speaker F: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think one of the things that cryptocurrency has done is that it's digitally enabled a concept that's been around for thousands of years, which is something we've all made up, which is money. And now daos have more or less digitally enabled politics or governance. And I think that there's ramifications that we're just not fully aware of yet. I think the incentives piece around, if you're going to be getting paid for this in a token that has value, well, politicians also get paid. And so there's going to be that kind of tension, but it's going to be in a decentralized, pseudonymous or anonymous way. So we're basically taking some of the stuff that's happened in kind of the real life world of politics and applying it into a decentralized environment.
01:04:54.074 - 01:04:54.854, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:04:55.474 - 01:04:56.682, Speaker A: Any thoughts or. No?
01:04:56.778 - 01:05:12.870, Speaker C: Well, I mean, like, it's, it's funny because before, like Defi and people in blockchain, they were chasing money. But then over the past year, now they're chasing lobbying. And lobbying now is starting to be more important than money because you can lobby, is money?
01:05:12.902 - 01:05:13.358, Speaker G: No.
01:05:13.486 - 01:06:02.516, Speaker C: Well, the thing is like if you have lobby, you can direct money, but if you have money, you don't necessarily have lobby. So what's happening now is like all this new platform being built for bribing, incentivizing people to do certain, direct, certain things. Because what we realize is when you have a stake in maker or stake in curve or stake in Aave and all different things, those people that want to build on top of it. If you think about it, a project might have a tvl of 20 billion or 30 billion, but at the end of day, what you want is to be connected to that project because you want to tap into that liquidity. You want to build on top of it. So the most important aspect is not actually how much money you raise because you will never be able to buy with the money. If you raise $20 million or $30 million, it's very unlikely that you can actually get yourself inside this protocol.
01:06:02.516 - 01:06:56.926, Speaker C: What really counts is how many people will vote for you to get inside this protocol. So then the only way for you to get listed inside this protocol to build on top of it, because we're talking about lending market, auto market maker, the basically the infrastructure of the entire traditional finance. What we're currently building is not new. And you say like before it was a thousand years ago there was money, but whatever we're seeing in the DeFi space, it's just that copy past of the traditional finance, financial products, but with a different stack or different technology. And now what's happening is, as you mentioned, it's like the European Commission is like Europe. You have parliament, you have the European Commission, you have lobby around those big projects that then if you have sufficient power, sufficient lobbying, you can basically tell, okay, you can get listed, I will incentivize you to, to get there. You basically control the entire defi.
01:06:56.926 - 01:07:06.554, Speaker C: And that's what is fascinating at the same, but at the same time is very scary because now it's not a question of money, it's a question of governance, of lobbying. It's happening.
01:07:06.934 - 01:07:22.864, Speaker F: Well, thank you so much to all of you. I actually am going to extend an invitation to perhaps do a podcast episode because I think we all touched on a lot of problems and it'd be good to do an hour on solutions to these problems and then perhaps people can learn from that. I appreciate your time here. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you to everyone.
01:07:28.884 - 01:07:29.664, Speaker A: Cool.
01:07:37.164 - 01:08:21.864, Speaker D: All right, welcome back. We are going to continue with a focus on NFTs and gaming, which is, you know, you might be not surprised to have guessed that's what we're doing today. Again, big focus on growth, next opportunity areas and stuff that's now in the stage where there's early traction, but you can see the path to it becoming a large part of the ecosystem. And one of these interesting things is of course like a lot of projects now, especially stuff that's launching on Solana. They're using NFTs maybe as almost a fundraising mechanism to go and support a game or some other expanded universe instead of activities that comes out of that. Sometimes that's a universe creation, a metaverse. Sometimes that's a more traditional, I say more traditional, a more traditional web3 game.
01:08:21.864 - 01:08:33.984, Speaker D: So we're going to talk a little bit more about that today, and we'll bring up the next panel on NFTs and the games within games. So tired.
01:08:37.124 - 01:08:38.084, Speaker A: Up to you. Up to you.
01:08:38.124 - 01:09:09.760, Speaker B: All right, so very appropriate. As we wind down the conference, we're gonna talk about winding up your game. I'll just start off with Albert here. Just games have evolved and how we've, we've monetized, you know, from box sales to subscriptions to free to play. And that's opened up a lot of, like, early sales through Kickstarter and other things. Now that we have these wide open possibilities with cryptocurrency, can you kind of describe what, you know, nfts and initial game monetization. How is that changing?
01:09:09.872 - 01:09:43.999, Speaker H: Yeah. So traditionally you have to launch the game first, and then you can monetize your in game content. With nfts, it's changed a lot. So without having to build a game first, you can build a community first and have nfts out there that you can sell. That's why we're seeing all these NFT drops. And on top of getting sales off of the NFT drops, you can make money off the transaction fees. I think that's the biggest breakthrough of nfts because it's changing the model from the game developer making all the money to creators and other players.
01:09:43.999 - 01:09:59.772, Speaker H: So we were able to do that for genopets, even just with our initial airdrop. We dropped these eggs to our early adopters for free, and they're trading openly on FTX, us and on Solanart, and that's generating transaction fees for us. So it's been pretty cool to see.
01:09:59.868 - 01:10:14.948, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you raise a really interesting point where you're already getting real traction and you're starting to see, before you even launch your game, kind of what is resonating with players. Can you describe maybe how valuable that is while you're developing the game? Before you even have to develop a.
01:10:14.956 - 01:10:43.408, Speaker H: Lot of the game mechanics that you're seeing, it's flipped the model completely on its head. Right. So a lot of times, I think also in traditional industries, too, you spend a lot of time building something that you think people will like, and then you ship it. Maybe it's not 100% what people like. And then what you end up having to do is like refine it. But then the way we have it going on with NFT games is that you build a community first and then you ship a very minimal game and then have the community help you build. Build it alongside.
01:10:43.576 - 01:11:06.864, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I'm getting into that. The weeds of this community here. So like gamers, we're just gonna gamify everything, you know? And maybe the more realistic way of saying that is we're going to try to break everything to our own game, maybe. Sharaf, can you just talk a little bit about how you think about that? And how do you launch effectively while, you know, keeping things really positive and set your game up for success?
01:11:07.284 - 01:12:03.304, Speaker A: Maybe to set some context. What we're doing with monkey Ball launching on Solana this Christmas, it's a new easy esport game, essentially sits somewhere in the intersection between FIFA street and Final Fantasy. Maybe like role play with the soccer theme. So the essential parts of the game are of course, the in game currency and there are recipes of how to do a proper ido in a way that suits everybody. Right? And everybody will try to game this, but I mean, we kind of ahead of the curve with that right now. And then there's the NFT draw because you do want players to be able to access the game right away and start playing. So how do you avoid the obvious pitfalls in that? Like someone having too many nfts or just trying to, you know, pay to win all the way? So it's baked in the game mechanics.
01:12:03.304 - 01:12:34.802, Speaker A: What we're doing with monkey ball is essentially a fair launch in the sense of the NFT drop. So it's the same price for everybody. You can only buy a set amount of nfts and there are ways to counter bugs, like setting up a lot of candy machines. That was Joe McCann's idea. And whitelisting. So there are ways to control that. And then because it's the same price, we do not try to capture all the value.
01:12:34.802 - 01:12:37.434, Speaker A: The value will be determined on secondary.
01:12:37.474 - 01:12:38.850, Speaker B: Marketplaces by the community.
01:12:38.962 - 01:12:41.934, Speaker A: By the community as they see fit.
01:12:42.434 - 01:13:07.750, Speaker B: Yeah, let's get to that community. I think it's fascinating to see how the communities can both form naturally, both in determining the value of everything. So I'm just going to open this up to the floor here. Just like how we're seeing Dow creation and refined guilds versus very fly by the ceiling pants guilds. What are we seeing? How communities around games are really leveraging these drops and coming together really early on in the development.
01:13:07.902 - 01:13:46.274, Speaker H: Well, I think a huge part of any gaming, even traditional gaming, is this whole concept of status. That's the metagame above everything, even social networks and gaming. And I think NFT just brings that to the forefront of it. So people want to get their first. If the narrative of the game really resonates with them, then you form a community around that and then people want to be experts in it and they'll start creating content with it. They'll start going for the NFT drops first and they want to own all the NFTs that's related to the game. And that's what we've been seeing about how the community is building up, at least for us.
01:13:47.094 - 01:14:17.056, Speaker A: Simply put, I think NFTs allow more fun to be brought into gaming. Yes, it's a about bringing the community in earlier and deeper into the entire experience from start to finish. So, you know, those are now maybe exploring gaming for the first time through nfTs. You know, they're able to experience something unlike any other. So I think it's all about, you know, bringing some more fun. It also brings flex. Right? Like, I own a very powerful character, maybe for the game.
01:14:17.056 - 01:14:38.274, Speaker A: Like, I have very good stats. It's not just beautiful, I have very good stats in the game. I own the. I can put this, you know, on my profile. I can show my friends. I mean, my kids will not pay a lot for brands, like wearing brands, but if they can flex with this sort of character, then they will pay for it. I mean, I will pay for it, but they would like this.
01:14:38.854 - 01:14:39.142, Speaker H: Yeah.
01:14:39.158 - 01:15:04.944, Speaker B: I remember my experience being just like on the early side of gaming, it typically was just forums and discords, communities kind of speaking with developers. But having actual content of the game this early on in game development, I feel like the flexibility of NFTs where I can add on my own stuff on chain and just be like, hey, developer, this thing I made, maybe you should probably use it in the game. Are we seeing any of that yet? Are we seeing how you can have the creator economy?
01:15:05.064 - 01:15:05.368, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:15:05.416 - 01:15:33.954, Speaker H: So a huge part of it is that NFTs are basically metadata that's stored somewhere. And we're seeing some people taking that metadata and interpreting it their own way and creating new content and new characters on it. And that's like the beauty of nfts and also just blockchain gaming. It's the composability of it. And we're also talking to other projects where our characters or our nfts can appear in their game in some form or the other. So it creates this really open standard of gaming that's really exciting.
01:15:34.654 - 01:15:59.662, Speaker A: I think we are a bit early on for that, to be honest. I mean, for high production value games like, like we are putting on, the experience should need to be at least a bit curated. Right. So I don't see this happening right now, at least for us, but maybe after a while. I mean, I don't think YouTube could have succeeded that much with user generated content if that was the first thing happening in the world.
01:15:59.718 - 01:15:59.958, Speaker F: Right.
01:16:00.006 - 01:16:08.034, Speaker A: We had high production films and studios and then it happened. So I think this is probably better order. But we are very early on.
01:16:08.154 - 01:16:28.974, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really interesting point. So how do we think about the evolution of this? So we start, we kind of set the stage here. We have initial drop, the evolution of the community. How do you keep them engaged? Maybe you have opportunities for other drops and evolution of your content. Can you maybe speak about how are you thinking about these communities evolving and keeping them engaged?
01:16:30.694 - 01:16:31.166, Speaker H: Sorry.
01:16:31.230 - 01:17:15.476, Speaker A: I'm really excited for games towards the end of its life cycle perhaps, and how nfts have evolved from start to near finish. I think we're now seeing nfts at play in terms of before the game launch, in game characters. But as nfts add more utility, more value as the game comes to end of its life cycle, I think there's going to be a lot more creativity there to not only engage them back into the game, but even postgame. Well, what else can they do with the NFT, you know, outside the game? Two different areas, I think, that I'm really excited about. Yeah, I mean, I like what Fortnite is actually doing, you know, with the additions and the seasons and all of that. So we're definitely bringing that into play. So, like, we're gonna have limited content.
01:17:15.476 - 01:17:35.514, Speaker A: Like when you breed two of our monkeys in the. In the game, over time, there may be like a set period of time in which certain genes can pop up and create unique characters that will only be available at that season and cannot be created afterwards. And that brings a lot of rarity to things and collectible ideas.
01:17:35.814 - 01:18:00.454, Speaker B: That makes sense. I mean, you're producing soccer games, so there's obviously a lot of corollary, the real world where you do seasons in there. So it's like, yeah, what do you think about the player's interaction with that? Like their life cycle? Do you expect there to be these, I don't know, maybe governance periods even? And they self form, kind of like, okay, this is the preseason stage. We do this kind of team formation versus this stage. Or have you seen any of that? Kind of.
01:18:01.194 - 01:18:27.718, Speaker A: I think this will happen. And I think actually guilds can, can push a lot of that because these are like, you know, unions of sorts and then that kind of automatically can bring this into place. Or we're thinking about creating, you know, certain content that will cater certain guilds. Or like, if you have this boots, gaming boots on, then you're part of this guild, but only if you're part of this guild, you can have these boots on and have like a special bonus when, like, accuracy bonus.
01:18:27.846 - 01:18:29.934, Speaker B: So do you deserve the boots?
01:18:30.094 - 01:18:31.118, Speaker A: You deserve the boot.
01:18:31.166 - 01:18:50.152, Speaker B: Yeah, I can imagine, like this off season training thing going on too. Like this is the training season. This is in season. This is like, yeah, playoffs. And I think that's really interesting how that can evolve with blockchain histories. Can we, can we think? Because right now it's not just this monetization factor. It's everything is public and being built off of.
01:18:50.152 - 01:19:02.856, Speaker B: We have the distinct season not just through an API, but it's just sitting there queryable anytime by anybody. Can you think about how we can leverage that or have you been leveraging that when you think about it?
01:19:02.880 - 01:19:25.024, Speaker H: Yeah, I mean, one of the ways we're leveraging that is just having our nfts be mutable. So there are other nfts that can come in and mutate the state of your metadata and allow you to create other nfts with it. That and also the composability aspect that I was talking about with other games building on top of it, which may be a ways away, but that's another way if that could happen.
01:19:27.324 - 01:19:59.994, Speaker B: Yeah, the mutability, and I think there's like that, you know, cryptokitty hats was kind of like the first things where somebody built on top of it. There's also just kind of all the stats and different combinations you can do. Have you thought about how, like, you know, the players being able to even self form different sub tournaments or sub activities, you know, and really taking like, modulating even like, the core competitive aspects of the different games? Have you thought about that as you've formed your ideas?
01:20:00.114 - 01:20:01.338, Speaker H: Right, so, yeah, go ahead.
01:20:01.386 - 01:20:29.586, Speaker A: We thought about these sort of modes and like, allowing, you know, players to create their own interactions. And again, I think we're pretty early on, like, you want to do one thing very good, like the, you know, the storytelling of how the game is happening and the seasons and everything. Once that's done and people actually love the game now. I think they'll be more comfortable with creating their own meta games within the game.
01:20:29.690 - 01:20:50.078, Speaker H: Yeah, I agree with that. And I think we're creating the groundwork and the framework for how that could happen. But just like dao governance, as they were talking about before, I think in the beginning the game developer will take a huge responsibility in that. And as the game matures, then you start opening it up for community governance and meta games being built that way.
01:20:50.166 - 01:21:18.654, Speaker A: Yeah, you should probably think of it like an App Store, right? Remember the first App Store in Apple? You didn't even have that. You just had Apple's apps and you saw how this whole thing works, you understood it. And then it's open for developers to create things. So a game is not an open source technology project that people can just create anything out of. If you give them a curated experience, they'll get it and they'll know what missing, maybe even better than you, and try to innovate on top of that.
01:21:18.954 - 01:21:34.414, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about a little more, like maybe what's missing? What are the kind of the risks here when you're. So we kind of went through the whole life cycle of launch into, like, how do you keep that engagement? What are the risks? Maybe even at day one, how can you set that? How can we avoid failure? And, like, what are the risks of failure?
01:21:35.474 - 01:21:48.720, Speaker H: So for me, I think just don't be too opinionated into anything and be nimble about how your community responds to it. Then be, you know, be open to change. I think that's the way I would approach it.
01:21:48.792 - 01:22:30.380, Speaker A: I would say to begin with, everything that is, you know, player versus player, team versus team. The major problem to begin with is liquidity. Actually, even if you look at big games, the matching server, I mean, can take you like a full two minutes to find other players. And this is, you know, PlayStation five with the entire community. It can take a while, right? So with this, it's a risk. So if you don't take care of the inflation of game assets and allowing multiple players to concurrently find each other on time, then you're at the risk of a very bad experience. So probably makes sense to begin with player versus environment, allow some breeding and then do PvP.
01:22:30.380 - 01:22:55.876, Speaker A: But we try to think of things, you know, ten years from now of the economy. The simulations that we run are at a ten year interval and we're trying to think backwards about, hey, maybe there'll be a certain time, you know, where there are too many characters out there. And the value just decreases. So how do we deflate the economy? Like how do we retire players? Like what's the next phase? That makes sense.
01:22:55.980 - 01:23:14.208, Speaker B: I mean, you're bringing up some really interesting points. Programs on a blockchain are immutable. How do you think about, in that world, being able to pivot, being able to adjust some of the, you know, is it configuration parameters? Is it, you know, updates to programs? Can we. Yeah. How have you been thinking about that as you, as you evolve your games?
01:23:14.296 - 01:23:39.476, Speaker H: Well, to start, most of the gaming logic is not, is on centralized servers to start and will gradually move on to blockchain logic. I think that's, that's a good way. I'm not a proponent of having all gaming logic on chain to start with. First, because of performance reasons, and obviously second, for most games and most, even most products, you don't know where you're going to end up. That's my thought.
01:23:39.620 - 01:24:13.754, Speaker A: I totally agree. And I think blockchain should add value and not just create limitations. So if the whole concept is just setting us, locking us in a space where we cannot innovate anymore, then, then we've obviously done the wrong thing. And this is why we have the Daos, right? I think any game should have a Dao and the code should be flexible enough that you can change the contracts with the agreement of the Dao of, hey, this is how we want to play the game. And if it suits everybody, because it makes sense, by all means.
01:24:14.374 - 01:24:41.766, Speaker B: So let's take a look into the future. That Dao comment really got me thinking. Five years from now, after games launch and things, there's going to be existing daos out there, existing guilds that have some NFTs in their market. How does the NFT launch change? If I'm in development right now, I know I'm going to release in three years. How should I be thinking about my launch? Given that world where there's going to be existing guilds out there with existing content, how do I merge my content with that content?
01:24:41.910 - 01:25:16.464, Speaker H: Well, a thing that we've been doing, first of all, it's still really early on, so it's hard to say how that's going to play out in three years. But today what we're doing with guilds is that we are inviting them into our game and we're doing co branded in game assets with them that they can use with their scholars. And I'd imagine in three years where the space is way more saturated, you would have to do way more curated experiences. And then the guilds will get to pick. And unless you make your offer very compelling, then you might not be able to compete in this market.
01:25:16.844 - 01:25:28.692, Speaker A: Well, first, I agree that it's impossible to predict what we'll do in five years because, you know, five years ago we didn't even have defi, I think, let alone NFT games and the metaverse. Right.
01:25:28.788 - 01:25:29.764, Speaker B: Barely had free to play.
01:25:29.844 - 01:26:08.384, Speaker A: Yeah. So, so it's, it's, it's quite impossible. So what you. So how do you prepare for the unknown? Right, well, first of all, you need to avoid making big mistakes like locking some vectors or locking some things that cannot be changed forever that will set you on the wrong course over five years. You should probably avoid all of that. With that in mind, you should probably run all sorts of simulations of different scenarios and how things can change and merge and be composable enough to adjust survival of the fetus. That's why what it is, right, you need to adjust over time.
01:26:08.384 - 01:26:09.716, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:26:09.740 - 01:26:24.108, Speaker B: Something I thought about here was the technology built on this. Can you talk a little bit about what technology gaps are out there right now and kind of what is going to enable developers to release with confidence more from a technology perspective, do you think?
01:26:24.236 - 01:26:57.414, Speaker A: I think given that all things web3 are still very early, there's a lot more that I think communities do to help each other understand, educate each other, so that we all as one can grow stronger and fill in gaps as needed. Right. I mean, I don't think one company or one blockchain can do it all. I think it requires really the power of everyone. But as that moves forward, I think it's also our duty to help the gaming community understand how web3 can be leveraged in a positive way, in an efficient way. But I'm hoping that happens sooner than later.
01:26:58.534 - 01:27:24.794, Speaker B: Something we've seen from web two, kind of like on a technology perspective, is all these drop mechanics with traditional drops on twitch or through content creators. And we've started to see that in the Defi world. A lot of it's done in the Gamefi world, but it hasn't really reached mainstream content creation yet. How do you think that evolves? Because it seems to be some pretty obvious synergies there as it becomes more normal.
01:27:25.714 - 01:27:44.346, Speaker H: I think it's slowly starting to slowly happen already. I mean, the mainstream audience is always going to be a little slower to the innovations of crypto, but from what I've seen, we're getting a lot of calls from traditional brands and events that want to do co branded launches and stuff. So I think moving forward, that's just going to get bigger and bigger.
01:27:44.530 - 01:28:14.110, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And there's a lot of hype around the games, right. And all the gaming studios, the major gaming studios are all fairly interested in what's going on and experimenting. And I think one issue that we see is that all the listed companies, the big ones, can't really handle crypto. I mean, if they're listed in the US, can't really handle this part easily. I mean, the legal team will be like, we do not touch crypto. Right? So they invest in things and they call and they ask.
01:28:14.110 - 01:28:51.554, Speaker A: So I definitely see this, this involved, I think, you know, we used to think like, one of our investors is Morgan Beller. She was the co founder of, co creator of Libra in Facebook. And she said, we used to think that stable coins will be the thing that brings, you know, the next hundred million people to crypto. And we now think it's games, actually. And I do see this happen with all the usual burden of keys and, and the barriers of entry that are super high right now. But this will evolve. I mean, we already see NPC wallets and ways that are just easier.
01:28:51.554 - 01:28:57.354, Speaker A: So I do see this as the way that 100 million new people come into crypto.
01:28:58.174 - 01:29:07.046, Speaker B: Games always been kind of tech forward. Gpu's don't exist because of AI machine learning models or crypto.
01:29:07.230 - 01:29:07.734, Speaker G: It's games.
01:29:07.774 - 01:29:42.816, Speaker H: Yeah, I wanted to add to that, actually, to the user adoption thing. Since gaming has come along, a lot of my traditional finance friends who refuse to touch crypto beforehand are now all into nfts and stuff. They're in discords using like cool usernames that I'm like. Usually they're in a suit with their full names, super formal. And I feel like, especially as a millennial, this is who we are inside. When we are in our teens, we're playing World of Warcraft, or we were playing, you know, any games. We had an identity online that was separate from our real life identity.
01:29:42.816 - 01:30:03.460, Speaker H: And then when we got into the workforce, you know, we got the traditional world got us to where we are today. And all of a sudden gaming and nfts told us, hey, you can, you can be who you always were on the inside. And I'm seeing this with all my friends who are in traditional finance that's embracing this is who they've always been this whole time. So 100% to add to that, games.
01:30:03.572 - 01:30:41.202, Speaker A: Thanks to nfTs, are truly bringing the masses, I think of it as a trojan horse, into crypto. They don't quite realize it but I mean, we all know they're coming into crypto that way. Right. So I think it's a very novel way for us as a community to bring fun and bring fun into the masses, but also bring them into our crypto world. I've been in this sort of event for like five years now, so hundreds of events. And what you see over time is that with nfts, the audience changed a bit. I think NFts brought more sort of culture pop art into the space.
01:30:41.202 - 01:30:46.850, Speaker A: You see kind of different people letting in right now. More girls. Yeah.
01:30:46.882 - 01:30:47.770, Speaker H: Not just nerds like us.
01:30:47.802 - 01:30:54.198, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's a beautiful thing. I mean, it brought in other types of cultures into creative crypto.
01:30:54.286 - 01:31:03.238, Speaker B: Right. And that's got to be affecting the way that you're doing your initial drops, too, because you're, well, I had this segment of, you know, crypto speculators. Now I just want people who want bling, you know?
01:31:03.326 - 01:31:03.550, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:31:03.582 - 01:31:06.754, Speaker B: Is that really affecting the way you're marketing and choosing your distribution?
01:31:07.174 - 01:31:24.414, Speaker H: I think for me it just makes it so that you're talking in more of a mainstream marketing way, which is more comfortable for marketing anyway. Prior to this, you have to talk to a very specific audience with a very specific crypto knowledge. And it's actually more comforting for me to be able to market to mainstream audience.
01:31:27.754 - 01:32:04.716, Speaker A: I actually understand why we want to have new people joining the space through these drops. But to be honest, as a marketeer, it makes less sense for me right now to do Facebook advertising instead of focusing on communities that I know that are my audience right now. And then let maybe, you know, Facebook slash meta bring in the masses, because market education is a super expensive endeavor. Right. The sort of companies that sponsor the Olympics are in charge of doing that. We're in charge of providing. That's a great point.
01:32:04.740 - 01:32:35.784, Speaker B: That's actually something I've been talking to a lot of people about at the conference this week, is that when you bring in value that you own, you're basically buying a bunch of. You're not buying people buying in as influencers. They're incentivized, not just for more fun people to play the game with, they're more people to bring in an economy that you're facilitating through blockchain. Have you thought about that when these discord conversations probably have a little bit different than they were five years ago as you're starting your games.
01:32:37.584 - 01:33:12.276, Speaker A: I try to think of us, without being presumptuous, as sort of a government of a new nation that tries to set an economy that everybody enjoys. So I don't think of what we do as revenue generation. I'm just trying to create an economy that everybody loves, enjoys and that can flourish. And if it flourishes, then I have my cut of it. And that's my incentive. And I'm super happy about this. But not as an limited company with a sum zero game.
01:33:12.276 - 01:33:25.224, Speaker A: Right? Whatever you paid, I collected. It's not that, it's. I'm setting an economy, I'm setting all the rules. Everything should be tipped up and then people love it and then I get my cuts because I'm part of this economy.
01:33:25.764 - 01:33:56.218, Speaker H: Yeah, I agree 100%. And we're seeing that on our discord as well. And people are taking charge. We have a community there called DNA because we're genetic genome pets. So our vip community is called DNA in there. And everybody in there actually act like they own the game, which they do. Our game will eventually be owned by the community and they're making suggestions, making rules and moderating the whole discord channel for us.
01:33:56.266 - 01:34:25.682, Speaker B: Actually, I'm going to move slightly. A couple years in the future maybe. I think that's being the openness of blockchain. You can see who participated in previous drops. So people are. Next games are going to be doing drops on your people who have bought into your drops. Have you thought about that at all? Is that good? What part of that are positive and negative? Is it building the ecosystem? How do I do that appropriately? If I'm a game that's just trying to enhance the ecosystem, how do I do that gracefully?
01:34:25.858 - 01:34:32.322, Speaker H: So do you mean the open blockchain being the same game doing drops over and over again?
01:34:32.378 - 01:34:54.246, Speaker B: Or more like everybody who pays the static amount for monkey ball, I'm producing another game. I think there's a lot of overlap in our player bases. I kind of want to market my stuff and I can drop to the same players that have dropped on monkey ball. Maybe I'm making a, I don't know, volleyball game or something? Yeah. Can we think about how that can be done?
01:34:54.310 - 01:34:58.910, Speaker A: You mean the sort of sushi attacks uniswap?
01:34:58.982 - 01:34:59.806, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:34:59.990 - 01:35:30.444, Speaker A: Sort of, yes. To be honest, I am weary of that. But if it happens means we're doing well, right? I mean, I don't see people dropping on small games. That doesn't make sense. So kind of be happy and flattered if that happens to us. It does not mean that I love it, but we'll see. And if it can make sense somehow, I mean, if we're not eroding value from our community, then by all means, yeah.
01:35:30.444 - 01:35:50.384, Speaker A: And, you know, people. And that's the whole idea. If you created this economy and I'm disincentivized to leave the game and go to another game that just dropped me something, I'm disincentivized to do that because I'm happy with this community. Great. It's kind of like immigration, right? If I'm happy where I am, I'm not moving.
01:35:50.964 - 01:36:07.132, Speaker H: Yeah. I think these vampire attacks are a little more difficult in gaming than it is in defi, just simply because you can't fork the code and fork everything and just, you know, and then airdrop. But I mean, the danger does exist, but I feel like that's what makes it exciting and challenging.
01:36:07.228 - 01:36:13.092, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's nothing, I mean, going back to the community. I mean, you can't fork the community and everything that goes along with that and.
01:36:13.108 - 01:36:16.468, Speaker H: Yeah, and Uniswap still exists. Fine. With sushiswap. So.
01:36:16.556 - 01:36:17.292, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:36:17.308 - 01:36:46.808, Speaker B: Another thing I was thinking about that was if you use some of monkey balls or geno pets in the next game, you use some of your open standards or whatever is kind of created on top of that, that just has more use cases for your content and that can only increase the ecosystem and the robustness of the ecosystem. So I view that as a positive thing for the community, the ecosystem around gaming.
01:36:46.896 - 01:37:00.592, Speaker H: Yeah. And I feel like it's too early in this process to think of things as a zero sum game. I think any traction we can build together, and the pie is still very small and it could grow super big from here. So I'm not too worried about that.
01:37:00.728 - 01:37:03.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not too worried about that. Yeah.
01:37:03.040 - 01:37:16.976, Speaker B: So we're kind of getting close to the end of time, I guess, when I would leave with like, what are you most excited about? Like, you've done some drops, you've kind of like seeing how this is going. What are you looking for? Like, what is kind of like the utopia as you. As you.
01:37:17.160 - 01:37:24.404, Speaker H: So our thesis is that we can build a game alongside our community. I'm excited to see how that works out.
01:37:26.104 - 01:38:01.536, Speaker A: I'm actually super excited about, you know, the upcoming milestones, like our ideo, our NFT drop. And then we're super excited about the sort of content that we created because I've just seen the NFTs yesterday and they are beautiful. They are beautiful, but they're not just beautiful with a collectible value. They are game players. You know, they have stats and some are rare and are super fast. And I'm thinking about creating content, you know, with actual teams and like, it's endless opportunities and players can be super portable and just enjoy this. And as I said, we're playing the government in some aspects.
01:38:01.536 - 01:38:07.844, Speaker A: We're playing God because we're interfering with genome, right. And creating these sort of things. It's magnificent.
01:38:08.224 - 01:38:09.552, Speaker H: I'm excited for monkey ball.
01:38:09.648 - 01:38:43.188, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm excited for what we are not even thinking at this moment. Meaning as a gamer, as a community member, I mean, having genopets and monkey balls, all as part of our partners at Metaflex Studios, why not some kind of collaboration where as a gamer I could hop into both metaverses, possibly both, and even our other vip partners like Neon Heroes Ambiance Studios would love to see just a lot of fun collaborations to come. And of course, once a big gaming series come in, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, I think it's going to open up a lot more creativity.
01:38:43.236 - 01:38:46.952, Speaker B: You could have an egg as a soccer ball. Sorry, an egg as a soccer ball.
01:38:47.008 - 01:38:54.120, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's talk all the weird ideas.
01:38:54.232 - 01:38:58.152, Speaker B: Good, good thought to end on. Thank you so much for your time.
01:38:58.248 - 01:39:05.044, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, thanks. That's great.
01:39:06.584 - 01:39:08.044, Speaker H: I learned a lot from you.
01:39:14.564 - 01:39:15.412, Speaker D: Good afternoon.
01:39:15.468 - 01:39:16.740, Speaker A: We're back.
01:39:16.892 - 01:39:30.940, Speaker D: We are here for what is going to be the last panel from the growth stage. And I think actually from breakpoint, asude's wrapping up as well. So with this, we are going to be talking about oracles.
01:39:31.012 - 01:39:31.316, Speaker A: Right?
01:39:31.380 - 01:39:57.186, Speaker D: So this is kind of a fun topic. I'm passionate about them. I'm actually moderating this session. So you're going to see a great stage transition in a second. But the thing about Oracles is you can't trust them and you have to trust them. And that's like, it's this beautiful paradox that you exist in and they play an incredibly important role in the entire ecosystem and they've made a ton of stuff possible. There's a whole bunch more to come.
01:39:57.186 - 01:39:59.894, Speaker D: So let's bring everyone up on stage and talk about oracles.
01:40:09.414 - 01:40:10.190, Speaker A: Alrighty.
01:40:10.302 - 01:40:12.294, Speaker D: All right. How you guys feeling?
01:40:12.334 - 01:40:13.022, Speaker I: How you doing?
01:40:13.158 - 01:40:31.810, Speaker D: Doing great. So just to get right into it, oracles are not new. They've been around as a concept for a while. They suffered massive manipulations and attacks in some of the early days. Right. We're talking about like pre on chain even. Right.
01:40:31.810 - 01:40:50.654, Speaker D: The first applications that we're trying to bring data in from the real world onto something that's a trusted environment, from a trustless environment. So we'd love to just sort of start out with quick little intros from you guys about yourselves. The projects you're contributing to, and then we'll get into some of the real questions we're here for.
01:40:51.074 - 01:41:18.934, Speaker I: Cool. So, hi, I am Mitch. I left my job at Google last year to start switchboard, which we are calling a community curated oracle, where we allow people to generate their own data feeds, choose their own sources, and let people bring the long tail of data on chain. And we want to build a massive store of information. We want to let people connect a generic data bridge from the Internet to the blockchain.
01:41:19.094 - 01:41:40.944, Speaker A: Great. Cool. I'm Hendrik. I work at jump trading, or jump crypto, and we're co contributor to PIF network, Piff Network's price Oracle built in Solana blockchain, which aims to bring first party data right from the source. So where the prices get created, meaning the exchanges, the traders on chain as fast as possible in the highest fidelity as possible.
01:41:41.844 - 01:41:51.934, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm Chris Romita. I'm one of the co founders of Switchboard, along with Mitch over here. And we're doing our best to build the long tail data on Solana and make that accessible for developers.
01:41:52.834 - 01:42:02.250, Speaker I: Awesome. Hey, guys, I'm Kanav. I'm the president of Jump Crypto. I've totally lost my voice, and I work with Hendrik on all the stuff that he talked about.
01:42:02.442 - 01:42:36.402, Speaker D: Excellent. So let's get right into it. There's many ways to get data on chain. There's many ways to orchestrate that coordination, to make sure that the thing that's actually representing something on chain reflects the off chain reality. Both of the projects you contribute to are taking very different approaches to getting that data on chain. The nature of who can provide it and then what, actually, those mechanics of how it's either verified or distributed on chain. Hendrik, do you want to start and give us kind of a quick overview of how pith works and those decisions in architecture?
01:42:36.578 - 01:43:22.094, Speaker A: Absolutely. So pith essentially consists of one major group of participants, which is right now price providers. And these are essentially the most important players that essentially create the price. So price components come from exchanges, from traders that report their trades, and they push the real time data right into Solana at the highest frequency as possible, which is Solana slot time, which varies between 405 hundred milliseconds. So essentially, there's price feeds on chain that reflect, for example, BTC USD. And these component providers will stream their view of the world, essentially right onto chain. Where is it then aggregated into a price.
01:43:22.094 - 01:43:43.514, Speaker A: And I think what's quite special about PIF, also into a confidence interval, everyone also reports confidence because what is a price? A price can vary a lot. Like markets can be super wide, there can be a huge spread, there might be a mid price, but actually you can't really trade at this price. And we're trying to reflect this view of the whole world as well in the project.
01:43:43.594 - 01:43:50.330, Speaker D: So when you say you're talking about price feeds, what kinds of price feeds are actually, is pith contributing onto chain?
01:43:50.442 - 01:44:02.002, Speaker A: Yeah, currently it's price feeds on equities and on crypto. Yep. So essentially mostly USD pairs and crypto pairs being bridge on chain.
01:44:02.138 - 01:44:04.744, Speaker D: So Mitch, tell us a little bit of switchboard and its decisions.
01:44:04.864 - 01:44:05.192, Speaker C: Right.
01:44:05.248 - 01:44:38.252, Speaker I: So switchboard takes an approach where we just want to let anyone plug in a public API from the Internet and take a quantitative piece of data from the Internet, be able to transform it however they want, and bring that on chain. We are not specific towards price, and we don't have the proprietary sources like pith does. So we might be a little bit behind because we are using public sources like you can go into binance.com API and get a source from them. We also allow you to get websocket information as well so you can be a little bit faster with that whole operation. And then. Yeah, that means.
01:44:38.308 - 01:44:47.104, Speaker D: Yep, totally, of course. So when we're looking at something like that, do you consider yourself an oracle, a data feed? Do you see a difference between those two terms?
01:44:47.524 - 01:44:59.792, Speaker I: So when we are creating an oracle, I imagine that as a bridge to any off chain data, and we are just trying to make it generic for any piece of off chain data. So I see those as synonymous personally.
01:44:59.928 - 01:45:00.384, Speaker A: Got it?
01:45:00.424 - 01:45:26.070, Speaker I: Yeah. And when we actually have this, we have, you know, a set of oracles that will report the same value. We have. Each oracle take the median from multiple sources that are mapped to a single data point, which we call a data feed. And then after all, the oracles decide what the truth is, and our current setup is the median, we take the median of oracles results as well. So you would need to corrupt 51% of the, of the sources or 51% of the oracles to edit the result.
01:45:26.182 - 01:45:26.590, Speaker A: Got it.
01:45:26.622 - 01:45:52.438, Speaker D: So sticking with switchboard for a second, when you're talking about bringing data on chain, what is that sort of, is there a verification process for that? Like if I'm providing a feed for an arbitrary set of data and someone's providing a feed for what is ostensibly that same arbitrary set of data, does the developer pick one of those to go to? Does the system automatically create some sort of. This one's right, this one's not right.
01:45:52.486 - 01:46:30.068, Speaker I: So in our v two model, we are actually letting data consumers publish their own data feeds and they can actually choose each individual source they trust in their data feed. And with that we are letting people actually choose the incentive model on how much oracles need to stake, how much they're rewarded and how they are slashed. Since we think that it's unpredictable for an oracle provider to actually know the downstream use case and the person actually consuming the data should choose the slashing mechanisms that the oracles will have repercussions to make sure their incentives are aligned with the maximum incentives of your application.
01:46:30.236 - 01:46:52.624, Speaker D: So Hendrik, you guys chose a bit of a different model, right? That coalescing of multiple data coming from multiple providers into one data point that is done on chain, that's done in a system where the user is not picking, oh, I want the data from this provider, but they're getting one. Like tell us a little bit why that decision was made and sort of your thoughts on that architecture and approach.
01:46:52.784 - 01:47:38.546, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think the thought behind this model was primarily on preventing staleness and getting the most transparent and up to date prices possible. So if you look at, let's say, third party price sources, let's look at Google Finance for example, there's some price moving happening, there's delay in price feeds. Public APIs are limited, but at the same time there's also the point of, and that maybe is coming from jumps roots in traditional finance of licensing the data, like fetching arbitrary APIs. You don't know how the price is composed, but obviously it's also the property of whoever is providing this API. And pushing this on chain might come with certain legal implications. So with PIV, the core is to get the data from the source and have the source provide the data itself.
01:47:38.546 - 01:48:08.888, Speaker A: And that means the source is taking that right from the exchange. No, let's say magic math or inertia being put into the price. It's the straight price from the market, including confidence. So you prevent, let's say intransparency. Just on a panel yesterday, we were talking about bridges and trust. And with each party you introduce in between, it's more layers of obfuscation of what's moving, what additional methods been applied to the price versus the actual source. And the source can be a lot like the source is where you can actually trade it.
01:48:08.888 - 01:48:59.902, Speaker A: In the end, the price is an indication of what you can buy and what you can sell or the product of price and confidence. So in a lot of cases this might also be on chain data actually so, for example, the serum market, there might be a coin that is not listed on centralized exchanges, but is traded actively on serum and maybe by a couple parties, OTC. So the OTC traders would report their prices straight into the feed. And the on chain contract, actually, like serum, would also report its price into PIF, where it is aggregated. So you always have first party data and you know exactly where it's coming from and you know it's straight from the source. No, like layers of obfuscation or parties in between that are, let's say, not aligned or involved. Like often with oracles, you have people fetching APIs with a price source that makes up the price, someone fetching the price and then the chain, we take out the middle piece essentially.
01:49:00.038 - 01:49:39.294, Speaker D: So in looking at like, this is kind of another component, component of architecture design. Somewhere in PIF, the project is choosing what kinds of data feeds you're adding and what kinds you're not, whereas with switchboard you are letting the user put anything in. Tell us a little bit about that decision process there. I guess the question I'm trying to get at here is data has to be of a certain quality to be usable and you've removed any sort of gatekeeping function from that. What do you see as the advantages of a model like that, or not the advantages necessarily, but the different use cases that'll come from that kind of data feed.
01:49:40.434 - 01:50:33.240, Speaker I: The main difficulty with not making a generic is that it really limits who can be an oracle. Because then if you actually want to get these really custom pieces of data, you have to build your own adapters, or at least the classical sense of oracles. In this model we can. Even if you are hosting your own data, you can host your own API and just plug that in with the ubiquitous type of language that we've built. So we have a whole system, instead of actually having external adapters where an oracle provider needs to make a really niche set of what they're configured to actually feed, they can just have a set of API keys and the code will be static. So it makes it really, really simple to pick up new Oracle providers if you make this language as static as possible. So it's really a way to just lower the barrier for getting people to run an oracle.
01:50:33.352 - 01:50:33.808, Speaker A: Got it.
01:50:33.856 - 01:50:52.364, Speaker D: So, Kanav, you have in your role as president of Jump Crypto, there are a huge number of very powerful known and unknown firms that are contributing data to pip. Talk a little bit about how like that was able to be achieved. These are companies you normally don't see collaborating on anything.
01:50:52.984 - 01:51:44.854, Speaker I: Yeah, it all comes down to establishing trust between mutually distrusting participants. And that's the magic that blockchain has given us as a new means of resource coordination, as participants in the system are able to engage with the contracts according to the rules specified, regardless of who's deploying the contract right in the code. And that ability to export trust to a chain like Solana has unlocked, you know, positive sum games where only zero sum games existed before. And so, you know, a lot of our competitors in the traditional space, you know, whom we don't always have the warmest feelings towards, you know, have now come into the fold and, you know, are helping us build, you know, what we think can be a really critical piece of tooling and infrastructure infrastructure for crypto. Additionally, I'll say in our conversations.
01:51:46.834 - 01:51:47.194, Speaker A: Trying.
01:51:47.234 - 01:52:23.818, Speaker I: To walk a lot of these major institutions through the mental models and through the necessarily technical requirements to pull something like this off, it's really just very exciting to see really smart engineers and engineering organizations have their first interactions with private keys, with sending transactions to a peer to peer network. And that unlocks entirely new mental models for a whole new suite of engineers that weren't in the space before. So that's been one of the quite exciting outcomes from our perspective there.
01:52:23.866 - 01:52:24.194, Speaker A: Nice.
01:52:24.274 - 01:53:09.078, Speaker D: So I, in my own personal experience, have been using an unnamed fintech app, and I've seen the price of something that I've been tracking go up 10,000%, and I've hit sell. And of course, the transaction gets reversed by the clearinghouse in a few days, and you're just where you were before. That's a very centralized approach, because these things are running through clearinghouses that are run by companies that have delays, that actually have the ability to go back in time and change an order. Even if the app told me that I was able to sell something for an astronomically inflated price, they'll reverse that in the future. So you can't do this in blockchain, right? This isn't the way things are built. This isn't the web3 ecosystem as it is now. It's possible that someone could build some sort of system like that in the future.
01:53:09.078 - 01:53:35.534, Speaker D: But talk about how people who are actually building with these, whether it's a fintech app, whether it's anyone that has to deal with data that is inherently coming from a source, that even if you are dealing with a 51% situation, even if you're dealing with institutional grade data providers, there is the potential for something to not be reflected because it's inherently coming from off chain. What should developers be thinking about when they're using any sort of oracle data?
01:53:36.394 - 01:54:40.094, Speaker I: Yeah, I can go. So that exact problem is one of the big motivations behind confidence intervals. In pit, you'll often see very sophisticated data sources print the 10,000% inflated prices due to technological bugs. No engineering organization is prone to failure. And the strong benefit of having independent pricing from dozens of major institutions is that you're able to get a sense of the dispersion of pricing and make decisions based off of that. And so if you see a flash crash on finance or Coinbase goes down for a couple hours because of exchange overload, or retail broker x prints a price at 10,000% above market price, you're able to see a confidence interval widening out, and you're able to either alter and pause settlements, you're able to widen the price at which you're offering liquidity on your protocol. Particularly important for guys that are offering, you know, things related to options or automatic pricing amms.
01:54:40.094 - 01:54:45.072, Speaker I: And that then becomes a pretty core component of how you use this data.
01:54:45.072 - 01:54:45.504, Speaker A: Good.
01:54:45.504 - 01:55:09.744, Speaker I: There is no reversibility. You can have reversibility. In fact, I think synthetix in its current implementation has a six second clawback, where, you know, the price kind of rewards if the trade goes against you, and that's to counteract the staleness of the feed. And so systems like that can be engineered. But I think paying attention to the dispersion and the quality of the data. Data is critical.
01:55:10.204 - 01:55:10.984, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:55:12.684 - 01:55:13.020, Speaker I: Yeah.
01:55:13.052 - 01:55:14.460, Speaker D: For me, either of you.
01:55:14.532 - 01:56:02.076, Speaker I: Great, I'd love to. I think this actually comes down to reputation of sources that you use, at least for switch forward, where people are actually the ones choosing this. We are building a curation pipeline where people are actually incentivized to get highly reputative sources in this switchboard catalog for people to use in their data feed. And if their sources are actually reputative, then they get better rewards because more people will be publishing them in their data feeds. So we have a model where people who actually catalog and categorize the web get positive kickbacks the more they're used and trusted by the community. So that is a mechanism. We're trying to remove these distrustful sources from being propagated in people's data feeds.
01:56:02.076 - 01:56:17.544, Speaker I: But yes, if it's already being used in somebody's data feed and it's already being published on chain, it does add some risk that they could tamper with the price. But we also have a min and max reported value from all of the sources and all of the oracles. So you can get some idea of confidence as well.
01:56:18.404 - 01:56:19.664, Speaker D: Are you worried?
01:56:20.244 - 01:56:20.836, Speaker A: Oh, no.
01:56:20.900 - 01:56:45.434, Speaker D: The other thing I was going to add is just leaving it up to developers to make the model fit within their security thresholds and with their specific applications. You know, our prices and sort of the default indexes may be good for some users, but we don't think it's going to be good for every developer. And with switchboard v two, we leave it up to the developers themselves to publish the feed or publish the index, or publish whatever they need on chain that fits the specific needs of their application.
01:56:45.734 - 01:57:18.206, Speaker A: Yeah. And I also think just really projects making use of, like price data is not just a single dimension. Price data is multi dimensional. We've brought up confidence, we've brought up the price component itself, but there's way more to it. Like in the traditional equities world, we have corporate actions where there might be a stock split, and generally in crypto we have the notion of supply. Let's imagine a coin sees the success of all the dotcoins going on right now and decide to do a coin split on some protocols. That's not possible, but I certainly think something like this might happen.
01:57:18.206 - 01:57:46.770, Speaker A: And this is something that, for example, if you're running a futures exchange like derivatives exchange, you want to definitely take care of because otherwise the price goes down by ten x and you will not do what to do with it. So really looking at the multidimensionality of data, and I think that's also why we're approaching this in a very purpose specific point. A price feed for equities prices might look different than a weather feed on chain or a sports match outcome feed would look like in the future.
01:57:46.882 - 01:58:19.846, Speaker D: Yeah, I also love that because we are seeing real world versions of this. Keep a nucypher when you're seeing combinations and for lack of a better terms, mergers going on in the space, there's only a time before that becomes more and more common. So you mentioned a model where people are rewarded for providing high quality data. Are you concerned about the first mover advantage? Are you concerned that the people who are first to publish to the network, and you see this in any sort of ecosystem, the people who are first there, there's a set of architects arbitrary advantages that come with it.
01:58:19.870 - 01:58:20.054, Speaker A: Right.
01:58:20.094 - 01:58:41.214, Speaker D: The first oracle that publishes on chain is the most used oracle. And the switching costs are sometimes hard. If you're doing a system where you're asking people, oh, what data would you like to use? Who's the most trusted? Are you concerned about them always picking the same one? Is that desirable? Does that increase trust? Does it decrease trust?
01:58:41.374 - 01:59:28.144, Speaker I: So I want to clarify the difference between people curating the Internet for job sources and actually people publishing data feeds that are being supported live on chain. When we're talking about people categorizing the Internet, we just are rewarding people for bringing these certain jobs, what we call jobs on chain, into a data feed that people can use. And if they're the first mover, that's actually beneficial. They are populating this catalog that anyone can use. So it's not that someone's publishing a specific data feed that's going to be publishing a certain set of sources that other people are just going to use and trust. It's about building that categorization and catalog that anyone can use. And if someone's the first mover to categorize binance and FTX in a really well formatted way that people can use, I think more power to them.
01:59:29.284 - 01:59:36.340, Speaker D: All right, how many oracles do we need? I joke, but it's a real question.
01:59:36.532 - 01:59:37.292, Speaker I: Unbounded.
01:59:37.388 - 01:59:38.704, Speaker D: Yeah, unbounded.
01:59:39.004 - 02:00:07.664, Speaker I: We want to make a bridge to the Internet. That's the goal of oracles. It should be per usage for prediction markets. Talk about a single season, you know, you might need over 200 feeds for every game. You know, it's unbounded and it's infinite. It's going to keep growing. Yeah, I think there's definitely a market for purpose specific oracles, and I think the special tool, rather than the swiss army knife is probably the right choice for extremely high value transactions.
02:00:07.664 - 02:00:41.724, Speaker I: So you've kind of seen this approach for financial data, for web data, running wasm with some zero knowledge proofs inside a browser probably ends up being the best approach. If you're looking at, I don't know, sports betting outcomes and other data sets, that's probably a better tool that's better specified to bring that in. If you're looking at the job style stuff, that talking about something like switchboard makes all the sense in the world. And so there's room for a lot of different architectures, and you kind of got to pick the right tool for the tasks that you're trying to get at.
02:00:43.104 - 02:01:26.704, Speaker D: Where do you see this space evolving? Give us, I mean, no one can say anything intelligent about probably more than three years in the future, but what's that stuff you're just starting to look at now and see, oh, this is the place oracles are going. Arbitrary data coming on was not something most people were talking about. A few years ago. Confidence intervals is not something people were talking about a few years ago. These are new tools that most developers haven't even started using and integrating into their dapps. What are you looking at now for the future of this stuff? I think a big thing is just what's going to happen with the future on chain activity versus off chain activity. This is just pure speculation, but my bias is I think you're going to see a lot more activity happen on chain in three years than you see today.
02:01:26.704 - 02:02:05.284, Speaker D: And because of that, the nature of oracles are going to change. You're going to be referencing a lot more, integrating a lot more on chain data, for example, and maybe mixing that with the off chain sources as part of that. So an example would be if you're building a pricing index in the future, I think a lot more pricing indexes will rely on both dexs as well as centralized exchanges to create that composite index versus solely one or the other. And I think any oracle, at least certainly one, as generalized as switchboard, we're looking at not just off chain data, but also ways to integrate on chain data as well and leave it up to the developers themselves to have this easy to use solution to fit their data needs for their application.
02:02:07.064 - 02:02:49.950, Speaker I: Yeah, yeah. So I got a little more to it. You want to go? Thank you. So I actually very much agree with Chris, and in that sense, where I see more traders actually moving on chain, I think a focus in the future is going to be real world activity, like weather data being a very important source that we're still always going to need in Oracle four, and especially with nfts, especially for event based ticketing, I think that we're going to see a lot of oracles around more ephemeral events. So sports, data, concerts, events like this. I think we could have oracles surrounding when things start, when things end. What was the attendance of this event? You know, things like that.
02:02:49.950 - 02:02:58.954, Speaker I: I think ephemeral based events and anything attached to nfts will always need some sort of oracle backing them.
02:02:59.574 - 02:03:36.298, Speaker A: I also agree on the point of on chain data, and I think just looking at how things are going, we were talking about bridges yesterday. We're entering a multi chain world where this information is, is not just present on one chain, but multiple components to price, multiple components to the outcome of certain events is distributed across multiple chains. So I see bridges playing a large role in the oracle world, not just in bringing information from the oracles to other chains to be consumed, but also bringing information in to be then combined into new prices I was going to.
02:03:36.306 - 02:03:37.334, Speaker I: Say what Hendrik said.
02:03:37.994 - 02:04:18.934, Speaker D: Excellent. So we're looking at price data. We're looking at arbitrary data. What's missing here, I don't mean arbitrary data can encompass a lot of things, but what are the kinds of data that either something can be derived from price, from a confidence? I guess what I'm thinking about is a social sentiment is in some ways a price feed, and you can have a confidence interval in something like that. The polling dials that are done for, for politicians speeches, where they're dialing all that information in, are there ways you can bring that sort of high fidelity information on chain for things besides pricing or just data points? More soft data, subjective analysis?
02:04:19.014 - 02:04:53.682, Speaker I: Right, right. This was actually something that we've been discussing before. Let's say that you want to have a work of art or like a book on chain. You know, you want to ensure that integrity of that is always maintained. It's a little hard to have oracles come to agreement on something that's not quantitative. So there are mathematical operations you can do, like Lichtenstein distances on different byte strings, and just choose the result of a set of oracles that has the lowest Lichtensteen's distance to everything else. And that's something we've been exploring, but it's a little hard to implement because those types of data can be dynamically sized.
02:04:53.682 - 02:05:04.090, Speaker I: And with Solana, you have to actually take account size into consideration. But there is a possibility, and if we have a set allocation and bound, that's something you could do.
02:05:04.162 - 02:05:04.634, Speaker A: Great.
02:05:04.754 - 02:05:08.570, Speaker D: Well, I think we're out of time here today, but thank you all so much for joining us.
02:05:08.642 - 02:05:10.334, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having us.
02:05:19.114 - 02:05:49.252, Speaker D: So, thank you all for joining us here today. I think it's fitting that for this session, we're wrapping up in a beautiful greenhouse on the growth stage, talking about what's coming next, what's the future. You know, there's no roadmap presented here. As we were saying at the opening, this is all about what the community is building across the board. So I think, first off, just thank you all for coming. It's been lovely to see this place evolve and build over time. So, you know, that's.
02:05:49.252 - 02:05:55.244, Speaker D: We're at the end today, so it's time to bring up Rajnanitoli to say a few words before we send you all home.
02:06:13.024 - 02:06:38.908, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Did you have a good time? Nice. Awesome. This has been so beautiful. It's been such an amazing set of events. And all the builders that came on stage across all the three venues and showed what they're working on and had so much passion for what they're doing. It's just, like, truly inspiring.
02:06:38.908 - 02:07:05.294, Speaker A: And it really. I can feel the energy here. I think everybody's been talking about the energy across the whole set of events as the beginning of something really special. So I'm super happy about that. Yeah. This has been just kind of blown my mind, honestly. Really didn't expect this many people to show up when everything sold out in, like, two weeks.
02:07:05.294 - 02:07:39.526, Speaker A: I was blown away, but still didn't really belong. Believe that that was really happening. And of all the folks that I met, you know, I shook, like, a million hands, so hope nobody got sick from me. But it was just awesome to feel the energy of the people working and building in the ecosystem and just feel their vibes and ideas flowing out of them. Of all the things we can build in the future. Yeah. And also, of course, thank you so much, all of you, for coming to Lisbon.
02:07:39.526 - 02:08:31.966, Speaker A: If you're not from here already, give yourself a round of applause. It's like. It definitely like nothing happens without all of you and everyone that's watching, you know, these videos, all these talks are going to be online. And I really, you know, I really think everyone should go and watch, you know, look through the list. The team that put on this event had such incredible programming. The people that came and showed what they're working on and what their ideas are and how they're approaching the space, they had really transformative and impactful things to say. And I think everyone was so busy just meeting each other and celebrating and enjoying this time that a lot of those talks didn't get seen by everyone.
02:08:31.966 - 02:09:06.866, Speaker A: But actually, can we get the slides up? We have some recaps. There you go. So, yeah, a few highlights. The events were awesome. Did you guys like Lisbon? You like this? Yeah. Do it again here next year, you think? Yeah, we'll see. We'll vote on it, I think.
02:09:06.866 - 02:09:24.322, Speaker A: Yeah. I had people tell me we should do it every quarter. I think I have an idea of what next year looks like. And it's not just going to be nothing. And then next year, so there will be stuff. It'll be good, but, yeah. No.
02:09:24.322 - 02:10:28.916, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the team and the event organizers, amplified, helped put this event on and they just did a knockout job. So I mentioned some of these incredible builders. I really think everyone should go watch Jules's speech. Jules from render is going to change the world. If you didn't see what he's working on and what he's built and what he's using Solana for it is photo realistic real time rendering of any 3d model using a distributed set of GPU's all over the world with a token to access it. It's basically like, what is the cost of a virtual photon and ray tracing? And it's going to be, I think, the basis for a metaverse that is so much more real than any of us has been talking about or expecting. And I think it's going to happen way faster than any of us is expecting.
02:10:28.916 - 02:11:12.454, Speaker A: So definitely check that one out. Jules announced that he's doing it all on Solana. There's going to be a render token, and he's got this incredible vision and I can't wait to see it come true. Do you want to talk about Brendan? Brendan, one of my heroes in software and founder of JavaScript. He was basically there when Mozilla developed the rust language. And it's amazing. It's amazing for him to commit brave to such a deep integration with Solana and really try to take a swing on an idea of a web that is built from the ground up to be non parasitical, the web two that we have today.
02:11:12.454 - 02:11:43.722, Speaker A: I'm just really excited for him to be involved. It's just awesome. It's incredible. Brendan, yeah, he made JavaScript, he's the guy who created JavaScript, and he's 44 million users. They're going to have a Dex aggregator with an in browser wallet. All Solana native, actually. So after the neon talk, Astani from Aave announced.
02:11:43.722 - 02:12:05.658, Speaker A: Aave is going to be on Solana curve is going to be on Solana through neon. Sushi will be on Solana through neon. And brave. All those 44 million users will default to the Solana instance of all of these applications, these deFi blue chips that really pioneered the space. It's incredible. That's not even the whole thing. You have to watch the whole talk.
02:12:05.658 - 02:12:22.634, Speaker A: It's incredible. He's going to build a decentralized ad network that will challenge Google the way that all of our web properties work today. So it's just incredible. And it's not vaporware. These people are really building this stuff. It's not like 2017. So I just can't wait.
02:12:22.634 - 02:13:22.574, Speaker A: I mean, it's going to be so transformative. Alexis Ohanian, so similar, like an amazing experience to be able to sit on stage with a hero of mine who built, I think, one of the most positive communities in social that's organized around interests and topics. And that, I think was probably one of the first real big Web three properties that also embraced pseudonymity and allowed people to have an identity that they want on the Internet. And Reddit's gigantic. But Alexis has this vision for how social can play out on Web three that I think is going to be as transformative, ten times as transformative as what Reddit and Twitter and Facebook have been able to achieve. And it's a distributed one. It's where everyone is building it together with different clients, different protocols that are all interacting with one another.
02:13:22.574 - 02:13:47.954, Speaker A: And Alexis announced $100 million fund to support that. And he's very serious about mentoring and supporting, supporting this next wave of entrepreneurs to build that future. So it's like a dream. It's crazy. Yeah, please watch that one. I mean, there's all of the talks and especially technical ones for the engineers as well. Really awesome stuff.
02:13:47.954 - 02:14:28.374, Speaker A: Bartosz. Give Bartosz a round of applause. I don't even know how to describe Bartosz. Yeah. If you're an engineer and you got a chance to hang out with Bartosz, with Jordan, with the neodym folks, like everyone building in the community, the feedback that I got, I didn't get a chance to sit and really code with you guys. And I'm jealous of that, that it was awesome. You could actually, like, feel the energy of people as they were typing the keys.
02:14:28.374 - 02:14:44.010, Speaker A: We're gonna get you back to coding. Yeah, he's gonna code again. Also, Bartosz has, like, really built this wonderful. I mean, he built the hacker house here that, you know, that was. Anybody at the hacker house? Yeah. Cool. A lot of you.
02:14:44.010 - 02:14:57.868, Speaker A: I mean, it sounded awesome. I never, I didn't get to go there. And he has the same thing in Chicago. I think we're gonna build these all over the world. World. And every one of these conferences, I think, will have these hacker houses. Like, if you want to just go build, just go build.
02:14:57.868 - 02:15:18.154, Speaker A: We can talk over here. So. Yeah, no, awesome, awesome job, Bartosz. And, oh, just more people. Sam. Sam Bateman Fried. You know what? A dynamic person, really instrumental in the early days of, of the network meltem.
02:15:18.154 - 02:16:08.542, Speaker A: Kyle Georgios from paradigm, Tegan from edge and node. Just incredible people that are all leaders in this network. Right? It's, what is it like? Decentralization is an abundance of leaders, not zero leaders, right? These are all the leaders emerging. And you can be that, too. Right? And what's cool is that there's so much overlap with the Solana community and the Ethereum one, but it's definitely distinct. And a lot of these folks are in both. And that's totally fine because the vision is one of where we enable decentralization and the idea of cryptographic self custody and ownership through that for the entire world together.
02:16:08.542 - 02:16:37.814, Speaker A: That, to me, has always been part of this. Yeah. Like, Solana is just an extension of the movement that has existed and continues to exist and grow. Like, we're just trying to grow the movement of everyone having key pairs and self custody and transacting and interacting and messaging peer to peer in a global state machine. And it's. I think this conference has really made it clear that that's going to happen. I think it's going to happen very quickly.
02:16:37.814 - 02:17:07.528, Speaker A: Investors, it's like, kind of, you know, there's a little bit of stigma around investors. Right. Like, coming to a conference and wanting to invest in everything and take everyone's time. Right. But, like, it doesn't happen without them either. Right. Everyone has to be, you know, contributing and investors, you know, convince the world that it makes sense to take their hard earned money and value and put it into these crazy early speculative things.
02:17:07.528 - 02:17:44.296, Speaker A: Like, nobody knows that these things are going to work, but investors tell that story and they make it happen. Like, we have to appreciate them, I think so investors were on stage and shared their vision and shared their work, and I think that's really important, too. Are we all going to make it? We're all going to make it. We're all going to make it. This venue is really cool. Yeah, this is a really awesome venue. I was just walking through the forest with Nigel Eccles.
02:17:44.296 - 02:18:23.644, Speaker A: He started fanduel and grew that into a giant sports betting business. He's starting Bet Dex, which is a sports betting protocol on Solana and vaults, which is NFTs as passes to all kinds of creator content. And, I mean, it's just switching between that inspiring, just vibing and sharing a vision and then coming into your closed space and building. I think that kind of rhymes with COVID too. Just COVID. Everyone was inside building, building. And I think breakpoint was kind of like going outside and reflecting together and sharing dreams.
02:18:23.644 - 02:18:52.306, Speaker A: My one hope is that over the next year, we just don't spend all of our time at conferences. Like, just come to ours and let the rest. They're cool, too. Anything to add? No. Cool. This was cool. Did you all see this? The visualization, live visualization of network transactions and activity.
02:18:52.306 - 02:19:29.709, Speaker A: We're going to need a bigger block space. So, I mean, Jules should render this with much higher resolution next year. We'll talk to Jules about that. Yeah, but I never imagined scenes like this talking to everyone here is that we're going to need a lot more block space. Yeah, I think that we're going to fill up all this block space and then. Yeah, then you're going to have to just code and handle it all. Awesome.
02:19:29.709 - 02:19:40.714, Speaker A: So that's it. That's all we had prepared. Again, thank you so much. I mean, from the bottom of our hearts for coming and being part of this movement. It's just incredible. Yeah. Thank you all.
