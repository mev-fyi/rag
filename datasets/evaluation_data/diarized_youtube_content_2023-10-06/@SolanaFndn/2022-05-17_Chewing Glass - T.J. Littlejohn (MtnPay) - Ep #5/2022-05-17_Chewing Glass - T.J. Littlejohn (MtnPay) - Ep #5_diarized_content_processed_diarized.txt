00:00:00.520 - 00:00:15.294, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it. Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Most of the time, I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it. That's weird. That glass looks half full to me. Eating glass.
00:00:15.334 - 00:00:16.950, Speaker B: Eating glass is staring into the abyss.
00:00:17.062 - 00:00:21.274, Speaker A: Glass. Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this?
00:00:22.854 - 00:00:25.914, Speaker B: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass.
00:00:26.854 - 00:00:29.314, Speaker A: I'm gonna get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:38.514 - 00:00:55.666, Speaker B: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building in the Solana ecosystem. Today we have with us TJ Littlejohn. He is the founder of Mountain Pay, winner of the most recent Solana hackathon payments track for Riptide. TJ, how's it going, man?
00:00:55.810 - 00:00:59.834, Speaker A: Dude, it's going good. We're stoked. Stoked to be here. Thanks for having me on.
00:00:59.914 - 00:01:31.478, Speaker B: Yeah, man. Like, you and I basically met, I feel like, a few months ago when you were building some stuff for iOS, basically some IDL stuff with anchor, and we were talking about potentially getting you some work going on, and then next thing you know, a couple things happened, and here we are. But before we dive too much into that, let's hear a little introduction. I know a lot of people probably don't know a ton about you. Where'd you start your kind of journey and how did you end up here at building in the Solana ecosystem?
00:01:31.606 - 00:01:42.118, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. For sure. A bridge version. So I'm from Florida originally. Born and raised. Grew up in south Florida, went to school in Tallahassee, Florida state.
00:01:42.118 - 00:02:21.530, Speaker A: Granola originally. I was like a big math guy, always wanted to do pure math, and trying to see how I could make a career out of that. Finance was an option, and so I was exploring that, and someone told me I should learn to code. So I started learning to code from that found hackathons, from that found iOS development. And just like, down the rabbit hole there at a hackathon, I ended up, like, securing an internship at Apple, which turned into a job. And then I spent four years there doing, like, research and development and experience prototyping. And then about a year ago, I decided I was done with that and I wanted to be in, like, startups.
00:02:21.530 - 00:02:35.818, Speaker A: And so I left, joined a startup kind of five months after that, I found Solana through, like, some friends, and I just, like, noticed the point in time we were at, and I was just, like, stoked. And so I quit, and I just immediately started building.
00:02:35.946 - 00:02:44.578, Speaker B: Wow. So you don't have a CS degree. You're kind of self taught programmer and landed an internship at Apple, kind of dealing on the development side of things.
00:02:44.706 - 00:02:46.138, Speaker A: No, I do have a CS degree.
00:02:46.226 - 00:02:46.898, Speaker B: Oh, you do?
00:02:46.986 - 00:02:59.540, Speaker A: So I did both. I did math and Cs. But, like, the Cs portion to me was, like, the less interesting one. Like, I just, like, I loved pure math. I thought it was so cool. Like, cs was more of, like, the necessity one. And then I thought it was cool when I.
00:02:59.540 - 00:03:13.468, Speaker A: When I started doing it, and then. But I learned. I think I learned a lot more through, like, just like, my. Like, the apps I built outside of class. So, like, partially self taught, you know? Cause that was the more. That was the more important part. But my education was super important, too.
00:03:13.556 - 00:03:20.616, Speaker B: You have a CS degree. You ended up interning for Apple. You did that for. For how long was it again?
00:03:20.720 - 00:03:21.792, Speaker A: It was four years.
00:03:21.888 - 00:03:25.960, Speaker B: Four years. And you said research. Like, were you actually doing development while you were there?
00:03:26.112 - 00:03:44.584, Speaker A: Yeah, so I did. We did, like, data collection for, like, new products. So, like, think how Face ID was trained on, like, millions of, like, images. We built the software to, like, facilitate those user studies that captured the data to train the models to enable face ID. So, like, we were brought in, like, super early product.
00:03:44.744 - 00:03:55.608, Speaker B: Oh. So, like, I mean, I guess that's kind of a little more interesting. Like, somebody who's into math. Like, you're dealing with lots of kind of data and information opposed to just kind of, like, writing, like, a high level code or something like that.
00:03:55.696 - 00:04:13.408, Speaker A: Not exactly the math. The math thing. It's like, it's like, pure math, right? Like, I don't do with, like, data and numbers and, like, processing. I just think pure math is fucking cool. And, like, when I, like, have, like, an itch about something, I just, like, want to dive and so, like, that was the math thing for me. That was just, like, pure. Like, I love it.
00:04:13.408 - 00:04:41.368, Speaker A: And I think it, like, taught me how to understand stuff, which I think I still like, like, every now and then, like, I'll see I have, like, the power to do that, which is really cool. The thing with Apple was it let me just, like, hack on shit. Like, I had, like, month long projects and, like, software efforts that, like. Cause I get bored really quick. I get bored, which is, like, a blessing and a curse. Historically. Apple just let me work on a project, and then a month later, I was working on something else.
00:04:41.536 - 00:05:14.944, Speaker B: Yeah, we've had some conversations. Like you said, like, you get bored really quick. It kind of comes through a little bit in your personality. You. You get super excited about and kind of bounce around, and, like, that's why, like, your energy is, like, super crazy and, like, incredible. So it's nice to have people so excited about these things. And especially considering the fact of some of the more recent great things that have happened, I kind of want to really start this whole conversation outside of, like, your past on, like, where it all truly, like, truly began, which, from what I understand, was really mountain dial.
00:05:14.944 - 00:05:31.658, Speaker B: That's kind of, like, lit this whole fire off. I don't know if everybody knows about it, and if they do, maybe not. How, like, great of a thing that it turned out to be. Maybe about, like, Barrett and Edgar and what they set up and how it was and then, like, how that whole month went for you, that kind of led to this moment.
00:05:31.786 - 00:06:16.312, Speaker A: So, yeah, now down for people that don't know was a month long hacker house in Salt Lake City, Utah, where people from all over just congregated, and we spent a month working on whatever it is you want to work on in this co working space called the shop. And, like you said, edgar and Barrett, they're actually the ones that got me into Solana. They were the first people to introduce me, and they just threw this hacker house to, like, grow the ecosystem out of, like, the kindness of their own hearts and, like, love for, like, co working and developing and, like, hacking. And so, yeah, a bunch of us came through, and we just, like, we're chilling in Utah. We'd go snowboarding on the weekends. We'd throw parties on, like, Fridays and, like, bring in people from around the city and just, like, strip. Just get after it.
00:06:16.312 - 00:06:34.680, Speaker A: And that was the best part. Like, we'd be working from, like, 10:11 a.m. Was when I would, like, roll in till, like, one, two in the morning most days. And, like, a good crew of people were, like, always, like, they're doing that, too. Maybe if you, like, wanted to go grab dinner, you could. And then people would come back. But, yeah, it was just, like.
00:06:34.680 - 00:06:51.982, Speaker A: It was just, like, a lot of, like, incredibly, like, focused work and, like, a nice, like, little crew is, like, like, formed out of that. And so I've seen a lot of the, like, same mountain down folks at the next, like, hacker houses and stuff, and that's always, like, fun. And. And so, yeah, you just become friends with these people, and, yeah, it seems.
00:06:51.998 - 00:07:09.556, Speaker B: Like there was a lot of building going on. I'm not gonna lie. Like, I saw that notion that Edgar and Barrett or I think it might have been Edgar, correct me if I'm wrong, put together this notion. And I was like, a dev did this just because it was, like, so organized and well put together. And then, like, those guys pretty much, like, put this thing, like, from start to finish, like, got this thing going.
00:07:09.740 - 00:07:26.508, Speaker A: Yeah. There was a lot of people that participate in the setup of it. I know Sam had a big part, Edgar and Barrett had a big part. A lot of those, like, core Salt lake city people were doing this stuff. But, yeah, I mean, they, they just, like, they took out the trash there. It was, like, under the tables the first day, like, taping extension cords. So, like, they.
00:07:26.508 - 00:07:28.300, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, they, they did the stuff.
00:07:28.412 - 00:07:52.214, Speaker B: Yeah, I talked to him in Miami, and he was like, yeah, I have a. I have a room in an office that's filled with about, like, 100 monitors. I can't remember what it is some point, but, like, it looked like there was tons of building going on there. Whenever I see the community, like, they didn't really ask for permission. And, like, a lot of people were saying, why don't you bring a hacker house to our city or this or that? And the reality is, like, you don't need that. Like, you have an idea, you execute. You make it known.
00:07:52.214 - 00:08:13.688, Speaker B: And, like, people are going to come there, and you're probably going to likely get some sponsors to help you, like, put it on, because this is, like, an incubator. And, like, obviously, mountain pay came out of this, which is incredible. Let's. Let's talk a little bit about that. I'm pretty sure maybe I'm wrong. Is that, like, Solana Pay was. Was it announced before you got to mountain Dow, or was it announced, like, why you were there?
00:08:13.816 - 00:08:19.192, Speaker A: It was. It was actually the same day, uh, February 1 is when I rolled through.
00:08:19.288 - 00:08:26.824, Speaker B: I was on a phone call with you, actually, whenever you showed up, you remember that? Like, yeah, we were on, like a. You were like, I just got. I just got to mountain down. Yeah, we, we were.
00:08:26.904 - 00:08:54.432, Speaker A: I probably called you from the airport. Yeah, I've been like, you did probably, like, over committing myself. And I remember we were talking about doing a possible grant or something for that Idl stuff, and I was just trying to not lose that, not doing my end of it. You're like, TJ, if you just write a notion page on your idea, I can do it. I can move it through. And I was like, ah, I don't know, I'm building. And, yeah, so we never got through.
00:08:54.448 - 00:09:04.550, Speaker B: There, but, yeah, yeah, well, I think it worked out pretty well. So you got there, Solana pays announced, and you were like. You were just like, okay, well, I'm just gonna build something with this.
00:09:04.702 - 00:09:32.692, Speaker A: No, not at all. There was kind of, like, two funny, like, touch points with Solanapay that, like, got me rolling. The first one was I, like, hopped out of mountain dow to go to the La Hacker house for, like, a two day stint. Cause I was, like, working with these people. And then as I was, like, about to leave, I remember my friend Greg from Solana News was like, you know, like, I missed, like, the news cycle on. On Solana pay. They must have had insider information.
00:09:32.692 - 00:09:50.924, Speaker A: That was a couple days after it was announced. And I was like, what do you mean, dude? It's been going on. He's like, what? I'm like, yeah. Are you not on Twitter? Do you not see this stuff? So that was funny. And so that kind of had it top of mind a little bit. But the idea for mountain pay was purely out of. It was Friday night.
00:09:50.924 - 00:10:32.902, Speaker A: It was the night of the first party we were having with parties every Friday or Saturday night, and I was grabbing a red bull from. They had this self service checkout kiosk, as I do. I just consumed just stupid amounts of Red Bull, and I was, like, buying another one. And you pay through square tap your phone. I don't know. I had a random idea that it was like, wouldn't it be hilarious if we rebuilt this self checkout experience and then just added the Solana pay stuff? Cause we're, like, all Solana people, like, here for a month. This is, like, the first week, and that would just be funny, right? And I told someone, I was like, I'm just gonna do it.
00:10:32.902 - 00:10:53.454, Speaker A: And they're like, that's hilarious. Do it. And then. So on Sunday, my boy Scott was in town, and we were at the hacker house, just, like, trying to think of, like, things to work on for Riptide. And we were, like, skating through all these, like, different ideas on the creator tokens or. I don't remember, like, all the different things. And it was like, what if we do that, like, point of sale thing? That'd be cool.
00:10:53.454 - 00:10:59.998, Speaker A: Like, and then, whatever. It's like, we could probably build this in, like, a two day stint. Like, not a big deal, and, yeah, that's why we built it.
00:11:00.046 - 00:11:26.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember, like, starting to see, like, a couple days after Solanapay launched. Like, I started to see all these videos of people, like, like, filming themselves and you guys, like, paying with Solanapay. I was like, this is crazy. This just came out. I can't believe. Well, I could believe that you had put that together already, but. And then from there, it's kind of like Solana Pay's kind of really gained a ton of traction, but you were really the first person to come out and be like, look, hey, guys, I did it.
00:11:26.474 - 00:11:31.850, Speaker B: And, like, it's actually live in this place right now, and it's still there to this day. Like, they keep that.
00:11:32.042 - 00:11:57.198, Speaker A: Yeah. As far as I know, our customer success could use some work. And so I haven't followed up with them in like, a couple weeks, but we got them set up with our new version, which was, like, a more self service thing. So as far as I know, it's still running there. There was even, like a week where it wasn't working. And Barrett was, like, texting me nonstop, like, bro, like, you need to get this working again because I need this. And so that's that classic, like, build something.
00:11:57.198 - 00:12:01.310, Speaker A: People would be like, upset if it goes away. And so we did that.
00:12:01.422 - 00:12:30.358, Speaker B: Yeah. So you did this in a short amount of time. And, like, since then, like, there was a lot left in the hackathon to go. So since that first day or that you got that live, I guess you've been gotten to doing a ton of work up until the point where you made your final submission. Tell us a little bit about mountain pay and what work was involved and what are the features and maybe what's the future of Mountainpay?
00:12:30.526 - 00:12:59.266, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So the first out the gate was just, it's an iOS point of sale app that enables users to use Solana pay to pay. And then the second thing is that as square integration. So it uses. We use the square APIs to tie it into your current point of sale system, so the transactions show up in line. Chase bought a Red bull here for $3 with his Mastercard, and then he bought a cookie for a dollar using Solana pay. And so that was, that was the kind of core thing.
00:12:59.266 - 00:13:40.058, Speaker A: And we had built it, like, specifically for the shop. We got a bunch of inbound of, like, how can I set this up? How can I do it? So we had to take a step back and use a couple of weeks to, like, make it more robust and, like, actually usable and, like, self service, which was like our, like, kind of base for what we wanted to submit to. The hackathon was just like a usable point of sale by everyone. It's still in test flight. And then Solanapay evolved to, like, a new spec while we were there and then, like, immediately became, like, gassed on that. And, like, ever since, like, the wheels have been, like, turning there and then that, like, initial, like, spec change is what led us to, like, where we are today, which is honestly, like. And not a lot of people know this, but we're, like, more of, like, an API company now.
00:13:40.058 - 00:13:43.154, Speaker A: We're more of, like, SaaS APIs and stuff like that.
00:13:43.234 - 00:13:54.698, Speaker B: I guess doing the API side makes it a little more versatile so that anybody can use it and they don't have to, like, use a specific sort of, like, device or framework or anything like that.
00:13:54.866 - 00:14:44.088, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. I think the APIs, to be honest with you, they came more out of this idea of, like, defensibility because with, like, a lot of the attention we got, it was like, what's the opportunity here? You know? Like, is there something, like, worth building out? And in that, like, there's a lot of things that can make you super existential, like, just square adding Solana pay themselves. And so, like, how do we actually build, like, a moat in this industry or, like, something. And so we're, like, this transaction request thing came up, which was, like, enables you to use APIs and so on a pay. What if we open that up to people and then let that be, like, our defense building and our moat? And so, like, we spent a lot of time thinking about what that API suite would look like, and then realize that, like, that's the bigger opportunity from our point of view. But, like, probably more importantly, it's, like, what we want to build. You know, in this space.
00:14:44.088 - 00:15:08.316, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of opportunities for a lot of people to participate and building out, like, the client that people would use. There's a lot of stuff that we didn't. We weren't interested in building, like, inventory management and tax reporting and accounting. Like, nah, right? I want to do the Solana stuff. And, like, the APIs is the Solana stuff. And so that's kind of where we're at now.
00:15:08.380 - 00:15:37.156, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, it makes sense. Here's the thing. Like, you build a project and you really, you don't want to start taking on things that you don't enjoy, because then you probably start. Stop enjoying your job. So, like, you do what excites you and then you offload or, like, allow sort of connection points for other people to build that stuff who see that opportunity. But it makes a lot of sense, you know, like, I've talked to people who have created businesses, and then they pull on. Maybe not this specifically, but, like, the tax stuff and all these different sort of inventory management.
00:15:37.156 - 00:15:42.624, Speaker B: And then it becomes like, I don't really like this anymore. This is not what I signed up for.
00:15:43.084 - 00:16:03.546, Speaker A: That's what was happening. And so it was, like, really had to, like, focus on, like, something specifically in there. And that's. We picked the APIs, um, and it's been cool. We've been working with, like, different protocols to, like, add them, their functionality to our APIs. And, yeah, it's just. It's been fun since we started focusing.
00:16:03.570 - 00:16:17.946, Speaker B: There obviously was the right move because you just to circle back to. This is like, you won the payments track of the riptide hackathon. There was a lot of competition. There was a lot of good, like, stuff in there. So I'm just curious, how did that feel when you saw that?
00:16:18.010 - 00:16:55.382, Speaker A: I'm, like, dumb competitive, you know? And so, like, it was so funny because it was like, it started off as, like, people are like, oh, you're gonna submit this to riptide? And it was like, yeah, probably, but, like, we're not really focused on that. And the closer we got to riptide, we're like, we wanna win, you know? And then, so, like, yeah, we had been paying a lot of attention to, like, other people that were building in this space, like, seeing, like, what. Where people's attention was the whole time. We were, like, I don't know, like, fairly confident we would do well to some extent. But then I think it was kind of up to, like, what did the judges value? Right. You don't. You don't.
00:16:55.382 - 00:17:25.070, Speaker A: You don't know, you know? But we were, like, super proud of what we built, and we're hoping other people saw, like, what we saw. And, like, seeing that we won the payments track, it was just like a pat on the back. It was like, we agree, you know? Yeah, that's kind of what it was. And there was, like, you know, like, some chest pounding. There was something like, yeah, like, yes, but I also think. I think the part I was, like, more stoked on was just, like, the attention that would follow and, like, knowing that we could, like, leverage that to build, like, something. Right.
00:17:25.070 - 00:17:37.670, Speaker A: Cause I think the attention is just, like, it's fuel, you know? And, like, it's not. You can't do it with only attention, you know, you have to follow it up. But, like, we knew it would, like, empower a lot of the things that we wanted to do.
00:17:37.742 - 00:18:01.846, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And I think these aren't necessarily your classic typical hackathon where you hack on some little thing for a week or a month. These, these sort of events are, are actually catalysts to build real businesses. And this is kind of meant to be inspirational to developers that are watching this, that may or may not have dipped their toes into Solana. Maybe they have, but they haven't gotten anywhere. These stories are super inspirational. So I want to put it in context.
00:18:01.846 - 00:18:13.390, Speaker B: Like, what is the timeframe from the day that TJ wrote his first piece of, or read his first Solana doc to winning riptide payments track? What's that timeframe?
00:18:13.542 - 00:18:41.766, Speaker A: September, August. I was, I was reading, I was staying up late. I was still working at the startup, and I was, like, staying up till like, three, four in the morning reading that classic, like, Paul article on doing an escrow. It was partly that. It was partly that Paki podcast on Solana Summer that was, like, super dope. I remember I was at, like, the gym, and I was listening to him talk about the DJ Napes mint. And, like, two weeks prior, I was at Miami hack week.
00:18:41.766 - 00:18:57.966, Speaker A: It was like I was chilling with Barrett. I met him for the first time. We had met throughout friend Ebe. Shout out, Ebe. And it was just me, Barrett, Edgar and Ebe in this apartment, and they were just talking about crypto, and I knew nothing, so I wanted to fit in. And I was like, oh, yeah, I bought some ethereum lately. I thought I would impress him.
00:18:57.966 - 00:19:21.036, Speaker A: And he's like, not even looking at him. He's like, fuck Ethereum. And I was like, what? And he just turns around, he goes, Solana. I was like, what is Solana? I thought it was like some, like, shit coin. And that was just when it got on my map. And then I, like, saw the Paki thing, I did that. And then, like, all these nft things were popping up, and I'm like, all right, what's going on? And then candy machine pops up.
00:19:21.036 - 00:19:39.984, Speaker A: So I'm reading that contract, and I'm reading Levi's thing and trying to set one up for myself. And all these, it just feels like explosions all around me. And I'm like, what is this world? And people are just shipping and I can't keep up. And it was overwhelming. And then I quit.
00:19:41.224 - 00:19:48.880, Speaker B: So it's been about, like, from zero to hero and, like, seven months, basically, is what I'm hearing right here. Seven or eight?
00:19:48.912 - 00:20:04.216, Speaker A: Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I feel like I got onboarded, like, fairly quick. Like, I feel like I was, like, doing stuff to me that felt, like, mattered. Like, immediately. Like, all that iOS stuff that I was doing, like, to me felt, like groundbreaking.
00:20:04.360 - 00:20:04.912, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:05.008 - 00:20:11.354, Speaker A: Like, and I felt like a hero then. Honestly, that, that stuff made me feel like more of a hero than what I felt like with riptide.
00:20:11.504 - 00:20:25.294, Speaker B: Really? So it was more so just like that, you win riptide. You're like, wow, this is like, I got this thing. But the more part for you was the personal win of actually just like, starting on this new journey and figuring out how to build on Solana.
00:20:25.374 - 00:20:50.210, Speaker A: Like I said, I'm dummy competitive. So winning riptide was great. It was a good job, pal. But with mountain pay, I don't feel like I've done anything yet. I think there's opportunities, too, and we're on a path to actually really contribute to, like, the Solana ecosystem. But I don't feel like I've had a major accomplishment there yet. But with the iOS stuff, like, I totally did.
00:20:50.210 - 00:21:05.130, Speaker A: Like, I, like, from, like, native iOS code, like, minted an NFT through candy machine, I figured out how to talk to, like, anchor programs from, like, native iOS code. And, like, that to me was like, that gave me so much energy.
00:21:05.202 - 00:21:18.618, Speaker B: So tell, tell me about that. Like, you started building on Solana. Like, did you start messing around with Russ, did you start messing around with anchor? Or did you kind of like, go straight to those swift SDKs that existed? Like, what was your process for, for getting rolling on salon?
00:21:18.666 - 00:21:42.460, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. That's like a, that's like, a great thing to, like, preface here is like, I've done barely any rust. I haven't shipped a smart contract to Mainnet. I mostly like client work. So, like, there's massive opportunities in the space to, like, really participate and have impact just doing, like, client work. That being said, like, the way I really learned it was just wanting to write an iOS app that would work with Solana.
00:21:42.460 - 00:22:30.012, Speaker A: And so I found a couple of open source swift packages that was doing iOS transaction stuff. And so, like, that's how I learned, like, what a transaction object looked like and, like, where you serialize it and, like, how you add accounts to that and, like, what's an account and what's borscht coding? You know, like, all of that stuff I had, I just learned because, like, I had to, to make an iOS app that, like, talk to anchor. And so, like, me and my friend Michael, we went to college together, and so we were up to like four in the morning, like, like, for like weeks, just like printing out transaction objects in JavaScript, like, on the anchor thing and, like, figuring out how we, how do we bridge that to, like, iOS and that was like the coolest.
00:22:30.108 - 00:23:09.872, Speaker B: And like this, this is exactly the point we've talked about a couple of times on this on the show and I say it on my twitter all the time. You just won reptied payments track and you'd never shipped a smart contract. How? Well, it's because not everybody needs to be this guy who writes the smart contracts. You just need to know how to talk to them using these different APIs, swift JavaScript, there's a C sharp SDK, there's a unity one built on top of that. Like there's a Kotlin one. They're all out there. And you can learn Solana and like in a way you're comfortable, which is in your native language, and you're talking about just like doing print lines and printing out and just reading like, what is this object? And like, now I get it.
00:23:10.048 - 00:23:37.702, Speaker A: Yeah, that was the process and it was great, you know, and I think there's like, we have a long way to go before, like, developers can like, step in and build like incredibly easily and efficiently. But the process is still fun, you know, and there's like a lot of like, toys you get to use when, like building this stuff. A lot of like, exposure. You feel super low level and. Yeah, like anyone, like, they encourage everyone to just like dig in and start building shit.
00:23:37.838 - 00:23:47.354, Speaker B: In your opinion, like, what are some of those things that need to improve to make this easier for the new guys or the, the old guys? It doesn't really matter. Like, what needs to happen and, like, what do we need?
00:23:47.694 - 00:24:30.542, Speaker A: Error messages, you know, like, like, it is like, you will get like error a four and there's nowhere to go. Like, you know, and you're like, digging around. I'm like, you literally got to like, clone the repo and like go, like, line by line and figure out like, what's that error? Like, what are we doing? It's fun, you know, and, like, from when I got into it to like, what? Like, Armani's done with anchor now and like the anchor books that's there, the Solana cookbook, that's all there now, you know, and, like, so it's, it's easier to do it now. And like, even like, when I try to do more on chain stuff or like build out, like, stuff that I'm not comfortable with, like, I'm able to go reference those materials, but, like, they weren't there in like September.
00:24:30.638 - 00:24:31.742, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, and like, that was kind.
00:24:31.758 - 00:24:53.116, Speaker A: Of fun though, you know, it was like, it was like a point in time and like, I was always envious of, like, people that got to code in, like, machine code. Cause they had to, you know, I'm like, what a point in time that must have been to, like, get to be a part of that. And, like, that's why I started building in Solana was like, I saw that point in time again. I thought Solana was gonna pop. And I was like, I'm not missing it.
00:24:53.180 - 00:25:05.684, Speaker B: You were basically like, I see Solana. I see that, like, not everything's been created and there's massive opportunities, and I'm gonna carve myself out a slice of that and, like, just, like, do it. So it's pretty crazy to be talking about this now.
00:25:05.804 - 00:25:07.876, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been a journey. Yeah.
00:25:07.940 - 00:25:26.680, Speaker B: And a lot of this was all discord support. It was a huge pain in the ass. You answer the same questions 5000 times a day. Shout out to, like, the Devrel team at Solana labs that, like, really just spent way too much time in discord. And the core engineers that shouldn't be in there all shout out Allen. Yeah. Allen has actually been, like, obviously incredible.
00:25:26.752 - 00:25:44.824, Speaker A: Fun story in that with, like, alan. He. We were working on that iOS stuff to, like, dumb hours night. I think it might have been like two in the morning. And we were, like, having these, like, errors we could not figure out. And so we, like, posted in the discord and, like, alan answered and he's like, hey, like, we're, like, going back and forth with this guy. Didn't know him at all.
00:25:44.824 - 00:26:24.680, Speaker A: This is our first thing. He's like, I'm happy to hop on a call with you to help you sort it out. We were on that call for 3 hours. But that to me, is, like, such a story of, like, people in Solana. There is so many people that just, like, are cool with just helping you and they're, like, in the weeds with you. And, like, it's that developer ecosystem that, like, attracted me and I think is gonna attract, like, so many people, like, after me, which, like, to your credit, I think you've set up a lot of it. You know, being, like, the dev relations at Solana, like, just creating the environment for those developers to thrive and giving them the resources.
00:26:24.680 - 00:26:31.544, Speaker A: I think that's where this has come from. But, yeah, that was just a monster classic Solana moment for me that I wanted to highlight.
00:26:31.624 - 00:26:59.698, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. There's a lot of people. It started with Toli and Raj, and then that sort of attitude and kind of just kind of welcomeness humor came down to me and Armani and so many different people. It feels like you can, like, approach anybody in the ecosystem. And I agree. I think this sort of tone and vibe is what will attract a lot of younger developers. Yeah, there's, there's lots of different sort of complaints out there.
00:26:59.698 - 00:27:10.934, Speaker B: One of the biggest ones we've been hearing a lot is about tooling. If you agree with that, like, like what web tooling or blockchain tooling are we missing right now at Solana? Do you have anything like, personally that you would like to see?
00:27:12.194 - 00:27:34.584, Speaker A: No, I don't have, like, the most robust engineering background. Like, like when I was at Apple. Like, we use apple internal tools, so, like, that was all, like, I really knew. And so, like, even now, like, I'll be like, coding on something with someone at a hackathon and they're like, wait, you're not using this plugin. You're not using the anchor plugin for, like, versus code? I'm like, no. Like, what is that?
00:27:34.624 - 00:27:35.752, Speaker B: You're just old school.
00:27:35.928 - 00:27:47.620, Speaker A: Yeah, they're like, baby, come here. Like, and they set me up with some stuff. So that's so cool. I think. I think examples are going to be great. Like, I think just like getting examples out there for people so that they could, like, learn that they can do it too is going to be really cool.
00:27:47.732 - 00:27:48.700, Speaker B: And self onboard.
00:27:48.772 - 00:28:16.472, Speaker A: Yeah, self onboarding is massive. And that's one of the ways we want to go with mountain pay because we're just like a set of APIs. I think we can open up these APIs like, iOS native developers to be able to build dapps. You know, they don't need to do the exact like, transaction building. Like, we can have like a, just a normal API that lets them build the transaction themselves. So that's one of the directions we definitely want to go into. And we feel like can bring native developers to Solana, hopefully.
00:28:16.568 - 00:28:52.162, Speaker B: Yeah, it's about giving the tools, the education to onboard people like mountain pay and the rest of the ecosystem who then drives in the users and then like, that, it just kind of like, spreads outwardly from there. So it's pretty incredible to watch right now. I'm not going to say, like, I started last May about one. Next month will be my one year. And like, the difference in one year has made. Like you said, even in September, you didn't have half the things that are available now. Like, it's like it's happening at the speed of light and it's, who knows? In like one year from now, it's going to be again unrecognizable.
00:28:52.162 - 00:28:56.810, Speaker B: So, I mean, it'll be unrecognizable in, like, six months, most likely, or less. We'll see.
00:28:56.882 - 00:29:09.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just being along for the journey, I feel, like, grateful, you know, like, what just what a point in time that we're in. I was talking with Edgar the other day is like, do you got to remember, like, we're in the good old days right now, I guess, like, to.
00:29:09.890 - 00:29:30.210, Speaker B: Round this off and you kind of already touched on this, and I always do this at the end of every single episode of the show, is to just kind of give some advice to whoever you want to give to. Advice to. Maybe it's the new devs looking to come into blockchain that might be scared or intimidated by just the name. Blockchain scares some people.
00:29:30.362 - 00:30:04.244, Speaker A: I mean, just start. Just start and just build. There's so many opportunities within yourself to, like, push things off and, like, it's so easy to, like, complain or, like, give yourself reasons to not build stuff. Even within myself, every day I catch myself either complaining or, like, giving excuses or whatever. But, like, reality is, like, just build. Because, like, when you just start building, like, you'll figure it out. You can ask the questions, you'll get there.
00:30:04.244 - 00:30:09.580, Speaker A: And then, like, that building, like, really, like, gives you momentum to keep going.
00:30:09.652 - 00:30:10.444, Speaker B: Yeah, man.
00:30:10.604 - 00:30:21.100, Speaker A: Yeah. And it attracts people to you, and then those people are going to give you energy, and it just, like, it all cycles, right. But you have to, like, be the one to start.
00:30:21.292 - 00:30:34.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I don't think anybody's really given that advice. And it is like, we're all engineers. We've all just put things off. We've all have 200 projects that we started one night and then never got back to. So it's really just getting started and just following through.
00:30:34.524 - 00:30:50.900, Speaker A: Yeah, don't be afraid to chase the energy, you know? Like, there's so many things I've, like, tried doing in Solana that, like, I would work on for a week and then stop. But, like, even now, I go back to them and they're just, like, tools in the belt, you know? And you'll be able to leverage learnings, like, later on.
00:30:50.972 - 00:31:07.320, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Well, TJ, congratulations for winning the riptide payments track with mountain pay. Glad to get you on the show. Glad to have a conversation. Like, love the energy. Just keep it up, man. And, like, thanks again for.
00:31:07.320 - 00:31:09.480, Speaker B: For doing what you do and thanks for being here.
00:31:09.672 - 00:31:22.912, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I appreciate. Appreciate the opportunity. I feel this is definitely, like, the longest we've been able to chat for how long we've known each other. You know, it's like, funny, I feel like we kept missing each other in mind. So I'm glad. I'm glad we got this opportunity, and hopefully I'll see you in the Bahamas.
00:31:23.008 - 00:31:23.744, Speaker B: Thanks for coming on.
