00:00:03.320 - 00:00:19.054, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. How's it going? My name's Ali. I'm from reciprocal ventures. We're an early stage, thesis driven investment firm. That has been supporting Solana since the beginning. And, yeah, today, we're very excited to have our panelists today. And so maybe we'll kick it off with some intros.
00:00:19.054 - 00:00:22.686, Speaker A: So Michael from Marinade would love a quick intro. Sure.
00:00:22.830 - 00:00:44.744, Speaker B: Thanks for having me first. So, my name is Michael. I'm a contributor at Marinade. And Marinade is a stake optimization platform on Solana. That tracks all the Solana validators. And automatically delegates, not to one, but to hundreds. The best performing validators we've been around for more than two years now.
00:00:44.744 - 00:01:04.570, Speaker B: It's completely open source. We are the bootstrap community bootstrap protocol out there. Currently the number one TVL protocol in Solana. With more than 300 million TVL in it. And decentralizing the network with close to 9 million sol across hundreds of the best validators. So, yeah, glad to be here.
00:01:04.642 - 00:01:07.346, Speaker A: Great. And then we have Michael from lane. Yeah.
00:01:07.370 - 00:01:25.564, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. Also, Michael and I run a validator called Lane on Solana Mainnet since August 2021. So, actually launched the same week as Marinade Epoch 216, for those counting in epochs. And also operate a website called Stakewiz, which some of you might know.
00:01:26.744 - 00:01:30.208, Speaker A: Yeah. And then last but not least, we have Nicholas from Swissborg.
00:01:30.296 - 00:01:40.684, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'm Nicholas Swissborg, CTO. And Swissborg is a consumer app in Europe with 800,000 users.
00:01:41.064 - 00:02:01.684, Speaker A: Nice. Well, thank you so much for those intros, and thank you for being here today. We really appreciate it. So maybe let's start off with Michael from Marinade. You sit in a pretty unique position. And so maybe you could just quickly walk us through the difference between liquid staking as well as versus native staking. And what are some of the pros and cons of each?
00:02:02.064 - 00:02:23.508, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I think the best to put it, to set the context is to look back, say, two and a half years ago, when there was no marinade, no liquid staking, where you could use native staking. Right. And then we found that three main points with traditional native staking. Is that you need to choose one of those 2000 validators. So it starts with confusion. There is just too many validators.
00:02:23.508 - 00:03:10.950, Speaker B: You need to choose one. So you choose one. And then you need to track those validators. Are they changing commission? Are they going down? So it goes on with this anxiety of not knowing, am I getting rewards or not? What's going on? So then the third thing is that people end up sticking with one of the big ones because it's, like, safe, but it centralizes the network. So these three pain points, we saw them back in February 2021, around the Solana hackathon that we participated in and said, look, everything can be solved through this automated staking strategy. And that's why back then, we launched liquid staking and this token MSOL that represents staked SOL, but it's diversified into hundreds of letters, skipping the big ones. So trying to do something for the network to make it healthy.
00:03:10.950 - 00:03:58.770, Speaker B: And at the same time, the second biggest value prop of liquid staking is that you unlock the liquidity. So, previously, you would only put, like, you would lock up your stake in the network, and it sits there. So back in Solana defi summer, the users needed to decide, should I stake my sol at some staking rewards rate, or should I rather put it in defi and use it there and get some yield over there? And we combined this together with mstol, so that you can put sol in marinate in liquid staking protocol, get msol, and then put this into defi and put it on top of it. So, yeah, if I have to compare it, those would be the two things, how to look at the native staking, the disadvantages, and then the advantages of liquid staking. And we might get to some, again, disadvantages of liquid staking later on.
00:03:58.882 - 00:04:19.318, Speaker A: Okay, great. No, thank you for that. And then, you know, Michael from Lane, could you explain the value proposition of basically creating a single validator LST? And it's actually something pretty unique that we haven't seen before. So, yeah, just curious, what were your thoughts behind that? And why did you decide to launch an LST for a validator?
00:04:19.406 - 00:05:04.422, Speaker C: Yeah, we launched Lanesaw, which was the first back then, single validator LST about almost a year ago, just before breakpoint last year. And so LST is a liquid staking token like MSO. And single validator LST is just a stake pool that delegates to just one validator. So it's different in the sense that it doesn't diversify your stake across many validators. So you still get the choice of which validator you want to stake with, but you get the benefit of the liquidity. So you have a token that's in your wallet that you can use across DeFi platforms, and there's liquidity fragmentation that comes with that. Because if every validator does this, you have thousands of different tokens with different levels of liquidity.
00:05:04.422 - 00:05:20.834, Speaker C: So there's some great protocols like sanctum, which are addressing this problem by providing a unified liquidity layer. So it's really a way that you provide users the choice of still sticking with a single validator while having the liquidity of an LST.
00:05:21.924 - 00:05:40.704, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's really impressive and very exciting to have that and see more validators actually launch their own lsts. Could be pretty awesome to see. And then Nicholas from Swissborg, how are you thinking about leveraging lsts? And how do you think about lsts versus just staking on your platform?
00:05:41.364 - 00:06:24.442, Speaker D: Yeah, so basically we offer the possibility to our users to leverage both. But it's just that like with LST, we are unlocking new use case. So typically there is always the questions on how we can earn more. And the thing is that when you are staking, there is nothing else that can be done. Once you have LSTs, then you can introduce all the deFi use case and build all the strategies around that. That is definitely the first part where we are seeing we can offer to our users different risk profile of what they want to do. And if they are comfortable with embracing the risk of defi, then they can get a higher reward of that.
00:06:24.442 - 00:06:34.554, Speaker D: And what we've been seeing is that lsts are now powering Defi across various ecosystems, and we're very excited about everything we can build on Solana with that.
00:06:34.594 - 00:06:48.182, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. Thanks for that answer. So, for marinade, could you tell us a little bit about Marinade's native product as well as the evolution of your product since the Defi summer days?
00:06:48.358 - 00:07:37.706, Speaker B: Sure. So everybody probably knows marinade, or those that know Marinade know it for this liquid staking product. Since two years ago, we pioneered the liquid staking on Solana, and we launched MSOL to the masses there to benefit both from decentralized staking and this capital efficiency, so that you can use Amsoil in Defi at the same time. So everybody knows Marinate for this. It's just that we've looked through those two years, we've seen many people using Amsoil in DeFi to borrow against it, to provide liquidity, even to buy it on exchanges, to onramp, to Solana. Already in the stake version, we've seen many people using this. But also, even now, currently there is more than 50% amsoil that's just sitting on the wallet.
00:07:37.706 - 00:08:02.926, Speaker B: We believe it's more or less split. So 50% in Defi and the rest was sitting on the wallet. And if you look at the whole context of Solana staking as it is, we've grown back then at the end of 2021, from zero to 6 million sold within three months. And let's face it, we stayed there at marinate. It was like flatlined for two years. And we've been asking ourselves, why is that? Why even today, there is only, say, 2% of all stake sold. It's liquid.
00:08:02.926 - 00:08:40.778, Speaker B: So we've been asking this question and talking to many institutions, many stakers, what is it? And we believe that marinate introduced amsel and liquid staking to represent those two value props. And one was this capital efficiency. So that you have, you are, you can use Amsoil in Defi and you are instantly liquid. But the two was this decentralized way of staking, this optimized, automated staking strategy. And we put this together. So what we've done recently, three months ago, we've launched this product. We call it marinate native, which decouples these two value props.
00:08:40.778 - 00:09:23.430, Speaker B: Since some of the funds and some institutions, they didn't care that much about being super capital efficient. They didn't want to use DeFi, but they were very much risk averse. So they didn't want this smart contract risk, even if it's negligible. They didn't want to use it for this additional risk. And at the same time, they cared a lot about decentralizing the stake, about helping the network to be more healthy and more decentralized. So we said, look, why don't we scrape out amsoil, this smart contract? And we introduced marinate native, which avoids completely the smart contract risk and allows anybody. So we expire to those 98% people that are staking the native way.
00:09:23.430 - 00:09:52.894, Speaker B: We are allowing them to tap into this decentralized way of staking to those smaller yet reliable operators without being exposed to a smart contract risk. So that's what we recently did. Like learning throughout the journey that there are different people with different needs, and somebody might use the liquid staking with amsoil and use it in defi. But if you're not using amsoil and Defi and it only sits on your wallet, we feel like it may be better to switch over marinate native where you are not exposed.
00:09:53.554 - 00:10:22.754, Speaker A: Awesome. That's pretty exciting. Update. Seems like a lot of work and in such a small amount of time. So, props to your team. So, Lynn, for lane, going back to your LST, right? So obviously, with validators launching their own lsts, that probably creates the problem of fragmentation in the market. So, curious, what are some of the problems with liquidity being fragmented in this industry, and how are you envisioning this being solved?
00:10:23.134 - 00:11:14.054, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a big issue because basically, if you have Lanesol, any other single validator, LST, and I think there's only two at the moment, Lanesaw and cogent Sol, and you want to go and you want to swap that for Sol or USDC on Jupiter or some other exchange, you get a really bad exchange rate, possibly not even have any liquidity to exchange it at all. So that's really a problem and kind of destroys our point of even having an LST. And so sanctum is a protocol that provides a unified liquidity layer which is plugged into Jupiter. So that solves it a lot. The other option is obviously, of course, providing native liquidity. Another thing is that after launching Lanesaw a year ago, at the time, there wasn't really any concept of liquid stake, but to a directed validator. But since then we have marinate directed staking that's also come about.
00:11:14.054 - 00:11:56.432, Speaker C: And Blaze saw directed staking, which actually allows people to direct stake to a certain validator using their kind of the larger liquid staking protocols, which is also a great tool that's available to them. But it's really, like you say, Michael said, everyone has different use cases, different preferences, different risk tolerances. So some people, they have a validator that they trust, that they have been staking with for years. So we have many great stakers that have been using us. So they might prefer to use Lanesol, something that is issued by us and administered by us. Others might know and trust marinade and they prefer to use their solution. So the fragmentation is a real issue.
00:11:56.432 - 00:12:08.338, Speaker C: And because we expecting more lsts, single validator lsds to come about, that's where this unified liquidity layer that sanctum is building. And other solutions that will come about in future are going to be really important.
00:12:08.506 - 00:12:30.364, Speaker A: Okay, great. And then, Niko, as a platform, you probably work with multiple lsts across different blockchains. So a, maybe you could talk us through how has that experience been working with different blockchains with their very various lsts, and then, you know, related own to that. But how do you choose which lsts to work with?
00:12:30.944 - 00:13:23.508, Speaker D: That's a good question. So, like the. I mean, working with lsts on Solana is extremely smooth. And it's something that, like, you know, as a Solana community, sometimes very good to kind of like, emphasize this and keep this in mind, because, like, when we look at the risk profile, because this as a consumer app is always like the key for us, like, you know, in the last cycle and the downfall and stuff has highlighted all the issues and everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. And so, to navigate that smoothly, we do a lot of due diligence on various protocols. And the thing is that, like, usually the question that comes up is, like, why is LST adoption going slowly on Solana? While. Because, like, the native staking protocol is already very good.
00:13:23.508 - 00:14:20.404, Speaker D: But the point is also that, like, this makes the lsts on Solana extremely safe compared to other protocols. Because, like, you know, we can take examples on, like Ethereum, Polkadot avalanche, where you either need to do like some cross chains, you know, between the beacon chain or the execution chain on Ethereum, or various things. And this always introduces some friction and complexity. And the complexity is the enemy of security. So as everything can be done in a unifying layer in a program on Solana, it makes it very safe. And so that makes it that, like, we can very easily afford to offer this to our users. And then regarding a second part of the question is that we have the security, but also the liquidity.
00:14:20.404 - 00:14:53.414, Speaker D: And that is what we are going to look at. Because now, when you are choosing an LST, usually what you want is to not have a locking period, and you want to be able to get this instant liquidity. So the old key then is going to be, ok, we're moving away from native staking. But then I get this huge advantage, because if I have a trading strategy or things that look like that, not being able to trade at certain point in time is also a risk that.
00:14:53.454 - 00:14:54.502, Speaker B: You have to hedge for.
00:14:54.598 - 00:16:13.494, Speaker D: And that is instant liquidity. And so this is where we are going to look at deeply, is like, what is the level of liquidity for an LST? And how is this liquidity holding in face of big events? And so typically, again, on Solana, with the introduction of sanctum, as was mentioning, Michael, the liquidity is getting much more robust in face of major events such as like a blow of a sacks or things like that. And we see that this makes it that, like, it's getting very attractive to kind of build on top of lsds and Solana. And so typically, one thing that we are looking now at Swissborg is to kind of create bundles of assets. And if one of the underlying is Sol, we can definitely now replace it with, for instance, MSOL and be capable of trading in most of the conditions that, like, you know, are going to exist. And that makes it that, like, we can start to introduce those very exciting products that would be a bundle with an LST in it instead of the underlying assets, and still get your strategy but the benefit of the yield, that is something that is very unique. And I feel like it's very important to emphasis that at the moment, to my knowledge, it's only possible.
00:16:14.874 - 00:16:36.084, Speaker A: Great. So, back to marinade. So, when thinking about lsts, I'm sure you've spent a lot of time thinking about the problems, the problems of native staking that are solved by lsts. So, could you expand on that a little bit, whether it includes in terms of selection, performance, or even centralization issues?
00:16:36.704 - 00:18:06.238, Speaker B: Yeah, so we touched on this a bit earlier, but once again, when you're exposed to staking the traditional way, and you go through your wallet, is this endless list of 2000 validators that you need to choose from. Right? So how do you pick the right one? And they all look great on paper, because the yield, I mean, it looks great, but tomorrow the node goes offline or it changes commission. And we call it like this Schrodinger's box, like this Schrodinger's way of staking, because until you check on your staking position, you don't know kind of am I making staking rewards or not? So it's this constant not knowing, this constant anxiety that's there. So, even if you picked a validator, you're there with this validator, you need to check on them, since maybe you can spread it manually to five or ten validators, but it's super cumbersome, super manual way how to do it, and then you need to check on them. So once again, this led many people to stake with the big ogs, validators, let's face it, or even worse, maybe even through the exchanges. So all of this we felt like, what about we introduced this one click solution where people click in, it's like on chain, they get to keep the custody, and at the same time they can stake the decentralized way, because nobody is going to do due diligence on those smaller validators. Nobody's going to do it.
00:18:06.238 - 00:18:34.796, Speaker B: They don't trust it. So how marinate works behind the scenes is that it tracks all those 2000 validators of Solana. Each epoch, it tracks where they are geographically positioned, what's their commission, what's their uptime, all these things. And it scores the validators. So then each epoch it can find the best hundred of those. So it's like an index of the top performers, and this index changes across the time. So there is a new validator coming in.
00:18:34.796 - 00:19:03.036, Speaker B: They don't need to do any handshake with marinate. It automatically stakes to them if they are performing well, and it unstakes from the ones that, for example, might be going down. So that was the big thing, big innovation that started with amsoil liquid staking. And we only took this automated staking strategy and also allowed recently to use it without being exposed to any smart contract whatsoever, thanks to this native feature of Solana staking as it is. So, yeah, this might be it.
00:19:03.140 - 00:19:15.884, Speaker A: Great. So back to lane. Why haven't other kind of validators launched lsts, and what do you see as the likelihood of other single validators launching their own lsts in the near future?
00:19:16.304 - 00:20:25.810, Speaker C: So it was an interesting situation that led to single validator lsts even becoming a topic, and it really has to do with just how the chain is actually handling all the stake accounts that exist. So, shortly before breakpoint last year, this is when this, this topic really became quite important, because we were seeing that over 600,000 stake accounts existing on Solana Mainnet was really starting to impact the performance of the chain. So at that time, there was this narrative that, okay, we need to actually find a solution which will reduce the amount of stake accounts and also, at the same time, provide users with this ability to maintain the liquidity and participate, participate in DeFi. So Lanesaw was really launched as kind of an experiment to see how this would work as a single validator LST, and to address the topic of kind of composability. I think that's really important on Solana, is that all LST's, almost all lsts use the same stake pool program, which is an open source program. It's been audited many times, and it means that all the tokens have the same properties and are interchangeable. And that really helps with the composability of the liquidity.
00:20:25.810 - 00:21:09.310, Speaker C: Liquidity. But that is a multivalidated stake pool. And now, and that's what Lanesaw uses. Now there's actually a single validator stake pool, which is a dedicated program which will make it even easier for validators in future to launch their single validator lsts. And while it's been kind of a year of slow progress in that kind of area, I think in the next year or two, we're going to eventually see the entire chain potentially moving towards a situation where every validator functions natively through their own LST. And this functionality has to then also become much simpler and easier to use in the wallets and for the users in the UX.
00:21:09.462 - 00:21:26.794, Speaker A: Okay, great. Looks like we have a few minutes left, so maybe just like a quick firearm, but we'll start with marinade and go down the line. But like, you know, what do you see as like, the future of lsts? Maybe like one year from now, like, what would you like to see happen? Or where do you envision, like, the LST market going?
00:21:26.954 - 00:22:01.558, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good one. So I would hope for the Solana defi to pick up, since is this constant question, do we need defi to pick it up for LST's or is it vice versa? It's a chicken and egg problem. So, yeah, I would love for first, for network to be stable for enough longer of a time. I think we are getting there. From perspective of decentralization. We are talking a lot about the number of Nakamoto coefficients. It's been mentioned a lot, but to me, it only measures the nodes, the stake on the nodes.
00:22:01.558 - 00:22:32.452, Speaker B: If you look at detail, at some problems that are there. For example, there are 2000 validators on Solana, but we've looked at like, how many of those really make reasonable profit. It's in the hundreds. It's really not more than, maybe not, maybe in less than 500 wallets make reasonable profit on Solana. So we would love to double, triple this number over the next twelve months. I call this like three to one framework. So, you know, it would take three data centers, two countries and one client to cause some problems on Solana, let's face it.
00:22:32.452 - 00:22:49.274, Speaker B: So we are working on it. We've seen the progress with fire dancer, with multiple clients now. So I think this is great. So we just needed to be more resilient for the network from different angles. That's what I would love to see over the next couple of years. It will not happen overnight for sure.
00:22:50.174 - 00:22:51.230, Speaker A: Lane. Yeah.
00:22:51.262 - 00:23:30.666, Speaker C: I think lsts are going to continue to grow, and it's important to understand the difference from, say, ethereum, why lsts are not as dominant. That's just because of how staking, native staking, existed first. But we're going to see new LST protocols launch in the next year, I'm sure. And we're going to see more and more lsts launch incentive programs through points, through marinade, MDE incentives. And it's going to become more and more interesting because we're going to see new yield strategies involving complex combinations of LST's and the incentives that they're offering and how they are used in DeFi. But for sure, it's going to become a bigger and bigger component of staking as a whole and of Defi.
00:23:30.770 - 00:23:32.530, Speaker A: Great. And Niko.
00:23:32.682 - 00:24:09.942, Speaker D: Yeah. As I said earlier, is like, I believe that like on Solana, the two key elements of the lsts are, like, the liquidity and the security of the program by itself. And those are going to be an enabler. Once everyone truly understand that you can safely kind of replace Sol with, for instance, Msoul is going to unlock new level of compostability and strategy that, like, can be built on top, like financial strategies, and people are going to get, like, more adoption of it. I'm kind of, like, very obvious about that.
00:24:10.118 - 00:24:12.806, Speaker A: All right, well, round of applause for our speakers. Thank you so much for joining us.
00:24:12.830 - 00:24:13.014, Speaker D: Thank you.
