00:03:04.684 - 00:04:02.484, Speaker A: I'd like to dedicate this song to every single one of you in this room and you guys watching. This is a song called how far I've come. And it's a song about just appreciating one's journey. I know we can get very frustrated with ourselves, very cruel to ourselves often at times, and that's a common occurrence with me. And, yeah, I wrote this song inspired by a phone call I had with a friend who I was basically whinging, saying, like, I worked so hard, and I really want to make this work and be here, you know? And my friend Claire kind of said, well, every time you think like that, just look back to when you were 14 and look how far you've come. And that's something we don't always appreciate. It's like, we're doing fucking great, but we always want something more, you know? And sometimes you just need to appreciate the journey you've been on so far.
00:04:02.484 - 00:04:12.664, Speaker A: And let's face it, we've just been through the worst bear market of all time in crypto, and we're still here, so let's fucking go. So this is how far I've come and I hope you like it.
00:04:25.144 - 00:04:47.304, Speaker B: It takes a few mirror to piece it all together sometimes it takes rock bottom to put the pen to paper I didn't dare to let myself believe I couldn't see the forest through the trees.
00:04:54.604 - 00:04:59.348, Speaker D: I didn't think it was gonna work out I didn't know I was.
00:04:59.396 - 00:05:02.388, Speaker B: About to find out through the mistakes.
00:05:02.556 - 00:05:27.994, Speaker D: Or the bad days when we get through all of the growing pains I felt like a fake felt like a liar put on her face but I was just getting by it somehow looking back to when I was young I can't believe how far I've come how far I've come?
00:05:36.054 - 00:05:48.094, Speaker B: That you will have the beauty like a work of art they will tell a story sometimes it takes a broken.
00:05:48.134 - 00:05:51.054, Speaker C: Road to show you where you need.
00:05:51.094 - 00:05:57.446, Speaker D: To go and I didn't think it was gonna work out I didn't know.
00:05:57.510 - 00:05:59.766, Speaker B: I was about to find out through.
00:05:59.830 - 00:06:39.034, Speaker D: The mistakes or the bad days and make it through felt like a liar put on her face but I was just getting by and somehow it came back to when I was young I can't believe how far I've come how far I've come how far I've come oh, how far you've come.
00:06:44.254 - 00:06:44.934, Speaker B: No I.
00:06:44.974 - 00:07:24.914, Speaker D: Didn'T think it was gonna work out I didn't think it was gonna work out felt like a fake felt like a liar put on the face but I was just getting by? Somehow it came back to when I was young somehow looking back to when I was young I can't believe how far I've come how far I've come.

00:09:42.854 - 00:11:23.274, Speaker B: Walking by the riverside? As the sky's open wide? I'm glowing on the inside? Cause I? I don't mind the rain? Pouring down, pouring down? I don't mind the rain? It don't get me down? It don't get me down? I don't mind the rain and the cloud? The cold and the gray and the blue? I don't mind the rain? When it makes me think of you? I don't mind the rain? The waves fooling on my skin? Reminding me of where I've been? Little memory sinking in like home? I don't mind the rain? Pour it down? Pouring down? I don't mind the rain? It don't get me down? It don't get me down? I don't mind the rain? And the cold and the gray and the blue? I don't mind the rain? When it makes me think of you? Light on the rain? Pouring down? Pouring down? Pouring down?
