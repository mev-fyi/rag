00:00:20.280 - 00:00:21.020, Speaker A: One sec.
00:00:32.634 - 00:01:18.014, Speaker B: Okay, I think we're live. Hey, everyone, I'm Maddie from the Solana Labs team, and welcome to our most recent session for the Ignition hackathon. And today I have Alpha Ray, the founder of Radium protocol Xerox, Maki from Sushiswap, and Ian from Sabre. And today we're going to be discussing all things decentralized exchange. First of all, thanks, guys, for joining, and maybe it'd be best to just give a quick intro a little bit about each of your projects, and then we can jump in from there. Alfred, you want to start?
00:01:20.414 - 00:02:14.254, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So, yes, I founded Radium, which is basically a hybrid amm built on top of Solana. So what makes us a bit different from traditionally mms is that we've incorporated serum's central limit order book. So not only do we do an amm or a normal swap on our page, but we also are market makers on serum and provide equilibrium for the whole ecosystem. So basically, anybody interacting with radium is interacting with not just radium, but serum. And when they provide liquidity here, we also clear it out as limit orders on the order book. And users are able to either swap against our tools or swap games to order books, depending on which one gives them the better price.
00:02:14.254 - 00:02:26.974, Speaker A: So, on top of the AMM, we also have a launch pad for new projects, and we've recently introduced an NFT drop zone to help new projects get off the ground with their nfts.
00:02:29.754 - 00:02:32.334, Speaker B: Thanks, Ian. Do you want to go next?
00:02:33.474 - 00:02:56.364, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So I'm working on Sabre, which is a exchange for stable swaps on Solana. So, basically, if there's two assets that are supposed to have the same price or try to stay around the same price as each other, the saber algorithms basically optimize towards that. And Sabre is largely based off of the math of curve, so you can think of it as curve and Solana.
00:02:57.944 - 00:02:58.664, Speaker D: Nice.
00:02:58.824 - 00:03:00.764, Speaker B: And then finally, maki.
00:03:02.624 - 00:03:31.384, Speaker E: Hey, Zoe. Maki. I'm the co founder of Sushiswap and currently advising there. It is, a community run amm, which is heavily inspired, aka Fork, of Uniswap V two. We're also doing things with Miso, which is their own launch pattern on Ethereum, and we also have pretty much our own israelite lending, which is called cache. We're currently deployed on over ten chains, and that is pretty much it for us.
00:03:32.324 - 00:03:33.064, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:03:34.534 - 00:04:13.884, Speaker B: And you may notice that I'm the only one that has my video on. I think Ian is using his real identity with his project. But Xerox, Maki and Alpha ray, are not. And so before we dig into the nitty gritty of decentralized exchange and your projects, I'd love to just start out with maybe a little bit of a conversation around why you guys decided to be anon when you started your project. And, like, what the. What the pros and cons are of choosing that route versus using your real identity. So I don't know who wants to start, but I think that's a really interesting topic.
00:04:18.664 - 00:04:45.674, Speaker A: Sure. So I'll start again. Basically, we have. Well, we live in a. It's a tricky thing whether or not to be anon versus using your whole profile. Business development definitely gets a lot easier if you can go out to meet people or if you can have a name online. But it also.
00:04:45.674 - 00:05:22.246, Speaker A: Life also gets a lot trickier when everybody knows who you are. Even within my close friend circle, only a few people know what I do. And I find that it's a little bit easier on life this way, that you don't have people bugging you all the time for random things, and that the point of this is not to be a celebrity. Right. It's to really bring Defi to the world. And just like Satoshi Nakamoto, it's. It leaves a little bit.
00:05:22.246 - 00:05:39.134, Speaker A: Makes the community feel a little bit more. It feels a little different when everybody doesn't do it for their fame and people don't really know your name. You can just be another member of the community when you're chatting with other people like that.
00:05:43.634 - 00:06:20.518, Speaker E: Yeah, I call a lot with Ray. I think, you know, it's mostly about being judged by or action or conviction or contribution, rather than by who I am, by my background, my peer. It's all about, like, just contributing freely. And that doesn't require a name and shouldn't be. Doesn't require a status, doesn't require anything, should just be about, like, who you are as a person is probably the first form that you can have being an anon. So that's kind of the optic here. And, you know, like, the way some, you know, jurisdiction are not as friendly as some others, etcetera.
00:06:20.518 - 00:06:51.854, Speaker E: I think ultimately, an Adam is just, like, giving himself way more trouble on the upset level, on, you know, like, the trust level for, like, other community members, et cetera. Like, it's always kind of making things harder, and you need to have system in place to make sure these individuals are not, like, becoming bad actor or going rogue. So that to me, is, you know, just like, ardens the whole process and kind of decentralization. So it's pretty dope.
00:06:53.394 - 00:07:02.762, Speaker B: Makes sense. Ian, did you ever consider when building in crypto going anon? Okay, now you joined the videos.
00:07:02.818 - 00:07:03.226, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:03.250 - 00:07:04.474, Speaker B: I mean, curious to hear your thoughts.
00:07:04.514 - 00:07:05.534, Speaker A: Let's do it.
00:07:06.274 - 00:07:45.574, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that, I mean, I've definitely considered it in the past, and, I mean, I've been more, I guess, low key before, I guess my first public project, which was Ubiswap, and yeah, I think it's really good, especially if you're learning and you might like, I guess, make some mistakes to just be a non, just be another community member that just contributes to things. But yeah, there's also, like, a benefit to using your real name too, in that I actually have, like, I can go to events, like, talk to people about Solana, but there's definitely a lot of value in being a non as well.
00:07:46.594 - 00:07:47.414, Speaker D: Yep.
00:07:49.194 - 00:08:23.384, Speaker B: So, yeah, maybe. Maybe to discuss some, you know, more. More details about kind of the decisions you guys made. All of you guys have built kind of like components of an automated market maker into your project. And I'm curious, kind of like from a high level, why did you choose an amm model versus an order book? And if you could do it again, would you make the same decision? So maybe, actually, Ian, maybe you can start and then we can work around the room.
00:08:24.284 - 00:08:24.644, Speaker D: Sure.
00:08:24.684 - 00:08:24.948, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:08:24.996 - 00:09:09.274, Speaker C: So. So sabre is targeting a stable pair. So, like, basically, like the, I guess, disadventure of using an amm, usually, especially like, volatile assets is implemented loss, where the amm might make some trades that are not optimal for what you want to do. So, like, if you're just like a bag holder, like, you're just going to lose money if you're in the AMm and you have to, like, subsidize it with other things. But if you have stable pairs, then the amm is, or the pair is always supposed to converge back to the same value. So first of all, it's not as interesting to trade from a non amen perspective because it's less volatile. So you're not going to be able to make as much money from market making.
00:09:09.274 - 00:09:37.674, Speaker C: And second, since you have the LP token, you could use that for other purposes, you could use this collateral, and it's basically the same thing as the underlying asset. For example, if you use USDC, USDT, LP, so they're both worth $1, right? You're not going to make much money on that if you're just market making on Kucoin when it goes above a dollar, below a dollar. But if you have this LP token, then you're making those fees from market making like you normally would do. But on top of that, you have this dollar you can use in other places.
00:09:42.494 - 00:09:42.806, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:09:42.830 - 00:09:43.514, Speaker C: Does it.
00:09:44.554 - 00:09:46.010, Speaker D: Does that answer your question? Cool.
00:09:46.162 - 00:10:16.906, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Maki and I think that makes a lot of sense given, like, you guys are doing extremely, highly, highly correlated pairs, whether it's like USDT for USDC or like, you know, some derivative or synthetic version of bitcoin for another derivative or synthetic of bitcoin. So it makes sense in that sense for those pairs. But how about, like, going outside of, like, stable swaps, like, where there's this kind of notion of impermanent loss? I'm curious, like, Maki and Alfa Ray, what are your thoughts there?
00:10:17.010 - 00:11:01.344, Speaker E: Yeah, for us. For me personally, what do I really like about the AMM design for kind of uncredited asset is that initially kickstarting the pool and the assets? Making assets liquid initially is extremely easy. You just put up two assets together, you decide of the weight, you decide of the price, and there you go. You have a market that is basically running and people can start to buy in, can start to add liquidity over and over, et cetera. Ultimately, when, you know, like, the market is becoming, I guess, more mature, there's like a question to be asked whether or not, like, this makes sense. And I think it's highly relevant. And, you know, like, many people are claiming that for price discovery, like order book at a certain point is way better.
00:11:01.344 - 00:11:54.640, Speaker E: But there's also, like a small detail on Ethereum or constraint that, you know, very like, that is not, I guess, something that people in Solana think for that was the gas price back then. Amm was basically the most efficient way to kind of trade for people that were using like, Ethereum wallet and et cetera. If you abstract this gas component, then things are quite different. And we can see it with one of the most, I think, flagrant design example is DydX. The moment they switch to L2, they saw their volume, like, skyrocket. And I think this is just a statement on how much friction there is with kind of these transaction costs. So amm, like, for low cost of transaction and kind of bootstrapping, liquidity and so on is perfect.
00:11:54.640 - 00:12:34.654, Speaker E: I do think that the whole advent of liquidity mining was also, like, very key in making kind of these LP pool and amm way more popular than they were before. So there's this component that basically, like money Legos were built on top which can be replicated, I think, with, you know, regular order book style. But it's not wouldn't be the same way. So, yeah, just like the passive. The passive of Amm is, to me, like, super easy to comprehend for many people, even though there's some risk of infinite loss.
00:12:36.234 - 00:12:37.054, Speaker D: Yep.
00:12:37.434 - 00:12:52.294, Speaker B: And then Alpha ray, as far as I understand, radium is kind of almost a hybrid model of an amm. Plus, you plug into serum, which is an on chain order book. Can you kind of explain what the design decision was there?
00:12:53.824 - 00:12:54.648, Speaker D: Yep.
00:12:54.816 - 00:14:11.894, Speaker A: So, first of all, amm is elegant. The equation is straightforward, it's easy to understand, and it also provides liquidity for price, like any token that goes to any price. And it also fits in perfectly well within orderbook in that it's two assets that you're trading against. So take Sol and Ray, for example. The reason we went with it at the beginning was also because Solana was in its early days and there was a need for something like this in the ecosystem, basically something that would, all these new projects come in and they needed liquidity, and there was, well, the main exchange would be serum. But there is, there are very few market makers in the space for serum, and that we decided to add the order book as a component because there were a lot of users on serum as well, and there's a lot of projects that want to launch on it. So we are able to provide a service that other projects really do need and that users can also enjoy by having better liquidity on top of the platform.
00:14:13.874 - 00:15:06.794, Speaker B: Got it. And, yeah, I know one thing that both, I think, sushi and radium have kind of been known for is going beyond just providing an amm for simple swaps. There's a lot of products that you guys kind of offer on the platforms. Can you kind of talk through from, like, a product development standpoint? How do you decide, for instance, for radium to go into this kind of, like, ido platform? Why did you go there first? And then, I know for Maki, I know a lot of the product decisions were kind of expanding beyond just a simple swap. So maybe just kind of go into how you guys think about building out these other features.
00:15:07.614 - 00:15:39.244, Speaker E: Maybe I can start on this one because I think it's a very compelling thing. I didn't personally envision anyway in any single way, like the way we would have built product. It really came down to community. Like, they just literally, like some devs were interested in building with us. They show up, they just pitch us. They pitch the community on the forum, they just say, hey, I want to build this decentralized NFT marketplace. And literally applying with a grant and, you know, we just fund it as a.
00:15:39.244 - 00:15:56.124, Speaker E: As a community. We say, yes, this is a good idea, we want to support this. And kind of goes on. Same for cash, like the isolated money market. It was like a hundred K sushi grant. It's kind of. It is messy, but at the same time it kind of works.
00:15:56.124 - 00:16:29.716, Speaker E: We put kind of a lot of, I guess, responsibility on them. On this contributor. There's a lot of trust. And usually these people are very passionate about kind of sushi, the community, the project, and they just go to the finish line in some instance. You know, it didn't happen because of, you know, like technical bottleneck and so on. But rule of thumbs is usually like any of the product that you see that is being built for sushi is just like someone that got their hand dirty and wanted to contribute. That's pretty much it.
00:16:29.716 - 00:17:02.074, Speaker E: Like on the dev team, like the core team, there's been like many massive improvement in the UI, the UX, and, you know, like right now we have like Trident, which is about to come live on Ethereum, and it's going to be deployed on multichain afterwards, which is kind of a three in one emm. But, you know, like, on the technical aspect, on the product, it's not just like a single kind of person taking decision. It's more like a group of people coming together. And that is the community led aspect of sushi.
00:17:06.454 - 00:17:39.004, Speaker B: Got it. Yeah, that's really interesting. It's more just like the community putting up things that they want to see build or have the capacity to build themselves. And you guys just kind of using this DaO structure of adopting those technologies into the platform. As far as I understand, alpha ray, like radium, doesn't have quite the same kind of, like, dao like structure that sushi does. So how do you as a core team for radium, like, kind of decide what features to add or not without this kind of, like, community input?
00:17:41.424 - 00:17:56.108, Speaker A: So we do have a pretty big community on Discord and telegram. We haven't been able to fully implement the Dell features yet. We've been. Well, Salada's ecosystem is much younger.
00:17:56.156 - 00:17:56.796, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:56.980 - 00:19:24.096, Speaker A: And we basically identified the needs of our community and the ecosystem as they were coming up. So when we first started, there were very few projects on Solana, and there were no launch pads here. So to really grow the entire ecosystem and grow the community, we needed more projects to launch, and we need a lot of basic infrastructure on Solana. So since we'd already launched there and we've gone through a lot of it, we looked at the needs that we had before when launching and we built the accelerator, basically, it really is an accelerator in that we talked to projects from very early on in their building, and we do advisory, we give them, we help them with tokenomics, we help them get connected with the right people and beat the rest of the community. We also do a lot of marketing with them and we help them get launched and we also help them build liquidity so that their projects are tradable for users and that they also have the funding to continue building healthy. So yeah, the launchpad was really hard. Accelerator was really built around that there was a need for this to continue growing.
00:19:24.096 - 00:19:59.674, Speaker A: The ecosystem and the community really enjoyed doing launchpads as well. And the same with the NFT drop zone. So drop zone was built because we were trying to, a lot of us were in our users. We're trying to get into these NFT drops on Solana and these NFT drops. A lot of them wouldn't go very smoothly. There was the first come, first serve and a billion people trying to get out at the same time. So a lot of them didn't have the necessary infrastructure to support a drop of this size.
00:19:59.674 - 00:20:29.034, Speaker A: But since we'd already done this for a while and we had a lot of stuff ready for it, we decided to hop in this and just help out the ecosystem as a whole, because, well, going through these pains ourselves, it's not pleasant and it's also not a great look. So we, yeah, we basically just look around and see where we can help out, how we can really grow the ecosystem so that we can all do well in it.
00:20:30.854 - 00:20:31.634, Speaker D: Cool.
00:20:32.034 - 00:21:31.424, Speaker B: And one interesting thing that you guys have mentioned a little bit is kind of the role of the token in your platforms, as well as sort of like an incentive or yield farming promotion. I'd love to get your guys thoughts on when, when. From like a product standpoint, do you get, and just community standpoint, do you decide to introduce a token? Um, I think all of you have all three projects that you guys represent kind of did it at different stages. So would love to kind of hear about your thought process on, you know, when to introduce a token. Is it, you know, do you want to make sure your product is like sticky enough, um, from a UX perspective that, that you feel comfortable, like, adding on these incentives. Like, when do you make that decision? Maybe ian, you can start.
00:21:32.684 - 00:22:29.226, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think that the token is what actually brings the users to the platform in the first place. And, uh, I mean, if you're, if you're building something that has a very, like a well known analog on a different chain that, um, a lot of people are already using that has, you know, token incentives, then I feel like it makes a lot of sense to just add the token incentives in. Um, if you're just like making some like more experimental project where you don't really know if people actually want it, then, uh, it might not make sense to add token incentives, but that token incentives will just like inflate all of your growth metrics, uh, whenever you add them in. So, um, like the thing, it could, even if the project might not be useful, like the project would be useful when the token centers are launched. Um, and like, like, basically, like, um, I think it's good to launch the tokens. Um, I if you want your project to, uh, grow. Sorry.
00:22:29.226 - 00:22:38.334, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a little convoluted, but, um, yeah, they should. Yeah, I think tokens are good to launch earlier rather than later.
00:22:40.034 - 00:22:40.386, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:40.410 - 00:22:57.074, Speaker B: And I think obviously ccswap, famous vampire attack on uniswap, is an example of this. So maki, would love to hear your thoughts on when to introduce a token into your project.
00:22:58.534 - 00:24:03.124, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, for us it was not really out of boosting some metrics or else. I think it was more about the frustration and the fact that there was absolutely no way to help out or you know, contribute and be kind of received back then. I don't think this is now the case for insof. I think they kind of awakened because of kind of everything that happened, they released it token, even though like the governance per se aspect is, you know, there's like degrees of success and you know, I'm personally like, not gonna critique everyone as long as, you know, like this is on chain and everything. I think they've been good. Well, I guess in this sense, but you know, like the regarding like kind of distribution and everything, for us, it's been kind of clear from day one that this token was kind of not for, for our team, not for our kind of our interest, you know, like the team, the core team at sushi on like 0.8% of the token, which is like, you know, almost nothing if you ask me.
00:24:03.124 - 00:25:10.750, Speaker E: And is that a bad thing or a good thing? I think the fact that most of the distribution is handled by, you know, LP's community members and people that basically have skin in the game is extremely good. And they can be like kind of responsible of like dictating what they want from this protocol, whether they want like change on pretty much anything, to be honest. Like whether this is team member whether this is like more incentives, whether it's granted, et cetera. There's like really good value to adding a token, I think, to any kind of DAos communities and so on, just so create this like kind of coordination mechanism. And of course you can even attract like liquidity money. And at this point this really creates, not a mode per se, but it creates more stickiness or like value revenues. There's like this very, this very slippery slope though, where, you know, if you incentivize too much and the inflation is not controlled in a way that is same, you will fall into a debt loop.
00:25:10.750 - 00:25:45.598, Speaker E: And that's what we've seen with. We remember, what's the name of it? Sorry. There was this curve fork on Ethereum that I can't remember. Swerve, swerve. There you go. So there was swerve on Ethereum and they kind of fell into this dead loop where incentives are so low that LP's just move away or go somewhere else. And then that's where you witness kind of the death of some of these, I guess, over incentivized protocols and sometimes can be very hurtful for sushi.
00:25:45.598 - 00:26:32.486, Speaker E: Right now we're working with gauntlet network to mitigate kind of these issues and we're making sure that pairs that are incentivized are usually in the net positive for sushi, or if not like very small margin. Margin. So that is kind of how we've been able to kind of sustain this, you know, this rhythm. There's also like, of course, the aspect of doing like vesting to it, etcetera, overall, like a token just to boost kind of metrics can be very dangerous in my opinion, if there is no actual value to it. We'll see what happens with, for example, I don't know, that's the last test I've seen. But DyDX, apparently there's absolutely no revenue shares or anything. All of the revenues goes to the Inc.
00:26:32.486 - 00:27:38.774, Speaker E: So what does it say to kind of the communities and holders? I don't know, but so far it's been going pretty well, so it doesn't really matter. Sometimes it's a all about kind of the narrative we'll see in the end, like kind of where this all goes. But incentives and token usually are pretty good if you want to attract LP. We'll see if in the long run, like we can find ways to transform, I guess, mercenaries into long term oriented people, holders and so on. I think what VCurve is doing is pretty interesting. There's a bunch of others like Edzil from pickle convex sushi is potentially going to launch o sushi, which should in theory goes in the same kind of vein. But everything takes time and you cannot just throw around new tokenomics here and there and try to basically change a system with multiple billion dollar in TVL.
00:27:38.774 - 00:27:42.834, Speaker E: So that's kind of my optic, I guess, for everything related to token vampire attacks.
00:27:47.094 - 00:27:47.734, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:27:47.854 - 00:28:42.024, Speaker B: Cool. One other additional question I actually had for you specifically. Maki was around like, you know, I feel like of between, you know, radium saber and sushi swap. I'd say sushi is kind of been around the longest and has probably like the largest, largest community, and you've completely kind of like decentralized it to this dao structure. How do you envision maintaining that kind of continuity and usage of the token in governance decisions when sushi is kind of like entering this multi chain world where there's outposts of the sushi protocol in a variety of different chains outside of Ethereum, how do you see that cross chain governance working out long term?
00:28:44.804 - 00:29:55.224, Speaker E: I don't know if I can leak alpha or not, but basically there is protocols working on doing cross chain calls of smart contract you can think of connects. There's a bunch of others, we're in active talks with them where you could potentially, in theory, you know, based on your old things, your XT URL's that is on another chain that is, or sitting in Ethereum, you could ping them from a layer that is like way cheaper from, say, solana or say, polygon, say avalanche, et cetera, you could in theory, be doing this type of actions. And right now, sushi itself is not even fully decentralized, in my opinion, where we need to have on chain governance with, you know, payload of codes, et cetera, similar to compound aave and so on. So when this comes down to, I guess, like the really nitty gritty and so on, Osushi is just a step in this direction. And then, you know, like, there's going to be an even more powerful kind of migration for the entire system, in my opinion, at some point we're seeing it with Bento, too. It's probably going to get fully endover to the community right now. There's still like a multi sig on it.
00:29:55.224 - 00:30:36.984, Speaker E: Um, overall, like, all these challenges is kind of what I think most people should be focused on, uh, rather than, you know, um, for us, you know, in this case, sometimes we just don't have any. We don't know where like the, I guess the subjects and teams are kind of working on. So, for example, show you, um, is going to be launching like in a week or two. And they were initially going with Polygon, but maybe they're also going to be using some other layers for the main thing and so on. So all of this is kind of really messy to organize. And, you know, we have like, I think only like 01:00 p.m. Right now.
00:30:36.984 - 00:31:34.756, Speaker E: So that just gives you an idea of, you know, managing all of this 25 remote decentralized team is pretty difficult. So, yeah, that's all it came down to in my opinion. Like, decentralization is art. And I don't know if personally, like, when I look back at everything that we've done over the year, when Naomi asked me if the community is ready for governance, I was wondering if I was saying yes, of course, the first minute, but now I realize potentially, like, we should have hold back a little bit more. So, you know, for cross chain governance, it's just going to come down to leveraging kind of, you know, cross, cross train calls, etcetera, I think personally. But who knows, maybe some other people are going to have some other ideas. Aave is moving in the same kind of direction.
00:31:34.756 - 00:31:40.944, Speaker E: So that should, in theory, be a good indication that, you know, we're also on the right path.
00:31:43.004 - 00:31:43.784, Speaker D: Yep.
00:31:44.404 - 00:31:45.184, Speaker A: Cool.
00:31:47.364 - 00:32:41.254, Speaker B: And then one of my last questions for you guys is kind of around, you know, you guys have all had a lot of success in terms of like, you know, daily trading volume or value locked in your guys protocols. And, you know, I'm wondering from your perspective, like, what is it going to take to get decentralized exchange to the next level, which is starting to eat most centralized crypto exchange markets and beyond? I know there have been days, I think DyDx surpassed the Coinbase's volume 24 hours volume recently. How is this going to with your respective projects? How do you guys envision unlocking the next stage of growth? So maybe, Alfa Rae, you can go first.
00:32:45.594 - 00:33:37.758, Speaker A: So, first of all, offering the same tier of features and services that first centralized exchanges provide. Basically that centralized exchanges still have a large advantage and that they can do process fiat. Their UX is arguably better or easier to use, at least in the fact that you don't need to approve transactions with your tokens on chain. And there's just a large barrier of entry for new users on decentralized exchanges. So making those barriers of entries smaller and making everything a little bit more user friendly for the common people who have not had a chance to experience this yet.
00:33:37.806 - 00:33:38.446, Speaker D: Right.
00:33:38.630 - 00:34:23.714, Speaker A: And so UX is a huge part of it. And then afterwards, it is that users really need to. Well, education. They need to understand and to learn what the advantages of a decentralized exchange are, and that they have more safety over their tokens and that they have complete control over their wallets. So it takes. It'll take a lot of education, it'll take some time, and that it will also, we need to make improvements basically everywhere to give users a better product. Right.
00:34:23.714 - 00:34:34.274, Speaker A: Because in the end, we are, or what? Radium is still a product to a user, and the best product usually ends up winning in the end.
00:34:38.654 - 00:34:39.914, Speaker B: Ian, what do you think?
00:34:40.894 - 00:35:23.214, Speaker C: Yeah, I have several perspectives on this. So, I mean, in terms of saber, I think the main thing is to get these lp tokens to be used as collateral, because they're basically the same things as using the underlying tokens as collateral, except youll have the risk of two tokens instead of one, which most people are fine having both USDC and USDT as collateral, equivalently. So thats for saber. Now, in terms of just the Dex space in general, I think the main thing would probably be cross margin. I think it needs to be really easy for people to take on lots of leverage and trade, very large size. So I think liquidity also needs to be really good for that. And they should be able to get out of their positions quickly too, and on the go, like wherever they are.
00:35:23.214 - 00:36:23.124, Speaker C: I think it's really important. I also think that just the general UX of a lot of apps can be improved. I think that we're still getting a lot of random Solana errors in most apps where you just see this error processing instruction stuff, but that stuff doesn't exist in binance. We just want to make sure that it's very easy for people to use things, and I don't think it's necessarily an education thing. I think that you could actually just make an experience that's exactly like finance, and then that experience would be usable by a lot of people. The fiat on ramp thing is not an issue to a lot of people, I think because a lot of people I know that use binance, they actually get their fiat from somewhere else, and then they put onto binance, they're not actually using the Binance fiat gateways, they use binance because it has all these other features. So, yeah, I definitely agree that.
00:36:24.824 - 00:36:25.184, Speaker D: We.
00:36:25.224 - 00:36:31.244, Speaker C: Just have to improve on a lot of things within DeFi to get to that level, but I think it can happen very fast.
00:36:34.264 - 00:36:35.044, Speaker D: Cool.
00:36:37.024 - 00:37:15.654, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think we have five more minutes before the session ends. Just want to go around the room here, give you guys a chance to give some advice to some of the participants in the hackathon. So this whole video series is kind of being as part of our ignition hackathon, which is running right now. There's about ten days left. So I think Ian, actually, project Sabre was a winner in the first Solana hackathon. So we'd love for you guys to give some advice to hackers right now so you can go first, Ian.
00:37:16.074 - 00:37:32.298, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think it wasn't as competitive back then. There just weren't as many people building in Solana. But I think the most important thing is to ship a product that works and is polished. Like, it should be something that you're willing to. Like, maybe it's not secure yet because it's a hackathon. Right.
00:37:32.298 - 00:37:54.304, Speaker C: But it should be something that has good ux that you're willing to actually use yourself. Like, it should be a product that you're building for, like, a specific person that you know is going to use it. Um, yeah, so, like, with, with us stable swap, right. We we just focus on making it feel like, just, like, curve. We we wanted to make it feel like it just a faster curve. And, uh, yeah, just. Just make sure you ship a good product out.
00:37:59.924 - 00:38:01.384, Speaker B: Maki, you want to go next?
00:38:03.564 - 00:38:51.042, Speaker E: I think, uh, overall, uh, yeah, and pretty much said it, like, just ship something that works and refine. Just need to, with the eyes. Like, we don't care if, you know, like, the back end is not, like, the most optimized or, you know, killer, etcetera, as long as the basic functionality are there and people can use it. You know, right now in Solana, there is not, like, a plethora of tabs that, you know, people can just go and use easily. So I think that is the most important, critical things for everyone. And, yeah, I think, no, I don't really have, like, other advices aside that, you know, Solana is a line of opportunity, in my opinion. Like, there is, like, everything to be built, literally, so you shouldn't have too much of a hard time.
00:38:51.042 - 00:38:52.014, Speaker E: My opinion.
00:38:53.554 - 00:38:55.974, Speaker B: Great. Alfare.
00:39:00.094 - 00:39:23.074, Speaker A: It's really. Yeah, build products that you see a need for, build it quickly and make sure those work, and that it is easy to use. Just as the other two have said, it's really what it comes down to. Right. That people feel like they can easily use your product and that they need your product in the first place.
00:39:25.274 - 00:39:34.094, Speaker B: Awesome. Easy to use. People want it, go build it. So. Sounds great, guys. Thanks. Thanks for joining me tonight.
00:39:34.094 - 00:39:40.014, Speaker B: And, yeah, that's all we have for this evening, so thanks again.
00:39:41.154 - 00:39:42.122, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, guys.
00:39:42.178 - 00:39:43.594, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye.
