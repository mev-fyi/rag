00:00:00.720 - 00:00:01.646, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other.
00:00:01.670 - 00:00:06.534, Speaker B: We'Re not gonna make it. Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew.
00:00:06.654 - 00:00:07.758, Speaker A: Most of the time, I work in.
00:00:07.766 - 00:00:12.982, Speaker B: A glass jar and lead a very uneventful life. A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it.
00:00:13.038 - 00:00:14.878, Speaker A: That's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
00:00:14.926 - 00:00:15.518, Speaker B: Eating glass.
00:00:15.566 - 00:00:18.234, Speaker A: Eating glass is staring at the abyss. Glass.
00:00:18.814 - 00:00:21.674, Speaker B: Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this?
00:00:23.054 - 00:00:29.514, Speaker A: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass. Better get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:38.454 - 00:01:01.478, Speaker B: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing Glass, the show where we talk to developers building in the Solana ecosystem. Today I'm joined by Carlos, member of super team Germany, a recent placer in the hyperdrive hackathon with his finance product juicer. He also placed in previous hackathons as well. We'll talk about that in a little bit, but let's get this started. How's it going, Carlos?
00:01:01.606 - 00:01:04.342, Speaker A: Hey, jace. Awesome to be here. Big fan of the show.
00:01:04.438 - 00:01:32.728, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. To be honest, we were looking for another guest because we had a cancellation, and I reached out to Matty Taylor, who, you know, who is a big part of our global hackathons. And I was like, hey, who's pretty good at speaking and not super awkward, that's also a developer. And he was like, um, I think Carlos could be good. Uh, not. Nothing against the other participants, uh, but, um. But.
00:01:32.728 - 00:01:51.284, Speaker B: But he did recommend that I speak with you. Um, and, like, I've seen you around for quite a while. We've never actually officially met. We've engaged on Twitter a little bit. But, um, so great to have you on the show. Would love to. To kick things off by just sort of talking about, sort of the story of Carlos.
00:01:51.284 - 00:02:06.634, Speaker B: And let's start from the beginning, like, you're building on Solana now, but, like, where did that. Where did that trajectory all begin? Like, were you. Did you study cs in school? Are you self taught? Like, how'd you get started in software?
00:02:07.294 - 00:02:44.958, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's kind of, like, a really interesting story. I did not study anything technical in school. I basically did it. I stalled on going on to university until I realized that I wanted to do filmmaking and photography. So I went to school eventually to do documentary photography and photojournalism, and that sort of, like, took me all over the place, and I basically landed in Berlin, where I kind of, like, tried to figure out, sort of, like, how the working situation would be with German. I'm not german.
00:02:44.958 - 00:02:46.063, Speaker A: I don't speak Germany.
00:02:46.063 - 00:02:47.284, Speaker B: Where are you from short?
00:02:47.324 - 00:02:49.028, Speaker A: To learn German? I'm colombian.
00:02:49.116 - 00:02:50.620, Speaker B: Colombian? Oh, cool.
00:02:50.812 - 00:03:26.074, Speaker A: Yeah. And so here in Germany, I basically ended up working a lot in corporate stuff and then eventually took a job in the marketing department of a wine company, like an online wine company, when the pandemic hit. And there's only, like, five ways that you can take pictures of wine bottles, to be honest. And so I kind of, like, really fell out of love with the form and sort of, like.
00:03:26.194 - 00:03:28.854, Speaker B: But not fell out. You didn't fall out of love with wine, though.
00:03:29.714 - 00:03:55.748, Speaker A: No, no. That only grew. Yeah. And I kind of, like, burnt out. And so I was, like, I was thinking of different things to do. The pandemic was in full swing, so I knew that I wouldn't be able to get a new job as a photographer. And so I basically started to like, okay, let me try to make my work life a little bit better, easier.
00:03:55.748 - 00:04:54.864, Speaker A: And so I got really into, like, notion and, like, all these little no code tools, like zapier and stuff. And eventually, like, one of my jobs was, like, to take all the information of a wine and then put it in this nicely presented card with the picture of the wine that I just took. Right. But it would take me a long time every week to do this menial task. And so it was driving me crazy. And I basically, I figured out that I could basically hack something together using Google scripts and, like, some YouTube videos of, like, how to sort of, like, put the image automatically from a database, like, from Google sheets into the. This format that I need to be and then export it to PDF.
00:04:54.864 - 00:05:44.094, Speaker A: And. And that was the first time that I ever touched any code. I had no coding abilities before that and no math abilities before that, for all that matter. And it was quite mind blowing to me that something so simple of following 90% of a tutorial and a bunch of googling could save me hours every week. And I got hooked. I got absolutely hooked. And that turned into me quitting my job and then taking a job at a coffee shop so I could have enough time to teach myself how to code at home in my off time.
00:05:44.094 - 00:05:47.430, Speaker A: That's basically kind of what got me started to learn how to code.
00:05:47.502 - 00:06:33.424, Speaker B: We just had flux beam on here recently and same, same sort of, like, obviously not the exact same story, but just totally self taught. Some crazy reason. We see a lot of self taught engineers becoming highly successful in web3. And this is really, like, sort of cool stuff to hear also, by the way, like, Mike, I was a CS major in college, but after about six or seven years. I was working some soul sucking software jobs. I quit for two years to become a professional photographer because I loved it so much. And then it, I lost my passion for it because I had to turn it into money.
00:06:33.424 - 00:06:57.586, Speaker B: And then I went back to software. So anyways, just a little. So I still do it. I still do it on whenever I'm traveling or any sort of, sort of stuff like that. But, like, turning photography to money, to me, sort of ruined the whole experience. So I leave that for my own, like, devices at this point. But anyways, yeah, but anyways, let's.
00:06:57.586 - 00:07:05.034, Speaker B: Let's jump back to it. All right, so you're working at a coffee shop, you're teaching yourself to code. How long did that last? And then, like, where'd you go from there?
00:07:05.194 - 00:07:57.834, Speaker A: Yeah, it, see, the first year was a lot of udemy and, like, YouTube. You know, I kind of, like, I did a week worth of a boot camp and then kind of decided that, like, they were moving too slow because, like, you could learn all of it on YouTube. And I think, like, it came down to, like, if you're motivated enough, you can do it on your own. And so I worked at a couple coffee shops for a bit. I was working only part time, so I really had, like, 40 hours a week, so I could just, like, do it. And it took me maybe better part of a year before I even started to do, like, little projects and start thinking about working with it. Before that, it was very unclear how long it would take me.
00:07:57.834 - 00:08:03.474, Speaker A: And, yeah, right around there is kind of, like, where I found crypto.
00:08:04.094 - 00:08:40.714, Speaker B: Oh, so you, so there is no story of you taking web two jobs in between, like, your introduction to crypto. Oh, so wine to some other random stuff to coffee shop, and then, like, learn how to code and then jump straight into crypto. Okay, so what, like, was there a before Solana, or was it, like, like, in your crypto experience, like, were you, like, were you trading crypto? Were you doing it? Like, were you aware of it, like, any sort of that stuff before, like, before we start into the solana journey?
00:08:42.664 - 00:09:15.454, Speaker A: Not really. I mean, I kind of knew about bitcoin, basically. Like, I've always been very techy. I've always been interested in tech in general. And so I heard about bitcoin, but I think that was, like, back when I was in high school or something. And then eventually while I was working the wine job, somebody there, uh, was day trading crypto. And I was like, what? Like, this is not only for, like, criminals.
00:09:15.454 - 00:09:19.026, Speaker A: Like, I had all these crazy prejudices. Okay.
00:09:19.050 - 00:09:20.214, Speaker B: Elizabeth Warren.
00:09:20.834 - 00:09:46.614, Speaker A: Exactly. And that was the first time that I saw a regular person using crypto. Right. Now that I know many criminals that use crypto either, but, um, yeah, it was quite shocking to me. And then the girlfriend of a friend of mine, one day, we kind of, like, picked her up at some place, and we went on a walk altogether. And she was telling me that she was working at a web3 company. And I was like, whoa, what's that? And she's like, yeah, it has to do with the blockchain.
00:09:46.614 - 00:10:18.184, Speaker A: And I was like, wait, wait, wait. I thought you were an artist. You know? And then, like, she starts telling me about sort of like, how, like, you know, nfts and all this stuff, and I was like, whoa. Like, there's this whole aspect to this that I had absolutely no idea about. And that kind of took me down the rabbit hole of, like, you know, the bitcoin white paper and then Ethereum. And then, like, I remember I. There was this, like, you know, I was a photographer, and I was working at a coffee shop, so I was broke, right? Yeah.
00:10:18.184 - 00:10:37.436, Speaker A: I was a starving artist for most of my life. And when I found Ethereum, I was super excited to try a bunch of things out. And I remember there was, like, a. The sale, the first sale of a fractionalized crypto punk. And I was, like, super stoked. Like, oh, my God, I'm going to be a part of history. Let me buy a share.
00:10:37.436 - 00:11:05.802, Speaker A: Right? And so I spent, like, 40 of my $100 that I had on this share of this. This fractionalized share of this crypto punk. And then we, like, the sort of, like, party kind of won the auction. And then I was like, yeah, this is super cool. Let me claim it. And then to claim it cost, like, three times as much as the share that I bought, and so I never ended up claiming it. And then I was like, wait, wait.
00:11:05.802 - 00:11:19.254, Speaker A: Something's kind of broken here. The system doesn't really work as. As I was promised, basically. And I kind of put it to a side a little bit until eventually I found Solana, and then, you know, the rest is history, basically.
00:11:19.914 - 00:11:36.064, Speaker B: Okay, so now let's start talking about who red pilled you. Did you red pill yourself on Solana? Did somebody find you? Did you come to a hacker house? How did that whole thing get started?
00:11:36.404 - 00:12:01.224, Speaker A: Yeah, I was trying to learn a lot about Defi. I was really interested. So I'm colombian, living in Europe. I don't have a european passport. So being an immigrant from a country like Colombia, makes it really difficult to do very simple things. And. And so I always connected with the idea of being able to take care of my finances without some central authority telling me what I could or couldn't do.
00:12:01.224 - 00:12:27.514, Speaker A: And so I was looking for alternatives to Ethereum and saw on Twitter some ideo of a token, and I was like, okay, this seems like it's a different network. Let me check it out. And then I bought the token, and it 100 x in, like, two days. And it just so happened to be that that token was on Solana. And so immediately I had a budget to, like, play around with everything in Solana, and then I basically never went back.
00:12:28.374 - 00:12:46.550, Speaker B: Okay, so what was the. I know you've done a lot of experiments and built a lot of things, but when you say playing around on Solana, like, what were you actually. Did you start, was it just trading around a little bit, or did you start building? Did you do your photography stuff first? Like, how did that. How'd that go?
00:12:46.742 - 00:13:05.868, Speaker A: Yeah, like, it's funny because I. At that point, I had. I still was not convinced that crypto was a serious industry. Like, it was half, like, people selling rocks on the Internet, and then the other half people getting scammed out of their life savings. Or at least that's how it felt.
00:13:05.956 - 00:13:11.424, Speaker B: I mean, it's. It's. It's. I mean, it's partially true and still true today, and many aspects.
00:13:12.084 - 00:13:38.320, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Right? And so I decided that I wanted to get experience at a web two company. And so that's kind of what I was working towards when I was coding. I never really considered working in crypto. And then so a buddy of mine, we were working at the coffee shop together, and I got him interested in coding. I was like, dude, you have to learn how to code. This is super cool.
00:13:38.320 - 00:14:21.684, Speaker A: He was studying mechanical engineering, and we were working our shifts in the coffee shop and talking about jpegs because we were buying stuff on Solana. I kind of red build him, and then one day, out of the blue, he's like, oh, yeah. So I've been teaching myself python, and I built this little discord notification bot for this NfT community that I got rugged in. And we're like, we're restarting this project, and I built this little tool for them in Python, and I was like, mind blown. I was like, whoa. Like, dude, three months ago, you had no idea what code was, and now you're building things on the blockchain. And I was like, I was really stoked.
00:14:21.684 - 00:14:49.168, Speaker A: And so he told me, basically, yeah. And then they told me that I should make it into a product, but I have no idea what I'm doing. And so I was like, wait, wait, wait, let me join, let me help, let me, yeah, let's do this as a thing, right? And so we productize it and like, it took us maybe, I don't know, four or five days. And up to this point, I hadn't done anything really serious.
00:14:49.256 - 00:14:52.312, Speaker B: When was this? When was this, though? It's like time.
00:14:52.368 - 00:14:59.904, Speaker A: So this would have been 2020, around December 2021.
00:14:59.984 - 00:15:02.144, Speaker B: Oh, okay. So that was quite a while ago.
00:15:02.304 - 00:15:39.656, Speaker A: And by then I had been coding for about a year. I still barely knew anything, but I was going through the Javascripts. I started with front end because I tried to learn c, but for somebody who had never seen any code or math in their life, c is really tough. I went back and learned HTML and CSS and then got into JavaScript react and then backend and stuff. We built a little front end for people to purchase these bots. We called it boon bots. And then, so that was December.
00:15:39.656 - 00:16:13.604, Speaker A: And then like the first days of January, we started dming people on discord. Like, hey, like, we built this, this discord bot to keep track of your NFT sales a little bit, like what Matrika was doing. And back then, like, I think I remember grape also did a hackathon. They want a hackathon with a tool like that. But they had this huge backlog of teams that wanted to integrate. And so there was this gap in the market that we saw. And we just started dming all the projects that had just launched the day before, basically.
00:16:13.604 - 00:16:42.324, Speaker A: And they were all trying to get the first bits of utility per se. And so that's kind of like where we pounced. And then we'd be like, yeah, it costs like $300 for a year, and we would be deploying all this in like free MongoDB instances, free heroku instances. Like, it cost us nothing. And we were just doing this for fun. And then they were like, oh, yeah, sure, here's the USDC, run it for me for a year. And we're like, holy shit, we made money on the Internet.
00:16:42.324 - 00:17:10.894, Speaker A: And that was kind of like the tipping point. And I was like, wow, like, actually there's a lot of different things that we could do here. And having somebody to go through the journey with me was kind of like pivotal. And we kind of started scaling that up into baking bots for a bunch of different teams. And then eventually, I don't know if you remember DJ coin flip. It's one of these gambling projects.
00:17:13.034 - 00:17:16.534, Speaker B: As said in the name? Pretty much, yeah, exactly.
00:17:18.074 - 00:17:43.667, Speaker A: And they had this thing on their website where they would display, like, how many flips in a row somebody had won, like these streaks. So I made a Twitter bot that would tweet out whenever somebody had a streak of two flips or more in a row, and then progressively it would put different gifs and messages onto the tweet.
00:17:43.795 - 00:17:51.424, Speaker B: You were basically reading data on chain and then have that connected up to the Twitter API to push that out and. Yeah, yeah, cool, exactly.
00:17:51.464 - 00:18:25.604, Speaker A: And so the entirety of my first sort of, like, first few projects was like just reading data and then displaying it somewhere else. Right. And that got us some marketing from them. And then, like, they really liked the bot, we started working with them. We freelanced with a bunch of different NFT teams, and it started becoming a bit more of an agency of my friend and I building things for different teams. And then I. And then it was, I think it was summer camp.
00:18:25.604 - 00:18:39.984, Speaker A: There was. They did like a built, like, they rented out a space here in Berlin to do a co working space for summer camp. And that was the very first event of crypto that I came to. And that really kind of changed everything.
00:18:40.144 - 00:19:32.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like the Germany sort of build stations have sort of become, like, during our hackathons, it's become really obvious to us that these are some of the most impactful sort of things that we can do. It's like you have a hackathon, but then you have this sort of collaborative space where there's workshops being done. Everybody's building their own project, but they're helping each other along the way. And the results have proven to be, when you look at our hackathon data, when that summer camp hackathon was happening in Germany, did that build station, you saw like, the quality of projects, the number of projects in general just sort of like increase because of that. And like, now the UK has done it. It happened in Singapore, at Bennett camp as well. So these are really impactful events.
00:19:32.512 - 00:19:58.684, Speaker B: Like, a lot of people find their way through, like breakpoint or like hacker houses because those are the sort of like the big, like, exciting ones. But it's cool to hear that you sort of came into a really sort of like developer focused, I feel like, event. And I'm assuming Max from Mango was probably there. And who else do you remember from that first build station?
00:19:59.144 - 00:20:35.758, Speaker A: So it was all the whole ultimate team, ultimate wallet shout out to them. They're like, it's so great to have all these really incredible teams here in Berlin. There was the big brain, had a bit of a presence, and there was mango, there was the neo dime guys that are here. So that was such a pivotal moment because that was when I convinced myself that actually, yeah, I can have a career in web3. And there's products to be built that aren't scams or like, funny pictures on the Internet. Right.
00:20:35.886 - 00:20:55.434, Speaker B: Do you think it was. Do you think a lot of that came from just being surrounded by other people? And you're like, that were also super serious about web3 and you, like, finally saw that there was a group of, like, serious people that had a history of software that were trying to build real businesses. Does you think that's like, had a lot to do with, like, that?
00:20:56.054 - 00:21:31.240, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I could finally, like, I had somebody that I could look up to, basically, that I wanted to be them in like two, three years. Right. And the other thing was that they were so approachable and so helpful. And this is something that I don't know if it really exists in every other industry, but that's kind of like what my experience in web3 has been. And that really made it that I had the energy and the resources to get so much done. That initial build station, I wasn't participating in the hackathon.
00:21:31.240 - 00:22:11.338, Speaker A: I was just hanging out. Cool. But there was a bounty to add something to realms, to add some sort of integration with Solana name service. Back then I was just learning typescript and I remember looking at the realms, the governance Ui, Repo, and it's like to behemoth of a repo, and it's like, shout out to Sebastian Bohr. He really helped me a lot. And Daniel Keller from Sunrise steak. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing, but it was a bit of a goal.
00:22:11.338 - 00:22:34.750, Speaker A: If I wasn't going to participate in the hackathon, then let me see if I can do this. By the end of it, I won the bounty. My code got merged onto a solar labs repo and I was like, oh, my God, like, this is really a stepping stone, right? And, yeah, like, these events in person are just like, huge for the young developers, I think.
00:22:34.862 - 00:23:28.164, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, these are the sorts of stories that I love to hear because after seeing it in Germany, like, you sort of made a comment about, like, having somebody to look up to. Like, I think, like, as these new super teams we're seeing spin up around the world that are pretty fresh, um, like, one thing that Germany had going for it was like some established teams already, but, like, I think as you start to see, um, these newer super teams, they see some success. They get that one or two, like, teams that become successful now, everybody else that comes into their orbit will probably have the same experience that you did. And then, like, everybody is in different levels of, like, it. It depends on regions, it depends on a lot of things. But what you're, what I'm hearing from you is that, like, you had some established teams that, like, you were like, oh, wow, these guys are doing it. That's really cool to hear.
00:23:28.164 - 00:23:41.368, Speaker B: So you did the build station, you won the bounty for realms. So after that, like, usually there's about a six month gap between hackathons. What, what, what was Carlos up to in that timeframe?
00:23:41.496 - 00:24:38.134, Speaker A: Yeah. So I was encouraged basically by the bounty that I could contribute more to the governance ui repo. And so I got a grant from the Solana foundation to do some features for it. And once again, that was pivotal for me to get paid for software by what felt like this huge entity. And I really felt like I was contributing to something really cool like governance. And so I got super involved with that, and I basically started thinking about, what should I do to go to breakpoint? If I go to breakpoint, who am I? What am I pitching? Et cetera? I wanted to take on something a little bit more serious than doing some agency work for NFT collections. And, I mean, it kind of like, I wanted to get deeper into the stack, I guess.
00:24:38.214 - 00:24:38.708, Speaker B: Yep.
00:24:38.806 - 00:25:25.998, Speaker A: Um, and, um. And so that's kind of like where the idea for trigger came about. So, um, a lot of our customers of the NFT collections, they always had these, these requests that it was like, can you take something from here and then do something else with it? Like. And it was always like, take something from the chain and do something else. Post it on Twitter, post it on Telegram, post it on Discord. And so I was like, okay, if this and that looked like for Solana. And so we did some mock ups, put up a little landing page, and then we went to Breakpoint, me and my buddy that I had been doing this from, since the coffee shop.
00:25:25.998 - 00:25:49.530, Speaker A: Right. Shout out to Orion, who just got hired by squads. So he's another success story. But, yeah, so we took that to breakpoint. Breakpoint was incredible. Once again, it was really cool to see how accomplished and how serious a lot of these teams were. And they're building real infrastructure.
00:25:49.530 - 00:25:59.764, Speaker A: And so a lot of the loudness of Twitter didn't come through at breakpoint. Like, I met a ton of developers.
00:25:59.844 - 00:26:04.144, Speaker B: This is the first we're talking about Breakpoint 2021. Right. The very first break point.
00:26:06.124 - 00:26:10.276, Speaker A: And no summer camp, was 2022, so. Breakpoint 2022.
00:26:10.380 - 00:26:40.584, Speaker B: Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, I actually had my times, my days confused years anyways, so. Yeah, so, yeah, breakpoint, even though, like, contrary to popular belief, you see these events and a lot of the pictures that come out of them end up looking like people. Like, having really good time. Like, if you actually spend the time there, like, you realize that it's just, like, mostly a bunch of nerds just hanging out and talking about building on Solana. Obviously, there's.
00:26:40.584 - 00:26:55.322, Speaker B: There's other profiles of people there, like, especially more recently, like, lots of artists, lots of people that are interested in the space from an investment standpoint. But if you go anywhere near the developer's area, it's just a bunch of nerds talking about Solana.
00:26:55.498 - 00:27:18.474, Speaker A: Exactly. And, like, that. These are the environments that I always wanted to be in from when I started this journey. Also, like, you know, like, I'm self taught, so I was looking for a bit of validation, right. But it was really encouraging to see what people were working on. And once again, I had, like, a vision of, like, the type of developer that I could become. Right.
00:27:18.474 - 00:27:46.028, Speaker A: And, like, it really brought in, like, our. Our vision of, like, what a protocol developer or web3 developer is. And so we. We came back from breakpoint, like, super excited. And then. And then I took a bit of a vacation. And then when I came back in January, I was like, okay, like, my grant from the foundation is over.
00:27:46.028 - 00:28:06.044, Speaker A: I just merged my last feature. What am I going to do now? Okay, let me try to see if I can build this trigger thing. And I got into analysis paralysis. There's so many features of building a protocol, and I'd never really approached something that big for the audience.
00:28:06.084 - 00:28:15.404, Speaker B: Can we talk about what trigger is? And this is? And by the way, Carl, you. You placed in the grizzly thon hackathon with trigger, right?
00:28:16.024 - 00:28:37.340, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, right after that. Exactly. So the idea for trigger was if this and that. So there's. There's, like, different no code tools, like zapier or if this and that and web two that people use. People who don't know how to code, they use in order to connect things. Different APIs.
00:28:37.340 - 00:29:09.076, Speaker A: Right. But in a visual editor. And so I wanted to bring that experience into the average person. Right. Because development times are super expensive in web3, and because maybe there are some security situations of, like, you have to get code audited and stuff for it to be safe. And so what if people could do things in a visual editor. With that premise in mind, I got really overwhelmed.
00:29:09.076 - 00:30:07.316, Speaker A: And then I was like, okay, there's this sandstorm hackathon happening right now. What if I built the absolute smallest iteration of this? And so we literally built just an API to connect helios webhooks to Zapier. And then in Zapier, we built a little app that allowed people to create different triggers. And so it meant that through this tool that we called intersect, people could connect. They could do a transaction on Solana, and that could trigger something happening on Zapier to put the transaction into a Google sheet or to send the message. And we did a few demos for that, for Sandstorm, and we won a couple of prizes for the automation track and for the bonk track. And then I was like, wow, I'd never done a hackathon in my life before that.
00:30:07.316 - 00:30:38.788, Speaker A: I had no idea what a hackathon was, basically. And all of a sudden, we won a hackathon. And so that was super exciting. And that was all the validation I needed to be like, okay, let's try for the grizzly thon. And so for the grizzly thon, at this point, I had no idea about anything about Rust, right? So there was the build station here in Berlin. So I went there every day, first person in, last person out, just learning how to. How to write rust, what anchor was.
00:30:38.788 - 00:31:46.986, Speaker A: At this point, all I had done was read data from the chain, right? So I was kind of, like, familiar with reading from rpcs, but that was it. And all of a sudden, we were trying to build a protocol. And so I read a bunch of code from squads, for example, a lot of inspiration I took from squads from the marinade program, and through sheer will and my teammates, throughout the grizzly thon, we put together this demo that allowed you to set basically the limit order in this visual editor. But it was like Lego bricks, and that's what it was really powerful that you could imagine that you could scale this up, and then every protocol could be a little Lego brick, and then anybody could build their own transaction without the need to really know how to code or how they're supposed to go together. So we won fourth place for that. And there was a demo day here in Berlin that we won also some prizes. And then it was kind of just like, okay, let's build this out for real.
00:31:46.986 - 00:32:40.718, Speaker A: Like, you know, the entire code had to be refactored, and all the hard coded things from the hackathon had to be un hard coded. Yeah, as it goes. And for the next almost six months. Like, it was basically just me and a designer. And I kind of hacked at it, you know, and I took it as like, okay, even if I fail, like, I will have learned how to program on Solana by the end of it, right? And I learned a ton. We were trying to do some weird things, like clockwork existed back then. Clockwork is super cool as a decentralized crank, but we wanted something a little bit more modular and more accessible in terms of being able to crank it from some random web two infrastructure, not necessarily a validator then.
00:32:40.718 - 00:33:29.202, Speaker A: Also, if we wanted to extend the types of triggers, we would have had to pr something into clockwork. I decided that maybe there's a design that allows us to upgrade the program without upgrading the program. We came up with these middlewares. We can extend the functionality of the program to CPI into other programs and stuff. And so we played around with a bunch of different things in that design space and talked to a bunch of teams that wanted to use these sort of things for their own kind of like development purposes or like cranking, you know, stop losses inside of their protocols. But, you know, in the depth of the bear market and stuff. Like, I think you, you know, I was, I was thinking about it from, from two perspectives.
00:33:29.202 - 00:34:02.432, Speaker A: From the engineering side of things, it's a super cool tool to exist, but then from a practical business perspective, it's the unit economics of an API like this or a program like this. It didn't really make sense in my head. Even if we were marking something up from the base transaction cost on Solana, we would have been making a few thousand lan ports per transaction, and then we would have had to scale up so much to get any, any sizable amount of revenue.
00:34:02.528 - 00:34:10.304, Speaker B: Yeah, you learned a lot, though. I mean, like, you taught yourself how to build on Solana. So, like, I mean, like, that's. There's so much value in that in itself.
00:34:10.464 - 00:34:59.653, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And so that sort of, like, taking this, I basically, like, built up the entirety of the front end, decided that we were going to be monetizing the front end somehow. So we, we tested out trigger, we released it to a few folks and decided that the no code application was getting a little bit too complex and that it required a lot more scale than we ever imagined. Took a step back and hyperdrive hackathon came about and I decided, let me experiment. Let's build an entire new app on the same program, but instead of built for. For automation, what if we built it for only composability or prioritizing composability. And that's what juicer was.
00:34:59.653 - 00:35:24.634, Speaker A: I always had the idea of trigger as a defi. First application would be super cool, but it had all these extra things that didn't really make it work any easier by simplifying it into juicer and making it only about defi and less about automation and more about composability in a no code way. That was a huge unlock.
00:35:24.754 - 00:36:03.208, Speaker B: So, with that said, enter juicer. Let's give for the audience and all the listeners, a high level overview. Just sort of, as a recap from all this, you built some sort of no code, automated stuff that did a bunch of triggers that made building on Solana easier for yourself. And also other people, um, were actually sort of unable to, like, see the full long term vision of that. Just like. And this is a useful exercise for anybody. Building on Solana is like, you might reach a point in your sort of Solana career where you're like, you built a thing that you had a lot of faith in.
00:36:03.208 - 00:36:20.880, Speaker B: You reach a rope, you reach a point where you say, this is not sustainable. We're never going to be able to turn this into a business. You turn trigger into a tool for yourself to build your next thing, which is like a really cool story. So inner juicer, which is, yeah, juicer.
00:36:20.912 - 00:37:19.694, Speaker A: Is the front end of defi, basically. So we're trying to make discoverability. Like, we're trying to solve discoverability, the complexity of defi, and we're trying to unify it all into a single app. Like, in reality, what we're trying to solve is the problem that when somebody asks you, like, what should I do in Defi? You have to give them a huge list of, of, like, oh, you need to check out this app, but you need to also know what their utilization is in their pool. And then, like, oh, yeah, and this, you can get better yield than this other app, but you should use it for these things. We're trying to solve all of that and simplify the use the all of Defi into a single application. And so the idea is that you'll be able to manage your portfolio, but also connect all these different apps together so that the things that you were before doing in three, four, five different protocols, you can do in the same place.
00:37:19.994 - 00:37:47.978, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, it's an incredible, sort of, like, this is the first I'm hearing about your sort of, like, story arc onto solana through everything, and, like, and now landing here with, with juicer and also placing in the hyperdrive hackathon with that. So, I guess, you guys, Juicer is now, like, live for the public.
00:37:48.146 - 00:38:32.432, Speaker A: Yeah. So recently we started releasing juicer, and, yeah, so, of course, it comes in steps, but what I learned from trigger was, basically, you got to launch as fast as possible and then iterate from there from real feedback, you know, ship fast, break things. Exactly. And so where we're taking a bit of an approach of, like, aggregating a bunch of data from different protocols and linking out to those protocols, and then slowly, you'll be able to start doing those things inside of juicer. And then afterwards, we'll be able to supercharge your experience with these things called recipes, where we're bringing back all these Lego bricks things between the different protocols and building it into this new application.
00:38:32.608 - 00:38:42.310, Speaker B: What's sort of, like, the end game for you, for juicer? Like, what's the in game impact sort of idea for it?
00:38:42.502 - 00:39:44.090, Speaker A: Best case scenario, in two to three years, juicer becomes like the place for DeFi on Solana, and not even only on Solana. The idea is that if you think DeFi, you have a place to go where you understand what's happening and that you can interact with protocols across the entirety of the ecosystem or multiple ecosystems in a single place. Everybody has their own marketing departments. And so sometimes, as a user, it's hard to know, like, oh, how does this protocol call this thing? And how does that protocol call this thing? Or how do they do their math? So, by unifying it, we're blowing the barrier to entry, to all of DeFi, to hopefully be able to bring a bunch of new users into DeFi and then have them feel safe and have them understand what's happening without them having to read a real book or spend thousands of hours on crypto, Twitter to understand what's going on.
00:39:44.242 - 00:40:22.272, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think that's the user experience, and not just because the products aren't user friendly. It's really challenging for new people to come in here. Number one, the perception of crypto in general. And then, number two, some of these products are very scary for a lot of people. Part of it, although, is because a lot of people weren't even taught traditional finance, so how you expect them to come in here? And I actually learned most of my financial knowledge from DeFi because we're not really taught it too much financial stuff. At least in the west, we're not.
00:40:22.272 - 00:40:31.000, Speaker B: I had very little knowledge of how a lot of these financial markets work until Defi. So it's pretty cool to see.
00:40:31.192 - 00:40:53.554, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think a lot of people are exactly like that. Like, a lot of people know the earn button in their bank app, and they know how to click it, and they know how to maybe invest into a couple of things in the same app. And, like, Defi can do all these things just like we've chosen not to yet. And so the idea is to maybe bridge that gap somehow.
00:40:54.054 - 00:41:28.652, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, congratulations on placing and two hackathons, and obviously the most recent one. And so, again, incredible story arc and hopefully, like, we continue to see Carlos in the future and juicer. So to move on to sort of the next segment of the show, I'm going to ask you a couple questions, and I want you to sort of, like, answer these, like, as concise as possible, like, for. And they're pretty poignant questions. So, like, what's like. And you're.
00:41:28.652 - 00:41:40.784, Speaker B: You'll be. I've had everything from core engineers and all over the spectrum, so answers vary sort of, like, widely. What was your, or what sucks about building on Solana?
00:41:41.604 - 00:41:47.722, Speaker A: For me, like, vague errors are the vein of my existence.
00:41:47.818 - 00:41:49.330, Speaker B: I've heard this a few times.
00:41:49.522 - 00:41:57.842, Speaker A: There's also just a lack of documentation, or there was, at least for a long time. Oh, yeah. When I was learning how to, how to do all these things, 2021, you.
00:41:57.858 - 00:42:02.654, Speaker B: Were pretty much screwed unless you knew how to read source code and tests.
00:42:03.354 - 00:42:24.076, Speaker A: Yeah. And, like, or, like, search on discord. Right. And it's really, really, really painful for a new developer, especially if they're a new developer. If you're already an engineer, maybe it's a different story. Right. But for me, it was really, really painful that when you're working on the edge, there's no documentation, there's no example code.
00:42:24.076 - 00:42:42.640, Speaker A: You basically have to get really good at reading open source code. And back then also, there wasn't a ton of it. Now there's so much more. The Solana program examples is an incredible repo. Yeah. But, yeah, vague errors is the bane of my existence.
00:42:42.712 - 00:43:17.308, Speaker B: Yeah. There's multiple flavors of Solana courses. There's eight week boot camps globally. There's so much more than whenever you were there or learning through your experience. But honestly, I tell this to some people. As much as it was painful in the beginning, it was sort of like this, this moat for really incredible engineering talent, because that's who it didn't attract. A bunch of what old heads like to call script kiddies, people who could just go and copy and paste some snippets.
00:43:17.308 - 00:43:54.922, Speaker B: So the base foundation of Solana engineers were either already gigabrain or somebody like, you who just was super dedicated to getting on the other side and figuring all that stuff out. It really started Solana, like, the Solana ecosystem out with a really strong core base of engineers. And then those engineers continue to help other people, as I'm sure that you've mentored people, like, along the way as well. So, um. So, yeah, it's, um. I mean, like, all this stuff, like, we hear we have recurring themes around here, dependency, hell, errors. Um, there's always a.
00:43:54.922 - 00:43:56.450, Speaker B: There's always a. Oh, my God.
00:43:56.482 - 00:43:58.090, Speaker A: Dependency help. Don't get me started.
00:43:58.162 - 00:43:58.926, Speaker B: Okay.
00:43:59.090 - 00:44:00.114, Speaker A: Oh, gosh.
00:44:00.774 - 00:44:20.686, Speaker B: So outside of that, what would you say, aside from the standard sort of, like, it's fast, it's cheap, or whatever stuff, what else would you say is, like, what's good about building own Solana? What makes you excited about it? It could be anything. It doesn't have to be specifically technical.
00:44:20.830 - 00:44:51.844, Speaker A: Yeah. To be honest, I didn't choose Solana. Solana kind of chose me. So I don't know what it's like in other ecosystems, but what made the difference for me was super team. Like, the fact that I had a community around me, supporting me, giving me the resources that I needed, providing me any introduction I ever needed that was pivotal in my journey. And it's something that I always want to share with other people. It's like, first of all, just get involved in the community.
00:44:51.844 - 00:45:04.752, Speaker A: Create your own local community, because it's in these physical spaces where you are really able to advance at a much, much faster degree than you would on your own.
00:45:04.888 - 00:45:58.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like this, like, akshay, who, like, helped sort of, like, coin the term, and also along with a couple others, we started, whenever they started, super team India, the very first one, he was talking to me about communities and, like, bottoms up. And, like, talking a bunch of, like, I was just like an engineer doing dev rail. I was like, what the hell is this guy even talking about? And then, and I've told this story before, and I don't know if I told it on this show, is that Jacob Creech, like, who's head of Devrel now, came up with the Solana cookbook. We were like, we need code snippets. We need, like, something to, like so that people weren't in discord, being told to go look at the tests if they want to know how to send a transaction on Solana. So I told Akshay about it. He was like, this is exactly the perfect example of how we can leverage these communities.
00:45:58.222 - 00:46:59.974, Speaker B: So he just, like, deployed super team India onto the Solana cookbook and had 80% of all the stuff that we wanted filled out in about two weeks. And then I was like, holy shit, this is like the power of communities. And, like, so now, of course, over time, as the new super teams are getting spun up and watching the build stations and watching those collaborations, you start to realize a pattern of, like, this is how you build bottoms up communities and it's just like networks of support across networks of support, and nobody really says it out loud, but super team is very much like a network state and it has its own GDP. It's, it's been incredible to watch. So I'm glad you had that experience and I'm glad that you feel that way about, about super teams because I think this is like an important, like, thing that's happening right now, so, and excited to see what's coming next in 2024 with, with super teams. So.
00:47:00.134 - 00:47:01.194, Speaker A: Yeah, me too.
00:47:01.774 - 00:47:30.358, Speaker B: So to wrap it all up, you kind of gave a really good one there, but, like, I'm going to, like, about, like, it's, what's the, what advice would you give to a new developer coming on Solana? Like, whether they're new or they're just getting started, like, what sort of advice would you give them to? Like, help to achieve success. You just gave one good example about, like, in real life, joining a community, being part of this and, like, but like, if you had to give another piece of advice to somebody brand new, um, or just getting started, what would you say?
00:47:30.446 - 00:48:07.816, Speaker A: Yeah, don't be afraid. Afraid to ask. Like, it's crazy how approachable everybody is in the ecosystem. Read a lot of open source code, actually. Like, get, get good at that because, like, that's what's really going to set you apart. And what else? I mean, it's all kind of path dependent, but, yeah, I mean, just get involved, honestly, because, like, at the end of the day, it's still hard, don't get me wrong, and it's a lot easier than it used to be, but you need a community around you to help you push through those barriers when it gets really, really tough.
00:48:07.930 - 00:48:08.412, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:08.508 - 00:48:11.228, Speaker A: And I think that's what we have a lot of on Solana.
00:48:11.356 - 00:48:59.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, a lot of times there's, there's definitely certain profiles of people, especially younger people, that are afraid to ask questions or there's certain people that are afraid to, like, ask dumb questions. Like, I love asking dumb questions because if you don't ask them, then you'll never know the answers to them. Like, so it really is just like, ask questions, go out there and just, like, be active and be, don't be afraid to engage with people. There's a thousand more Carlos is out there that are going to help you if you need the help. So thanks for, thanks for coming on the show, man. It was a pleasure to have you. It was awesome to hear the journey of you getting started and knowing that you never even had a web two software job in your life and worked at a coffee shop while you were learning to build.
00:48:59.540 - 00:49:14.144, Speaker B: Um, and then even on top of that, congratulations on, um, your recent victory in the, um, hyperdrive hackathon. So, with that said, man, again, thanks for joining, um, and see you around.
00:49:15.484 - 00:49:17.604, Speaker A: Thanks so much. I enjoyed it. Cheers.
