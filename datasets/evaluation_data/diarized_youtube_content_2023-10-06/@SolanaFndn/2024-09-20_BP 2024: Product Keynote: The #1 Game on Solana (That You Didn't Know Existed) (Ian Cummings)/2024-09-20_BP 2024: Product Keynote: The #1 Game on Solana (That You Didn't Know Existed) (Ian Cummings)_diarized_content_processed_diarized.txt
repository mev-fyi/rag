00:00:08.880 - 00:00:48.445, Speaker A: Good morning. So yeah, welcome everyone. I am here to talk about my company. We jumped ahead. I am the founder of Third Time Entertainment. You may know me previously as the creative director of the Madden football franchise and here really excited to share with you something we've been passionately building for nearly nine years in the making. This is a bold vision we always had to create a horse racing game that was more of an open ecosystem where real money was on the line, where skill based gameplay was at the core.
00:00:48.445 - 00:01:49.117, Speaker A: And we chose to bring this game to Solana for its, its security and really the vibrant community that Solana brings. So I'm proud to say we really have built something remarkable at this point. Photo Finish Live is really blazing new trails to showcase what's possible from a game in Web3. Since launching in April of 2023, Photo Finish has seen steady growth, really on the back of best in class engagement, retention and spend. The core web3 integration of this game has seen over 7 million USDC paid back to the track owners, the players that are staking our crown token every minute of every day. Players are racing, they are breeding, they are fully immersed in this virtual horse racing world that we've created. And yeah, breeding is a little weird, but they do it.
00:01:49.117 - 00:02:27.275, Speaker A: We have been setting ourselves up for mainstream appeal this whole time. The millions of sports fans and horse racing fans, as well as the betting community worldwide. And we are now the only official gaming partner of the biggest name in the sport, the Kentucky Derby. Thank you. Yeah, that's all right. But as we have strived to scale up and reach new heights to this game, we continue to face significant challenges. The easiest data point for everyone, I think to look at is that many investors really no longer take this space seriously.
00:02:27.275 - 00:03:11.831, Speaker A: There are much fewer left that even believe in the power of gaming in Web3. And we've seen a nearly 90% drawdown in funding of Web3 game development projects since 2020 22. So why is this? I think my first question would be, well, where are all the damn games? 5 billion VC dollars got plowed into web3 gaming projects in 2021 and 2022. Where did the money go? And so we can point the finger at grifters or we can point the finger at, you know, VCs picking the wrong project. I don't really know. We can kind of realize the past is past and it is time to alter that trajectory. This is the situation we're in now, though.
00:03:11.831 - 00:04:06.205, Speaker A: Traditional game developers really dismiss this whole space that we're in. I hope everyone realizes that it's cluttered, they think it's all scams, they think it's all over promises or under delivers. And VC and investors continue to possibly prioritize short term gains. You see these early token launches really focusing on hype rather than sustainability, which is a struggle. But we are here to lead by example to create these games that onboard not just gamers but professional game developers to really attract more professional teams to this space. And so that's why I am thrilled to announce as of right now, hopefully this clicks. Photo Finish is now the very first real money horse racing game approved by Apple in the world.
00:04:06.205 - 00:04:21.801, Speaker A: Thank you. And the exciting news. We're also a launch day partner with a seeker. Also another round. There you go. Please clap. So at the same time, we're still working on a live streaming app.
00:04:21.801 - 00:05:05.327, Speaker A: So our goal is really to exit the bubble of crypto, right? It's getting, getting from thousands of users to millions and this is getting us into the mainstream as well as some new partners. So I'm not announcing these today, but the journey is never ending. We continue to work on these landmark partnerships across the betting and racing industries across the entire globe. These aren't just milestones for us. We really hope that they are calls to action for the entire Web3 gaming industry. We're currently raising our own venture round, but at the same time, I'm more than happy to help any team that needs to raise or I'm also happy to help any VCs that need an extra pair of eyes. If you're looking at projects, we can all raise the bar together.
00:05:05.327 - 00:05:48.125, Speaker A: I think building for mainstream audiences on every device. Let's please just build more games, build more apps collectively, I know we can do this. So to sum up, I of course would be thrilled if you all want to join Photo Finish, you want to start breeding yourself, feel free. But if you want to check out Gamer Village today, we have a really special event today and tomorrow. Swing by, get your very own nft and we're putting on a special race tomorrow on the main stage. So all of these big name personalities within Solana are going to be racing on the main stage tomorrow. If you pick the winner, we even have some free bottles of champagne possibly that might be given away.
00:05:48.125 - 00:05:53.425, Speaker A: Going to be a great event. So thank you so much. I'll see you all in Gamer Village.
