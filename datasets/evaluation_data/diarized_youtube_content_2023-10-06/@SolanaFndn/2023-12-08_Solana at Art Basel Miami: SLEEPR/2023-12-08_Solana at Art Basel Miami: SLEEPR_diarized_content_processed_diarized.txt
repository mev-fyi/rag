00:00:01.760 - 00:00:40.674, Speaker A: I'm sleeper. I'm an anonymous australian artist, and my work explores the intersection of art and science and the role that artists can play in documenting these inner imaginary worlds. I'm an anonymous for a reason. It's a protective measure so that I can create work objectively. It's kind of the nature of scientific work to distance the individual from the actual documentation of these very personal, vivid, imaginative experiences. Solana has really afforded me the opportunity to retain authenticity while remaining anonymous. Solana has honestly changed my life.
00:00:40.674 - 00:01:17.614, Speaker A: I was a practicing artist in Australia, but had a really difficult time in finding collectors and people interested in exploring this new wave of modern art. And the most kind of beautiful part of Solana is that all the tech and the blockchain ends up just kind of becoming invisible. It's just this infrastructure layer that enables creatives to very quickly and easily mint and create work and share and trade and play with all of these innovative technological solutions. I really invite the patrons at Artbassel to pick up the phone and to talk to me and engage in a way that they haven't before.
