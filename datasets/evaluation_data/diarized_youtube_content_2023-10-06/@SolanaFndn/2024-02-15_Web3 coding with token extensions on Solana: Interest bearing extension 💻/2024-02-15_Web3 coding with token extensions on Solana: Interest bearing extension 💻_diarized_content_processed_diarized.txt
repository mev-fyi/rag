00:00:00.200 - 00:00:25.118, Speaker A: Did you ever want to create a token which creates interest over time? Well now you can. So with the interest bearing tokens extension it's as easy as defining the interest rate when you create the token. So here you can see how it looks like on chain. So this token is now an interest bearing token with the current rate of 0.1% and if you use JavaScript you can actually see this token grow in real time. So here you can see every second I get a few extra thousand tokens. So this is super cool.
00:00:25.118 - 00:00:44.304, Speaker A: There's just one thing that you need to keep in mind. So this extension is not actually creating new tokens by just changing the UI amount of the tokens. So whenever you want the current value of the token you need to use the instruction amount to UI amount on the token program and then you can do with this amount whatever you want. For example use it in a program or something. So yeah, try it out today.
