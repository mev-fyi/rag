00:00:06.000 - 00:00:44.894, Speaker A: Hey. Hey, man. Okay, so this is kind of an office hour, so we'll kind of, like, I think, just can keep an eye on questions and talk about, like, crazy ideas. I like, my. I've been, like, wanting somebody to try to build a social network with some real numbers, like a million to 10 million people that's just tied with a governance token.
00:00:47.354 - 00:01:14.248, Speaker B: Would have been fucking interesting today. I mean, talk about a day for governance of social media. It's. I think it'd be super interesting. And you see, you know, there's sort of, like, obviously the big to do about Twitter censoring Trump today, which I don't know, you know, be interesting to know what would happen if there was a governance token. I think that there's, like. I mean, I totally get why people think it's ridiculous.
00:01:14.248 - 00:01:48.024, Speaker B: Like, it's sort of, like, that's. That's not what Twitter is, but I think it's, like, a little bit more defensible than it seems at first sight. Like, and first of all, just, like, remember four years ago, the amount of that Twitter and Facebook got for not censoring Trump? Like, the amount of think pieces that were written, like, we fucking have Trump because they didn't censor things that were just lies, you know? And now they go back for years, like, all right, we got. It. Hurt you loud and clear. Gonna censor things that are just lies. And then, you know, Otis tweets them and everyone's like, what the fuck? You can't fucking censor the POTUS during an election.
00:01:51.764 - 00:01:53.684, Speaker A: That's. That's crazy, right?
00:01:53.844 - 00:02:24.856, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, damned if you do and damned if you don't. Like, who the fuck knows what you're supposed to do here? This isn't. It's not. It's just like, you know, it's really just not like the sort of thing that the world is prepared for. Like, what? There's sort of these, like, you know, unwritten laws that, like, there's some things you don't do and, like, actually just flat out unambiguously lying. This is, like, one, like, I don't know. And then some, like, frost's outline, you're like, oh, man.
00:02:24.856 - 00:02:37.480, Speaker B: I guess that was, like, not a lot of the universe. It's just like, you know, a thing, and now it's not true anymore. So, you know, what.
00:02:37.512 - 00:02:37.680, Speaker A: What.
00:02:37.712 - 00:03:02.104, Speaker B: What do we do now? Like, what's. What's next anyway. But, yeah, no, I think governance token of social media would be fucking cool. And I think one thing I know, I've said this a few times, but, like, you can actually do it on, like, on salon, you can actually do it and you can have the social media network on chain. And I, like, don't actually know exactly why that's better. Like, I think it might be way better. I like, it's not like that's exactly the thing that's obvious that social media is missing.
00:03:02.104 - 00:03:37.110, Speaker B: But I think it would be really cool. I think even more than that, it's a really cool kind of power play and a really cool, like, like, think of the number of dapps, which are basically taken off chain application, and then, like, have the payments for it be on chain. Right. That's the whole thing. You know, it's like, we got this, like, totally off chain business and now, you know, these, like, in app payments technically go through blockchain and that's like, oh, my God, it's amazing. Like, blockchain integration. This is, like, sort of, like many steps further, you know?
00:03:37.222 - 00:04:03.234, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And it's like, the tech is there to build it. You can basically, like, host, like, I don't know, we deployed stuff on our wave and it's always going to be there. And it points to a running state in Solana, which is always going to be there. Now you have this, like, persistent, high fidelity, like, high quality website, and you can kind of, like, scale it to very large number of people, which is you can.
00:04:03.314 - 00:04:21.496, Speaker B: And you can sort of do the math and it kind of works. I mean, it's like, like, it's. I don't think it's obvious from the outset that it does, but. Well, I think it actually sort of was. Right. Like, like, one interesting thing about, you know, social media or social networks is, like, how fast do they need to be? There's just sort of an answer to that, right? Like, it's. It's people clicking buttons.
00:04:21.496 - 00:04:42.640, Speaker B: Like, if you click a button and, like, ten minutes later you're like, oh, fuck. Like, busy time post hasn't hit yet. Like, that's super frustrating. You know, the times. It's human timescale. It's like, you know, half a second is fine, which is the speed of Solana. Like, it has the speed for it and it's a massively parallelized system, which is great for Solana.
00:04:42.640 - 00:05:02.984, Speaker B: I mean, you can. It's a really good fit for the memory storage model of it. And, you know, the cost. It's economically paying a hundredth of a penny to tweet something that's, you know, that's the right ballpark. Like, you know, it's. Yeah, I'd just be super interested to see people, you know, try that out.
00:05:04.004 - 00:05:12.344, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you guys, like, at FTX, you guys launched this kind of trump coin?
00:05:12.964 - 00:05:13.744, Speaker B: Yep.
00:05:14.724 - 00:05:24.544, Speaker A: But, like, the hard part with, like, doing it on a decentralized system is, like, the settlement. Like, who decides who actually did trump, win or lose?
00:05:24.944 - 00:05:31.324, Speaker B: Oh, it's a fucking nightmare. Yeah, no, good answer.
00:05:31.944 - 00:05:46.384, Speaker A: There's always, like, this long tale of, like, really hard, like, oracle, like, Auger. Like, and, like, I believe Auger has, like, a council of elders that finally decides.
00:05:46.504 - 00:05:49.568, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, another, another renamed Multisig.
00:05:49.736 - 00:05:50.444, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:50.944 - 00:06:27.256, Speaker B: I mean, I think it's actually quite bad. Like, it's. It's interesting because, like, a lot of pieces of this are, like, seem like a natural fit for defi, but, like, the oracle is such a fucking important piece of this thing that, like, prediction markets are actually not the world's best fit for defi at very least. Like, you need to think very hard about some things and no one's done it. Like, you know, the problem, it's not like the, like, the fundamental problem. Like, the fundamental problem is like, the president isn't on a blockchain. Like, he's just not.
00:06:27.256 - 00:06:55.636, Speaker B: I mean, there's not like, oh, man, like three. GF 5721. That's where Trump is. Like. And because the president's not on a blockchain, there's literally nothing you can do on chain to have any idea who won an election. All you can do is say, we handed a key to this guy and now he's going to write yes or no into this address and we're settled to whatever he says. So you don't actually really get decentralization there.
00:06:55.636 - 00:07:19.188, Speaker B: And you can say, oh, yeah. But, yeah, governance took your vote. The problem is, like, again, nothing about the blockchain knows anything about the presidency. So it's not like there's anything enforcing that. That vote's going to go for the person who's going to inhabit the White House next. Like, it could just go for whoever the people who are long the governance token bought in the prediction market. Like, and it's not like there's nothing around it, but, like, it really.
00:07:19.188 - 00:07:22.784, Speaker B: I mean, you really just have to have a reputation based thing there in the end.
00:07:23.324 - 00:07:32.064, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. That is like, yeah, like a reputable council of elders.
00:07:33.244 - 00:08:03.236, Speaker B: Right, exactly. Which is fine. I mean, I think that's the right thing, too. But at that point, you're sort of like, yeah, it's deep. It's, you know, the council of elders is raining it on the chain instead of like, Twitter. But, but the ability to trade, I mean, this is something which I think, like, people are, maybe the world is just realizing right now. I think it's like, there's been a few moments in crypto for me when I've been like, wait, wait, this actually is good at this.
00:08:03.236 - 00:08:43.596, Speaker B: And that's not how I started. Like, when I started getting into crypto, I had no thoughts of, like, this is good at something is entirely like, this bitcoin is trading higher than this other bitcoin. That's a good trade. I'm going to go do that trade. I'm going to buy the cheap bitcoins and sell the expensive bitcoins. But there have been a few moments from, like, wait a minute, accidentally we built this thing that's actually quite good at something. And I think that, like, if you look at like, predicted or Betfair or Vada or any of these places that try and host, like, you know, prediction markets is like, anyone who's trading on crypto exchange and you go trend one of these guys, you're like, jesus Christ, this out of like 1800.
00:08:43.596 - 00:09:01.900, Speaker B: Like, I mean, there's no, yeah, there's no order book. There's, there's, there's no margin. They, they tell you one divided by the probability. And so the probability for, like, God knows what reason that there's no liquidity. You can't even figure out what the spreads are. Like. You have to, like, like, good luck figuring out the fees, how you can't get funds onto them.
00:09:01.900 - 00:09:59.792, Speaker B: Like, they only take wire transfers from like, a single bank in the world. And you're just like, geez, this is like a full time job to figure out how to deal with this shit. I can't find anything. And I think part of the thing is crypto exchanges are actually quite good at that. If you ignore the fact that the markets are trading are usually bitcoin against Heather, what is a crypto exchange at least? It's sort of like, for certain, it's like a matching engine plus a risk and margin engine, plus a nice GUI and API for sending orders and getting market data, plus transparent fees, plus a fuck ton of ways to get capital in and out between credit cards, wire transfers, crypto stable coins, ach, sepA, and everything else. It's like essentially a great underlying structure for any market, including a presidential prediction market. Yeah, FTX is just easier to use than others.
00:09:59.792 - 00:10:15.556, Speaker B: Like, that's our old fucking product is like making those things well. And so it's just like, really easy. Like, it wasn't like, you know, like, okay, this three months, we're going to build prediction markets. It's like, all right, we're listing a new future. This isn't going to be like the BCH future. So label it. Trump.
00:10:15.556 - 00:10:40.966, Speaker B: What's the index? No index. And now you're done. You know, so, and I see someone asked about, you know, inftx has started listing stocks recently. That's the same thing. Like, there's a lot of regulatory work that went into it. Like, that was, the whole thing was like finding a reasonable regulatory setup for this that makes it like, you know, that makes it compliant. But once you have that, it's like, yeah, you know, can we list the spot market? The ticker is TSLA.
00:10:40.966 - 00:10:52.878, Speaker B: There's actually no token for it yet. It's just like, no deposits and withdrawals and like, you know, sort of like, all right, like, most of the other pieces are just there already. Yep.
00:10:52.966 - 00:11:03.914, Speaker A: Yeah, the, so, like, doing the stuff on blockchain is like, easy, right? That's like the same thing. If you have, like, if you have.
00:11:03.994 - 00:11:42.598, Speaker B: If you're not constrained on compute, if you're not constrained on throughput, then, I mean, I think that, like, it's maybe even easier to describe on Solana than some other chains. Not that it's easier to build, but it's easier to describe why it sort of, like, is the same, because Solana just designed this as basically a distributed computer. Like, it's, I mean, I like, often called that, but it's not completely transparent how that is sometimes. But I think, like, Solana, it's like, well, you've got your, like, you know, shared database that you read and write numbers to. And like, you know, that's, that's like what it, I mean, if you don't.
00:11:42.646 - 00:11:46.034, Speaker A: Read and write to the same numbers, we can do that in parallel. Those.
00:11:47.654 - 00:12:18.244, Speaker B: Exactly. It's like, yeah, that's kind of all the hard drive. Like, you know, or, I don't know if it's ram, maybe what effort, you know, I mean, it's like, this is like, clearly works if you can solve, like, have enough throughput, have enough compute, so you're not constrained there and deal with the fact that in order for it to be decentralized, you got this light travel around the world problem. Like, which just means, like, you know, it's going to be really hard to have like, decent decentralization and latency less than, like 100 milliseconds.
00:12:20.494 - 00:12:27.554, Speaker A: What are, like, I guess, like, what do you, what would you want people to, like, try to do that's, like, out there.
00:12:28.254 - 00:13:16.818, Speaker B: Yeah. So the first thing that I'll say is, like, um. There's sort of, um. A lot of people try to do the thing that's completely wacky and insane and crazy no one thought of before. And it's, like, sometimes incredibly valuable, and I really don't want to undercount that. But if you look at where a lot of value in the world is, a lot of it is, like, putting together pieces that are already there and doing the kind of, in retrospect, obvious thing, and just, like, doing the thing no one's done before. That seems like, obviously someone should do it and doing it well and actually shipping it, like, finishing it and releasing it and doing a good job of that, and it's massively underrated.
00:13:16.818 - 00:13:47.562, Speaker B: And you look at FTX and what were its innovations? Cross margin. That's just how everything except crypto exchanges work. Liquidation parameters that aren't insane. I don't know if innovation is the right word for just having an instinct for how much risk, like, a system can take. Like, you know, a lot of these things were not shocking, especially in retrospect. I think sometimes people are shocked when we release them. But you think about it, like, okay, no, obviously, like, that's a natural thing to do.
00:13:47.562 - 00:14:22.940, Speaker B: And I think, like, when I think about serum, like, there are some things that I think would be really wacky and fantastic, but there's also just a lot of things I think are just straightforward and fantastic. And, like, I mean, order book was the first one, right? Like, just have an on chain order book, like, gotta happen. So that's sort of the first thing there is, release. But, like, you know, borrow lending program on Solana that's fast and liquidates on the order book. I mean, again, it's not. It's not like an idea no one's had before, but it just instantly is the best crypto borrower lending program in the world. So that's pretty cool.
00:14:22.940 - 00:15:04.008, Speaker B: Like, that's worth a lot, you know, and especially if you design it well, and then you have, like, what else can you do? I mean, composing all these things the obvious ways. Get margin derivatives and composing with Oracle so you can get price feeds for markets forever you want. Those are some of the obvious things, I think. Like, pretty much any product that you see in finance, right? You're like, can we make that on chain? Yeah, probably you can. So, yeah, make it. Like, like, honestly, I think that's a good place to start. Right? Like, what does it mean to have, like, the Defi Robin Hood? I don't know, just start by literally copying Robin Hood, right.
00:15:04.008 - 00:15:38.644, Speaker B: But making it on chain and like, that, that's a good place to. And I'm not saying don't innovate, but, like, don't try so hard to innovate that you forget to build the product. And, you know, I think other things, things that aren't finance is sort of the other, like, category of stuff. And I think social networks is, like, an obvious place to start instant messaging. Facebook, Twitter, those could all be on chain. You know, I mean, audius is, like, starting to push the boundaries of on chain media. And I think there are some other projects that are looking into that as well.
00:15:38.644 - 00:16:05.124, Speaker B: And so now you're just thinking, like, companies, like, here's a company, like, could it be on chain? And if you're like, yes, it could be on chain, then maybe make it on chain, or, like, bare bones version of it that does the core thing. That's really, I think the strongest intuition here is just build a thing, you know, people want because people already are using something like that, and build it on chain and make it well and release it.
00:16:08.184 - 00:16:30.304, Speaker A: Do you think, like, doing something really kind of dumb like a maker pool, where, like. Like, you, like, dump liquidity into a pool? And then I, like, place orders and I. And I can only place them in, like, weird. In, like, kind of inside the normal branch of the order book.
00:16:30.764 - 00:16:53.454, Speaker B: It's an interesting question. It's really tricky to get something like that right. And it's all going to come down to, like, partially going to come down to the details, but partially going to come down to, like, what is it that you're trying to do in the first place? And it's like, why is that a thing you want? I think it's the first thing I'd say instead of an order book. Like, why isn't order book the thing you're saying? And what's the answer?
00:16:53.914 - 00:17:01.122, Speaker A: I want an order book, but I want, like, I have. I want, like, this, like, passive liquidity experience to the order book.
00:17:01.218 - 00:17:02.722, Speaker B: Like, as a maker or as a.
00:17:02.738 - 00:17:12.814, Speaker A: Taker, as a maker. Like, I'm a. I am a dumb lp. I want to put things into a pool because this is what this is. This is what we do.
00:17:13.603 - 00:18:22.464, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, I think that, like, I mean, there's a lot of ways to go there. And I don't necessarily want to say that, like, one way is, like, you know, the right way or the wrong way. I can tell you what I would do, which is like, think about that in terms of like, sort of in terms of like, what's the product that's missing there? And I think the best answer I can give to that is various versions of an algo trading firm on chain. Like, what's sort of the thing that people are really pointing at there is like, you know, you've got like someone who wants to provide liquidity somehow, and you can customize how that is. You can customize whatever algorithm they're using, and then people can trade against that liquidity and probably just put in an order book. So it's sort of like the natural structure for something like that.
00:18:22.464 - 00:18:57.434, Speaker B: And so I think, like, you know, basically, like, I just a market making bottom whose logic is on chain. And there are two versions of this. One is a really simple one that's just a sandbox that new projects can use. Just click one button, you're like, all right, provide. Good job. Now you have some liquidity. The other version is a much more sophisticated thing where you want to do arbitrage in some quant strategies and shit like that.
00:18:57.434 - 00:19:11.434, Speaker B: You just program it, and then you have a bot that does it on shape, whether it's providing or taking. I think that's sort of like the real future of amms is like programmed bots trading on chain on the order books.
00:19:12.054 - 00:19:28.366, Speaker A: Do you think that? I mean, like, I don't know if the programs can run on chain, because that's kind of like an AMM curve is equivalent to that. And like, if I know the logic that's going to execute, I can arbit before it's executed, right? Like, I know exactly what this thing is going to do.
00:19:28.550 - 00:20:09.346, Speaker B: Well, it's not totally clear. So yes, that is a problem with it, but it's not the only problem with it. Let's say it's non deterministic, but you can see its orders in real time. What's a real problem with current amms? The real problem is that their algo is super dumb in that it doesn't move. It's the unched algo. It just sits there at 38, at 39, forever, until someone trades and it still waits until the price is no longer between those bounds and some trades against arbing it. So if you program this algo to like, for instance, only show good markets, like things good to some arb somewhere else, then it's going to try and cancel its orders and get out of the way before you could orbit.
00:20:09.346 - 00:20:44.482, Speaker B: And that takes care of a lot of this. I won't say it's everything. But I think that to some extent, a surprisingly little amount of this is about not tipping your hand and a surprisingly large amount of it is about like having the right trading strategy. But any strategy that doesn't consume market data is like probably not the right trading strategy. So any, like, changing the AMM curve doesn't solve this. It's got to be more complex than that.
00:20:44.618 - 00:20:53.614, Speaker A: It needs to actually like respond to the news and change its price before somebody like, arps the news away from you.
00:20:54.394 - 00:21:12.854, Speaker B: Exactly. Right. And like, will it still get run over sometimes? Yeah, everyone does. I mean, you can't trade and never get run over, but like you try to not just like always get run over, you know, try and like only occasionally get run over. So that's not like the bulk of what's, you know, the bulk of what's going on.
00:21:14.094 - 00:21:30.990, Speaker A: So then like what if I like had like the opposite side of it is like a taker pool where I, people pull in their tokens and some off chain thing tries to run over, like passive, like whatever, whatever they can.
00:21:31.022 - 00:21:55.620, Speaker B: With, I mean, are there amms? It's so, yeah, trivial. It's like not hard to write an on chain bot that just like makes money trading on uniswap. You need an oracle. Sorry? You need to have like, you know, off chain pricing because the liquidity is not on chain and the information is not on chain. So. But yeah, you could do it. The oracle is a tough piece of that.
00:21:55.620 - 00:22:06.304, Speaker B: Right. Unless and until we get to a world where a lot of flow and signals and trading is on chain, you know, the information is still going to be coming from off chain.
00:22:06.804 - 00:22:31.586, Speaker A: What I was thinking is that like you can like create a pool where the interface to trade is the only thing that's available off chain. But like the LP's can deposit and withdraw tokens at any time. So like you have this bot, right, that like can just place orders and that's the only thing it can do. It can't. Like, it can place bad orders but then like.
00:22:31.730 - 00:22:34.014, Speaker B: And you're saying the bot can't consume an oracle?
00:22:34.894 - 00:22:37.674, Speaker A: Well, the bot is off chain so it can actually look.
00:22:38.174 - 00:22:38.886, Speaker B: Yep.
00:22:39.030 - 00:22:50.038, Speaker A: Can, can look at the entire market. Right. But the LP's are like. It's almost like lending to a market maker, right? Like I lend to a market maker that's going to make markets.
00:22:50.086 - 00:23:01.150, Speaker B: Oh, oh, sorry. I see what you're saying. Oh, no, absolutely, absolutely. Be super excited for some students. Not hard. It's anything, I mean you can just do with bullet on serum. Like, basically what you do is anything brand but GUI.
00:23:01.150 - 00:23:34.198, Speaker B: That'll make this moderately easy. Soon you create an ETF effectively, and it's an amm, but you can call it what you want, an amm, you can add or remove liquidity to it. And then rather than have this like side trade feature, you have the account that controls the assets of this amm. Take orders from a particular trader who serves the person managing the fund. And the only things that they're allowed to do, they're not allowed to steal funds. All they're allowed to do is send orders onto the serum. Dex.
00:23:34.198 - 00:23:42.354, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Or you instruct it to do so. Absolutely, yeah, I mean, that's just like actively managed funds, like, absolutely should happen and it's not that hard.
00:23:42.814 - 00:23:57.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be cool, because then you're kind of like allowing LP's to take advantage of off chain information, which there's no, absolutely zero way an amm can do that.
00:23:58.694 - 00:24:52.014, Speaker B: Yeah. So a few, like, a few things I see popping up here, you know, in terms of, you know, what's. What's using Solana right now in terms of mobile apps, which I agree is a cool thing, there is one that I know of, you may know of more. I know Coin 98, which is a wallet, led by a vietnamese team. She's been doing a lot of cool shit, has, among other things, they have a mobile wallet, has a lot of chainsaw, including Solana, and it's also integrated serum Dex. You can trade on a serum Dex through that. I think there's one or two other teams who are working on that functionality right now, but I think there's a lot more you could do on mobile.
00:24:52.014 - 00:25:38.714, Speaker B: And I love people to start porting everything that pops up onto mobile or building native mobile things, anything, like. There's a few I know are in the works, but there can always be more. And I definitely don't think those who are covering the whole grounds of things. And I mean, in general, obviously, most of the world's on mobile, so, yeah, super important to build to keep that in mind when building. Although again, because it's all open and on chain, you know, someone built an app, anyone can build a mobile GUI for it. Like, doesn't even need to be the same team or anything like that.
00:25:40.214 - 00:25:45.154, Speaker A: How many, I guess how much of FDX's, like, users are mobile only?
00:25:47.534 - 00:26:13.942, Speaker B: It depends on how you weight them. So if you wait, like, number of users a lot, volume wise, more like, I don't know, 15, 20%, I don't remember the numbers. It's like a significant number, but definitely less than half the volume because I mean, the obvious reasons. Right? Like you're kind of going like that. Like you're not, you're not going to be convening with an HFT firm in terms of like number of orders sent on your iPhone. You actually be surprised how much volume people get off on a GUI though. Like click traders can do.
00:26:13.942 - 00:26:20.274, Speaker B: A lot of it just turns out like, mice are way more powerful than smartphones in terms of high throughput clicking.
00:26:20.774 - 00:26:25.438, Speaker A: Yeah, you can't beat somebody at StarCraft with a touchscreen against the keyboard.
00:26:25.486 - 00:26:44.594, Speaker B: No, you can't. You have to change the game such that it works on a mobile. It has to be a really simplistic thing there. Just briefly going through a few of these. Yeah, there is wall connect for solid. That's what uses to connect to the Dex. You can use it connect to anything else.
00:26:44.594 - 00:27:20.274, Speaker B: Pools use that or, sorry, steam swap uses as well as do a few other things. The code's all open source. I'll post actually just a link here is a link to where a lot of the code base is for things people are building on serum. It's mostly all open source, so you can check it out there and build shit with it. But, but yeah. What are things that you're super excited about that are building on Solana? Totally.
00:27:21.934 - 00:28:19.558, Speaker A: I mean, I like built this thing with the idea that somebody's going to build an awesome exchange. So everything you guys are doing, it's pretty exciting to me. Like, I think like there's some stuff that I can't talk about, but I am excited about the idea of high frequency oracles or oracles that are high quality and are pretty close to the current market, coming from a real market and fairly close in time. So I think if you know that you're getting a quote from a reputable exchange for a particular, you know, like level one data, right? Like you can actually then price the slippage against what you expect that, the latency there to be. Right. And then, and then like create like a different market, right. Like that that's more accessible or like can do amms and things like that.
00:28:19.558 - 00:28:55.724, Speaker A: So, so that's, that's pretty cool. If you're, if you're like building stuff, just imagine like, I don't know, like what would you do with like, you know, high, high frequency oracle? Like if you had a price update that was a second behind, you know, any market in the world, like what would you do with that? I think there's some really cool possibilities for synthetic tokens and like, much better, like pulled risk, kind of like for lending and margin and liquidation.
00:28:56.914 - 00:29:23.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. Another thing that I would note for oracles is that like you can have on chain oracles, like in particular, I think if you have a spot market on serum, you can just take its last price and that's an oracle for that market. If you want to know what's a bitcoin worth, I think last price of.
00:29:23.786 - 00:29:27.614, Speaker A: Bitcoin until there's flash loans, you have to be careful.
00:29:28.114 - 00:30:05.624, Speaker B: You can bound it. So if you say, like, you know, last price bounded by 2%, around a five minute ewa, if it or something, then, you know, flashlights. Can't do any, can't do anything. It prints out for second returns and doesn't really hurt the ewa much. And so that's also something really nice because then you keep composability. You don't have to worry about bad data or if it is bad day, you can trade against it. So, yeah, if there's any consumer dapps on Ethereum that we'd like to see on Solana, I'm going to be honest, no, there aren't.
00:30:05.624 - 00:30:39.362, Speaker B: I don't know what consumer dapps are there on Ethereum. I mean, I might be missing some, but like, I just don't really think there are many. I mean, I mean, I mean, ours is like, you know, you click a button, it takes two minutes and a few dollars. It's like too slow, it doesn't work right. Audience was one of the few ones. It's, I mean, now it's starting to move some of its stuff to Solana because, you know, but, but, but seriously, like, it's, you go to a company and you're like, would you like to build on change? They're like, tell me more. Like your next sentence better not make it sound like it.
00:30:39.362 - 00:30:54.650, Speaker B: It's going to make their product a lot worse. Yeah, you know, and so, you know, I think. Okay, so compound, right. A borrow lending protocol is a big one. Like really want to borrow lending protocol on slot. If some people are working on it, it's going to be fucking key. You can swap.
00:30:54.650 - 00:31:42.574, Speaker B: There's already an AmM out there. If you go to swap, if you go there and that, you know, it's like, you know, kind of like uniswap, but lot faster and cheaper. So. But yeah, absolutely. Borrow lending, really fundamental to finance and a little finicky, but not that hard for things like macha. I mean, once you have order books, it's sort of like, I don't know, there's a lot of Dex like stuff on Ethereum, just like all this whole cluster fuck built around the fact that they can't have order books if you just have an order book, sort of like, you know, you don't need this like aggregator that puts it in an order book like format.
00:31:46.474 - 00:32:02.534, Speaker A: So yeah, the aggregator thing, it seems like a really weird, like a specific, slow fractured liquidity between inefficient amms. Like it's very specific to that.
00:32:03.044 - 00:32:35.416, Speaker B: It really is. I mean, that, that being said, I think an aggregator on serum, in case people do start fracturing liquidity, could totally make sense. So I don't want to like chat on it too much because I do, I don't think it's needed right now, but I think at some point it might be if people do start launching separate order books for the same pairs, of course you also just build an on chain arbitrage bots, kind of a similar concept. And again, all these things kind of work like, you know, cheap and stuff. But something that I thought would be.
00:32:35.440 - 00:32:50.004, Speaker A: Cool if people could implement is like looking at like, like a Dex market, like being able to just basically click and launch an amm for that market. Like because you have all the information.
00:32:50.984 - 00:32:54.894, Speaker B: In what you mean launch an AmM for that market?
00:32:55.064 - 00:33:11.866, Speaker A: Well, like if you actually click on the, on the serum market and you go to the Explorer, it tells you like everything that you need to know to create an equivalent swap. Like in stick, stick that market in the uniswap, right?
00:33:12.010 - 00:33:17.054, Speaker B: That market meaning not just the pairs, but like use the order book as the curve.
00:33:18.394 - 00:33:25.402, Speaker A: I was thinking just even as dumb as just sticking the pairs there and then letting arbitrage do the totally, it's.
00:33:25.418 - 00:33:49.410, Speaker B: Not that hard right now, right? Like you projectseerm.com dot, you like find some order work you want, you, you pull the SPL token accounts, you click on the swap tab that brings you to swap Dot project, serum.com, click pool, type those in. Like it's not one click, right? It's like 20 clicks. Um, it would be cool to have like a one click thing, I think, like, and the other way too, you find an ammo, you should like one click. Like launch a market. Yeah, base.
00:33:49.410 - 00:33:56.614, Speaker B: Or like bring me to the Dex market based on this, if it exists and if not, create one. Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.
00:33:57.994 - 00:34:13.410, Speaker A: The dy DX thing, this would be kind of like, I think similar to a lending protocol. If you're into options and like building option GUI's and showing the Greeks there's.
00:34:13.442 - 00:34:55.694, Speaker B: A lot of great GUI work to do. Yeah, yeah, I think totally. We're totally separating out the GUI part from the sort of like core protocol part. Yeah, a lot of this is just having a GUI that shows people what they want to see. And the other part just composing borrower lending with order books. Yeah, and you can do everything. So what is serum in a few words? I mean, there's like a lot of maybe ways to answer, but that one is like what, what's like the most ambitious on chain ecosystem you could think of? Another is like, what would you build on chain if like you had the throughput to build what you wanted? You know, you can think of it as like the products that people want trying to build those on chain.
00:34:55.694 - 00:35:27.774, Speaker B: It's like generally like, you know, decide what you want to see built and then build it, rather than like decide what you can build and then iterate on. That is maybe like the biggest sort of like philosophical, you know, approach to it. And so, you know, what is it? Right now there's a Dex, there's an amm, but a lot more coming and a lot of businesses that are building on it too, because it's actually has the structure and the throughput in the chain that can support actual business.
00:35:30.194 - 00:35:33.894, Speaker A: If low hanging fruit projects.
00:35:38.564 - 00:35:43.864, Speaker B: Oh, go for it. Yeah, I've got a less what I'll send also, while you talk.
00:35:44.484 - 00:36:21.634, Speaker A: Yeah, like low hanging fruit. Like, I think if you just kind of played around with the wallet and metamask integration, there's kind of some improvements you can make in go look at the solid code base and load it up. And then if you know metamask, just start kind of populating all the wrap tokens and solid with like a really simple, like hey, click to wrap it like interface. That would be like the lowest hanging fruit I can think of that would like add a lot of value.
00:36:22.054 - 00:36:46.682, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, absolutely. The solid gui could use a lot of work just to give one stupid example. You can create multiple accounts or multiple accounts with the same seed phrase. Chose those fine, but you can't label the accounts, you can't name them. It shows the public key of them, which is frustrating. It's not hard. You're not getting a Nobel prize for it, but fuck Nobel prizes.
00:36:46.682 - 00:37:05.094, Speaker B: That's a free value. That's one thing that I've definitely updated on. It's don't get nerd sniped on only thinking about things that seem hard. If something seems valuable and easy and fast, that's the best thing. Not like a pathetic thing. That's an amazing thing. And, like, absolutely fucking do it.
00:37:07.714 - 00:37:53.006, Speaker A: Um, for, like, yeah. What, what? Bring in the normies. I think, like, um, I think it's kind of a little too early in crypto for normies. I think you should actually try to find, like, weird communities that would benefit from it. Like, I think, like, rac, like, and the music industry, there's a lot of, like, hate between artists and, like, music industry. And there's like, an opportunity to, like, actually build something cool there. So if you're looking for like a, an app for, like, for the general public, find like, a niche of like, artists or somebody that, like, you know, hates Facebook, like Twitter.
00:37:53.006 - 00:37:56.206, Speaker A: Twitter. With, like, censorship resistant Twitter, you can.
00:37:56.230 - 00:38:02.634, Speaker B: Like, I mean, Jack sent to crypto already, right? Like, it's not. I think you'd find it kind of cool if you get the right line to him.
00:38:03.574 - 00:38:43.844, Speaker A: Like this. This is all you need to do is you, you like, post the kind of the last, like ten posts on Solana and dump the long tail history into arweave and you quickly update those, like, you know, the working set of tweets that people see in the front page. Just have those updated in Solana and then dump the rest of the data to arweave and you have this persistent, forever, highly scalable, like super low cost, cheap Twitter that can like, handle like a, you know, infinite kind of, like almost nearly the same kind of like, load. So that would be awesome.
00:38:45.864 - 00:38:46.644, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:47.144 - 00:39:14.294, Speaker A: Like, surveys, like, I think, like, prediction markets are kind of lame, but because of this oracle problem. But if you could like, actually scale out to like 10,000 people, how will they answer this poll? If you can do that reliably, you don't need all this oracle crap in a prediction market because, like, the, then, like, your Trump token could be like.
00:39:14.634 - 00:39:19.774, Speaker B: Right, like whole half of America to ask them who won the election, right.
00:39:20.154 - 00:39:36.654, Speaker A: But if, if you have like, you know, like a good chunk of users doing something and there's a way for you to ask them, like, what will this community say? Like, will Trump win or lose? You can kind of assume that most people are honest, right. And that that stuff will, would work pretty well.
00:39:40.074 - 00:40:17.684, Speaker B: Yeah, it's, it is really, like, if you can get these things rolling, like, there's a ton that you can do with them. I think, like, slightly decentralized is almost the worst thing for prediction markets. Like, either, just like Bob, we trust Bob. He's going to be honest. He's got a lot at stake. Just like, whatever he says he's going to tell the truth or you get a billion people, there's no chance they coordinate. You just get the truth if you pull them.
00:40:17.684 - 00:40:44.854, Speaker B: If you have holders for token who are anonymous but could maybe know each other and about six of them together make up a majority, it's like. And. And they're anonymous or no one knows who they are. That's almost like the most likely to give the wrong answer. Like the most likely to be manipulated. Um, so I. Yeah, I don't know.
00:40:44.854 - 00:40:56.214, Speaker B: Yeah, no, if someone wants to make, to make Twitter on salon, I mean, like, look, if you do a good job of this, like, absolutely. I mean, get a really big ecosyram grant for that shit.
00:40:59.834 - 00:41:02.894, Speaker A: Opportunity for people who don't know how to code.
00:41:04.394 - 00:41:22.554, Speaker B: Yeah. So, well, I can say that, like, you know, I don't know, like, companies I work for, like a third of the people know how to code, two thirds don't. Probably is different for Tolly. Um, but I still fit.
00:41:22.974 - 00:41:25.434, Speaker A: Like, you need a lot of other people to, like.
00:41:25.974 - 00:41:40.566, Speaker B: Yeah, do the other stuff. And, like, here's sort of like an honest answer. I don't really know how to code. I mean, I don't code. I'm pretty shit at it and I. Yeah, there's a lot else you can do. It's, it's less obvious.
00:41:40.566 - 00:42:03.418, Speaker B: Like, if you know how to code, you're sort of like, all right, here's the thing I can do. I'm going to go do it. And if you don't, it's very difficult from the outside to figure out what you could do. It's a lot easier if you're part of a group because so much shit that comes up, that obviously has to happen. What are things, first of all, managing ecosyram grants. Always love people help with that. What are other things? Managing communities.
00:42:03.418 - 00:42:36.274, Speaker B: What are other things? Interfacing with exchanges about listings and things like that. You know, graphic designers, as someone said, like super valuable, you know, media, writing articles, explaining the products, like user testing them. I mean, there's, there's just a lot you can do that isn't project managing. There's a lot to do that isn't coding. It just like, generally has to be like a piece of a bigger thing. It's hard to be like a one man non coding company.
00:42:42.474 - 00:43:11.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I think, like doing some narratives or, like, you know, even, even, like, just talking to the users in the space and coming up with, like, what the hell do they want? Yeah, like, like doing interviews, like that kind of stuff. Like, what's typically done by, like, project, like, product managers, which are, like, user surveys. Crypto really lacks good product managers.
00:43:13.194 - 00:43:39.804, Speaker B: Really. I mean, here's an incredibly valuable thing for a lot of. A lot of spaces. Just, like, a guy who, like, hears that the group is trying to work on something, and then, like, I'm gonna go find who are probably the smartest people in the space who know some. A lot about this, just talk to them about it and, like, get their thoughts and then relay it back. It's, like, worth a ton. You know, the guy who, like, hears things, like, you know.
00:43:39.804 - 00:44:08.290, Speaker B: Huh? Like, I've seen a lot of attempts at that product. What's going to differentiate it? Or, like, I've seen a lot of attempts. They all have these same failings. If we can solve those, that'd be great. You know, I think, like, yeah, I think it's very hard to come up with, like, an overall, like, you know, framework for how to do this thing, but this thing is valuable. We often just call it business development. Like, you try and parse that doesn't make any sense.
00:44:08.290 - 00:44:41.774, Speaker B: Like, what. What the fuck are you doing if you're not developing the business in one way or another? But it's sort of like our catch all for, like, you know, doing useful stuff that's hard to categorize. So, yeah, there's a ton to do. You just need to find yourself in the right. In the right group. Leverage training on Sermdex. Yeah, absolutely.
00:44:41.774 - 00:45:27.300, Speaker B: Be shocked if it weren't there in three months. Hopefully way sooner. Bug bounties are weird. I don't know. They're mixed feelings on them, obviously. They are sometimes quite good. Um, I will just say that, like, from FTX's perspective, as soon as someone uses the word bug bounties, we just want to block them on all social media, because it's this incredibly strong, consistent pattern that, like, if you found an important bug and you're, like, a well meaning person, you probably message us, and you don't use those words since you're like, hey, I think I found a bug.
00:45:27.300 - 00:45:33.304, Speaker B: Heads up. You might want to fix it. Like, oh, thank you. That's really helpful. We'll look into it. That's great. We love that.
00:45:33.304 - 00:46:14.876, Speaker B: And you probably don't ask for a bounty. It's like, that's not usually what people do. Like, sort of like, I will give you advice, but as soon as it's our phrase that way, it's like, 90% to be someone who's trying to create a bug so that they can find it and then extort you for it, and they're always just d dosing you. It's sort of like they have all these fancy words that don't mean anything and are not relevant, and then they just try and ddos you and get you to pay them to stop. That's like what most bug bounties actually are. Um, sort of sad, but it does kind of kill the bug bounty programs and they're there, you gotta have them. But like, you know, realistically, that's not what catches bugs.
00:46:14.876 - 00:46:25.264, Speaker B: That's what, like, you know, it's mostly frustrating whenever things are phrased that way. So.
00:46:29.724 - 00:46:41.694, Speaker A: Yeah, we haven't had too many, too much like luck with those either. But I think, like it.
00:46:42.114 - 00:46:43.334, Speaker B: Yeah, it's tough.
00:46:52.994 - 00:47:27.518, Speaker A: There's kind of like just if you're looking for just like to contribute, like Dev work, like Solana Explorer, you can kind of spend, you know, like, oh yeah, the cool thing, I think explorers are becoming this like almost like ides to like developer tools, but both developer and like user facing tools at the same time. So you can just start adding like, you know, more introspection, more, more icons, like being able to see which icons are actually being traded in an order.
00:47:27.646 - 00:48:07.874, Speaker B: There's so many things like that just make everyone life way better. Here's one, like, if you click on, if you go to the Explorer and you type in like, I don't remember, you type in like an SPL token address, and you can see like the history of token transactions spin off. You type in like a mint address for the token or, I don't remember. There's like some things where it's like, obviously it should be for all of them. I can send a doc, I have a doc written up of like things that annoy me about the explorer and I mean, there's a lot more than this, but yeah, and just like churning through these would be like, you know, a great place to start.
00:48:10.134 - 00:49:17.300, Speaker A: Yeah. And like just the visualization of the, so like, because of how Solana's designed, we, it's pretty obvious how data is in our interacts between programs. If you want to run with that, you can start building almost visual wysiwygs for composing programs. That is, if that's your thing. But the coding side of it might not be as useful as just the visualization side. If you can click on the transaction link and you can actually see which accounts get routed where and kind of like the flow of like interactions between programs would be pretty awesome. Like a lot of the token transfers are, like, flowing through a serum order, but it's not clear where, like, which part of the instructions in the serum book is actually doing the, like, moving money from one token to another, like, from one account to another.
00:49:17.300 - 00:49:19.144, Speaker A: So that would be pretty helpful.
00:49:21.394 - 00:49:49.332, Speaker B: Yeah. In general, I should have put a fair bit of thought into this website. I review it every, you know, every week or so, and, like, suggest some more things for it. So, like, I think it's a pretty good place to look for, like, things to build on serum. It's a little bit shittily structured. I don't, I haven't thought too much about that recently, but. But, yeah, I do think that this is like, here's one thing.
00:49:49.332 - 00:50:26.204, Speaker B: You build a serum dex, but instead of having, like, ETH against USDC, you have like a ETH against a USDC. Like, the aave tokens, you get interest on the open orders. It'd be kind of cool. You can just wrap them with solid, but, yeah, no, in general, like, it's just, there's a lot to do. There's, like, way more to do than there are people to do it. And I think the biggest thing is, like, finding something you have a vision for something you get and doing a good job building it and releasing it. Most people fail one of those steps.
00:50:26.204 - 00:50:41.260, Speaker B: Take Bitmex as a customer if they want. Absolutely. I. Sorry, I should, like, be a little bit more careful about that. Like something, something regulation something, something.
00:50:41.332 - 00:50:43.664, Speaker A: But couldn't really stop them.
00:50:43.964 - 00:51:09.244, Speaker B: Yeah, couldn't stop them if they want to. And I mean, you know, it's. I. I don't know. Like, if you were me, would you have pitched Bitmex on this? Maybe that wouldn't shock me if I weren't me, but were looking at me from the outside trying to decide what I had done. Here's like a fun fact. It's fucking easy to build a serum Dex.
00:51:09.244 - 00:51:37.024, Speaker B: I mean, the Dex is there. It's just a Gui, right? And we have this thing here. So, like, you know, if you want to host a GUI on serum, it's, it's very easy. This recipe for, it's all open source and you want to customize it. Great. This is actually one of my favorite selling points for it is we have this. If there's any of these, I don't mind sharing.
00:51:37.024 - 00:51:49.624, Speaker B: What are the answers here? Oh, God. She had a super generic one. All right, someone give me a major exchange.
00:51:52.284 - 00:51:53.424, Speaker A: Good tricks.
00:51:55.024 - 00:52:01.032, Speaker B: Oh, boy. Okay, got a lot there. Let's see. Do we have this one system coin?
00:52:01.128 - 00:52:02.084, Speaker A: Those are all.
00:52:02.904 - 00:52:36.944, Speaker B: Oh, boy. All right, bitrix is the first I heard. So this thing I'm going to send is not built by Bittrex, not endorsed by, is nothing to do with it, but it's. If you want to know how easy it is to launch your own dex, your own branded Dex on serum, the answer is, it's easy. There are a lot of these floating around. These are not hard. Literally, we just put a logo in the corner of a website.
00:52:36.944 - 00:53:17.924, Speaker B: And one of the cool things here is that naturally whenever you host a GuI on serum, you get 20% of the fees. Actually more than 20%. Just make a rebates you don't have to pay for, and it just goes straight to you. And so you like, wait, labeled this GUI, restructure it, type into the GUI code, your Solana address for where your fees should go and host it, and you're done. And now you have Dex. And you don't need to get liquidity providers who don't want because you can also just plug into existing markets. It's all on chains, all open.
00:53:17.924 - 00:53:48.874, Speaker B: You can have your own markets if you want. You can create your own bitcoin tether market, but you also just use one that's already liquid. It's like a ten minute process. There's 20 people or so who are already doing this and just super excited for more people to do that. And it's super easy and super powerful. I think this is like one of the I, one of the pieces that I'm like, you know, most proud of, of like sort of high level serum design stuff.
00:53:52.774 - 00:54:03.646, Speaker A: This is like, this is super cool because this is how like Reddit communities like formed just people. Like instead of forking, you can actually just kind of like have your own.
00:54:03.710 - 00:54:41.142, Speaker B: Subs, subgroups compose instead of forking. Like it's, it's, you know, the constructive way of doing it. I think the extent that you can build things to make that easy, I completely agree with a lot of things that are being said here. Whatever, anything. Could we go on for a while if we started talking about charting? But I mean, it's the title of your no sharding podcast. Yeah. Although I still think it's not nearly as wacky as maybe.
00:54:41.142 - 00:55:12.096, Speaker B: I won't say that. Whatever. There's a lot of wacky stuff that's been announced recently. Could be anything but. No, I mean, like, I don't know, people sign computers in a particular way. I think it makes a lot of sense and it's like kind of, I don't know, maybe that'd be a natural place to go with the blockchain. You know, like, memory store is, like, parallelize it as long as you're not trying to write to the same memory store, in which case you have to serialize in that memory store.
00:55:12.096 - 00:55:31.452, Speaker B: And other than that, seems like a natural thing to do. And, like, I don't know, you could have, like, two hard drives that aren't the same hard drive and have them try and, like, talk to each other. Computers don't really do that. So, like, a reason. It's like, it's nasty. I mean, it's. Well, I don't know why I'm saying this.
00:55:31.452 - 00:55:33.704, Speaker B: You know so much more about it than I do, but.
00:55:37.044 - 00:55:51.834, Speaker A: Yeah, just sharding, I think, like, imagine if, like, the markets and serum, like, we're in separate shards, and you have to, like, wait, like, a long time to move funds between screen them, right?
00:55:52.134 - 00:55:58.686, Speaker B: Exactly. You buy bitcoin with USDC, then you sell it for tether. It's like, you know, an hour to sound their own.
00:55:58.870 - 00:56:01.470, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, even if it's not an hour.
00:56:01.502 - 00:56:12.634, Speaker B: Even if it's just, like, two minutes a minute. Yeah, right. And then you, like, get some borrow lending protocol, like, some. Sends in some. Some things. He's kind of marked on one chart. I don't know, it's like.
00:56:14.814 - 00:57:02.508, Speaker A: Just. Yeah, from, like, engineers. You know, if you pay them enough, they'll figure it out, but, like, from a user's perspective, it's just gonna suck. Like, why do I have to, like, know that there's shards and that I have to move money between them? And, like, why does some things take longer than others? It's just like, it's not a system that, like, any, like, this was like, a. I don't know, I heard this quote, like, for some reason way more recently, and, like, this is, um, Jeff Bezos saying that when people ask you what's going to change in ten years, you should think about what's not going to change. And what's not going to change is my customers are going to want things for cheaper and faster. So this is what I'm building my business around.
00:57:02.508 - 00:57:27.804, Speaker A: Like, the obvious fucking thing. People are going to want stuff to be cheaper and faster and simpler. Adding complexity isn't going to help that. Like, no one's going to be happier when. When Ethereum has more shards. It's not going to, like, make it. It's not going to make anyone, like, love Ethereum more when it has, like, twice as many shards.
00:57:29.504 - 00:57:54.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally. And the other thing is, like, I don't know, like, eventually you. You decide you. You need to shard. You might as well be sharding the, I don't know, first build the best uncharted thing you can. Then sure, you can shard that if that's. If that's the direction you end up going in, instead of, like, starting with, like, kind of a shitty uncharted thing and then immediately starting to shard it.
00:57:56.314 - 00:57:57.094, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:58.354 - 00:58:48.494, Speaker B: Um, but, uh, yeah, it doesn't, uh. I I think there's just one of these things where, like, you should always, like, ask, like, what's the roadmap here? What's the plan? And then, like, decide if you should be laughing and if it sounds, like, ridiculous, not in an ambitious way, but in, like, a, like, jesus Christ, who built that sort of way, it's, like, not a good sign. If it sounds like, yeah, that's kind of what I would have done. We're like, oh, yeah, obviously I should have done that in sort of what I was thinking. It's kind of a good sign and ingenious stuff. It's there sometimes in critical places around the edges or tricky stuff, but often it's not even like, oh, wow, that blows my mind. Often it's like, okay, that was actually a really hard subproblem that you need to solve in order to get this obvious system to work.
00:58:48.494 - 00:59:15.274, Speaker B: And I guess they solve, and that's how I think about the time stuff that Solana does. It's not like being able to order transactions is, like, a thing only Einstein could have thought of. It's just, like, actually hard to do in a decentralized way when you really get down to it and to start thinking, like, oh, can you do that? I don't really know. And, like, the fact that you, like, came up with a good way to do is incredibly valuable, but, like, it's not hard to understand why that was the thing you're looking for, you know?
00:59:15.894 - 00:59:46.534, Speaker A: Yeah. And, like, just, I mean, that was, like, luck in a way. Like, it's. You get lucky with computer science problems you don't like, you rarely solve them when you set out to. And the rest was just hard engineering problems that were, like, solvable by experienced humans. Yeah, I don't think I could have come up with, like, oh, build me, like, a CDMA clock that doesn't use, like, a trusted source. Like, ten years spending a qualcomm.
00:59:46.534 - 00:59:54.394, Speaker A: We never thought of anything that could solve that. Right. Like, you're just stuck with, like, atomic clocks or something like that, like, what Google spanner does.
00:59:56.594 - 01:00:18.050, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's cute. And it also shares another thing that I think a lot of complicated, brilliant, tricky, valuable things share in common, which is once you explain understand, you're like, oh, actually that makes sense. Like, I kind of get an intuition for how it works, even if I don't know all the details. I think that's just like another good sign.
01:00:18.082 - 01:00:18.426, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:00:18.450 - 01:01:06.204, Speaker B: Like, I kind of feel like if you spend it, if you have like some context on like the general problem, you spend like 20 minutes trying to understand basically roughly what something's doing. You still have no idea what they're talking about. It's like sometimes that you're stupid or they're smart, but like, more often they're just like, rather than trying to solve the problem, they're just trying to, like, to throw so much complexity at what they're doing that it's going to be impossible for anyone to figure out whether it's useful or not. And everyone just think it's useful because like kind of you feel shitty saying like, that's not useful, but also I'm too stupid to understand it. Like, that's not, you know, that that's an uncomfortable position to be in. So people give the benefit of the doubt to things they, that seem like they're too smart and complicated to understand. But I think often the answer is like, if you can't even sort of basically understand kind of what it's doing after like 20 minutes of having explained to you, that's a bad sign.
01:01:06.204 - 01:01:08.856, Speaker B: Yep.
01:01:09.000 - 01:01:32.790, Speaker A: Yeah. Often, like simple things, like can, especially like in Defi, if you can build something simple that has some marginal utility that probably is going to scale to a larger audience than like something complicated. Yeah. So like, or at the very least.
01:01:32.822 - 01:02:06.712, Speaker B: Like, the complication only is good once you have a valuable simple thing and then you can iterate and you can tweak and you can make it better and better and better. Like, it didn't start with a complicated thing. Those never work. Like, you started with like a thing you definitely fully understand. And that seems like clearly to have a use. This is true of like so many fields. It's true of quant trading too, right? Like, you know, in general, a lot of these things, they don't start with, like, you throw like ten math phds together and write some paper no one can understand and then like eventually it makes money.
01:02:06.712 - 01:03:08.566, Speaker B: It's sort of like you're like, I want to buy the cheaper thing and sell the more expensive thing if they're the same thing, because it's an arbitrage. Like, that's how it starts out, you know, you're like, I like buying bitcoins at 10,000 when I can sell them for 11,000 and that's step one. And then like three months, you're like, jesus Christ, there's 3 million lines of code now because like, boy, was I not thinking about exchange withdrawal limits when I started this problem. And now you have all these complicated functions to model the difference between a coin based bitcoin and bit stamp bitcoin. You've got ew maze all over the place and you're like, oh, yeah, you can get an extra half bip out of this thing if I buy ripple on this exchange. And you're like, I got this signal, and your signal is worth a 10th of a bit or something, but you stack enough of them together and you get up to a bip. It started with, like, you want to do arbitrage and you just like, make that better over time and you like, tack on or like improve the thought or the logic.
01:03:08.566 - 01:03:21.274, Speaker B: And like, this might change at some point. At some point you might get really true machine learning models that are doing like, high level things, like, not there yet, but I don't know, it's like, computers get more powerful over time.
01:03:22.534 - 01:03:38.824, Speaker A: This was what I tried for like, a long time and failed. What was I like, would get options. Data from these options, literally.
01:03:40.564 - 01:03:42.384, Speaker B: Options are a fucking mess.
01:03:43.324 - 01:03:49.304, Speaker A: I would throw every machine learning model I could.
01:03:51.754 - 01:04:28.632, Speaker B: The problem is that, like, you don't. It's so hard to know what study to do until you figured out what trade makes money. And once you know it, then you can start to figure out what study you need to do. But, like, if when you're thinking about options is not deeply ingrained in your mind that, like, some options have ridiculously large tick sizes and all the microstructure implications that has, you're definitely not going to be doing the right studies. You know, like, that just like, dominates the trading of some options. Just the fact that, like, everyone knows it's obviously worth something between these two ticks. And you can't price it, you can't trade it except at those two ticks.
01:04:28.632 - 01:04:38.844, Speaker B: So, like, you know, all the pricing goes out the window and it's all just a question of, like, can you buy on the bid and sell on the offer? If so, great. If not, then, like, you're never going to trade, you know?
01:04:40.504 - 01:04:52.954, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah, but that's kind of like, it's just like, yeah, it's basically like, I think also, machine learning is really, really easy to overtrain.
01:04:53.534 - 01:05:17.344, Speaker B: Oh, it's so easy. It's unbelievably easy. Like my favorite example recently. Fuck. It was some major, maybe New York Times model, some. Some election prediction model was a fundamentals based model. And it's built by a smart Andrew Gelman Naden.
01:05:17.344 - 01:05:48.890, Speaker B: He's like a smart guy who's known for being good at this shit. But he starts off saying, look, the problem with these fundamentals, economic models for presidential elections, is they always overfit. There's not enough data points. Here's how we solved it. And it's this hilarious next two paragraphs where he's like, well, first, see, we have 18 data points. We tested 100 different values for this one variable, backtesting on these 18 data points to tune it to the best number. Then we did these other two statistical modifications on it.
01:05:48.890 - 01:06:03.916, Speaker B: Then we tried to estimate COVID, and this is the number we chose for that. And eventually it's like, okay, you're up to 1000 parameters. You had 18 data points. The fuck do you think it could happen? You know?
01:06:04.060 - 01:06:08.784, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. The odds are 50 50, right?
01:06:09.124 - 01:06:33.084, Speaker B: Yeah. At some point you just end up with, like, something which is, like, honestly not more valuable than that. And it's just you can get whatever answer you want. You just like, keep training it, you know, eventually it'll do what you want. It's not hard. There aren't that many data points that you need to fit it to. And, I mean, I think any attempt to model this election was very close to fucked.
01:06:33.084 - 01:06:55.920, Speaker B: I just think, like, you can look at almost any model and say, that's not going to be very useful. It's like COVID. COVID changed the election in a lot of ways they'd never done before. And if you're not thinking about, like, absentee ballots, when you're modeling it, then, like, you're kind of just putting your finger in the wind and. Or taking polls. You know, there's sort of things you can do. But, like, I mean, you know, any.
01:06:55.920 - 01:07:05.244, Speaker B: Anything other than that. Like the odds that you're missing a dom, a completely dominant factor and replacing it with a bunch of irrelevant overfit noise. Just like, so high.
01:07:08.344 - 01:07:09.124, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:07:14.824 - 01:07:44.130, Speaker B: So our markets controlled by a few people. What type of markets are you thinking? Like stock markets, crypto markets, prediction markets, shopping markets. I don't know. It's different for different ones. This is Linus in chat, asked basically, is it the whales? Is how I'm sort of translating it. Is it always the whales? Stock markets no is a better answer than yes. It's not.
01:07:44.130 - 01:08:07.246, Speaker B: It's. I mean, different things in different cases, but, like, in general, the whales narrative sort of, like, overplayed a bit. And, you know, sometimes you're like, it was the whale. What they really mean is, like, that was a one and a half percent move in the S and P 500. That was the whale. Sort of, like, explained a third of the variants on or half the variants on a single day. And you're like, great, we found a whale.
01:08:07.246 - 01:08:10.646, Speaker B: And the rest of it's like, it depends on what you mean by the whales, right?
01:08:10.670 - 01:08:14.334, Speaker A: Like, soft think, right?
01:08:14.494 - 01:08:35.262, Speaker B: Once a year you're like, that was softbank. You know, usually, right? So there's. There's the Robin hooders who do matter, the other people who matter. Like, I. Like, I don't know. Anyone know what? Like, I don't know. Maybe the most, like, influential group is in stock markets other than, like, market makers and liquidity fighters and stuff like that.
01:08:35.262 - 01:08:38.110, Speaker B: But, like, so the biggest, like, what's the biggest?
01:08:38.262 - 01:08:40.034, Speaker A: Why do robbery matter?
01:08:41.114 - 01:09:01.970, Speaker B: Um, Robin hooders matter. Because they do crazy. I mean, they don't. They don't do what other people do, right? They're. They. They, like, I. They, like all by Hertz and, like, they just overwhelm the liquidity in something in a way that's not tied to the fundamentals.
01:09:01.970 - 01:09:44.970, Speaker B: Blows out every model and every market maker, and it's just like, all right, it's going up now. Like nothing else mattered, you know? Like, if everyone's buying it, it's going up. Nothing you could do about that. Are market makers illegal? And stock markets know they're integral to them? Well, sorry, market makers. I mean, it's like the basic answers are integral to them, although, like, different people in different things by market makers. But liquidity fighter is sort of like the clear phrase. But I know what funds have the most money, other than governments that usually don't trade on stock markets very much.
01:09:45.082 - 01:09:46.378, Speaker A: Sovereign funds.
01:09:46.546 - 01:10:05.804, Speaker B: Right? So if you ignore those, what's sort of like the biggest funds in the world? Sort of, like, makes sense when you think about it. It's like, not obviously, until you do. I don't know, like, where. Where'd you give a lot of money to? Probably periodically, every paycheck.
01:10:07.824 - 01:10:10.744, Speaker A: The treasury, the US government. Right?
01:10:10.784 - 01:10:27.724, Speaker B: Like, yeah, but they don't go buy stocks. Like, if the US government. If the treasury punted on stocks, absolutely, that'd be massive. But occasionally they do and it's massive, but usually they don't. Right? But there is a group that you do give money to every paycheck that does go punt on stocks.
01:10:28.584 - 01:10:33.164, Speaker A: Who? Social Security? No.
01:10:34.984 - 01:10:52.538, Speaker B: Pension funds. Fucking massive. I mean, you just think about they have, like, what? Like, you know, 10% of all the money in the world or something. It's a lot of money. It's trillions of dollars, you know, and what do they do? They. They punt on stocks. You know, it's like, all right, we're all gonna go buy small cap Europe or S and P 500.
01:10:52.538 - 01:11:13.818, Speaker B: Like, it's biotech week, guys. Let's go buy trillions of dollars of biotechs. You know, and it's like, all right, I guess biotechs are going up and they sort of, like, are very correlated in what they do and. Yeah, so if you want to know. And they're not, like, manipulative. Like, it's not like the whales and sort of like, scary sense, but, like, they're big. They.
01:11:13.818 - 01:11:29.076, Speaker B: I don't know, markets, they have impact when they trade. The impact isn't the goal. It's like a side effect. But, like, you know, they're. Yes, the Fed did buy. Sorry, it did not buy corporate ETF's in March. It almost did, and it had massive impact.
01:11:29.076 - 01:11:58.574, Speaker B: The Fed said that they would buy corporate ETF's corporate bond ETF's in March, thus causing a massive rally in corporate debt. And so the Fed didn't actually need to buy them. Sort of a cool, cool feedback loop there, but, yeah, actually just saying that they're going to do it turned out to be way overkill and they didn't need to buy a penny of it. But distressed debt was immediately not distressed once people knew the government was going to buy it. Except it didn't.
01:12:00.114 - 01:12:01.934, Speaker A: What a weird world, man.
01:12:02.794 - 01:12:34.614, Speaker B: It's a really weird world. By the way, Matt Levine, if you guys don't read him, if you want to know what's going on in finance and have fun while doing it, absolutely. The best thing to do is read column called money stuff by Matt Levine. He's on paternity leave right now, which is shitty and unfair. Should not be allowed because his articles are fun to read. But once he comes back, you should read. It's just like, it's better than anything else about it and it's more interesting and insanity and fun.
01:12:34.614 - 01:12:44.034, Speaker B: So this is our. This is our dad coming on to tell us that it's time to go to bed.
01:12:44.534 - 01:12:55.374, Speaker C: That's right. Time to wrap up, guys. But it was super helpful. I think everyone really enjoyed all your guys insights and ideas. On projects and what you can build on Sam and Solana. So thanks. Thanks for your time.
01:12:55.374 - 01:13:19.684, Speaker C: And, yeah, just letting everyone know we'll have another office hours, but it'll be more technical around, like, 08:30 a.m.. GMT. Try to get in different time zones. But, yeah, thanks. Thanks so much, Anatoly and Sam. And, yeah, you guys have any future ideas, just post them on Twitter, tag us in it, and, yeah, it'll help out everyone. Projects.
01:13:20.904 - 01:13:33.874, Speaker B: Great. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, everyone, for listening to us bullshit for an hour. Hi, guys. See you guys. Bye.
