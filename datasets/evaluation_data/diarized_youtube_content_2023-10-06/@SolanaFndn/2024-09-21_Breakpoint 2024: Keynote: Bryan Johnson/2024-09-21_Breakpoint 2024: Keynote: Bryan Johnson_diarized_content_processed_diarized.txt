00:00:06.320 - 00:00:31.335, Speaker A: All right, you motherfuckers, we're talking about sleep today. How many of you have slept more than four hours per night this week? Five? Six? Okay, this is bad news. Everyone stand up. Stand up. Okay, we are going to change your relationship with sleep today, okay? We're going to talk about five habits. Reach up, get into a different mind state. You're ready to change yourself, all right? Back down.
00:00:31.335 - 00:00:53.111, Speaker A: Okay, Five habits, okay? Now I demonstrated the world's best sleep score. Eight months of perfect sleep. No one has ever done that before. So here's five things for you to do. Number one is you're going to be a professional rejuvenation. You're a professional sleeper, okay? So you don't sleep when you have time. You, you don't sleep when you're done with work.
00:00:53.111 - 00:01:22.665, Speaker A: You don't sleep when you're done with a movie. You sleep because you are a professional sleeper because you know that sleeping is the highest valued thing you can do to be a great builder and human in life. Number two is a wind down routine. So if Your bedtime's at 10, when 9pm comes, one hour to wind down screens off, you stop working. And so what I do is I activate sleep Brian mode. So if I activate Sleep Brian mode, I go to bed at 8:30. So 7:30 comes, screens are off, wind down routines start happening.
00:01:22.665 - 00:01:54.479, Speaker A: Now the moment that happens and Bishop Brian's going to say, I have this new idea that I want to do the following thing. Sleep. Brian says, thank you, Ambitious Brian, we really appreciate you. We have all day tomorrow to work on the following thing. But for that hour of time, you've got to basically take your ambitious self and all the worries you have and push it out to the next day and get yourself ready for sleep. So professional sleeper wind down routine. And in that duration of time you want to do a meditative practice, breath work, go for a walk, read a book, something to wind yourself down.
00:01:54.479 - 00:02:14.272, Speaker A: Number three is consistency. So your body really does well when it can expect what's going to happen. So when I was doing my perfect sleep routine, I would be in bed within plus or minus one minute every night. And it was remarkable that moment would come. My body would just fall into sleep. It was just incredible. So for you, plus or minus 30 minutes would be great.
00:02:14.272 - 00:02:30.571, Speaker A: 60 minutes is okay, but not much longer. Number four is lighting in your environment. Blues. Things like, this is going to wreck my sleep tonight. This is so much blue. This is the most blue I've had in I think the entire four years. But I'M doing it for you.
00:02:30.571 - 00:02:52.941, Speaker A: So light matters a lot. You want to eliminate blues. And if you can get a red light bulb, put it into a lamp. And then in that hour, wind down routine is going to calm you down. So if you want to pay attention to the Kelvin, it's like roughly 3,500 Kelvin. You want soft yellows. And number five is your last meal of the day.
00:02:52.941 - 00:03:28.705, Speaker A: So if you can eat your last meal of the day roughly two hours before bedtime, that's great. If you can do three or four or five, even better. So what I found out is the further I moved my last meal of the day back, the better my sleep became. I now have my last meal of the day at 11am you don't need to do that, but it works. So you'll see that it takes roughly six hours for your body to have primary digestion. And so the body has to assign metabolic processes to digest food. And so when it's done with that, it can take all of its metabolic abilities and apply it to sleep.
00:03:28.705 - 00:03:59.775, Speaker A: And so by the time my bedtime arrives, my body is entirely done with digestion and it's ready to sleep. So if my resting heart rate is 47, then it's going to be a perfect night's sleep. I know if I eat something two or three hours before bedtime and if it's even heavy like a pasta or a pizza, I don't do it anyways. But if I did, it would cost me roughly 35 to 45% of my sleep. It's very algorithmic. Now if you do these things, you're going to have five attributes in your sleep. One is when your head hits a pillow, you're going to be asleep in roughly five minutes time.
00:03:59.775 - 00:04:44.869, Speaker A: That's the kind of routine you want to have. When your body says I'm ready for sleep, you hit the pillow, you're out. What you don't want is for your head to be on the pillow and to be rotating, like all the things you have in your mind of the things you want to get done, you're going to get done, things you're bothered with, etc. Two is you're going to be up in the night less than 30 minutes, you'll have roughly two hours of REM and roughly two hours of deep sleep. Those are the metrics you want. Now, who here is a founder that doesn't believe what I'm saying? That does not go to the sleep routine? Raise your hand if you're not going to do it. Why? Yeah, he Says it's very hard.
00:04:44.869 - 00:05:05.715, Speaker A: Okay, I agree. I understand the situation. It is very hard. There is a myth that somehow you're a better founder if you sleep less. It's not true. Less sleep makes you a lesser person. Yes.
00:05:05.715 - 00:05:28.183, Speaker A: And you guys play this silly fucking game, holding each other to ridiculous standards of not sleeping. You tell stories about people who work all night or do whatever their thing. They're amazing. They can only survive on three hours of sleep. That's not true. Okay. My speed of aging is 0.64.
00:05:28.183 - 00:05:53.815, Speaker A: That means I celebrate my birthday every 19 months. You guys have a birthday every four months. Crypto accelerates aging. Is this not true? Yeah, it's brutal. So we humans want to be part of a tribe. We want to belong. We want to participate in the social activities of life.
00:05:53.815 - 00:06:21.465, Speaker A: So when we do it together, we relieve the pressure of fomo. We want to be involved. So as a community, if we can say we value sleep, so much better. So can I get a raise of hands? Who's in on this? Yes. Yes. I hope you guys feel it. I hope you feel that there's permission to get eight hours of sleep, and you don't need to feel shame by getting it.
00:06:21.465 - 00:06:40.439, Speaker A: Great. Thank you. That was good. Okay. All right, so that's first part, sleep. Now, I'm gonna tell you what Don't Die is about, because I think we could do something cool together. I'm gonna go through this really fast.
00:06:40.439 - 00:07:06.845, Speaker A: I've been doing building Don't Die for the past couple years. Normally, this takes two and a half hours to get a group of people together and sit down and walk through the entire thing. We're gonna do it in seven minutes. That means it's gonna leave you with a whole bunch of questions, and you're gonna not agree with any of it, but that's okay, because the seed is gonna be planted. Okay, here we go. All right. So most people think my endeavor is about boners.
00:07:06.845 - 00:07:31.695, Speaker A: It's true, actually. You know what? So this is relevant if you have. Okay, so when I did the boner thing, the. I see my nighttime erections are the length of Titanic. Three hours and eight minutes per night. That is better than the average 18 year old. Thank you.
00:07:31.695 - 00:07:51.635, Speaker A: Thank you so much, everyone. Did, you know, so many of my friends message me and they're like, wait a second. I'm not having any boners at night. What does that mean? They're not sleeping. When you don't sleep, you don't have boners. And guess what? When you don't have boners, at night, you're 70% more likely to die early. It's a really big deal.
00:07:51.635 - 00:08:20.011, Speaker A: And women, you too. Women, you have the same number of erections as men do every night. They're just harder to measure. The penis is much more accessible. We are sidetracked. So anyways, sleep has a direct correlation with nighttime boners, and that is a significant biomarker for your health and wellness. All right, so what don't die is really about is this idea that the most important thing happening on planet Earth right now is we're developing AI and whether you're bullish or bearish, it's.
00:08:20.011 - 00:08:37.471, Speaker A: It's pretty fast. In fact, it may be faster than we can really understand. It may change reality more than we can imagine. Like, you know, like, big deal. Probably the most important thing on planet Earth that's going on right now. And so there's a big question. What do we do? And you look out through the world and everyone's got an idea on what to do.
00:08:37.471 - 00:09:04.985, Speaker A: Like, China's doing their thing, the US Doing their thing within China, companies doing different things. The California legislature wants to regulate it. But, like, as a species, we kind of have 8 billion different ideas on what to do with AI. Sometimes we're scared, sometimes we're happy. But basically, it's like, state of affairs. And my hypothesis is no existing framework of human thought is equal to this moment. Not democracy, not capitalism, not socialism, not Christianity, not Islam, not Wokeism.
00:09:04.985 - 00:09:34.625, Speaker A: Nothing, nothing in existence actually addresses what we do as a species. Don't die, I will propose, is the only framework in existence that is actually equal to this moment. And so it's don't die individually, don't kill each other, don't kill the planet. Align AI with don't die. It's this observation that don't die is the most played game by every human on this planet. Every second of every day, it is your 0th order priority. Every single moment.
00:09:34.625 - 00:10:02.715, Speaker A: Now, when you're not dead, you do crypto stuff, right? But otherwise. Otherwise it's your metabolic priority to do it. Now, that's true across all the biomass on planet Earth, animals and plants, etc. It is the preeminent game of alignment that we don't want to die. Okay, so if you think about this from, like, a much bigger context. So, like, through the swath of humanity, like, what are the big ideas that have come about? Like, Buddha was like, hey, like, life kind of sucks. We should probably detach ourselves.
00:10:02.715 - 00:10:27.345, Speaker A: Muhammad is like, we should submit to God. Jesus, like, I'm the son of God. Adam Smith was like, hey, there's this invisible hand. There's markets. The Americans were like, hey, we the people are going to solve this. These really big chunks of ideological understanding that drive our existence. And so the proposal here is that in this moment as a species, ideologies rise that are equal to the moment in technological abilities.
00:10:27.345 - 00:11:07.989, Speaker A: That don't die is a system of politics, economics, morals, ethics, social everything. And so, for example, smoking a cigarette costs you 11 minutes of life. You can do the same math that a fast food meal is also 11 minutes of life. Burger, shake and fries. So it's a number, it's 11 minutes. That means the ideology is reducible in a computational form. And this is why I'm here to talk to you guys, is the ideologies we have today, like democracy and others, they're not reducible to math, they're not reducible to computation.
00:11:07.989 - 00:11:43.243, Speaker A: They exist in the abstraction with language. Don't die is a mathematical reducible construct. It plays very well with the blockchain. In fact, if we say that the future of language is actually math and it's everything you're building, we should say, is there an ideology in existence that that actually is suitable to work in? Politics and economics and morals and morality and ethics. And so that's what I've been doing for the past three years. I've been trying to become the most don't die person in human history. And so we measured every organ in my body, every single one.
00:11:43.243 - 00:12:19.167, Speaker A: Liver, pancreas, heart, brain. We took the biological age. By the way, my left ear is 64, so my heart is 37, my left ear is 64, my diaphragm is 18, so my whole body. You heard about my erections, right? Like less than 18. But like the body has all your 70 organs have different ages. And then we took all the best science, we applied the science to my body and then we tried to say, can we slow down my speed of aging and can we reverse the aging damage? But you can reduce the entire thing into numbers, which is so beautiful. Then we repeat the process again and again and again.
00:12:19.167 - 00:13:02.499, Speaker A: And so as a system of intelligence, you can take all my biology and reduce it to this numerical system. You can then bridge it to other things too. You can do the same thing for coral reef. You say when coral reef dies, it creates a different marine environment, which means the marine environment dies and et cetera. You can apply a die score of what happens when coral reef dies, or you can say what happens when a certain level of microplastics are in the food and water we eat and drink. What does that mean? Or a politician could say, my district or my country is the most don't die country in the entire world. So these concepts bridge very naturally from daily habits of self, of health and wellness, to political systems, economic systems.
00:13:02.499 - 00:13:34.205, Speaker A: In fact, it is the natural progression of economics where you say the world is kind of broken out into two different markets die and don't die. So alcohol and cigarettes are dye. Smoke detectors, seat belts, building codes, crosswalks. That's don't die. The don't die economy is potentially growing a lot faster than the die economy. So money supports this. All right, so what we're doing tangibly, and this is the bridge to how we can work together, is we started a don't die app.
00:13:34.205 - 00:14:01.375, Speaker A: It's an alpha mode. I'll give you a QR code. We're trying to socialize this idea of numerically. So, okay, quick tangent. I came up with don't die when I did a thought experiment. I imagine being present in the 25th century and you're there among them, and they're communicating in whatever way they exist. And they're saying, can you believe how extraordinary existence is? We are expanding throughout the stars.
00:14:01.375 - 00:14:23.997, Speaker A: We exist in 10 dimensions. It's just this unreal existence. We are so grateful to humans who existed in the early 2000 and twenties. They existed in that moment, that precarious moment when they were giving birth to superintelligence. And they could have fucked it up. They could have just destroyed everything. But you know what? They actually punched through and they made it happen.
00:14:23.997 - 00:15:19.557, Speaker A: What did we do in that moment that allowed intelligence to thrive in this part of the galaxy? I think what they'd say is, they'd say, they had the wisdom to say we're transitioning from death being inevitable to having some unknown horizon of being able to extend our lives into something more magnificent than we can imagine that we saw this moment. In fact, the Schopenheimer quote, talent is the ability to hit the target no one else can. Genius hits the target no one can see. What is the genius move for us as a species? I think it's seeing that we are transitioning death inevitable to some unknown horizon. And what do you do? You align all of intelligence on the single thing we can agree upon is we don't want to die right now. So I want to build with you guys. There's a way to build a lot of incentives around this throughout all systems of society.
00:15:19.557 - 00:15:49.255, Speaker A: We're going to expose the don't Die score. So every day you can track in the very beginning, very basic like sleep and exercise and motion. We can add other things like biomarkers, speed of aging, MRI imaging, a whole bunch of other stuff. But we can basically build this throughout the world and hopefully be the power check on all things. The goal is that a billion of us are going to be self identified with don't die. By 2027, we will be in every organization in the world because we think this moment is special. Thanks everyone.
00:15:49.255 - 00:15:52.415, Speaker A: Oh, and. And go to bed.
