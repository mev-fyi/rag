00:00:00.280 - 00:00:31.673, Speaker A: Danny, what are you building? So I'm building a Solana SDK for Unreal that lets you build games with Solana in the way that they're normally built. Fully native, fully in C, and you can generate any anchor IDL into a fully compliant Unreal module. Wow, that's so cool. I just press a button and I get an Unreal game out of it. Yeah, Grab any program, any idl, press generate and you get a plugin that you can start using in Unreal. Wow, that's so cool. How can I try it out? So right now the best way is to get free support because the documentation is a little bit early.
00:00:31.673 - 00:00:45.505, Speaker A: So what I'm committing to do is if you're building on Solana, if you want to build an Unreal game, I will give you personal one on one support and I'll make sure that everything you need for your IDL for your programs is there. Wow, that is a great chance. Don't miss it.
