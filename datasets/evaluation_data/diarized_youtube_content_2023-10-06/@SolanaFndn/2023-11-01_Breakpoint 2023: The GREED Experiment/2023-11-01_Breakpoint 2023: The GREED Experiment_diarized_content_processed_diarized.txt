00:00:04.240 - 00:00:41.708, Speaker A: Hello, subjects. By the show of hands, how many of you gave me their Twitter permissions earlier this year? Oh, this is great. There's going to be a lot of people that hear it for the first time. Did the rest of you hear about greet before? Amazing. So in this talk, I'm going to be explaining how the whole thing went on, how it started, why did we do it, and show you some funny details from that period. So let's find out how we got to this. It's mostly because of people who got their hands up.
00:00:41.708 - 00:01:25.784, Speaker A: Thank you for making me a speaker this year. And let's learn how we made slope. Who, after losing a lot of people's funds and not tweeting anything for nine months, tweeted our greed manifesto. It all started during what they call a shitcoin season, which, if some of you didn't participate in them, how those few weeks usually look is you have 1015 new mints every day. There's going to be a Twitter account minutes old named by an animal or a fruit. They're going to say, we're launching tonight. And then some groups are just going to go, oh, this one looks good.
00:01:25.784 - 00:01:55.642, Speaker A: You have no idea why it looks good, but if three groups say it looks good, everybody just wants to throw money at it. And it's frustrating. And I feel very strongly about this kind of behavior and dynamic not really moving crypto forward and making people outside think we're just a bunch of degens in a casino. And it triggers me. One of these evenings, somebody came to me and asked me, do you know this guy? I'm like, yeah. Why? He's launching a token. I'm like, of course he is.
00:01:55.642 - 00:02:27.816, Speaker A: And just before going to sleep, I decide to kind of make a joke on Twitter. I'm thinking like, how do I tell to people, please stop being this way. How do I make it a bit funny? And I decide to tweet. Are you guys ready for greed? Thinking everybody's going to understand its satire, it's intended to be like a social commentary. I, of course, said the two most generic engagement farming sentences. Afterward, as everybody else launching a token, I go to sleep. I'm thinking tomorrow I'm going to wake up.
00:02:27.816 - 00:02:49.474, Speaker A: People are going to be like, haha. Yeah, you're right. We're probably. That's not really how it went. I woke up with tens of thousands of views on that tweet and everybody was like, when? When's the token? How do I do this? All the DM's, everything is going crazy. And I'm thinking like 50 50 was the worst I was hoping for. This was like one person sent me a message.
00:02:49.474 - 00:03:10.414, Speaker A: Like, nice joke. Everybody else was all over my token. So now if I go now and say, haha, I'm joking, 99% me. Like I'm the one looking like a fool. So I'm like, how do I fix this? Now let me double down. Let's ask all these people to quote, retweet and say, I'm doing it because of greed. This has to make it clear, right? This is how they're going to understand.
00:03:10.414 - 00:03:44.630, Speaker A: No? Half a million views later, all of the messages, all of the retweets, the crazy engagement. These people now think I'm launching a token. I wake up the next day, by the way, with like 500 new followers, which was quite huge. I had only 2500 followers before this happens by the end of that day. And now I'm thinking, how do we now, how do I play this out now saying, haha, I was joking is even worse than this morning. I'm digging my own hole pretty much. This is not going great.
00:03:44.630 - 00:04:14.794, Speaker A: This is not going the way I planned. How do we teach people something from this? And some ideas start going through my mind and I find like a solution. I think at that point how we can make this good. Of course I'm a bit afraid it's going to end up even worse, but let's try it out. I found two developers that managed to deliver a smart contract for this in two days. So on few days pass, this is going crazier. I'm somehow getting 30,000 more followers in the next four days.
00:04:14.794 - 00:04:41.474, Speaker A: But I want to make sure that I make people who are going to participate in this really go through summer hoops. So even the day before, I say, now you need to quote, retweet and say, my greed is endless. I think this one ended with like 700,000 views. The engagement. Like 30,000 people retweeted this. It was. Anyway, that day.
00:04:41.474 - 00:04:58.454, Speaker A: We tell them, okay, now it's time to go claim your greed. We make a website. The guys show me the website that they prepared. I'm like, can we make this look more shady? I want this to be clearly shady. I'm going to buy the domain. We bought domain. Greedconsumes me.
00:04:58.454 - 00:05:20.014, Speaker A: I'm like, this font is too nice. Space this out a bit. Like, there you go. Sign in with Twitter. Connect your wallet, claim of tokens. That's it, right? But when they go to connect their twitters, they get asked for full write permissions on their Twitter account. So if they allow us these permissions, we can do whatever we want with their Twitter.
00:05:20.014 - 00:05:57.886, Speaker A: The second they click it, we can delete all of their Twitter history, do whatever we want after they accept, and only if they accept, they can connect their wallets, claim their greed. When they do claim their greed, the wallet simulation fails. So if we wanted to drain every wallet that signed these transactions, we could have, they had no idea what they were signing. And now you're thinking, how many people decided to go through all of this before that? Step four. We tell them to share this on Twitter. When they click that, we prepare a nice message. I'm so happy to be a part of the grid experiment.
00:05:57.886 - 00:06:28.394, Speaker A: Good luck, Washi. 35,000 people that they posted this tweet. Now, before I go into the numbers, I want to make sure to show you that during those, the whole thing lasted five to six days. Right? Five days since the first tweet. Until we say, this is now open. I was making sure to post only the things that are showing to people that they should really, really not do this. So soft money tweets, like, be aware of greed just because your friends are jumping into something you shouldn't.
00:06:28.394 - 00:07:14.764, Speaker A: I retweet that the only utility of shitcoins is making the founder rich. I retweet that I even write the cheat sheet for the shitcoin season. And I say, if you are not the founder, if you are not the bot, don't. Now, when we posted that website, when the people started signing it, people started coming angry on Twitter. Why are we asking for all of these permissions? Like, are you for real? Do you understand security concerns? I'm like, I do. Does everybody else? Are you serious? This is shady as hell. What's your response? My response is, are you greedy enough to do it? These perms are a little excessive, don't you think? I do.
00:07:14.764 - 00:07:47.054, Speaker A: That sounds great. By the end of the claim period, which lasted 24 hours, 55,311 Solana tokens had greed in them. We are the 35th like top 35 coin by distribution on Solana. Great success. All of those tokens are frozen. Of course. In their accounts, there is an exact number of tokens, pretty specific that we're going to go into a bit later that each of these 55,000 holders has.
00:07:47.054 - 00:08:20.754, Speaker A: After the claim period ends, I tweet, the claim period is now over. And it would be great if the subjects let us know how they feel about it, and we press play. We press play on posting the manifesto from 1600 Twitter accounts. That's the number that Elon allows us to do with the API. We couldn't do more than that without paying $40,000. That's another story. And we press play and the twitter goes crazy.
00:08:20.754 - 00:08:57.584, Speaker A: One six K accounts tweets the same thing some of the big names in the ecosystem do. The funniest, of course, being slope. You could just imagine somebody from slope, like after eight months going, I'm going to make it all back in one train and just go. We changed the website to step five, where your badge of honor explained that we could only push to some accounts. So please, the rest of subjects, do it yourself. I think there's always 20,000 people who even clicked this and tweeted it without reading it. It's crazy.
00:08:57.584 - 00:09:37.192, Speaker A: So some numbers from that day, over 300,000 page views in only two days. This is actually the chart of active addresses on Solana compared to bitcoin, Ethereum and polygon. During that day. You can see the spike. And then the same data analytics site decided to scrap interactions with the green smart contract the next day because it was a clear outlier. Those are the most used smart contracts on Solana down there, and that's greed. So some numbers on Twitter.
00:09:37.192 - 00:10:11.784, Speaker A: This was my very proud next morning after the first tweet screenshot, look, I have 3000 followers now. Amazing. Ended at 33,004 days later. The engagement numbers were just simply crazy on some of the tweets. I had 5 million impressions during those six days. Greed was trending on Twitter and I had like a lot of messages saying that it was the top at one point with over 1 million tweets mentioning it in 24 hours. And I became the second on NFT inspect on global reach.
00:10:11.784 - 00:10:45.354, Speaker A: Thank you. After the whole thing happened, media outlets started reaching out and everybody covered that. We have coindesk, Coinmarketcap, binance. Like, everybody wrote about it. Even some local newspapers that they never heard of from Croatia started sending me DM's like, can we interview? I'm like, this feels weird. Please, no. So remember that exact number of tokens that we put in everybody's wallets and it's frozen in there forever.
00:10:45.354 - 00:11:19.576, Speaker A: Well, whoever googles that number, they can find. That's actually the hotline for the SEC. That's the number that you can call if you need investment advice. These people can never burn these tokens from their wallets. They can never remove them. This is one of the only Solana tokens with real utility. Like, they have some of the funny things that happened during the period before we opened the claims I can say that I onboarded a lot of people on Solana.
00:11:19.576 - 00:12:04.142, Speaker A: Friends start sending me messages like, I have eat friends, they never touch Solana. They are asking me about this greed thing I gave them. Like, I showed them how to set up a wallet. We even had some AdA users or the AdA users, I'm not sure. Also, I had altogether in that week, over 400 messages asking me about pre sale. And this is like the first, I think, important lesson for everybody. I think almost nobody asked, what does the token do? What's the supply? People were just like, how much can I put in? And I think that's a big lesson about how just listening to the hype around you makes us all kind of sometimes feel we are sure about something.
00:12:04.142 - 00:12:32.686, Speaker A: We definitely need to learn how to do some more research and approach things a bit more seriously. Some funny messages. After that, people don't read. And it's crazy. Examples like this were like all over the place. Somebody tweets it and then gets surprised about how this happened because he didn't even read the tweet that was tweeted through this account and he's still surprised no one read this shit. Three clown emojis.
00:12:32.686 - 00:13:04.100, Speaker A: Clearly I'm the clown who reads all this. Is he actually launching or no? Like, if there was only, if there was only a way to find out, I don't know. Is it safe to revoke? Is another story. So people were kind of smart and then tweeting, like, just go collect, read, then revoke. And we're like, that's stupid advice. Because if we were malicious, we could hurt you the second you connect. But then we topped it up the day before and said like, whoever revoked, if they don't give back the permissions, they are never going to get their tokens unfrozen.
00:13:04.100 - 00:14:00.534, Speaker A: So people rushed back and gave them permissions and this guy tweets this thing and then still goes, is it now safe to revoke? Then there was a lot of angry people that apparently expected to get something way more out of this. Some people with telling me I'm just choking my own ego. Some long messages explaining to me how I'm clearly a rich american dude and why couldn't I make the poor dudes rich or just simple DM's with a simple fu. Now going into conclusions, I think privacy and security is quite clear. People were giving out the whole twitter accounts for this. We need to be aware where we are giving out our privacy, security, signing transactions that could have been anything, like connecting to unknown sites. But I think the biggest lesson here was how the hype can go crazy.
00:14:00.534 - 00:14:27.234, Speaker A: I had people who are my friends coming to tell me. I didn't know this was you. I just heard about greed from the few groups. I clicked the link in some of the groups connecting there like they had no idea and it showed me that we really need to do better with understanding what we're investing, what we are throwing our money into. I was sure that a lot of people are going to forget this in two days. A few months later, I was so happy. Friend tech came out.
00:14:27.234 - 00:15:05.538, Speaker A: They were asking for write permissions and I got tagged dozens of times per day saying like, did Voshi teach us nothing? I was so happy because it seems like some people really remembered it. And I did get over 150 DM's afterwards telling me that they changed the way they approach things. There is an educational initiative that we thought of about how we can make these kind of people want to learn more. We are in context currently with some people from the foundation. We're trying to make it happen and I think it could be cool. So follow for more on that. And as I promised, the airdrop.
00:15:05.538 - 00:15:32.518, Speaker A: Yay. Another NFT. I'm not going to drain your wallets just because we couldn't find a way to fix a simulation, but it's actually just a screenshot of the slope tweet that you can all collect. So please scan this now or I'll go back to that after my outro because my time is out. Thank you so much for listening. Please follow me. I did like 7000 angry people didn't follow me after the whole thing.
00:15:32.518 - 00:16:04.586, Speaker A: So please let's make it all back in one trade. And please follow blast control, which is my agency, and if you have any questions, if we can help your project reach out. Also, tokenomics is something we do, so if your project does actually want to launch a token, let's at least try to do it right. And there are my guys in red shirt. If you have any questions there and I have no time for Q and a, but I'm going to stick around. So if anybody has any more questions, please find me. I'm happy to answer them.
00:16:04.586 - 00:16:08.354, Speaker A: The NFT is back. It's really not the rug. Thank you so much guys.
