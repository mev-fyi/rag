00:00:03.600 - 00:00:27.614, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. All right? We're just waiting for a bit until our presentation comes up. Thank you very much for listening to us today. We're Adam and Sylvie and, yeah, we're super stoked to be here today. Wow, our presentation is up. So, yeah, this morning we didn't have actually, or this night we didn't have the best night. We slept quite badly in our hostel room.
00:00:27.614 - 00:01:10.166, Speaker A: So first things first, we said, ok, we need to go get great coffee. We would actually love to pay for the coffee with Solana pay, but unfortunately, outside of breakpoint in Amsterdam, there's not really a place yet where you can pay with it. But don't lose hope yet. There is bitcoin lightning, and a lot of places already accept bitcoin lightning for payments. So we were just like, bitcoin Lightning is basically a L2 on top of bitcoin that makes payments instantly. So we were just like, what if there would be a way to hijack bitcoin Lightning to actually pay with Solana pay? Well, there is. It is solightning.
00:01:10.166 - 00:01:52.086, Speaker A: It is the first fully trustless cross chain Dex between bitcoin and Solana that can be used for either payments or swaps. So we went on to btcmap.org, which is a website where you can find all the places where you can pay in bitcoin. And we found a cafe, Melly's cookie bar, which was actually just a five minute walk from our hotel room. And we went there and now let's go there and let's check it out. So, yeah, we were on our life saving quest to get coffee equipped with sew lightning in our pockets. Entering the coffee shop, really stoked to finally, hopefully, wake up from the caffeine shock.
00:01:52.086 - 00:02:34.358, Speaker A: And, yeah, the owner, Daniel, was super nice. It was a very seamless experience, super quick. We just got out our phantom wallet, opened the Sol lightning dapp, we scanned the QR code that Daniel showed to us, we paid with Sol, we fetched the quote, which took a few seconds, and then, yeah, we saw the fees that we have to pay the total in Sol. We hit pay, we hit confirm. So, overall, very seamless experience, very quick. And, yeah, successful payment. So, yeah, finally, mission pay for our coffee with Solanapay in Amsterdam.
00:02:34.358 - 00:02:48.234, Speaker A: Accomplished. So, as you just saw, payments with solightning are super seamless and quick. But solightning has more in store for you. And I'm now handing over to my co founder, Adam, who will tell you what exactly.
00:02:48.694 - 00:03:34.028, Speaker B: Thank you, Silvi. So, Sylvie already presented the payment use case. What you can also do with solightning is trustless cross chain swaps between bitcoin and Solana. On the bitcoin side, we actually support both bitcoin lightning, which is good for lower value swaps, and it's very fast. On the other hand, we have also the on chain, which is good for higher value trades. And yeah, I probably don't need to explain to you why we need trustless solutions to do swaps after all that happened with the likes of FTX and similar centralized solutions. So let me give you a demo how I can trustlessly swap between solana and bitcoin.
00:03:34.028 - 00:04:21.170, Speaker B: So what we will do first, so we have our dapp here. It's pretty much like a uniswap like interface. What we will do first is turn some solana into bitcoin. So I have my bitcoin wallet here, I copy the address, paste it here, and I will do just the lowest possible value to pay. So here I get the fee, the quote for the pricing. Now I can hit swap, confirm the transaction in my phantom wallet, and after a short moment, the bitcoin transaction gets sent. And I actually was able to swap my solana into bitcoin.
00:04:21.170 - 00:04:48.374, Speaker B: Yeah, right there. And you can see it in my wallet right here. It's unconfirmed, but it is there. So the next thing we can do is actually go the other way around. So we can swap from bitcoin into solana. So I will do that right now. I will open like a gateway where I can send my bitcoin here.
00:04:48.374 - 00:05:22.854, Speaker B: I go to my bitcoin wallet, go to send, paste the address, type in the amount. Yep, like this. And hit pay. Okay. My password in broadcasting. Okay, so now the transaction was sent, and we see here that now it is waiting for confirmations. And once it gets two confirmations, the trade will actually be settled.
00:05:22.854 - 00:06:11.080, Speaker B: And I will get my soul. This on bitcoin takes a long time, so about 20 minutes. If you want to see it completed and confirmed, we can show you after the presentation. Okay, so now back to the presentation and more. On a technical note, you might be wondering, how does solitude work? So, first thing that's important to note is that we don't use any multisig of honest majority to do these swaps. Even though you rely on a singular liquidity provider node for your swap, the swap is fully trustless and it's secured actually by the bitcoin's proof of work and atomic swaps for lightning. So first thing you have to do is select the liquidity provider node that you want to use.
00:06:11.080 - 00:07:02.056, Speaker B: This is based on its fees, reputation and liquidity. Then to initiate the swap you lock up your sol or other SPL token in a smart contract vault on Solana. Liquidity provider node then observes the creation of this smart contract vault and verifies it. And then the liquidity provider node pays out the recipient wallet in bitcoin. Now imagine we could have this black box that can trustlessly verify on Solana that the bitcoin transaction really took place and was confirmed. We can use that black box or liquidity provider can use that black box to trustlessly prove to the smart contract world that he really sent a bitcoin transaction and claim the soul. How does this black box work? So for bitcoin on chain we use bitcoin lite client implemented inside the Solana program.
00:07:02.056 - 00:07:28.044, Speaker B: And for bitcoin light network we use submarine swaps which work very similar to atomic swaps. So what are you waiting for? Try lighting for yourself right here in Amsterdam. Go to btcmap.org, find a place that accepts bitcoin, there are quite a few of them and then go there equipped with our Dapp that is at app dot solbtc.org and pay there with Solana. Thank you.
