00:00:00.800 - 00:00:53.172, Speaker A: All right, thanks, everybody, for being here today. Thrilled to talk about the browser wars and crypto wallets. And to do that joined by our esteemed panel, Brian Friel, developer relations at Fantom with the cheering section, Philip Dragoslavic, co founder of Soulflare, Max von Wallenberg, CEO of Ultimate, and Victor Pontus, founder of Glow. Thanks for joining us, guys. So like I said, we're going to talk about the browser wars of the late nineties and early two thousands and how that kind of pertains to crypto wallets today. From a lot of the faces that I see here in the crowd and those that I've met around Lisbon, I can tell not many of you remember the browser wars of the mid nineties. So that was a time when Netscape navigator was really battling with Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
00:00:53.172 - 00:01:25.894, Speaker A: We were all using dial up, we were paying a gazillion dollars per minute to get onto the Internet. And Bill Gates and Microsoft ultimately won that war. But there was an antitrust lawsuit, which they lost, then settled. And right about that time there was this little company called Google that was getting into the mix. So what we're really talking about here is market dominance. So very broadly, these were the ogs of Web two, but now we're all going to talk about Web three. That's why we're all here today.
00:01:25.894 - 00:01:39.910, Speaker A: So I wanted to ask all of you, as you do your business with crypto wallets, how do you see kind of some of the lessons that we took from that era and how does it pertain to wallets in Web three today? Brian, why don't we start with you?
00:01:39.982 - 00:02:05.464, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm happy to start. I think the big thing when we're looking Web two versus web3 is that that layer of ownership and what that really means is the end users feel connected to something digitally. Usually it's nfts. They want to be connected to that, be part of that community, and the wallet is how they experience that. And it goes the same way for wallets too. They want to feel connected to their wallet. Just yesterday there was the ute's mint and we saw so many people showcasing Fantom and how they minted with Fantom.
00:02:05.464 - 00:02:26.698, Speaker B: There's a lot of differences between a browser and a wallet in that case. And so I think some lessons learned that maybe we could apply to crypto wallets is the browsers that really took off. Netscape and then eventually Internet Explorer and Chrome all made a step function change in the user experience, making things really safe and easy to use. And so that's what we want to focus on at Fantom.
00:02:26.786 - 00:02:31.026, Speaker A: Yeah, Max, I saw you nodding. What are your thoughts on this, Max?
00:02:31.050 - 00:03:08.560, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the huge difference is that the ownership of data is very different in the wallet space because you can use multiple wallets at the same time and people do. Right. I think the average person uses a couple of wallets, maybe for different purposes, and I think also that's where the market will go. Like, people will pick and choose wallets for their specific use cases. That's actually very different. Comparing that to the browser wars, where really it was all about ownership of information. If you look at Google Chrome today, people work in Chrome and they have profiles tied to it, password managers, everything is deeply integrated and they don't want you to switch across because information is money, right.
00:03:08.560 - 00:03:12.324, Speaker C: And data is money, and that's very different in web3, in the wallets.
00:03:13.304 - 00:04:06.170, Speaker D: Philip, I can basically just add to Victor's point that it's not quite comparable, like the browser wars with the wallet words, just because what he has done and browsers were here actually to, he needed access to the Internet, basically. He had one main function, wallets, and we're going to get to that a little bit later on, have a whole set of functions, what the user can do with it and everything else. So as Max actually says, wallets will eventually have different features, different functions. And the beauty of web3 is actually that there's basically zero to low switching costs. So I can take my seed phrase, I can put it in another wallet, and I'm all set up to use another wallet with its different capabilities. So I think.
00:04:06.322 - 00:04:07.258, Speaker A: Victor, what's your take?
00:04:07.306 - 00:04:34.604, Speaker E: Victor, I think the biggest change is really, like, the browsers were so useful. Like, you would open a browser to do so many different things. Like when the Internet came out, it was like, sick, right? It's like, oh, like, there's so many search engines, you're opening them up to do things. It's like more information than you could ever imagine online. And it's still super addicting. Like, Wikipedia is addicting for me. I just go on it and it's like, learn everything.
00:04:34.604 - 00:05:16.894, Speaker E: And the wallets are right now augmenting apps, I think no wallet, really? Oh, I need to open it every day. It's like, okay, you don't open your bank account every day, you don't open financial products every day unless you're actively trading, which I think is a small amount of people. I think what crypto needs is more things that you need to open every day and more use cases. So that's what we're trying to build is around, hey, how do we have a better social experience, a better use case? And I think that's where wallets will. It's not war over the same amount of users who are opening some other dapp. It's like, how do you fit in in this new ecosystem? And what do you let users do? They can't do otherwise.
00:05:17.004 - 00:05:35.374, Speaker A: Yeah, so that actually brings me to my next point and question. What do you all see as the actual role of the wallet in the crypto ecosystem? Because there seems to be a lot of room for all of you to kind of make a play right now and make those decisions for the future.
00:05:36.674 - 00:06:15.502, Speaker D: I can go first. Well, I think wallets are basically this first layer of trust between the user and the blockchain itself. Because they're storing their assets, they're basically entering the web3 space for it. So it's basically a gateway to the decentralized Internet of that sort. So we're now currently just in that phase where we're mostly just, I mean, storing assets and letting users, allowing users to actually interact with dapps. But I think that wallets in the future will do more and more stuff. They will eventually evolve into super app.
00:06:15.502 - 00:06:35.154, Speaker D: Why? Because users already trust them. So you already trusted wallets. You are going to trust them more if they will just allow you to do a certain type of action compared to you going to different sites that you don't know. And that's basically.
00:06:35.714 - 00:06:37.026, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:06:37.050 - 00:07:06.566, Speaker C: I would actually say that wallets today don't actually do the job that they should be doing. I mean, I know it's a bit controversial because, right. If I give someone a wallet, you know, browser extension, you install it, it's basically empty. Right? Like, they don't do any good job of onboarding people into discovering things to do. Like, and then, you know, if you have some tokens in there, there's sort of an asset snapshot. So what we're really trying to do with ultimate is to, you know, make the entire experience before, you know, you. You buy a token afterwards when you see how much is actually worth.
00:07:06.566 - 00:07:30.634, Speaker C: What's my p and l data feeds? Everything that you actually need to make an informed decision. What you want to do in web3, that should be part of the wallet experience, and it's not today. And we really feel that's the next generation of web wallets will go, will make it so much easier in terms of just onboarding users into web3 and then kind of holding their hands almost like a companion all along the way.
00:07:31.694 - 00:08:05.582, Speaker B: Yeah, I just want to say I think a lot of the space inherited the patterns that metamask set because it was the original wallet. And a lot of people just thought, oh, this is a means to an end for me to actually use the dapps. I think we're just scratching the surface on wallets. Can do. I kind of view wallets as your digital friend to exploring the digital economy. I'm really proud of what we did with lists on magic Eden and connecting your wallet to Instagram and showing all your nfts, and we just launched explorers. And I think bringing the user into the digital world, showing them how they can interact with all this very safely in a social way, that's what wallets are for.
00:08:05.718 - 00:08:06.574, Speaker A: Victor? Victor.
00:08:06.614 - 00:08:34.032, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's. There are different roles, different wallets will go down. One is, I think more apps in crypto will have a wallet built in. I think one of the biggest wallets on Solana is stepn. And it's like people don't have a secret phrase that they're writing down. It's not about porting things over. It's a game that has a crypto element to it, and crypto is just part of it.
00:08:34.032 - 00:09:18.722, Speaker E: It's not like, hey, I have my step in wallet that I'm using in other places. So you'll see apps that have wallets. But I think also with one thing we're really interested in is around the opposite of the anonymity that everyone talks about in crypto, where it's actually, how do you prove you are who you are? How do you claim badges? How do you earn certificates? How do you prove you're a human? With all the crazy stuff happening in AI right now, it's like there's going to be a million LinkedIn profiles that are fake for every real person. Every chat will have tons of bots in it. And so crypto provides a really interesting opportunity to verify you are, who you are if you build the right systems. So I think that'll be one direction of a wallet being a portal.
00:09:18.858 - 00:09:21.334, Speaker A: Do you think the crypto community will accept that?
00:09:22.154 - 00:09:56.488, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think the crypto community will. For crypto to go mainstream and for more people to use it, I think it will be less anonymous over time. I don't think most people want to be anonymous online. I think people like interacting with their friends and people they know. And it takes a lot longer to build up a relationship with an anonymous person than somebody with a persistent identity. Maybe they would choose a different name online. Like, people already do that, but it's not like wallet address five and wallet address six.
00:09:56.488 - 00:10:10.900, Speaker E: So related to that, we made our launched Glow ID, which is our own identity system that you can build on top of also. But that's in invite only now and we're rolling that out. But I think it's not around the anonymity.
00:10:11.092 - 00:10:36.458, Speaker D: But when you said crypto community, the crypto community now is maybe a little bit more steering towards the anonymous direction. But as we. As the market grows bigger, as more and more people get in, I think that more KYC solutions or soul bound token solutions will take a more important role, and wallets in general.
00:10:36.626 - 00:10:59.042, Speaker A: So right now, if we want to compare to browsers, Google is the ultimate in that space. Do you think if you look out just a little bit into the future, that there will be one wallet to rule them all, or will there be niche products that have a utility? I mean, you all are kind of. Yes, go ahead.
00:10:59.098 - 00:11:20.602, Speaker B: I just want to say, I think we're very, very early right now. We're at millions of users. We need to grow this to billions of users. I talked about people feeling connected to their wallets. There's going to be a lot of different ways that people want to express themselves digitally. There's room for a lot of different players. We're very, very focused on providing the cleanest, simplest, safest experience at scale.
00:11:20.602 - 00:11:27.134, Speaker B: But we love seeing all the experimentation. We think it's awesome. There's definitely tons of room for players.
00:11:28.714 - 00:12:28.484, Speaker D: It depends. So it depends on how many blockchains will actually be relevant and five to ten years from now. So ultimately, what we believe is that there will be like some sort of big multi chain wallet that will just do, like, the basic functions like send and receive tokens, potentially send and receive nfts, swap, and that's it. Because if you want to implement many different blockchains, their blockchains are fundamentally different. You need to dump down the flows and basically you get a really featured poor wallet, but you get a wallet that has actually access to all the blockchains. But then on top of this big, basically base multichain wallet, you'll have blockchain specific deep wallets. So you, for example, have a Solana wallet ETH wallet that basically can unlock 100% of the blockchain's potential and do more stuff with it.
00:12:28.524 - 00:12:42.404, Speaker E: So you think there'll be multiple, many different chains? You mentioned that, yes. Yeah, I think there'll be, like, hopefully one or two. Like, I think bitcoin will still exist, I think, like, like if ethereum.
00:12:42.444 - 00:12:45.476, Speaker D: How we niche out. Sorry, it depends on how we niche out.
00:12:45.540 - 00:12:45.740, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:12:45.772 - 00:13:00.856, Speaker D: So if all the blockchains do just one specific use case, then okay, then I'm with you in one to two chains. But if one is going to more of, I don't know, game direction, one is doing nfts, one is for one specific verticals, then I think we're going to have more.
00:13:01.000 - 00:13:03.124, Speaker E: Yeah. Which one is Solana going to be?
00:13:03.584 - 00:13:05.432, Speaker D: That's the million dollar question.
00:13:05.608 - 00:13:06.736, Speaker E: Million dollars.
00:13:06.920 - 00:13:15.936, Speaker D: I mean, Solana billion dollar, trillion. So Solana in the beginning said, they always said they want to be the Nasdaq on chain. So defi.
00:13:15.960 - 00:13:16.792, Speaker C: Defi, defi, yeah.
00:13:16.888 - 00:13:26.526, Speaker D: And then nfts happens basically. And now Solana is basically predominantly like an NFT chain for now.
00:13:26.710 - 00:13:49.754, Speaker C: But nfts are a form of defi. Right. So I mean, like, our take here is that, like, especially when it comes to financial services, you need like a very purpose built wallet for it. Because financial services are very specific thing. Like, you know, money investments are a really important thing to people, very personal. And like, you don't want, I don't think you can actually marry like, like a general purpose wallet with the needs and wants of an investor. Right.
00:13:49.754 - 00:14:15.494, Speaker C: Like if I want to see portfolio history, data, candlestick charts, like all of this stuff, you know, not everyone needs, but like, if you're serious about investing and defi, like, you really want that from a wallet. So we feel that the wallets of the future will be, will have a very specific focus area and there might be some general purpose built ones, but, you know, especially on the financial services side, you need this focus that also.
00:14:15.534 - 00:14:27.246, Speaker D: Depends on the market. So if you have 500k people in the ecosystem or 500 million people in the ecosystem, it's a whole different ballgame, basically. So all depends on that.
00:14:27.390 - 00:15:20.676, Speaker E: Going back to the question around the winner take all, I think it's like another way you could think about crypto is as a technology. And if you think about it as a technology like postgres or Ach, it's like, like, ok, postgres is like Oracle came out with a database and everyone has their own database, and it's like, ok, is there going to be a winner take all database app? And it's like, ok, no. Every app is using the database and every app is reading and writing to it. I think crypto needs to become more a technology that a lot of other apps are using and that's how it'll be useful. So there will be like winners in different use cases. If you're building some social app that maybe has, like, signing in it, right. And it doesn't need any of the financial stuff, it's just like verifying you are who you are.
00:15:20.676 - 00:15:34.598, Speaker E: And it's doing all that signing with crypto, and it's putting messages on chain that can have a network effect and be a winner. But it's not even related to anything that this, like, finance part of crypto, like crypto doesn't have to be about money.
00:15:34.726 - 00:15:36.342, Speaker A: Yeah, Brian, I was just going to.
00:15:36.358 - 00:16:01.552, Speaker B: Say, I think all of this discussion shows that we're early. There's a lot of different ways this could play out, and I think we want to position ourselves to be amenable to that. Just the fact that anyone can butt anything permissionlessly. Three, five years ago, NFTs were. No one thought NFTs were going to be a thing in 2018. Everyone thought DeFi was going to be a big thing. I've been very humbled in crypto before.
00:16:01.552 - 00:16:05.844, Speaker B: Had my mind changed. I look forward to that happening again, and we want to be there for it.
00:16:06.144 - 00:16:08.604, Speaker A: So, changing gears a little bit.
00:16:10.504 - 00:16:10.864, Speaker E: The.
00:16:10.904 - 00:16:31.764, Speaker A: US government got involved in Microsoft, they got involved with Google. Do you foresee any, I don't know, legal challenges or just regulation? If we get some regulatory clarity in the coming months year, how do you think that will impact the wallet race?
00:16:32.824 - 00:17:18.778, Speaker E: I think the biggest regulators in this space are the mobile platforms. I think everyone has had submitted apps, or anyone who's built an app in crypto has submitted it and been nervous about different reviews. And I think we talked a little bit about the super app, where that's something that's explicitly, explicitly not allowed on either the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. So it's like these platforms have more power than the governments right now in terms of what people are building in crypto. So that's where I think will be interesting is how these platforms play out. And if they incorporate crypto themselves, how.
00:17:18.786 - 00:17:21.414, Speaker A: Do you think that's going to play out? Philip?
00:17:23.634 - 00:18:05.962, Speaker D: I also agree with Victor that the biggest threat is basically Apple and Android. They just release a wallet. That's basically. And this gets super interesting for us because we again need to niche out and do maybe stuff differently than them in terms of these antitrust allegations or whatever it was in the browser wars. It's hard. I don't know what basically would be the analogy in the crypto space. So is it potentially the blockchain itself that says, I don't know?
00:18:06.058 - 00:18:27.790, Speaker E: Yeah, it's kind of like if so Microsoft released Internet Explorer and they bundled it and it was like the default. So it's like if Apple releases their own crypto wallet and then that's the default and they block all crypto apps, is that antitrust? And I think that could be an interesting place where the antitrust specific thing, it matches the browser words pretty similarly.
00:18:27.902 - 00:18:52.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think that users are going to demand that their digital life works seamlessly across everything, across their desktop computers, their phones, gaming environments as well. So I agree. I think everyone who's built an app has thought about this kind of the forces that be, but I'm optimistic that users are going to demand something that what they want.
00:18:52.194 - 00:19:31.014, Speaker A: So one of the things that I think we try to do over and over again is take things that are happening now, or maybe web two experiences and overlay them on crypto or web3 and try to make it work, to try to make sense of it, especially as crypto goes more mainstream. Are there any lessons that you all take from kind of the nineties and two thousands that you think actually are fairly applicable or are similar enough where you're like, okay, we either are going to go down this road or really stay away.
00:19:31.834 - 00:20:06.724, Speaker B: I'm happy to go. I mentioned we first started about the UX lessons and how that's been a big focus for us, making it so easy. A kindergartner can use this. I think another lesson, though is not just consumers, but also developers. If you're a web developer, you know how hard, you know, when you say the word Internet Explorer, you have like a visceral reaction to that. And so that's been a big focus for us too, is how do we empower devs to, you know, best reach their users, create the kind of apps they want to do. Mobile wallet adapters live now, if you have an Android phone, you can interact with Phantom directly from Chrome.
00:20:06.724 - 00:20:09.876, Speaker B: We'll keep investing in developers like that.
00:20:10.020 - 00:21:00.624, Speaker C: Yeah, I think also, if you look at the market share, Internet Explorer was basically think they can't lose. I mean, they came obviously bundled, but they were obviously disintermediated, as we all saw. So I think that's also a case even more so in crypto, where even if you have substantial market share as a wallet, you can't rest on these laurels. Someone else might do it better and someone else might actually, you know, just by virtue of you being able to port over your wallet from someone else, you know, just basically switch, the switching cost is nearly zero. Right. So this is something which all of us here on this panel will keep us on our toes, right, to always develop really good product because we all know the user is literally just kind of a click away because they might have actually three or four wallets installed. So I think overall, this complete data portability will actually make it, you know, bring about better products and more innovation faster.
00:21:03.084 - 00:21:57.184, Speaker D: I mean, I agree with Max. It's a hyper competitive space, basically. So in a web two world, I mean, you have your siloed basically, companies, and it's super hard to move your data, your profiles, whatever you have to somewhere else. But in crypto, it's super easy. That makes our job a lot harder because as soon as someone brings out a new feature that is, I don't know, liked by the whole market, and we need to get it out there as soon as possible to just catch up and be there. So I think that it's ultimately great for the end consumer because we're basically fighting to give them, like, the best possible experience. But this also accelerates our development and our basically go to market basically with the product a lot faster than any web two company would do because, yeah.
00:21:57.264 - 00:22:33.042, Speaker E: Victor, thinking about the early Internet and the browser wars are more web one, I guess. I think a couple big shifts were Amazon got you to pay for things online. Before Amazon, I remember my mom was like, oh, don't put in the card online. Like, if you put in your credit card online, what could happen? We're going to lose the house and we're going to be sleeping on the streets. But Amazon normalized, hey, you can pay for things online. It's safe. You actually get the thing.
00:22:33.042 - 00:23:22.914, Speaker E: You can get your money back if it doesn't come. And then the other shift was around putting your personal information online. And I think LinkedIn and Facebook both did this, where it's before these companies, it was like everyone was on a forum where you create your own name and you obviously don't have your photo, and there's probably creepy people online who are going to kidnap you or something. And now we take it for granted that, yeah, I'll buy stuff mostly online with my credit card, and then I sign up for stuff and before I would log in with Facebook or have my actual identity. So I think crypto needs to bring both of those where it's like, yeah, you want to bring in your identity and where people can see who you are. And one thing we worked on with Glow ID is you type in someone's name and you can send to them. It's really easy.
00:23:22.914 - 00:23:56.376, Speaker E: You want to know who you're sending to, and the financial trust is really hard. How do you get people to trust this ecosystem and say, hey, I feel comfortable putting money and sending to my friends and managing funds here where we can vote on it together and do something like a dao, where right now we're in the period of all these hacks and speculation, where it feels like a place where you can make money but not a secure store of value right now. And we need to get there on the topical facts.
00:23:56.440 - 00:24:39.238, Speaker C: I think one part of actually role of the wallet is also consumer protection. So if you look at things that actually sit between the wallet and the protocols, you know, the kind of firewalls, if you will, like. So, you know, I think the wallet needs to do a much better job in terms of embracing openness and composability, but at the same time also, you know, being an effective filter to show you things as a consumer that are what you're looking for in terms of risk reward on the defi side, in terms of, you know, the right collections on the NFT side. And I think this is something, there's a lot of things that are being developed that will make this a much, much better and more trustworthy process. And yeah, that's a core functionality of what is going forward.
00:24:39.366 - 00:24:41.566, Speaker D: Yeah, I just need to educate people.
00:24:41.630 - 00:24:47.134, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, sorry, I was just really quick. Couldn't agree more. If you missed Brandon's talk, it's an hour before he talks all about this.
00:24:47.214 - 00:24:50.934, Speaker D: But please, Philip, you can.
00:24:51.094 - 00:25:10.914, Speaker B: Oh, that's it. I mean, it's multileveled. It's like this permissionless, great nature of the ecosystem. And the wallet really is the first line of defense. How do you alert users when things potentially go wrong? And then also, if you're there and you even think this is a trusted app, the programs can change. And how can you on the fly recognize that? So it's a huge responsibility.
00:25:11.574 - 00:25:48.404, Speaker D: It's a huge responsibility. But we also need to educate the users about web, three specific things, because we can't just abstract all out all of it. So some things need to be thought to the user in a very engaging way because it's basically a new paradigm shift. So for the first time in many years, basically you're the owner of your assets. Nobody else can take them away from you. But it's also a huge responsibility. And that's one of the things that we need to teach users, that they're basically in control.
00:25:49.454 - 00:26:04.230, Speaker A: So we've only got a few minutes left. I wanted to ask all of you in 2025. When we're all back here at Breakpoint, what are we going to be talking about as it pertains to wallets? Bring out the crystal ball. Who wants to go first?
00:26:04.342 - 00:26:48.018, Speaker B: I can start by sharing. Vibhu of Solana Spaces has this great quote where he says that every single brand that ten years from now will all be deeply digital. And they likely have all started in a crypto context, using NFTs to reach their users. And I agree with that. You see very early signs of this now, but basically facilitating that connection of users and what they love digitally, what they own, connecting, it's very social as well, how that actually manifests in implementation details. I talked about how none of us could have even seen this NFT craze coming. I'll hold off on the implementation details for now, but that's what we're really excited about, just making that a fun, safe, intuitive experience for everybody.
00:26:48.106 - 00:26:49.786, Speaker A: Yeah. Philip.
00:26:49.930 - 00:27:47.356, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, we're going to see, like, a lot of innovation in this space. I think that more and more, as Brian said, cross collaborations between web two companies and web3 companies will take place. So, like, token gated communities. Like, there's a bunch of stuff that basically can do. But I'm also thinking that coming back to one of the first questions that we had is that KYC and proof of, basically, identity will also be, like, a big place because you want to be able to, I don't know, pay for stuff online with crypto, and most of the time, the merchant needs to know who that is in order to basically facilitate the purchase and. Yeah, so I think that we're going more and more mainstream with the whole idea of wallets.
00:27:47.540 - 00:27:48.284, Speaker A: Max.
00:27:48.444 - 00:28:29.474, Speaker C: Yeah, I really hope that we don't sit here and talk about, like, how kind of web two and centralized players won the wallet game in the sense that, like, the wallets became this invisible layer. So I kind of, you know, every company that is big out there right now, like, has sort of their own wallet, and you don't even know that you're interacting with crypto anymore. I do think we should really fully embrace crypto, and actually, I hope we sit here as crypto native wallets, and from our side, I really hope that we become that Defi super app. Where would you go to and invest into Defi? We don't want that race to be won by centralized brokers.
00:28:30.454 - 00:28:31.246, Speaker A: Victor.
00:28:31.390 - 00:29:30.990, Speaker E: Yeah. I don't think there'll be a wallet panel or I hope there's not. I think we're trying to build social identity and social features and where you get your glow id. You verify your Twitter, you can earn badges for achieving different things. We're launching with badges mostly in the crypto ecosystem, but we're working on how do you get badges for winning a marathon or doing other things? Being one year at stripe, you get a badge, and that's a better badge than putting stripe on your LinkedIn. How do you verify you are who you are? And then how do you join communities that you're interested in and find events and find other people who you want to work with or learn from? And the wallet is like, if you look at wallets today, they're like a wrapper around this sign message function. And they store your keys, and it's like, well, they don't really store your keys.
00:29:30.990 - 00:30:02.498, Speaker E: Most wallets actually say, oh, you have to store your own keys, and you're given a phrase on onboarding to write down. So I think for crypto to go more mainstream, we want it to be less crypto native, where it feels more like you're interacting with your friends and meeting cool people and understanding who other people are, rather than like, oh, signing messages and understanding what token accounts are and all this crazy stuff that not everyone, we can't expect everyone to know about.
00:30:02.626 - 00:30:06.962, Speaker C: Crypto native doesn't have to mean. It's complex. Right? I think I really want to challenge that. I don't know. We run out of time.
00:30:06.978 - 00:30:07.654, Speaker E: Yeah. Yeah.
00:30:10.194 - 00:30:17.594, Speaker A: Well, thank you all so much for being here and talking with us today. Victor, Max, Philip Bryan. Thank you very much, Victor.
00:30:17.634 - 00:30:17.914, Speaker B: Thank you.
