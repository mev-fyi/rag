00:00:01.160 - 00:00:22.434, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Very happy to be here, bringing this conversation, very important with David, Greg and Rob. So I'm Paulo Palermo. I'm co founder at Impacta Finance and we are building an intelligence layer on top of digital impact assets. And then I would love for you to intro yourself and what you're doing in refine.
00:00:23.214 - 00:00:40.194, Speaker B: I'm David Dahl, I'm the co founder of Gainforce, which is a decentralized monitoring platform, opening up all the data of the environment, trying to make sure that impact is very transparently captured and tokenized and basically building the data baseline infrastructure for anything you want to build on top of it.
00:00:41.014 - 00:01:03.014, Speaker C: Hi everybody, I'm Gregory, I'm one of the founders of Regen Network and we're building a decentralized carbon and ecological asset registry system that's fused into a peer to peer marketplace. And you could sort of think of what we're doing as a multi chain layer, two specifically for governance of standards and asset origination.
00:01:04.234 - 00:01:25.990, Speaker D: Hey, my name is Robert, I'm one of the co founders of toucan. We've built a bridge for tokenizing carbon credits and we've tokenized around 22 million tons of carbon credits and have an ecosystem around 100 plus builders using those carbon credits to build everything from marketplaces to currencies, all the things in between.
00:01:26.182 - 00:01:35.950, Speaker A: Oh, and then maybe we can kickstart with the true og on Refi. Greg, tell us a bit. What is Refi? What is residentive finance?
00:01:36.022 - 00:03:05.178, Speaker C: Well, to start, yeah, Refi is not refinancing your home. So Refi, regenerative finance, I think at its essence, is coming from the perspective that finance and markets can be a force for good. And specifically, I think a lot of the community is very focused on how do we fund and finance public goods broadly, and specifically, how are we using the tools that we have available in web3 to transform climate change into a more regenerative society. And so you have a lot of people thinking about carbon markets, you have a lot of people thinking about dynamic nfts, you have a lot of people thinking about different forms of funding public goods. And together we all sort of self identify as regions as part of the refi movement, and it's really turned into quite a meme. And the last thing I'll say before I pass it off is in case this all just sort of comes off as sort of a hand wavy group of hippies doing a conjuring circle around, you know, good. I would invite everybody to consider that some pretty serious economic analysis shows that the most likely outcome is that climate finance broadly, and the natural capital markets.
00:03:05.178 - 00:03:55.036, Speaker C: And what we might refer to as Refi is probably set to become a multi trillion dollar per year industry, something on the order of the scale of the military industrial complex. You sort of think today in civilization, humans pay something like two to $3 trillion per year for security in quotes. And that's sort of the war machine or the war apparatus, as well as intelligence and all of the things that go into that. Well, it turns out that internalizing, like security, goes beyond just security of national borders and those sorts of things. Climate resilience and biodiversity and funding. The sort of regenerating the relationship between humans and the rest of the world is actually security. It's resilience.
00:03:55.036 - 00:04:47.104, Speaker C: And I think there's broad buy in from pretty much everyone that that needs to be internalized, those costs need to be internalized into our economy. The challenges with the previous attempts to this previous to Refi, like ESG and the sdgs, is that it gets, it's very hand wavy, right. And it's very hard to prove impact. So interweb3, right. The ability to have a durable record of who is saying what about where using wet data, the ability to coordinate and govern those standards on chain as the base layer before we create these hyper efficient markets, is really what's transformational and exciting about Refi. And everybody up on the stage is doing really fantastic work. So I'm going to pause and pass it back.
00:04:47.104 - 00:04:58.270, Speaker C: I kind of, if I was to tee it up, I'd go over to David briefly to talk about, because they're doing a lot of this work around the science dynamic, NFT, some of the building blocks, I think.
00:04:58.422 - 00:05:10.326, Speaker A: Sure, David, I think you're a great case here because you're building on Solana. And then I think it's a very nice example for us to share a bit about game forest and the work you do with conservation communities.
00:05:10.430 - 00:06:15.048, Speaker B: Man, Solana is such a great chain, first of all, and a perfect chain for dynamic nfts, transparency measurements. And that's what really underlies our protocol in our system. Gain forest really wants to. Because when you talk about Refi, when you talk about this emerging market of tokenizing common goods, making sure that people invest in what we see as probably the biggest market failure in the traditional system, that we don't value nature, we don't value carbon, I mean, have you noticed how shitty our planet is right now? I mean, this is something, a big market failure, that is because there's a lack of data of what impact is, how we can really trade it, how we can tokenize it. And Solana is great for that because basically our protocol captures impact at its most core. So we use satellite data, we use drone imagery, but we also allow people on the ground to collect measured trees. And these trees, for example, capture carbon, but they're also really great for the environment because they allow birds and other animals to flourish.
00:06:15.048 - 00:07:08.986, Speaker B: And all of the data, we just tokenized and captured that. And people can create digital assets of that. For example, the most classical ones is carbon credits, where it's very clear that if we want to avoid a climate disaster, many companies need to go to net zero as fast as possible, and many need to use common credits in order to have this transition. So the demand comes there. And then using this transparent system of all the data layer being available here on Solana, also being represented in potentially really useful nfts that dynamically update whenever data that is changing really, really secures your asset from any reputational risks. Because it's clear for you, you can just click on an asset, you see exactly the data, you see exactly the transparency, you see exactly who collected the data and how things were calculated, and that it's something that is lacking in the existing market. Because in the existing market, you have no idea.
00:07:08.986 - 00:07:37.314, Speaker B: When you donate to a conservation project, when you buy a carbon offset, what that is, you have no idea. There are recent studies where someone invested in a car credits project and only a couple percentage of the money you invested went to the project developers themselves. More than 60% went to a broker. And that's a reputational risk you're having as some institutional investor. And you don't have that risk when you're basically having everything transparently laid out in the blockchain.
00:07:37.834 - 00:08:16.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is a great use case for blockchain technology as well. And when we are chatting about real assets on chain, because you actually use sensors and other type of device that can actually bring real information differently from other types of records. Right. So I think this is a great example of what you do. And also, Rob, I think that we can ask you about carbon markets because also in the traditional market, when we are talking about green finance, carbon has a real value, has real market value and own chain as well. So we are seeing a lot of potential for this asset to be the leading refi digital asset. Right.
00:08:16.604 - 00:08:20.504, Speaker A: So tell us a bit on how is to work with carbon on chain.
00:08:20.844 - 00:09:11.612, Speaker D: Yeah, so I mean, there's right now a fairly significant supply of carbon credits on chain. And currently the trading volume of these carbon credits last year at least was the vast majority of the entire market's trading volume was on chain. So these are being very widely traded, they're highly liquid. And that means that you can, as someone who needs to offset your project, you can source credits in a much more efficient way. And what was mentioned before, about 60% of the funds from carbon credits going to brokers and middlemen. This can largely be circumvented by disintermediating the market. So by only having all of this be based on smart contracts that are largely automated and have very low fees, you can shrink that number significantly.
00:09:11.612 - 00:10:05.184, Speaker D: So someone can, instead of going through a broker or multiple layers of brokers to buy these credits, they can just immediately access it on the market. So we've seen really quite an advanced market emerge with multiple different types of marketplaces and multiple different types of ways to structure these kind of carbon products. And I think Defi really has built a lot of very unique tooling. I mean, there's been a lot of just tremendous innovation happening in the last two years, especially in Defi. And a lot of the learnings from there can be tied into carbon markets and really make so that carbon markets which currently are really, really broken, like carbon markets right now, that are off chain. When you're buying carbon credits, you need to do a paper contract and it takes multiple weeks to settle it. You need to involve lawyers, there's trust involved in that.
00:10:05.184 - 00:10:30.534, Speaker D: And it's just quite crazy that this type of market is still operating with that type of technology stack. And we can bring this using the state of the art of defi. We can really advance the market, make it much more efficient, and make it so that the funding that goes through these carbon credits, it goes to actual projects. And that we have just a very efficient stack that can direct the funding towards those public goods.
00:10:31.194 - 00:10:42.646, Speaker A: And have you seen some Defi instruments already using carbon credits? Or is this an invitation for all the builders here also to start thinking in this type of asset?
00:10:42.810 - 00:11:12.966, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a lot of. I think there was the very early one, which was Klima, which was fork of Olympus Dao. That was one big experiment which didn't go that well. But I think really kind of showed what could be done. There's been lending markets, there's been people building stablecoins. I think there's different types of currencies that are backed by carbon. There's also carbon on multiple different types of exchanges.
00:11:12.966 - 00:11:51.416, Speaker D: There's also multiple different types of marketplaces. So yeah, there's quite a lot of innovation that's happening there. But with that said, we're still very, very early. I mean, a lot of this innovation has been happening in the last year or so, and most of these projects that are building this, they started building in the last, let's say, half a year, and it just takes a bit of time to raise money to create a team, to create a product. And so we're just still so extremely early. And I think there's going to be multiple decades of growth in this space ahead. And so I think, as a builder, this is the right time to start building.
00:11:51.416 - 00:12:01.592, Speaker D: We've seen traction, we've seen validation, but there's just so much stuff to build. So, yeah, I think it's definitely an invitation for anyone to explore building with tokenized carbon.
00:12:01.688 - 00:12:22.124, Speaker A: There is a very nice space. I'm so happy that we are full time on this, and I love the topic of this chat because I'm from Brazil and we have a lot of natural assets, but a very beautiful djing crowd. So, Greg, can you help us to understand the difference between Djens and regions and how they can do some stuff together if they can?
00:12:22.204 - 00:13:30.264, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So the journey from Degen to Regen and maybe back again, I don't know. So, I mean, generally speaking, I think we could sort of say that, and maybe we use the idea that a degen is looking to extract as much value or profit from a particular exchange as possible. And I think a region is looking to maximize in that interaction the amount of public good that's being generated by the interaction. And the question is, can we use applied cryptography, crypto economics, state machines, blockchain smart contracts, in order to align those two incentives whereby winning the game is providing the most public good, whereby reputation and profit are gleaned from most efficiently fixing climate change. Really, the journey from DGEn to region. How do we, you know, in Solana? Mad props.
00:13:30.264 - 00:13:53.832, Speaker C: I'm not. We're building bridges to Solana. Look forward to eco credits in Solana. Super excited about Solana. And I come from a different corner of the crypto ecosystem and from the outside looking in. My perception has always been that the culture of Solana is enormously pragmatic and just, like, gets things done. Like, there's an engineering problem, there's a challenge.
00:13:53.832 - 00:14:56.260, Speaker C: Community comes together and is cranking on it. Hacker houses, and there's so much direction and energy and focus. And I'm super excited about Solana sort of uptaking this quest from DGen to region and starting to engage with Refi because that the sets of primitives that are necessary and the reinvention of the game to really start applying all of that innovation to this question, it's very enlivening. First off, it's super fun. There's such an amazing design space, and it's just really, at the end of the day, it's going to take, I believe web3 really needs to actually step up and take leadership around a lot of these coordination issues, because I don't have a huge amount of hope that the traditional incumbent institutions are going to be capable of coordinating as effectively and iterating as rapidly. And so this isn't sort of like one chain or another. This is everybody iterating and innovating together.
00:14:56.260 - 00:14:59.292, Speaker C: That's really going to make refi a force for good in the world.
00:14:59.428 - 00:15:15.638, Speaker A: Wow, I love this. But do you think that we can have short term returns or long term returns at the same time? Because sometimes we feel that degens and regions, they might not be super happy together, maybe. David, what is your opinion about it?
00:15:15.726 - 00:16:02.008, Speaker B: I actually think as much as we didn't let ourselves, the cryptocurrency, constrain ourselves just to trade with fiat money, and we invented, basically, Satoshi invented bitcoin with artificial scarcity, like 21 million bitcoins. That created value region is just allowing us to trade with more assets, not just the traditional tokens, but nature itself. Carbon. Carbon actually one of the most scarce resources in the world. Because that scarcity is not determined by protocol, it's determined by physics. We have a certain kind of limit we are still allowed to give out. So over the years, in a couple, the next five to seven years, actually very, very critical period that reaches this really physical limit of where our existence is potentially threatened.
00:16:02.008 - 00:16:48.714, Speaker B: And if I don't see value in that, I mean, that's insane. Value that can be generated, that can be traded, can be immediately copied, the same protocols we have in DeFi, but just use it, expand it on these new asset class that basically refi regions allow. So I see it more like a superset of assets that we allow ourselves to conceptualize and trade with. And you can immediately see the profit in that. So people already start buying a lot of common credits. People are slowly looking into biodiversity credit because biodiversity crisis, we stock a lot of climate crisis. We have so many crises going on the earth, so much scarcity that's coming up now, so much value that we can emphasize and we can capture, for example, that trickles down immediately back.
00:16:48.714 - 00:17:30.699, Speaker B: The blockchain based system, for example, we conceptualize a method called measure to earn in gainforce, where we allow local communities to capture, for example, their natural goods with pictures every couple of weeks. And that picture then translates directly into tokenized impact. And when we can sell that, they get back something. Right. This is immediate impact from them for what they basically provide to the market. I believe there's many, many different ideas from Defi inspired or even beyond that we haven't even conceptualized yet, that can really accelerate not only the good for our human race, but also the whole new asset class and making at the same time, huge profit for the Solano community and beyond.
00:17:30.891 - 00:18:08.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is a very interesting point. And as you brought the term of scarcity, I think also the word regeneration stands for having more positive outcomes and also externalities rather than negative externalities. Right. So I'm also with some questions about if all the setters build on scarcity, because all the projects use scarcity and even fake scarcity, too, actually work. What about our regeneration efforts? So can we also have the same instruments, returns and investment with regeneration, what do you think?
00:18:10.914 - 00:19:21.902, Speaker C: Yes, and it's going to be a different, you know, I think the realigning of short term profits with long term ecological health, or the realignment of short term profits with provision of public goods. We see glimpses of how this can work with the sheer amount of open source innovation that web3 is driving. So you have this economy, and the exhaust of that economy is a huge amount of computer science output, maybe an unprecedented amount of open source computer science output. So, I mean, to me, there's evidence, right, that we can actually align. We can say, you know, we want to build an economy based on regeneration and defining regeneration. For me, you know, ecological regeneration, what does that mean? What do I actually mean by that? What I mean by that is increasing the evolutionary capacity of our biosphere and the life living in the biosphere to maintain itself. Ecological integrity, ecological function, biodiversity, healthy carbon cycles.
00:19:21.902 - 00:20:36.542, Speaker C: That's what I mean by regeneration, right? You measure that by net gain in soil carbon or preservation of biodiversity, or net gain of above ground biomass in a reforestation effort, or whatever it may be. Each one of those, as David's been saying, you can gamify different layers of it, right? So we can build a game around monitoring, measuring, and quantifying things. We can build a game around actually achieving the outcomes. We can link both of those to our understanding of atmospheric science and how much carbon needs to be sequestered, and we can link that stack up. And this is what Rob was inviting us to see we can link that stack up to this composable, hyper efficient set of market mechanisms. And again, this is where I start to get excited about the potential of the Solana community getting galvanized into this, because there really isn't the efficiency of trading and frequency of trading possible on Solana is quite exciting. So you parlay all of that into the efficient market hypothesis, and it's pretty exciting.
00:20:36.542 - 00:20:40.418, Speaker C: What could be accomplished as a coordination. Yeah.
00:20:40.466 - 00:21:20.702, Speaker D: Just to add to that, I would add another nuance of that. Capitalism has really created a lot of stuff. It really is a force to create change and to create things. And really, this movement, in my opinion, is about redirecting some of that change, not all of it. If two to 3% of all GDP goes towards regeneration, still 98, 97% will go towards the normal stuff. But you could see, if we can gear capitalism to prioritize and really value some of these natural assets, then you can really create a lot of change in that area, because it is really an engine for change. It's an engine that created all the things we have around us.
00:21:20.702 - 00:21:33.094, Speaker D: And so it's really just about fixing that. In my opinion, glitch we have right now, I think we're creating the mechanisms to support that to happen. And this is the back end of that change.
00:21:34.074 - 00:21:57.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I see this happening right now with a lot of things, with the possibility to being built on top of those natural assets. Right. And also, as we're talking about assets that have real value in the market, do you guys think there is a potential decoration opportunity for us to the whole crypto market and decide the cycles that we have with those natural assets, with real value of chain as well?
00:21:58.254 - 00:22:24.570, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think, you know, not financial advice. Right. But I do think you have physics. You have a limited amount of atmospheric carbon that our planet can absorb and maintain a biosphere conducive to current, to current economic conditions? Right. That's quantifiable. It's this amazing.
00:22:24.570 - 00:23:05.472, Speaker C: It's not artificial scarcity at all. It's real scarcity. Okay. And then you have conditions whereby it's gonna get, you know, it's never going to be cheaper than it is right now to sequester that carbon out of the atmosphere, to capture it, and to, you know, so we're gonna have this scenario. It's sort of like the perfect conditions for us to point that capitalism gun and, you know, and there we go. So I think you have the conditions for regenerative assets, for ecological assets. Yeah, essentially, to decorrelate with a lot of the other markets and create sort of value accrual and stability.
00:23:05.472 - 00:23:29.466, Speaker C: And the interesting thing though is will it really decorrelate? Because I think what's going to happen is it's going to be embedded in the market and it's going to usher in a new phase of larger macro conditions if we manage to get that alignment right. So in the end, maybe it doesn't really decorrelate, but the market is starting to correlate to a new mega trend or macro trend to add on this.
00:23:29.490 - 00:24:06.066, Speaker B: We see that trend already in the institutional market that has been like these big comm certificates providers and issuers where they've been looking into using web3 technology. Exactly for the same reasons you just mentioned, that it's too slow to get the job done with the existing technologies they have. Web three is very fast, very transparent. This is exactly the lag they are facing. And also this huge urgency we have. We don't have a lot of time left in order to get these things fixed. So urgency scarcity creates a lot of value and that's perfectly suited for our community to fix it.
00:24:06.170 - 00:24:22.550, Speaker A: Yeah, we saw this happening with Defi. Right. And think, I hope this is also the space for us to do this in Refi as well. Fixing those market is creating new spaces and opportunities that was never there. So I think this is the right moment for it. Right.
00:24:22.662 - 00:24:43.978, Speaker B: And because we have a couple seconds left, we all organize a refi site event right after this, the first Solana Refi site event. Super excited for you guys to come. Yeah, we have 150 spots, first come, first serve, so we have 220 booked, just letting you know. But like, happy to continue that conversation. Right?
00:24:44.026 - 00:24:56.882, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. I think everyone here is available as well for any questions you might have afterwards, or also curiosities on how we could integrate Djens and regions together. I think this will be fun.
00:24:57.018 - 00:25:11.654, Speaker C: Yeah. But unfortunately, none of us will be available right afterwards to jam as much as I want to because we have to hustle over to the event that got scheduled. Magically, this talk was scheduled with like five minutes to spare.
00:25:12.074 - 00:25:13.514, Speaker B: That's the sense of urgency.
00:25:13.594 - 00:25:17.858, Speaker C: It's a sense of urgency, yeah, but come with us over there and then let's jam.
00:25:18.026 - 00:25:20.826, Speaker A: Planetary regeneration is urgent. So.
00:25:20.890 - 00:25:21.534, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:22.274 - 00:25:29.714, Speaker A: Thank you so much, everyone. We are all available here, region networking for us and also token protocol. I hope we can build nights theft together.
