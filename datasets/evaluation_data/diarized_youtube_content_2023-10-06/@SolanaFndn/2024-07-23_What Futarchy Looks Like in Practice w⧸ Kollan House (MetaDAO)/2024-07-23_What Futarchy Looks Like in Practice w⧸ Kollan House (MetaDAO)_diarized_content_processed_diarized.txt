00:00:04.640 - 00:00:06.422, Speaker A: Colin, welcome to validated.
00:00:06.526 - 00:00:08.038, Speaker B: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.
00:00:08.134 - 00:00:34.364, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for making the trip up. So futarchy is what we're going to be talking about today. There has been so much back and forth on twitter about this. Me having been a political science major, like, spend a lot of time thinking about these types of things. I have all sorts of questions, things I'm excited about, things I'm concerned about. Uh, so I think we'll have a pretty good discussion today on this, but let's just start out from the basics. What is futarchy?
00:00:34.452 - 00:01:01.820, Speaker B: Yeah. So few turkey is using decision markets to, in place of voting. So, uh, it's different in the fact that you're asking somebody to say, what would this impact be if it were to occur versus a prediction market that says, will this occur? And instead of voting yes or no, we. What we use in decision markets is whatever the higher impact would be is the decision that's made. Right.
00:01:01.860 - 00:01:16.076, Speaker A: So it's basically, prediction markets are normative. This is positivist, this is articulate, as opposed to articulating what you think the change will be, which is a normativist activity. This is. What do you think? Would this change be good or not.
00:01:16.228 - 00:01:19.548, Speaker B: Good and good in what context? I think is important to bring there.
00:01:19.604 - 00:01:20.012, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:20.116 - 00:01:27.982, Speaker B: Bring that up to. To the surface level, because you could do a lot of different things with this rather than just using the price of something.
00:01:28.086 - 00:01:50.180, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to kind of start out with, like, a bit of, like a framing on governance here, and then we can, like, get into it, because I think there's a lot of easy attacks to make on futarchy that are not specific to it. Right. So there is no such thing as a perfect governance system. The. The meat space governance system of one citizen. One vote has all sorts of problems.
00:01:50.180 - 00:02:25.722, Speaker A: Who do you define as citizens? Is it only white people? Is it only men? Right. How hard is it to become a citizen? Right. You look at, there's plenty of countries in the world where the population is quite large, but the citizenry is quite small. So there's all sorts of real world problems with governance, too. You have the electoral college in the United States, which is a bug and a feature. You look at blockchain governance. And one token, one vote is an interesting model, but it is effectively an oligarchy, right, where the more money you have, the more vote you have.
00:02:25.722 - 00:03:21.124, Speaker A: There's all sorts of ways that have been thought to address that, like quadratic voting, where your vote power diminishes based on the number of tokens you have, but the cost of making a wallet is zero. And so an engineer in 45 to 75 minutes can spin up a nice script that distributes your stake and automatically votes all these other wallets. So there's kind of this fundamental problem in blockchain of, we don't have an analogy to a citizen, right, without forcing everyone to go through KYC, which defeats a part of the purpose of many of these permissionless, decentralized networks. So what's interesting to me is this is, I think, the only new take I've seen on governance in a while. There's a lot of downsides of this, too. So I kind of want you to like, before we get into that, I want you to like, walk us through the theoretical underpinnings of how these systems should work when we're talking about market based governance.
00:03:21.212 - 00:04:09.212, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it comes down to market theory and the behavior of markets, where you have sophisticated participants that trade off of their information, and you've created an incentive structure in markets where if you have better information, then in theory you have the opportunity to generate profit. And so you drive the attention to there by default through the incentive structure. Rather than corralling everybody together, spending billions of dollars on campaigns and everything else that needs to go into these systems to just drive attention and get people to show up to vote, you can kind of sit there and say what it, what would be the perfect incentive structure to get the most information we could from the ether available to us, and then that drives it straight back to a market and what markets do.
00:04:09.236 - 00:04:15.680, Speaker A: Well, so why would a market be better at this than a bunch of people voting?
00:04:15.980 - 00:04:24.612, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the market drives parties that can surface information that you may not know or have access to.
00:04:24.716 - 00:04:25.092, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:25.156 - 00:05:13.876, Speaker B: So a wisdom of the crowd doesn't, you know, like experts and specialists don't look at crowds unless the crowds are better than the experts and specialists. So I don't think that there's this evolution where you want everybody voting per se. You just want to surface the best information because this is outcome driven. So if we were to enact a policy in the United States that said, hey, we want to increase GDP and longevity of life and all these other things, it'd be much better to evaluate it based on the latest scientific research or the people with the most information and let them provide their outlook and their forecasts and their information. A market than a person. Right? Like a person that's like, oh, I don't, you know, I may not know anything about science, but this is how I feel.
00:05:14.028 - 00:06:05.088, Speaker A: Right. So I guess the place that, like, my mind goes with this is, again, like, there are plenty of problems in all other governance systems, but we're kind of here today to talk about the benefits and problems of this specific governance system. So I just want to, like, give you the pass of there's many things wrong with everyone else, too. Um, I guess the place my mind goes is to market crash phenomenons or bubbles. And I think there's a way you could, like, if we're going to use financial language to describe everything, I think you could call the run up to the war in Iraq a bubble. Got it right like that is that. That is a situation where a market, in this case, stakeholders in the United States, for, however you define that, believed information which was not true, but truly believed that Iraq was full of weapons of mass destruction and we had to go in and clean them out.
00:06:05.088 - 00:07:08.100, Speaker A: Right. No evidence of that to the effect. So you can have bubbles in traditional governance systems, but they're called sort of like groupthink. You can also have bubbles in economic systems, too, whether it's the 2008 housing crash, whether it is that those sort of micro crashes that have occurred in the stock market where a bunch of algorithmic trading all decides everything's going down. And we can't quite figure out how Nike capital, which famously had massive bugs in their systems and lost all their money in about 45 minutes to the crashes related to things like Covid. So markets are definitely not perfect. So how would a governance system that has the sort of market forces you're talking about? I don't want to call it survive, but would you have governance crashes potentially in the same way that you have market crashes today? If we're taking markets and instilling that into governance systems? And how do you build systems around that idea?
00:07:08.220 - 00:07:39.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that that's certainly an interesting question because you don't avoid that in traditional governance. Right? Like you have this imperfect information and then, you know, people, people act on it. So I think that market perturbations as described there are probably just as normal as the issues with democracy that we have, that you just articulated. So, yeah, we have the tulip bubble. You have this irrational behavior in markets.
00:07:39.372 - 00:07:39.796, Speaker A: Sure.
00:07:39.908 - 00:08:03.502, Speaker B: And I think the, you know, the original paper that Robin Hansen wrote describes this, where you have noise traders, you have market manipulation. So in theory, you have all these different participants with different incentives and different information that would probably surface it more aggressively because the incentive to make money is there is the way that I might think about it.
00:08:03.646 - 00:08:08.330, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of funny to think of, like, Fox News or MSNBC as wash trading.
00:08:08.630 - 00:08:09.014, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:09.062 - 00:08:17.454, Speaker A: But, like, it's kind of an interesting idea that there's actually market systems and information systems are more similar than they are different.
00:08:17.542 - 00:08:40.418, Speaker B: Yeah. And the fact is that trading in a market, you have to put capital at risk. So you may exhaust yourself as a participant, because how long do you trade poorly until you have no more capital to trade. Right. That plays out where you can only make so many bad decisions to your disadvantage, and then you're no longer a participant in the market.
00:08:40.594 - 00:08:42.578, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess that's a feature and a bug.
00:08:42.634 - 00:08:42.946, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:43.018 - 00:09:04.150, Speaker A: Because a core tenet of modern democracies is that no one really gets truly canceled. People say they've got canceled before, but, like, you know, for the most part, they still have their Twitter. They still have their YouTube. They can still go and protest. They can still write letters. They can still write op eds. They can launch their own media network.
00:09:04.150 - 00:09:11.606, Speaker A: Like, fundamentally, censorship in the United States is quite hard to enact. I think we're gonna get a lot of angry comments about that.
00:09:11.638 - 00:09:13.766, Speaker B: I was gonna say we've gotten really political really quickly.
00:09:13.798 - 00:09:34.690, Speaker A: No, no, but what I mean by that is, like. Like, even when someone is deplatformed, they are not unable to assert their opinion. But in a market based governance system, when you're out of money, like, that's it. Your. Your speech is effectively reduced to zero. Whereas in a system where, you know, you're kicked off Twitter or YouTube, you still have speech. Right.
00:09:34.690 - 00:09:56.480, Speaker A: Alex Jones is still out there doing his thing even when he was removed from all these platforms. And, yes, his reach is lower, but, like, if the message is compelling enough of. Of someone in a political space, they can break through that censorship level that doesn't really exist in a market driven system. Or is the assumption there that if I like your ideas, I will donate so you can continue?
00:09:57.020 - 00:10:57.504, Speaker B: Yeah, potentially, right. If you do profit generated design for this, which is what markets are there to do, I think what you end up with is you don't have these pockets of misinformation because you have afforded the people with the best opinions that are driving these forces. And it comes back down to what metrics are you evaluating rather than just price oriented metrics? If you said, we are actually improving scientific research, longevity for people's lives, their happiness score, these things objectively are measurable. And then you say, these people are not helping and is proven in the market because they have been unsuccessful. So I think you still get that where people can still express, and we've seen it in our discord, too, where people are very riled up about different proposals. Right. But all of that is for naught because you put it to the market and you got a trade.
00:10:57.632 - 00:11:12.900, Speaker A: Interesting. I want to get into metadata and how it works, but the kind of. Before we, before we get there, I want to talk a little bit about, like, market capture as like a theory here, because I think you could make an argument there's political capture.
00:11:12.980 - 00:11:13.196, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:13.228 - 00:11:40.626, Speaker A: Like that. You know, we like to pretend we have two parties in this, in this country. We have two factions of the same party, and the party is capitalism. But we saw things like in the 1980s, like corporate raiders that were going in and they were able to sort of take over companies and extract a lot of value from them in ways that weren't beneficial to the long term survival of that company or organization. How would something like that play out in the futarchy based governance system?
00:11:40.738 - 00:11:46.506, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that just comes back to the metrics and monitoring. Right. That you aren't necessarily.
00:11:46.538 - 00:11:51.050, Speaker A: But do the metrics, like, step in what is the sort of check and balance on a system there?
00:11:51.130 - 00:12:40.284, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think what's proposed at a high level for futurchy to function has been like, use democracy to say what metrics are important to the. To the populace. And then what you do is you put that to a trade in the markets saying, do the markets, do the participants of the markets believe that this policy, which is important to the people, is moving the needle on those metrics? That's where I think you get away from this price rating or this value rating system. It comes back to, you have to design these metrics very critically. But we're only getting better at those kinds of things. As social sciences develop, as we start to monitor and measure all of these things, it starts to get more objectively reasonable that this stuff can be measured and quantified.
00:12:40.412 - 00:13:05.550, Speaker A: Yeah. So does that mean. And I really do want to get to metadata, but this stuff is so fascinating, at least to me. So one of the pieces that's been really a debate in the United States probably over the last 15 or 20 years is Chevron deference and standing. Okay, right. Chevron deference standing in scrutiny. We don't have to get into all the, like, Supreme Court, church Latin around this stuff, but, like, Chevron deference is.
00:13:05.550 - 00:14:01.400, Speaker A: Is this idea that agencies have certain amounts of power to make rules because they're experts in that domain. Right. This is the argument that an act of Congress does not need to set the right level of lead that's acceptable in your drinking water supply. The EPA is empowered as a group of experts to set that level. So you mentioned before sort of the idea of experts versus direct democracy and that there's different outcomes when you have different groups involved. How does the sort of theories underpinning these market decisions apply to highly technical decisions? Because I think if you go to proper blockchain governance and there's questions like, should we raise the Cu limit on Solana today? And it's like, there's probably only 5000 people in the world who are qualified to have an opinion whether that should happen. But if you ask Twitter whether that should happen, you'll get 2 million Solana users saying, absolutely.
00:14:01.400 - 00:14:02.104, Speaker A: Raise the blocks.
00:14:02.152 - 00:14:09.792, Speaker B: Yeah. Which kind of goes back to why the, you know, like one, one user, one vote probably isn't the best way to proceed forward with this.
00:14:09.856 - 00:14:10.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:10.320 - 00:14:22.900, Speaker B: And I think that there's, there's two parts there. One is that absolutely the way that in theory, this evolves is that the experts are the ones that are building the proposals themselves. Right. Interesting.
00:14:22.940 - 00:14:23.132, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:23.156 - 00:14:32.412, Speaker B: So they're the ones that say, hey, we believe that lead should be this level because they're the experts in that space and they're the ones crafting the proposals. And then the markets trade based on that information.
00:14:32.556 - 00:14:37.428, Speaker A: Okay, so you might have a permissioned proposal system, but then, like an open market system.
00:14:37.484 - 00:15:01.196, Speaker B: Well. Or not even permissioned. It's just the proposals that are good will be crafted by experts because then they will be better traded. You will have more information to trade off of versus. If I go in there and just have some broad proposal, it's hard to trade and it's hard to speculate on. Right. Even if the proposal is poorly crafted and it fails, that's not a reflection that it didn't work.
00:15:01.196 - 00:15:05.644, Speaker B: It's a reflection that the proposal was maybe garbage to begin with.
00:15:05.732 - 00:15:06.492, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:15:06.636 - 00:15:42.604, Speaker B: And then the betting markets for pollsters compared to pollsters for the presidential elections, I think in 1980, there were like 400 traders and they beat pollsters. And then even now, today, there's 1400 traders and they're beating pollsters. So you don't need a lot of that information. You probably need two participants with compelling and competing information to accurately price a market. Right. So I don't think that there's this intrinsic demand that says, well, you've got 7 billion people and 7 billion people need to participate. No, you need the experts to participate.
00:15:42.604 - 00:15:45.788, Speaker B: And in doing so, you'll probably make better, effective decisions.
00:15:45.884 - 00:16:02.220, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, so let's transition now into how this is actually used in practice, because futarchy, as you said, it was invented, for lack of a better term, a while ago, but it really hasn't been put into practice yet, except mostly in metadata.
00:16:02.340 - 00:16:31.210, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's one of those things that we sit down and we're like, why hasn't anybody built this? There's been teams that have promised to build it or have speculated to, you know, that we're crafting it. I think people end up with prediction markets because that's easier. And I'll be the first to admit, like, trading these markets is unintuitive to people. This is not. When people come in and they have this preconceived notion of participation being voting. Right? And then they're like, well, I have these tokens.
00:16:31.210 - 00:16:41.434, Speaker B: How do I trade them to express my vote? And you're like, are you a good trader? No. Well, then don't participate. This is not your place to play.
00:16:41.522 - 00:16:45.826, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to get into like, brass tax. How does this work?
00:16:45.898 - 00:16:46.106, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:46.138 - 00:17:11.140, Speaker A: If I'm going to a prediction market and I say, uh, whatever, right, something I want to. I have a high conviction on this. I can go to that prediction market, I can put assets at risk, and there's a win loss ratio, return of, like, oh, if my thing returns, well, I'm going to get four x what I put in, because I'm in a contrary opinion to what everyone else thinks. Um, and if I lose, then, you know, my position is lost.
00:17:11.220 - 00:17:11.460, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:11.500 - 00:17:13.804, Speaker A: Like, it's very similar to betting on a horse race.
00:17:13.852 - 00:17:14.484, Speaker B: Yep.
00:17:14.652 - 00:17:23.900, Speaker A: How? Walk me through the economics of, as a participant in a futarchy based governance system. Today in Metadao, how does that work?
00:17:23.980 - 00:17:30.780, Speaker B: Yeah. So you have your, like, underlying base token right now, and then you have USDC as the quote token.
00:17:30.860 - 00:17:31.172, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:31.236 - 00:17:58.170, Speaker B: And what we do is we create a canonical fork of the tokens to participate in these markets. In this case, right now, in this version, we have pass and fail. Okay, so you have, you deposit a meta token and then you mint conditional tokens, which is pass and fail meta. And then you have these two markets that you can trade in. Right. Effectively. So you can do the same thing with USDC, you can do the same thing with meta.
00:17:58.170 - 00:18:10.344, Speaker B: You're asking people to do is evaluate the impact of this proposal passing or this proposal failing. Right. So you're asking them, in this case, the impact is price.
00:18:10.472 - 00:18:10.968, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:11.064 - 00:18:23.264, Speaker B: So is this underpriced or overpriced or undervalued or overvalued? And is the past market compared to spot overvalued, or is the fail market compared to spot undervalued?
00:18:23.352 - 00:18:23.816, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:23.928 - 00:18:38.670, Speaker B: So you have these, these three effective markets, right, bought, you have your conditional pass, conditional fail, and all economic activity can occur in all three of those markets, and they're all intertwined due to the fact that it's price driven.
00:18:39.370 - 00:19:03.290, Speaker A: But if I'm voting on governance today, any blockchain system that exists, I'm not really putting assets at risk. At worst, what I'm doing is locking them up for a certain period of time if a vote is close. So if I'm like a, I don't know if I'm a fund or something like that, and I have an opinion on how something should be governed, am I actually spending capital if I lose the vote?
00:19:03.790 - 00:19:28.830, Speaker B: If you lose the vote, no. Right? Because only one of those markets becomes canonical. So in the case that you mint conditional tokens and you only trade the fail market and the past market succeeds, you get the full amount of the past tokens back to. To the underlying assets. So it's whatever market the activity took place in. If that market didn't ultimately resolve.
00:19:28.910 - 00:19:29.262, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:29.326 - 00:19:31.494, Speaker B: Then it's like none of that ever happened.
00:19:31.662 - 00:19:33.966, Speaker A: And then what's the upside? On the win side?
00:19:34.078 - 00:19:39.454, Speaker B: On the win side, you're technically trading it for profit. Right? So what you're trying to do is.
00:19:39.502 - 00:19:45.050, Speaker A: Sorry, the age old question, where is, who's the yield? Where does the profit come from in that?
00:19:45.110 - 00:20:07.794, Speaker B: So the profit comes from mispricing of other people and the arbitrage opportunity between the spot and the conditional markets. Right. So we, they exist in isolation. And what you can effectively do here is say, uh, the spot price changed, the conditional market should change as well. Otherwise it's a free arbitrage. Or if you consider time risk. Right.
00:20:07.794 - 00:20:47.122, Speaker B: It's not free necessarily, but I'm willing to take that risk because I think that this proposal should pass or that this proposal is going to bring value. One of the clear things for me is uniswap fee switch. If you had a few target vote, and even if you had 20 over the years, eventually you get to a point where this will pass. And because of the implications of the fee switch passing, it appreciates the price. The proposal goes on. It's more and more likely that this is about to pass. So the spot price and the conditional price should converge, close the arbitrage opportunity loop.
00:20:47.122 - 00:21:29.650, Speaker B: And so you would have this decision made long before your head of operations says, hey, now's the time. Because fundamentally, this is good for the underlying token. And so I think that those are the interesting plays when the proposal is actually adding value and it's measurable, where you sit there and you say, if this was to pass, we have three days for it to pass, then it's going to add 10% value. And we know that, but only as the three days progress do you know for certain that that value is going to be solidified so that the spot price and the conditional price ultimately converge.
00:21:30.310 - 00:21:47.232, Speaker A: Interesting. Let's walk through kind of like a little bit more like, practical example on something like this. I mean, so something like a decision to, like, let's pick something that's as far away as you could from a legal issue, where to host breakpoint next year.
00:21:47.296 - 00:21:47.792, Speaker B: Got it.
00:21:47.856 - 00:21:52.424, Speaker A: Right. How would you go ahead and set something like that up? Using a futarchy governance model?
00:21:52.552 - 00:21:57.496, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that those things are a little bit tricky, because how do you measure the.
00:21:57.608 - 00:22:03.900, Speaker A: Well, let's say there's four proposals of cities from the Solana foundation to simplify the problem space a little bit.
00:22:03.980 - 00:22:36.420, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think, you know, trading within those constraints, people would be able to evaluate, based on, like, their proximity, how many people are going to go, what's the net value being brought back to Solana. I think that there could be quite a number of different things people could trade on. Um, because it's not necessarily value accrual. It'd be harder to trade. Right. But that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't make a decision out of that, per se, because fundamentally, what were trying to ask here is, what is the best thing for Solana in that case.
00:22:36.920 - 00:22:46.600, Speaker A: I guess I would argue that undoubtedly there is more value in doing breakpoint in Asia this year than doing it in Europe again, like weve done the previous three years.
00:22:46.640 - 00:22:47.340, Speaker B: Mhm.
00:22:47.720 - 00:22:49.200, Speaker A: I dont know how to value that.
00:22:49.320 - 00:23:23.088, Speaker B: Yeah. And that comes back to metrics. If we sat there and we said, okay, we want to measure attendance, and we want to measure new founders that are now inspired, we want to measure new asian founders or new asian developers that have come online to Solana. I think that if you set those as the criteria and you said, okay, now let's trade and evaluate this, then suddenly you have a measurable thing like, does breakpoint in Singapore move these metrics? And then that's where we get into the decision.
00:23:23.264 - 00:23:42.792, Speaker A: So none of my experience working for organizations has shown me that they can effectively set KPI's. How much of this is dependent on people being able to accurately predict what actually matters, to set metrics around yeah.
00:23:42.856 - 00:23:46.544, Speaker B: And that's where I think you get back to what's important to people.
00:23:46.672 - 00:23:47.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:48.790 - 00:24:13.958, Speaker B: Collectively, you could argue that a business is profit driven. So making sure that price appreciation to business is the most important thing for shareholders. So you could measure that. And that's our base example right now. That's what we've got deployed on Solana right now, is token price. Token price should go up with all these proposals. Or if this didn't go through, token price is estimated to go down.
00:24:13.958 - 00:24:49.672, Speaker B: Right. I think that that's the, the converse example that you may not be able to speculate on what the future value could be, but you could definitely speculate. If this didn't happen, is it going to negatively impact the price? Interesting, right? So I think you get into some interesting things there. But for decision and organization, you would effectively try to say, like, is this a good business play? Right? Are we going to derive revenues? And do people know more than me about. I used a silly example for drift. Drift buying a zoo. Right? Drift wants to buy a zoo.
00:24:49.672 - 00:25:10.192, Speaker B: They think that it'll return $21 million to holders. I used the example with 1 million tokens. That means you're going to get a 21 x. You get some zebras and some snakes. They really like snakes. But if you just trade the proposal based on face value, that's a 21 x. But somebody that runs a zoo goes, I've never seen a zoo return $21 million.
00:25:10.192 - 00:25:24.274, Speaker B: Right. So they're going to trade and they're going to say, and maybe drift shouldn't be in the business of running a zoo. Right? There are perpetuals, Dex. So I think these silly examples you can start to see we've taken to extreme.
00:25:24.362 - 00:25:45.244, Speaker A: But so some of these markets may be time based too, right? Like for in that example, let's say it passes and drift, or irrespective drift, buys the zoo, right? And I think it's a bad investment. Someone else thinks that's a good investment for, for a drift to buy a zoo. How do, like, how long do you set timelines for determining?
00:25:45.372 - 00:25:52.884, Speaker B: You don't, you don't ask you, you just ask if this occurred, what would be the impact? We're asking you to speculate, not predict.
00:25:53.012 - 00:25:53.388, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:53.444 - 00:26:09.544, Speaker B: And that's what I think that's a key differentiator there. And because people are familiar with yes no voting, yes token voting, they're familiar with prediction markets. But this is kind of in between that it exists as its own, which is saying, if this was to occur, whats the impact of it?
00:26:09.592 - 00:26:27.144, Speaker A: So the way you describe that to me, sounds very analogous to a prediction market. Where am I missing the differentiation between is this a good idea versus will this happen? Because I think a lot of times in governance decisions those are thought of as very much the same thing.
00:26:27.232 - 00:26:53.712, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that a prediction market key is whether it will happen. So if we were going to create a vote with a prediction market, we would say, well, we've got to wait until drift returns 21 x. So we have to wait. All that fund is locked up for a decision market. In this case, futarchy. What we've got deployed is we're asking, you just speculate on the potential if this was to happen.
00:26:53.712 - 00:27:00.192, Speaker B: So what is the impact if this was to happen? So then you unlock it as soon as the proposal passes or fails.
00:27:00.376 - 00:27:00.792, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:00.856 - 00:27:04.944, Speaker B: So in that case, you don't know whether drift's going to succeed.
00:27:05.032 - 00:27:05.416, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:05.488 - 00:27:23.620, Speaker B: Right. You're just using the information that you have right now to be able to trade it as effectively as you can. And in doing that, you surface the information that probably in this case should say that the fail market is probably valued higher than the past market because drift shouldn't be in the business of running a zoo.
00:27:23.960 - 00:27:27.200, Speaker A: Right. And I guess the interesting piece here is these don't have to actually be.
00:27:27.280 - 00:27:30.450, Speaker B: Enforcing governance votes, not necessarily.
00:27:30.530 - 00:27:56.428, Speaker A: Right. So we could vote on this example and that could be totally non binding and there could simply be a profit market that occurred based on that. But because it's not a prediction market, if, let's just say this protocol, we can switch to a hypothetical protocol was run by a dictator and they were just like, no, we're going to do this anyway. That wouldn't necessarily have made the, the market invalid.
00:27:56.524 - 00:28:16.700, Speaker B: No. And I think if you look at it as just an information source, you can be informed by this. Yeah. You could sit there and you could say, I'm going to get better information than I would ever have had if I just use this and then use that as one of the key pieces for my decision making as well.
00:28:16.780 - 00:28:17.348, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:17.484 - 00:29:04.106, Speaker B: And we've seen it with drift interest in just running their grants. Yeah. So, and I think a lot of this has to be proven out. People have to see how does this actually work? How does this actually feel in real life before we start to move into the actionable on chain? Now, metadao operates fully with regards to that, but we still issue memo memo instructions that inform people that this is the action that you're supposed to take. And that's how we structured the Marshall Islands Dao. It's actually governed by memo instructions on the Solana blockchain. So it's quite interesting that you get there that says there's still a social layer, that if you don't adhere to what the DAO is, then it collapses the whole purpose and meaning of the DAO.
00:29:04.258 - 00:29:16.748, Speaker A: So I want to get into some of the stuff you guys have actually done both on a technical level, what you've built out on Solana. And then what are some of the proposals, markets, governance decisions that have actually run through the system today.
00:29:16.844 - 00:29:48.276, Speaker B: And it's been fun. Right. My big thing when I first saw it was I want to try to break this as fast as I can because I want to know if this works or not. And we definitely had some rubber stamped proposals that go through because they make logical sense. And of course, you've got social equity with people, so they're going to trade. There's still going to be Kenzian beauty contests. Certainly in this stuff it's not, it's imperfect, but it should provide a modicum of an iterative step that's progressive.
00:29:48.276 - 00:30:05.570, Speaker B: So we've traded 19 proposals now. I think the 19th is active right now. And we've traded everything from burn the tokens in the treasury to awarding tokens to people well under spot price and then seeing those things fail.
00:30:05.660 - 00:30:08.662, Speaker A: And are these things binding in this model?
00:30:08.766 - 00:30:18.326, Speaker B: Yes. So, like, the instructions set, the proposals contain instructions, and then those instructions can be executed upon proposal finalization.
00:30:18.438 - 00:30:20.982, Speaker A: Okay, so this wasn't like a straw poll.
00:30:21.126 - 00:30:21.718, Speaker B: No.
00:30:21.854 - 00:30:26.086, Speaker A: If this passed, someone would receive a bunch of tokens at far less than market value.
00:30:26.158 - 00:30:45.168, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. And those tokens are wrapped up in the instructions of the proposal, should it, should it succeed. So burn tokens was an interesting one that passed. We took there. There was like, hey, the FDV looks too high, even though these aren't in circulation. So I want to burn all the tokens.
00:30:45.168 - 00:30:55.432, Speaker B: I didn't necessarily agree with that, but the markets determined that that was the right way to go and the burn instruction occurred. As soon as we finalized it, the tokens went poof.
00:30:55.536 - 00:30:58.488, Speaker A: Do you think that governance decision was correct?
00:30:58.664 - 00:31:16.592, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, like, I think the fundamental point becomes that you've got tons of flexibility in daos, right. It doesn't mean that, like, this is a one way door with a lot of things. So you can create a new token, you can migrate to a new token, you could create an elastic supply token.
00:31:16.656 - 00:31:17.072, Speaker A: Sure.
00:31:17.176 - 00:31:46.336, Speaker B: So I think that short term thinking and motivation there may have been right, may have been correct in one way shape or form or you just have enough people that are participating in these markets. Like we kind of said with bubbles, you may have imperfect information, but it doesn't necessarily mean that, you know, like, you closed a door and you can't go through another one with it, but there could be decisions that are made that you can't, you know, you can't undo as easily. Right.
00:31:46.368 - 00:31:47.200, Speaker A: Like burns.
00:31:47.320 - 00:31:47.760, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:47.840 - 00:31:48.128, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:48.184 - 00:32:26.104, Speaker B: So, so, um, you know, trading. Trading proposals where people were underpricing the reward and so they would get more tokens than they should have if they just took their money to spot. And we saw high activity with those proposals and even contentious activity, which was interesting because arguably, having Pantera as an investor would have been something that was really good, but the amount of discount was deemed unfit. Right. Like, unpalatable by people that were holding tokens or trading the markets.
00:32:26.232 - 00:33:06.990, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so this is, this is a great example because there's a lot of general market unhappiness on when investors get access to deals at below market rate. Often those things come with long locks or simply securities law doesn't allow that to happen. But, like, I think the experts would say that those deals are net positive for the networks themselves, that they either provide useful capital at a point when that didn't exist. Right. There's all these sorts of components that go into this or that. The lock discounts that people get are proportional to some sort of timescale.
00:33:06.990 - 00:33:29.660, Speaker A: That seems like a situation where maybe the wisdom of the crowd actually led protocol astray. So two questions. One is, why do you think they didn't trade? And if they had, would that have been market manipulation? Would that have been felt undue by the community? How do you handle those situations where someone is participating in a market where they are the economic benefactor?
00:33:29.740 - 00:33:38.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's two minds of it. First is this was the burgeoning of the development of futarchy on chain.
00:33:38.580 - 00:33:38.844, Speaker A: Sure.
00:33:38.892 - 00:34:02.026, Speaker B: So I think we just didn't have a ton of market participants or sophisticated participants. So. So I'll chalk part of that up to that. Um, I would say that, like, general retail traders maybe have a sore spot about venture capital being investors and things. Um, but then also, like, just to. Just to get to your point about, you know, shouldn't pantera have traded that proposal?
00:34:02.098 - 00:34:02.466, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:02.538 - 00:34:07.688, Speaker B: And they. Arguably, they could have, up to the point of, like, it's a net loss for them.
00:34:07.744 - 00:34:08.120, Speaker A: Yes.
00:34:08.200 - 00:34:33.680, Speaker B: Right. So you could say, okay, well, our target price is actually $800 a token, and we're going to get it for 400. If this proposal passes. So we can technically trade up to 799, 799, but not a dollar more. Right. But if you create this incentive structure where you do have to deploy that capital, that capital is risk. It does create an effective alignment.
00:34:33.680 - 00:35:29.546, Speaker B: And then you're still saying like, this could, this could fail at any time as well. Right? Because if we're not trading the fail market or we're not participating in it. So I think that there's some nuance in understanding how the, how these markets interact with one another. Yeah, but I, I don't see a reason why that wouldn't be part of feud target governance in the, in the future where you do effectively say, I'm going to do, I'm going to split the difference here, right? Like maybe my target price is something different or even a hostile event where the founder is saying I want to take $10 million, right, and they're willing to trade up to $9 million because they net out 1 million. But in effect, you've had to prop up that price. And people, if this decision was to occur, were able to exit at a very favorable price because of your efforts and energies. Right.
00:35:29.546 - 00:35:46.030, Speaker B: Because they may disagree fundamentally with it. Whereas right now, if you disagree with the governance vote, what can you do? You just sell your governance token and you may not get a good execution price, but if somebody's trying to actively manipulate these markets in doing so, they have to give you a good exit price.
00:35:46.190 - 00:36:03.060, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny because I think the place that a lot of people, including myself, kind of like get stuck on is, well, you are just sort of paying for votes at some point. I know these are not technically votes, but you are, uh, you are buying an outcome.
00:36:03.360 - 00:36:07.144, Speaker B: You could be, but the, the thing is, is rich people like to stay rich.
00:36:07.272 - 00:36:07.648, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:07.704 - 00:36:25.176, Speaker B: And they're rich for a reason. So that, you know, like you, you can only buy so many because your capital is at risk each time. Right? So effectively you buying is you selling, and then if you look at the risk parameters of you acquiring all the token, at some point you acquire all the token and then what's the value?
00:36:25.288 - 00:36:25.976, Speaker A: Sure, totally.
00:36:26.008 - 00:36:36.010, Speaker B: Right. Like so, so you are incentivized and even yourself as a large holder is incentivized distribution because you want to at least spread out some risk on that.
00:36:36.090 - 00:36:36.378, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:36.434 - 00:36:54.336, Speaker B: So I think it creates these really unique incentives that you don't really think about until you start playing around with the markets where you're like actually tons of team token. Doesn't make sense because then the community has no incentive to trade or really think about these things, and I think you get some interesting balances.
00:36:54.458 - 00:37:11.268, Speaker A: Yeah, that is interesting. So I want to get into the tooling. You guys have actually built on chain on Solana today. So if people want to participate in metadata, like, walk me through that. But also, if someone's like, I kind of want to take this and use it on my project. What is the state of that tooling today?
00:37:11.364 - 00:37:57.510, Speaker B: Yeah, so recently. Let's see, back in March, so we were in Mountain Dow, February. I mean, that was just the explosion of all this. And I credit profit, my co founder with that because he'd sit down next to somebody and be like, have you heard of futurkey? Have you heard of. Eventually it just spread across the whole event? But, yeah, in March, we put up a proposal for $96,000 to build out futurkey as a service. So create a platform where we could do multi dao, where they could be tenants on the smart contract, and then they could effectively use feed target governance. So that was launched in the 21 May.
00:37:57.510 - 00:38:23.906, Speaker B: So we completed that in a little under eight weeks. And now any Dao can go and, you know, contact us. We've got a little. We've got gated front end for right now because we don't necessarily want anybody just creating ten drift dials. We want to be able to have some modicum of control right now for this stuff until other stuff comes on chain. But, uh, yeah, anybody. We're.
00:38:23.906 - 00:38:40.810, Speaker B: We're more than happy to. To spearhead the launch of daos. Uh, few target daos for people. The Dao gets created. The DAO has a treasury, and then you can execute instructions according to that daos, treasury or anything else you need that's afforded from that. And that's. That's on chain.
00:38:40.810 - 00:38:49.828, Speaker B: That's live right now. We've been running it with, uh, four daos, including ourselves, as tenants. So that's been really exciting to see Dean's list, Dao, future dao and then drift as well.
00:38:49.924 - 00:39:08.860, Speaker A: Nice. So what do you think are. And we can limit this to kind of on chain stuff, but what do you think are some of the best potential applications for this and the ones where maybe the product market fit isn't quite as there? Like, if I'm a founder trying to evaluate if this is right for my project, how would I make that decision?
00:39:08.980 - 00:39:58.146, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, you know, as users become familiar with this, I think that this will be the status quo. That's just what I believe with it. I think it allows you to make effective decisions. And as a founder, in this space, you may not have access to all that information and you may be hesitant to make, to make moves. And if it's effectively decentralized, and in this case, it absolutely certainly is like, this is, this is not questionable whether like, you have insiders or teams that retain a majority, could control. I think that you get a lot of unique benefits from that that people will make sense of as far as, like, practical applications. We've seen the interest of daos that want to run their grants program with it, and I think that that is certainly something that has an effective.
00:39:58.258 - 00:40:05.400, Speaker A: What about technical decisions? Do you think this is a good model to make? Like SIMD, something like that?
00:40:05.740 - 00:40:56.142, Speaker B: You know, like, it's interesting because I think the current implementation doesn't satisfy what we would need to do, which would be additional metrics, not price. Because how would you move the price to Solana with this? And in many cases you need to make technical decisions that may not move that. Right. But I think if you boil it up and you say, well, is jump plus Anza at a five to three ratio allocated the decision making capacity, is that going to drive Solana forward? If you say that that's the proposal, and then you assign the responsibility to those parties, then you probably have a good proposal and you probably can use a few target governance to make these decisions. So it may not be simd level, but what you could do is you can afford to say who should the team be, right.
00:40:56.166 - 00:41:00.062, Speaker A: So like. Like who should be core contributors to the network.
00:41:00.166 - 00:41:12.994, Speaker B: Yeah. And say you could have all different kinds of constraints with that. But I think that that's where you could probably start to say that will move the price in one way or another, and you could use that as a fundamental base.
00:41:13.082 - 00:41:52.348, Speaker A: Yeah. So last question, kind of a more philosophical question on this, which is like, however you want to use the term populist, woke, whatever, how would you prevent this from getting captured by sort of social sentiment. Right. Like in the us form of governance, there are checks and balances that are in place. And those checks and balances, sometimes they're very slow. Right. Supreme Court does not move quickly, but often it will correct things that, for lack of a better terms, the public has gotten wrong.
00:41:52.348 - 00:42:20.698, Speaker A: And you can disagree with the Supreme Court decision, but like, I, primarily what they're doing is they're stepping in and saying, based on our expertise, Congress got this wrong, the legislature got this wrong, the lower courts got this wrong. How does that sort of work in a model like this? Or how would you sort of safeguard it from some sort of rise to power of a group that has a certain idea.
00:42:20.794 - 00:42:58.226, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm going to go back to Robin Hanse's paper because he talks about this where effectively he says, well, let's create futures contracts for bad decisions in the future that would pay out. So effectively you could have people trading those markets that would then counterbalance in some mechanism or design for profit so that you could revert decision making. If this passes a certain threshold of price, then the decisions reverted. So you can create, I think what you end up doing is creating economic constructs that effectively do it. But he highlights that you don't want to remove legislature. Right.
00:42:58.226 - 00:43:09.554, Speaker B: But what you may want to do is constrain what they, what they afforded the capacity to do in this decision making process. Right. So you, you probably still have systems of checks and balances.
00:43:09.682 - 00:43:10.034, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:10.082 - 00:43:45.544, Speaker B: You probably still use markets for that. But effectively you're just reconstructing a system that leverages what we've already known with legal and regulatory capture. And you say they still have a role to play in this because somebody still needs to send the police to a door or needs to make sure that there's not lead and gasoline. Right. But at the end of the day, what they're allowed to do from their independent decision making is constrained. And I think that that's the important bit. But you do run into these issues of, like, what happens if the decision is made to eliminate all humans on earth.
00:43:45.544 - 00:44:01.616, Speaker B: You can't go back from that. Right. So there are these extremes where this starts to break down, but you probably have that breakdown anyway with nuclear stalemates and everything else, whereas mutually surged self destruction, you're like, well, we can't go back from that when that happens either.
00:44:01.728 - 00:44:12.918, Speaker A: Right. Interesting. Well, if people want to learn more, if they want to potentially look at applying this to their own project, how can they get in touch? Where should they go to learn more?
00:44:12.974 - 00:44:39.664, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can, you can visit Futarchy, metadao fi or Metadao fi and you can get there. We have plenty of buttons and links that you can click to get into Google forms and other places. You can reach out to profit and I on Twitter. So metanalic Nallok. And then profit is metaprofit with a three instead of an e in profit. So, ah, we're happy to, to do that.
00:44:39.664 - 00:44:43.072, Speaker B: Our discord is discord slash metadow.
00:44:43.176 - 00:44:46.128, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Colin, thank you for joining us today on validated.
00:44:46.184 - 00:44:47.560, Speaker B: Well, thanks for having me. This was great.
