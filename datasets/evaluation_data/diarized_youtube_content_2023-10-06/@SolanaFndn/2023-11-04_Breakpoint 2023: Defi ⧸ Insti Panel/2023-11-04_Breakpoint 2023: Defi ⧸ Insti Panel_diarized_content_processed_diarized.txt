00:00:01.200 - 00:00:05.878, Speaker A: So we have a very relevant panel today. So I just want to start off by just having you guys introduce yourselves.
00:00:06.006 - 00:00:49.714, Speaker B: Sure. Awesome. Great to be here. Sharvan here from Saison Capital. I currently help to lead crypto for Credit Saison, which is like one of the largest japanese financial institutions, where we are pretty much known for being the largest credit card company in Japan in terms of usage and transaction volume. And then we also have a b, two b wholesale lending division where we kind of lend out to different banks, non banking lenders, quite a few tech unicorns that have had like, an embedded fintech business. So we helped create Grab Financial, amongst many other names in Southeast Asia, India, and, well, a bit of East Asia, which was like a $10 billion unicorn, like just a span of three months.
00:00:49.714 - 00:00:56.834, Speaker B: And. Yeah, super excited to be here. And we are exploring a lot of cool stuff in crypto right now.
00:00:57.794 - 00:00:58.530, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:00:58.682 - 00:01:21.774, Speaker C: I'm Shane Molidar. I'm the CEO and founder of forged. Forged is a web based platform. It's a toolkit to help project founders optimize token and protocol performance. Free to use public good for anyone building on Solana. I've been working professionally in crypto for about eight years. So prior to founding forged, I was the CEO of a major centralized exchange.
00:01:21.774 - 00:01:36.666, Speaker C: Prior to that, I operated a cryptocentric market making operation out of China at FPG Capital, and then started my crypto journey back in 2015 working at Gemini, the US based compliant exchange founded by the Winkleboss twins. But really great to be here.
00:01:36.770 - 00:01:52.682, Speaker A: Yeah, see? Incredibly relevant. So let's start off on the base layer of this. What are some of the main considerations that institutions and tradfi have when they're considering deployment of capital on an l one like Solana?
00:01:52.818 - 00:02:34.894, Speaker B: Sure. I guess the first step always begins off chain. It's never on chain. The ETF developments have been pretty interesting, to say the least. But apart from that, you need more institutions to basically get more involved with the different mega funds in the ecosystem and be able to lend to them, borrow, lend out to different protocols in the ecosystem. And then after that, you kind of get more deeply embedded into ecosystem where you can have more tradfis come in, the Solana defi, for example, and just kind of use it like normally with different crypto wallets. But I guess before all that, it definitely matters.
00:02:34.894 - 00:03:38.878, Speaker B: Like different ecosystems have. Like, what we mainly care about is developers is one thing for sure, but it needs to be something new, right? Like, you can't just do the same copycat businesses all the time. And there just needs to be a different variety of different applications where we can actually do different partnerships with some of these applications and kind of create a different ecosystem for it oneself. And then obviously the technological metrics for the chain does matter a lot. It needs to be credibly neutral, it needs to be fast and cheap, because that's the main value add benefit for a blockchain, to be honest, at least from an Fi's perspective, because most FIS have a pretty poor cost to income ratio. And we tested like over 60 blockchains. And we came to the conclusion that blockchains kind of basically reduce costs on the back end, at least from 8% to 34%, which is quite massive.
00:03:38.878 - 00:03:55.564, Speaker B: And the main variable here that we found was mainly just gas. And just in general, like the block time in general is like, at the end of the day, we want to be backing applications on, you know, we don't want to back dial up applications, we want to back fiber optics applications.
00:03:56.624 - 00:04:39.544, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I'll maybe take a different perspective. And like, you know, first, when I think of the institutional wave of crypto, I really, you know, differentiate between like, institutional capital allocators and then institutional trading institutions. Institutional capital allocators. If they're going to deploy capital into the secondary market, they need to see a liquid, vibrant marketplace. They don't want to be bag holders, they don't want to get their faces melted off as they try to exit a position because there's no bid side liquidity on the other side of the market. And they don't want the market to rip as they're looking to build up a bullish position. So they won't enter the secondary market unless they're institutional, high frequency market makers already active within the ecosystem.
00:04:39.544 - 00:05:19.824, Speaker C: So when we think about like, how do we get those institutional market makers? You have to remember, no one provides liquidity from an altruistic perspective. They seek to profit first and foremost. What allows them to profit? Retail order flow. So the base layer needs a vibrant retail community in order to attract that institutional grade liquidity. So that's really the cornerstone of building up liquidity in Defi for any sort of base layer, whether it's Solana, whether it's EVM, or whether it's one of the new high performant layer ones or L2s that is entered into the market. And I think that's a big question on everyone's mind, whether you're building primitives or dapps in the space.
00:05:20.444 - 00:05:38.544, Speaker A: Yeah. So we've talked a lot about the signals and the things that they need to have in place. But there's also a lot of other descriptions that exist. Can we talk a little bit about some of the incentive programs or things that can kind of de risk their initial plays onto deFi?
00:05:39.074 - 00:06:07.094, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So I think we've seen a lot of great incentive programs on DeFi applications thus far, especially in the last six months. So there's been a lot of focus on the point reward system for Marginfi. They had an explosive growth within TVL. Also drift has made a really astounding recovery since Q two of last year. And some of the market turbulence that they experienced. I mean the TVL that they've experienced is fantastic.
00:06:07.094 - 00:06:57.500, Speaker C: The growth of the TVL for both of those applications I think is directly applicable to their incentive system. So Marginfi had their fantastic more viral point reward system encouraging not only deposits but actually people borrowing from the protocol. This was I think, more retail and pseudo institutional centric, whereas drift has gotten astounding feedback from institutional grade market makers based on their market maker and liquidity incentive program. These are both different initiatives to sort of increase and provide this foundational layer of activity that then allows other to enter into seamlessly. And you know, that catalyzes this virtuous feedback loop of liquidity, begets liquidity trade volume, begets more trade volume and serves as a great marketing tool in and of itself.
00:06:57.652 - 00:07:35.778, Speaker A: Now I've heard a lot about the various point systems where you can kind of signal to the market some fun less. It's not live liquid at day one and that gives you some agency to iterate on what exactly your tokenomics are. So you can learn the way your community is interacting with you in a more fun, less immediately serious environment, but still very clearly signaling to the market that there's a wider ecosystem at play. Can you maybe describe some of the variations you've seen on point systems and what's kind of like worked and not worked thus far? Obviously it's all very new, but yeah, what you've seen, yeah, absolutely.
00:07:35.826 - 00:08:17.316, Speaker C: So I think what you're referring to is when you have a tokenomics or your supply side tokenomics finalized. So both your token distribution schedule so who's set to receive tokens and then your emissions model. So how and at what rate will tokens enter into circulation? That's codified, it's memorialized on chain. Once you set it you can't iterate on it. The great thing about a testnet or an incentivized testnet with a point reward system is that it's sort of funny money. You're not distributing any quantity of tokens. It's basically we'll distribute points, and then it's a pro routed distribution of an airdrop token to whoever holds the most points at the end of the incentivized testnet.
00:08:17.316 - 00:08:58.354, Speaker C: So I think we're seeing more and more deFi protocols getting really, really creative with the manner in which they provide those points. So some things are basic deposit assets into a concentrated liquidity pool. I've spoken with certain Dex protocols that are looking to launch on Solana that have much more creative things, such as a retroactive refund. If you're on the wrong side of a trade and your p and l is net negative. Those are exciting things to get people to actually put on a trade, get past that initial hurdle, and become an active participant within the protocol. You create a great user experience. Maybe you'll have a sticky brand, they'll stick around even after they're being incentivized.
00:08:59.494 - 00:09:19.566, Speaker A: Something that really reminded me of some games I know that have really screwed up some of their initial token offerings, their third generation, and each time they had to make this really hand wavy reason to mint the second and then the third token after they like, inflated too much or whatever they might have done. So, yeah, point systems are really helpful.
00:09:19.630 - 00:10:19.746, Speaker B: I kind of have, like opposing views on that because I do agree that some protocols have seen like an explosive growth due to the incentive system. But, you know, we have seen this and even other L2 ecosystems, like Zksync, for instance. But you may have like more TBL coming in, but at the end of the day, if that, you can have $1 trillion. But if that TVL is not being used and it's just being put out there like a lazy TVL, and you just hand out incentives, it's like super unsustainable for the protocol, I think, because it is like a pretty sizable chunk of the overall tokenomic supply that is being passed on to users and which they probably just dump it, I think. And that being said, I mean, if you look at Solana right now, before the whole token hypes, I think. I think Solana still had like one of the highest capital efficient chains. I think, number one, like, I think it was like every dollar, it was like $1.50.
00:10:19.746 - 00:11:15.604, Speaker B: And even ecosystems like Arbitrum were at TBL, which basically says there are great products on Solana and people are using it just for the sake of using it, and not just like airdrop farming. And I think we should be focused more on those aspects instead of the incentive side, because we have seen, I'm not going to name out the chains, but you have these chains spending $20 million or whatever, and then the results from that was obviously pretty poor. I think it was just two transactions from spending 20 mil on a pretty big web to collect company as well. So it will just matter more on getting real enterprise partnerships coming in. So I would go more of a b, two b, two c route because clearly since the start of the industry we have tried the retail route all the way and that has not worked out.
00:11:16.624 - 00:11:59.064, Speaker A: So you mentioned a little bit about capital efficiency there. A different type of efficiency that DeFi obviously brings is 24/7 markets all around the world. But I want to talk a little bit about some of the frictions there. Certain jurisdictions and certain regulatory environments are preventing that vision to be able to come into place. Can we talk a little about what is available today? Not waiting for any major policy changes, but what kind of strategy have you seen within this crazy environment? How to ship and what is the best practices to get what we can in terms of institutions in certain, is it region based or certain strategies that we can see today?
00:11:59.404 - 00:12:56.714, Speaker C: Yeah, I think DeFi has democratized access to mid sized institutions on an unprecedented basis. So you see the emergence of quant shops comprised of four or five individuals that are trading the same size and scale and at the same same frequency time as a lot of the major HFT desks from tradfi. So when centralized exchanges and fiat was most dominant, back. Sound like a boomer saying this. When I was at Gemini in 2015, you had to have the banking relationships, you had to have the fixed direct connect or great access to restful in order to be a dominant player on book. When amms really started taking the world by storm, a lot of these on chain cypherpunks actually became the fastest traders in the market. They were able to profit quite aggressively during the DeFi summer and build up their tech stack to the point where they were comparable to some of the big players in the space.
00:12:56.714 - 00:14:03.064, Speaker C: And, you know, household names like Wintermute, for example, weren't always the giants that they are today, but now they're in many ways seen as a synonymous, you know, whale in the same conversations as the likes of jump trading, Hudson river trading, tower research, two sigma, et cetera. So I think it benefits to be small and agile. And while I don't want to put words in the mouths of these small agile operations, I think that the bloat that you experience from an oversized compliance department, a risk department can sort of hamstring you in being first to market more than ever. What we're seeing now, I think after the regulatory crackdown following FTX collapse, is the fear of look through liability, which is essentially, you may have an offshore entity, but we're the decision makers and wear their boots on the ground. So the regulators have the ability to look through the offshore entity and see where the decision's being made. If you're a us citizen directing those decisions. Well, there is a very fluid regulatory environment, and I think everything we've seen thus far shows that it's a draconian approach to crypto.
00:14:03.064 - 00:14:07.344, Speaker C: So it pays not to be in the US, and it pays to have a small, agile team.
00:14:08.604 - 00:14:25.908, Speaker A: Quick plug. We decided Solana foundation to sign an MoU with UAE for basically like a special economic zone for crypto founders, especially in the Solana ecosystem. You can find out more details on Twitter related to that topic.
00:14:26.036 - 00:15:01.952, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I guess in terms of different jurisdictions, I think for us, first and foremost, the most important one is the KYC on chain. Because without that, it's not that I think instead of want to serve customers without KYC, it's just that if we do that, we will go to jail. Right. And that's one of the main barriers right now. And I think a lot of the Defi Maxis obviously do not want to go through KYC. But that being said, they also need to be, like, quite a bit of privacy infrastructure in place, which we are still waiting to be seen, to be honest.
00:15:01.952 - 00:15:47.692, Speaker B: Because, again, that's also like, at least for Singapore and Japan, that's like a regulatory requirement that if you do not have different privacy infrastructures in place, you are not going to be allowed to do it. But that being said, there are quite a few large top five banks in the world that are doing things on chain, mainly like mortgage backed securities, securities on chain. But they're not doing, currently, they're not doing it on a public blockchain like Solana or something. They're mainly doing it on a subnet. A subnet right now. But don't think of it as a backwards step, because the main thing is to move on to a public blockchain because the cost does go down drastically. And these guys kind of jumped in from a private blockchain to a subnet.
00:15:47.692 - 00:15:54.514, Speaker B: So it's always like a pretty good step forward. And they're doing like $5 billion in a daily basis, which is like pretty sizable.
00:15:55.254 - 00:16:08.594, Speaker A: What, what would be like a macroeconomic trigger that you could see either like a regulation or some other. Yeah. Trigger that you could see, that would be a really big signal that we could all maybe even push for as an industry.
00:16:10.374 - 00:17:14.104, Speaker C: I mean, I think everyone has their eyes on the ETF approval right now, right? Like, that's like the, the crown jewel of institutional wave of crypto is saying if you have a approved, regulated product that reflects the cash market, not a future settled market for the most popular cryptocurrency in existence, that can kind of usher in more institutions that at first want to provide liquidity for the underlying do basket redemption and renewal, but then sort of permeates throughout, because again, once the institutions kind of have their foot in the door, it's all about profit maximization. Where can I maximize profit? How can I allocate my capital most effectively in order to get the best return? That is true whether or not you're trading your own principal capital, or if you're trading capital on behalf of LP's as a principal or institutional capital allocator. So I think that's like the biggest signal that people are looking out for a lot of other smaller, maybe Solana centric signals, but like, we can't ignore, you know, maturation of bitcoin markets.
00:17:14.444 - 00:18:01.190, Speaker B: I guess from my side, like, it would be more around. I mean, obviously the most obvious macro trend is the interest rate, but I think more than that, it's more about mindshare, for example. It's not related to Defi, but I think it's pretty relevant here because, for example, stepn, I think a lot of crypto natives may not like it because of tokenomics or whatever, but in Japan, like, a lot of the non cryptonative families are people. They kind of by step in and they're like, oh, this is so cool. I'm like a crypto native guy. They actually use it to brag. But you need more massive option in that way because even if you manage to get or sign an institution for your application, it's not going to matter if you have barely any users.
00:18:01.190 - 00:18:38.044, Speaker B: Otherwise, one firm is going to just try to go after the other. That's not going to be there for a long time. At the worst case scenario, they're just going to juice out all the token rewards from your side. So I would just focus more on getting more retail flow first, more than anything. So that kind of shows the institution that this is where people are going towards, because institutions at least like ours, kind of serve like a lot of the mass population, right. And strategy also relies on where people are going towards and if they are going towards any DeFi applications, then for sure we will accelerate all of our processes towards that.
00:18:38.344 - 00:19:05.304, Speaker A: Great. Another topic that comes up a lot in crypto, especially when you have these open platforms, is the line between something that's very collaborative and can be very competitive, is sometimes very thin or, you know, very nonlinear. So between tradfi and Defi, can you kind of just maybe discuss where they're completely collaborative, you know, where it might be extending the traditional finance industry, and where it might be just directly competitive?
00:19:05.884 - 00:20:04.948, Speaker C: Yeah, right. I mean, I've been super excited by some of the announcements from this conference alone, especially with sort of hybrid CFI, DeFi exchange marketplace, Xnft backpack launch, x Cube. I think these are sort of taking lessons learned from the lack of transparency that exists in c five, especially the collapse of FTX, while also acknowledging the shortcomings of decentralized exchanges and essentially saying, you can have it all. You can have proof of reserves, your assets, your keys, your crypto. You can still have high performant matching that can really only occur off chain, at least for the time being. So I think that's a great example of collaboration that sort of takes the best of both worlds. Up until now, I don't really think that we've been able to find any sort of purely on chain decentralized platform that can match the low latency, high performance that you get on a centralized exchange.
00:20:04.948 - 00:20:38.720, Speaker C: But obviously, when you deposit your assets to a centralized exchange, they're stored in a commingled omnichannel, a bus account. There's no transparency into the reserves. Any sort of delta between liabilities and assets is totally obfuscated to the end user. And therefore, there's a high degree of risk, a single point of failure that obviously hurt many of us in attendance at this conference. So I'm really excited about those developments, and I'm excited to see that Solana seems to be pioneering them. Because if you want speeds, Solana is where you gotta be.
00:20:38.872 - 00:20:39.648, Speaker A: That's great.
00:20:39.776 - 00:21:27.252, Speaker B: Awesome. Maybe I can give a perspective from more of the non banking lending side. So, for example, we have one of our debt and equity portfolio companies that will be soon launching in February on chain. So the background of these guys is they're like the third largest credit institution in Asia right now. I mean, they will obviously require a bit of KYC because otherwise they would kind of go to jail. But so they have like more than seven different licenses and one step closer to just being a bank. And they have already found, like, different synergies with DeFi protocols where you can basically use the tokens from these credit institutions, use it as collateral, and just, you know, carry on the game as you want it to be.
00:21:27.252 - 00:21:34.714, Speaker B: So like, that's like a pretty cool collaboration that we kind of saw like between regulated and unregulated entities.
00:21:35.854 - 00:22:00.000, Speaker A: So I'm sure not everybody in this audience is a Defi project. So say I'm just launching a normal app, say a deep end project, a social app or nfts. You still probably want traditional finance involved. What would be your recommendation to them to kind of appeal to traditional markets to be involved in their projects, like either liquidity or just any other aspects?
00:22:00.112 - 00:23:06.426, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one thing that I'm actually really excited about that I'm seeing more and more in the DeFi ecosystem is that projects are asking why token not when token, you see a lot more applications that are going live with a product, iterating on that product, finding true product market fit, then using a token issuance as a way to sort of pour gasoline on the fire, more incentives for retail and mid size institutions to get involved. We're seeing that with Dexs in this space letting in borrowing protocols, for example. And I think the lack of token as they're iterating on product market fit sort of takes the edge off. All the focus doesn't have to be on token price performance because price performance does matter of your token, it can kill the user experience. I know that's a taboo to talk about, but I'm encouraged of projects that are finding that product market fit using the token to further catalyze user adoption. Because the retail user adoption is the number one thing that's going to drive institutional adoption. Because that vibrant retail activity allows the institutions the opportunity to profit.
00:23:06.490 - 00:23:17.788, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean retail is just willing to pay for the service that the liquidity provides, providers provide. Yeah, I totally agree because that's where the profit margin will come from, I.
00:23:17.796 - 00:24:20.104, Speaker B: Guess from our side. So I can, I guess say based on like the singaporean regulation side. So for ours we just need to know, obviously like no undocument teams for us, that's like a big no for us. Like if you don't know who we are dealing with, that's like an easy pass. Secondly is we just need to know that, well, alluding to my previous point is there needs to be enough retail flow coming in and in a very sustainable manner without them basically doing like 30% of their overall tokens they just sent out to retailers and basically sent off a dumping. And then lastly is like in terms of regulatory stuff. I wouldn't really worry about it if you guys are looking to do something in Singapore, because if you manage to find like a regulated fi, like us in Singapore, and we are keen to collaborate with you, like licensing and everything is already sorted out because the regulators in Singapore have given a select few institutions that are pass to basically allow the institutions to work with any defi application that they want to.
00:24:20.404 - 00:24:35.364, Speaker A: Great. We're almost out of time here, but I just want to say, like, you know, in a prolonged bear, where there's like, good positive signals here, but obviously, like, prolonged negative signals here, do you have any, like, last minute advice for people as they kind of navigate this space between markets?
00:24:35.524 - 00:24:38.224, Speaker C: Keep chewing glass on retail?
00:24:40.244 - 00:25:13.554, Speaker B: I guess from our side, I'm definitely just, like, always trying to aim for a PMF, whether it comes or not. It is always a surprise whenever it comes to when we kind of saw with the early days of fintech, when fintech was actually considered illegal in Singapore and a lot of people were jailed at actually for it. But sooner or later, we did see a high degree of fintech actually grabbing market share from the traditional financial services, like grabbing more than 45% of the market share, which is pretty phenomenal. So just focus and just do what you want to do the best.
00:25:13.854 - 00:25:19.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for everybody and my wonderful panelists here to have this conversation today.
