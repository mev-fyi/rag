00:00:09.280 - 00:00:10.574, Speaker A: Welcome to the Solana podcast.
00:00:10.654 - 00:00:11.454, Speaker B: I'm Austin.
00:00:11.574 - 00:00:19.854, Speaker A: Today we're doing things a little different. For this episode, I'm joined by Amira, who's the policy lead at the Solana foundation. Great to have you co host this episode.
00:00:20.014 - 00:00:59.960, Speaker C: Thanks, Austin. Great to be here. Well, earlier this year, Austin and I received a very interesting invitation to spend a week in Greenland with a group of climate activists, blockchain industry leaders, NFT artists, and nonprofit veterans. The premise was to bring a bunch of people together who never talked to each other, put them face to face with destruction being caused by climate change, and find a space to work together. Austin and I weren't sure what to expect, but were both personally passionate about climate and wanted an opportunity to learn about how else the Solana foundation could lead in the space. Also, we were just curious what happens when you put Greenpeace in the room with someone who works at one of the biggest bitcoin pools in the world. Turns out it was pretty interesting.
00:00:59.960 - 00:01:45.744, Speaker C: The conversation today is with a couple of our fellow travelers, a Greenpeace activist and a man who until recently, worked for one of the world's largest bitcoin mining pools. Ralph Scar is a 15 year veteran of Greenpeace USA. His career spans living deep in the Amazon rainforest with indigenous tribes to advocating on behalf of the environment at the UN, and now figuring out what Greenpeace should do about blockchain. Daniel Huang is a true bitcoin og. He had his Tyler Durden moment in 2012 when he rage quit a law firm and began bitcoin mining in earnest. Most recently, he worked at Steakfish and f two pool, two of the world's largest mining and validator operators. And he's now one of the co founders of the blockchain infrastructure Carbon offset working group and validator Commons.
00:01:45.744 - 00:02:16.296, Speaker C: This episode is part of a broader series of climate episodes that we'll be doing on the podcast to shed light on work at the intersection of blockchain and climate change. It's a bit different from what we typically do on the Solana podcast, but thought it was important to use this platform to highlight the climate crisis and the role that the web3 community can play in it. Ralph and Daniel, thank you so much for being here. I'm so excited to get to co host the podcast with Austin. Ralph would love to learn from you. Tell us, what do you do? What is your job right now?
00:02:16.440 - 00:02:56.760, Speaker D: What do I do? Well, trying to save the planet, especially address the climate crises. I'm a little surprised to be here. I didn't think I'd be working, working on blockchain or bitcoin or any of this. But to give you a little background, Greenpeace and I, we start backwards from the big things we're trying to achieve. So for us right now, the number one priority is climate change. Maybe not surprisingly, and of all the things that we feel like we can contribute to address climate change, the number one thing is to phase out the use of fossil fuels and usher in a transition to clean and renewable energy sources. So for many years, I knew about bitcoin and crypto wasn't terribly well informed, but knew enough.
00:02:56.760 - 00:03:15.048, Speaker D: And then in recent years, as the energy consumption for proof of work, mining went up and up and up. And as miners moved from China to the US to restart coal plants and fossil fuel power plants, suddenly it was like entering my space, and it was something that we realized we'd have to engage on.
00:03:15.216 - 00:03:42.914, Speaker A: It's funny you describe bitcoin as something that popped up on your radar, because I think most people would say Greenpeace is something that occasionally pops up on their radar when there's some large demonstration or event that captures the public attention. How much of the organization's work is that kind of stuff that I think most people say, if you think of Greenpeace, you think of people protesting, maybe they're jumping off a building, they're doing something like that, versus how much of it is sort of the backroom standards of running an NGO?
00:03:43.534 - 00:04:24.423, Speaker D: Good question. Yeah, we're not crazy, but often we're known for civil disobedience. Nonviolent direct action is a big part of who we've been and who we are today. And we think it's an important tool for change making. If you look at just about any movement that's been successful over the years, peacefully breaking the law, to draw attention to problems and to push folks to do better is a big part of what we do day to day. No, I don't have my climbing harness on right now, and I'm not planning a nonviolent direct action, but in the right place at the right time, it can really help catalyze activism, it can attract attention, and it can disrupt business as usual, which is a big part of what we're struggling with today.
00:04:25.283 - 00:04:42.303, Speaker C: Daniel, let's go to you, because you, I think, have a really interesting story, the trajectory of bitcoin and blockchain more broadly and climate. So let's start with your story. When you, I believe, rage quit a law firm and started mining bitcoin, how did you get into the space.
00:04:43.664 - 00:05:14.850, Speaker B: I was working at a law firm. I think the biggest thing for me was I didn't want to put myself in a position that was maybe contributing to society, that maybe was a bit more negative. There was this case in 2012. It was like a congressional hearing with HSBC. They had been caught helping money launderers and terrorist financiers, which is funny, right? Because a lot of people say people use bitcoin for that. Now. I left, and it was sort of my.
00:05:14.850 - 00:06:00.058, Speaker B: I think I told you, Amira, it was like my Tyler Durden moment where I was like, okay, the financial system is too far gone. So my friend was like, hey, there's this thing called bitcoin. I know you want to, quote, unquote, burn down the banks. Let's do this. And so we just went all in, and we're like, this is rage against the machine. And there's a lot that happened till now, but to kind of tie it to the context here, I don't think I ever really thought about the environment in terms of the sort of consensus mechanisms and everything that's involved with consensus with bitcoin. I think as the cryptocurrency and specifically the bitcoin market cap and ecosystem has grown, there has been that sort of attention.
00:06:00.058 - 00:06:04.726, Speaker B: But, yeah, in the beginning, it was just about sort of the censorship resistance.
00:06:04.890 - 00:06:10.918, Speaker C: And most recently, you were at f two pool and steakfish. Can you tell us what those are and what you did there?
00:06:11.046 - 00:06:38.856, Speaker B: I've actually now resigned from both of them as of last week for ideological reasons, some of which may kind of overlap with what we talk about today. But, yeah, f two pool had been, for the longest time, the largest bitcoin mining pool in the world. And then steakfish, which is its sister company, is a proof of stake validators. I was heading the protocols team at stakefish and leading the special projects team at f two pool.
00:06:39.000 - 00:06:52.164, Speaker C: Ralph, you started touching on this, but tell me the point at which bitcoin, or maybe crypto, came across your desk. Where did it go from. Oh, I read about the news to, oh, man, this is something that we should really be concerned about.
00:06:52.824 - 00:07:48.894, Speaker D: Yeah, actually, a couple of years ago. So Greenpeace is a third party donation policy that applies globally, not only not governments and corporations, but what other sources of contributions will we not take in 2019? That was revised to say that energy intensive cryptocurrencies would be off the table for us. So Greenpeace USA took a contribution that was changed into us dollars from a donor that was bitcoin in 2014. And then after 2019, we realized there was a problem here with energy consumption, and so we didn't really want to touch it anymore in terms of our own contributions. So I was involved with some of that. And then late last year, there was a coalition of groups coming together and a funder that was talking about, we think we can make the impossible happen, and we need some folks to work on this, and they approach Greenpeace. Would you like to work on changing bitcoin's code? A lot of people are intimidated by that.
00:07:48.894 - 00:08:20.352, Speaker D: And to that we said, of course, we work on all kinds of crazy things. That's sort of what we do. We take on big projects. We have a vision that people tell us cannot possibly be made possible, and then we get to work on it. So early this year, we launched a change the code coalition with environmental working group and some local partners and have been pushing to, well, pushing bitcoin to do better. But mostly it's an invitation, quite frankly. We're not pro or anti bitcoin, which is strange for a lot of people in the space.
00:08:20.352 - 00:08:28.004, Speaker D: They're used to being tribal and fighting. And which side are you on? We're just inviting folks to collaborate with us to find systemic solutions.
00:08:29.144 - 00:08:48.004, Speaker C: I want to get to that in a sec to talk about the work that's done there. But before we move too far from the change the code coalition, I want to dig in more to your thoughts there, and maybe we just start to say, can you talk more about what the proposal is, Rolf, or how are you thinking of getting people to change the bitcoin code, what this looks like?
00:08:48.384 - 00:09:21.058, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a good question. We're used to working with companies or industries or governments, something where there's discrete and clear decision making, not a distributed ecosystem. So this is a new one for us. But at the same time, we believe that that invitation to collaborate, to come up with something new, it can apply to anybody. It can apply to an individual bitcoin enthusiast. It can apply to the big companies that have or are planning to invest in the business and to make a lot of money off of bitcoin. If you look at.
00:09:21.058 - 00:09:56.388, Speaker D: I know this is like a third rail for those in the bitcoin community, but financial asset managers and banks are getting in big, and I have nothing to do with that. But if they're going to do that, most of them have clear climate commitments. And so what can they bring to the table to identify the problems that would be involved in shifting bitcoin from business as usual proof of work to something new? Pow part two. Call it proof of useful work, call it something new. I dont think itll be what Ethereum just did. I think itll be something new. Im not the technical expert here, but I know that theres enough brains, theres enough money and creativity to make this happen.
00:09:56.388 - 00:10:23.560, Speaker D: And I think its kind of inevitable over time. Its hard to imagine that the system that was set up in 2009, if you think about the context here, with the climate crisis and everything else that's going to be coming at humanity, will be exactly the same in 1015, 2030, 40 or 50 years. Like at some point there'll be a transition, I believe, and the best transitions are ones that are like proactive and managed, not done in a crisis situation, like last minute.
00:10:23.712 - 00:11:05.004, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny because the first time I heard about this initiative was Twitter. Surprise, surprise. And the first way you see it is you see a lot of people tweeting, oh, this is a dumb idea. Greenpeace thinks there's a central company that runs the bitcoin code and they can just change the bitcoin code. Right. And that was the sort of the day one take on it. But, you know, even if that had been the approach, which was not the approach to it, it hits out something pretty profound, which is there's a lot of tautologies in blockchain, and one of them is, if no one's in charge of something, no one can change anything, which is very much not how it works.
00:11:05.084 - 00:11:05.516, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:05.620 - 00:11:43.556, Speaker A: This is one of those kind of funny instances where you can look at the bitcoin community and you can say, if enough people agree that we actually need to change some part of the core code of this to run on a different model, bitcoin is only valuable because everyone agrees that this code is the thing that this code is. And so if people start thinking, oh, actually, maybe it's time to change this code in a different way, that's no more or less valid than the current version of it that exists, and it doesn't require a central entity or even a central planning committee to say, oh, we are actually moving this code from one thing to another.
00:11:43.700 - 00:12:00.796, Speaker D: That's exactly right. And yeah, part of the initial response is you're dumb. You don't know what you're talking about. I've heard that before. I think there's a huge opportunity here. Another response was, you should just write your own code, then propose it today, then since it's open source and anyone can do it. Well, we're not that dumb.
00:12:00.796 - 00:12:31.534, Speaker D: We understand that what we're trying to do through this campaign, and I think we'll succeed longer term, is build the social consensus enough critical mass within the ecosystem to say, yeah, actually, we'd like that. And as with the 2017 shift in bitcoin, there was a bit of a fork. I had to expect that there'd be a fork with something like this. And I would also expect that the best or most popular version will thrive. And I think going forward, people are going to be more and more concerned about climate, not less.
00:12:31.654 - 00:13:24.790, Speaker B: So, Rolf, I was probably one of the guys. I didn't say it's dumb, but I remember when we were on a panel in Greenland, I was like, yeah, that's probably never going to happen. That was my gut reaction. That being said, especially with what Austin said and what you also reiterated, Rolf, is that social consensus is ultimately sort of like what ends up determining things. That was very clear even in the early days of crypto, or relatively early days of crypto, when Ethereum went through its hard fork into Ethereum and Ethereum classic, where there's like, you had these sort of die hards that said, code is law. I will admit I was one of those guys who was like, the code is law, Maxi. And I was on the side of Ethereum classic, but then quickly realized, and I wouldn't say it's from being jaded, but a chain is only as good as its community.
00:13:24.790 - 00:14:37.744, Speaker B: If no one is using the chain or no one values it or buys it, then that chain is dead, no matter how correct or ideologically aligned it is. And that you can probably say the same thing of bitcoin. And I would even say, and you were mentioning this earlier, Rolf, about how a lot of these global institutions want to have some sort of exposure to a potentially self sovereign currency. And maybe this part is a bit jaded of me, but if, for example, let's say we fork bitcoin and then transition it into a much less energy intensive mechanism, and all the banks in the world are like, okay, we're going to, we're going to adopt this form of bitcoin. So there's that group of people. There's also the die hard libertarian proof of work is the only way forward group of people. And then there's also, like, the people who use it day to day or speculate on it, that main, let's say, retail group of people that perhaps make up the majority of the users, as opposed to the small libertarian hyper POW supporters.
00:14:37.744 - 00:15:30.004, Speaker B: The retail, I think, would probably go with the adoption that they're going to get from institutions that support the non energy intensive consensus model, which would then say it perhaps aligns quite well with the initiatives that Greenpeace has naturally done with the social support. Right. And I'll change my answer from what we talked about on that panel in Greenland, that we could have a bitcoin that's much less energy intensive because it was, I wouldn't say forced, but because it was widely adopted. It's just adoption. Right. It's as simple as that. I officially changed my answer.
00:15:31.184 - 00:15:33.884, Speaker D: Daniels is full of announcements on this podcast.
00:15:34.424 - 00:15:58.384, Speaker C: So I have a question about this, which is the change to the code campaign says that we really only need 30 to 50 really highly involved stakeholders to actually change the code. Is that true tactically, what would it take from a pure stakeholder perspective, especially given what you just said, Danielle, which is. So the hardcore folks are probably going to be the last ones to leave proof of work.
00:15:59.404 - 00:17:11.995, Speaker D: Yeah, that's an attempt. That language is an attempt to show what happened in 2017 with bitcoin, where there's a small number of gatekeepers who actually virtually or in real life, I don't know the details, sat down to make a shift in bitcoin's code previously that it's not as if there's a vote of millions of people around the world, but I think to get to that point where code can be uptaken into the system, pushed out to nodes, et cetera, we do need the millions of people. We need the big players in the space, whether they're individual investors, mining pools, even the platforms that buy and sell bitcoin. And, yeah, some of these institutions that want increased exposure in the space to agree to create that sort of initial momentum to develop solutions. And so the big problems, this is the same, this is where bitcoin is the same as some of the other industries I've worked on, which is change won't happen unless you address the main concerns. Most industries that are polluting the climate don't want to change right now because x, y and z, well, let's name x, Y and Z. I think I have a sense of those things around decentralization and security and some other key issues.
00:17:11.995 - 00:17:49.204, Speaker D: And then let's try to figure out what are possible solutions to those things. If we're inventing something new, you're not just critiquing what's out there already, but you're looking forward and saying bitcoin changed the world once, it can probably do the same again. What are some creative and new ways to address those concerns so that no one has to pick between security and decentralization in a real way and this thing that they love. So the 30 is sort of a way to communicate that. In fact, that was sort of part of bitcoins history, that it can change. It has changed, and we believe it can again.
00:17:49.944 - 00:18:25.348, Speaker A: Yeah. So when you're looking at how we can change code again. So first off, I love the code is law thing, because if law was law, we wouldn't have anywhere near as many lawyers as we do. So the idea that somehow code being, I mean, you could say code is absolute, code is religious law, maybe, but you have code being law, it doesn't really solve many of our problems here. The piece that I think is so challenging here is the question about what the future of bitcoin is. Right. Bitcoin is the last major proof of work protocol out there.
00:18:25.348 - 00:19:16.104, Speaker A: There's some other things that run on proof of work, but they're not particularly interesting. And I don't think anyone's thinking about them as being a major component of a world economic system. The future of bitcoin is a very interesting one because it also is the only chain that doesnt have smart contracts on it. It lacks a lot of the programmability that other chains have had. And I think a lot of the proponents of bitcoin would say the point of bitcoin is that it doesnt change. And so the ask to be made here, I think its one of those ones where the blatant self interest is potentially the most powerful lever here to push either Daniel or Rolf. What do you see as those levers to actually make folks look at this and say, not I want to do this the environment, but I want to do this for my own economic self interest?
00:19:17.724 - 00:20:06.220, Speaker B: I think economic self interest is probably the biggest point. So when I started mining bitcoin, I wasn't necessarily in it for the money because it didn't cost anything. I was just doing it as a statement of, we're going to replace the banks, let's contribute to it. I'm hooking up my machines as part of this global network. Nowadays it's very different, mostly because the costs have gone up so much, because the price of bitcoin has gone up so much. But the key there is that good behavior, according to the bitcoin system of a miner, contributes by downloading the software, running the software, and then contributing to that block building process. Their good behavior is incentivized.
00:20:06.220 - 00:20:58.556, Speaker B: It's not reliant on any sort of altruism because they get paid. And I would even go as far as to say that many miners and large scale mining farms, they don't give a shit about decentralization or self sovereignty or censorship resistance or corruption resistance. They only care about getting paid money for the bitcoin. Thats obviously valuable to others. Thats, I think, the most fascinating part about human psychology or organization psychology you can depend on with high probability certain organizations and entities to behave in a certain way because theyre getting paid, not because youre in their favor. And then altruism is going to rule out. You get into this sort of prisoner's dilemma that oftentimes people are sometimes selfish.
00:20:58.556 - 00:21:35.804, Speaker B: So if we can define good behavior in such a way and we can create certain incentives to support that good behavior, where it does involve like a win win, then maybe that is one of the paths that we can take. But it's not for lack of interests, but it's perhaps the incentive and how that mechanism has been designed. We just need to have someone come up with a way or a system or a mechanism that does kind of point them in the right direction. Hold the carrot in front of the donkey. Even though the donkey doesn't want to go that way. It will go that way eventually.
00:21:37.184 - 00:21:58.420, Speaker C: Ralph, I'm sure this is all you've been thinking about, right? Because a lot of what you've done throughout your career is figure out sort of where these pressure points are and understand how to maximally leverage them in a lot of ways and often create some really fun pr campaigns that get traction out of them, too. So how do you think about this issue? How do you think about changing incentives in bitcoin land to incentivize changing the code?
00:21:58.572 - 00:22:37.462, Speaker D: Yeah, there's two sets of incentives. One is just the way that proof of work, mining works, which is different than other technologies I've worked on, like data centers. Google doesn't want to pay for more electricity than it needs to, and if it can, it would love to be more and more efficient. There's a built in financial incentive to get more efficient over time, even if usage goes up. The way that proof of work manifests in the world is kind of the opposite. I don't know of another technology that works like that where the more it's used and not only does it go up, but the incentive is to use more and more electricity, not less. And there's projections are projections.
00:22:37.462 - 00:23:25.266, Speaker D: But I'm concerned not only about where things are now, but where they would go if bitcoin were to scale up to the level of ambition that a lot of folks who are enthusiasts about bitcoin wanted to go to supplant the US dollar. Then that curve of electricity consumption starts to look almost unfathomable. It's clear that that can't match with a livable climate. I just wanted to call out that incentive. Fundamentally, that's what we're trying to do, is shift the incentives within the system around that sort of behavior that we believe doesn't match with the urgency of the climate crisis in terms of motivating people. Yeah, money's a big one. I mean, money's a big one, and we're not going to rely on people's quote unquote, altruism, although I think the lines are starting to blur.
00:23:25.266 - 00:24:13.356, Speaker D: Like, I don't think of appealing to people's altruism so much as appealing to people's self interest. And I live in California, where I've been here for 15 years, and I've seen the difference. Smoke filled skies for weeks on end. Folks in the Gulf coast states, people in Puerto Rico, people in Pakistan, suddenly this isn't about altruism. This is kind of about a livable present and a livable future. A lot of the conversations we had in the environmental movement in the past talked a lot about your kids and your grandkids, and now it's really shifted to, it's actually about us right now. And so I think the financial incentives and self interest again, are starting to really align in a way that should motivate people to embrace this change.
00:24:13.356 - 00:24:28.404, Speaker D: So it depends on the audience. If we're talking to companies that are engaged in bitcoin business and they have climate commitments, they've got to square this up. They've got to figure out how that matches so that their words are not empty and they're not called out for being part of greenwashing.
00:24:28.524 - 00:24:51.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm actually really curious. What was the feedback? I'm sure you've reached out to companies like Fidelity that have added bitcoin to iras and done that sort of work that you do in addition to this, what is the feedback been and how has the response been from the institutional players that obviously are not creating bitcoin, but they are intricately involved in the custodying and the transferring of the asset?
00:24:52.404 - 00:25:29.818, Speaker D: Yeah, they're in stage one, which is denial. So I'll share that. Not details, but just let you know that fidelity investments doesn't really want to talk about the issue. And it's clear that they may not have either a sense that there's enough of a business reason for them to engage with NGO's or on this issue or they don't know what they think about it yet. I'm not sure how to interpret that lack of wanting to talk. That's not unusual. We usually start in that place with institutions and then as they hear from customers, as they get more pressure, we hope that they'll want to collaborate.
00:25:29.818 - 00:26:01.026, Speaker D: They don't have to talk to me. This isn't some personal thing where I need them to talk to me, but to engage on the issue in a subject. Because we think that if youre offering bitcoin as an investment to everyone in the US that you offer 401 ks to that could potentially drive the price up. Youre going to be profiting from that. And we think that therell be a straight line connection to the associated carbon emissions. So right now, yeah, its a lot of sort of like ignoring the problem. And so thats where advocacy comes in.
00:26:01.026 - 00:26:07.664, Speaker D: Thats where mobilizing people power comes in to let them know that actually this is something they simply have to pay attention to.
00:26:09.204 - 00:26:30.812, Speaker C: And Daniel, I'm mindful of time, but I know that some of the work you're doing with the blockchain infrastructure climate working group is aimed around looking at these incentives. You're thinking about how we can work from the blockchain community to make sure that infrastructure is cleaner. I'm zooming out beyond bitcoin and more into blockchain more broadly, but can you tell us what that group does and a bit about it?
00:26:30.908 - 00:27:32.118, Speaker B: The working group basically started of, I was like, let's round up infrastructure providers, let's do measurements, figure out how to calculate emissions for all the infrastructure service providers, these validators, the mining pools, then go to chains. There's this NFT project that does ratings called fungi proof that I think rename described. They were doing actual level transaction level analysis on the emissions for nfts and those collections because the NFT market was pretty hot back then and we finished that and we open sourced them all in a GitHub repo. And then we were like, okay, we have a group of people. And it was less than ten people at the time because Klimadao had not launched yet. And it was all the climate people who were involved in crypto in one group, Klimadao and Toucan were part of that and they launched. And then that summer it was just like everyone was trying to do climate projects on crypto and then we were like, okay, now we can organize.
00:27:32.118 - 00:28:07.924, Speaker B: I really do think that one of the most important value adds that blockchain tech and the speculative part of crypto and the excitement that it brings is that innovation space where you can have a lot of really of cool products and companies and organizations and piece them together to figure out a way of solving some of these more difficult and intractable climate issues that we've been dealing with. Carbon credits come to mind as one example that has been taking off.
00:28:08.504 - 00:28:55.304, Speaker C: It wasn't until pretty recently, honestly, that I realized there was such a big group of folks at the intersection of blockchain and climate. And I learned so much about sort change of this space via these folks. And one of the things that came out of Greenland was like, wow, there's a lot of meat here, there's a lot of work to do, but there's a lot of vibrancy in the space. And Ralph, I just want to ask you, what do you make of blockchain people? I feel like you've probably gone through a journey where you get into the bitcoin world, you hear a lot of people talk about saving the world. What's your take at this point, after spending a bunch of time with people in the space, how much of it is, in your estimation, real and interesting, or what parts are real and interesting and maybe what parts do you think are people just maybe patting themselves in the back but not doing much?
00:28:55.844 - 00:28:56.156, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:56.180 - 00:29:31.454, Speaker D: What do I think of blockchain people? Well, a lot like everyone else, I've tried to tell people that this isn't just a bunch of Bros in Silicon Valley, and that seems to be very true. There's folks that come into the space from lots of different backgrounds and interests. It's very eclectic. I think people in general seem to be very passionate, which is good. They seem to be very intelligent, which is also good. And they seem to be very creative. So I like that sort of raw material in terms of the human capital here to apply to some of the biggest challenges that humanity is facing.
00:29:31.454 - 00:30:06.468, Speaker D: People are self interested. Sometimes people get attached to the thing they're working on, the thing that is their source of income and the rest of it. But that's no different than any other industry. And I think there's a lot of folks who are genuinely concerned about climate change, for example. And there's some that I met at Greenland who clearly we might have some differences of opinion. Like I'm not sure, not convinced that offsets will save the world, that not opposed to offsets, but they're sort of what you do after you've done everything else. Like, you know, you transition, you reduce your emissions by as much as actually possible.
00:30:06.468 - 00:31:10.336, Speaker D: Not just what you think is politically possible in the moment, the small p there, and then you can add offsets on top of that. But just sort of saying we're carbon neutral because we paid for someone else to do the work, that doesn't add up. We need both. We need both real world emissions reductions, especially from fossil fuels, and then we can add funding for good projects, regeneration, all the rest of it. What makes me interested is not only, as I mentioned before, like the opportunity to avoid a whole lot of future emissions by shifting bitcoin away from the current way of doing things in terms of validation, but stuff that's not credits. It seems like blockchain is really well suited to deal with credits and monetary transactions, but you have big companies like Walmart that are talking about engaging all of their suppliers to contribute to gigatons of climate reductions. And those supply chains are dizzyingly complex and full of a lack of transparency and go all the way back down to places where corruption and lack of transparency is encouraged for lots of reasons.
00:31:10.336 - 00:31:34.534, Speaker D: If blockchain tools could be used to shine a light on those supply chains that trace to all parts of the world and some truly sticky problems, and make verification and validation of climate positive practices more of a reality, that to me would outstrip all of the. All the credits that you'd want to try to buy or get on the marketplace in the coming years.
00:31:34.994 - 00:31:40.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to echo what Ralph was saying, like, the supply chain problem is probably one of the biggest.
00:31:42.074 - 00:31:56.058, Speaker C: This was such a fun conversation. I appreciate you being here. Before we sign off, just want to give you all 15, 20 seconds to plug something with the audience, something that you want them to look into or explore a little more or place you want to send them. Daniel, anything you want to plug.
00:31:56.226 - 00:32:05.114, Speaker B: Be less selfish and be more cognizant about the stakeholder. That's our planet. That definitely needs to stay in some of our decision making at all levels of society.
00:32:05.274 - 00:32:10.098, Speaker C: I love that. That's a great one. And Ralph, any last thing you want to plug?
00:32:10.226 - 00:32:26.970, Speaker D: Yeah, I just want folks to think of themselves as activists. Greenpeace is not in charge of the climate or the future of our planet. We're here to build people power and to work together. So go to cleanupbitcoin.com and greenpeace.org to get involved again. Support us in any way you'd like.
00:32:26.970 - 00:32:29.138, Speaker D: But mostly we'd love for you to be involved.
00:32:29.306 - 00:32:33.254, Speaker C: Thank you both so much. We really appreciate the time and keep fighting the good fight.
00:32:33.594 - 00:32:34.434, Speaker D: Thanks for joining us.
