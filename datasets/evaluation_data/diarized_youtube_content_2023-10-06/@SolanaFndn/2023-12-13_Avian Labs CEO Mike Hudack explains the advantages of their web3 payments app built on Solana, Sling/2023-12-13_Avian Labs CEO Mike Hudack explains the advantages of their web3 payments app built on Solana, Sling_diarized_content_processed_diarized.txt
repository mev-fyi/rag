00:00:00.320 - 00:00:28.604, Speaker A: I moved $10,000 from London to San Francisco instantly and for free. I mean, basically for free. It costs less than a penny, right? And when you think about this, in contrast to the way that most people do this today, it's not like twice as good. It's ten times better. It's 100 times better. So this is the leading international transfer company. I took a screenshot on Saturday of just moving $100.
00:00:28.604 - 00:00:58.584, Speaker A: You know, it's expensive and it's slow. I took this screenshot on Saturday and it's like, well, you're not going to get your money until Monday. And they're the best, by the way. Like everybody else is more expensive, slower. I mean, look at how much PayPal charges for this. And so when you think about it, when you have that experience of moving money like this on Solana with a stablecoin and it's instant and free, and then you look at this, you're like, well, why doesn't the whole world work this way?
