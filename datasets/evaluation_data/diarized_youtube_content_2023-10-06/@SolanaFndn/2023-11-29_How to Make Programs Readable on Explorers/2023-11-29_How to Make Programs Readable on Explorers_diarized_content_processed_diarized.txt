00:00:00.400 - 00:00:32.944, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. I just deployed myself an on chain game on Solana using the command NPX create Solana game. I called mine Lumberjack. And then I did a bunch of transactions. I chopped some trees and I looked at the transactions in the Solana Explorer, and yeah, I found the data quite cryptic, like there's no account names, and the instruction data is all in hexadecimal notation. And yeah, you can actually very easily change this by using the command anchor IdL init, followed by the path to your IDL and your program id. And this will upload your idl on chain, and then the explorers will be able to pass your data.
00:00:32.944 - 00:00:48.016, Speaker A: So now we can see here that the program is actually called Lumberjack, the transaction is called shoptree, and we can see also all the account names and the instruction data. So, yeah, try it out. Upload your idls for your programs and make your programs more readable on the Solana explorers. Bye.
