00:00:12.080 - 00:00:15.097, Speaker A: That's right. What's up?
00:00:15.241 - 00:00:29.205, Speaker B: Yep. Okay. I think probably just a quick intro and then we get started. I'm Arthur, the founder and CEO of Defiance Capital. We run a crypto hedge fund right now investing in crypto assets, liquid venture strategy. Yep.
00:00:29.985 - 00:00:43.561, Speaker A: I'm Joe, founder, CEO and CIO of Asymmetric. We're digital assets investment firm, but we actually operate more like a macro shop. And we have two hedge fund products and two venture funds as well.
00:00:43.673 - 00:01:05.497, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I think let's get started on the main topic. Right. Like, where's the alpha, liquid or venture? So for context, we have two funds. The first one, we did both liquid and venture. And the second fund, I've been focusing on liquid only and I got a lot of questions asked. Why don't you keep doing venture? You guys obviously have invested a lot of great companies in the past.
00:01:05.497 - 00:01:40.495, Speaker B: So what happened is we realized, let's talk about Solana specifically. We invested in around 12 Solana Venture bets and we realized that it massively underperformed so over the past three years. That's because we half of them didn't make it. And even for those who survived, it's hard for them to outperform Solana. So I think that's kind of like a big decision for us to really just focus on liquid. And combined with the fact that you can do risk management on liquid side, it just becomes really powerful. But I think, Joe, you guys run both the liquid and the venture side now.
00:01:40.495 - 00:01:42.403, Speaker B: Love to get your opinion on this.
00:01:42.579 - 00:02:39.565, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, so the key difference obviously is the duration of the fund. So most venture funds in general crypto is no different, have about a 10 year lockup. And the reason is you're buying like a long dated call option on the investments that you're making. And in theory, those that work out have exponential type returns. Whereas a hedge fund is typically like a one year lockup, sometimes it's a little shorter, maybe a little bit longer. So with that type of liquidity profile difference, if you're running a hedge fund, you will have opportunities to outperform a venture fund just given the constraint of the time associated with the lockup for your investors. On the flip side, because crypto venture is unique in the sense that these projects become liquid faster than traditional vc.
00:02:39.565 - 00:03:11.021, Speaker A: I mean, if you look at something like Stripe, for example, this is a company that's traded between 70 and $100 billion valuation on the private markets, still not public. It's been around for like what, 14, 13 years or something that would never happen in crypto because you end up with, you know, either a token generated token generation event within a year, two years, three years. The notion that you're going to be waiting say something like 10 years for some liquidity event in crypto just doesn't really happen unless you're buying pure equity in a business that doesn't have a token.
00:03:11.133 - 00:03:53.543, Speaker B: Yeah, I think another fact that has to do with the capital size you are allocating to crypto as well. And it's my firm opinion that if you are actually allocating less than 100 million to crypto, you always get a, almost always get a better risk adjusted return in liquid. But obviously if you have more than 100 million to deploy, you want to get the longer term kind of like a growth of the asset, it start to make sense in the venture. But I think that for most of us in the stage, that is a very good problem for us to have. And so I think in most cases I just think that liquid outperform. And when you look at most of the venture fund returns, they actually struggle to outperform even Bitcoin. It doesn't matter which vintage you look at 2018, 2021, 2022.
00:03:53.543 - 00:04:14.845, Speaker B: So I think for most of us, liquid is still where the alpha is. And historically when you see all the exponential growth of crypto public asset like Ethereum, Solana, all this thing like you can get in Solana, but what's the lowest price you can get in Solana? It's like 18 cents or $1 each. And right now Solana is like 140, $50.
00:04:15.625 - 00:05:01.979, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean look, the interesting thing about liquid fund investing and the size you're describing is if you're running less than 100 million bucks and you're just kind of like a long biased or long only fund, you can just basically buy spot tokens in a bull market and do extremely well. The problem of course is the bear market. And I think that this is where we at asymmetric are somewhat differentiated. Myself, my trading partner, have about 50 years combined trading and risk management experience. But we also trade a lot of options and derivatives. And so that enables us to, you know, take a bearish view through fixed risk, through things like put spreads versus just being naked short. Because if you're naked short in crypto, I mean that's how you get your head blown off.
00:05:01.979 - 00:05:56.715, Speaker A: And there's been many people that have blown up just being short and caught on the wrong side for no apparent reason. You can actually do a really good job of building a sizable Portfolio through options. Especially when you calculate what's called the options adjusted delta in that portfolio with a fixed amount of risk. And so the beauty of this is that you know at Asymmetric we started eight figures of aum, we're now at nine figures of AUM through capital appreciation. And that has mostly to do with trading options and derivatives, the options and derivatives markets. Even last year in 2023 when spot volumes were basically anemic, falling off, you know, the cliff options, open interest and volume would kept hitting new all time highs. And so part of the reason we're very comfortable trading much larger sizes is because as the market is increasing in terms of open interest and volume, that favors our strategy.
00:05:56.715 - 00:06:06.763, Speaker A: So we could run say our fund up to easily like $1 billion of a on liquid fund which if you're just a long only spot, you know, trading fund, it's next to impossible.
00:06:06.939 - 00:06:50.465, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think another fact that is you do not really get a market like crypto where as Joe mentioned a project have a token at a very early stage of their life cycle. Like usually most project that launch a token are like series A or latest series B in terms of the lifecycle. So you're actually still getting a bulk of the venture skill return even when you invest in a token that has launched. And I think this is something that you don't really see in the public traditional equity market. So to me that you're actually also getting a venture skill return but with the capability of managing the risk. I think this is very important. Like I think in crypto a lot of times we mistook incentive driven growth as a real product market fit.
00:06:50.465 - 00:07:08.605, Speaker B: But it turned out that certain sector is like we are like five years too early or like 10 years too early. And if you do venture you can't really manage this risk. But in liquid you're able to rebalance according to the different macro condition, the different ecosystem. And I think when it comes to ecosystem it even more important like.
00:07:10.385 - 00:07:10.673, Speaker A: We.
00:07:10.689 - 00:07:37.189, Speaker B: Have such a huge extreme power law like southern ecosystem are going to do so well related to others. And if you don't really have sufficient exposure to like Solana ecosystem one year ago, you're like all, you know like layer one ecosystem B and what are you going to do? Your fund is fully deployed and Solana turned out to be the best performing ecosystem and you have no exposure. So I think this something is something very valuable. Yeah, and I think we'd like to switch the topic to a little bit like on the meme coins.
00:07:37.237 - 00:07:37.445, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:37.485 - 00:08:06.159, Speaker B: Your favorite I Think one of the key thing is like, how does Meme Coin fit into the portfolio? Both from like, obviously it's liquid in nature, but can you actually build like, do you think like venture way of thinking about Meme Coin is actually possible? Like, can you build like a three year, five year position in Meme Coins or like it's just pure trading? Like, you know, whoever you know, the big kols are talking about, you know, like, I don't know, I'm not a meme Coin expert, but yeah, yeah.
00:08:06.207 - 00:08:52.349, Speaker A: So at Asymmetric, we kind of sit at the intersection of technology, capital and culture and this is what's enabled us to, you know, we were probably, I think, the first kind of institutional fund that actually invested in Meme Coins back in October of last year. We identified bonk at a $28 million market cap as an unbelievable asymmetric opportunity. And that worked out and there was a lot of reasons why we made that investment. But at a kind of core level, my job as a hedge fund manager is to make my investors money and they actually don't give a shit what I'm trading. They just want to see the returns. And so I think what you end up seeing in a lot of cases, and you can actually see a lot of VCs bloviating online about why Meme coins are terrible. Look at their bags.
00:08:52.349 - 00:09:25.795, Speaker A: If they've invested billions of dollars in a dozen different L2s on Ethereum and Meme coins are outperforming them, oops. Right. You better have a good reason why that's the case. I don't think that there's a case to be made around like should have, should a VC fund invest in Meme Coins? Because that's, it's somewhat counterintuitive, right? Like everybody in this audience right now, if you pulled out your phones and you connect your wallet to pump fun, you can create a Meme Coin. Simple. It's trivial. It just doesn't exist in the context of venture related investing.
00:09:25.795 - 00:10:29.719, Speaker A: So I would argue on the liquid side, and I've argued this for quite some time, having exposure to what we would call meme coins, culture coins, celeb coins, whatever you want to call them, the non traditional sort of utility based tokens or governance tokens for protocols and applications. You're foolish if you don't have some exposure to that in your portfolio because the asymmetry and the upside of these positions is enormous. And I think that if more and more people understand that if you want to actually outperform something like buy and hold Bitcoin buy and hold Ethereum, which pretty easy this year total three. That's what we use internally as our benchmark. You have to have exposure to something like Meme Coins because if you look at the last cycle, Dogecoin was crazy outperforming so many of these like you know, thesis driven VC investments. And by the way, I'm a vc but like let's be clear, like look at the returns of something like Dogecoin last cycle. You mean to tell me you're not going to have something, some exposure at least a point of view on expressing that in your liquid portfolio? It'd be crazy not to do that.
00:10:29.719 - 00:11:03.297, Speaker A: So I don't think venture investors make. It makes a lot of sense for meme coins because you know, 99.9% of meme coins are just you know like flash in the pan topical at that moment there are going to be meme coins, there are meme coins that are blue chips. Right. And there will be meme coins that will become blue chips. But as a venture investor, most venture investors don't have a pulse on culture and that's ultimately what meme coins represent. So it makes sense in my opinion to have that in your liquid portfolio versus something like a venture fund.
00:11:03.481 - 00:11:46.983, Speaker B: Yeah, I think actually speaking something adjacent to this is very relevant to Solana. So we have been bullish on Solana ecosystem for a long time and we are more of a fundamental driven investor. So we look at all the data, the on chain transaction, TVL volumes, whatever metrics we can find to form a fundamental view about the protocol that are building on top of Solana, all the solana DeFi project DEP and whatever. And one of the counter arguments I receive from more the more like trading active trading crowd is like if you're bullish on Solana you do the barbell portfolio. You long sold and you long to sold meme coins. You don't touch anything in between. And that's kind of sometimes a bit demoralizing for all the, you know, builders that are building the real stuff on Solana.
00:11:46.983 - 00:12:11.817, Speaker B: Like you build the deepin, you build a defi. But you power all this speculation and all this usage on Solana but nobody's buying a token. People just Meme coins also don't touch anything in between. And empirically Meme coin has definitely outperformed all these so called Solana outs a lot. I can't think that will change. But I don't have a very clear answer. What will be the trigger? I mean I always think that, you know, we invest over like a few years.
00:12:11.817 - 00:12:15.945, Speaker B: Fundamentals do matters and eventually matters. But what do you, what's your take on this?
00:12:15.985 - 00:13:19.019, Speaker A: Like, yeah, I mean look like, sorry, if people like to speculate. Like people have been gambling forever and in fact there has never been an industry or market exists without speculation as the necessary and sufficient condition to start that. If you can look in the United States for example, the late 1800s, people were speculating on this thing called a railroad. This has been going on forever and it's not going to stop. And in fact speculation actually leads to new use cases. Did you know in 2023 that 75% of all of the revenue for Las Vegas Strip casinos came from non gambling revenue? That means a casino that is literally designed to make money off of speculation is no longer making money off of speculation. So the notion that people speculating on meme coins is somehow, you know, deleterious to the industry or it's shitting on the founders that are putting in work, chewing glass, building amazing stuff, that's just nonsense because people are going to do this no matter what.
00:13:19.019 - 00:13:56.933, Speaker A: There's no difference between say buying a meme coin and hoping that it goes up a versus buying a lottery ticket. And that's why 99.9% of all the meme coin traders on Pump Fun have not made money because it's a lottery ticket. It's, it's speculation for the hope of becoming like a headline on one of these crypto media outlets that's like 17 year old kid put a hundred bucks in whiff and made $10 million or whatever. Right? Like people love to see those headlines, especially media companies. It's the same concept with lottery ticket. So I think, you know, last night myself and Iggy Azalea announced that we were putting on a Motherland casino.
00:13:56.933 - 00:14:12.517, Speaker A: Right? There's going to be way more use cases beyond just a casino that we're going to be putting into that product. Because we see speculation as like the beginning for other use cases that can come from things like meme coins, celeb coins and culture coins.
00:14:12.661 - 00:15:06.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the one last topic we should talk touch upon is very relevant is the US election. It's like less than two months away. And in my opinion as non Americans, I think this is the first time the politics and crypto in us are just so closely intertwined. And I actually think the long term structural impact of the Republican presidency versus Democratic presidency is very big because you're going to get a very friendly SEC regulatory and political policy. But short term, you know, what do you think is an impact? I think we are going to see like a 20% difference in market cap of crypto within like few days after you get a result like Trump market probably go up by 10% and if we get Kamala market down by 10%, that seems to be close to where the option market pricing is as well. The volatility is 12%. But yeah, how do you think we should manage to risk like.
00:15:06.235 - 00:15:50.469, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I don't think it actually really matters. It's a coin flip right now for who's going to win the presidency of the United States. I think the bigger issue is that what happens if one other side doesn't actually acknowledge that the other person won? That could trigger a constitutional crisis in the United States which would enter like a lot of risk and volatility into the markets. The good news is, guess what benefits from that? Bitcoin. Typically when you have chaotic markets like we saw in March of 2023 when there was a regional bank crisis and United States bitcoin went from 19,500 to 31,000 in six weeks. So do I want a constitutional crisis in the United States? Absolutely not. If it happens, it actually is still net positive to crypto, at least from my perspective.
00:15:50.469 - 00:16:06.535, Speaker A: I think if Trump wins, bitcoin goes to 100k pretty quickly. I think it's pretty self evident and consensus view at this point. If Kamala Harris wins, you know, bitcoin maybe trades up close to all time highs. It just takes probably longer for bitcoin to get to 100k.
00:16:07.355 - 00:16:10.755, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah, I think that's it. Yeah.
00:16:10.795 - 00:16:12.339, Speaker A: Yeah. This is fun. Thanks.
00:16:12.427 - 00:16:12.675, Speaker B: Yep.
