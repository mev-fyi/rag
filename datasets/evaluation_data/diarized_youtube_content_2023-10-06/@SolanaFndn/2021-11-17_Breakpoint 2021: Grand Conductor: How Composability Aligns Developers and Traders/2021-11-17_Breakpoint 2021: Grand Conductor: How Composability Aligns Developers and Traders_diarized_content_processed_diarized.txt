00:00:09.360 - 00:00:09.584, Speaker A: Hello.
00:00:09.584 - 00:00:50.570, Speaker B: Hello, everyone. GM, thanks for joining us. You know, day three in the morning of a conference is not the easiest journey to make, let's say. Anyway, we're going to talk about composability. We have Amal from quick node, and we're going to talk about how composability is really the secret ingredient in blockchains that lets us unlock a huge amount of value and creativity. So, amel, I don't know if you want to start by telling us a little bit about quick node. You guys just had a massive, well, a pretty hefty funding round led by Tiger Global.
00:00:50.722 - 00:01:10.954, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. So what quicknode does. So we are leaders in blockchain infrastructure. So imagine cloud computing means blockchain. Essentially what we do is we. Our mission is to make blockchain development really easy across multiple different types of chains.
00:01:10.954 - 00:01:47.890, Speaker A: Recently, we announced a funding round with Tiger. They're one of our backers, along with Alexis Ohanian, 776 funds. He was on stage earlier. And we are multi chain from the start. So we really do believe that the future is going to be focused on composability, and it's ultimately going to be something where it's not just one chain that wins, it's going to be multiple chains. Each chain has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and we think that that's going to enrich the overall ecosystem.
00:01:48.082 - 00:02:00.894, Speaker B: Well, I just wanted to sort of set the stage and zoom out a little bit before we dive into Solana specific stuff. But what does composability across chains sort of mean for a multi chain world?
00:02:01.514 - 00:02:44.064, Speaker A: Yeah. So the easiest way of thinking about this is if you look at the evolution of the Defi marketplace, right? So total value locked across all of DeFi is something like $300 billion. If you look back a year ago, almost 100% of it was focused on Ethereum. Today, Ethereum has about a 75% market share. So it's like a little over 200 billion in TVL. And now you have other chains where there's a lot of DeFi activity that's taking place. So finance smart chain is number two, Solana is number three, with about 15 billion total value locked.
00:02:44.064 - 00:03:22.374, Speaker A: How all of. But there's advantages, right, when it comes to some of these changes, like Solana, right, which is really focused on low transaction costs and speed. And so the way that you can go from 15 billion to 300 billion is ultimately by making something that's interlockable, right. It's like legos for finance. And so composability, which means that you can basically take an asset from one ecosystem, move it to another chain. That's really fundamental in terms of this multi chain future that we're going to see.
00:03:22.914 - 00:03:39.334, Speaker B: And so you guys have a great view across, I think you support like ten different chains. Right. So you have a great view across this multi chain landscape for Solana specifically, what does that look like for you all? Like how much, for example, of your business is Solana specific?
00:03:40.354 - 00:04:08.604, Speaker A: So Solana is one of our fastest growing chains, and we just launched in August. We've seen almost a twelve x increase in terms of total number of developers. In fact, today. Quick note, I think we support almost 25% of all development across the Solana ecosystem. So we're pretty significant. We work with the leading exchanges, wallet providers, all of that. And we're seeing just a ton of interest and activity in Solana.
00:04:08.604 - 00:04:13.974, Speaker A: Right. And a lot of movement here across the board. So it's really an exciting time.
00:04:14.134 - 00:04:24.142, Speaker B: Well, I mean, speaking of the inbound interest, what sorts of customers or what sorts of businesses are you seeing coming through to you?
00:04:24.318 - 00:04:58.642, Speaker A: We work with the leading wallet providers exchanges, both centralized and decentralized analytic providers. So our customer base really varies. Right. We work with multi billion hedge funds to bedroom developers. And at the end of the day, what everybody's most interested in is essentially a service that has low latency, that has access to multiple types of chains so that you can boot one chain and then you have access to multiple others. And that's been what we've been really focused on, that's been driving the growth.
00:04:58.778 - 00:05:19.844, Speaker B: Gotcha. Gotcha. I mean, I guess we can't really talk about enterprise or business interest in crypto these days without talking about nfts. Are you seeing, you know, interest from, let's say, you know, brands or companies that, you know, are not from finance, for example, that are interested in getting involved?
00:05:20.004 - 00:05:55.844, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's just been an explosion in terms of the number of Defi projects, sorry, of NFT projects on Solana. In fact, just last week. So there was the NFT con in New York, right? And there was just this, so much palpable energy from all of these different projects. And we work with a number of them, a lot of the sort of leading NFT developers projects exchanges. And so that's been, there's just been a tremendous amount of interest. And Solana has a lot of interesting elements about it. Right.
00:05:55.844 - 00:06:04.278, Speaker A: The low transaction costs, ability to mint relatively cheaply. I think they're attracting a lot of different projects. So we see that continuing.
00:06:04.446 - 00:06:23.674, Speaker B: Gotcha. I mean, just to go back to the multi chain world theme again, you know, let's say a brand comes to you. They say, we want to mint our first NFT collection. Where should we do it? What chain should we use? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Like, how do you, I guess, kind of guide them through that process?
00:06:25.414 - 00:07:12.434, Speaker A: It's a good question. I think that it depends in terms of what a specific project's really looking to accomplish. So at the end of the day, our job is to provide basically a fast, high quality infrastructure. Some projects are really interested in Ethereum because that's where there's historically been a lot of NFT projects created. Others are focused on Matic because of the low transaction costs and the fact that you can still tie to Ethereum. Solana is seeing a lot of interest lately, right? And so it depends in terms of where you are in the ecosystem, whether there's a lot of historical development, whether you're interested in governance, whether you're interested in speed. The trilemma still applies.
00:07:12.434 - 00:07:53.414, Speaker A: And so it varies. It's the short way of answering it. But what we are seeing, right, is that there's just been a lot of interest in essentially minting projects, a lot of different types of projects. And what you're starting to see is different business models that are emerging too, right? It's not just jpegs. It's also around music. And the guys from Audius, they were up here earlier, they're building on Solana. I think that you can start to see a whole wave of consumer applications that are forming where it's not just jpegs, but you're going to start to see music, you're going to start to see social networks.
00:07:53.414 - 00:08:22.174, Speaker A: So yesterday, Alexis Ohanian, he announced with the Solano foundation that they are investing 100 million in the next wave of social development. He's one of our backers. We believe that that's the future. And at this conference, there's a number of interesting projects. I think they want to be the TikTok of India and built on web3. And I think that's just an example of just many of the opportunity that's here.
00:08:22.634 - 00:09:04.954, Speaker B: Well, you know, we were talking earlier and, you know, you worked at some of the biggest web two, let's say, platforms, right, including TikTok. And I'm just wondering, when you look at application developers coming to you today, you know, they look out, it's a multi chain ecosystem. Developers now can pick and choose, right, which chains they want to start off on or which ones they want to be on. Versus it feels like a few years ago it was much more like, well, you pick the chain. The chain dictates what you can do as an application developer. Do you see that happening? Is there a bit of a shift more towards in favor of application developers now?
00:09:05.444 - 00:09:41.880, Speaker A: I think that's the promise of web3. You're right. I did come from the world of, I worked at Facebook, I worked at TikTok. And Chris Dixon put something where it was just talking about how at the beginning of a platform's evolution, right, it's very friendly towards creators. And over time that dynamic changes. And so as a result, right, you end up having more power accruing to the platform, and a lot of the creators really don't have a say. So the concept of portability, right, which is tied to composability, is something which is premised on web3.
00:09:41.880 - 00:10:08.250, Speaker A: That's the power of what a lot of the people in this audience are creating. And you are seeing that, right. The platform no longer dictates that. And so being able to take your ip and to take your data and then to monetize it across different platforms, across different chains is, I think, the fundamental premise behind the potential here of Web three. So I think it could be a game changer.
00:10:08.362 - 00:10:23.690, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And we're still getting a lot of those building blocks in place, like identity, for example, is a key kind of composability piece that will really turbocharge, I think a lot of these use cases, especially social use cases, I guess.
00:10:23.802 - 00:10:24.538, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:10:24.626 - 00:10:42.696, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I'm just wondering about, you know, what you think of the current kind of Solana landscape in terms of any bridges or adapters that help Solana smart contracts or applications get used across other chains.
00:10:42.800 - 00:11:21.428, Speaker A: For instance, I think that earlier this week, sir, I met with some of the people from neon labs. They did. Or neon. And they are, I think, really kind of at the bleeding edge in terms of making it easy for people to take something from Ethereum and then port it over to Solana and vice versa. Right. And it takes advantage of technologies like wormhole that are really kind of at the heart of what, of essentially making it easy to move from one platform to another. So I'm really kind of excited just about the emergence of that.
00:11:21.428 - 00:11:37.580, Speaker A: And I think ultimately it will get to, it will help the foundation reach its goal of getting to, I think, a million developers, which today we're at about 2000. So there's a lot of room to grow. Right. To catch up to Ethereum and some of these other more established chains.
00:11:37.652 - 00:11:59.500, Speaker B: Yeah, plenty of Runway and maybe lastly, we only have a couple of minutes left. What do you think are the pieces of the composer of the sort of money Lego or maybe social Lego kit? What are the pieces that are still missing? What do you think needs to be built? What do you think will really unlock.
00:11:59.532 - 00:12:55.784, Speaker A: Some really interesting use cases from a developer standpoint? You have a lot of Solana, or, sorry, a lot of ethereum that's built on solidity, right? And Solana runs on rust. Neon Labs is trying to solve that, because now you can take something that's written in solidity and apply it to Solana. That opens up the realm for a lot of developers to enter into the ecosystem. So things like that, that interoperability are going to be really important. The second thing is just around people being able to take that value from one ecosystem to another in a way that is with less friction. Right. And so that's something which you started to see that some of the L2 solutions, if you have to wait a week to move back to a layer one, not ideal.
00:12:55.784 - 00:13:39.176, Speaker A: Instead, if you can move your assets more freely and with lower transaction costs, that opens up the entire market, that's something which is going to be really important. And so I think that's another key piece. And then just with a lot of the innovation that's happening in Defi is an example, right, where if you make it so that you have true interoperability between these different chains, that's going to improve transaction costs, that's going to improve liquidity. And so those are all important things as you're thinking about ultimately improving the user experience. Right. And that's important in terms of being able to move value and to have depth of markets. And those are going to be really kind of key criterion.
00:13:39.176 - 00:13:41.400, Speaker A: And we're seeing that happen.
00:13:41.592 - 00:14:31.664, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I mean, I was talking earlier about identity, like we just saw, for example, the Ethereum name service, excuse me, which is a key, I guess, plank of the Ethereum ecosystem in terms of identity. They just did a successful token airdrop and so on. And it feels like those are the things that will turbocharge this whole identity piece. And once you have that in place, you can do really cool things with it, especially on the social side. You look at Twitter, for example, they're developing a PFP authentication feature with good identity, you'll be able to do that in a web3 native way, and you can take it with you maybe across chains, for example. So it seems like, yeah, that would be a really cool social lego to have to play with.
00:14:31.784 - 00:14:52.164, Speaker A: I think you're going to see a lot more of the web two players trying to build web3 capabilities. We're having conversations with a number of those kinds of, along those those lines, and you'll also see a lot more development happening on web3 natively as some of these tools tools come online. So 100% I'm with you.
00:14:52.284 - 00:14:57.884, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, amal, it's been a pleasure, and thanks to you all for listening.
00:14:58.004 - 00:14:58.644, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
