00:00:03.760 - 00:00:12.086, Speaker A: Welcome everyone to this week's Changelog, where we go over the changes week by week on Solana. My name is Jacob, and today I'm joined by someone new. Bree, how about you introduce yourself a little bit?
00:00:12.230 - 00:00:15.754, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Bri. I'm a new developer advocate, Solana foundation.
00:00:16.174 - 00:00:40.064, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. And let's get started. So just yesterday, the day before this video goes live, the Renaissance hackathon should have ended. If you are interested in looking at the projects, you should be able to go view the projects under. You'll have to log in to view the projects, but you should be able to view the projects. And I wish everybody best of luck. Those that have submitted to the hackathon.
00:00:40.064 - 00:01:08.972, Speaker A: Next up on the list, we're going to go through SIMD 133. This is the syscall for get epic stake. What this means is it's a way to get the vote counts delegated stake during a current epoch. So if you need to look up that stake, you can do that via the Sy's call. It's currently under discussion. It might be approved by the time this video goes live because there's multiple approvals, but yeah. So if you're interested, go read up on SIMD 133.
00:01:08.972 - 00:01:11.584, Speaker A: And then, Bree, what did you see this week?
00:01:12.164 - 00:01:37.044, Speaker B: Yeah, so I was looking into the scan index improvement. So what was happening was the total account state is exceeding the available ram on validators. So now there's a new storage format being introduced. And what this format is, it's adding a scan index to the storage API to allow efficient returning of what is necessary to the index storage. And this will result in an improved performance.
00:01:38.184 - 00:01:46.600, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, it's always good to see performance improvements like this. This is actually done by Jeff too, which is the head of Anza, which is funny to see.
00:01:46.752 - 00:01:47.484, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:01:48.464 - 00:02:27.254, Speaker A: Another commit that happened is actually a change to web3 js. I didn't realize this, but apparently pre flight commitment has always been burned broken. So if you try to use the value of pre flight commitment to determine how to behave when sending a transaction or to specifically bypass the pre flight, it wouldn't work. So this is an interesting bug that I'm very surprised has lasted as long as it has, but it's now been fixed. So if you want to get this new bug fix, you can upgrade to 191.4 and get it fixed on your web.
00:02:29.074 - 00:02:44.706, Speaker B: So our resource of the week is flare. Flare is a command line interface for developers on Solana and what it is is a way to interact with your smart contracts directly through the CLI. You just have to supply your IDL and you can pass through the arguments that you want to use to interact with your smart contracts.
00:02:44.890 - 00:02:50.722, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. This will make working with smart contracts, like testing them as you build them, a lot easier, right?
00:02:50.858 - 00:02:52.214, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:02:52.634 - 00:03:20.146, Speaker A: Cool. And then for the stack exchange, user reputation leagues. So we go through this and we give a shout out to all the people that made it to the top every week. So we have John John, we have Ari, Jonas, white, Seal, and Nabeel. So thanks to all these people for contributing back to the stack exchange. If you're interested in helping out the new developer cohort every week, please contribute to the stack change. Right now, we get like 500 new developers every week joining.
00:03:20.146 - 00:03:33.336, Speaker A: So they all have questions and they all need help. So help them out. Help everybody on in the future. If you just answer a question once there, that's all we got for this week. Thank you for joining me this week, Bree, and we'll see you next week.
00:03:33.520 - 00:03:33.984, Speaker B: Thank you.
