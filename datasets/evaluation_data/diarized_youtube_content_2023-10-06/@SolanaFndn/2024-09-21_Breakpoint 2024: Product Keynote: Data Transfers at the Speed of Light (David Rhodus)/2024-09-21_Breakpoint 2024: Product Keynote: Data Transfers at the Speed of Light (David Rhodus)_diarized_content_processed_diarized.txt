00:00:05.680 - 00:00:36.039, Speaker A: Hello, I'm David Rodes, founder and CEO of Permissionless Labs. We're the maker of Pipe Network. I'm going to move really quickly through this talk because of the limited time. So my team consists of top engineers from companies like aws, Valve, crunchyroll, Palantir. So we've got decades of experience building high performance software. So we're dedicated to making Pipe Network the next evolution in content delivery. Pipe Network is made for any application.
00:00:36.039 - 00:01:12.205, Speaker A: So Pipe CDN users access data faster than any other way. So whether it's video images, large language models. My bold North Star is to deliver data in 3 milliseconds plus the speed of light. Anyone could run a pipe node and contribute bandwidth. So traditional CDNs, they operate in data centers, so they're typically about 150 miles from the end users. This causes significant latency. So Pipeway Pipe uses hyper local nodes.
00:01:12.205 - 00:01:47.631, Speaker A: These are within like 10 miles of the user. This significantly reduces latency by shortening the distance of light between the data and the end user. So we're going to switch over and do a quick recorded demo. So using a recording the void punishment from the demo gods. So we're going to log into the client portal. This is as a customer, right. So we've got three origins configured to play egress out of.
00:01:47.631 - 00:02:15.055, Speaker A: We're just gonna add a new quic origin. So we support S3 storage today. To give this like a quick name, we're gonna save it. It'll give us an endpoint that the customer will embed in their application. So here we're gonna switch over for a quick video test playback. So we're gonna play some video. This is being distributed across all the Pipe Pop nodes so loads very quickly targeting the closest pipe nodes to.
00:02:15.055 - 00:02:42.835, Speaker A: So here we're going to quickly add a new Pipe POP node. Let's run a quick install script. Restart the Linux service. This will join it to the Pipe Network. Here we're just going to quickly look in the logs, grab the node ID and we can see now it's attached to the network. So we'll switch back to the slides and. Yeah, so currently Pipe Network is in private beta.
00:02:42.835 - 00:02:58.175, Speaker A: Stay in touch for upcoming announcement about our testnet. You can join now by running a Pipe POP node or using Pipe CDN to deliver data faster than ever to your users. Scan the QR codes to join us today and thank you so much.
