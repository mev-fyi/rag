00:00:04.120 - 00:00:42.720, Speaker A: Is there even a pot of money at the end of the rainbow? Some days it feels like that pot gets ever more elusive. Sometimes there's a lot to discuss. We're in a weird period where it's not quite bull, not quite bare. We're thawing out of a winter, as it were. We've got some great panelists to unpack the current state of crypto VC, so maybe we'll just do a quick round of introductions. I'm Frank Shaparo, the editor at large at the block, and we can just go through the list. Remember, there's a difference between introducing yourself and pontificating ad nauseum, so give the audience a quick intro.
00:00:42.720 - 00:00:43.924, Speaker A: Katrina.
00:00:44.264 - 00:00:54.044, Speaker B: Hey guys, I'm Katrina. I am an investment partner at Portal Ventures. We are a business model centric protocol investment firm based out of New York.
00:00:55.874 - 00:01:16.574, Speaker C: Hey, this is Praneet, one of the investment partners at Ethereal Ventures. We're a web3 firm that was set up by what constituted the former venture investment team at consensus. And we just like to back domain experts in really technical teams building in web3.
00:01:18.234 - 00:01:28.454, Speaker D: Hello everyone, my name is Tashar, I'm co founder and managing partner at a firm called Multicoin Capital. We're active investors in the crypto space across public and private markets.
00:01:29.794 - 00:01:50.214, Speaker E: Hello everybody, my name is Alexander Tkachenka, I am founder and CEO of VNX and in my previous life I was a managing partner of two Blu, one of the few active VC's six or seven years ago that started to invest into crypto or blockchain companies in Europe.
00:01:51.204 - 00:01:58.624, Speaker A: Fantastic. So let's start with an overview. What is the state of crypto venture capital right now as you see it in your seat?
00:01:59.444 - 00:03:02.368, Speaker B: I think there are some very exciting development over the past one or two weeks, as we saw it might have been the ETF ticker coming on DTCC, but it turns out it's been listing there since August. But still, I think market from technical analysis that we've BTC has reclaimed its 200 day average and that's usually a sign that we officially or according to technical analysis, came out of the bear market. Whether it will self correct and go back down a little bit, we don't know, but it has been a while. We're in this low state and there are upcoming catalysts and the reason why I'm saying BTC is it's usually the leader of the entire market and the liquidity will flow once the BTC essentially reclaim its popularity. And the next year we have bitcoin happening. Have more ETF news coming online. So from me personal view, I am very optimistic.
00:03:02.368 - 00:03:04.524, Speaker B: Cautiously was very optimistic.
00:03:05.104 - 00:03:32.014, Speaker A: Tuchar, to what extent do those moves, the momentum on the liquid side of the market, translate into venture? Is there a lag? Obviously, people see a lot of excitement right now with ETF, to Katrina's point, but is that necessarily translating into an increase in deal flow or more venture activity? Because that's, I mean, been stuck in the doldrums for over a year.
00:03:33.594 - 00:04:09.472, Speaker D: It is translating into more. But how much more is, is really the question. Because when you're a venture investor, you need to see exits. So then you have capital to recycle back into newer projects. You need to distribute out to LP's, raise your next fund, and now you have more money to go invest in earlier projects, in this case, in this specific bear market. I don't actually think there was ever a shortage of capital for venture deals. I think there was a shortage of deals, actually.
00:04:09.472 - 00:04:39.000, Speaker D: I think there was a shortage of entrepreneurs. So yes, the public markets thawing here and this recent rally is welcome and it doesn't hurt. But I don't think the main benefit from it is coming from the capital market side of more capital available. I think the main benefit is coming from entrepreneurs feeling safer to go quit their jobs and found a company, or entrepreneurs feeling like it's a better time to go raise their next round if they've already started a company.
00:04:39.152 - 00:05:14.094, Speaker A: It's a really good point. It sort of paints a picture of a dichotomy that I think exists between the early stage, this new wave of entrepreneurs that are maybe more comfortable to enter the market. To your point, while it's at the same time, right, you still have 50, 80 some odd unicorns that raised in the previous cycle that what are they doing now? Where's their pot at the end of the rainbow? It doesn't seem like it's there. You think about the 80 some odd unicorns that, you know, we're hearing whisperings of down rounds, even despite the rosier picture that Katrina painted. What's your opinion on that, Alex?
00:05:15.114 - 00:06:15.824, Speaker E: I actually would share this opinion. I think in the last bull run, when the money was cheap, a lot of companies raised money on, let's put it, very optimistic expectations of the growth. And now LP's specifically see that the growth is not necessarily there. At the same time, you can have quite good yields on the bond market and it's somehow, I think, geopolitical situation changes in the macroeconomy, or just overall feeling of uncertainty does not necessarily permits to fund large deals in the b round. Plus I would say, I think seed stage, post seed stage are probably okay, but large checks in my view, is a little bit of a problem.
00:06:15.984 - 00:06:46.444, Speaker A: Yeah, the risk free rate being above 5% is bad for anyone who raised above billion, even maybe 500 last cycle. But there's ample opportunities in this earlier stage that sounds like that's the foundation on which we can dive deeper into this conversation. How have you maybe thought differently, Praneeth, about how you're investing in early stage web3 projects relative to maybe years past?
00:06:48.224 - 00:08:13.346, Speaker C: I think it's always helpful to have a historical point of reference to see how companies in the web3 space have performed, what kind of business models have worked in the past, what other failures that the teams have experienced while they were building in the space. And that in and of itself is a relatively useful way for us to kind of have some data points in terms of understanding how sustainable businesses are. It's also interesting where we're seeing signs in the public markets as it relates to there being more of a correlation between token prices and metrics that matter for protocols and markets actually taking that into account, barring a few idiosyncratic price changes. And so in one way, shape and sense, I think it's this notion of maturity that is coming to crypto as an asset class. That's what's helpful to kind of see. And so we've always been very focused on founders have been obsessed about building product people who've been thinking of they're their domains from a very long time, but it's also very helpful for us to understand what their true intents are as it relates to building a commercially successful and viable business cost, again, in the light of decentralization that we're seeing. So that's been important for us to understand and engage.
00:08:13.490 - 00:08:35.034, Speaker A: It's interesting because you're talking less about maybe the parameters that shape your thesis and more so the way in which you maybe analyze a certain deal that comes through. Are we maturing? Are there new metrics or data points through which you can suss out a deal?
00:08:35.774 - 00:09:04.756, Speaker B: We primarily focus on pre seed, so really there's very little data point to work off of. That's why our approach is very much thesis driven and know what you're looking for versus what's not the challenge or the beauty. Two sides of the same coin is crypto. Every day there are new things happening, and if you don't pay attention for even a day, you're kind of out of the loop. So there could be a lot of noise. That's why kind of the emphasis on having a thesis know. Exactly.
00:09:04.756 - 00:09:46.544, Speaker B: Here's the future vision of where we see the space would go and here's the gap, and we want to fill that gap. Hence, hey, like these deals, we want to look immediately. I'll even go to say most of the deal we've done actually come from outbound research driven, because the benefits are twofold. When you do the market, do the research of a sector, you meet people expert who are either building something or they will build something. So you get it early, especially important for early stage fund like myself. And the second one is once you publish out your thought leadership, you attract very high quality inbound because then you think along the same line. So that's very much the driving force of our investment.
00:09:47.434 - 00:09:55.410, Speaker A: Interesting. If you're really looking to sift the noise out of the equation, there's a great tool called the block data dashboard.
00:09:55.522 - 00:09:56.234, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:09:56.394 - 00:10:22.464, Speaker A: And you also have the block deals dashboard as well. Definitely something to check out. Thank you for the plug. So how does that sort of jive with the way you're approaching things at Multicoin? Is it because you guys used to be quite prolific in terms of putting out research and kind of outlying your thesis? Has that approach changed in this current market?
00:10:23.324 - 00:10:48.426, Speaker D: No, not really. I mean, we still put out content. Now look, we're not content producers. We don't have to publish. So we only publish when we have something interesting to say. And sometimes we have less interesting things to say and sometimes we have more interesting things to say. But no, what Katrina said resonates very much with us in terms of looking at the thesis being qualitative investors rather than quantitative investors.
00:10:48.426 - 00:11:26.134, Speaker D: I think this industry is not mature enough for quantitative investment. And in fact, it leads to a sense of false precision where people use what I think are absolutely garbage metrics like TVL or active addresses. I mean, I hate these metrics because you're just lying to yourself about something and trying to convince yourself that this is a good investment thesis because of these numbers. And I think the best investments in crypto will be made on qualitative feedback rather than, oh, well, this chain has more active addresses than this chain, I think means nothing.
00:11:26.994 - 00:11:51.764, Speaker A: It's an interesting point that raises a question. So to your point, right, you can have these various metrics and they might create these blind spots for other ways to examine a project. How do you invest in multiple, if you sort of are really deep into one ecosystem, how do you ensure that that also doesn't create a blind spot for opportunities across other chains.
00:11:53.024 - 00:12:44.504, Speaker D: I mean, you have to go to the events. You have to continuously be asking yourself, if I was wrong, what would it look like? Obviously, we're very heavily invested in the Solana ecosystem at Multicoin. We invested in Solana before they launched. We've invested in a bunch of Solana teams, but we do our best to not be blindsided and wonder, well, if another ecosystem was going to win, what would that look like? And what should we be looking for? And what we're specifically looking for is entrepreneurs building net new, unique products in different ecosystems. Your ecosystem has a liquid staking token and a borrow lend marketplace and an NFT exchange. I don't care. That's table stakes.
00:12:44.504 - 00:12:56.664, Speaker D: That's just not enough. Your ecosystem has something that's truly unique, that an entrepreneur chose to build there deliberately, and not just because you threw money at them. Now you have my attention.
00:12:58.244 - 00:13:25.224, Speaker A: It's an interesting point, Alex. How do you sort of think about the new wave of entrepreneurs that have maybe entered into this space, this cycle? Is there anything different? I hear a lot more about consumer than maybe previous cycles where defi was king. What sort of maybe defines the profile of this new wave of entrepreneurs?
00:13:28.124 - 00:14:30.164, Speaker E: In my view, the ecosystem, or in general blockchain has matured enough. So what we start to see is the real world problems that it's starting to solve. So for us, for example, to be launching stablecoins on different, different chains, we needed to have started four or five years ago in order to get the licenses necessary, experience, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But what we see is that the requests from the ecosystems is to solve the real world problems. Kyc ML, you know, in web two, web3. So taking it to DeFi, stable coins, compatibility, creation of the traditional financial products. So what, in my view, this wave of the crypto winter will bring is real world examples which are very much resembling what we already see in the non blockchain world.
00:14:30.164 - 00:14:35.144, Speaker E: Coming to the blockchain and furthermore developing the blockchain ecosystems.
00:14:35.644 - 00:14:47.874, Speaker A: Praneeth, this is something I've been hearing a lot about, which is real world assets coming on chain. Is this actually becoming a reality or is it a talking point?
00:14:49.294 - 00:16:01.944, Speaker C: At least from what we've seen on the institutional side, not yet. There's definitely been interest, there's been some notion of progress as it relates to people's understanding of why, what it means to start thinking about issuance, about the lifecycle management of these kinds of assets. But there still seem to be gaps as it relates to the quality of assets that we're trying to bring on chain. And that is what is, at least from what we've seen, been keeping people back. But again, to that point, I guess if we are kind of seeing new ways of tokenizing even crypto native assets and actually thinking about associating value with things that were a lot more intangible, and so mechanisms that have been put in place have been helpful to define like a new class of assets, if one might call it that, terming it very loosely, but things that were pretty intangible have actually started taking shape, and that's what people have started thinking about giving value to.
00:16:02.564 - 00:16:08.864, Speaker A: Is there a specific real world asset that is maybe catching the most attention.
00:16:11.244 - 00:16:40.264, Speaker C: At least from a yield standpoint? Short d to t bills. So rates are high. It makes a ton of sense for people to look at DeFi rates and compare that to what, what's happening with t bills, and basically use that as an opportunity for people to migrate capital from DeFi, get arbitrage, and maybe use that as a basis to not just hedge the positions, but hopefully use that as a way to pump more capital back into crypto.
00:16:42.484 - 00:17:32.353, Speaker B: Katrina Rwas RWA admittedly is not a thesis focus of portal venture. However, I did notice the conversions of some deep end projects to RWA because depending on how you define it, decentralized physical infrastructure and real world asset like. Real world assets sometimes can be commodity like, whether it's storage or battery. And there are projects like tokenizing battery to provide early liquidity for the storage facilities because they, their pinpoint being, you know, they it's asset being there static for years. So those kind of intersection projects are interesting to look at. Though I would say overall it's quite early. And especially when it comes to real world verification, there's challenges there.
00:17:34.213 - 00:17:37.077, Speaker A: We're still early. Are we still early?
00:17:37.205 - 00:17:39.069, Speaker B: Only if I get a panty every time I hear that.
00:17:39.141 - 00:18:11.224, Speaker A: Yeah, we're somewhat maybe. I think we're getting to the point where we're like a little less early. You know, it's like getting less and less early. There might be some founders or people here who are starting companies or developers. What practical advice can we maybe impart upon them? From what you're seeing, maybe talking with the founders in your portfolio, Alex, what are top of mind concerns that maybe you're helping them navigate.
00:18:13.874 - 00:18:41.580, Speaker E: Both as a vc and as a founder? I think especially in a downturn, cash is the king. That's always cash is the king. Now it's for sure you may not leave to see your next round. So be very, very cautious. Team is the biggest asset. So you know, people invest into teams. If the first advice is more specifically to CEO, so this is what should keep him at night.
00:18:41.580 - 00:18:48.212, Speaker E: Do I have enough money? Do I have the right team? I think in general, the third advice is just try to build something.
00:18:48.268 - 00:18:49.060, Speaker C: What is your vision?
00:18:49.092 - 00:19:10.154, Speaker E: So what you've set out to do, of course you need to be flexible, pivots are happening, but at least try to test your thesis, try to achieve what you set out and only then try to deviate, et cetera, et cetera. This is probably three things. Be consistent, try to do it. That's the third thing. That's the advice to the founders.
00:19:11.414 - 00:19:12.514, Speaker A: What say you?
00:19:12.854 - 00:20:02.824, Speaker B: I always use the metaphor of what's growing the pie versus slicing the pie. And how I define that is slicing the pie is when you deliver incremental improvement to compete for existing use cases, customers and liquidity versus if it's growing the pie, you are creating net new customers and liquidity. So example of growing the pie recently I feel pretty interesting. I need to do a more technical deep dive. But SVM integration into Ethereum is very interesting. It's benefiting celestia risk zero Solana and enable more developers to be able to tap into the EVM liquidity. So that's a prime example of growing the pie versus, well, I won't name the example of what slicing they are definitely needed paying attention.
00:20:02.824 - 00:20:33.856, Speaker B: Well, the modular thesis, a lot of the time I won't say all of them, but it's slicing the pie a little bit. I did a deep dive into the MEV space and I think it's absolutely critical. But at the end of day it's slicing. And the parallel, I guess, in web two is sustaining innovation from Christian Christensen's innovator dilemma. So both are important. But one thing I personally focus on.
00:20:33.880 - 00:20:47.764, Speaker A: More than others, Tashar, what is a prime example you see of slicing the pie, to use Katrina's metaphor in this market?
00:20:48.904 - 00:20:50.044, Speaker D: That's a good question.
00:20:50.824 - 00:20:53.444, Speaker A: I've got lots of good questions.
00:20:54.504 - 00:21:37.566, Speaker D: I have an easy example, actually. I think what we've seen with the major NFT exchanges over the course of the bear market is very much an example of slicing the pie, where the number of NFT traders and drops and volume has all gone down. But we've seen in both the Ethereum ecosystem and the Solana ecosystem something play out the same exact thing. You saw this with Tensor taking over magic Eden in terms of market share, and you've seen this with blur taking over Opensea. And this is very much, in my opinion, something where you're slicing the pie, you're not bringing new people in and what are they competing on? It's trading fees. The fees are coming down and like.
00:21:37.630 - 00:21:40.194, Speaker A: 40,000 some odd people.
00:21:40.574 - 00:22:17.704, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know what the exact number of people is because you can see the number of addresses, not the number of people. And the stuff is easily symbolable, so who knows? But yeah, this is clearly compressing margins. And I'm not surprised that that's happening actually, because I think that at its core blockchain is about compressing margins. Everything is open source, everything is permissionless, way harder to maintain margins when everything is open source and permissionless. And we just saw this play out with a pretty big market in terms of NFT exchanges.
00:22:18.124 - 00:22:54.604, Speaker C: I'm just going to interject here and say, I mean, this is exactly the point I was speaking about at the start, that we have more information, more data points, we have more of an understanding in terms of how ecosystems have played out. And that in and of itself is extremely helpful in getting to understand and maybe inject and instill in developers mindsets that this is something that has actually played out. Why are you trying this out? I mean, it's good, up to you, but maybe there's other things I thought you could try to spend your energies and efforts on.
00:22:56.104 - 00:23:01.564, Speaker A: It's really interesting. So then how do we grow the pie?
00:23:03.224 - 00:24:09.874, Speaker E: Alex, that's a very interesting question. I think growth of the pie comes from a little bit of intuition, a little bit, or to a large extent knowledge of the market. Again, here you just need to try to understand, in the case of the current wave, what would be the real world cases that will attract more and more people to the blockchain. In the case where I work, stable coins, you just take and understand instability brings a lot more people than the people in the countries with weak financial systems simply to use stable coins because they have very few. So what you try to do, you try to create opportunities for them to easier go to the stable coins to save their assets, for example. So you just try to analyze the big picture, you see the big wave and then you try, try to understand what would drive people en masse to try to adopt something that is quite obvious. And I think that would grow the pie.
00:24:11.454 - 00:25:01.796, Speaker A: It's something that reminds me of your colleague Kyle. When we would talk about nfTs. He made the point of comparing it to what newspapers looked like in the nineties. When that medium first came online, it was effectively just the print paper on a webpage. And that was the first iteration. And it wasn't only until several years later that they evolved and became more dynamic. And if you kind of have people approach with NFTs just continuing to do that first iteration with PFPs and not necessarily evolve into other use cases, that's going to continue to cut the pie rather than expand it.
00:25:01.796 - 00:25:21.994, Speaker A: Are there any other examples you can think of that can grow maybe like a specific to use the NFT example, instead of coming on as an entrepreneur to do a new way of creating a marketplace, what else can you do that moves the pushes the envelope, as it were?
00:25:24.534 - 00:26:24.504, Speaker D: I don't know that I can comment on what pushes the envelope for the NFT market specifically, but more generally, sure, I think that the next bull cycle in crypto is going to be kicked off by people getting assets on chain without having to buy them. I think what we need are more users, and I think that we can't ask those users to go through the onboarding friction of buying assets. I think that's a huge amount of friction, and that friction's not going to go away. There's lots of companies working on smoothing that out, make the KYC process faster, make the payments easier. But you are still asking someone to go out of pocket to buy something. And I think that the next wave is going to be kicked off by people who get assets on chain without purchasing them. Whether that's going to be I get an NFT to a show ticket on chain.
00:26:24.504 - 00:27:18.104, Speaker D: I was going to buy the ticket anyway, but I get this NFT now, and now later on you can see that I've gone to five of your shows. So you give me priority access to purchase the good seats at your next show, or whether it's something in Deepin where really I just wanted to buy a dash cam, but I happen to also get a Solana wallet because I'm mapping for Hivemapper and I earned some tokens alongside this high quality dash cam that I have. Or you just send me a tip link and I don't have a wallet or anything. I just get $10 in USDC from you. You send me a link and it's smooth and I didn't buy buy it and now I will it use on chain services like Defi, not because I want to make money, but because it's the cheapest, easiest, fastest thing to do. And that's where I think we can really grow the pie.
00:27:19.124 - 00:27:56.646, Speaker A: It's also evident that you can't just, you can't it's hard to get people to spend money to onboard into crypto. It's also not very effective to give them money either. I mean, if we look at the data behind, I'm sure this data, you've looked at customer acquisition costs vis a vis airdrops and liquidity mining programs abysmal. I mean, the average CAC of an airdrop is like, I don't know what the average is, but I know that certain ones have been upwards of $10,000 per user. That's not sustainable. Agree with me.
00:27:56.830 - 00:27:58.514, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely.
00:28:00.214 - 00:28:06.582, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts on that, sir? I actually ventured into pontificating there for a second, so guilty of my own sin.
00:28:06.718 - 00:28:08.038, Speaker B: So what's the question again?
00:28:08.166 - 00:28:18.486, Speaker A: Do you think that in terms of acquiring customers, are customers users pathways of doing it, can they work, can they be altered? What you're thinking there?
00:28:18.590 - 00:28:55.838, Speaker B: Yeah, ultimately, users care about three things. Well, depend on retail or enterprise, enterprise care about top line or bottom line. Are you growing my revenue or you're saving my cost? And I actually think recent Shopify integration with Solana is super bullish, because now you're actually using blockchain for its purpose, to disintermediate and deliver higher efficiency. But from a retail side, they only care about cheaper, better, faster. So, yeah, all the CAC and airdrop, I think those are temporary. Those are important as any ecosystem. Bootstrap, it's kind of two sided market.
00:28:55.838 - 00:29:31.732, Speaker B: And this is the genesis of ICO in the era of 2017, is a technology needs someone to have skin the game to join the network, but that is temporary also to the point of all protocols. After they decentralize, they will reduce emission and have transaction fee to subsidize miner instead of block rewards. It's the same trend. But in the initial phase, I do think CAC is quite necessary, though. The definition of CAC to me is actually the marketing and sales budget. Because what is it? Well, I'm talking about protocol. What protocol is selling is block space.
00:29:31.732 - 00:29:41.504, Speaker B: And who's the consumer of block space? It's actually developers. That's why the CAC, in this sense, I think would be the marketing and bd to acquire more developer onto the network.
00:29:42.344 - 00:29:43.560, Speaker A: That's an interesting point.
00:29:43.672 - 00:29:44.584, Speaker D: If I can add something.
00:29:44.664 - 00:29:45.444, Speaker A: Yeah, please.
00:29:45.864 - 00:30:04.320, Speaker D: To your point about the CAC being really high due to these airdrops, I think there's actually a very good explanation for it, which is founders not putting enough Sibyl protection into their airdrops. And you have airdrop farmers who come.
00:30:04.352 - 00:30:06.644, Speaker A: In, I don't know any of those.
00:30:08.424 - 00:30:58.654, Speaker D: Here's the thing, it's really easy to turn a blind eye to it when you're on the team that's building the product that, hey, everyone likes it when numbers go up and everyone wants to see a huge number of users. It's easy to say, hey, look, we're growing, people love our product, and then stop thinking and stop wondering, wait, why are all these users using the same IP address? Why do they seem to transact in these very peculiar ways? And why have they never done anything else on any other protocol? People just stop asking themselves questions because they got the answer they wanted already. And that's what leads to really shitty cacs, where it's just, oh, yeah, well, you're airdropping all your tokens to these people, but turns out it's like one guy with a bunch of different attributes.
00:30:58.694 - 00:31:14.734, Speaker A: Frank, I'm in my basement, just sibling away. Where do we go from here? What are you most excited about, Alex? What's getting you out of bed and schlepping to Amsterdam?
00:31:15.914 - 00:32:25.990, Speaker E: Institutional adoption. I think the first signs, new LP's. Sorry, new LP's, that's in the past life as an entrepreneur, I think very, very fundamental change, boys. Mic adoption in Europe, and I see a hugely accelerated move of institutions, especially in the countries such as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, to less extent, but still moving towards trying crypto in earnest. Not paying leap service, not doing it for the corporate brochures, but in essence, really trying to understand how can they do business. And when institutions start to really try to understand how to do business, that means that sooner or later, let's say in five years, that would lead to results. And when large institutions do it, the results may be quite substantial.
00:32:25.990 - 00:32:32.114, Speaker E: So that's actually what is very, very exciting for me, Katrina.
00:32:33.254 - 00:32:39.434, Speaker B: I have a pretty contrarian one, and some people might laugh at me, but I've been doing a research on.
00:32:39.894 - 00:32:42.514, Speaker A: I'm not laughing at anything on Valium.
00:32:44.294 - 00:33:31.794, Speaker B: I've been doing a research on the revival of the BTC ecosystem to make it more capital efficient. Another lever is to make it more programmable. And there are different schools of thought, but the allure of three x DeFi liquidity, potentially to bring into the rest of DeFi, and also as a digital gold. How can we just like a panda, how do we have panda to have more panda babies? So we can have this store value, basically generate yield on BTC, if that's a possibility, and the underlying infrastructure needs to be built. And one example being during the height of ordinal mint binance have to integrate with lightning network because of the transaction fee being $20 to $100 per transaction. That's just not likely. Or, you know, that's just not feasible.
00:33:31.794 - 00:33:45.404, Speaker B: And with the upcoming catalyst of happening of the EFTM approval, you know, to your point of institutional, more attention to holding spot BTM spot BTC. So yeah, that's my curiosity lately.
00:33:49.224 - 00:34:55.424, Speaker C: I can try and reflect a contrarian view by saying I'm interested in blockchain, not crypto use cases where essentially thinking about the blockchain as a means for timestamping and having veracity of content or attestations, and having those be verified at a given point in time and space. And these, these forms of attestations could be about very simple facts, but they could also be about extremely complex programming systems, things that could live outside the domain of blockchains, things like, I don't know, like for instance, like a complex machine learning inference system. And then basically thinking about using the ledger as a way for us to actually stop thinking about the content we produce, the way we'll be using that. And essentially trying to actually underpin a notion of credentials that is as permissionless and trustless as it should be is something that truly excites me.
00:34:56.823 - 00:34:57.563, Speaker E: Perfect.
00:35:00.223 - 00:35:44.936, Speaker D: What am I excited about? The two things that I'm most excited about are payments and DPIn, because like I was saying earlier, it gets people to use on chain assets without having to buy those assets. Specifically. I like these crypto native use cases because to your analogy earlier about how newspapers went on the Internet, or another way to think about it is they used this thing called the phone book Yellow Pages. And you know what they did when the Internet came around? They put up yellowpages.com, and you could look up people's phone numbers using this. But actually that's not what search turned out to be. It turned out to be Google.
00:35:44.936 - 00:36:20.794, Speaker D: And I think you see this same thing here where it's like, you know, what we're going to do is we're going to take this bond and we're going to go put it on the blockchain. And to me that's like the same thing as yellowpages.com or like what the New York Times used to look like in 1995, just like it's the same newspaper but on the Internet. And so what I'm really interested in is like the new capital formation that happens through deepin rather than the incremental improvement. Now look, the incremental improvement is still an improvement, and it is valuable and it is good and we should still do it. It's just not what I'm intellectually excited about.
00:36:22.294 - 00:36:40.254, Speaker A: That's well said. I like that analogy better than Kyle's. So I guess you win. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that leaves us at time. We appreciate you coming out, taking the time to listen. We'll see you out there at the conference. Thank you.
