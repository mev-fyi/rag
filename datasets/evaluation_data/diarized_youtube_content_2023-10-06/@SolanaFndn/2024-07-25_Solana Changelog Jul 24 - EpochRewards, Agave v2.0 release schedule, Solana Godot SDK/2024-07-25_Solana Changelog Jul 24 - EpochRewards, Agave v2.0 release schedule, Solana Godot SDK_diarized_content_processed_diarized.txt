00:00:03.720 - 00:00:11.246, Speaker A: Hello everyone. GMGM. Welcome to the Solana Changelog. I'm Nick from the Solana foundation devrel team, and today I've got jonas with me from the devrel team. How you doing, jonas?
00:00:11.318 - 00:00:13.118, Speaker B: Hello. I'm doing great. How are you?
00:00:13.294 - 00:00:14.894, Speaker A: I'm doing zupa.
00:00:15.062 - 00:00:16.086, Speaker B: Super good.
00:00:16.238 - 00:00:36.192, Speaker A: Yeah, zupa gut. Let's go ahead and dive into the changelog. We got some interesting stuff this week. First thing I want to talk about is this simd. SIMD 75 got merged in. This relates to the precompiles one we talked about last week. But specifically, if you notice here, this is the sec p 256 r1 curve.
00:00:36.192 - 00:00:55.940, Speaker A: If you think back to the changelog last week I mentioned this. This is the curve that is used by Fido passkey. So things like yubikeys and those hardware devices, this curve, now that the SIMD has been approved, we'll be able to have eventually native curve support within the Solana runtime for this. So that's pretty awesome.
00:00:56.080 - 00:01:12.436, Speaker B: Yeah, that's super cool. Very exciting. And this is like a very, very old one, actually. I found it kind of confusing, but now it has finally been merged. Right. Stuff also gets more complicated now, right. That we have Anza and fire dancer, and they both need to agree if we do stuff now.
00:01:12.436 - 00:01:15.600, Speaker B: So adding a new curve is still like a big deal, right?
00:01:15.980 - 00:01:29.062, Speaker A: Yeah, they definitely needed the approval from both of the core engineering teams for both of those clients. But also I think they were waiting on the interface design that the last precompile SIMD kind of proposed and actually got merged in.
00:01:29.206 - 00:01:32.462, Speaker B: Yeah, super cool. And did you see any other nice commits?
00:01:32.606 - 00:01:58.282, Speaker A: Yeah, there were some. There was not a whole lot of interesting commits this week. I will shout out this one because like documentation, which I love, this is from cries of tiara from the Anza core engineering team, and it's updating the documentation for the new epoch rewards this far. So all of the amazing work that she has been doing and the other engineers have been doing for the epoch rewards, it's clarified in the documentation how the new stuff works. So give it a read.
00:01:58.426 - 00:02:18.458, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you're wondering why there are not so many commits, like, let's look at the release schedule. Yeah. Now we need to sync always with Fire Dancer. And there are some plans apparently to feature freeze basically before breakpoint, and then after Breakpoint, version 2.0 will be released.
00:02:18.554 - 00:02:36.126, Speaker A: Yep, yep. This is the official version 2.0 release schedule. A lot of the deprecation things that we've talked about recently, those are going to start going away once 2.0 hits mainnet and all the respective clusters, people have been asking for the date. Here's the official date from Anza.
00:02:36.278 - 00:02:45.370, Speaker B: Yeah, again, if you had some problems with the 2.0 updates, I think there were some problems in the JavaScript SDKs ping us because I think they should be all fixed now.
00:02:45.830 - 00:02:46.638, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:46.814 - 00:03:42.156, Speaker B: All right, we had the game jam recently and some cool things that came out of it is tooling improvements. So we have the Godot SDK, which is super cool. Now, the maintainer tumukas one made a really nice video series about it, ten videos where you can just go through and learn how to build a game in Godot. And then there's also something which is actually cool, not only for games, because Danny built actually Idl two C converters. You can just take the JSON idlite and you get a complete c client which works with Unreal five point x. And yeah, I saw his presentation at the London hacker house and it was really cool because he had a character which looked amazing, unreal rendering, and he was aiming to moving left and right using the tiny adventure program that's already deployed. So I think it was really, really cool stuff.
00:03:42.308 - 00:03:57.640, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I was actually, on a personal note, I was diving into watching a bunch of dev content for Godot. Very approachable, very simple, looks kind of like a python y type scripting language. And you build full games. So maybe, maybe I'll tinker more.
00:03:57.720 - 00:04:16.342, Speaker B: Yeah, there were a bunch of cool games actually for the game jam built with Godot, and they have lots of stuff coming like they want to import, include Honeycomb, compressed nfts, the soar magic block program, metaplex auctions, and so on. So yeah, if you're a godot developer, try it out. It's really, really good.
00:04:16.496 - 00:04:32.634, Speaker A: Yeah, let's go. All right, let's go shift over to the last but not least stack exchange. Shout out to all the amazing people on stack exchange, helping out everyone, answering questions. We've got Ari, Jimmy Sirbon, got John Cinque, of course, white seal. Great work, everybody on stack exchange.
00:04:32.722 - 00:04:37.750, Speaker B: Yeah, and many new people as well. And Ari is just such a beast. It's amazing. Really good.
00:04:38.970 - 00:04:42.026, Speaker A: All right, that's going to wrap it up for this changelog and we'll catch you in the next one.
00:04:42.138 - 00:04:42.922, Speaker B: See you next week. Bye.
