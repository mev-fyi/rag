00:00:05.800 - 00:00:08.685, Speaker A: Chris, Joel, welcome to Validated.
00:00:09.265 - 00:00:10.445, Speaker B: Thanks, Austin.
00:00:11.065 - 00:00:11.965, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:00:12.425 - 00:00:56.383, Speaker A: Yeah. So excited to have you guys on today. I think, you know, Chris Praninsky, you are a little bit of maybe a legend in this space, and not for the reasons most people, I think are legends in this space because they created a protocol like Vitalik or they're infamous like some of the other people who are very famous in this space. But in my time in crypto, there is one name that continually comes up as the person that someone talked to who sold them on crypto, who got them adopted in the vision. And so you are one of, I would say, our most requested guests that we've had on the list for a while. And Placeholder as a firm is a place we've been very curious about for a while. So thank you to both for coming on today.
00:00:56.519 - 00:01:05.487, Speaker B: Thanks, Austin. I just channel everything that Joel tells me to the public, and so I'm the Joel interpreter and then proceeds to.
00:01:05.511 - 00:01:07.075, Speaker C: Give me way too much credit.
00:01:07.455 - 00:01:34.961, Speaker A: Love it. So maybe we can actually start off there. I want to get into sort of some of your visions on crypto, personally, your visions on Solana, your firm's perspective on it. But I think we don't usually get two partners at a firm on a show, and we also try and steer away from investors in general on the show. So why don't we start off with how do you guys think about division of labor within side of Placeholder? How did this sort of whole thing come about and how does it operate today?
00:01:35.153 - 00:02:22.671, Speaker C: So maybe we should go into how the firm came together and maybe going maybe. The year before we started Placeholder, Chris was working at Ark Invest, which is a public asset manager run by Cathie Wood, who a lot of people know. And then I was working for a venture capital firm called the Union Square Ventures. We were both in New York, and we connected after an NYC, an NYU blockchain conference back in, what was it, 2016. And what was interesting was that we were both looking at the same thing. We were both very curious about the technology, but I was coming at it from the venture capital side and Chris was coming at it from the public market side. And I at the time had essentially no real awareness of public markets.
00:02:22.671 - 00:03:18.921, Speaker C: I just didn't think about that at all. I only thought about the technology from the venture perspective and the startup perspective. And Chris was coming and thinking about the technology from the asset perspective and the public markets perspective. And so that, I think, sparked a lot of our mutual interest in sharing what we knew from our sides of the World and quickly became friends and spent a lot of time learning from each other really. And then in 2017, when it came to get, when we decided to get the firm started, we had to make decisions about how to structure it. And so we knew that the space was volatile enough that a venture capital structure would be ideal for managing the volatility over really long periods of time. But we also knew that a lot of the opportunity came from the public market side of things.
00:03:18.921 - 00:04:14.945, Speaker C: And so we came up with this sort of hybrid where we have a venture capital structure and a venture capital approach in many of the ways in which we invest, for example, in startups and private companies, but also with a public market practice that works alongside it. And so that was one of the kind of innovative ideas at the time that we brought to the table in terms of how that bubbled into how the firm works. Chris is the most knowledgeable on public markets. I had the most experience on the venture capital side. And we both do a bit of everything. But with Chris mostly focusing or focusing more on the market side and I'm focusing more on the private transactions mechanically. Now there are names that Chris has a venture portfolio and a liquid asset portfolio.
00:04:14.945 - 00:04:27.225, Speaker C: I have a venture portfolio and a liquid asset portfolio. It's not like they're separate. We both work together on all the names, but we rely on each other, on each other's areas of expertise.
00:04:27.585 - 00:04:48.849, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm kind of curious how that works together. You talk to some folks in VC and they're sort of like, oh, the liquid token fund component doesn't make any sense. You talk to people who are fully liquid token people and they say venture makes no sense. It's so hard to predict the future. I think there's like a version of that that often comes out where there's some firms that dabble in both. Right.
00:04:48.849 - 00:05:24.935, Speaker A: They have a venture arm, they have a liquid arm. And you know, a lot of them, it often feels like they sort of have soft conviction about everything that they're not. You know, when you're making an investment that's fully private market, you generally need to be confident for a long number of years. You're going to hold a specific asset. A little bit less true in crypto, but liquidity can often be harder to get in that early stage, whereas on the liquid side, people often assume these are sort of very short hold duration periods. So how do you guys think about balancing what can from the outside seem like two pretty contradictory strategies for generating long term returns?
00:05:25.395 - 00:05:51.287, Speaker B: Sure. And I think this has evolved for Us too, over time. But just to underscore something that Joel said when we came to market in 2017 with the idea that we're going to have a venture fund structure that would hold both liquid assets and private investments. That at the time was a unique idea because at that point you had hedge funds doing purely liquid assets.
00:05:51.371 - 00:05:51.663, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:51.719 - 00:06:30.277, Speaker B: And you had venture funds purely doing private investments. Right. And I would say now people have come around more to this idea that you can have both in a venture fund, or at least firms have tried to integrate both practices. I would say for us in our current form, and there's been a lot of learnings to get to this place, but when we are buying assets, we're looking at them for multi year holds. Right. Could be anywhere from three to ten years, let's say. And for the most part, we've developed a practice where we understand what a good valuation is.
00:06:30.277 - 00:07:33.201, Speaker B: And a lot of our internal work is keeping ourselves sane in what can be an insane industry and saying, okay, this is a really interesting opportunity, but it's overpriced and so it's not a good investment to make. And so we end up becoming a form of distressed asset buyers in the public markets. And so we do a lot of our accumulation work in distress times, like late 22 or first half of 2023. And then that also feeds into a lot of our private market work where, you know, for example, the last bear market, the primary focus of the firm was Solana. And so we're underwriting a lot of deals in the Solana ecosystem. So, you know, it started with Orca, but you know, ended up adding Tensor and Drip and Squads and Jito and a number of other names. But those deals keep informing our distressed asset buys in the public markets.
00:07:33.201 - 00:08:15.139, Speaker B: Right. And so it keeps feeding in and then once the public markets lift, the feedback loop is so quick in crypto into private market valuations that often it cools our pace of investing. And so this is where I'd say increasingly over time we have become more cyclical as an investor, understanding when it's a good time to be a buyer and when it's a good time to be a seller. And really I think of it as being a liquidity provider in the truest sense of in a bear market, everyone's selling and so you need some buyers. And then in a bull market, if everyone's buying, then you need some sellers and so you're providing liquidity where it's needed most.
00:08:15.307 - 00:08:42.299, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's, it's an interesting way to think about it, there's sort of this idea of like, oh, there's a, you know, there's a fire sale on Bitcoin and Ethereum and Seoul every few years. Right. Markets. Markets take a significant drop and the smart folks and the smart firms acquire at that point. But that can be a very hard thing to know. Both. Have we actually hit the dip or is this the meme of the dip? The dip, the dip.
00:08:42.299 - 00:09:22.815, Speaker A: And there's a lot of people who picked up a lot of assets. What they thought was the bottom in early 2022, which ended up the actual bottom ended up being late 2022. So how do you think about some of those structures? And there's a component of venture capital that I wouldn't necessarily say is easier than the public market stuff, but you make a bet, you invest at one specific point. You usually don't have the option to sell or the option to do this sort of weekly or monthly trading that you do in the liquid side of things. So how did the convictions or your market sense in one side of the business inform actions on the other side?
00:09:23.195 - 00:10:05.993, Speaker C: I'm happy to lead with that one because there's, there's actually something that goes back to the decision to structure the funds as venture capital funds because the, maybe for people who are, who are a bit unfamiliar. And we wrote a blog post about this a number of years ago on our website called Crypto Hedge Funds versus Venture Capital Funds that talks a little bit about the differences in the fund structure and how that leads to different investing behaviors. Not making a judgment about which one's better and which one's worse. They're just used for different purposes. And the unique qualities of a, of a venture fund are you raise an amount of money. You don't get that amount of money all at once. You, you call that amount of money over time.
00:10:05.993 - 00:10:52.161, Speaker C: And so our funds are usually around $150 million. We get $150 million worth of commitments and then we're expected to call about 70% of those funds over a, say, roughly three year period. So that creates a natural barrier to how quickly you can deploy capital and how you spread your investments over time. And then that has an influence in how you then make your investments over time. And so a hedge fund is more mostly thinking about rebalancing the portfolio. They usually have all the money up front and then you're buying and selling in a, you know, kind of ongoing basis. But for a venture fund, we're calling the portfolio.
00:10:52.161 - 00:11:51.127, Speaker C: So there's a phase of building it and then there's a phase of then letting that portfolio mature and then generating liquidity from it. And so that really prevents us from falling into short term temptations of, you know, it doesn't really make sense for us to buy an asset to then try to sell it nine months later because there's restrictions on what happens when you sell an asset. It's expected that you're going to return that capital to investors or at least there's a cap on how much we can recycle, which is usually about 20%. And so we really can't engage in the same liquidity strategies that a hedge fund does. But that's not our goal. So there are times where a hedge fund strategy for hedge fund managers, you absolutely need that structure. For us, when it comes to dealing with the cyclicality of the market, it means that it actually forces us to spread our buying activity over a period of time so we don't have to nail the bottom.
00:11:51.127 - 00:12:32.869, Speaker C: Exactly. We do just, you know, great enough doing, you know, spreading our buys over 2, 3/4 to accumulate an asset. And often what you'll see is that we, most of the time we actually start buying far from the bottom. And so if you take sort of a U shape, we might start buying, let's say that a bottoming process takes three quarters. Just to use an example, we might start buying in the first quarter, you know, continue buying or accelerate our buying during a bottom. And then as long as we have an opportunity to continue averaging down our cost basis, then we'll continue to use that opportunity. So for us that involves a lot of planning.
00:12:32.869 - 00:13:04.135, Speaker C: So when we have decided that we want to accumulate a position in a given name, Chris and I will sit together and think about what is the valuation that we're willing to pay for this name. Where do we think we might be able to get those prices, what kind of position size or investment size we think is appropriate. And based on those parameters, then we can think about, okay, at this price level we'll buy this much. If it goes down to this price level, we'll buy this much more and so on.
00:13:04.835 - 00:13:05.395, Speaker A: Yep.
00:13:05.475 - 00:13:41.939, Speaker B: And that's, that's a really key point there. The, the trunch in tables of like at this price we have this amount of dry powder for this asset and at this price, this amount. And just, you know, to take Ethereum, which we focus on in the 1819 bear, and then Solana, which we focus on in the 22, 23 bear. In the 1819 bear, Ethereum bottomed at about 80 bucks, that was about a 9.6 billion FDV. Right. This last bear, 2223 Sol bottomed at 758 bucks, which was about 4 to 5 billion FDV.
00:13:41.939 - 00:14:10.099, Speaker B: Right. And so what gave us conviction at a point when there were a lot of people calling us, being like, is SOL ever going to stop going down? Right. Is. Okay. Seoul is now trading at 50% beneath Ethereum's bottom valuation in 1819. But the quality of the entrepreneurs and the Dapps that we see being built and the likely future fundamentals are likely to match that of Ethereum at that point in time. Right.
00:14:10.099 - 00:14:59.951, Speaker B: And so you're getting this thing on fire sale. But the key I think for people to understand is because, because I think sometimes crypto, Twitter, um, you know, they think of crypto fund managers as, you know, perfect or nailing the bottom or, you know, whatever. But it's exactly what Joel said of like buying through a, uh, buying through a bottom. If you have super high conviction or sometimes if you have slightly lower conviction and you're gonna have a smaller position size, you can try and buy the second half. So buy from the bottom onwards. What we find there is you can sometimes get a better entry price, but often your position size is more limited because you get ripped upwards. And so if you want a really big position size, you're better off buying the U.
00:14:59.951 - 00:15:25.315, Speaker B: And if you are more tactically focused and you're not as worried about the position size, the second half of the U, you know, is suitable, but you are at risk of being undersized. And the last thing I'll say here is like, sizing of the position is just as important, if not more important, to end outcomes. If you're right, then like the perfect entry price.
00:15:25.975 - 00:15:35.967, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. Like if you have high conviction about it, it doesn't matter if you get it at 12 or 20, it matters if you have 10 million or 50 million. Yep, yeah, interesting.
00:15:35.991 - 00:15:36.755, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:15:37.405 - 00:16:13.365, Speaker A: So I want to talk a little bit. You mentioned that somewhere in 2223 bear, you guys developed this sort of very high conviction thesis on the future of Solana. How did that develop? And this was also a time when many people even beforehand weren't really treating Solana as a first class digital asset. There was sort of the idea that, oh, there's Bitcoin, Ethereum and then the L2s are predestined and everything else is too frothy. We don't know if Solana or Polkadot or Cardano or whatever is going to actually Work, work. How did you end up developing this conviction on the future of Solana?
00:16:13.945 - 00:16:36.315, Speaker B: Well, it went back to 2017, when Joel first sent me the white paper by Tully. And I remember Joel being like, whoa, this is a Qualcomm engineer that's launching or is thinking about a layer one. And that was in the 2017 ICO frenzy, I believe it was.
00:16:36.505 - 00:16:41.595, Speaker C: And yeah, we didn't even call them layer ones because there were no L2s.
00:16:42.335 - 00:17:18.073, Speaker B: Yeah. And that was the white paper era. Right. Like you nerd out on the white paper. And then, you know, in 1819, we were really focused on Ethereum and we built a venture portfolio of a lot of blue chip defi names and other names around Ethereum in 1819. And I would also say, um, we were more venture focused in our mindset of like a. A more traditional venture firm will invest in a single name that is supposed to be the category winner.
00:17:18.073 - 00:18:15.741, Speaker B: Whereas I think what we've realized over time is, especially with public market entries, so you can have multiple names that complement each other, especially if you're not involved at the board level or a more competitive level where you're getting, you know, material information directly from the founders. You know, a Solana position can complement an Ethereum position, whereas in 1819 we were more like Ethereum's the focus. And let's do everything around Ethereum, but we're still watching Solana. We actually had conversations with Toly and Raj about Solana in 2020, decided to not make the investment, but kept watching it. And then we made an entry into the Solana ecosystem with Orca, was our first investment. And that's an example of making a private investment at relatively small size, but with a quality team. And we knew Utaro because he had worked at UMA, which was a portfolio name from Fund 1.
00:18:15.741 - 00:18:51.115, Speaker B: He had worked at the Ethereum foundation as a. As a researcher. And so it meant a lot to us that he had cut his teeth on Ethereum and then was able to educate us a lot about why he, as a quality entrepreneur, was choosing Solana. Right. And so that conversation was continuing internally. And so, you know, we've gone 2017 now all the way to 2021, still talking internally here and there about Solana, establish a venture position. And then, you know, it was a continuous stream of deal flow from, from quality entrepreneurs that I say really kept that conversation alive for us.
00:18:51.115 - 00:19:45.749, Speaker B: And it was inescapable how Strong Soul's performance was in 2021. Right. So we're watching that. I would also say, frankly, from my side, you know, just on a personal basis, I was somewhat triggered by the solana army in 2020 and 2021. And the first reaction to getting triggered is anger. The second reaction, which is more trained, I would say, as a professional investor now is like, okay, why am I getting triggered? Like, why is this threatening? Right. And so then that leads to further conversation and then I'm going to pass it to Joel now on say, you know, some of the formulation around how we started to see Solana as differentiated from Ethereum or you know, additive to what Ethereum brought.
00:19:45.749 - 00:19:52.305, Speaker B: Because Joel published a great piece on Solana vs vs Ethereum that will outline more of these thoughts.
00:19:53.285 - 00:21:23.915, Speaker C: Well, it isn't really about versus Ethereum as much as and Ethereum and sort of looking at both ecosystems and how they complement each other. Before I go into that, I want to underscore something that Chris said because it's the process that we went through with Solana is the process that we go through for all of the high conviction public market names. It's the same process that we went through with Ethereum, which is that the venture portfolio then leads the conviction in the platforms. In our first fund, we first started investing in the Ethereum ecosystem as venture investors and then through working with those entrepreneurs, we developed a conviction in Ethereum at the time and then we started building the Ethereum position. Same thing with Solana, where it's working with the entrepreneurs that gives us the conviction in the platform that they pick. And so when you meet, you know, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 really high quality companies that choose a platform, even if you only invest in a handful of them, you learn a lot about the platform and you learn a lot about, you know, their, their choices through, through the diligence process. And that's something that's become part of how we take advantage of the structure of the funds as a venture capital firm that also has a public asset practice to then build those portfolios in, in that way.
00:21:23.915 - 00:22:34.705, Speaker C: So by the time that we got to Solana, we had, we were very impressed with the quality of the entrepreneurs in the ecosystem. We were talking to a lot of startups in the Solana space, especially post ftx, is when you really get to see the grit and the commitment that teams had in the underlying technology. And then another important variable is at that time we were seeing that level of quality evaluations that were 50 to 80% below their comps in Ethereum land. And so as a venture capital investor, we were looking at Solana deals, say private deals in the companies in the $10 million valuation range when a similar quality team on Ethereum would be trying to raise money at 50 to $100 million valuations in the middle of a bear market. And so that became a pretty obvious calculation for us and a risk reward perspective for both the underlying platform and the companies that we're building on top of it.
00:22:35.485 - 00:22:36.037, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:36.141 - 00:23:46.795, Speaker C: When it came to thinking about Solana and Ethereum, one sort of historical analog that came to mind was seeing how the Android and the iOS ecosystems emerged. And. And it's less about comparing Ethereum to Android or Solana to iOS directly. It's more about what are some of the essential qualities that each approach to solving a problem brings to the table and what are they good for? And Android went for a modular distributed architecture where you have a single operating system that can be modified and tweaked depending on the use case, but that runs on devices manufactured by lots of different people or lots of different companies, or around the world. And that felt a lot like the Ethereum paradigm of, you know, the Ethereum virtual machine is the operating system, but it runs on blockchains manufactured by lots of different teams for lots of different use cases. And that allowed Android to become the mo, the most popular operating system in the world. It runs on everything from cell phones to televisions and cars.
00:23:46.795 - 00:24:42.631, Speaker C: On the other hand, Apple, of course, has a very integrated approach and that allows for a very refined user experience because they're able to control all the variables. It's highly performant phones and people get a consistent experience. And that's what you get with Solana. You don't have to think about bridges or transferring assets from one L2 to another, or dealing with the friction of deploying the same smart contract on slightly different versions of the evm, et cetera. And neither is good nor bad. They're just different people or different segments of the market gravitate towards different architectures. What we saw in the mobile world is, at least early on, the iPhone ecosystem would get the best applications first because it was easier to build on, and then they would expand and deploy on Android, and then they would have the resources to build for both.
00:24:42.631 - 00:25:11.949, Speaker C: We're starting to see something like that in crypto, where applications are becoming increasingly multi chain as the technologies mature and it becomes easier for you to deploy an app that runs on both Solana and Ethereum. There's various technologies that have been coming to market that enable that. So it's a very similar progression, but at the end of the day, the market is split between the two approaches, and we don't think that any single approach is a win or take all they just cater to different values.
00:25:12.117 - 00:25:37.765, Speaker A: Yeah. So when you were looking at the Solana ecosystem you mentioned entrepreneurs and projects were a major component of like, what convinced you there was, there was something here for the long term. What did you see that was Solana specific? Because there were a lot of ecosystems at the time that they had lots of people building on them, they had lots of developer numbers, they had lots of new projects launching on them. But it sounds like there was something different about what you saw in Solana.
00:25:38.425 - 00:27:24.321, Speaker C: The main thing for us was the quality of the user experiences, which matches this observation about what we were seeing in Ethereum and what we were seeing on Solana. And it's a similar, again a similar dynamic to what was going on in early iOS and Android, where what we saw on the venture side of things is that Ethereum based teams had to invest more money and developer resources on managing the complexities and the limitations of Ethereum at the expense of the user experience. And so you had to hire a layer 2 engineer to deploy the L2, you had to do more work around, say, auditing the smart contracts to deal with some of the flaws or issues with solidity, et cetera. In contrast, the teams that we were seeing on Solana were developing very high quality user experiences with very minimal resources. A great example here is the Tensor team, which probably exemplifies the extreme of efficiency in this case, where two young guys delivered one of the more successful applications in crypto at the time, which had a supreme user experience compared to things that we were seeing on Ethereum. Teams that were on Ethereum that raised a hundred times more money and had teams that were 20 times the size, but then had to spend a lot of those resources optimizing for the infrastructure instead of optimizing for the user experience is that that was at the time very specific to Solana, and that is also related to the valuations and the amounts of money that that these teams had to raise to get a product to market. Tensor raised very little money and got a product to market very quickly.
00:27:24.321 - 00:27:30.445, Speaker C: And we just hadn't seen that kind of combination of both speed to market and quality of application in Ethereum.
00:27:31.225 - 00:28:19.981, Speaker B: The only thing I'd add to there, Austin, is early Ethereum. A lot of the people building on Ethereum were in love with Ethereum. Yeah, and they were in love with it from an ideological, often optimistic perspective. But like, there was a real joy to hearing someone nerd out about what they could do. I would say that we experienced a similar love from a lot of people building on Solana and it was a different flavor than the Ethereum love. Like I would say it was kind of a more hardware based love or like a more engineering based love than ideological optimistic love. But there is still a fondness and like this is my place and I can only do these things here.
00:28:19.981 - 00:28:58.381, Speaker B: And you know, it got exemplified. Joel mentioned after FTX that was a real turning point for us in a positive way when I think a lot of the market took it a negative way. I was speaking with a team and I asked them, okay, FTX has happened. What does that mean for your commitment to Solana? And they said a month ago I would have given you a hedge answer of we'll look at all the different environments and maybe we'll choose this environment if it's better for us in the future. But now. And he's an expletive, there's no way I'm leaving Solana. Right.
00:28:58.381 - 00:29:14.505, Speaker B: And so that type of commitment you didn't really see in any other layer one environment like it was maybe Ethereum, Cosmos and Solana where I saw that kind of fondness.
00:29:16.005 - 00:29:59.167, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, the, the company you mentioned about something like Tensor raising not a lot of money, getting to market with a product of testing and produce. It feels like there used to be more of this in crypto in general. Do you think that's, that's accurate? It seems like a lot of teams are now raising very large rounds in private markets. They're going to market on very high valuations and the pace of innovation seems like it might be slowing down. I've never really attributed that to Solana's architecture as opposed to its culture. But it's interesting to hear you guys talk about this as there might be some underlying architectural reasons that you're seeing that fast innovation on Solana.
00:29:59.167 - 00:30:02.319, Speaker A: Do you think that's accurate or what do you see as going into this?
00:30:02.487 - 00:30:53.853, Speaker C: I think that's probably right. And there's a variety of factors that influence that phenomenon and maybe we can go through it basically one by one. One thing to remember is the extreme amount of hacks and lost funds that happened in Ethereum land over the past several years where a lot of people lost a lot of money. I think the, the, the, the number is probably in the billions now of how many funds have been lost to hacks. And especially in Defi land, which was a lot of the early use cases on Ethereum. And so it, yes, it used to be that in 2018. I mean, it even goes back to the DAO, the original DAO on Ethereum that got hacked pretty quickly afterwards.
00:30:53.853 - 00:32:04.209, Speaker C: And so that spawned, correctly, an industry on auditing smart contracts, being very careful with how you deploy them and so on and so forth. And all of those things require quite a bit of capital. And so I think part of the problem is how much you had to invest in security, because two junior engineers don't necessarily have the experience in writing extremely secure code to handle billions of dollars in TVL for a DeFi protocol. And so that requires a level of expertise and a level of talent that is very expensive and consumes a lot of time and resources. So as the industry matured on Ethereum land, I think that increased the cost of development, particularly in the defi sector. For less critical applications like more fun NFTs, for example, or games or things like that, it may not be as necessary, but the cost of hacks ultimately shows up in the cost of development or the consequences of that. And we see that in the development cycles for teams.
00:32:04.209 - 00:33:21.243, Speaker C: It's something that would happen early on is you would build your application and you'd write all your solidity smart contracts and you maybe had to wait three to six months to wait to get it audited by a reputable firm, because that reputable firm had a long list, a long waiting list of entrepreneurs looking to get their contracts audited. And then you couldn't afford the risk to launch and test in prod and have your contracts fail and have all your users leave and egg on face and your project is over. Solana and other blockchains as well, that have come sort of after Ethereum do make it easier to write more secure smart contracts than solidity does out of the gate. And so in some ways, and I'm sure there's a lot of people who would love to debate that, and that's a subject for a podcast unto itself. But in some ways, for example, Solana using Rust. Rust is a more difficult language to work with, but once you can work with it, it does help you write applications in a more elegant and secure way. Same for novel virtual machines like Move, which have some embedded security features.
00:33:21.243 - 00:33:34.635, Speaker C: And so the effect of that is that it becomes easier and cheaper for less good developers to deliver high quality applications. And that's an essential quality of a maturing space.
00:33:35.175 - 00:34:19.225, Speaker B: Another thing I think about here, Austin, is just because you can raise a lot of money doesn't mean you should. And at least in a lot of placeholders, early conversations about blockchain infrastructure. And I'd encourage people to read the thesis summary we put out in 2017 18, which laid a lot of the foundations of our thought. But a lot of the blockchain layer infrastructure is like a public commons cloud. Right. That outsources a lot of the OPEX and capex required for application builders. Right.
00:34:19.225 - 00:35:26.475, Speaker B: And the consumer pays for a lot of the operations, Whereas in a Web2 environment, an application pays for more of the underlying infrastructure. And so what that means is high quality global applications, you can build them and distribute them at much lower cost on blockchain infrastructure than on Web2 infrastructure. And I think that, you know, the reason people raise a lot is because they can and because VCs like the idea of early liquidity tokens or VCs and you know, there's all these perverted behaviors that result. But I think we would love to see a world where teams raise very small amounts of money to launch experimental applications, give the public much earlier access to those tokens at 10, 20, 30 million FTVs, maybe even lower. I don't know, I, I think there's enough, I think the pendulum is swinging enough away from, you know, large raises, flashy names, high FTVs. And I would love to see it. And the momentum is there already.
00:35:26.475 - 00:35:48.025, Speaker B: To see some regulatorily compliant form of ICO or public fundraising mechanism at lower valuations that gets users involved earlier, gives people that upside because it's totally possible. It's just a matter of how do you do it in a way that's going to also keep you out of hot water with the law.
00:35:48.645 - 00:36:29.035, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. So speaking of fundraisers, you guys obviously have seen a huge number of round configurations invested in a ton of companies, passed on, even more, evaluated, lots more than that. What advice do you have for founders who are going out and maybe they're building something that's not necessarily your classic infrastructure project, but is not like a pump fun style, fully consumer facing product. How do you think they should be approaching raises over the next kind of six, nine months in this kind of condition we're seeing right now of this kind of crab market with a lot of uncertainty about how things are going to be moving forwards?
00:36:29.775 - 00:37:17.237, Speaker B: Sure, I can kick it off. Um, I would say. And I'm going to just make it more universal. Yeah, I think, you know, starting if you go from like, let's say it's the first time you're raising money, right. And you're a fresh entrepreneur trying something new, do the first pitches with friends and family and build your way up in consequence, like we even noticed this on the placeholder side, our pitches, because we have to, you know, fundraise ourselves, our pitches get better the more we do them. And so starting with lower consequence and building up and you don't start with a perfect pitch or a perfect deck from, you know, day one. It's an iterative process.
00:37:17.237 - 00:38:11.565, Speaker B: And so iterating and having a path of iteration and working your way maybe to the final firms that you really would love to get and pitching them in a way last I think is useful. The other thing is if you get a term sheet very quickly and you're feeling pressure from someone, you as the entrepreneur are in the driver's seat. So there's no reason to succumb to that pressure and be like, I have to take this term sheet. Because chances are if you get a term sheet quickly, it means an investor is seeing something promising, they really want it, you know, and so that gives you leverage. And so you shouldn't succumb to their pressure. You should use that to your advantage. Because a mistake that we see is especially for first time entrepreneurs, if they built something quality, they'll take two or too early a deal.
00:38:11.565 - 00:38:51.369, Speaker B: Basically on predatory terms. Right. And a trick that I would say people will play is they'll say if you mark a network one to one with the company, because there's often a valuation of the company and evaluation of a network, then you can give the entrepreneur a higher equity valuation. But it means the VC is buying a lot of the network. So let's say a VC wants to invest 2 million at 10 million for the company. That's normal in VentureLand, you buy 20% of the company. But if it's one to one with the network, it implies they're buying 20% of the network.
00:38:51.369 - 00:39:44.299, Speaker B: If that ends up being huge, a very valuable network that's massive, that's three times bigger than any position placeholder would be comfortable having in ownership of a network. Right. We, we, we believe as a firm, I would say that you really shouldn't go past 10% and even that is pushing ownership of a network for any single entity. So that's another key one. And then I think the last thing is understanding some of the momentum and social dynamics of a deal. So even though I'm talking about, you know, building up to the people that you want to pitch the most over time and also like not feeling pressure with a term sheet, there is this type of process where you're kind of like building to a crescendo. Right.
00:39:44.299 - 00:40:19.055, Speaker B: And so you want to manage the pace of that. So you do want to be getting back to people quickly. You do want to show pace. We will even observe the pace at which entrepreneurs work in the pitching process as representative of the pace at which they'll operate. Right. And so these are all indicators, like almost everything matters in how you're approaching because we get such a thin slice to diligence people, and we have to extrapolate from that thin slice. And so we are looking at as many of the details as we can pick up on.
00:40:19.875 - 00:41:23.235, Speaker C: I think all of that is right. And the only thing to add is one area where entrepreneurs often make some errors is in how to anchor valuation expectations. At the beginning of a negotiation or during a fundraising process, and especially when the broader market is very competitive or very hot, there's often a temptation to want to come out and initiate the conversations at very high valuations and very substantial races. Or maybe they may not feel that high in the moment because you look to your left, so and so raised $60 million at, you know, a billion. You look to your right, so and so raised $100 million at 200. And you look at your team and you look at your project and you say, well, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm worth at least 100. If so and so raised at 200 and so, it can be very tempting to go out and try to initiate conversations with that, with setting a high expectations.
00:41:23.235 - 00:42:09.019, Speaker C: And the temptation is to, to create, you know, a sense of premiumness by going out with a premium price. This is a premium team at a premium price. And the, that works for some people in some contexts, but a lot of the time that can get you in a situation where the, the investors on the other side get sticker shock and then they go, that's, you know, that's way too high and way too much money for me. Thank you. But I'm out. And then if you're not able to get that from the market, it really hurts to then come back to the market with a lower raise and a lower valuation. That is terrible.
00:42:09.019 - 00:42:27.815, Speaker C: You do not want to feel that at all. And more often than not, that'll compromise your entire raise. It's, you know, your damage goods at that point, because the perception that's created is that you couldn't get the amount, the amount of money that you said you needed at the valuation that you needed. And so I see a little bubble.
00:42:28.715 - 00:42:30.763, Speaker B: The AI agree with you, Joel.
00:42:30.939 - 00:43:18.819, Speaker C: The AI agrees with me. And so you don't want, or at least we would advise you to avoid that kind of situation. Instead, it's much better to come out with a reasonable amount of money to raise at a reasonable price. And you know what that number is depends a lot on your circumstances. But it's better to be walked up by the market than it is to be talked down by it. And so, for example, just to illustrate it, let's say that you said, well, I want to raise $10 million at $100 million valuation just to say something. And then you go, well, you know, maybe where are you coming up with those numbers? Well, I make them up based on, you know, what so and so did and raised.
00:43:18.819 - 00:44:21.033, Speaker C: But if, if you, if you actually sit down and think about how much money you need to get to a goal in a period of time as opposed to just trying to match what other teams are racing and you say, well, you know, it turns out that I can get to, you know, this important goal or milestone with a $5 million race. And you know, this is maybe our first round. And so it's totally fine to do that at say a 30 to $50 million valuation. That's going to be a lot more engaging in the conversations early on and it reduces the risk that someone is going to write you off at the first conversation because you came out with a number that's way above the expectations of the market. And then as you run a process and you talk to more people and you get more people interested and on board, then it is much easier for you to increase the number as a function of demand than it is to then have to cut it down and contract it. And so it's better to start low medium and then grow with the demand of the market than otherwise.
00:44:21.169 - 00:45:21.427, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a type of conversation I have with often very engineering led companies that maybe they have one or two founders who's engineer and they don't really have a business founder in the mix. And everything you just said, while makes perfect sense and is accurate is the kind of stuff that makes them want to quit and rip their hair out and say screw it, I'm just going to launch an IEO or something like that. Because they view like look, I'm just trying to build a thing. Like there's all this song and dance you have to do for investors and expectation setting and it all sort of to them, you know, who are engineers that want to build feels, feels very much like theater or sort of lip service or bending the knee or something along the those lines. And there are quite frankly a lot of predatory VCs in the space. There's a lot of very helpful VCs in the space too, but there's a lot of funds that aren't really interested in the long term vision. They're just trying to talk an entrepreneur down to get in at the lowest check they can.
00:45:21.427 - 00:45:41.325, Speaker A: So how do you think that founders should go about figuring out if this VC is actually the right firm for me or not, assuming that they have options and how to raise capital. And how would you sort of, how have you coached founders through some of those, you know, the type of founder who says I don't, you know, I don't really care for all this, I just want to raise money and get back to building.
00:45:41.985 - 00:46:53.959, Speaker C: Yeah, well, the basic piece of advice is get a business partner. If you want to start a business and you want to run a business, it's like you need a business partner and there's plenty like there's no shortage of you look at the, the great technology businesses. It, it's no surprise that they, they come in those configurations. A great technical founder and a person with a great business marketing sense that is able to then turn that technology and that vision into something that's digestible by the market. And that's not important only for raising money and managing that process. It's also for how you then distribute the value of the product that you've built. This is something that we have become increasingly sensitive to over the years where I would say in our first year we were more ideological and then we started to see as we made more and more investments that we, we now look for the business person that's sharp and straight edged and you know, answers emails on time and you know, delivers the investor communications on time and it's totally normal and understandable that to an engineer that feels like song and dance and that's fine.
00:46:53.959 - 00:47:48.803, Speaker C: A lot of it is song and dance and you don't have to do it if you're not good at it, but partner with someone who is. Because if you want to be able to continue to raise money and manage more stakeholders and grow the project, you're going to need to do those things more broadly. When it comes to selecting investors, if you're in a better position is run reference checks, you can look at their websites, look at the teams that they've invested in, see if there's anyone that you can get to and ask them questions. Hey, I heard, saw that you work with so and so they'll give you feedback. Some of it will be positive, hopefully some of it you know, some entrepreneurs might have bad and bad experiences with certain investors. It's not always black and white, and that's totally fine. But ask other entrepreneurs that have worked with those investors that you feel might be similar to your stage or to your market, and you can ask them specifically, you know, how did.
00:47:48.803 - 00:48:27.665, Speaker C: How did they help you? How did they not help you? Sometimes a good investor is one that doesn't bother you too much. Sometimes a good investor is one that, you know, really helps you design something important. That'll all depend on the needs of the individual company. But when you're evaluating multiple investors, or more importantly, when you're putting together a group of investors, then you want to make sure that you have a good expectation for what each one of them is good at. There are things that we're good at. There are things that we're not good at, similarly for all the investors. And so taking stock of the things that you need and then making sure that you select partners that are good at those things is really important.
00:48:28.245 - 00:48:29.825, Speaker A: Chris, you got anything to add?
00:48:31.485 - 00:49:22.331, Speaker B: I guess a few things, but it's really just summarizing parts of what Joel said. The thing we always tell entrepreneurs in our portfolio is to go to market with a number you want to raise, which Joel was saying, and work on the price with the lead. Like crypto has developed this weird norm due to bull markets that an entrepreneur would go to market with a price in mind. Whereas the standard is if you work on the price with the lead, the lead then helps you build the rest of the syndicate. A really good lead will pull together a syndicate because people will want to work with that lead investor. And then it's not solely on the entrepreneur to defend the price, because the lead set the price through a term sheet, really, that they gave to the entrepreneur. And then the lead is a professional investor that can say, this is why I thought this price was suitable in the context of the market.
00:49:22.331 - 00:50:10.889, Speaker B: So I would go so far, and I know Joel would agree from a lot of our conversations of just like, go to market with the amount you want to raise. And the rest is a dynamic conversation with investors. The other thing I was going to say is, like, a lot of entrepreneurs look at the really flashy rounds as a sign of success, but I would say they're as much a counter signal as they are a sign of success. If you raise, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars, you're. You're basically living. The analogy I like to use is you're living in, you know, one of the biggest houses in an expensive neighborhood. And so, you know, any window installations, doorknob replacements, plumbing issues, electrical issues, that's all going to cost you 2 to 3x more than it should.
00:50:10.889 - 00:51:07.163, Speaker B: And people are going to be looking at your house and they're going to be like, I know you have the money, you know, and so then even perverting the hiring process and bloating the team size and all these things, I would say raising gobs of money creates probably more issues than it solves. And so that's another thing to keep in mind. And it's also, if a valuation to raise a lot of money, you have to have a very high valuation, which then means if you go to the market, you typically list at a very high valuation. And I do want to turn to that part of the process. And maybe you're going to take us there, Austin. But, you know, when teams are going into public market listing, we encourage them to, you know, go to market to offer the public the same valuation as the last private round. And that's only a good entry if you've been disciplined and basically raised the minimum amount of money you needed to get to that place and stayed reasonable.
00:51:07.163 - 00:52:10.287, Speaker B: And then the public can often get a great entry. And so I think, keeping that in mind, I also, I have a little rant because there's so much, you know, vilification of VCs on crypto Twitter, some of which is merited, some of which is misplaced. And of course, I'm going to say that as vc, but, you know, the current trope is that, you know, VCs are responsible for all these elevated valuations, the high FTVs in the public market. I think VCs are partially responsible for the, really for the teams that raise a lot of money at high valuations in the private market. But I think people need to spend more time worrying about market makers and exchanges and a lot of what happens there because VCs can't sell for the first year. So anyone who's saying, oh, this thing listed so high and now VCs are selling. The one place where VCs can sell is if they stake the asset, they can sell the interest.
00:52:10.287 - 00:52:41.197, Speaker B: And I think that should change too. I think that, like, staking income off of locked tokens should be subject to the same lockup as the originating token. So that would remove a VC's ability to sell for the first year. And then there's, you know, a vesting schedule from there. But often the ones that have more flexibility in being able to sell in the first year Are market makers or exchanges. And exchanges, some of them extract a greater ownership percentage than VCs to get on those exchanges.
00:52:41.301 - 00:52:41.809, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:41.917 - 00:53:11.747, Speaker B: And you know, and then people are like, well, I need this exchange's support and so I have to do this. And so I think as an industry we do need to solve this issue and it starts with better understanding the problem. And so we do encourage our teams to be very careful with the market maker contracts and very careful with the exchange negotiations. Because that is just as much part of the problem with these high FDVs from day one as VCs are.
00:53:11.891 - 00:53:28.415, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree. I think it's just for fear that those things are not more widely talked about in the industry if you get people in private. Every founder with a token is complaining about exchange bias and they're complaining about market makers charging them huge fees.
00:53:28.835 - 00:53:45.249, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you just remember that it's really not in a VC's if you're a long term VC. For example, just speaking for placeholder here, we prefer our teams to list at low. At as low a price as possible.
00:53:45.377 - 00:53:46.085, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:46.545 - 00:53:54.897, Speaker B: And we don't want a really high day one FDV and then something to bleed out 80, 90, 95% its first year.
00:53:55.001 - 00:53:55.649, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:55.817 - 00:54:16.545, Speaker B: Just from the perspective of building out the community and the network and the fundamentals. But even from an economic perspective, we don't want that because we then have a really high mark the first quarter that the thing's public. It's not like we're taking any liquidity in the first year and then the thing's down 90%. So I think people need to understand it's not even in our economic interest.
00:54:17.725 - 00:54:18.237, Speaker A: Yep.
00:54:18.301 - 00:54:21.225, Speaker B: And then the question is, whose economic interest is it in?
00:54:21.525 - 00:54:57.993, Speaker A: So I want to go off a little bit from what you're talking about, about trying to be conscious of what you're raising at because it informs what you're. You're listing at. One of the major issues with anyone trying to launch a token now is you basically have two options. You can run afoul of potentially a lot of rules and regulations and find ways to sell directly to retail at fairly lower prices. Or you can sort of get lucky like what Solana did. And it was largely undiscovered until the network was already live. No one really had much conviction about it in the early days.
00:54:57.993 - 00:55:44.461, Speaker A: And so retail was able to buy in at very low prices. Solana was under $2 for I think the first year of its existence, which at the time may have seemed expensive, but compared to what's happened since then was quite an attractive entry point. That hasn't really happened on a lot of the new networks, in part because you were saying they raised so much. But even folks who have gone out and said, hey, we're going to really try and not raise a ton, we're going to try and launch a token. Other forces in the market have driven that up extensively. It's hard to talk about specific examples, but you look at Jito or Jupiter, those were both examples of tokens that had not tried to raise a ton. And when they listed, the public market response had just pushed those things up quite high.
00:55:44.461 - 00:56:20.195, Speaker A: So how do you think about founders who try or how do you advise founders when they're trying to manage this stuff correctly? But, you know, either because it's a really hot part of the market cycle or whatever it is, there's sort of, you know, excitement can push a token beyond where the founders feel like it's valued at, and that can become its own expectation problems. Even if that wasn't created through the VC perspective, how folks manage that successfully, I mean, I go back to Elon Musk very famously saying he thought Tesla stock was overvalued at one point. How do founders communicate that sort of thing?
00:56:21.935 - 00:57:10.829, Speaker C: That's a really interesting question, Austin. And part of the reason it's so interesting is because I don't think there's. We'd have an answer for that yet as an industry, because once the token's out and trading, you can't control the price, or at least it's very difficult for you to control the price. And to a large degree, the cases where it has gone well have been a consequence of the right conditions as opposed to the right decisions, in that it wasn't a process that was managed in a particular way. It happened to be, you know, that the conditions of the market at that time were conducive for that outcome. We did some work internally a couple of months ago on trying to correlate. We were.
00:57:10.829 - 00:57:58.985, Speaker C: Were trying to see if the timing of the launch from a market cycle perspective had any influence on valuations. We were trying to see if there was a correlation on launch prices, whether you were launching in a bull market or launching on a bear. There's not really. We started with that assumption. Our head of research, Mario, did the work and we had that assumption because we were thinking about what kind of advice to give entrepreneurs in this context about, okay, is it better to launch in a bull or is it better to launch in a bear? And so Mario went and pulled a bunch of data and found that there, there was no, no real strong correlation in these outcomes whether you were launching the bullet bear. There might be other things that influenced them. We didn't, we didn't go another layer deeper.
00:57:58.985 - 00:59:11.369, Speaker C: We were just kind of surprised by the outcome and then realized, okay, instead of advising entrepreneurs, well, it might be better to launch, because we wanted to make the argument that it was better to launch in a bear market than to launch in a bull market. With the assumption being that if you launch in a bear market, then the market is more organized and less sort of volatile towards the upside. And maybe it saves you from some of these predicaments. But there really doesn't seem to be a relationship between when you launch and then the valuation that you get. The valuation that you get is the one that you get, and it depends on the product, the service, you know, what kinds of customers are you targeting? You know, for example, projects that are more infrastructure and developer oriented are going to attract a different set of eyeballs than projects that, you know, take off with consumers and become really popular. And so it doesn't seem like the timing of the market has a big influence on it. And then in terms of, like, managing that yourself, you know, there's the things that Chris mentioned which are absolutely right.
00:59:11.369 - 01:00:33.055, Speaker C: You know, what kinds of deals you get into with exchanges and market makers. But it's a really tricky environment for an entrepreneur because if you don't do those deals or if you don't play that game, then you have a different problem, which is that you may get passed over by the market and capital allocators. And so just as it is really painful to list at a high price and then see the thing go down 90%, there's also a lot of cases where you list low and you're on the fourth page of CoinMarketCap and no one sees you and, you know, the capital doesn't really accrue. You don't get to build liquidity and trading volumes. You don't get listed on exchanges. Because there's this other thing that I think is important to point out, which is part of the problem is before launch, you're thinking, okay, I need exchanges, I need custodians, and I need all of this market infrastructure so that there can be liquidity for the token, so that it can be useful for the network. Because a lot of what goes into the utility of the network has to do with the value and the liquidity of the token, right? Because people need to be able to buy it at scale to be able to use it at scale before you launch.
01:00:33.055 - 01:00:56.893, Speaker C: Exchanges, custodians, et cetera, they don't want to, they, they don't want to spend a lot of resources listing a $30 million market cap asset because they're not going to make a lot of money doing that. The custodians charge make money based on assets under custody.
01:00:57.029 - 01:00:57.557, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:57.661 - 01:01:58.235, Speaker C: And then the exchanges make money on trading volumes, which are correlated to a large degree to market cap. And so naturally the market infrastructure players are going to prioritize the names that they expect will have high valuations, high trading volumes, and so on and so forth. And so that creates the circumstances where the market incentive is to have market makers to provide a lot of trading volume, which then those market makers want high valuations. And then the exchanges and the custodians want the high valuations because that's directly tied to their business model. And so that all contributes to this problem. Because then if you decide to take the high road and say, well, I'm going to launch at a low valuation, then what you find is that then exchanges don't want to list you, custodians don't want to list you either until you get to those valuations. But it might be harder to do that after launch.
01:01:58.615 - 01:03:05.399, Speaker B: Yeah. Especially from the institutional perspective because I think everything Joel was just referencing was on the centralized exchange and centralized custodian side, which is absolutely correct. And it is true that there's a type of momentum with centralized exchanges where if you don't get at least one tier 1 centralized exchange off of launch, it develops a negative momentum and it's hard to add any in the future because also centralized exchanges are, you know, they're subject to FOMO like anyone else's. And so you can build up excitement pre launch more easily than you can say, okay, hey, we don't, you know, we only trade $100,000 a day, but we're going to have these upgrades to the network that we think would be really important. So we'd like you to support you once you're already liquid, it's a harder case to make to a centralized exchange. You know, this is me just riffing in real time. But like it does feel like one of the solutions is more going back to more Dex based issuance, but this is more retail focused, right? Yeah, Dex based issuance, initial Dex offerings, things.
01:03:05.399 - 01:03:58.647, Speaker B: But, but Dexes and idos that are more curated, higher quality. Right. We've all seen how the majority of pumped out fund users lose money. And so what are higher signal ways to curate these launches to get those offerings to the public. Also, what's the way in which the information is distributed? Can we have a funnel where you have the single A's, A AA's, AAA's, of liquidity up to the major leagues of the centralized exchanges? And can you build up in that process? And I'd like to think that that feeds into a resurgence of ICOS or some type of more public funding mechanism where you can go through that process. If you have significant DEX volumes, can you then get on a centralized exchange? I know what the centralized exchanges are going to say because we've already had some of these conversations. They'll say, well, this thing is already Dex dominated.
01:03:58.647 - 01:04:13.107, Speaker B: Right. And so how are we going to break in? And so it is a sticky problem. And I think the important thing for the public to realize is a lot of us are working through in real time of how to solve this problem and we recognize it as a problem.
01:04:13.291 - 01:05:01.121, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting that you talk about direct DEX listings and ieos and those sorts of things because like in the traditional equities space, the idea of a company went through a crowdfunding model is a pretty negative mark. Right. The average quality of something that goes through crowdfunding versus, and I say this as someone who used to work for Republic. Right. But the average quality of something that goes through that is much lower. And for many investors, like there was sort of this, like, you know, this, this, this joke for a lot of people who are investing in stuff on Republic and other crowdfunding platforms, which is like, you should only invest in women and minority founders through crowdfunding platforms because any other company, they should have had the social access to raise from a better location. Right.
01:05:01.121 - 01:05:16.125, Speaker A: And there's sort of this bias around like DEX listings too, where like, I don't. Have you guys ever invested in a project through one of those types of offerings as opposed to just buying it on either public markets or in doing it in private?
01:05:17.105 - 01:05:17.713, Speaker C: We have.
01:05:17.769 - 01:05:21.565, Speaker A: What would the barriers be for you as a fund even being able to do something like that?
01:05:21.865 - 01:06:27.645, Speaker C: Yeah, we, we have experimented with that. It hasn't been very successful, which doesn't help solve the problem, or at least it doesn't create a counterexample. That's encouraging. It is more challenging from an institutional perspective because it's much better to work with a counterparty where you can follow KYC due diligence rules, laws. And so it's not so much that there is in most cases a clear prohibition, as much as it's Sort of like, you know, it is better when you are a regulated financial investor to walk through the path that is well lit, as opposed to through the back alley, even if there's nothing wrong or illegal about the back alley. And it usually also is more complex to, for example, get the right exposure to the investments that you want to make. Or, for example, it might not be possible to get the investment sizes that make sense for funds of certain sizes.
01:06:27.645 - 01:07:35.135, Speaker C: But to a large degree, that's part of the. You know, you can see that as a, as a feature, not a bug. Because if some of these mechanisms are meant to advantage the smaller individual investor over the larger institutional investor, then by that standard, then those are working as intended because they're creating barriers of entry on different, on different sides of the table. And so that is one thing that we can think about. I mean, we can segment the capital pools very roughly in centralized liquidity venues, which would be the centralized exchanges and OTC desks, decentralized liquidity venues, which would be on chain and then private markets. And for the most part, the easiest place for professional institutional investors to participate is in the private markets, followed by the centralized liquidity venues, followed by the decentralized liquidity venues. In terms of hierarchy, what I would suggest as a thought exercise is there's not one path.
01:07:35.135 - 01:08:13.945, Speaker C: It's more of how do you put together a capital structure that is well balanced between those three pools of capital? And so it's not, I'm only going to raise publicly. Sorry, I'm only going to raise on private markets. And then, you know, the hell with everything else. It's. Well, you know, can you think about how you make use of the resources that you have to basically think of these as distribution mechanisms for capital, and how much do you allocate to each pool and how do you find a balance between the three poles as opposed to going extremely on one side or another?
01:08:14.395 - 01:08:35.335, Speaker A: All right, well, before we wrap today, are there any resources you would direct people to, to learn more about this? First, how can people get in touch with you if they're interested in following up and getting in touch with Placeholder? And then, you know, for entrepreneurs who are looking to raise, who are thinking about starting this process, what are some resources you'd suggest they start with?
01:08:36.595 - 01:09:15.775, Speaker B: Well, we're both available on Twitter. Joel is much more elusive than I am. Um, but I'm on Twitter @cbrnisky and Joel's on Twitter @monegro. Um, and placeholder VC is also there. Um, I will say, you know, somewhat by Design Placeholder is not the flashiest venture firm. And we operate more like a rifle. And there are certain times where we're extremely active and other times where we, you know, let things mature and mostly focus on the existing portfolios.
01:09:15.775 - 01:10:49.337, Speaker B: And so, you know, if you don't hear back from us, don't take it personally. I think would be, you know, something I would say, because, you know, each, each firm has its own mandates and styles and just depending on, we're pretty sensitive to market conditions in the way in which we act, you know, in terms of a entrepreneur's path, when I think about my own path, I think meetups were the single most important thing to me early on in New York City and for such a digitally dominated industry. I do think that meeting people in real life, especially in smaller venues, is a key part of this and learning the inside game through really honest conversation. And I don't mean the inside game through anything nefarious, but more, a lot of what gets put on social media or written about more publicly, it's always a little more sugar coated and the details and being able to pull on threads and those types of conversations typically happen in groups of four or less. And so finding those settings. And I know that the bitcoin Meetup scene in 2014 in New York City is very different from what it's like in 2024. The Ethereum meetup scene in 2015 and 16 is different from what it is now.
01:10:49.337 - 01:11:13.813, Speaker B: And I know it's gotten bigger, but still looking for those venues where you can get small, intimate, long duration conversations is key. You know, our. Our youngest research analyst, Gurnor, is hosting research groups in New York City as an example of this. And some of the best things I ever attended, actually. Joel at USV used to host White Paper Wednesdays.
01:11:13.949 - 01:11:17.021, Speaker A: I think I do remember those.
01:11:17.213 - 01:12:08.875, Speaker B: Yeah. And like, those were awesome because they'd be relatively small groups of very nerdy, high signal people. And so the more you can dig into the nerdier, more substantial groups, I think the better. Now in order to actually get value out of those settings, you have to be in it for the tech or in it for the nerdiness or the substance. And so then mixers or like networking events or those types of things, those are more for people who are in it, you know, for the drinks or the networking or the whatever. And so you gotta be really conscious, I think with the size of the industry now and especially some of the glitz about, okay, what is this event being constructed for? Because it's kind of like people tell you. If someone tells you who they are, believe them.
01:12:08.875 - 01:12:16.731, Speaker B: If a net. If an event tells you what it's for, believe it. You know, And a white paper event is different from a cocktail mixer.
01:12:16.923 - 01:12:23.455, Speaker A: All right, well, Chris, Joel, thank you for joining us today on Validated. Really appreciate your time.
01:12:24.035 - 01:12:27.295, Speaker B: It was an awesome conversation. So thank you, Austin, and thank you, Joel.
01:12:27.755 - 01:12:29.275, Speaker C: Thank you, Austin. You, too, Chris.
