00:00:00.560 - 00:00:02.526, Speaker A: If we can't talk to each other, we're not gonna make it.
00:00:02.630 - 00:00:10.142, Speaker B: Sometimes I feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. Most of the time, I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.
00:00:10.278 - 00:00:14.758, Speaker A: A face full of glass hurts like hell when you're in it. That's weird. That glass looks half full to me.
00:00:14.806 - 00:00:17.158, Speaker B: Eating glass. Eating glass is staring at the abyss.
00:00:17.286 - 00:00:21.514, Speaker A: Glass. Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this?
00:00:22.894 - 00:00:25.994, Speaker B: It's kind of part of our culture to eat glass.
00:00:27.014 - 00:00:29.394, Speaker A: Gotta get some safety goggles next time.
00:00:39.174 - 00:01:18.290, Speaker B: Hey, everybody, and welcome to Chewing glass, the show where we talk to developers building in the Solana ecosystem. Today I'm joined by quite the Og Solana engineer, Siong of mercurial Meteora and Jupiter. And all these things are essentially under the same umbrella. But, like, Siong and I have sort of, we've never met, but we've engaged, um, over the course of the last few years. Uh, he helped out with some developer experience stuff, wrote some things. We never met, but, like, it's awesome to have him here because he's been building a lot of crazy stuff over the last few years. So, anyway, siang, like, great to have you on, man.
00:01:18.442 - 00:01:19.002, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:19.058 - 00:01:46.352, Speaker B: Yeah, well, um, I'll just, we'll save this for later, but I'm going to say straight off the bat, congratulations on the Jupiter launch. That was like, I'm sure that you guys were all stressed to the max. Um, everything went smoothly. You did not take down our network. Um, so that's, uh, that's a pretty big feat. Um, and pretty exciting stuff. So, um, anyways, the way we like to kick the show off is, is really to just, like, start from day one.
00:01:46.352 - 00:02:04.274, Speaker B: Um, and, like, that's like your sort of developer journey arc throughout the beginning. And, like, and I'm talking, like, prior to crypto. So to start, like, are you, are you sort of a formally trained engineer? Do you get started in college, like, self taught? Like, what's your, what's your, what's your origin story?
00:02:05.054 - 00:02:30.408, Speaker A: So I grew up in Malaysia that I actually went to school in some way in Chicago. I went to school at University of Illinois, champaign, spent, you know, like, four years in college, computer science, you know, engineering background. Then after that, like, after school, me spending the early years of my career on, like, different startups, you know?
00:02:30.496 - 00:02:44.204, Speaker B: So, yeah, so real quick, like, when you were in college, you just took in the traditional courses. Any specialties? Basically just like the normal. Like, probably did some java, some c sharp, like, whatever they were teaching us in those days at university.
00:02:44.544 - 00:03:04.414, Speaker A: So I was pretty lucky back then because I went to school during the time, like, 2008 to 2012. The bitcoin white paper came out around, like, 2009. So, like, you know, computer science, like, pretty big computer science school. A lot of people were talking about it. You know, it's like, bitcoin white paper. It's very cool. You can do a lot of stuff.
00:03:04.414 - 00:03:08.670, Speaker A: So I spent a lot of time in, like, distributor system, you know, all these things.
00:03:08.782 - 00:03:17.634, Speaker B: Cool. So then after you graduated college, like, you. So what was your sort of first career experiences?
00:03:17.994 - 00:03:31.122, Speaker A: So I was pretty like, I was pretty, like, I was trying to start, like, companies and stuff. So during my freshman year in college, I actually joined this incubator called Y Combinator. I'm not sure you guys are aware of it.
00:03:31.138 - 00:03:32.574, Speaker B: I think I've heard about it.
00:03:33.754 - 00:03:54.590, Speaker A: So it was like a program, like Hacker News and all this thing that was really early on. So I did that my freshman year. I was lucky enough the company got acquired right after, like, we launched. Yeah, I was working for, like, actually pretty funny right now. Like, Seth Altman, the CEO of, like, OpenAI, was my boss for, like, six months.
00:03:54.702 - 00:04:07.486, Speaker B: Really? So what was. What was your, what was your. So you went to y combinator with a startup that eventually got acquired pretty quickly. What was the. What were you. Were you the end? Like, were you an engineer? Were you just a founder? Were you a tech found? You did.
00:04:07.510 - 00:04:10.270, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:04:10.422 - 00:04:14.670, Speaker B: So what did you build and what was acquired? Are we allowed to talk about that?
00:04:14.862 - 00:04:22.974, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we built. I'm not sure people still remember foursquare. You know, you can check it at places and stuff like that.
00:04:23.014 - 00:04:34.158, Speaker B: I've made some joke tweets about, like, when are we gonna see foursquare on chain? Like, a couple years ago. And, like, it's like, you know, I totally remember foursquare. I remember where you could be the. The governor of McDonald's or whatever the things.
00:04:34.206 - 00:04:46.200, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So that's exactly what I view. So I think four square launched around, like, uh, April or May, then we launched, like, a month or two months later. Yeah.
00:04:46.352 - 00:04:47.640, Speaker B: Okay. What was the process?
00:04:47.672 - 00:04:52.456, Speaker A: Obviously, I won't remember foursquare, and we got acquired. No one remembers. Yeah.
00:04:52.560 - 00:04:59.888, Speaker B: Wait, so are you saying that your Y combinator project was acquired and turned into Foursquare, or you built a similar thing?
00:04:59.936 - 00:05:02.944, Speaker A: No, no. So I built a similar thing. Okay.
00:05:03.064 - 00:05:06.920, Speaker B: And what was the. What was the tech stack in that, um, back then?
00:05:06.952 - 00:05:19.444, Speaker A: It's actually very funny. Um, so that. That was right after iPhone just came out. Right. So, like, the whole development thing on iPhone is totally new. Eword. Now remember eword.
00:05:19.444 - 00:05:42.116, Speaker A: Simple things like reading and reading and passing JSon is very difficult. Yeah. So you have to write your own custom parser and all these things. It took us a while, but, you know, like, it's actually pretty fun. Like, we have to do objective C. And that is another funny thing is that we also have to use Java as well to build it. To build.
00:05:42.116 - 00:05:44.024, Speaker A: I'm not sure you remember BlackBerry.
00:05:45.044 - 00:05:49.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm old too. I'm old too. I know, I see.
00:05:49.972 - 00:05:59.260, Speaker A: So everyone has to build like, you know, like we all, we had, we had to build an app for the BlackBerry so people can start checking in, you know, from the BlackBerry. Yeah.
00:05:59.372 - 00:06:33.010, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, I mean, like, Bill having to build Jerome Parser and all that stuff. Like a lot of those times, like, I've, I had, um, I had, I've had other people on and like, the ones that have to like, deal with that stuff early on in their careers and like, solve problems where you don't have all these crazy abstractions. You have to like, hand roll your own shit that teaches you a lot and then that makes the rest of your career easier when you start using all these tools. So, like, I mean, I think at the time it probably sucked, but maybe was some fun, but like, it benefits you down the road always. So, yeah.
00:06:33.042 - 00:06:42.978, Speaker A: One thing I think I find very interesting is that, you know, like, now people build stuff, right? They don't have to think about the concern of memory, you know, all these things. Back then, it's different.
00:06:43.066 - 00:06:44.294, Speaker B: I do own Solana.
00:06:47.434 - 00:07:04.754, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So now it's actually very similar duty of Solana as well. You start having constraints like, you know, memory stack, like heap memory, all this stuff. But back then, iPhone is the same as all, if I remember correct, was like 40 megabyte per app or something like that. So you have to manage the memory like pretty religiously.
00:07:04.914 - 00:07:32.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that, that just sort of teaches you, like, you know, like now it's just like, whatever, we'll just use this thing that uses up all of our memory and like, we don't, we don't really give a shit. But then, like, when you're, then when you, like, get to the place where you have to, you don't have, you don't even know where to begin, so that's cool. So, so after your startup got acquired, what was the where, where did you head after that? Did you head to some more startups or did you, um, what'd you do?
00:07:33.144 - 00:07:38.760, Speaker A: Yeah, so basically the same thing. Um, I actually never worked for anyone in my life.
00:07:38.832 - 00:07:40.544, Speaker B: Lucky you. So lucky you.
00:07:40.624 - 00:08:05.316, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mean now like, you know, like I always have to work for the company, so that's like one thing, but you know. Yeah. After, after the company got acquired, I actually went back to college. I couldn't get my visa. I was still, I know I was still an international student. So finish up my college came, came, you know, came back out into the Bay Area, San Francisco. I was in San Francisco for about six years between different startup as well.
00:08:05.316 - 00:08:06.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:06.324 - 00:08:16.944, Speaker B: Okay. And was there any, like. So what, what sort of stuff were you doing? Like, like on the tech side were like, what technologies were you working with? Like after, like in those different jobs you were jumping around on?
00:08:17.564 - 00:08:38.176, Speaker A: Yeah. So, um, so during the six years time in, uh, in, uh, in, in SF, I like, I helped started two companies. So one was this thing called Envoy. I'm not sure you guys know about it. It's like an iPad app. As company front desk. Before you enter the company, you're putting your information and whatnot.
00:08:38.240 - 00:08:42.560, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's like a sign in thing just to like. So they can track who's going in and out.
00:08:42.592 - 00:08:42.776, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:42.800 - 00:08:49.084, Speaker B: I don't know if I know the specific one, but I'm familiar with those types of softwares. My, one of my old companies used to use that. I hated it.
00:08:51.744 - 00:08:57.672, Speaker A: But you know, it's pretty helpful for people who are visiting, like, you know, other people in the company.
00:08:57.768 - 00:08:58.440, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:08:58.472 - 00:09:22.502, Speaker A: So I, so my roommate started that, so I was helping him to grow the company. It was like at one point just two of us. I think now the company is like 3400 people. You know, they raised multiple rounds after that. I was there for the sit round then. Seriously, I think now they just, I think they just closed their like 200 million something we see last year.
00:09:22.558 - 00:09:30.038, Speaker B: Oh, wow. So, but you were, you were, you were like, you're an engineer at heart. So you, were you engineering? Were you doing engineering for the projects?
00:09:30.126 - 00:09:31.862, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I always been doing engineering.
00:09:31.878 - 00:09:48.524, Speaker B: Yeah. So what's, what, what tech stack were you using? Like, I'm just curious, like on your tech stack over the course of your career. So you did. We're doing an objective c and stuff and then some java. So like what, like what other sort of language? Like this sort of leading up to the, to where you are now. But like what, what were you were what experience were you getting?
00:09:49.304 - 00:09:52.448, Speaker A: I spent most of my time in Ruby. Ruby Andreas.
00:09:52.536 - 00:09:54.584, Speaker B: Oh, okay, interesting.
00:09:54.624 - 00:10:00.448, Speaker A: I used to be in the top hundred contributor, open source contributor list or something like that. Yeah.
00:10:00.536 - 00:10:09.444, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, that's. That's impressive. Yeah. I've had a couple people that talk about, like, Rubio. There's some people that really still love it a lot, to be honest.
00:10:11.054 - 00:10:24.790, Speaker A: It's one of those things, right. You know, like, you can compare it pretty similar to, like, Solana engineering. Right? Like, people who love it just, like, fucking love it. Right? People who, like candidates, like, would never do it. Yeah. Ruby is the same as. All right.
00:10:24.790 - 00:10:36.766, Speaker A: You know, it's like you have DSH 37 signal basecamp talking about it all the time. Then you have, like, a core group of, like, people who just love it. Like, you know, like, I just want to do it for the rest of my life. Right. Yeah.
00:10:36.870 - 00:11:14.422, Speaker B: So not only are you a gigabrain engineer, you've spent a lot of your career in Ruby on rails. You've got acquired multiple companies. That's. I was honestly just, like, from somebody like you who, like, I know is, like, a rust engineer and anchor and building, like, defies stuff. It's kind of shocking to hear your sort of, like, really early origin story as, like, like, a startup founder never working for a company and spending a lot of your career building on Ruby on rails. So that's awesome. So how about this? So I kind of get the picture of your story.
00:11:14.422 - 00:11:39.046, Speaker B: I'm sort of jealous and impressed at the same time. But what was your. So you mentioned earlier about hearing about bitcoin. Like, when did you first find out about bitcoin and crypto, and what did you think about it when you heard? Were you like, there's. There's two reactions. One is like, this is. People with a lot of foresight are like, wow, this could be big, and I'm gonna get rich.
00:11:39.046 - 00:11:54.794, Speaker B: And other people are like, this tech is really cool. Or then there's actually. There's three things. And the third is, like, this is stupid. And, like, what the hell are these people doing? So where. What camp did you fall into? Like, when you first heard about bitcoin?
00:11:55.214 - 00:12:33.302, Speaker A: Definitely the number two camp. So, you know, as a freshman, like, in college, like, caring about bitcoin is, like, definitely very exciting. Right? You know, like, when you're in school, you're learning about all this concept, you know, like, distributor system, like, how you can scale, like, a network and stuff like that, then security and whatnot. A lot of it, you know, just theory. Right? You have no idea what kind of real life applications that you can do or use with the things that you learn. Then you saw, like, when. When I saw the bitcoin paper coming, I was like, wow, like, actually uses a lot of things I was just learning in school, in real life, right.
00:12:33.302 - 00:12:48.868, Speaker A: I said, wow, like, you can actually secure this whole, like, Internet money with, like, all the things I was learning. Like, yeah, it was definitely very cool. I started, like, I remember I started, like, mining with my laptop. I could still. It was. It could still work. Yeah, back then.
00:12:49.006 - 00:13:05.248, Speaker B: So. So kind of, like, for you, the timing was you were already sort of, like, interested in doing those things. And then bitcoin whitepaper came out. So it was like, right place, right time. Like, like, hey, I'm already thinking about these things. And now somebody just created this thing. That's pretty awesome.
00:13:05.248 - 00:13:30.404, Speaker B: Was there, like. So you said you mined it, but, like, did you have any other, like, well, leading up to whenever you first, like, the story before, like, getting into, like, building on blockchain or anything like that? Like, did you just watch bitcoin for a while? Did you mine it? Did you actually, like, get involved in any sort of, like, bitcoin development or, like, ethereum development or anything else, like, along those in that timeframe?
00:13:30.744 - 00:13:52.910, Speaker A: So. So, you know, the only disappointing thing about bitcoins, like, people say there's, like, Internet money. You can build all these things on it. But any engineer would know, like, if you start trying to build things on bitcoins, like, no, you cannot do shit with it. Like, you know, the only thing you can do is, like, you mine it, then you keep it. You use it for some things. Like, that's it, right? So, like, I was like, okay, like, after mining it, like, I was.
00:13:52.910 - 00:14:21.646, Speaker A: I was after trying to, like, tell my roommates about it and stuff like that. It's like, um, I stopped for, like, a, you know, life got busy. Like, I start working on these different things and whatnot. Um, and I was like, I stopped doing. I'm like, you know, like, boring about it. Then I think right around the time that Ethereum came out, you know, when I started reading about Ethereum, like, I was like, holy shit. This is something that you can, you know, actually build on, right? You like, the smart contract.
00:14:21.646 - 00:14:55.652, Speaker A: You can easily build like, a simple, like, you know, dice, like a casino, like, on it, like, you know, all these things. I was like, wow, like, this is something really cool. Um, I remember, like, the time was like, what, 2016 or 17? Some time around that. Yeah. So I was. I was, yeah, I was just, like, leaving my last company, like, thinking what to do next, right? That was like, then I decided that, okay, fuck it. Like, I'm going to spend more time on, like, the blockchain development and stuff like that.
00:14:55.652 - 00:15:19.924, Speaker A: So that was also the time that I came back to Malaysia. So I basically left Bay Area for good. I came back to Malaysia right around 2018. From 2018 to 2020. I was like, you know, trying to do a lot of different things to figure out, like, what life is going to be like in Malaysia. You know, I would spend, like, my, my career, like, adult time in Malaysia. Like, you know, after high school, I came straight to our us.
00:15:19.924 - 00:15:29.976, Speaker A: So I was like, okay, um, I was doing a bunch of different things. Contract, um, you know, the Ethereum contract, helping people to launch token and stuff like that.
00:15:30.000 - 00:15:37.312, Speaker B: Yeah, cool. So how was, like, did you enjoy that building smart contracts on Ethereum?
00:15:37.488 - 00:16:00.404, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say it's actually quite tricky in the sense that I don't like the language personally. Like, solidity. Like, it's fun to write, it's very quick to deploy, like something, but a lot, a lot of times you have to worry about a lot of security concerns, how to make sure that it's secure.
00:16:01.304 - 00:16:17.794, Speaker B: Did, at the time when you were doing that was like, did you just because, like, you are where you are now and doing what you're doing, like, at the time when you were building that, did you, like, have any sort of mindset that, like, hey, like, this is probably not going to be able to scale to consumers? Did this pop to your head?
00:16:17.874 - 00:16:32.934, Speaker A: Like, for. That's for sure, right. You know, like, anyone who use Ethereum, they know how slow is. Right? Like, and how expensive it can be. Right, right. I remember, like, back on the day, it was like the first bull run. I mean, the first ether bull run was like 20 818 or something like that.
00:16:32.974 - 00:16:34.794, Speaker B: Like 20 2017.
00:16:36.454 - 00:16:37.190, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:37.342 - 00:17:17.394, Speaker B: I made a lot of money and I lost it all on Ethereum, so. All right, so, so let's talk about the transition. Let's talk about, like, the leap from building on solidity to, like, where you are now. Like, without going too deep into, like, like, your projects that you were involved in. Like, how did you, who plucked you out of Ethereum world and brought you to Solana? Or did you sort of like, do what some of us did, myself included, was just start seeing Anatoly talk about it and thinking like, hey, this thing might actually be legit. Or like, what was the, what was that moment for you? And, like, when was it, was it in, was it in 2020 or 2021?
00:17:18.814 - 00:17:28.006, Speaker A: I think we started 2021. Yeah. So early January 2021, right? Or 2022? Yeah, slightly more than two years ago.
00:17:28.030 - 00:17:42.014, Speaker B: It was definitely 2020 was like, the launch of the network, 2021. Like, was like the really early days. And you were definitely around in 21. I remember because there was only a few of us.
00:17:42.554 - 00:18:05.992, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's been like. So basically, Mel and I had known each other for, like, I met him in 22,009. So Mel and I have known each other for. For quite a long time right now, 2009 until now. So we've been trying to work on things together. We actually, like, work on a couple of things together.
00:18:05.992 - 00:18:27.006, Speaker A: He actually helped me a lot through the college because I was working for him on a part time basis when I was in college. Then we keep in touch since then. We talked about different ideas, and we talked about different things to build. So at the time, he was at Kyber, one of the OG ethereum companies.
00:18:27.110 - 00:18:32.554, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Okay. I'm learning all kinds of shit now. I had no, I did not know that. Yeah, I know Kyber.
00:18:33.214 - 00:18:37.838, Speaker A: He actually built WBTC when it was at Kyber. Yeah.
00:18:37.926 - 00:18:39.634, Speaker B: Oh, wow, cool.
00:18:40.054 - 00:18:51.750, Speaker A: So Mel. Mel and I was like, yo, like, you know, let's. Let's build something together. Then. We are looking at, like, you know, like, ethereum. We are like, okay, this thing is not psychic at all. Like, things are slow and stuff like that.
00:18:51.750 - 00:19:13.550, Speaker A: Obviously, there are other things as well, and mostly EVM based. We are like, okay, let's do something different. For me personally, as an engineer, people talk about rust all the time. I was like, okay, well, Solana seems pretty cool, pretty interesting. I was trying to do some simple things on it, transfer and all this, and everything's instant once you tried.
00:19:13.662 - 00:19:16.914, Speaker B: Did you use the Paul X escrow tutorial to learn anything?
00:19:17.554 - 00:19:22.154, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So Paul was looking with us for. For the early days as well. Yeah.
00:19:22.194 - 00:19:23.354, Speaker B: Nice, nice.
00:19:23.474 - 00:19:32.106, Speaker A: Yeah. So Paul, that con, that blog post, like, basically consolidate, like, everything I need, like, to learn about so many people.
00:19:32.170 - 00:19:59.162, Speaker B: From the early days, they called it. I say this on this podcast a lot, but it's like, they called it the Solana Bible because, like, anybody knew that came in, that was really the only piece of content outside of, like, just looking at the code and looking at the tests or, like, the. The protocol or, like, the SPL library, like that. And it also had some text to it, so it kind of explains some things. So that's pretty cool that you use that as well. It's the gift. Keeps on giving, to be honest.
00:19:59.298 - 00:20:18.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, people, like, I was talking about, like, you know, I have to do my own json passing that was actually pretty similar in the early days of Solana development itself. Right. You have to, like, specify each, like, instruction. You know, zero index calling this thing, one index calling these instructions now with anchor. Like, people don't have to think about this kind of thing. Yeah.
00:20:18.212 - 00:20:19.584, Speaker B: Shout out to Armani.
00:20:20.244 - 00:20:21.364, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:20:21.524 - 00:20:44.334, Speaker B: So, okay, cool. So you, so you were building, you were learning, you used, you kind of doing the thing, chewing the glass, and you guys were just tinkering around, I guess, for a while because, like, now we can see, like, you guys came up with a product. Like, so was, was mercurial your first project, or did you, like, guys try to do some other stuff before that?
00:20:45.154 - 00:21:19.054, Speaker A: So Mercury was always the first project. So we know, we know the network was new. Right. It's very important to have something like, you know, I think Auka was doing something about token swapping. Then we realized that, you know, it's very important to have something that, you know, stable to stable swap, SDC, USDT. Then hopefully more like, we were hoping that they were going to be more stable coins project coming up on Solana. The way we think about it is we feel like the development of Defi will be very similar to Ethereum and Solana.
00:21:19.054 - 00:21:23.734, Speaker A: So we are trying to build whatever is popular Ethereum, trying to do it on Solana.
00:21:23.814 - 00:21:40.394, Speaker B: That makes sense. Solana got a lot of slack for that in the early days, but it's like, what do you expect? You guys built some really great primitives. Of course we're going to build Solana and. Exactly, then we'll, then we'll innovate from there. But, like, you know, like, exactly. Essentially, aetherium, just cough. Copied Wall street primitives.
00:21:40.394 - 00:21:48.554, Speaker B: Like, if we're being honest. And then, and then Solana copied Ethereum and so on and so forth. You know, like, these are primitives of finance, so, like, they're going to happen.
00:21:48.674 - 00:22:14.416, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So basically around the time, you know, like, we were building, like, mercurial, like, you know, and Ian and like Dylan, they all building sabre as well. A pretty strong competitor out there. Everyone remembers sabre. We were like this, the very fast second with mercurial. So it's very hard to compete.
00:22:14.416 - 00:22:41.242, Speaker A: But the one good thing that we build on our UI is we allow people to do serum swap as well. So other than just normal USDT, USDC swap, you can also have a simple swap ui, like interfacing on top serum. So you have all these different tokens that you can swap. Like, that's the only way we can get users to come to our website other than stable swap, you can also come here to do, like, different swap as well, right?
00:22:41.298 - 00:23:00.918, Speaker B: I mean, I think a lot of people, like, essentially they just all leveraged the serum order book, like, within their, like, that was like, that was phase one of every defi app early on was like, integrate with serum and provide all that, like, already existing functionality, and then we'll build our additional products and features around that, so.
00:23:01.006 - 00:23:11.910, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I mean, one thing that's very strong back then was like, all new tokens were always launched on serum because it's very easy to pick up, like, new tokens and stuff like that.
00:23:11.942 - 00:23:41.154, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And then, I don't know, like, radium. Radium was the first time I actually, like, started using, like, a deck. Like, serum was like, honestly, like, my eyes bled every time I looked at it. I think radium was, like, the first, like, sort of, like, very pretty looking, popular, Dex. Like, it still wasn't perfect, but it was like, wow, this is, like, a lot nicer than everything we've been trying to use.
00:23:41.614 - 00:24:02.128, Speaker A: I mean, the speed alone is very, like, it makes everything different. You know anyone who have tried using, like, ethereum? I talked to people who are working on Solana right now. They're complaining, but I was like, yo, have you tried ethereum before? They were like, oh, like, I've never used ethereum. Like, Solana is my first stick. But, like, yo, trial ethereum, then you know why, like, Solana, Solana is very different.
00:24:02.296 - 00:24:22.048, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of people don't really realize, like, Solana ecosystem is not a lot of Ethereum converts. Like, everything from developers to users is. This is their first blockchain that they've been building on. There are a handful of them out there. The guys at the guys at Saber were Ethereum engineers first, I think. Pretty sure Tristan Zeta also did ethereum. There's a.
00:24:22.048 - 00:25:00.370, Speaker B: There's a few of them out there, but, like, a lot of people that are building right now, like, they came in for rust. They came in, they didn't even try on any other blockchain because they were waiting for something that was fast enough to, like, to run use cases, run order books, like flobs and all that stuff on chain. So it's. It was good. Like, I think those early days also helped. Like, the bar was so high for engineering talent that it brought in some of the smartest people out there that were created the base. It created the base of our engineering talent that then, like, helped the next generation of people.
00:25:00.370 - 00:25:21.538, Speaker B: And then it just kept going. You. I remember you offering to help, like, write content or do some things in those early days? Because I just started and I was like, there's nothing. I don't even know where to begin to, like, to support all these demand for engineers. But Solana Cookbook was one of those things that came out that really helped a lot of people. So. But anyways, let's get back to your story.
00:25:21.538 - 00:25:29.854, Speaker B: So you guys, so you guys had, had built that first project and, and then, like, what happened from there?
00:25:30.914 - 00:25:59.934, Speaker A: So, yeah, so like I mentioned earlier, right, it's like we have this, like, serum interface that everyone was using. Like, you know, like you say if you go to serum, looking at all the other book, it's like, for a newcomer, it's very overwhelming. But for someone who just want to swap, right, they would rather come to our website. It's like, oh, like just a simple, soft form. You put in what you want to buy, you know, what you want to buy with, then click a button. Then you, like, you basically skip the whole open book, like, order book ui. Like, just like, get the token that you want.
00:25:59.934 - 00:26:00.554, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:01.094 - 00:26:14.354, Speaker B: We're talking about, like, we're talking about the swap that everybody sees today when they cut, like, even like, on Jupiter. Like, it's that simple. Like, what coin and what other coin? And then you hit a button. Exactly, right, exactly.
00:26:15.114 - 00:26:53.524, Speaker A: So we were like, okay, what can we do more with it? We started thinking about, or maybe we can increase our mercurial volume. We can actually allow people to do routing, easy routing other than just buying back. Then everything is coupled with soul. You have to x token with soul. Then you need to have Sol in order to buy something. So we started doing something simple, like how can we mix and match different tokens as part of the routing? The first version of Jupyter is actually like a very simple one. You can only do simple routing between a few different pools.
00:26:53.524 - 00:27:00.104, Speaker A: And everything's mostly funnel. There's no contract, there's no nothing. So from there, we are like, oh.
00:27:00.264 - 00:27:09.924, Speaker B: Yeah, so, but Mercurial was first. And then what about Meteora? Like, what was the order of these products being built?
00:27:10.554 - 00:27:27.642, Speaker A: Yeah, so basically mercurial first, then we launch Jupiter. After that, the whole FTX crash and everything, we feel like we need to reset the whole narrative for mercurial. That's why we launch Meteora as part of Mercurial.
00:27:27.738 - 00:27:40.094, Speaker B: Okay, cool. Now that story makes sense. So let's get into Jupiter. When Jupiter started, what was the product offering, and how has that changed since the beginning?
00:27:40.644 - 00:28:10.394, Speaker A: It's always the same thing, right? Finding the best price for user to swap on Solana. One thing that's very different on Solana was the CtRl miss that. You know, gas fees is fixed on Solana. So it doesn't really matter how complicated the routing is as long as you're willing to pay. I mean, back there's only 200,000 compute units. So as long as you can fit anything under 200,000, then you can do something cool. Right? So that's why the routing wasn't that exciting back then.
00:28:10.394 - 00:28:45.580, Speaker A: You know, you can only do 200,000, so you can only do 200,000 compute. So it's very simple, like sometimes single hop, maybe a simple split, that's it. But that was the goal, finding the best price for the users and they don't have to pay extra for the fees, unlike Ethereum. Ethereum you can find like the most complicated route that use up a shit ton of like gas. But at the same time gas is not treatment on Ethereum. So if I can find you like a really good price, right, even it's like 1% better, it might cost you two or 3% more on the gas. But also Lana is very different.
00:28:45.580 - 00:28:50.348, Speaker A: Like we can find you even $0.01 better, you still pay the same price. Yeah.
00:28:50.436 - 00:29:29.974, Speaker B: Right. And so for any, just for context, for anybody listening, Jupiter is, well, you guys have a lot more product offerings now, but in the beginning it was basically just a, a Defi aggregator would find you the best swaps across different protocols. So let me ask you, how hard was that considering the sort of open source idl sort of stuff across the ecosystem? How challenging was that for you to sort of get what you needed to be able to actually do the routing and that hops because you gotta either be able to reverse engineer some of this stuff or have the idls and, or just know what that, what that looks like. Was that challenging to get started?
00:29:30.514 - 00:29:58.938, Speaker A: Yeah, so the, I think radio was still like, I mean, I think until this day they were still closed source. But a good thing is like, you know, the ecosystem back there was very small, right. You can like basically jump in the telegram group, talk to pretty much everyone who's building a savannah. Yeah. So we have to like, it wasn't hard. I think most, the most difficult constraints mostly on the contract side. Like I just mentioned, early days was only 200,000.
00:29:58.938 - 00:30:21.728, Speaker A: Computing like, you know, it's very hard to build on top of that. The only thing that you have to figure out is like how do you create more instruction just so that you can get more than 200,000, right. You know, it was like one instruction, 200,000. Then you have two instructions, like 400,000. So I have to like, instead of like doing everything in one instruction, we have to figure out like let's make it like multiple instructions. Swap. Yeah, so stuff like that.
00:30:21.728 - 00:30:43.840, Speaker A: Talking to radio was fun, you know, like they are still close off. Like I think for the v one that was back then, that's what they had. Serum was easy because serum, everything's open source. You know, they have like this, you know, like two distinct open source idea. OCA was easy as well. They were using the SPL standard program. So that was easy.
00:30:43.840 - 00:31:02.926, Speaker A: I mean back then it was only like three or four different sort of. Then after that all the new integration is very different as well. People come to us instead of like we reaching out to them. So they help us. They were usually like, you know, these are all the things that you need to do. You need to swap on like X and Y and Z. Yeah, I mean.
00:31:02.950 - 00:31:22.056, Speaker B: Like in the beginning it's like this, like nobody really knows you too much and then like you have to beg to get it. And then like you build a killer experience and then like it's a cold start problem. But then once you build a killer product, everybody's like, yo, we want to be on Jupiter. Like you guys are crushing it. So. And then people were reaching out. So that's awesome.
00:31:22.056 - 00:31:39.164, Speaker B: So like that was the beginning. You guys were pretty much an aggregator, doing the best routing for the best prices. But things have changed. You guys are more than just that now. So what, what's the, what's the evolution been like, like since just only doing that?
00:31:39.744 - 00:32:26.002, Speaker A: I mean, um, it's always part of the plan. We always want to offer this thing that's free, that everyone come to a safe morning. Then we always want to do what are the things that we can build outside of the simple swap experience? What are the things we can build? We listen to our users a lot or they say, you have this sort of experience, can I do DCA? Can I do lean order? Can I do all this thing? The first two new products that we launch are DCA. DC is actually like a very, I mean like DCA limit order. These two products are very, actually very simple. It's very simple contract, but it builds on top of the swap experience. You know, if you're someone who's not consistently in front of your computer, you have no idea like what you want to buy.
00:32:26.002 - 00:32:42.814, Speaker A: So you can set out a limit order that build on top of the swap API that. Okay. Like, I just want to buy Solana when it hits like, you know, like $99 when it's 100, stuff like that. Um, it's a very simple setup on the limit order we charge. I think it's like 0.1% of like fees or something like that. I don't remember.
00:32:42.814 - 00:33:06.476, Speaker A: What's the fees like then we also have the DCA product. It's the same thing. Um, you know, I just want to buy um, like Solana over the course of like one, one day, like, you know, one, like seven days, like one month. I don't care about the price I'm going to pay. Like I'll just put like this amount. All these things are built off the swap API just, you know, just to get more users on the swap API?
00:33:06.580 - 00:33:07.268, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:07.436 - 00:33:26.024, Speaker A: Then last year, I think early last year I was talking to like one of my engineers, like, yo, like let's, let's do something different and just like, not, not like the swap API. That's how we came up with the whole like, you know, like the perpetual product right now.
00:33:26.364 - 00:33:34.758, Speaker B: And as it was, like before we get into like the most recent stuff, is that the last like additional product you had added was perpetual. Perpetuals.
00:33:34.846 - 00:33:43.502, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. On the Ui. I mean the last one is actually the launch pad which we have helped launch the vent token and also the Jupyter token.
00:33:43.558 - 00:33:53.434, Speaker B: Right. That's what I was gonna, that's what I was getting to somewhere recently. So like you guys have launched, you've have bet. Well, you guys have launched a launch platform to be able to launch tokens.
00:33:53.874 - 00:33:54.594, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:54.754 - 00:33:59.602, Speaker B: And like you tested it out first like with Mark Chupe, right?
00:33:59.738 - 00:34:00.266, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:00.370 - 00:34:10.738, Speaker B: And then like the, the win meme token, the cat token, and then like more, more recently you guys have launched the, the actual Jupiter token.
00:34:10.906 - 00:34:11.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:11.410 - 00:34:33.463, Speaker B: So can you, can you explain to me like what you guys like actually built in this launch platform? Like what it actually, because you could say like launch platform or whatever, like, but to me it's like, couldn't I just use just basically minatoken and then I'm just curious what went into this and what the actual launch platform actually is and does.
00:34:34.483 - 00:34:57.113, Speaker A: So we always want to do a launch pad in the sense that people come to Jupyter all the time. So we do get attention of users coming to us, but a lot of products, they just don't have the luxury of users coming to like their website. So the goal there is always to help other projects to get more attention from the users that we have. Right, okay.
00:34:57.233 - 00:35:12.305, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So you guys are leveraging your platform for not only just like, to be able to facilitate the whole thing, but also, like, distribution, so that you can leverage your distribution network to give attention to other people's. Okay. That makes a lot of sense.
00:35:12.369 - 00:35:47.224, Speaker A: So that was the goal then when we announced that we do launch, you know, the Jupiter tokens, everyone's coming to us, like, yo, like, if you guys are airdropping, like, a million users, the network will die. Like, you know, don't do that. Like, you know, figure out a way to, like, do it properly. You know, like, make sure that it's like, you know, like, like people, like, can claim, like, in badges and stuff like that. We were like, okay, like, uh, you know, why don't just try out something, right? Like, just do it. Like, that's how mock juke came along. We just want to make sure that the network can survive.
00:35:47.224 - 00:36:13.384, Speaker A: Same thing for the first launch, first launchpad project, vent, token as well. It was the same idea. Can we airdrop to a million users and get everyone in the ecosystem to be ready? It's actually very exciting. I'm pretty sure when you see the wan launch, Phantom went down and you have some wallet. Barely can kill. A lot of RPC died along the way. But I think there's very good lessons for everyone in the ecosystem.
00:36:13.384 - 00:36:17.644, Speaker A: Phantom was like, oh, holy shit. I couldn't even handle, like, the.
00:36:17.804 - 00:36:45.044, Speaker B: There's no doubt about it, these things suck in the moment for whoever's experiencing it. But, like, it's just like, when in 2022 for the Solana network, all that does is harden it because, like, really smart people go solve those problems so the next time that doesn't happen. So, like, as much as it sucks for a lot of people in those moments, like, all that does is mean the next time that it's, like, it's gonna be resolved because they'll figure out what went wrong. So, like, it's good. It's not good in general.
00:36:45.624 - 00:36:52.736, Speaker A: Exactly. So from the ven launch to the Joop launch, it was only like, what, two weeks? One week? One week, actually, everything.
00:36:52.800 - 00:36:54.288, Speaker B: Just one week. Just one week.
00:36:54.336 - 00:37:18.486, Speaker A: Yeah. So everyone has to get ready for the whole launch. I remember after the event launch, we were talking to Brian from Triton. I think we need a lot more RPC servers and whatnot. I think we went for, like, 20 dedicated servers to, like, 60 dedicated servers just to get ready for the launch. Same thing for Phantom as well. It was like, go, like, kinging Phantom the whole time.
00:37:18.486 - 00:37:37.674, Speaker A: It's like, yo, no one can use, like, no. Like, phantom to swap right now. Like, it's very slow and stuff like that. Then they have to talk to their provider as well. Like, I think. I think Blowfish have to scale up their infrastructure just for the launch as well. It's very cool concept, right? Like that.
00:37:37.674 - 00:38:07.212, Speaker A: On a normal web two company, if you build something, you launch something. No one you can, everything's on you. You don't work with anyone in the ecosystem. It's like you launching this and your competitor wants you to fail, but it's very different. Throughout this launch, we learned so many things from everyone in the ecosystem. Brian Triton's providing us the RPC servers. We have a backup with helios as well.
00:38:07.212 - 00:38:21.660, Speaker A: And helix, like, you know, murt and, uh, Liam was, like, helping a lot. Nice. We have, like, you know, we talked to the Phantom team very closely to make sure that the world is, like, working. Like, well, soul flair as well. Um. Like, I think it's a very good relationship that everyone's like, sorry.
00:38:21.732 - 00:38:29.116, Speaker B: Oh, no, no, no. You're good. I was just gonna pair it. What you said, like. Like that sort of stuff. Like, it's my favorite thing when all these teams are working together like that.
00:38:29.140 - 00:38:29.316, Speaker A: Dude.
00:38:29.340 - 00:38:32.464, Speaker B: Like, that's how you win. Like, as an. As an ecosystem.
00:38:33.504 - 00:38:41.440, Speaker A: Exactly. So it's like, you know, after. After this whole launch, right. I'm very confident that. I'm pretty sure now. I want to know, yo. Holy shit.
00:38:41.440 - 00:38:47.288, Speaker A: We handle this thing very well, right? We can do a lot crazy. Like, a lot more crazier thing right now, right?
00:38:47.376 - 00:39:05.304, Speaker B: I'm not gonna lie, though. I had the 2022 PTSD. I was looking at the ping time the day before, and it wasn't. Well, it wasn't perfect, like, on the network. And I was like, fuck, please. No. So I had some pretty extreme.
00:39:07.364 - 00:39:19.644, Speaker A: No, just you, right? Everyone, like, I was like, fuck that. Like. Like, hopefully the network can keep out and stuff like that, even internally. All the engineers, like, were bad things. Like, can we bring, like, do you think we will bring the network out? Do we think we will bring the network up?
00:39:19.764 - 00:39:29.444, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, to be honest, like, anatoly would have been cheering it on. He'd be like, good job taking down the network. Now let's go fix it. That's like, that's just how. He's just honest.
00:39:29.484 - 00:39:29.958, Speaker A: That's.
00:39:30.076 - 00:39:45.562, Speaker B: He like, that. Like, just intellectually honest, like, you know, like, Solana's not even near its end state that that could happen. Like, knock on wood. I don't want that to happen. But, like, you know, it. You know, we're. Solana's building a thing that nobody's ever built in the history of humankind.
00:39:45.562 - 00:39:56.944, Speaker B: Like, like, at this scale, decentralized sort of network. So it's, it's, it's pretty big. I wrote in 2022 when radium was doing their launch pad.
00:39:57.114 - 00:39:57.864, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:59.684 - 00:40:11.692, Speaker B: Well, yeah, they were doing this when the network just already was horrible. And every time we heard, like, I would hear about, like, radium doing another launch, I'm like, please don't. Please told me that. But whatever.
00:40:11.828 - 00:40:25.476, Speaker A: Like, and the crazy thing is that our skill is probably like hundred, like, maybe a thousand times more than what, what radio was doing back then. And, like, surprised me. Like, everything was looking very, like, very good.
00:40:25.580 - 00:40:43.824, Speaker B: And those back in the radium days when, when the network really hit those, like, issues, um, you could do a hundred nft mint. That would have fucked things up, to be honest. It was just very bad. Six to eight months. Um, I'll, let's. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I want to forget it forever.
00:40:43.824 - 00:41:55.284, Speaker B: But anyways, like, congratulations on all this stuff, like the, everything from just, you've been here a long time, all the products you've created, finally landing on Jupiter, getting down this routing stuff, getting the best price for users, and then at the same time building some additional products, including this launch pad, which is what's going to be awesome. I want to shift gears a little bit because I want to be conscious of everybody's time, but I'm going to start out. I got a series of questions I want to ask you. The very first one, because you've been here for so long and have you seen the evolution of the developer experience? How different is it from when you started in early 2021 building on Solana compared to now? Like, with everything from, like, I'm sure you don't really read content tutorials, but just what? Just everything. You know, there's, there's indexers out there, there's. There's better RPC's, there's anchor, there's like a bunch of different series of tools. And I'm sure you guys have hand rolled your own, but like, when you've been developing and writing code, like, how much easier is things that you can find what you want compared to, like, then and now situation for you personally?
00:41:55.744 - 00:42:34.076, Speaker A: I mean, obviously it's very different right now, right? Um, you know, you mentioned the Pollx thing. That was the only thing back then, right? It's like, yo, when, when a new engineer joins us, we'll be like, yo, just read this thing like you. Nothing else you can read. And then try to go deep into source code right now. Right then in the last like a year or two years, like, uh, we have, we, so DCA is built by engineer just joy, like less than a year ago, right? Like he was a ethereum, like a contract engineer. Now, like he's doing like full time Solana contract. Like obviously the different, like the experience very different right now, right? I told him the poll x thing.
00:42:34.076 - 00:42:45.196, Speaker A: He was like, yo, why should I read these things? Like, there's so many like good examples right there, out there right now. I was like, oh, cool, like, I didn't even know about it. Then they have to like start telling me, I love doing this thing.
00:42:45.220 - 00:43:21.004, Speaker B: That's like, yeah, sometime at one point in time I'd love, like maybe in messages later I'd love to hear like actually how, how he went, like what he used in order to do that. You know, some people do tutorials, some read the docs which have gotten a lot better since then. Cookbook, some people like, will do it. There's, there's like five different ways that people learn. And I'm just curious how somebody like, because when people ask me coming from Ethereum how to learn Solana, I'm like, erase your memory, forget everything you know about like blockchains and then restart from scratch on Solana. That's how you do it.
00:43:21.784 - 00:43:48.114, Speaker A: I feel like a lot of time is less about the writing, the code, it's more about the conceptual. You know, concepts like programming model, like PDA, like all like accounts, accounts, like account base. Like that's one big thing, right? For a lot of people coming for Ethereum, it's like, like, what the fuck this accounts? Like, where do I have to pass it in? Like, yeah, on Solana is like a big giant. I mean, on Ethereum is a big giant, like state machine. Like a machine that you can just call, I mean, anything that you want.
00:43:48.154 - 00:43:54.450, Speaker B: Right now if you came from, if you're coming from Linux, you might have a little bit better of a time because it's going to be a little more similar.
00:43:54.642 - 00:44:00.810, Speaker A: Uh, yeah, exactly. So it's like, like that is like the idea, right? Yeah.
00:44:01.002 - 00:44:25.094, Speaker B: So what would you, so like just really quick we'll do like some like shotgun questions. Like, so, like right now, like for you, like what's, what's the bane of your existence? Like what is the worst thing about building own Solana for you right now and your developer experience, like what is the worst, what's the thing that when you. You have to deal with it every. If it's something every day or just occasionally, like, what's that thing for you that's just like, this is horrible. I can't do this.
00:44:26.914 - 00:44:31.146, Speaker A: Like, if you're talking about contract development, it's like, that's whatever you want.
00:44:31.210 - 00:44:32.074, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, anything.
00:44:32.154 - 00:44:40.854, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like stack and heat memory management. Like, yeah, that's, like, still horrible. Yeah. It's very hard to know as well. Yeah.
00:44:41.194 - 00:44:49.484, Speaker B: How do you fix that? Like, like, is there something that could be done, like, from somebody else that could make that better for you? Or is this at the protocol level?
00:44:50.304 - 00:45:05.632, Speaker A: Um, I think just like a few convenient methods to figure it out. And it's very hard to know as well. Like, now we are spending a lot of time optimizing Cu as well. Compute unit. Like, you. You move code around, like, sometimes added more code, but the Cu go down. We are like, the fuck.
00:45:05.632 - 00:45:11.486, Speaker A: But it should have cost more. But what's going down? And these are the things that we have no idea about.
00:45:11.550 - 00:45:27.354, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Okay, so now the next question is, like, what do you enjoy about building on Solana? What's the, like, I'm talking, like, from, like, for you, like, purely technical coding. Like, what's the. What's the thing that, like, makes you excited about building on it? It actually doesn't have to be technical. It can be whatever you want.
00:45:28.054 - 00:45:47.968, Speaker A: Um, like, personally, I just like the fact that, like, uh, all the. When you do something and, you know, it's challenging, you can always ask people around you to help, like, you know, people in the ecosystem. Like, you know, like someone calling me. New idea now Anker is being run by, uh, like, uh, Achille right now. He's like, very been like, yeah, he.
00:45:47.976 - 00:45:56.456, Speaker B: Built Solana playground, which is basically remix for Solana. And then he got moved over, so, like, which is awesome. He's, he's, he's incredible. Um, so.
00:45:56.560 - 00:45:58.576, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah.
00:45:58.600 - 00:46:48.080, Speaker B: So your, your, your favorite thing that we get this a lot. Like, this happens a lot. Lot, to be honest. It's like people were, like, came for the tech, stayed for the vibes, and, like, really what that means for most engineers is like, it's a very welcoming ecosystem. Anybody's willing to help, whether it's on Twitter, discord, telegram, they don't care. You know, like, you can ask a tech question on Twitter and you'll have, you'll have ten people try to help you, which is like, can't ask for anything more than that. I don't even like, so, yeah, so what? So the final question I always ask everybody is like, if you, you probably, like, I don't know how if you have any young people coming on your Jupiter team, but, like, let's say you have, like, some young new developer that's thinking about building on Solana or, like, is just getting started and, like, they're, they want to be successful.
00:46:48.080 - 00:46:58.236, Speaker B: Like, what advice would you give, like, this next generation that trying to build on Solana? Because it's not easy. So, like, what, what would you tell that person that's like, trying to do, like, get started?
00:46:58.420 - 00:47:26.624, Speaker A: Actually, I get that questions all the time. Like, you know, people dm me. It's like, you're like, what do you think about, like, what are the things that, like, I need to build? Like, I always tell them it's like, yo, like, stop thinking what to build to become the next, you know, billion dollar protocol, whatnot. Like, just, just start building. It's like simple things that you think doesn't work. Just build it right now. Like, don't spend too much time thinking about, oh, this is not worth building because it won't be like, you know, the Dex billion dollar idea.
00:47:26.624 - 00:47:35.416, Speaker A: This is not worth building. It's like, because, like, you know, all these business cases that might not be like, you know, there or whatever, it's like, just build.
00:47:35.480 - 00:47:49.724, Speaker B: Just jump in. Just jump in there and start building, like something that maybe nobody will ever use, but because it's just cool and you, and you like it and you think it's a cool problem to solve, just build it and make it work and then figure out the rest of the shit later.
00:47:50.144 - 00:48:06.968, Speaker A: He said, acheron is a very good idea. Right? He was building the remix of, like, you know, Solana. I remember he started with, like, not even thinking about that. It was like doing something very simple. Like, we were talking about it. They started like, take on like this, like, you know, cool, big project. Himself alone, right?
00:48:07.016 - 00:48:35.538, Speaker B: Yeah, it was, it was really funny. Like, he, I didn't know him. He dmed me one day and was just like, hey, I built this thing. Have you ever heard of remix? And I was like, go on. And he was like, well, I kind of built that for Solana. And I messaged Jacob, who's head of Devrel now, is like, dude, you're not going to believe this, but, like, somebody actually built revix for Solana. And then eventually, like, they, they got introduced and like, everybody's like, this is huge.
00:48:35.538 - 00:48:50.444, Speaker B: Like, it is. It's a huge. It's a huge tool that didn't exist on Solana, that existed on EVM. And, like, you know, there's a lot of pain for people building on windows, machines especially, that now have another alternative without having to deal with that.
00:48:51.304 - 00:49:00.720, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. I mean, that's one thing I'm like, I always tell people. It's like, just build, like, stop thinking about the business use case or whatever. Right?
00:49:00.752 - 00:49:34.616, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's good advice. And, like, you're not the first person to say it. And when I keep hearing the same thing over and over again, like, it's typically pretty strong advice, you know, like, when I do this show, it's like the, like, you start to see some repetition and the answers that people give, which is, like, a high signal that, like, these are something that people should be listening to. And this show is really for people to hear people's journeys. You know, like, you. You jumped onto Solana, had no idea about it. And, like, here you guys are with, like, the highest volume sort of defi project on Solana.
00:49:34.616 - 00:49:36.920, Speaker B: Like, that people need to listen and pay attention.
00:49:36.992 - 00:49:40.240, Speaker A: Solana. No, like, you know, sometimes we beat uniswap as well, actually.
00:49:40.312 - 00:50:05.240, Speaker B: Sorry, my bad. That is true. Um, and, like, that's. That's insane. And so, like, the lesson in there is just, like, just build it doesn't mean you're going to get it right the first time, like it did with your guys first protocol. And if you fail, which I don't think you really failed, but you were just like, we have some better ideas, and you did that. And then, like, people who just keep grinding like you knew nothing about Solana, like, three, two and a half, three years ago.
00:50:05.240 - 00:50:12.694, Speaker B: And now here you are with, like, one of the most prolific, like, defi protocols in all of blockchain.
00:50:13.394 - 00:50:17.698, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we have more than 100,000 user, like, sometimes like a day.
00:50:17.826 - 00:50:18.202, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:18.258 - 00:50:23.034, Speaker A: Like, how many. How many protocol? They can tell people that. More than 100,000 daily users.
00:50:23.154 - 00:50:28.214, Speaker B: Well, you need to get all of Malaysia using Jupiter. So, like, you just get. You get a. You get on that.
00:50:29.914 - 00:50:33.314, Speaker A: Actually, surprisingly, Indonesia is bleeping. No.
00:50:33.354 - 00:50:37.494, Speaker B: Yeah, so they're there. We know that Indonesia is, like, super heavy user base.
00:50:37.914 - 00:50:42.520, Speaker A: So, like, that's no volume, but, like, high, high count.
00:50:42.632 - 00:50:46.336, Speaker B: Yeah, but hey, man, like, that's helping people out. They're probably like, it's.
00:50:46.440 - 00:50:48.472, Speaker A: That's exactly how we should be.
00:50:48.648 - 00:51:06.642, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Well, anyways, man, uh, we've come to that time. It's the end. See, on, like, thanks for coming, man. Like, I'm glad of actually that you pushed this off a few times on us, rightfully so, you had something more important, like, the Jupiter launch to to take care of. But it's kind of.
00:51:06.658 - 00:51:07.594, Speaker A: I feel bad for that.
00:51:07.674 - 00:51:39.724, Speaker B: No, don't feel bad. Like, it's actually kind of cool that I get a like, that we got to talk directly after it and hear the story and, like. And hear, like, what you guys have been up to, like, here on your hearing your story and, like, and just how you landed here and how this has all been built in just such a short amount of time is, like, this whole thing is for younger developers to watch as inspiration. So, like, this is a real. This is, like, I really enjoyed this conversation, so thanks for coming, man. And I'll see you out there on the interwebs. Cheers, everybody.
