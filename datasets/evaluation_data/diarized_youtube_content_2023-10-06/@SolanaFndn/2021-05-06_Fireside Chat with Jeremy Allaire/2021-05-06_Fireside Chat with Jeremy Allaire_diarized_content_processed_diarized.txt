00:08:57.274 - 00:08:57.854, Speaker A: Cool.
00:09:04.594 - 00:09:34.790, Speaker B: Okay, looks like. Looks like we're alive. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the now third event of the Solana season, hackathon. Today we're doing a fireside chat with Jeremy Lear, who's the CEO and co founder of Circle, and Anatoliankovanko, who is the co founder and CEO of Solana. This will be about a 30 to 45 minutes conversation, really free form. If you all have any questions for the speakers during the event, please drop all your comments on the right hand side over there with your questions.
00:09:34.790 - 00:09:53.534, Speaker B: And we'll take some time at the very end to try to address everything. I think since we're already seven minutes over and we have 300 people in here, we're just going to jump right into it. So, I think, Jeremy, you really don't need an introduction, but if you want to take 30 seconds just to let everyone know who you are, and then, Toli, I'll let you take it from here.
00:09:54.514 - 00:10:23.456, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Great to be on. This is awesome. I'm Jeremy Lair, as noted CEO here at Circle. And, yeah, have been building software platforms, tools, infrastructure, and other services in the Internet space for almost 30 years, and really excited about all of the really amazing developer activity that's happening with Solana.
00:10:23.456 - 00:10:33.232, Speaker A: And we're just happy to be a developer right there, building stuff on Solana as well with USDC. So great to have you. Great to be on with you guys.
00:10:33.328 - 00:10:40.164, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah, everybody runs their own podcasts. Okay. I always get confused who's on his show.
00:10:41.304 - 00:10:42.864, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:10:43.884 - 00:10:51.064, Speaker C: So I kind of. Can you tell us, like, about the kind of explosive growth of circle over the last year?
00:10:51.604 - 00:11:55.874, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, just for perspective, like, for a long time, actually, eight years ago when we started, we were like, there has to be a way to be able to kind of take fiat and build digital currency models around it. Do that as, like, an open protocol layer that could run on the public Internet the same way we have information layers that wasn't really technically possible until you had the second generation of blockchains. And once that came around, we saw that we could actually build a protocol layer for dollars on the Internet and eventually other fiat currencies and created USDC. Now, that grew during 2018 2019, but really starting last year, really actually quite correlated to the pandemic. We just started seeing incredible growth. And, yeah, I mean, I think when we started chatting with you guys about working on something, I mean, it was maybe like 500 million USDC in circulation.
00:11:55.874 - 00:12:05.302, Speaker A: So really in the last year, it's grown 30 x. I mean, USDC, 500 million on Solana.
00:12:05.398 - 00:12:06.134, Speaker C: Just Solana.
00:12:06.214 - 00:12:32.394, Speaker A: Yeah, just Solana has 500 million. That's just in a few short months. Right? So it's been amazing. So, you know, that we've grown from, yeah, 500 million in circulation to, you know, on January 1, there was 4 billion in circulation. We were pretty happy with that growth. But from 4 billion now to, you know, basically 15 billion in circulation now is really, really amazing. And so, you know, we're oftentimes adding a billion per week.
00:12:32.394 - 00:13:09.234, Speaker A: So it's grown a lot. And just the on chain transaction volume is well over 500 billion in the last year. And I think for us, we've been building out a broader set of stuff around it as well, which we can talk to if it's relevant. But I think the really important thing is we're seeing USDC brought to more chains, getting onto infrastructure where you can do retail scale applications, you could do capital markets scale applications. Other things are really exciting developments, too.
00:13:09.734 - 00:13:14.114, Speaker C: Do you know what the main use case is driving this globally?
00:13:14.774 - 00:14:41.550, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think at a high level, there's sort of like. I like to describe it as like three waves of adoption. And actually, like, when, if you go back and read the original white paper around the creation of USDC on Center IO, we have a very broad vision of basically connecting every person, every business, every financial service, everywhere, using a set of common protocols for money. And so when people ask me, well, what do people use USDC for? What could it be used for? I'm like, well, what would you use a dollar for? I mean, literally, it should be micro payments for a digital collectible that's fractions of a penny to its collateral in a bond issue that's happening on a blockchain, and it's everything in between. In some ways, when you look at the uses of USDC today, we actually see that breadth of use cases. We see these very big, bulky capital markets type things on one end, and then people doing really innovative things with streaming payments for people who are employees are getting streamed payments, and they're getting paid out in countries like Argentina and other places. And it's like innovations that are happening that are only possible with on chain dollars in this way.
00:14:41.550 - 00:15:37.876, Speaker A: So use cases are broad, but when you actually look at it and sort of say, okay, where's the bulk of it coming from? Again, I look at it in sort of three waves of adoption. The first wave of adoption is USDC as one of the really preferred settlement mediums for the crypto capital markets, basically. So basically, as digital asset markets have grown all around the world and have become mainstream. And as more institutional capital has come in to this as just an asset class and a market, having a reliable, trusted, you know, always redeemable dollar, digital currency has been really important. And so it's grown very much alongside the growth there, the second. And so that's like the first wave, right? And that's where it started. And that's probably, it's got the biggest wave right now.
00:15:37.876 - 00:16:30.094, Speaker A: I know you guys do a lot of waves and beaches and stuff in your metaphor, so I'm trying to work with that here. And then the second wave really was born out of innovation that was happening with on chain protocols like Defi innovation. So interest rate markets, borrowing, lending markets, other kind of financial market primitives that are being built on chain has been a huge growth driver as well. So if you look at USDC, that's locked in defi contracts, it's really huge. And so the growth of defi has also been a really, really big driver of growth of USDC. So that's the second wave. And it's not quite as big as the first wave, but it's growing really fast.
00:16:30.094 - 00:17:23.355, Speaker A: And then the third wave is what I'll call is generalized settlements. And so we have, it's amazing how many venture capital companies are now making their investments with USDC. We have businesses, we have thousands of businesses who sign up for circle accounts, which are like business accounts, and who are like, I want to use this for receiving payments or making payments or other things. So people are realizing that this is just a really great form factor for dollars and are adopting it. And we're seeing growth in things like USDC, in more mainstream, like NFT marketplaces, which are bringing in new users who have never really thought of stable coins. So that third wave, which is more generalized payments and settlement, is sort of the smallest. But it's also, I think, going to probably over time, grow to be as big or bigger than any of the others.
00:17:23.355 - 00:17:24.943, Speaker A: And that's certainly our thesis.
00:17:27.403 - 00:17:39.583, Speaker C: Are the volumes at this point, I guess the numbers big enough that this is unstoppable, this is no longer an experiment. Are we past that point?
00:17:40.324 - 00:18:26.388, Speaker A: Well, it's interesting, I think that the phenomenon of these standardized dollar, digital currencies that are on public chains that have regulated private sector financial institutions around them and so on, I think that's unstoppable. I think that's going to grow massively. I think it will grow eventually to trillions of, you know, of value. And we look at it as if you step back, actually, and you look at m two, the m two money supply, which is commercial bank money, which is, I call it ach money. M two around the world is $100 trillion, okay? That's privately issued. That's privately issued money. Because banks are issuers of money.
00:18:26.388 - 00:19:16.242, Speaker A: They create money and they create their own form of electronic money. They have standards for interoperability. Some of those are okay, some of those suck terribly, but, like, m two is $100 trillion and fiat digital currency that is in this new form factor that is on the Internet from Internet based financial services firms or Internet finance companies like Circle and many others, like Coinbase and many others who are in the crypto space growing around the world. I think that over the long run, yeah, I think this form of digital currency will eat share from m two. M two is growing a lot because there's a lot of m zero and m one being injected into the actual money supply. So those numbers are growing as well, but, yeah, yeah.
00:19:16.298 - 00:19:36.372, Speaker C: So when I think of adoption, when people say, like, the sum of digital currencies that have been issued on chain is like, I think close to like 75 billion. Now, I should be thinking, okay, we're like, we're like 0.75% on the adoption curve, and it's just going to go to that. Absolutely.
00:19:36.548 - 00:20:28.598, Speaker A: I mean, and the other angle on this, and I know you guys think about this, too, when you're thinking about, like, how do you build, you know, a blockchain for web scale applications? Right? You know, there's a lot of different measures on this, but, like, you know, there's. There's probably like 150 million end users that are on blockchain, so to speak, that have, you know, that hold crypto, that use heb wallets, other things. And that's growing. It's grown at a nice rate. But, like, this is like, if you go to, you know, 1998 or whatever, when, you know, you were still in dial up Internet and it was kind of quirky and people were like, well, I see the value, but you kind of had to be into it. And it was, you know, it's a lot of hype. There's all this stuff going on, huge amounts of money, all this stuff, but, like, it was like 150 million people and, you know, but was it going to be billions? Yeah.
00:20:28.598 - 00:20:50.494, Speaker A: Was it going to maybe take five years? Yeah. So I think we're on a path to billions of people who connect to these public networks and, and then who want to use public, you know, publicly available digital currencies like this. And so it'll probably take three or five years. But, yeah, it should. It should be quite, quite larger by then.
00:20:51.594 - 00:21:04.370, Speaker C: Awesome. Yeah. 98 was an interesting time because I remember that as, like, when you started seeing like, friendster, like, like six degrees as these applications.
00:21:04.482 - 00:21:06.314, Speaker A: I think that was even before friendster.
00:21:06.434 - 00:21:17.620, Speaker C: Yeah, this was six degrees. Was like six degrees. Yeah, yeah. And that was like, to me, like, wow, this is an Internet only thing that. Yeah.
00:21:17.772 - 00:21:19.804, Speaker A: Is that like bit clout today or something?
00:21:19.884 - 00:21:25.020, Speaker C: Like, you know, every human in the world has a token.
00:21:25.212 - 00:22:06.788, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but. Right, like the, you know, you know, what is, what is dapper marketplace or opensea or, you know, you take, you take these projects and you're like, oh, this is only possible because of crypto. It's only possible because of digital assets. It's only possible because of these public chains and what you can do and, you know. But you're saying that, yeah, I might want to, like, sell my beanie baby on the Internet or that's interesting, but I don't really trust this or this is too complicated or, you know, I don't want to put my credit card in or whatever those things were back then. Right. That we're in a similar place and like, the companies that are building services and applications, you know, are there.
00:22:06.788 - 00:22:24.204, Speaker A: You know, a lot of these are going to turn into, like, huge customer bases. Some of them are going to totally die because they didn't innovate or they didn't deliver real value to customers. But for sure. I mean, I think we're. There's a good. It's good. It's a good analogous timeline.
00:22:25.424 - 00:22:39.844, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it just. I have, like, so much memory of that time as like, kind of the world changing so rapidly and kind of growing up, myself being like, coding as soon as I could figure it out.
00:22:40.184 - 00:22:42.364, Speaker A: Were you using coldfusion back then?
00:22:44.304 - 00:22:47.444, Speaker C: No, I was.
00:22:47.784 - 00:22:49.296, Speaker A: You're too smart for that.
00:22:49.480 - 00:22:57.244, Speaker C: I was one of the nerds that was building Linux at high school. Totally hopeless.
00:22:58.064 - 00:22:59.484, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, totally.
00:23:01.344 - 00:23:14.312, Speaker C: Yeah. I heard you call or describe USDC as a bear asset, is that correct? Can you deep dive into what that means, Andrew?
00:23:14.328 - 00:24:13.984, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, so I think in these constructs, USDC is a fully reserved digital currency that is issued by regulated financial institution like circle. But the tokenized dollar essentially is imbued with the characteristics of a digital currency. Once a USDC is a token on a blockchain, it inherits all of the attributes of those tokens. And those tokens, like a USDC token on Solana is a bare instrument. Like, if you have it, you have it. And once you've moved it from, you've moved it from one address to another address, it's a final settlement.
00:24:13.984 - 00:25:18.084, Speaker A: And so that's what, in general, digital currencies and digital assets are. They're bare assets. And I think that's bringing some of the characteristics of cash and the characteristics of the Internet and some of the characteristics of traditional payment systems. But I think really taking those characteristics together is that base layer. Now, you have regulations now that exist in most parts of the world, or all of the world, basically. Now where if you're an intermediary and you're holding this on behalf of other people or you're custodying this, you have to be registered, you need licenses. Most places, you have to be meeting international, know your customer, and any money laundering and countering terrorism, finance, there's a whole set of stuff you have to do, or you go to jail or get fined, or who knows? So that now exists, and it's pretty uniformly being applied around the world.
00:25:18.084 - 00:25:39.300, Speaker A: You do have intermediaries, just like banks as intermediaries, but the actual base layer is a barrier asset, and that's extraordinarily powerful, of course. And one of the things that makes digital currency have such utility value is.
00:25:39.332 - 00:25:49.644, Speaker C: That something, that concept, is that something that could apply to NFTs, to like, securities issued on chain and things like that?
00:25:50.184 - 00:26:28.268, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, there's, you know, so many different forms of tokens, right? We have governance tokens of a DeFi protocol. The governance token is a unique thing, right? It provides governance. It provides, you know, certain financial features. You need to present it to participate in voting. And those are bearer assets. You can transfer those freely. I think when you start NFTs themselves.
00:26:28.268 - 00:27:25.394, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. Are bare assets. Although I think people haven't yet fully groked the connection between the actual digital material substance, the providence of the origination of the NFT, and the connection between the digital material substance and the NFT itself. I think there's work to do there. Part of that is the convergence of decentralized file storage and nfts, and it's a different form of digital content and digital content ownership. But they are still these bare assets as well. But when you start bridging like USDC, it is a hybrid.
00:27:25.394 - 00:28:07.418, Speaker A: The market understands that there is a reserve of Federal reserve dollars, if you will, or dollar assets that are there. Just like if you had a tokenized house or tokenized ownership of some form of real estate, you could have that be a bearer asset for sure. If someone wanted to trade fractional ownership of the Mona Lisa or wanted to trade fractional ownership of a piece of real estate. The token itself could be a bearer asset. I think there's going to be questions. Yeah, go ahead.
00:28:07.466 - 00:28:19.170, Speaker C: So in my mind, I think the distinction is that if I accidentally transfer this token to invalid address, it's gone.
00:28:19.362 - 00:28:20.522, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
00:28:20.618 - 00:28:25.706, Speaker C: And that the issuer doesn't control, effectively, ownership.
00:28:25.850 - 00:28:45.408, Speaker A: Exactly. Right. So this is. You're going to see a spectrum of situations. Right. So, like, it's against the law. With a corporation that issues equity securities in the United States, it is against the law, or I should rather phrase it as opposed to being against the law.
00:28:45.408 - 00:29:19.354, Speaker A: It is a requirement that the company be able to reissue shares, that the cap table is a record. There's a legitimate form of. Of what is a legal cap table? There's a legal framework which law firms mostly hold these cap tables in their quote unquote, records. And if there's shares lost, or whatever happens when shares are lost, you can reissue shares.
00:29:20.094 - 00:29:24.190, Speaker C: Google Doc is still. Exactly.
00:29:24.342 - 00:30:18.184, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I think when you're dealing with that kind of external legal fiduciary kind of framework, tokens that are issued, they lose some of the bearer kind of concepts. Now, you could construct something legally where a fraction, let's say you could come up with a fractional ownership of a building that was truly tradable, and like, you could construct something that said, legally, if you lose this pro rata, everyone just gets the value, who's the rest of the owners? Or something, you could construct something legally where it could have more bear characteristics. But then that's still an underlying financial contract that everyone agrees to. You agree to that.
00:30:18.804 - 00:30:35.624, Speaker C: Got it. Yeah. These are things that, like, seems like Daos. Like you would have to, if you're trying to represent this as a smart contract in a truly kind of decentralized way, you'd have to carefully construct these rules into the contract itself.
00:30:36.164 - 00:31:06.954, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, very much. I mean, that'll be, you know, I think progressive jurisdictions like Wyoming and Delaware, who are trying to innovate in terms of corporate law and fundamentally the forms of entities, these new sort of corporate forms, and how they can issue value and enable participation. It's a wonderful place for innovation. It's something I'm particularly interested in.
00:31:07.654 - 00:31:18.804, Speaker C: Yeah, likewise, I think. I mean, this seems like much more secure than a Google Doc. Much more advice.
00:31:18.844 - 00:32:46.938, Speaker A: I mean, I guess it relates. It does relate to, like, you know, when I think about, like, what we're doing at circle, you know, we envision a world in the coming years. Where hundreds of thousands if not millions of businesses keep their treasury like keep their working capital, keep their treasury in digital currency. And that more and more of the economic relationships that they have as firms are mediated by smart contracts on blockchains, whether it be labor relationships or trade relationships or equity relationships or other things, we really see that more and more of the substance of corporate forms will want to operate natively in this. I think a corporation is essentially it's a token that has certain voting rights, that has certain economic rights, and that generally that token governs a treasury. That treasury is a treasury of the tokens themselves and what flavor of tokens they are. And it's a treasury of financial cash assets, dollar assets, and then there's governance from the top that then determines who can actually do things with the dollars or whatever currency it is.
00:32:46.938 - 00:33:08.734, Speaker A: And then it's a nexus of contracts, as people say, it's this nexus of contracts. And how can we have more and more of those contracts themselves become dematerialized or whatever you want to talk about, turn into software that has all these great characteristics that you can do on a blockchain.
00:33:09.994 - 00:33:30.254, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to imagine a world where once these contracts have been kind of like bulletproofed, unchained, that Wyoming just says, okay, if you use this particular smart contract, you're a corporation. Don't even get like a stamp.
00:33:30.914 - 00:34:33.870, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, for sure. And like look like it's sort of like open source, right? Like people are like, okay, this build of Linux, like, yeah, you can use this to run aeronautics on an airplane. Or I don't know, maybe you don't do that, but people are like, it's got a certain level of hardness to it that like, because so many people have validated it in terms of its security or its efficiency or whatever. And that's clearly like there's like a higher bar with smart contracts around that. But you can imagine sharing economy is such an interesting place because sharing economy, business models disrupted labor relationships to platforms and service delivery and were really, really powerful. But the next generation of that is going to get created and it's all going to be on chain and the labor contracts are going to be smart contracts and you're going to know exactly what you're getting, exactly what you're getting into. And as a labor market participant, you're going to be able to do that from anywhere in the world.
00:34:33.870 - 00:35:24.764, Speaker A: And it will probably create all kinds of creative ways for value exchange to happen between someone providing a service and the actual delivery of that service. I can imagine really, really powerful suites of, you know, employment protocols that get built on chain that eventually are composable into all kinds of forms. Right. That just makes so much sense that we would have. We would get to a world where employment protocols would be really popular and sort of businesses would be like, well, I'm just going to adopt that employment protocol, because it's just. It gives me the most flexibility with people who work and collaborate to create whatever it is that we're creating.
00:35:27.224 - 00:35:43.216, Speaker C: If you were, like, a seed stage startup, not circle, like, if you were like, okay, I'm getting into the space. What would you build? Like, how? Like, what do you like personally?
00:35:43.320 - 00:35:45.712, Speaker A: You want, like, actual, actual products?
00:35:45.848 - 00:35:46.564, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:48.234 - 00:35:51.534, Speaker A: Well, I have a lot of ideas for products, but I hope circle builds them, too.
00:35:51.994 - 00:35:52.854, Speaker C: Okay.
00:35:55.514 - 00:37:09.570, Speaker A: But, I mean, what I would say is. And actually, you know, it's interesting, my co founder, Sean Neville, who's very involved in the standards around USDC and is on my board of directors. Like, we talk about. About some of this stuff, and he's thinking about a lot of interesting things in the space. But I would just say, like, I mean, clearly, you know, the nature of corporate form would be a legal Dao, right? Like, that just seems like if I were starting a company or a project, I would absolutely start it as some form of legal Dow, not a classic Delaware equity corporation. And so just, that's definitely one thing I would say. And then really, the incentive design on how you can get people to collaborate with you and participate in building intellectual property or whatever it is you really can.
00:37:09.570 - 00:37:22.330, Speaker A: There's so much room for experimentation there now. So I would be thinking about that, but now we're like an old crufty company. It's hard to make those changes.
00:37:22.442 - 00:37:23.018, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:23.146 - 00:37:26.214, Speaker A: Yeah, we're not that old, but.
00:37:30.274 - 00:37:39.044, Speaker C: That'S crazy how fast the space moves if one of the fastest growing, innovative companies in the crypto is, like, too old.
00:37:40.104 - 00:37:41.324, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:37:42.384 - 00:37:59.912, Speaker C: Um, do you. Do you think that, like, um, the. The product cycle for. For the stuff is ready for, like, consumer level? Like. Like, are we ready, like, to get, like, we have a team building this awesome wallet. Phantom. I don't know if you had a chance to use that.
00:37:59.968 - 00:38:01.016, Speaker A: Phantom. Yeah, yeah.
00:38:01.120 - 00:38:07.986, Speaker C: Are. Do you think we can get, like, normal humans to use this stuff? Are we at that level?
00:38:08.130 - 00:38:30.894, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think. I think that we're close. We're not there yet, right. We're just not there yet. I think, you know, one of the biggest missing pieces is identity. And I think.
00:38:30.894 - 00:39:37.064, Speaker A: I think for this stuff to take hold there have to be ways for people to interact with decentralized infrastructure, with privacy preserving forms of identity. I think that will be key. And part of that is that that will be key to unlocking kind of mainstream scale financial access to this as well. But a lot of the applications have nothing to do with money. Right. They're, you know, but, you know, I think just the hurdle of people needing to understand crypto in the sense of seed phrases and private keys and other things is too high a hurdle. And so I know there are some really interesting projects that have experimented with that to make it easier.
00:39:37.064 - 00:39:55.924, Speaker A: There's smart contract wallets like Argent and others that are creating these Guardian models and using other forms of multi factor identity to instantiate a user experience that is easier. I think we're close. I think we're close. I think. Yeah.
00:39:55.964 - 00:40:07.944, Speaker C: What is this, like, what is the missing feature for normal humans that you think identity is useful for? Just identifying me as an atolly or recovery of my keys or like.
00:40:10.004 - 00:41:25.228, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think that part of it is to get DeFi and broader global interoperable peer to peer payments and just general payment acceptance. Like I'm Amazon and I'm going to start taking USDC payments or all these things. When you start getting to mainstream scale stuff like, you know, people want to deal with real, real humans. And I think the challenge is, you know, the legacy way of dealing with that is you create these closed loops, you know, like card issuers and credit card networks are these closed loops. PayPal's a closed loop. You know, you square is a closed loop, right? You have these kind of closed loops. But the public chains and public chain based financial applications, whether it's a peer to peer payment or lending money, borrowing money, all these things, they're completely open loop.
00:41:25.228 - 00:42:26.550, Speaker A: I mean, you know, but I think, you know, it's not going to be acceptable to not have some way for like an Amazon to say someone is with a zero knowledge proof proving to me that they are in fact a valid KYC individual. But I don't need to know who they are. I don't need them to give me their PII, but they can prove to me that, or a DeFi protocol that is accessed by institutional market participants. They may want to basically say, I want to be in a liquidity pool where I'm cryptographically proving, using zero knowledge proofs and some form of identity attestation that I'm interacting with other institutions. I don't need to know who they are, but I'm interacting with them. And the same thing with on a Dex or a serum Dex as an example. It's so powerful.
00:42:26.550 - 00:43:25.794, Speaker A: Of course, eventually, if you could put tokenized instruments on there, hedge funds would all love to trade on a decentralized infrastructure. No counterparty risk, all this things, but, like, from a legal perspective, they're going to want to be able to have these various forms of proof. So I think that's a key piece that's needed. That also can be applied to, like, simple ways to, like, you know, enable, enable different digital wallets to share value with each other without having to give out your identity handle, but still know that each user has been Kyc and stuff. So I think this is an area where there needs to be new standards that work on public chains that then can unlock and make things more usable.
00:43:32.394 - 00:43:35.954, Speaker C: Austin, there's some news that broke.
00:43:36.074 - 00:43:44.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I just wanted to jump in here. So, Jeremy, this kind of broke while we were on the call. It doesn't have to do with Solana, but it's really cool. I wanted to get your opinion on this live.
00:43:44.794 - 00:43:45.130, Speaker A: Yeah, sure.
00:43:45.162 - 00:43:59.454, Speaker B: Yeah. It announced the circle to team up with Tala, I believe it's pronounced to work with Visa to get crypto payments, adoption, emerging markets. I'm going to drop the link in the chat. You just kind of want to. It's really cool.
00:44:00.214 - 00:45:07.420, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, basically, Tala is building a whole payment system, or not even a payment system, but a payment application experience that leverages USDC as settlement in a wide range of emerging markets. It's attached to. So USDC is used throughout. It is attached to visa credentials as well. So every Tala wallet holder has a visa credential. And so I think the really important thing here is, and this is part of the work that we started with Visa when we announced our partnership with them in December, is they're really interested in a world where people can make payments to people all over the world using USDC, and then the people who receive that, and especially in emerging markets where people might not want to hold a local currency, they're more interested in holding a digital dollar, can then still use it.
00:45:07.420 - 00:45:56.444, Speaker A: So if I'm in Argentina and I have a tala wallet, I can receive USDC from anyone. I can send and receive it as well, peer to peer. I have it attached to a visa credential. So I can make a purchase online or I can go to the restaurant down the street and I'm essentially paying with USDC, but it's actually the visa network that is handling and facilitating that. So instead of traditional, this is a lot of these crypto based debit cards and stuff. Instead of a bank account, it's just USDC. And now visa has gone taken a step further, which is basically the Tala wallet, which is users holding USDC.
00:45:56.444 - 00:46:26.944, Speaker A: They present it to pay at the restaurant in their country. And then that tala actually can settle with Visa with USDC itself, instead of needing to convert it back into legacy fiat and get it through the swift, ach, all that stuff. They can just be visa. Here's my, here's my USDC address. At the end of the day, just send me the amount of USDC you owe as well.
00:46:27.604 - 00:46:32.464, Speaker C: So is that API to settle with via USDC? Is that open to anyone?
00:46:33.884 - 00:47:08.474, Speaker A: I mean, it is not meaning it's something. And there was an announcement earlier. Crypto.com is actually setting up and doing this as well, which is basically like the issuer of the card, which is, let's say it's tala or it's crypto.com or whatever, the issuer of the card. They're getting an instruction as to where to settle. And the visa net system orchestrates these ious.
00:47:08.474 - 00:47:32.034, Speaker A: Typically you'd get wire funds to this bank account or whatever, and you'd wire those funds and it would take t plus three or whatever, and eventually the funds would get there. And so there's these legacy fiat settlement pass. But now instead, it can just be like multiple times a day. Like, okay, there's this much USDC, send it to visa as USDC, which is pretty cool.
00:47:32.854 - 00:47:41.354, Speaker C: Yeah, that is really cool. And it's like the next baby step. Seems like issuing those ious on chain.
00:47:41.854 - 00:48:14.084, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, absolutely. Well, I mean, I think it's also like all these wallets that are all over the world that are being innovative. Like, they can. People can pay each other, obviously, with USDC, and then businesses themselves can open up a wallet and just take payments directly. Right. And that's obviously really something that we see happening a lot more in the coming years.
00:48:14.784 - 00:48:18.044, Speaker B: Is a bank account required to work with this.
00:48:19.944 - 00:48:21.804, Speaker A: By which participant?
00:48:22.344 - 00:48:27.280, Speaker B: The user. So do you need a bank account in order to get into this program, or could you.
00:48:27.352 - 00:48:48.174, Speaker A: No, no. This is the beauty. It's like you can get a Tala wallet as a user in one of these countries where it's available, get it through the App Store, and then you get a visa credential that's attached to it, and you get a virtual card. I think they're doing a physical card as well. And people can send you digital currency, and then you have it.
00:48:49.834 - 00:49:03.714, Speaker C: But you can effectively take credit. You have a credit account with visa that then you can sell with USDC. So my talla wallet is a credit card? In a sense, yeah.
00:49:03.874 - 00:49:27.784, Speaker A: I actually. I don't know if the tala is. I think tala is. I don't know that it's a credit instrument. I think it's a debit instrument. So it's more like someone either sends me money or I've managed to purchase it. Purchase digital currency and then put it in this.
00:49:27.784 - 00:49:44.364, Speaker A: Yeah. If you open up a checking account, it's empty, right? There's nothing in there. So you need to get funds into it. This is like opening up a digital currency account and then you need to get. Maybe you're working on a token project and they'll pay you in USDC.
00:49:47.064 - 00:49:59.244, Speaker C: Yeah, this is pretty cool. It's. The stuff seems like it moves at a glacial pace. But I think every one of these steps opens up, I think, a thousand new doors.
00:49:59.624 - 00:50:46.656, Speaker A: Totally. I mean, it's like the, you know, like a year ago or whatever. A little over a year ago, like, we used to keep track of, like, exchanges that had USDC and then that also had local currency. So effectively, you could get from USDC into, like, you know, whatever brazilian real or whatever it was. And, like, just in the last year, that's exploded right there. Like, exchanges that offer services to people in 200 countries where those exchanges have USDC support and they have local currency connectivity in, like, almost 30 different currencies now. But what does that mean? It means, like, there's basically, like, a settlement path to get from dollars to these, you know, to local bank accounts and local currencies in all these places.
00:50:46.656 - 00:51:20.834, Speaker A: That just happens organically. Like, we didn't go do deals with anyone. It's just like, people connect to it. And I think that's just the start, right? There's been more and more and more of that, and then people build abstractions on top of that and be like, oh, wow, I can get funds to an indian bank account in, like, three minutes, or whatever. That is super cheap with almost no effects. And by using these kinds of settlement paths. So I think there's a lot of more work that will come to make to build on all that.
00:51:21.694 - 00:51:42.022, Speaker C: I mean, to me, it seems, like obvious that any system today that's using USDC, that's SkyC. Once merchants start accepting that as credit cards, they can issue the. They can send the USDC they have on credit for the user and then deal with, like, settling with the user later.
00:51:42.078 - 00:51:42.270, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:42.302 - 00:51:43.686, Speaker C: At some interest rate.
00:51:43.870 - 00:51:44.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:44.294 - 00:51:45.766, Speaker C: Like, all of a sudden you have.
00:51:45.790 - 00:51:50.804, Speaker A: Like a, yeah, that can happen pretty. Yeah, that definitely can happen.
00:51:51.584 - 00:52:05.924, Speaker C: Yeah, that's super cool. Like, it seems like I wouldn't be surprised if, like, the entrenched, like, visas of the world get blindsided by this much faster than they think.
00:52:07.424 - 00:52:38.592, Speaker A: I mean, this is the thing, like, the whole, the whole beauty of all this is this is the open Internet. This is public protocols. This is developer innovation. This is happening, you know, with, with people who are creating and building on this as open, as open technology. And like, it has multiplier effects, it has compounding effects, it has all these network effects. And there's so much, so many degrees of freedom for people to build that things. When you see all that kind of happening together, like, things can happen really fast.
00:52:38.592 - 00:53:05.394, Speaker A: Things can actually happen. I realize, like, it feels glacial sometimes, but like, you know, things start to happen and people like, are like, where did that come from? I think right now banks and financial institutions are looking at things like USDC and they're going to, where the fuck did this come from? I thought this was just this toy thing that was over here, but I think people are waking up that this is here to stay.
00:53:06.454 - 00:53:17.106, Speaker C: In your mind, is decentralization a critical component of this? Like some, some fundamental. Does the network that it's running absolutely have to be decentralized?
00:53:17.290 - 00:53:51.376, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, I think it's sort of like, is decentralization important to the Internet? Like, it is the essence of the Internet, right? The IP, like, is a decentralized, I mean, ip, right. It is the essence of it. And it has to be that way. It has to be resilient from any control, from any corporation, any government. It needs to have that level of decentralization for it to be broadly useful to humanity. So I view it as deeply foundational.
00:53:51.376 - 00:54:34.344, Speaker A: Like, if the underlying infrastructure isn't decentralized, then we're not making progress. And then there's obviously apps and services and other things on top of that are going to be on a spectrum of decentralization. But the underlying protocols, like Solana as an example, right? You guys are making great progress in building decentralization on your network, and I think your architecture is designed to ultimately achieve a great deal of decentralization based on HPC and bandwidth adoption. That's critical. It's just really, really critical.
00:54:35.804 - 00:54:47.864, Speaker C: That's great to hear because, you know, we're like deep, deep in the trenches, you know, like connecting Ethernet cables. Sometimes you got to understand, like, is there a point to all of it?
00:54:48.204 - 00:55:11.960, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, one of the one. I know we're going to wrap up here in a minute, but like, one of the. One of the things that, that Dante, who Dante disparted, just joined circle as chief strategy officer and head of global policy, and he's amazing. You should chat with him sometime.
00:55:11.960 - 00:55:59.638, Speaker A: But he and I have been talking about, really, it's time to educate government leaders around the world that actually decentralized blockchains are strategic. They're strategic even from a national security perspective. This is really critical. For this to be decentralized, you need infrastructure that's resilient from nation state attack vectors. That is something that is not controllable. In many ways, that's actually beneficial even at that level. And, I mean, we could go long on that topic, but, yeah, I mean.
00:55:59.726 - 00:56:10.582, Speaker C: If you have, like, cryptography and fault tolerance and censorship resistance and your financial systems run runs on top of that, you can't. It's really hard to hack all of that.
00:56:10.598 - 00:56:47.034, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah, we're dealing with the legacy record keeping infrastructure and fiduciary infrastructure and so on. It's. Yeah, there's security around it, but it's got so many flaws in it and flaws that really affect society and fundamental civil rights and other things. There's just so much there. So there's a lot of work to do. But I'm cautiously optimistic, as I always am, about bringing along policymakers to actually realize this is ultimately just a better world that we're building.
00:56:48.414 - 00:57:12.778, Speaker C: On that note, like, it's really awesome to have you. Like to join us to chat. I hope the folks listening to this are inspired. Like, go build the next corporate structure. Like, smart contract engine. That would be awesome. So, yeah, if you're building stuff that has to do with USDC, you have your own ideas for, like, a non token, like, equity startup.
00:57:12.778 - 00:57:14.490, Speaker C: Like, just reach out to us.
00:57:14.642 - 00:57:23.346, Speaker A: Yeah, reach out to circle, too. We'll support you. Absolutely. Cool. All right, great to hang out. Great to chat.
00:57:23.450 - 00:57:48.208, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Jeremy. I think with that, you can also submit that project to the hackathon. Jeremy is one of the leading judges, so we can definitely fast track there and make sure you get some initial funding. I think real quick for everyone watching, because this worked really well yesterday, we dropped Jeremy's Twitter link in here. Everyone go follow him and post a screenshot of Twitter. And then we'll give, like, one or two t shirts away to some folks. So he needs to get 200 some followers or else no one's getting all.
00:57:48.216 - 00:57:50.044, Speaker A: Right, I need it. I need it.
00:57:51.704 - 00:57:53.048, Speaker B: But thanks for joining us, Jeremy.
00:57:53.096 - 00:57:54.432, Speaker A: This was awesome.
00:57:54.488 - 00:57:56.440, Speaker B: We appreciate you taking the time, and thanks.
00:57:56.472 - 00:57:57.024, Speaker A: Yeah, you're welcome.
00:57:57.064 - 00:57:59.324, Speaker B: Thanks for watching. Cheers.
