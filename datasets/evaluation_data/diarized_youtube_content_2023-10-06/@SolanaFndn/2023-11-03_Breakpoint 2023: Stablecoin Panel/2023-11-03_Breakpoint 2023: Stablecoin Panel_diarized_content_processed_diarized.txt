00:00:04.920 - 00:00:49.774, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Many of you have seen me today and this week already. I'm Anna. I'm a stablecoin maxi at Solana foundation and these are the people I work with. So it is my pleasure to introduce Alex, who is the founder of Stablecorp, really much the only functional and the best canadian stablecoin multi chain. And also on Solana live this year, my friend Alexander, founder of VNX, issuer of tokenized issuer of euro Dollar, euro stablecoin, swiss franc Stablecoin, as well as tokenized gold and maybe many other precious metals to come. He showed me pictures of vaults in Liechtenstein.
00:00:49.774 - 00:01:39.900, Speaker A: There are a lot of gold bars there. And then there's Kento, who's a founder of UXD, a really innovative stablecoin on Solana, not backed by traditionally, as those stablecoins are, but an interested in design that I'll let him share more about in a second. And then there's USO from membrane finance, which is our first euro stablecoin. And I'm really excited to say we were just checking like Etherscan and Solscan earlier, that we have more holders of euro stablecoins on Solana than Ethereum for EURC and euro etcetera almost combined. So we're close to 3400 holders there and it's off to a great start. So with that, I'll let you guys maybe introduce a little bit about the mechanisms of your stablecoins. And then we can.
00:01:39.900 - 00:02:03.250, Speaker A: The panel is very open to being interactive. Feel free to raise your hands. But roughly it's going to be about how can we make all of these different stable coins work together. Complementary. I don't think it's a zero sum game. I think it's like running the pie together. And then the second part will be talking about the different use cases, some tips, and some of our hopes for builders here.
00:02:03.250 - 00:02:12.234, Speaker A: And the last part will be for regulatory. Back to the previous panel of what will regulation look like? So yeah, with that, would you like to start?
00:02:12.314 - 00:02:32.520, Speaker B: Amazing. Yes. Thanks so much for having us. Thanks for moderating all this fun stuff. And I like the way you described it as these are the people that I work with. The way that the global stablecoin game gets won is all of us creating fabric together where our coins are interoperable. We're all in the same networks, we all have the same payment rails, we all have the same regulatory environments.
00:02:32.520 - 00:03:13.804, Speaker B: So somebody's tokenized security is not somebody else's e money. So QCAd, specifically the digital dollar that we issue out of Canada, is fully fiat reserved. It's as boring as it comes, which is kind of where the world and the market is today. There's a ton of really innovative, interesting potential other ways to grow and scale the stablecoin market, but in sort of the other, the global standard of fiat backed, whereas as vanillas it comes. And I think we focus a lot on, again, that currency interoperability. So on chain, FX, push to cards, ATM machines, being able to convert to cash. So all those things that make it really, really usable and really, really spendable, not just in Canada, but around the world as well.
00:03:14.744 - 00:03:53.334, Speaker C: Hello, my name is Alexander, I'm the founder of VNX. VNX is a stable coin issue, a generator based in Liechtenstein. We actually have two platforms, one in Liechtenstein, one in Luxembourg. We're regulated in respective countries, and we're issuing euro stablecoin, swiss franc and gold. So pretty similar in that sense to Paxos, but regulated in Europe. And the focus for us, we are pretty fresh on this market from this year onwards. We're coming on Solana in literally weeks.
00:03:53.334 - 00:04:13.414, Speaker C: The token contract's been deployed, but the launch will be in a few weeks. And we're looking forward to work with the community to create use cases, especially for the institution interacting with the retail. And hopefully we will be a big help to the Solana community.
00:04:14.934 - 00:04:39.394, Speaker D: Hi, my name is Kento Inami. I'm the founder of UXD Protocol. UXD protocol is a decentralized stablecoin that's pegged to the US dollar. We've been out for quite a long time, at least in terms of Solana years. So I started working on this project since 2021. We launched in early 2022. And yeah, it's been live for now 18 months.
00:04:39.394 - 00:05:07.794, Speaker D: And basically the difference between decentralized stable coins and centralized stable coins is obviously that it's decentralized. And how we do it is that basically we have a governance token, and governance token holders can vote on, can make proposals and vote on these proposals to make changes to the stablecoin and to kind of make the stablecoin better. I'll probably talk more in detail about the stablecoin later, but yeah, that's the rough explanation for UXD.
00:05:08.554 - 00:05:35.494, Speaker E: Yeah. I'm Josa, head of product and growth at Membrane Finance. We are building a euro stablecoin that's currently issued on five chains. We're also coming to a few others this year and our focus is on trying to be as boring as possible. So we try to do things as far as we can by the book. So we are regulated as an electronic money institution in Finland. Our license has been passported to all EU and EEA countries and to my knowledge we're the only MECA compatible EU based stablecoin at the moment.
00:05:35.494 - 00:06:05.184, Speaker E: So our angle is really much on ensuring that we have good banking connectivity, we have a good record status, our token or euro can be considered in accounting and taxation, etcetera purposes as nearly as cash can be, so that the enterprise movement from the current old school banking system to blockchain based financial systems can happen in a more easier way. We also provide some APIs for interoperability. That's kind of our focus, trying to be as boring as possible.
00:06:05.684 - 00:06:06.424, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:06:07.044 - 00:06:26.500, Speaker A: So I talked a bit about the history of money on Tuesday, but I think money can exist in many different shapes and forms. I have my own views, but curious to hear what you guys think. How will your stablecoin exist alongside other forms of money in no particular order and we can have a look?
00:06:26.572 - 00:07:29.166, Speaker B: It's a great question. I think it leads a little bit into the CBDC versus what a digital fiat is existing. What is paying PayPal, setting aside py USD? What is wise really doing with a digital version of money? And in many ways this is an open source way of filling in digitization on top of a banking system that can no longer innovate or improve itself. Y is a great example of a whole bunch of currencies that sit in accounts in different countries and never move, but they have this closed loop system that sits on top and just moves credits around, but you can never leave that closed loop world. Stablecoins are not that dissimilar, where the fiat reserves sit in different countries and never move. But we've created this open source, incredibly interactive, open world ecosystem of the actual tokens that can trade on dexs that can go in a million different ways that something like a wise cannot. So I think it's really an expansion and an evolution of that form of money that we have right now where tradfi sort of run out of ways to innovate.
00:07:29.166 - 00:07:33.872, Speaker B: We're just in v zero, one of the ways that we can innovate with digital money.
00:07:34.038 - 00:07:41.944, Speaker A: I feel like Troudfi is innovating like the way we try to innovate on text messages and phone calls, and then now we're building like telegram.
00:07:43.524 - 00:08:30.824, Speaker C: But also, of course, an important aspect is transfers between different countries or transfers between people, especially here in Europe, not many people remember before euro, but if you try to transfer between swiss franc and euro, or euro and british pound the fees are two, 3%. If you try to send money to, for example, Dubai, especially in euro, it could be even higher. But with stablecoins, it's 0.0, especially if you go through Defi. So I think it's a very, very important factor of getting the friction out of the payments, be it cross border payments, peer to peer payments. So yes, I think we are very, very complementary, but at the same time smoothing the system.
00:08:32.144 - 00:09:19.368, Speaker D: Yeah. I also think that stablecoins will coexist with the digital financial structure. For example, for payments. For example, an easy way to use stablecoins for payments is through actually credit cards or debit cards, where you hold your stablecoin in your wallet or some custodial account, and then when you spend with a debit card, it deducts the stablecoin from your account. There's these crypto credit companies that, where you put your USDC in, you earn yield on it during the time it stays there. So you kind of see this connection between tradfi and crypto already. And it's really helpful for people like me because I travel a lot and it's kind of difficult for me to get bank accounts.
00:09:19.368 - 00:09:26.044, Speaker D: So this kind of system really helps me make payments. So I think it's. You kind of see this connection.
00:09:26.624 - 00:09:54.550, Speaker E: Yeah. When I think about stable coins, I think about the feature sets of different types of money. So broadly, we have cash, which is a central bank issued money, we have bank deposits, then we have various forms of cards. Now we have stable coins. And then we also have this extension of CBDCs, which from a european perspective is going to be a digital version of cash. So there will be held limits, it will not be programmable, etcetera. So when you think about the features of these different currencies, cash is peer to peer, right? None of the others are, except for stable coins, they are peer to peer.
00:09:54.550 - 00:10:24.606, Speaker E: None of those are programmable. They are all in their own closed system loop ecosystems. For example, a european CPDC will be a closed system. Cash cannot really be programmed, truly. There are vending machines where you can use it, sure. But stablecoins provide a new feature set that has not been available previously, which is programming. So when you can pair Internet age with blockchain and make programmable transactions, there's a lot of new use cases that emerge, for example, in invoicing for smart city interactions, or AI data loads in.
00:10:24.606 - 00:10:32.886, Speaker E: It just opens up a new way of monetizing businesses, and henceforth also a new venue for businesses to innovate and operate in.
00:10:33.070 - 00:11:08.470, Speaker B: Can I just make one more quick point. We tried unbundling banks like ten or 15 years ago, and I feel like that was sort of the dawn of the fintech, maybe like closer to 20 years ago at this point. And eventually banks just sort of ended up slowly gobbling things back up, or like banks ended up doing 90% of the work. This really is an opportunity to actually unbundle payments from banks for the first time since we had scrip or when cash was kind of actually king. So it will work. Inconsistent. Banks will always have a place in the value stack, but it's one of the first times we've actually had an opportunity to truly unbundle, which is really cool.
00:11:08.662 - 00:12:05.034, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I guess throwing out a wild idea here is that we're kind of building out stable coins on top of another layer of banking infrastructure. And unless right now you're a CBDC or central banks working on digital currencies or some other oftentimes like government related institution or agency, it's very hard. It is right now, unless you want to store a bunch of cash in a vault, impossible to separate ourselves from the banking ecosystem banking system. So I wonder if in the future, like UXD or some other iterations of stablecoins, we'll come up with ways to be fully, not just another layer on top of the banking system, but fully separated, actually. Side note, some stablecoin issuer back in the like two cycles ago, legit had vaults and vaults of cash, and that was their way of issuing stable coins. I don't think people will do that anymore, but just something interesting in the past of crypto history.
00:12:05.034 - 00:12:27.958, Speaker A: So my next question is, how do you guys think the licensed compliant stablecoins, like the three of you here, would interact with the uxds of the world? I was half expecting you guys to get in a debate of what stablecoins would be on the backstage, but everyone's very friendly, so I think we kind of have this conversation here.
00:12:28.126 - 00:12:32.382, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I always think about it sort of in terms of evolution and development.
00:12:32.478 - 00:12:32.686, Speaker E: Right.
00:12:32.710 - 00:13:17.646, Speaker B: Like, I think we've both said a couple times that, like, fiat backed stable coins are boring and sort of designed to be boring. Right. They're designed to take a lot of the risk out and just extend the technology of, you know, a framework that we already have today of moving money around, having digital dollars, blah, blah, blah. And that's sort of like, you know, that's theoretically ready to scale today. You know, the regulations have started to catch up there. Like, we're pretty confident on what we need to do to like, you know, create stability. Obviously, you know, it's still deep pegs every once in a while with USDC and non fiat backed, whether it's algorithmic, decentralized, all of those things, they're ready to scale for different use cases, and they're just a different, I won't even call it a different stage of evolution, but a different stage of sort of experimentation.
00:13:17.646 - 00:13:42.102, Speaker B: And there's way more upside in a lot of ways from those types of models. I mean, if you think about gold backed fiat to un gold backed fiat, it's kind of, you know, there's a big step of efficiency when we sort of got rid of the gold peg. And that's almost like what we're trying to look at here is, what are the other models that can unbundle it even further from banking? So I don't think they're competitive. I think they're sort of at different stages of the product evolution and made for different things.
00:13:42.238 - 00:14:21.244, Speaker E: I absolutely agree with that. There's also different features that are available in some of these assets. So, for example, in Europe with marketing group, does regulation, a stablecoin cannot pay out interest, whereas this might be possible within a DeFi stablecoin. And for those more advanced use, defi based stablecoins can then provide a feature set that is not available in the traditional stablecoin space. And these features, while they are available for advanced users and they may be a bit more prone to risks, for example, they're available, and that availability is super important. And it's good that we have these alternatives, even though they might not be serving the same kind of user base or use cases.
00:14:22.904 - 00:15:14.954, Speaker C: Just to come back on your previous point about how it can interact with the dollars and with the banks, we are actually one of the few players who do issue stable coins backed by precious metals. And precious metals are held in the vaults, but they're not within the banking system. And what we see is that there is a specific interest from asset managers or trusts and foundations especially, that have gone through many, many years of holding the assets or caring for the assets, who do want to have a certain proportion of their assets outside of the banking sector. And that, I think, is one of the possibilities to look at it, that there will be different stable coins. Of course, the majority, this is my assumption, would be connected to the reserves which are held in the traditional financial institutions. But yes, there will be some demand for the assets which are held outside.
00:15:16.734 - 00:15:51.424, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, not much to add, but, you know, so I work on a decentralized stablecoin. And obviously, even decentralized stable coins are not above the law. Right. There's these things that you should almost never do, and then the things that you can do, and it's very difficult. Centralized stablecoins are the things that I think most decentralized stablecoins tries to do. And we also try to take that approach. But also, at the same time, we are very careful, especially regarding us regulations, because I think that's the most risky area, that we just don't want to take risks.
00:15:52.364 - 00:16:09.922, Speaker B: And you could argue that a fiat backed stablecoin that's actually backed 100% with treasury bills is kind of outside the banking system already. I mean, tether is up to 80% of treasury bills, and it's not sort of tethered to that or tethered shackled to that banking system as well.
00:16:10.058 - 00:16:31.804, Speaker E: Yeah, I think one of the original questions was how we interact with decentralized stable coins. For us, as a regular entity, that's super hard, unfortunately. So we cannot really do anything with the secular markets. We only mean to redeem euro. So for the, for us, the interaction is like, it's not there. And that's why they are secondary markets. That's why they are people with their own incentive structures.
00:16:31.804 - 00:16:49.708, Speaker E: And these are still applications that DeFi protocols can build in terms of yield, farming, whatever. These are applications that are being built in DeFi and not so much in the traditional finance space. So there's definitely a lot of use cases there that we cannot really touch, but are still being expanded and built upon by decentralized stablecoin alternatives.
00:16:49.756 - 00:16:54.942, Speaker B: And that's a great point on DeFi as well. That's sort of the great connecting agent.
00:16:54.998 - 00:16:55.238, Speaker C: Right?
00:16:55.286 - 00:17:04.158, Speaker B: Like a regulated stablecoin. And an unregulated stablecoin can trade basically atomically for almost zero. And you can build that into the back end of payment structures.
00:17:04.206 - 00:17:04.366, Speaker E: Right.
00:17:04.390 - 00:17:12.714, Speaker B: Like, you want to do a regulated payment, go nuts. You want to earn yields. We're all within the same framework. You can swap back and forth between these different kind of structures that offer different things.
00:17:13.534 - 00:17:53.678, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if anything, the interaction lies in the fiat on offering side. At least that's the minimal that you can compliantly interact with. But another thing is that even stiff coin issuers between each other have been building relationships at breakpoint, learning how to use the other issuers banking networks to maximize their on off ramp regions. So that, for example, Stablecorp has banking relationships in Canada, and then Alexander has banking relationships in Europe. And now you can actually on off ramp in both of these places, if both stable coins are on Solana. So that's a really cool one of the use cases. Next.
00:17:53.678 - 00:18:26.400, Speaker A: I think everyone here, if you've touched Solana, Defi have asked this question or wondered how can we bootstrap liquidity? So what are. I was wondering, what are any examples that we can study from history to even like, figure out if there are things we can learn from, such as when Europe, the EU went from individual currencies to the euro, if you guys want to comment on that, or just like how in web3, you've seen stablecoins been able to bootstrap that equity.
00:18:26.432 - 00:18:53.224, Speaker E: Yeah, I think there's a perfect example. When the european area came together for their own currency, they had to build a lot of trust. There was a new currency, nobody knew what it was. They had to embark on a mission of building trust. And that's still definitely the case for especially fiat backed stablecoins. Not so much for decentralized stablecoins, because taken show the reserves on chain, that's a different process. But for centralized stablecoins, building trust, ensuring that trust factor is there, getting that right is super important.
00:18:53.224 - 00:19:18.326, Speaker E: That's one of the primary drivers for our focus on regulatory compliance. And by that compliance and that kind of stamp of approval from your national competent authority, there's a certain level of trust in. Granted that, and that's super important. Otherwise, of course, secular market peg. So ensuring that €1 is always €1, that's extremely important. But unfortunately, as we come to the regulatory side of things, that's. I think that's much harder for us.
00:19:18.326 - 00:19:36.794, Speaker E: So we cannot ourselves really influence the secondary markets. We do have a minting and redemption mechanism that allows you to basically move any amount of liquidity from the traditional finance system to the blockchain and vice versa. And we hope that can bring some trust elements into the game. But for decentralized stables, I think the conversation might be slightly different.
00:19:37.494 - 00:19:48.634, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, as you said, for decentralized stablecoins, at least the safety can be kind of verified. If it's open source, you can check and you can see that the collateral is in there. So, yeah, it's a little bit different, I guess.
00:19:51.814 - 00:20:33.814, Speaker C: Go ahead. I think for us, the key driver has been adoption of Mikael. So suddenly, European Union. That has been lagging in the blockchain development for the last four years or five years. Whenever I used to come to the conference and explain what we're doing, when everyone was like, yeah, come on, who's interested in it suddenly we became like one of the hottest people to speak to. So I think this has for sure pushed european blockchain and crypto industry to the center of the global kind of crypto and blockchain industry. Again, we're quite new.
00:20:33.814 - 00:21:22.314, Speaker C: Therefore, I think the key is to grab as much space as it is possible with real use cases, which are payments, which are transfers between different countries. So something where people can really feel that they are gaining. They're gaining in terms of saving their money from inflation. If these are people in the countries with weak financial systems, either they gaining on the fees by transferring the money. So this, I think, is the key for us to develop. We really hope to bring these use cases to utilize the Solana blockchain network to spread those cases across the globe. But I think eventually this foundational layer of mica would be really helping all of us in order to bring this into the proper way forward.
00:21:22.934 - 00:21:58.148, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think we all agree that stablecoins are going to be a lot larger in five years from now than they are today. And I think we've had this concept of on chain FX, everybody's like, oh, no brainer. Such a terrible world to send money around right now. It costs me a ton when I tap my credit card in a different country. There's so many things that just sort of make so much sense around this, but why hasn't it happened yet? And non USD stablecoins represent like 0.1% of the market cap and 0% of the volume. And just being transparent about where we are in the scale of all of this.
00:21:58.148 - 00:23:24.236, Speaker B: And what's really interesting about sort of the, from here to then and back to the euro example, we're not creating a new currency here, right? All you really need to get liquidity into a non USD coin is one or two players that really trust it. And with new concentrated liquidity mechanics and things like that, and for the size of payments that are generally going around, I mean, with 100k on orca or Uniswap v. Three, sorry, dirty word around here, but that you can do five k of USD to QCaD for like five basis points in slippage. Like, you do not need a ton of liquidity to create the ability to do transactions at a price point that is 90% to 95% less expensive than tradfi. And you only need a couple of global institutions to really buy that. Okay, not everybody may know a smaller issuer, but if a Cumberland or our friends DV in the audience here, if there's a large market maker that has that faith that they can go one for one, the liquidity can grow into something that's really substantial and meaningful basically overnight. Just to piggyback on Alexander's point, it's really that last mile where, sure, I can swap between these two digital versions of assets for two basis points, but when I'm traveling in the US still, like when I'm buying Arby's or whatever on a road trip, I'm still paying four or 5% on my Mastercard.
00:23:24.236 - 00:23:45.584, Speaker B: So it's that last mile of figuring out whether it's card pushes ATM's, all of those things. And you don't necessarily need to build a ton of trust around the asset itself. If you have the right partners, the right phenomenal infrastructure, like what Solana can bring to the table, and then that last mile, you can almost bury that and just focus on the cost savings. And I think that's really what's going to win this game.
00:23:46.404 - 00:24:23.376, Speaker A: In the interest of time, I'm curious anyone here who's looking for ideas to build, then we can dive into that. Otherwise we can jump into some other use cases. If you're looking for use cases, raise your hand. All right. Okay. Then we can talk a little bit about, I was thinking, because each one of you have kind of told me one or two pretty interesting use cases, and maybe unique to your deal pipeline or relationships, if you're willing to share some, it'd be great to hear from you. What is the most interesting use case you've seen so far?
00:24:23.520 - 00:24:24.104, Speaker C: Yes.
00:24:24.224 - 00:25:41.940, Speaker B: So we care about two kind of key things, and students and international students moving around are sort of a key target market of ours. So what we've built, we actually have a credit card integration in Canada. So you can go from Orca, like USDC to QCAD for five basis points, and then zero cost from a non custodial wallet, right, to a spendable card that shows up on your Apple Pay. And so being able to have university students who are, you know, have, have their general money in a different part of the world, but are studying and spending and kind of living temporarily in Canada, that's a huge use case for us, because none of them are large enough to really be getting, like, institutional rates, and they're sending money frequently in small chunks, and they're generally younger and more tech savvy and able to sort of go through this process. So spending, like actual spendable cash. The other thing that we pay a lot of attention to or prioritize is being able to pay tuition directly from stablecoins so we built an integration with bill pay in Canada so you can pay tuition, you can pay your visa bill, you can pay property taxes, all without needing to have that interim hop of off ramping into your own bank account. Effectively, it's a checking account that you can initiate everything from digital assets and then have that fiat settle into the last mile of where you want it without needing to have that banking layer.
00:25:41.940 - 00:25:47.944, Speaker B: So a lot of that has a lot of applicability broadly. But students is a big place that we focus on.
00:25:48.364 - 00:26:40.744, Speaker C: What we saw is a difficulty of young companies, especially from the blockchain and crypto to open bank accounts. Basically, banks in Europe are reluctant to deal with small companies where they don't see a lot of fees and see a lot of hassle, especially if these companies come from blockchain and crypto. So we tried to address it. And the trade companies and trade registry in Liechtenstein recently approved payment of the capital, initial capital for company formation in Vnex stablecoins. So the next Eurovnx CHF can be used in order to set up companies. And I think this is one of the very clear advantages for the companies when they are coming to be. That's all.
00:26:41.604 - 00:27:27.130, Speaker D: So I think so far, stablecoins have mostly been used as collateral to trade derivatives on sexes and then to earn yield in Defi. So I think these two have been the main use cases for stablecoins. But what they are is kind of like speculation kind of based activities. And I think the next big thing that will bring people outside of crypto into crypto and use stable coins is actual real use cases like payments, payrolls in streaming, which don't have a speculative element, but people just want to use it to do their everyday things. So I think that will make the market much bigger. So that's what I'm excited for.
00:27:27.132 - 00:27:59.644, Speaker E: For stablecoins, I'm going to mention just a few very short use cases. So these are around the stuff that is not possible with the current banking system. So one of the use cases that we have implemented in smart city applications, for example, so whenever you take your electric vehicle, you drive it, you park it, you can just walk out, it automatically charges for every second that you park on the parking spot and for every kilowatt that you charge your car. No need for anything else. Your car has its own wallet, automatically pays the system, stuff like that. Not possible in traditional finance, only possible in Solana.
00:27:59.804 - 00:28:44.136, Speaker B: Can I add one more awesome short term financing buy now, pay later supply chain finance, even if they have t plus one settlement and there's no international money movement required. Just adding in an additional day of interest earning when the total length of your loan is like eight days or something like that is a huge interest savings for a lot of these companies that are operating in that structure. So we built basically an API where you can have fiat live entirely around the edge and then create entirely stablecoin based structures of commerce in the middle, like instant credit granting, instant transaction, instant settlement, instant loan fulfillment, and just have that interest calculation happen at the second that it needs to happen and stuff like that. Again, to your point, is just things you cannot do with the traditional banking system today.
00:28:44.220 - 00:28:51.284, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. All right, last question. Rapid fire. What do you think your stablecoin should be called, and who do you think should regulate it?
00:28:51.824 - 00:28:52.408, Speaker C: Sorry?
00:28:52.496 - 00:28:57.604, Speaker A: What do you think your token or stablecoin or emoney or whatever it should be called and who should regulate it?
00:28:59.664 - 00:29:01.592, Speaker B: A digital dollar and the bank of.
00:29:01.608 - 00:29:08.896, Speaker C: Canada, VNX, Euro VNX, swiss franc, and respective countries where it's regulated it should.
00:29:08.920 - 00:29:10.368, Speaker D: Be held, is the question.
00:29:10.456 - 00:29:12.960, Speaker A: Should it be called a stablecoin or a stable token?
00:29:13.032 - 00:29:15.364, Speaker D: Oh, yes, stablecoin.
00:29:16.384 - 00:29:17.724, Speaker E: Stablecoin is fine.
00:29:18.104 - 00:29:20.144, Speaker A: Sounds good. All right, thank you guys for coming.
