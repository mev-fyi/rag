00:00:00.320 - 00:00:29.161, Speaker A: Chris, what are you building? We are from Bonnie. And we are building a global, decentralized data network. Our personal information is collected, bought, sold every day. And we find that unfair. So we think we should fairly reward it for contributing our data. And that's why we invented Boni. With Boni, you can upload everyday receipts and purchases and bills offline or online, share them with us, and you get tokens from us from that, so you can earn with your data.
00:00:29.161 - 00:00:41.465, Speaker A: Super cool. How can people get started? People get started just by downloading our app, Bonnie. So you can download it and connect your wallet or just with your email and then you can start taking pictures of the receipts or uploading them.
