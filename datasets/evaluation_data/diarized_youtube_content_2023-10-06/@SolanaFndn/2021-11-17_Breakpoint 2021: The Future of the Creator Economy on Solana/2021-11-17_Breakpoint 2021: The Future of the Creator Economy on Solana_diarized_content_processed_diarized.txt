00:00:10.760 - 00:00:46.794, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks everyone. It's great to be here. I've been building consumer applications for over 20 years, and I can't say that I've ever been as excited as I am now in what we are going to see unleashed over the next five years. Because over the next five years, what we're going to see is an explosion of creativity. And we believe that's going to be powered by Solana combines the three things that consumers need, which is it's fast, it's cheap, and with applications like Phantom, it's highly intuitive. This is nothing like we've seen with crypto before.
00:00:46.794 - 00:01:31.852, Speaker A: An example that I can give where I'm seeing this is I actually have a 14 year old son. He loves Valorant. He collects Pokemon cards and he spends his life on discord. He also trades samo coin with his friends. That may be unusual activity, given his dad is an entrepreneur. But the interesting thing is he doesn't have a bank account, he doesn't have PayPal, he doesn't have Venmo, but he can send money to anyone in the world instantly and almost for free. So we believe that this is going to be a really exciting next joint because its consumers are coming on board and thats what weve seen in crypto this year.
00:01:31.852 - 00:02:13.894, Speaker A: And its going to be consumer adoption thats going to drive crypto, not defi, not banking, not these other applications. We will get to those, but its going to be driven by consumer. The thing thats going to drive consumer are creators. And creators are a fascinating phenomena because over the last ten years, ill just bring up a slide, hopefully. Yes, we've seen an explosion of creators. Today, we estimate over 50 million people earn their living as creators. They're either posting videos on YouTube, they're creating music on Spotify, or they're posting pictures on Instagram.
00:02:13.894 - 00:02:57.654, Speaker A: It has been phenomenally successful, however, despite many of these creators being rich, getting rich and successful from it. If you read the news report and you talk to these creators, a lot of them are miserable, deeply miserable. The experience after that first flush of success is a treadmill. You're a slave to an algorithm. You're constantly having to produce more and more content to stay relevant. Probably one of the early examples of this, and if you recognize this picture, it's Michelle Phan. Michelle Phan started on YouTube around 2005 and over ten years built up a huge following.
00:02:57.654 - 00:03:22.486, Speaker A: Over that period, she accumulated over a billion views. She had a huge following on social media, she had contracts. She started a company called Ipsy. She was phenomenally successful she became rich. And then one day she disappeared. People genuinely thought she had died. She disappeared from social media, from posting every day.
00:03:22.486 - 00:03:52.936, Speaker A: She completely stopped. And it wasn't until two years later she posted a video about it. Basically why I left. Very emotional video, but it was a key point in it and I'd recommend everyone to watch it. Where she says, basically, once I was a girl with dreams, but then I became a product and I was just selling. Web two is very detrimental to creators. And the reason for this is that web two isn't really built for the creative process.
00:03:52.936 - 00:04:48.976, Speaker A: The creative process is not about continually pushing out content. Anyone who tries to do that, the impact is that the quality goes down and it results in creator burnout. And this is one of the reasons that we've seen such excitement about nfts, because nfts do fit with the creator process. Nfts allow you to reflect, spend time, think about what you're going to build and then deliver it. And then after you've done that, you can rest, you can reflect on the next project. And that's why we've seen this incredible explosion of nfts and incredible interest from creators and we've seen that reflected in the numbers. If we just look at opensees numbers from tiny beginnings at the start of this year, they're now doing a billion dollars per month in ethereum sales only.
00:04:48.976 - 00:05:24.314, Speaker A: So this doesn't include any other l two s, and it certainly doesn't include other l one s. Like Solana, we estimate there's over 4 billion in sales every month in nfts. And the great thing here is that 90% to 95% of that value is going straight back to creators. So this is a phenomenal technology, but it gets better. In crypto, we always say, hey, it's early, but we have no idea how early this is. I just want to give you an example. If we look at Maus, here's YouTube.
00:05:24.314 - 00:05:49.294, Speaker A: About 3 billion people look at YouTube every month. It's like 40% of them. Global population is looking at YouTube. Instagram is about one and a half billion. TikTok is about a billion. Pinterest and Twitter are both about half billion. Where does Opensea sit relative to that? This is the biggest NFT platform by a significant margin.
00:05:49.294 - 00:06:26.810, Speaker A: 300,000. Opensea is a thousandth of the size of Twitter. It is 110 thousandth of the size of YouTube. Another way to think about that is say there's like 2000 people in this room and there's maybe another 2000 people watching it live. So about 4000 people if that was a random distribution of people who watch YouTube, of that random distribution, the average number of people who would have bought an NFT in the last month would be zero. We are really, really early. And so the opportunity here is massive.
00:06:26.810 - 00:06:51.780, Speaker A: And that opportunity has been seen by creators way beyond graphic artists. It has been seen by musicians, it's seen by writers, it's been seen by photographers across all different genres. But one of the problems is the NFT technology today is very limited. I want to give you an example of that. You may recognize this artist as Grimes. She is multi award winning. She's released five albums.
00:06:51.780 - 00:07:10.144, Speaker A: She has got millions of listeners and followers across social media. She actually did a really nice NFT release back in February. It was on Nifty Gateway. It sold about 300 copies for seven and a half, $1,000. It's a great piece of work. She's a great artist. She actually is a graphic artist as well.
00:07:10.144 - 00:07:31.564, Speaker A: How's it performed? 84% drop in value. She's not alone. Give you another example. Steve Aoki, award winning DJ, 16 million listeners on Spotify. Brilliant musician. He did a release back in March for two and a half, $1,000 for character x. It's a really cool NFT.
00:07:31.564 - 00:08:34.014, Speaker A: Seen a 60% drop in value if you can sell it, barely, I think, as one has sold in the last month. Now, these are not cash grabs. These are genuine artists trying to create something that's really cool, that they want to see, appreciate and value. So what's the problem? The problem is that these are not, this is not the medium for them. The 16 million people who follow Steve Aoki follow him for his music. The NFT technology is not built for music as it is today. And so that's why my team at vault really looked at this and said, how do we unleash the power of an NFT and bring it to these other creators? How do we get the musicians in? How do we get photographers? How do we get writers? How do we give them something that they can sell to their fans, that their fans can really own and consume and then sell at their own leisure? And that's the product that we're launching today.
00:08:34.014 - 00:09:05.634, Speaker A: So the product today is called Vault. And I'm going to give you a demo right now of it, but you can download it in the App Store and I'll give you a link at the end of this talk. So for this demonstration, I have for you to imagine that I'm actually a lead singer of a band called Pretend Walrus. It's a stretch, but you have to go with me here. Now, I'm a lead singer and I'm actually going on tour, and I want to create something that allows my fans to go with me. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a vault. So here I have.
00:09:05.634 - 00:09:27.782, Speaker A: I've actually gone to vault fan. I've connected my phantom wallet, and I'm going to click create vault. You can see this page here. This is the page where I'm actually going to create my vault. You can see I've set it up as 2021 turvault. I'm going to mint 100 keys. Okay, so those keys are the NFTs.
00:09:27.782 - 00:09:53.726, Speaker A: The content of the vault is going to be video, music, text, anything that can be digitized. But the keys to the vault are going to be fully tradable. NFTs built on Metaplex, built on the slana. I'm going to price those at $1 or, sorry, one sol dollar 50. So about $400. I think that's pretty reasonable. I plan to add content in it for the next three months.
00:09:53.726 - 00:10:16.802, Speaker A: And so I think that's a pretty good deal. And then beneath that, I've just given an explanation of all of the great content you're going to get. So that's going to take me, what, five minutes? I'm going to hit create. My vault is created. Next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to get that link and I'm going to post it to my social media. So this is what I'm posting on Instagram. This is what I'm posting on Twitter.
00:10:16.802 - 00:10:31.074, Speaker A: My fans come in and they're like, hey, you know what? Okay, so now I'm no longer the lead singer. Pretend, Wallace, I'm a fan. I live in Lisbon. I can't. They're not touring here for some reason. But I want to go with the band. I want to see them behind the scenes.
00:10:31.074 - 00:10:57.718, Speaker A: I want to hear their music. And so I'm going to buy this key. And so what do I do? Well, I hit buy vault, opens up my phantom wallet key. I approved the transaction, and now I'm one of the only 100 owners of keys to this vault. Great. So what do I do? I download the app. And you can see here in the top right hand corner is the key to this vault.
00:10:57.718 - 00:11:28.492, Speaker A: You can see some other vaults that I have access to, because this is cool. And what I do is every morning I get up, and while I can't go on tour with this band, what I can do is I can check out the scenes from last night's concert. I can check out pictures from the event. I can check out snippets of music that are happening over the next three months. That's pretty cool. What's even cooler is that it's not just musicians. These are all types of creators.
00:11:28.492 - 00:12:13.794, Speaker A: So I'm going to get up in the morning, I'm going to check out what happened last night. I'm also going to read a chapter from a book from a writer who's writing it. As I'm reading it, I'm going to check out some pictures from some great photographers that I follow on Instagram that suddenly realize that why are they giving away all their content for free when people like me would pay for it. Lastly, for NFT artists who are going, you know what, in the real world, whenever I'm doing art, I have a gallery opening. Why don't I have a gallery opening on vault? And then I can show the nfts. I could even airdrop to some of the biggest collectors, that they could come out of a sneak preview. And then when I have my sale, they already know what's coming up.
00:12:13.794 - 00:12:49.214, Speaker A: So the opportunity for vault as a primitive is something that you can use are really endless. Now, the NFTs that we're minting today are ones that we are minting. But there's no reason why we can't also work with other NFT projects to say, hey, you've got geckos or you've got monkeys. Why don't you create a vault for your community that only your community can see the content of that vault. So we're launching the product today. It's live in the App Store. If you go to vault fan first, you can register, connect your phantom wallet.
00:12:49.214 - 00:13:07.584, Speaker A: I'll actually give you a QR code as well. We can link to it. We're doing a treasure hunt. It's been inspired by ready player one. And so the basic background is we're giving away three nfts. The bottom one is a meerkat. Then there's a wave from playground and the last one is a monkey.
00:13:07.584 - 00:13:30.166, Speaker A: There will be three vaults. Vault today is already up. You can go in and find it. In it you will see a set of clues and the first person to figure out the code will win the meerkat tomorrow at 01:00 p.m. Local or 08:00 a.m. Eastern will drop the second vault. The first person to crack the code will get the wave.
00:13:30.166 - 00:13:57.344, Speaker A: And then the big prize which is on day three which is on Wednesday, is going to be the monkey. So good luck. We've had a lot of excitement already to crack this code. I actually don't know all the answers. Don't corner me for it. But I've seen some of the background of how this created, and I think as it gets more harder as we go through, so we're pretty excited to see how long it takes people to crack it. And that's it.
00:13:57.344 - 00:14:06.104, Speaker A: Here's some QR codes. If you want to just go that way in. Otherwise, just go to Vaultfatfan and you can download the app. Thank you.
