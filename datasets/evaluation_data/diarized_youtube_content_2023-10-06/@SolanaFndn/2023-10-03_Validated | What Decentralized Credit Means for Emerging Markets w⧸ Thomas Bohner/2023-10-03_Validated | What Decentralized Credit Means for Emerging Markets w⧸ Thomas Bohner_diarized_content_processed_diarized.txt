00:00:04.560 - 00:00:06.110, Speaker A: Thomas, welcome to validated.
00:00:06.302 - 00:00:12.302, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Really excited to be here. Really excited to talk about the ecosystem.
00:00:12.398 - 00:01:01.884, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a topic that we've kind of been digging into more over the last year or so of the show, which is like this new generation of Defi. Right. We had sort of the rise of initially builder DeFi on Ethereum in that sort of 2019, early 2020 timeline. We saw all this really explode in the summer of 2020 and 2021, and then there was a really big retraction in the defi market. And this is sort of typical of every bear market. But one of the things I've been really impressed in the Solana ecosystem by is how much DeFi innovation has sort of continued when really no one was paying attention to DeFi. I feel like Credx sort of fits into this story as well, where this was something that we, you guys, started talking a bit in 2021 about sort of what you were building, but it felt like most of those things were sort of still coming.
00:01:01.884 - 00:01:14.532, Speaker A: And here we are now, halfway through 2023, and we're in a really different position in Solana, Defi in general and with you guys. So I want to start out. Could you give us an overview of what Credx is and what the impetus for the protocol was?
00:01:14.668 - 00:02:17.380, Speaker B: Oh, definitely. So if you look at the core, Credix is trying to build a digital infrastructure for the private credit markets. And we specifically, we have a focus on Latin America. So often in the world of Defi, in the world of blockchain, we will be referred to as a real world asset, RWA protocol, been doing the tokenization of debt and of credit. Now, I think a few things are really interesting here, and I think what you were referring to me personally, I've been working professionally into the blockchain space for almost ten years now. And I remember eight, eight, nine years ago, there was this big promise of tokenization, and I think it really never took off, because what we tried to do is we tried to take the status quo of the financial services, put it on the blockchain, and we expected the blockchain to solve all our problems, like cut out all the middlemen. Everybody's gonna make a lot of money.
00:02:17.380 - 00:03:08.184, Speaker B: This is gonna grow. The financial services system is gonna become super efficient. And very quickly, I think everybody realized it was a lot harder than that. I think that then triggered the net new innovation, which brought the DeFi summer of 2021. Back then, I was still working in enterprise blockchain, and it was really that DeFi summer truly disrupting, rethinking how financial services work, bringing in retail, creating true efficiencies. That triggered us. And when I'm speaking, as I'm saying, me and my two co founders, to think about how can we now bridge this world of traditional tokenization and the net new innovation that is happening in DeFi that became the initial promise for critics.
00:03:08.184 - 00:03:22.144, Speaker B: Here we are now, about two years later, we are putting asset backed securities on the blockchain backed by a DeFi model. So, pretty exciting.
00:03:22.694 - 00:04:19.586, Speaker A: So there's a lot of folks who have tried to do some version of this over the history of DeFi. And honestly, this isn't entirely new to DeFi. We saw a lot of this type of work in the fintech boom of problem that a lot of folks ran into, especially back then, was that the taking of these types of assets, the basically bridging from what can be described as a programmatic asset model, which is something like Robinhood's very programmatic, right. You tie into the stock brokerages and you have an instant access, and it's basically just API calls. At the end of the day, it's a gross oversimplification of that market. But at the end of the day, it's either API calls or in the case of like an amm on chain or something like openbook, everything is on chain, and you don't have to worry about this messy world of humans. Credit markets in Latin America is exclusively the messy world of humans, and you're combining that with something like a permissionless blockchain.
00:04:19.586 - 00:04:43.814, Speaker A: So the problem with most of these things historically has been that interface point where you either run into oracle problems or you just run into logistics problems where it takes a lot of humans to process a lot of off chain paperwork. So how have you guys thought through that problem and sort of what using this type of technology on blockchain actually brings you versus going like the masterworks route or something like that?
00:04:44.674 - 00:05:21.432, Speaker B: I think we learned the hard way. Right. So I think we were very opportunistic when we got started. Like, hey, there is this high interest rate environment in Latin America, low interest rate environment in United States. We're going to bring them together on blockchain. Everybody's going to be happy and everybody's going to be investing in these kind of credits. But indeed, like you say, very quickly you realize that the biggest issue and the biggest difficulty is not creating the smart contracts and putting the business logic on chain and automating a big part of the transaction.
00:05:21.432 - 00:06:19.898, Speaker B: But it's really indeed bringing that bridge between the digital world and the off chain world. And very quickly when you talk about those kinds of things, you come in regulatory frameworks and risk management frameworks from the beginning. That is something that we said with Credx. We can not only build the protocol as a standalone, we will have to set up legal infrastructure and we will have to go through the pain of integrating that legal infrastructure with the on chain world to really make this institutional great. Because if you say to any investor, retail or institutional, I'm going to give you a ten x better experience from buying and selling these kind of credits. But in the end, you don't really have a recourse when things go into default or there has not been really any risk management underwriting being done. That technical user experience isn't worth a lot.
00:06:19.898 - 00:06:31.574, Speaker B: And so it's really by integrating good best practices from the traditional finance world for risk management and legal frameworks and bringing that into this new digital era of blockchain.
00:06:32.434 - 00:07:37.002, Speaker A: So I hear that that is something I think is a really, really true and strong point here. I know people who work in the traditional bonds market and work for some classic CFI debt consolidation type groups, and one of the things that they will say is that they don't necessarily understand why this sort of thing is better on blockchain. And to be fair, I'm not a believer that things have to be better on blockchain at the start for them to sometimes be better in the future. This is your classic David Letterman interview with Bill Gates, where he's like, well, I can listen to the radio and I can get the New York Times, why is it better coming through my computer in my living room? But walk us through a little bit about that long term future. Where do you see something like this eventually hitting escape velocity, for lack of a better term, where it's not only competing with these traditional centralized credit and debt markets, but it's actually providing either greater efficiency or something that feeds feels like net new perfect.
00:07:37.058 - 00:09:00.572, Speaker B: So I think for us, we always think about this in three different distinct phases. First of all, I think it's very important that we realize the asset class that we are tokenizing private credit and then definitely into the latin american markets, emerging markets. There is no infrastructure here today. We're really talking about people using emails, faxing, printing documents, running with the document to register it with the right authorities, and so already digitizing the data, bringing the data in a certain standard on a digital infrastructure, if it is AWS or a blockchain or whatever, already provides a tremendous amount of value. Now what we then believe is the second big phase of bringing value is integrating your settlement layer and your data processing layer. And this provides tremendous efficiency. The amount of reconciliation data breaks, errors that happen because of manual intervention, because data is processed in a silo and settlement happens on different kind of infrastructure, is tremendous in this financial services industry, definitely with private credit.
00:09:00.572 - 00:10:34.380, Speaker B: And I think one of the most beautiful examples that we always take is today, if you would do like a cross border private credit transaction every month to do a simple interest repayment, it would take you about a week at least with like six or seven parties, because everybody is running their excel. They are calculating what should be paid in interest to which investor, how the distribution should look like they're all sending it over, email to each other, comparing at the end, they agree, then they need to send the payment instructions, and then they go check like, hey, did the payment actually meet what we had in our excel? And then like, oh, there is $10 missing there, $5 missing there. And so again, they have to go through the whole process. Once you have in your smart contract, your business logic agreed once on how you're going to be processing data and you run a stablecoin or really any assets through that smart contract, there is no dispute possible in real time your settlement and your data processing happens, and that creates a tremendous amount of efficiency. And then lastly is the third phase. That's where I'm personally the most excited about, and that is truly net new innovation. I'm thinking here about building fully decentralized stablecoins that are partially backed by real world assets, something we're already doing with another protocol on Solana UXD.
00:10:34.380 - 00:11:00.430, Speaker B: We have a direct integration, fully automated, fully smart, contract driven decentralized asset liability module. But we can start thinking about secondary markets, new kind of insurance products, access for retail investors. But it starts with that digitalization of the data, then it moves into the integration with the settlements, and then we can start thinking about the net new innovation.
00:11:00.622 - 00:11:44.946, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting that .2 that you sort of brought up there around like, oh, we can build a smart contract and we flow data through the smart contract. No matter what the asset type is, it'll distribute an output in this, in this specific way. It's kind of interesting because I think a lot of people assume there is just a business logic services platform that they can build those sort of financial contracts through and that that'll just like, oh, the existing financial industry must have smart contracts for normal money contracts. And it's interesting that like one of the major unlocks in blockchain is that we've simply built a programming language that allows this stuff to be done in a way where every step of the process can be verified. And one would assume that's part of the existing financial stack.
00:11:45.090 - 00:12:18.444, Speaker B: Definitely, and we definitely see that a lot when we interact with like crypto native investors or people who have been crypto native and have been using more traditional DeFi products. For them, it's normal. Like, hey, liquidation happens automatically. Everything is transparent. You can see everything on chain. When you talk about data processing and settlement, it's almost the same for them in the conversation. But when you speak with people in traditional finance, they speak about a swift transaction that might take one day, but it also might take five days.
00:12:18.444 - 00:12:44.054, Speaker B: And if you really have a bad day, it might even still take ten sometimes. And so I think it is the lack of truly digital infrastructure and the creation of silos that we have in traditional financial worlds that put us at such an advantage here by having those indeed native financial contracts on the infrastructure.
00:12:44.174 - 00:12:58.846, Speaker A: I think that's really interesting that that is actually something that has not really been done at this point. Exactly, because we joke that every startup is just a Google sheet with a fancy front end, but it's interesting how much that is still true of the traditional financial world.
00:12:58.950 - 00:13:57.274, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And it is very true. And there is so much still to be done. If we look today, for example, at Credx, what we have been really strong at and really been focused at, is solving the problems for the investors. We have built an amazing set of smart contracts to be able to very quickly, very efficiently process massive amounts of data, do complex securitization transactions, provide everything in real time for our investors, do a cross border settlement into Brazil. But the moment the money arrives in Brazil, there still is like a traditional, traditional payment rail we have to go through. There still is like an excel to do the portfolio management, and slowly but steadily, we're digitizing all of those things, tokenizing the underlying assets, creating smart contracts to manage the portfolio covenants and eligibility criteria.
00:13:57.274 - 00:14:08.846, Speaker B: And we see that this creates excitement with the borrowers and the partners that we work with, because this is a world that they could have never imagined with the traditional tools that they have available.
00:14:09.030 - 00:14:37.034, Speaker A: Yeah, so I want to talk a little bit about those partners that you work with in Latin America. So when they come to you and say, hey, I'm doing a project, or I need a loan, or I have a credit facility, and we need to raise debt to finance whatever operations they're doing, do they know that at the end of the day, this is settling on blockchain, or at what point in the process does someone have to learn what CRedx is other than a place I can go and get money?
00:14:37.154 - 00:15:13.184, Speaker B: Yeah, today nobody really has to anymore. So we have fully abstracted away the blockchain part and the blockchain interaction. So on, ramping and off ramping can happen with direct fiat interactions. We have APIs and user interfaces to get access to the data, interact with the platform. Now, a lot of the partners that we work with in Latin America are startups or scale ups themselves. So they're often very curious to learn more and they say, hey, we want to have a wallet. We want to interact with the blockchain.
00:15:13.184 - 00:15:15.004, Speaker B: We believe this is the future.
00:15:16.264 - 00:15:19.136, Speaker A: So they can get a slightly better rate if they do it all in blockchain.
00:15:19.160 - 00:16:08.310, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly. Of course, of course. So look, we're having a lot of fun going with Trem 2d education. And you see them thinking, right, they have painful processes internally, so they start to think like, hey, why don't I put a bigger part of my business here? Because in the end, I also have financial contracts, I also have reconciliations today. So why don't I integrate even deeper with credits and start thinking about using stablecoins and smart contracts. But from an investor perspective, for example, today we have a few billion dollar asset managers that interact with our platform. They send us us dollars, everything goes automated and they see how their portfolio behaves in real time, which comes directly from the blockchain, but they wouldn't even know.
00:16:08.502 - 00:16:31.668, Speaker A: So for lack of a better term, the liquidity providing side from those who are actually saying, hey, I want somewhere to park my cash, I want to earn returns. What does that process look like? Now? Is that a very traditional sales market nowadays, where you are calling up fund managers, you're talking to them about these type of opportunities? Or is that more self service like you see in traditional crypto liquidity?
00:16:31.836 - 00:17:27.244, Speaker B: No. So today that still has a pretty bespoke approach. So we mostly have big partnerships, long term relationships with larger institutional asset managers, more traditional finance players, and some smaller boutique credit funds. So today we have a team, including myself, calling them, doing the education, showing them what brings the value. We're starting to close bigger multi million dollar, three to four year kind of deals with them, which we believe is important to anchor the platform, to create a certain trust in our underwriting and risk management capabilities before we open this up in a more democratized marketplace model, where also smaller investors and smaller ticket sizes can be accepted yeah.
00:17:27.584 - 00:17:49.968, Speaker A: When you're talking with them, what are those conversations like? I think a lot of folks at this stage are a little unsure of crypto in general, but how are they looking at something like the smart contract risk that may be associated with something in blockchain compared to the traditional risks they sort of see in going with a different company for these sort of opportunities?
00:17:50.096 - 00:18:21.236, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like we had our board meeting about a month ago and I think there, one of our board members referred to it like, you guys made your lives very difficult. Right. You first have to come in and you have to sell them credit in Latin America. Then you have to sell them the Solana, blockchain and smart contracts, and then you have to sell them the usage of stablecoins in the back. So we're selling three products really. Right. But it's because we believe in the massive opportunity in the long term, of course.
00:18:21.236 - 00:18:51.058, Speaker B: Now, how do these conversations go? It always starts with, like, what is the true credit product that we're bringing to them? What is the real world asset, the real world value that we're bringing to them that they could not really get before? And so the issue with investing in emerging countries is that there is no easy way to do it and there is no transparent way to do it, and there is a lot of fraud and uncertainty.
00:18:51.146 - 00:18:52.334, Speaker A: Sounds like crypto.
00:18:53.074 - 00:19:19.044, Speaker B: Yeah. So it starts with not talking with them about blockchain, but about the value that it brings. Hey, you will have, like, real time monitoring of your portfolio. You will have, like, instant settlement. We can provide certain liquidity tricks. We can pull certain investments to give you diversification, and that really starts triggering the interest. Then, of course, we go a bit deeper into the innovation part of things.
00:19:19.044 - 00:20:01.014, Speaker B: And I think a year ago, or maybe already a bit longer, funds were knocking on our door to learn more about real world assets and tokenization and blockchain. Today, it's a bit less, but we feel that with the real big asset managers, nothing really hasn't changed. And they're definitely less public about it. But they have teams, they are invested, they have a thesis, and they understand that if they want to scale their assets under management without the need to hire hundreds or thousands of people, they will have to start using better technology for that.
00:20:01.714 - 00:20:34.094, Speaker A: Yeah. It is interesting that in a world of historically low interest rates, I hadn't really thought of this before until you brought this up. You didn't quite say this, but in a world of low interest rates, you can deal with a lot more operational overhead than you can in a world of high interest rates, and that there's a bit of a forcing function potentially, on the adoption of blockchain technology just based on the fact that you can take your headcount and knock it down by 80% potentially, and get the same efficiencies if you adopt these kind of underlying technologies.
00:20:34.254 - 00:20:34.646, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:20:34.670 - 00:20:35.286, Speaker A: It's interesting.
00:20:35.390 - 00:21:18.714, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, I think it's very interesting. And I think we're a bit in this weird situation in the market where still some of the biggest financial institutions, they keep growing their assets under management, they keep seeing massive inflows of capital. At the same time, they're a lot more risk averse of where to put it, but also they cannot increase their headcounts to allocate it efficiently. And so they're really in this big need of partnering up with technology, native origination and asset management platforms to be able to scale their business without decreasing their margins and their profitability.
00:21:19.414 - 00:21:41.162, Speaker A: Interesting. So what are the sort of, we talked a little bit about the differences in the investor side and then also on sort of the client side over the long term, where do you see this market evolving? Do you think that like, because right now you're sort of talking about a private system on the investor side and a private system on the borrower side.
00:21:41.238 - 00:21:41.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:42.674 - 00:21:56.274, Speaker A: How kind of my favorite question to ask anyone in this new generation of DeFi, how permissionless do you think these systems can get into the future realistically, and how much of this is going to be? Someone always has to review a credit application.
00:21:56.434 - 00:22:52.794, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I think personally, look, the whole team almost, that works at Credx, we come from a background of having been crypto degens pretty early in the industry. We like the idea of decentralization and permissionless. I think the moment you start talking about credit and risk, you start to have a bit of a different view on that. You always start to have a worst case scenario approach. What if things go wrong today? That means how do you fit in with the current regulatory and legal frameworks? And so I think that will always remain at the core. Now, I think the protocols itself that we are building and the marketplaces that we're building should become as open and permissionless as possible.
00:22:52.794 - 00:23:38.220, Speaker B: Which means that within those marketplaces, there can be environments that are only allowed for certain borrowers or investors, but other people can build on top of it. Other borrowers can open their own pools. I think we can set up best practices of like, hey, how do you link the legal contract with the on chain contract? But for that a lot of work needs to be done. We need to work very closely with the regulator to move that forward. And as you know, in us currently, that's not the easiest in Brazil, where we're very active, this is going super smooth. Like, we have weekly workshops with the central bank. We're creating a tokenization group with them.
00:23:38.220 - 00:24:09.044, Speaker B: They are starting their own central bank digital currency, which they will make interoperable with Defi, they say, hey, we're just one example of a stablecoin. Everybody can have their own stablecoin. It needs to be permissionless, it needs to be interoperable. And I think that's the way that we think about it as well. We're putting assets on the Credx protocol today. We're trying to build trust and best practices. But in the long term, this should be an open, permissionless platform where anybody can build on top.
00:24:09.824 - 00:24:55.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's fascinating that Brazil, famously, their CBDC project is pretty far along. They had a pretty interesting process to go ahead and select that. I think they had Solana in the running for a little bit too, in terms of the technology they want to use. But I want to talk a little bit about, because Brazil is a very strange economy. Yes, in some ways, it's very on the administrative side, tech forward, on the actual economy side, it's not as far along as I think most people would assume it is for an economy the size of Brazil. It's also got quite protectionist policies around certain parts of its economy. Famously, it's very expensive to import computers or electronics of any sorts into Brazil.
00:24:55.290 - 00:25:01.174, Speaker A: So what made this be a market that you guys thought was a really good one to go after? First?
00:25:02.714 - 00:25:43.184, Speaker B: I think it's exactly those things. I think it is the friction that it creates between locally being a huge market, 200 million people, GDP is growing year over year. They have a pretty strong debt, capital markets, regulation. There are only a few banks that are really active who have some of the highest return on equity in the world. Still, a lot of people are unbanked. If you look at invoice, receivable financing, it is like a $2 trillion annual market. So there is a huge opportunity.
00:25:43.184 - 00:26:25.434, Speaker B: But then at the same time, indeed, the barrier to entry is super high. It's difficult to bring in foreign currency. It's difficult to do anything if you don't speak the portuguese language. The volatility is insane. Five years you're working with Bolsonaro, and now you have an earlier convicted president who's going to do who knows what. I think it is that opportunity with a high barrier to entry that felt us like, hey, if we can do it here, we can do it anywhere and we can solve for it. And there is a truly big need to bring in more capital in this market and have an impact.
00:26:25.434 - 00:27:24.184, Speaker B: And once we get this right in Brazil, it becomes almost a copy paste model into easier markets like Mexico, like Colombia, and any other emerging markets. And we believe there is a big opportunity to use blockchain and open kind of systems in local markets like the US. But there you're starting to play very quickly a pure margin play. You're trying to save ten to 20 basis points. I think here we have a bit of a more blank sheet page opportunity to truly rethink the way that these debt capital markets work. And we're talking about sometimes very bad local service providers would charge like 500, 600 basis points for managing an excel. And when you see that, you feel there is an opportunity.
00:27:24.484 - 00:28:21.178, Speaker A: Well, this is where I think this is really. I want to stay on this a little longer. Fascinating, because if you look at Brazil, it makes the US look stable. Yeah, and I don't want to get into brazilian politics because it's a whole different podcast on that. But I think one of the assumptions that a lot of folks in the United States make is they look at developing markets and they look at somewhere like Turkey and look at somewhere like Brazil and they say this is just inherently four times riskier than we would like the market to be. Before you get into the normal issues with credit facilities and debt facilities and debt financing and factoring and all that sort of work, the base level risk profile in this region seems higher than we're necessarily comfortable with. So how did both you and then the investors who are investing in you sort of get comfortable with the idea that, as you said, there's a ton of education has to go into.
00:28:21.178 - 00:28:56.022, Speaker A: Like, first off, Latin America is not the top tier market that a lot of people look for when they're looking for these sorts of things. The ideal company to lend to is like the city of New York or like Apple or one of the, you know, like a very traditional, stable enterprise. Additionally, we're talking about blockchain, whole other piece. Additionally, we're talking about, you know, a politically tumultuous country. Like, I'm really curious, like, what you guys are doing, right, that others are not doing that's making this market attractive to these kind of very traditional asset managers you're talking to.
00:28:56.118 - 00:29:57.866, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is really that, like, that risk reward opportunity and a lot of the risks that people see can be solved by certain mitigants. And like for that you need to put in the work, you need to work with local people, and you need to be open minded. But once you get there, the opportunity becomes so big to become a leading market player and lead the way. And I think that is the opportunity that a lot of people like. And for example, if we look at first the credit itself, right? Like there is a big access premium, there just is a lack of local capital. Like only 20% of the SME's and the corporates can get access to financing there today. It's not because like 80% of them are inherently all super risky.
00:29:57.866 - 00:30:05.200, Speaker B: So they are paying like a very expensive price, not necessarily as a risk premium, but really an access to capital premium.
00:30:05.322 - 00:30:05.884, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:30:05.964 - 00:30:56.978, Speaker B: And a lot of big asset managers realize that. But then they say, like, look, the hassle of like finding a local service provider, having to fly our team down there, we can only do like ticket sizes for like 200 or 300 million, right? And they do that like, Goldman is active, GP Morgan is active. They all do the big ticket sizes. But it's when you can bring in like that kind of trust by using technology, local teams, standardization, work with the local regulators, that it becomes a true opportunity. And I think the last two years, we have really, with Credx, gone through the pains of all of that, and we're now at this point where we have like a good relationship, a very strong local team, very small. They use technology for almost everything and then a digital infrastructure, and that provides significant trust to the investors.
00:30:57.106 - 00:32:03.004, Speaker A: Yeah, so I want to get into some of the work you guys are doing elsewhere in Latin America. But kind of before that, I sort of had this, like, how much do you guys consider yourselves a defi company versus how much do you consider yourselves a fintech company that's heavily leveraging blockchain? Is there a difference there? Like, because like, I think you look at something like uniswap and everyone's like, okay, pure defi or curve, right? Nothing meaningful happens off chain besides marketing. Some lawyers doing their lawyer work and software engineering and everything else is like, on chain is what matters. And Credx is one of the examples. But there's a bunch more on Solana, this sort of next gen DeFi that feels like it's very much melding that transition between what a fintech company would be doing or a traditional financial services company and defi. Where do you sort of draw that line in your mind? Like, how much of this is just sort of this is a new protocol versus, like, this is really the way DeFi 2.0 is going to be built.
00:32:03.664 - 00:33:19.366, Speaker B: I think it depends a bit on where I'm pitching this to. But no, jokes aside, I think we definitely see ourselves as like a next generation fintech company that is building on blockchain rails, on Defi rails, where I see a future for critics, that at a certain point in time, those two might split. We might have our traditional off chain fintech company doing loan originations, and we might have a protocol that lives there where other fintechs or people can build on top of. But I think also, as Defi gets integrated more and more in our day to day lives and people interact through it through centralized and traditional providers like Robinhood and PayPal, I think at a certain point in time, people are not going to care anymore. Is it like defi 1.02.0? How decentralized is it? It's really like, does it bring the value that I expect this financial product to bring for me, can I do self custody when I want to? Can I interact directly with the stablecoins? Can I trust the data that I'm seeing here? And I think we will see that emerge more and more.
00:33:19.550 - 00:33:25.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the follow up to that is, from a philosophical standpoint.
00:33:27.534 - 00:33:27.846, Speaker B: How.
00:33:27.870 - 00:34:05.818, Speaker A: Much does philosophical ideals drive what you're doing? And that sort of sounds like a leading question where it's like, are you a ruthless capitalist or are you here for the tech? Right. And that's not sort of like framing, but there is this sort of process that I think crypto is going through is, as it matures, a lot of these original principles, they're getting in the way of building real businesses. And how do you grapple with that, both personally and sort of professionally, as someone who's working in this space? But the idea of not my key is not my crypto. It applies less to this new gen of Defi than it did to bitcoin.
00:34:05.946 - 00:35:01.772, Speaker B: Definitely. Definitely. I think a few interesting things there. So I think if I look back at my personal career, like, five, six years ago, when I was building enterprise blockchain systems for, like, large stock exchanges, and, like, I was using the tech to, like, save them a few cents here and there and make them millions of dollars, it didn't really feel the right way to be using the technology. Right. I think today, on the other side, when I look back, what got me into crypto and what I got really inspired about with bitcoin, it's like, for the first time ever, we're having a global financial system that doesn't care who you are or where you are, but you can interact with it. So capital can move globally in the most efficient instant way and everybody can access it.
00:35:01.772 - 00:36:16.544, Speaker B: And if I then look at the core of what we're doing at Credx, it's like we're bringing capital into these markets that really need the capital. And we're doing that by trying, having a positive impact with a very strong ESG, financial inclusion kind of ankle. And then if I look back at it, I think like, Satoshi should be proud, right, how this technology is being used today. We're changing people's lives for the better. We can potentially, over time, truly overhaul these local banks that are making 20% return on equity, which is because you're misusing the way that you give credit to people. And so by building a more open, fair, global kind of system, I think that is the way we really think about, like, it's important to use the technology, but I think definitely there is another side to it. Like, we care indeed less about necessarily self custody, or is the custody being held by somebody else? Now, what is always important, and what I've always liked about blockchain is that you have the optionality you can provide.
00:36:16.544 - 00:36:48.236, Speaker B: Hey, KKR, Blackstone, Goldman, you want to use this, you're going to use Anchorage fire blocks. We need to do like an integration. It needs to be regulatory, safe and sound. And it's going to feel a lot less like blockchain and defi. But maybe also this other guy, retail investor, wants to use his phantom metamask wallet, connect to the platform, keep the coins himself. Like use it as collateral somewhere else in a defi platform. I think that optionality, that is super powerful.
00:36:48.420 - 00:37:07.210, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree with you there. So as you're looking at elsewhere in Latin America, you guys have been doing some work on securitization of insured loans. I want to talk a little bit about that as a product expansion and also expanding into other countries. So how has that process been? How'd that come about?
00:37:07.362 - 00:37:50.116, Speaker B: Yeah, so that started with our dipping our toes in the colombian market. So we started looking into the colombian market. Very interesting market, big opportunity. Similar problems as Brazil local banking system owns and operates everything. They're making a lot of money, so there is no drive for them to change or to do anything meaningful or to build any technology or be smart about literally anything. We got to know this company, Clave, which we're now partnering with in Colombia, and they had a very similar vision as us. But they didn't really have the blockchain tokenization cross border piece.
00:37:50.116 - 00:38:56.978, Speaker B: And when we pitched to them, it felt immediately like a match made in heaven because they were digitizing the data locally and solving a lot of the local issues, but they didn't really solve the cross border fundraising aspect of it. And so we sat around the table, we went to the drawing board and we, with critics, we told him, look, there are two things for non institutional investors that make it very difficult to get into real world assets. I think the first thing is there is a liquidity issue. They're not used to getting their money locked up for one year, two year, three year, four year, five years. They want instant or near to instant liquidity. Secondly, they are not credit experts and you cannot expect them to be. So how can we provide them a better user experience? And then we designed this new kind of product where we said like, hey, let's try to build a product where we give short term credit and we have like a fully digital integration so that every month we can allow people to get out of the protocol.
00:38:56.978 - 00:39:29.612, Speaker B: So 30 day liquidity. And then secondly, let's try to get this credit insured, move the risk away from a credit risk to an insurance risk, which is something that people better understand. In Munich, reinsurance, we found a reinsurance partner and so we now have the credit fully insured. So it acts more like a kind of treasury product on chain. But in the end, you're still financing farmers in Colombia.
00:39:29.748 - 00:39:41.172, Speaker A: Right. And so what is that? I mean, when you've done all that de risking, what do those things look like from a return perspective? And how does that line up to what investors are generally expecting in this area?
00:39:41.348 - 00:40:29.326, Speaker B: Yeah. So in this kind of area. So we're now talking about 910 percent annualized on dollars. So that is for a fully insured forex hedged kind of product. Now, there is a possibility to get this product even rated. So like a Fitch or an S and P or a Moody's, they might rate this product, which would bring the yield down a little bit more, but which would allow us to potentially sell this product to pension funds because it becomes a pension fund eligible kind of product. And we believe it's this very hard and painful work that we have to go through with credits to be able to really bring the big boys to the table.
00:40:29.326 - 00:40:57.186, Speaker B: And then the conversation doesn't become any more like, hey, do you want to buy like, credits on the blockchain? Sounds really fun and innovative and you can do a nice press release, but it's like, look, we have, like, a very good credit product here where you will get your data in real time. It's like fully automated. There is no room for manual errors. Cash flows are flowing automatically, which is one of the biggest pains in cross border credit, by the way. It's on the blockchain, but you shouldn't care.
00:40:57.250 - 00:41:36.022, Speaker A: Right. So what do you think? The. And obviously, no one's going to hold you to numbers here, but when you're looking at the efficiency gains of being able to use smart contracts and Solana and USDC and all these different technologies that are really, like, built from blockchain, but the core business itself is not necessarily touching. The core business is not built on blockchain, but it's using blockchain for these core functions. What's your sort of spitball estimation of efficiency gains that come from doing this, as opposed to saying, you know what, we have a great idea. We're a technology forward group of individuals. We're going to just build this off chain as a modern fintech company.
00:41:36.158 - 00:42:02.274, Speaker B: Yeah. So today we're seeing around 100 to 200 basis points in efficiency gains in savings to our system. And we believe by having deeper data integrations, using even more automation tools, putting the smart contracts even better to work, getting more direct adoption, we can almost double that.
00:42:02.574 - 00:42:05.174, Speaker A: Very cool. That's quite substantial.
00:42:05.214 - 00:42:41.278, Speaker B: Yes, that's quite substantial, definitely. And then there is the indirect value that you can bring, and I think that is sometimes underestimated, is we meet some of these fintech companies in Brazil, and they're like a series a company, and they have like, 30 people, and then, like, okay, 30 people. It's. Okay. It's not an amazing head count, but then it's like, oh, half of them are in operations administration. They're in, like, not immediately. Core value adds.
00:42:41.278 - 00:42:54.194, Speaker B: And I'm not saying those people don't add value to the business, but, like, they should be able to do better things and they should be able to use these kind of technologies to scale their businesses easier and faster. Yeah.
00:42:56.854 - 00:43:09.356, Speaker A: That'S a very interesting future kind of for what this stuff looks like. And that sort of efficiency gain is like, I know it doesn't sound like a ton, but when you're talking about $200 million of assets moving through, that's a serious amount of money in savings.
00:43:09.460 - 00:43:36.634, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And then I think there is the future state as well. And again, I think we have to go back to the problem. The problem is there is $2 trillion that we need to finance in Latin America. And there is only $200 billion available. We need to bring more money into the country. We're not going to be able to bring more money in the country just by screaming from the roofs, like, hey, it's like an access premium.
00:43:36.634 - 00:44:21.458, Speaker B: It's not a risk premium. We have to show the data, and to show the data, it needs to be transparent, it needs to be auditable, and it cannot be, like, be able to be tampered with. This is blockchain. This is blockchain. Like, if we can build this track record on the blockchain of, like, how the assets are behaving, how the risk is behaving, how the repayments are being done, this will solve our problem in a long time, because then a big investor will be able to come and look and use, look at it and see, like, hey, I want to invest in this. This looks actually pretty good. I can run my analytics, I can run my nice AI model on this, and my AI model will say, like, hey, yeah, let's allocate 5% of our aum in these kind of credits.
00:44:21.546 - 00:45:07.836, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. When you bring blockchain into the stack here, one of the things that, like, a lot of you hear a lot from the traditional financial world, people who really haven't evaluated blockchain, but one of the pieces that they say is a problem is that the data is transparent. That data for them is the new oil and yada yada yada proprietary datasets. We don't want to be leaking kind of information. How have you thought about that in terms of the long term defensibility of what you guys are building? That sort of classic example of, like, there are many, many early fintech companies that prove a market, and then the big boys come in and just say, thank you very much. And how are you guys thinking about sort of that long term competitiveness?
00:45:08.020 - 00:45:56.542, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I think on the data piece, I feel this is a bit of, like, an excuse still for many to, like, move into it. I think it's a habit of hurdling all your own data, not sharing it, and thinking your data set is way better than the other data sets. I remember when I was doing this work previously, we built a shared KYC system on the blockchain, and in the beginning, all the banks were like, oh, but my KYC data is way better than your KYC data. And it's all bad. It's all bad data quality. So let's sit together, let's work for a standard, and I think the power will be in the one who is the smartest on how to use that data.
00:45:56.542 - 00:46:28.644, Speaker B: So I think over time it is an issue that we will be able to overcome. And then my big bet is also that there are much smarter people than myself building these kind of like zero knowledge, proof on chain, off chain oracle in a decentralized, efficient kind of way manner that still personal, identifiable data, as an example, we can still keep off chain or sharded or have lag mechanics for that. And I think that will be another technology innovation that we're already seeing and we will see even more at scale.
00:46:28.764 - 00:47:01.934, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. So last question before we wrap up today, I want to talk a little bit about stable coins in Latin America. Yes, it seems like it makes sense. It seems like it's a huge market. No one's really been able to crack it yet. It seems like everyone is still at the end of the day using USDC or USDT, or they're settling to a local fiat currency that is not tokenized at this point. Is that just a technology maturity? Is that a regulatory issue? Where do you see the future of stablecoins in Latin America?
00:47:02.054 - 00:47:37.624, Speaker B: Yeah, I think two things. I think there is still of a regulatory issue. It is not easy to bring in foreign currencies in these markets. They're often very protective for that. And the banks have positioned them really well that it's like, hey, if it doesn't pass through us, it's not coming into the country. So there are some control mechanisms that are not easy. If you're a new startup with a brand new id and you want to give people access to all these stable coins and use it very quickly, you hit a wall.
00:47:37.624 - 00:48:40.168, Speaker B: These are things that new regulations, the central bank, the local secs are all looking to solve because there is a huge need in these markets. There is a huge need in these markets to be able to hold dollars, to be able to hold any kind of stablecoin. And the local regulators are realizing this and the adoption that is already happening locally in, for example, Brazil, it is insane. I think during my last visit in the weekend, I went to go cycling and we went to go cycling, literally in the mountains of Brazil. And we did a small pit stop to buy a drink and you could, you could buy your drink with crypto there. Like you could use stable coins. Like here in New York, it's often still difficult to use Apple Pay at certain places.
00:48:40.168 - 00:49:38.274, Speaker B: So I strongly believe that the people will push for innovation. They will push the innovation agenda because they will demand the use of these stable coins of these crypto coins be able to invest freely. They are getting used to products like Nubank, full digital banks, full digital service, and they will demand nothing else. And I think that is like with blockchain general, right? I think we cannot underestimate. I think we're both probably seeing ourselves as still young and we're like, hey, we're innovative and we use all these new tools, but if you look at the generation that is coming after us, they're truly digitally native. Like, they will not accept it anymore. That if they go work for a financial institution, that they have to print something and like, run five blocks to register it with somebody who's like, faxing them back to them, they will not accept that anymore.
00:49:38.274 - 00:50:08.890, Speaker B: They will expect a digital native experience. And I think we're sometimes underestimating how big that need is and how much innovation that still is going to drive trigger. And so that's why it's very techy to say, but it is still early. We're still building the core infrastructure and primitives here to be able to have that digital experience anywhere beyond the financial services, but at scale. And so that's what we strongly believe in.
00:50:09.082 - 00:50:16.196, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I love that vision of the future and excited to see what you guys work on over the next year.
00:50:16.330 - 00:50:33.240, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, this was super fun. We're super excited about it. We're super proud to be part of the Solana ecosystem and be building on top of it. So I think we have a long road, a lot of hard work to go, but it's super exciting.
00:50:33.352 - 00:50:36.136, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Thomas, thanks for joining me today on validated.
00:50:36.280 - 00:50:37.584, Speaker B: Thank you. Appreciate it.
