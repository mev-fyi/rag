00:00:04.400 - 00:00:51.441, Speaker A: Today I'm joined by Dirt Diggler. So please tell us what are you building? I'm with FutureDao and we are building the Future protocol which is an on chain token migrator. Essentially you can think of it as a derugging platform. And so if you are with a protocol or with a product that has been rugged which we determine as you would think of as like a dev pulling or selling their funds, maybe you've lost product market fit, maybe you just ran out of money and so you need a fresh start. So you come to us, you put your community token in and you get a new one out. And so yeah it's pretty exciting and we're excited especially in this kind of in this meta where rugs seem to be happening daily to be able to save the value that is destroyed in the community when a rug occurs. Awesome.
00:00:51.441 - 00:00:54.225, Speaker A: Let's have less rugs. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you.
