00:00:00.280 - 00:00:20.454, Speaker A: Welcome to this week's Changelog. My name is Jacob Creech. I work as developer relations at Solana foundation. Today I'm joined by our new Solana developer relations advocate, John. So he just joined our team this past week. So let's get started with this week's changelog. So another call out on Solana Speedrun.
00:00:20.454 - 00:00:41.562, Speaker A: This is a game jam that's happening in a few weeks from now. This is where if you want to learn how to build a game or, or build a game amongst a bunch of other developers, definitely check out Solana Speedrun and join the kind of mini hackathon game jam. Come out with a cool game and.
00:00:41.578 - 00:00:52.866, Speaker B: Then another call out. If you have any questions, please post them on Stack exchange so they're more easy to find and upload any questions you see that you found helpful.
00:00:53.050 - 00:01:38.824, Speaker A: Yeah, engagement on stack exchanges is very vital or crucial to the health of our stack exchange. If you upload a good question or answer, it shows up better on results such as Google or any other search engine, helping out any developers that no longer have to go to discord anymore, they can just search their question and answer. And moving on to this week's proposal. So this week's proposal is SIMD 53 turbine with quic or quit using quic for propagating blocks across the cluster. So turbine is for block propagation. It currently uses UDP. This is a SImD to update that from using the current UDP implementation to using quic.
00:01:38.824 - 00:02:02.606, Speaker A: Quic, if you remember, was used earlier, I believe earlier last year to basically help out with transaction forwarding across the network. So kept the transactions from spamming the network, and now they're adding quip as well to turbine. What do you think of this, John?
00:02:02.790 - 00:02:07.230, Speaker B: So can you go over why this is important and why it might be relevant for the network?
00:02:07.422 - 00:02:44.904, Speaker A: Right. So turbine, since it's currently still using UDP, they want to make sure that we're all using the same networking protocol across the entire cluster. This is helpful for spam prevention, all sorts of things within the cluster. So it'll help out with basically getting the blocks propagated across the network over quic instead of UDP. Definitely. If you're more interested within this simd, check out the simd itself. It's still not accepted, it's still in a draft or being reviewed state.
00:02:44.904 - 00:02:58.094, Speaker A: So definitely go and leave your comments on the SIMD repo for the SIMD 53. And then John, what kind of different commits did you see this week?
00:02:58.214 - 00:03:05.142, Speaker B: The get random dependency has been explicitly declared, so you'll no longer run into issues with hash brown.
00:03:05.318 - 00:03:08.994, Speaker A: What kind of issues did you run into previously with hash Brown?
00:03:10.624 - 00:03:19.844, Speaker B: If when you built a program, you might have encountered an issue with git random, that would cause the build to fail. This should fix that issue.
00:03:20.184 - 00:03:28.392, Speaker A: Okay. So it just fixes the issue and you'll be good not running into basically a state where you could not build programs anymore.
00:03:28.568 - 00:03:29.336, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:29.520 - 00:04:15.710, Speaker A: So the other commit I saw was rolling out miracle shreds to 100% of testing slots. So what are shreds? Let's start there. So shreds are basically the subset of a block that they use whenever they're trying to send the different blocks across the network, when they send, aptly, as it is, across turbine, like we spoke about earlier within the SIMD. So sending these shreds across the network so that they can then be combined, create a block. This is trying out merkel shreds, which adds a few extra things of, like, proofs proving whether or not I have the full block and what. What I need around it. So this is kind of, like, still testing on Testnet.
00:04:15.710 - 00:04:26.414, Speaker A: It's not fully been ready for mainnet beta, but it'll be tested on Testnet first and then what kind of resource of the week did you see, John?
00:04:26.574 - 00:04:41.170, Speaker B: This week, Solandy has released a new video about securing PDA seats. It looks like he's doing a series on program security. So if you'd like to learn more about how to write secure Solana programs, check out Solandy's channel and his videos.
00:04:41.322 - 00:05:00.884, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, Solana Security is a big topic that everybody should be mindful of when they're building programs on top of Solana. It's really cool that Solandi is building this security series and going through the different issues that you might run into. So, yeah, definitely check it out. It's a good series.
00:05:01.224 - 00:05:05.192, Speaker B: And that's it for this week's changelog. Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next week.
00:05:05.368 - 00:05:05.984, Speaker A: All right, bye.
