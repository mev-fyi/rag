00:00:00.120 - 00:00:47.184, Speaker A: The transfer hook is I think one of the coolest new extensions of the new token extensions program and this is because it lets you add new functionality to your tokens. So how it works is you deploy a program, you implement the SPL transfer hook interface and then when you create the mint of your token you just add this program id as a parameter and now whenever you transfer this token from one wallet to another it will call this function here the transfer hook and you can add all kinds of cool functionality here. You can for example try to enforce NFT royalties or you can have a token which costs something when you transfer it or like in my case you can just fail when the amount is bigger than 50. So if I now try to transfer any amount that is bigger than 50 then it will just throw an error and say hey the amount is too big. So yeah try it out. I think this opens possibility for tons of cool new tokens.
