00:00:14.080 - 00:00:32.590, Speaker A: Well, thank you for the introduction, Marin, and thank you guys for having us today. As Marin said, we were talking about basically lending in Defi in general, obviously also focused on Solana ecosystem. My name is Lars and I think we'll just go one by one, quickly introducing ourselves, what we're doing, what the protocols we're working for are doing, and then we'll get into the discussion. Maybe, William, you can start.
00:00:32.742 - 00:00:43.514, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Will Barnes, I work on Jet, co founder. We are a borrowing lending protocol bill in Solana. Of course, I previously worked at Makerdao and Consensys.
00:00:44.294 - 00:00:53.114, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm Senix, I work on Tulip. We're a yield farming protocol and we also have lending that also allows us to do leverage yield farming.
00:00:53.654 - 00:01:03.986, Speaker D: Hey everyone, I'm Tristan and I'm a co contributor to Zeta. We are an under collateralized derivatives trading platform and we offer future and options trading.
00:01:04.170 - 00:01:14.050, Speaker E: Hi, I'm Ming, I'm from mercurial. So we built a couple of things, including mercurial and Jupyter, which is so aggregator, and we are integrating lending into our next vision of product.
00:01:14.162 - 00:01:38.894, Speaker A: Yeah, great. Maybe we can, for a start, get into the differences of actually defi and traffic for the landing. The meme has been for the longest time, productive assets in a sense. Now you can get into Defi as the core use case of Defi and it's landing basically. Maybe elaborate on savings on top of that. Why do users do it? Why is it so important? How is your protocol utilizing that? And how can users actually earn yield with that?
00:01:40.594 - 00:02:24.328, Speaker B: Well, the use case that I think is most common is you have an asset like Sol or ETH and you don't want to give up exposure to it. Deposit into a lending pool and then borrow stables against it. And you can either use those stables to do whatever you want, or you can just leverage up or down or whatever. And that's been the big case, like, you know, for people who do that early in like a market cycle, like, it's like a pretty good way to earn a little more money. But you know, also like, people are just like tacking on liquidity mining programs to just put a bunch of cash in these things. And like, I mean, that's been the thing so far, I think. And I'd say, I don't know, is that sustainable?
00:02:24.376 - 00:02:24.752, Speaker A: Probably not.
00:02:24.768 - 00:02:34.044, Speaker B: I think you wouldn't really find sustainable yields like that in traditional finance, but I'd say it's more of like indicative of the market cycle we're in right now.
00:02:35.064 - 00:02:42.826, Speaker A: If you get savings on top, maybe as like an additional use case for lending. Like how do you see that developing right now in Solana in general? Maybe so.
00:02:42.850 - 00:03:32.824, Speaker E: Actually for us, it's like if you see the AMm game, right, for example, there might be 1 billion in Jupiter in curve, but any given moment you only need two or 3 million fossil swaps. So you literally have 98% of capital there doing nothing. So I think that is the thing that we are going to work on. I think the main thing there is how do we put all the capital that's sitting the amms into use? I think that probably for us, the best and the most sustainable, sustainable way to put all the assets is in lending. So I think for us, I think as more and more lending protocols come up, there will be four or five. I think the question is, how do we distribute across the four to five markets in a way that will generate the best yield for our Amm? So in many ways, I think the future of AMM will also depend a lot on lending around. How do we leverage lending platforms to provide sustainable use for all the capital and amms.
00:03:35.784 - 00:04:09.646, Speaker C: For lending side for our platform, we basically allow a lot of users to lend out their altcoins, which usually don't see a market. And that's because we also allow users to borrow under collateralized to do like leverage yield farming. Otherwise, a lot of these assets will kind of just sit idle. And like with leverage yield farming, we actually allow people to do under collateralized, because basically we control the lending markets and we basically lend it to ourselves, which we lend it to users and the assets don't leave the platform, which makes it safe to do it under collateralized.
00:04:09.790 - 00:04:41.760, Speaker A: So basically, to move from where we are now in the sense of landing as a use case. What he's saying is we're basically taking what traffic already is doing and integrating into defi, in a sense, specifically Solana ecosystem. Maybe, Tristan, you can get a bit into how you see lending developing on top with maybe unclear lending or cross chain lending over the next, say, 612 months. Where now what are you building on? Where do we want to get maybe, and what are the pitfalls we have to be aware of there?
00:04:41.912 - 00:05:13.054, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. We're really excited to integrate with some of the lending products out there. We're basically like a cash margined protocol for derivatives. And so a really nice use case for us is we integrate with the lending market and we can do cross collateral. So because you're using USDC for all these markets, you can essentially, because everyone who is a Solana bull will be holding a lot of Solana. It's really cool that they can come in there with their solana. They can borrow USDC margin from that, from a lending market, and then they can actually use that to go long on an option, say, on our platform.
00:05:13.054 - 00:05:14.874, Speaker D: So we're really excited for that.
00:05:17.534 - 00:06:09.126, Speaker E: You mentioned cross chain. So I think one of the most interesting thing is actually cross chain, because right now, if you look at the different markets, they're still operating at silos. The risks on Ethereum are way lower than risks on Solana. And I'm sure, and later on, when there are some new platforms coming up, I think the risk will differ a lot as well. I think one of the things that we're really interesting is that wormhole V two is coming out, and it's actually fairly sophisticated because you can move from just doing token bridges to doing arbitrary message passing. So I think it will be really interesting to see how a layer abstraction, layer on top of all these chains can be built such that we can seamlessly go from one chain to another chain with redder transaction cost. One of the biggest issue today in lending is that most of the capital is on Ethereum.
00:06:09.126 - 00:06:26.584, Speaker E: Ethereum is amazing, obviously, but it's so expensive to move anything anywhere. Doing any kind of rebalancing on Ethereum is very expensive. I think as we move forward into where most of the capital are in chains, cheaper chains, especially Solana, I think we're going to see a lot more cross chain rebalancing going on.
00:06:27.324 - 00:07:12.612, Speaker A: Maybe Sanex like in general, about the anecdotes lending about the cross chain. What do you think will be the use case going forward for that? There's specific issues that we still have to deal with. Usually the way it works in Megadau as well and stuff we over collateralize, then we borrow against it. Obviously, if I see Mars is called, then you have to secure it. If you go under collateralized, you have to have certain, not just assumptions, maybe KYC lending, you can initially just have a pool of, let's say, whitelisted institutions without getting into certain names. In general, where do you see the pitfalls right now? What we still need to overcome to.
00:07:12.628 - 00:07:37.734, Speaker C: Get there for ourselves right now we have it set up. Where it's whitelisted. Might consider in the future is just have our lending pools interact with other protocols as like a central, like kind of like a central lending, but to like protocols themselves, which means that like, because they're also trusted parties, we don't actually have to have them use, like, over collateralized loans to take out, like, loans against, like, our assets. Basically.
00:07:38.394 - 00:07:48.170, Speaker A: I think Tristan, you mentioned previously while we talked also, like, the, like, the block time is very important for that. Right? Like, basically what? Well, like, the use case you have right now, what you're building on, you actually can't do another change. Right?
00:07:48.242 - 00:07:48.618, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:48.706 - 00:07:51.434, Speaker A: So maybe you can elaborate on that a bit for the audience. I think that would be great.
00:07:51.554 - 00:08:20.518, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So because we're an under collateralized trading platform, that's basically why we ended up having to build on Solana. On Ethereum, you have these really, really slow block times, and it means you actually can't run efficient liquidators, whereas on Solana, you have a full 100 millisecond block time. We can basically liquidate people in real time, which allows us to do under collateralized trading, which is super exciting. People can lever up on our platform, basically go ten x leverage. They can put on these kind of positions. This is especially prevalent when you're doing options trading.
00:08:20.518 - 00:08:53.461, Speaker D: Say you're selling different options. The marginal requirements are typically very high. If you're an under collateralized platform, it's very hard for market participants, market makers, to actually trade on your platform because you're having to post ridiculous amounts of collateral. However, what we do on our platform is we can do under collateralized trading, so people are only having to post up like 10% of what you'd normally need. And, yeah, because we're able to run this efficient liquidator network, that's how it all kind of functions under the hood. We also take a portfolio level view of all the different positions that you have on. And so we can basically make some kind of concessions.
00:08:53.461 - 00:09:05.405, Speaker D: I guess if you're kind of, I guess, like, hedged out on some of the positions, you know, people don't have to post on each individual leg. We look at everything they have in their portfolio, like you'd be used to with like, FTX, and we can kind of margin based on that.
00:09:05.509 - 00:09:12.648, Speaker A: Do you see like maybe KYc learning, like, actually, like, if you take it like a step, that you can maybe lower that collateral further to, let's say, even as a 0%.
00:09:12.776 - 00:09:16.648, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I definitely agree. We haven't got to that stage yet, but, yeah, super excited for that.
00:09:16.736 - 00:09:27.324, Speaker A: So they'll be like, what do you think is the timeframe for us for come up both of your protocols in general? Maybe more like half a year, one year? What are the steps we still need to basically take for that?
00:09:27.904 - 00:09:45.804, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, we're still trying to fully get to Mainnet, we've got all the under collateralized stuff working, so you can kind of demo that out and try it. We're trying to integrate with these lending platforms as well, I think over the next couple of months. And yeah, I think it's just going to unlock a hell of a lot of really interesting under collateralized trading and capital efficiency there.
00:09:45.924 - 00:09:59.652, Speaker A: And curious for will, given especially your background on Mecca Dow, how do you see there's two worlds? It's one is over collateralized, one is basically what's going on here on Solana. How do you see that? How do you compare that? What do you think? Interesting for both worlds, and what do you think will be happening in the.
00:09:59.668 - 00:10:40.054, Speaker B: Next few months for, I mean, collateralizing loans is like standard. I think everyone's done that. But I also think there's a lot of demand for unsecured loans. And there's like a difference between unsecured loans and like under collateralized loans. Because under collateralized loans for lending specifically, I don't think it's really applicable to, like, options because you have to liquidate. But like, if you're lending someone money unsecured, like, I don't understand why you would do an underclotalized loan because then you just give them a little less money. But then also, we had this discussion here with someone just yesterday was, you're not really lending unsecured.
00:10:40.054 - 00:11:36.086, Speaker B: It would be like an institution in the crypto space that would presumably be trusted, and they're basically collateralizing their reputation and their ability to borrow in the future. But you have a lot of institutional firms, crypto native, that do want to borrow unsecured, because they just, they're like doing delta neutral trades or whatever. And I mean, there's really good examples of that, like Maple and Truefi on Ethereum. And yeah, I see that as also like, you know, they're starting to carve out like a more nuanced market for lending, where you can do like 90 day loans. I think as time goes along, loans, people are going to want to borrow for longer, but they do the same thing. There's also decentralized lenders. I sort of see that moving on chain and being done more algorithmically.
00:11:36.086 - 00:11:57.014, Speaker B: But I don't think most folks, I think, still just want to point and click and borrow. But I'd say Solana being a chain, that is, I'd say more DeFi focused, like being able to do these more esoteric lending products will be a big benefit. And I think a lot of institutions would use them.
00:11:59.034 - 00:12:18.518, Speaker A: So I think what's key, like you mentioned, basically institutions versus retail, maybe in general, as we can see different use cases, obviously for a different kind of audience, maybe you can get into. Do you see it more as a spectrum developing within protocols, or do you see more specialization of protocols for many institutions on chain traders or more like retail?
00:12:18.566 - 00:13:05.050, Speaker E: Right, so great question, right? Because one of the things that we're working on is actually what we consider institutional vault, where we allow institutions to borrow with a collateral. And the reason that has been a bit slow to develop is because when all your capital is on collateralized, people know where the money is. You can easily refer on chain, okay, the money is here, the collateral ratio is all this. And it's very simple to understand. But then when you move towards a system whereby you say, okay, I'm going to allow someone to land without, say, a collateral. So it becomes a big identity issue. It's like, okay, and then I think, so when we talk, there's actually a tremendous amount of interest from institutions to actually borrow the money on chain.
00:13:05.050 - 00:14:13.024, Speaker E: But then the question becomes, okay, are there two problems? Number one is that we have to tell the community where the money is going and then are they comfortable with that? And second thing is that enforcement, okay, when things go wrong, how is enforcement done? Do we go to a legal system? Do we go to the courts? And it's a really big problem. And then thirdly, there's also the identity issue. Do you guys know vercoin, the irish thing? And that's creepy as fuck, but we need some kind of identity. It's like maybe say, okay, if you have irish scan, maybe you have 2% or something, I don't know. But I think, I think instead of making it binary like institution versus nutrition, I think it becomes a spectrum of identity and credibility. So it's like, okay, for example, if I'm willing to, say, borrow like $100, for example, say Alitali, he's willing to tweet that I'm borrowing $100. I'm sure people find that credible, but then, you know what I mean? So I think the way we're going to move along this thing would not be so much the binary thing by spectrum.
00:14:13.024 - 00:14:35.148, Speaker E: And of both the willingness of the borrowers to, sorry. Both the willingness of the lenders to trust the identity as well as the willingness of the borrower to dox themselves, I think there's going to be and then put some reputation beside that thing. So I think we're going to see a spectrum developing and worldcoin is probably the most interesting example.
00:14:35.236 - 00:14:55.716, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for maybe Tristan, that's actually very interesting. Your protocol should definitely be more on the institutional side of use cases, and you don't really have the reputational issue per se. They're known in a sense, when they borrow. I think the issue then becomes, how do you still enforce something if something goes wrong? In a sense, how are you working on that? Where do you see that going? Basically as sizes also scale up.
00:14:55.740 - 00:15:41.726, Speaker D: Obviously, that makes sense. Zeta is trying to be as permissionless as possible. The way that we're doing it with liquidators, you basically are going to get liquidated anyway. We don't have to have these permissioned or whitelisted people necessarily, but there are a lot of institutions on there, and that's the market for options right now, is a lot of these institutional players which will come in there and take on a bit of the risk. The way that we are trying to backstop it is obviously when huge, huge liquidation events happen, there is going to be, what do you call it? Like a backstopping fund. So if people do go massively underwater, the platform isn't able to recover. We're able to bail out from that kind of fund.
00:15:41.726 - 00:16:00.824, Speaker D: But in terms of our strategy, we're building this on chain market maker as well. And so we try and delta hedge that as much as possible, like periodically take off risk. And so when the price does invariably dump, we should hopefully be fairly neutral and not have too much exposure there. So we're hoping that we never get into these kind of black swan events in the first place.
00:16:01.844 - 00:16:02.744, Speaker A: They will.
00:16:03.804 - 00:16:38.906, Speaker B: I really like that whole approach, because it's not ethereum, it's not 15 2nd block times. You can liquidate faster, like Tristan said, and I mean, you see like really big exchanges doing this. Like FTX has a backstop program. Industry is really good for making sure that the protocol or that the exchange doesn't lose money. And you can emulate these things on Solana as well. And we're getting there. Most developers are inching towards this, but we're not there yet.
00:16:38.906 - 00:17:00.754, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff that has to change. Transaction size limit. I'd say right now most folks, folks are just like working on their products and testing them and piloting them, but it's definitely, these things are being built. And yeah, I'd say it's more or less just a time and development thing.
00:17:02.054 - 00:17:13.182, Speaker A: Maybe to wrap it up. Also synx. And generally, I think maybe you can talk what will just mentioned, what is still missing from tech side, actually to get where you want to get in the protocol, to basically get to that vision.
00:17:13.278 - 00:17:14.086, Speaker B: Sorry, what's the.
00:17:14.190 - 00:17:15.710, Speaker A: Yeah, what's the missing assessment from the tech side?
00:17:15.742 - 00:17:15.862, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:15.878 - 00:17:21.998, Speaker A: Like, as you mentioned, like, for example, like the block limit and stuff, maybe like, just. Yeah, go on raw.
00:17:22.166 - 00:18:00.152, Speaker B: So anchor has been like a, you know, we use anchor a lot and Armani built that. It's just a great tool for piloting things. And, yeah, I believe they're doubling the transaction size and then soon, which will help. There's a lot of things, you know, I think every developer here is, like, has experienced, you know, the transaction size limits and is like, trying to work around them. That's like a stark difference from Ethereum. Yeah. So I'd say, like, just, you know, the communication between devs and Solana and, like, improving the things we can do would help a lot.
00:18:00.152 - 00:18:23.010, Speaker B: And just like, you know, maybe a good, like, development cycle of like six months to a year, I think you'll see a lot different, many different, many new protocols, and many, like, the tech will be a lot different. I think. I'm almost sure of that because people are starting to change things. They're building things that are more Solana native, that aren't just like direct copies from Ethereum, which is great. Like, that's what you want, maybe.
00:18:23.042 - 00:18:23.850, Speaker A: So next.
00:18:24.042 - 00:18:51.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with the transaction thing. So Solana has like, a proposal where they're upgrading the transaction to, like, basically. And that will probably make for a lot better ux, because for us, when we open a leverage position, you need to sign basically five transactions in the same time. And if one of the transactions fail, you have to do all five over again. So having a bigger transaction will probably improve the UX overall.
00:18:51.542 - 00:18:52.198, Speaker A: Justin?
00:18:52.286 - 00:19:23.806, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't want to parrot everyone, but, yeah, also, it's the fundamental kind of limitations there, transaction sizes, it's like a 200k gas limit there. And for us, it's definitely challenging. We have to basically write this on chain pricing about options. So it's writing a black Scholes options pricing calculator. There's a lot of math functions in there, kind of like logs, square roots, which use up a ton of compute. And we're having to price, like, eleven options calls and puts. So 22 plus a future 23 options price with a mathematical function in one transaction is kind of challenging.
00:19:23.806 - 00:19:47.420, Speaker D: And we've worked around those constraints and found some nice approximations to get it to work, but that's been really hard. And then we're maintaining like, a volatility surface and doing all this other complicated stuff. Trying to fit it in one transaction is pretty challenging, and we're kind of getting there otherwise. Yeah, I guess it's like account limits that you can kind of pass into every transaction. We want to go to cross margining and that kind of stuff between all these different assets. And, yeah, it starts to get pretty challenging.
00:19:47.452 - 00:19:48.404, Speaker A: What do you mean, quickly?
00:19:48.524 - 00:20:01.170, Speaker E: Oh, yeah. I just want to say that everything is said, you know? But honestly, one last thing is, I love the limits. Right. I mean, I hate it, obviously. Right. Pin the ass. But they really show that sonar takes a different set of trade offs on EVM, you can do as much as you want.
00:20:01.170 - 00:20:14.614, Speaker E: There's no limit. I think it's actually really nice to have these things to work with and be early, involved early in the process. I think for us, I think composability is huge. We want to do a lot more things, a lot more algorithms. I think they'll be tough. I think.
00:20:15.114 - 00:20:26.704, Speaker A: Thanks for having us, for having the script to talk, guys. It was very great. I think we could talk on for a long time. I think the takeaway is work in progress. We're getting there, and maybe we'll learn more on the next panel. Okay, thanks.
