00:00:03.400 - 00:00:19.685, Speaker A: Hey, all, I'm Vibhu. I'm the co founder CEO of Drip. If you don't know Drip, I only have five minutes, so I'm going to rush through this. We're the number one non DeFi app on Solana. If you don't know Drip, by the way, just open up Phantom. You can find us usually in the top couple apps on there. You should give a try.
00:00:19.685 - 00:00:49.565, Speaker A: Drip is the collectibles platform. What does that mean? Collectibles is digital content that you own secured on the Solana blockchain. We have three products. This is the core product, the Drip dapp for desktop. And obviously there's a mobile version of this as well. Beautiful, gorgeous product. This is Drip creator Studio, which we launched a month ago, lets creators publish their content and media on the Solana blockchain as a collectible.
00:00:49.565 - 00:01:22.235, Speaker A: And today I'm going to introduce you to Drip Mobile. I'm very thankful to the production team because they are going to let me do a live demo from my phone. All right, we have an announcement to make. We are right now opening a public beta for the drip for iOS and drip for Android. So if you have an Apple device, please scan this code. You do need a Drip account first. So if you don't have a Drip account yet, this is not going to work.
00:01:22.235 - 00:01:47.609, Speaker A: So before you get into the app, you go into the dripd app, you're going to add an email address and that will let you sign into the public beta here. And if you have Android here, you can scan this one as well. All right, so I know creative Drew. He's very nervous. He's the lead behind this app here. So this is running live on my phone here. Let's run through it.
00:01:47.609 - 00:02:07.673, Speaker A: So first thing everyone does when they wake up, they play legendary lock in. Check this out. We built a little portable game player here. Let's see if we get rugged. Nope. There you go. Live demos in action.
00:02:07.673 - 00:02:26.799, Speaker A: It's not working. All right. The Internet is okay. All right, we'll do something else. So check this out. I mean, there's nothing like this in the crypto world, in my opinion. I'm going to click this button here I just collected on the Salon blockchain.
00:02:26.799 - 00:02:45.543, Speaker A: That's instantaneous. This is gasless air dropped right to my Solana wallet. Everything that Drip does is off chain to on chain. Let's try again here. We're going to go ahead and we're going to donate to a creator. This is about a dollar. Boom.
00:02:45.543 - 00:03:10.015, Speaker A: I just donated a dollar USDC to a Creator. You didn't feel the wallet. There was no wallet, connect, dialogue, nothing. It just kind of works. This is really the magic of Drip that you can see here. The app is a first class app in my opinion. It feels like Instagram, but everything that you do on it is interacting with the creator directly, helping them get paid.
00:03:10.015 - 00:03:34.945, Speaker A: I can't play audio from here, unfortunately, but you can see what this looks like here. We go ahead and play a song. I don't think it's going to work, but we support background audio in the app. So you can actually play something. You can close the app and it continues to play in the background, which is pretty cool. And in fact, it even is sticky to the app. So you can see I'm scrolling here and it's still playing.
00:03:34.945 - 00:04:10.055, Speaker A: For the first time ever, we have crypto auctions on a mobile app natively. So there is some NSFW content on Drip as well, if that's of interest to you. So again, it's off chain to on chain. So I can bid on an auction without having to sign any transactions, which is pretty cool. See all the participants here and yeah, we just bid there with the highest bidder. Now there I am. You can browse your wallet.
00:04:10.055 - 00:04:34.001, Speaker A: So we Support up to 50,000 collectibles in your wallet today. The leading wallet products in Solana today support around 2000. So we have many users who have thousands or tens of thousands of collectibles and it all just works. Pretty cool. Yeah, that's a little bit about it. The main point here was I wanted to announce the open beta. Please try it out.
00:04:34.001 - 00:04:44.425, Speaker A: This is truly a beta. We want your feedback, we want you guys to throw everything at it and tell us what we can do better and yeah, we'll see you on the Drip leaderboards. Thank you.
