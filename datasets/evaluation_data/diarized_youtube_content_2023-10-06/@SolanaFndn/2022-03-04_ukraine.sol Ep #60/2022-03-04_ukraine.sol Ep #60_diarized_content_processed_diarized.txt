00:00:09.840 - 00:00:39.562, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to a special episode of the Solana podcast. I'm Austin Federa. Today we're joined by Sergei Vasilchuk, who is the CEO of Everstake. But we're actually not here to talk today about Everstake. We're here to talk about aid for Ukraine and the situation in Ukraine and the project that Sergei and a bunch of others from the Ukraine and connected to the Ukraine have launched, which is a fundraising effort to help raise money that's urgently needed for the government and for people there. Sergei, welcome and thanks for joining us today. Sergei.
00:00:39.578 - 00:01:14.418, Speaker B: Yeah, hi, guys. Thank you for listening to me and thank you for helping us in this difficult situation. And, yeah, like, situation that Ukraine is quite terrible. So, like, we are like, protecting our country for the probably close to the week, and we are struggling with one of the biggest army in the world, but we still resist, and sure we will soon. But this win is not just a magic. Many of the people trying to protect their country, military are dying. Military are fighting.
00:01:14.418 - 00:01:47.550, Speaker B: The civilians also try to do all they can. And general situation is that every citizen of the Ukraine doesn't depend on where it's located, what he can do. Like, they do something. I do not know anyone who just sit in the idol and observing the news first probably two days for me was shocked. I cannot believe what has happened. I was just stuck to the news and seeing what is going on, calling some relatives, asking what can help and what's going on. It's just shock.
00:01:47.550 - 00:02:16.850, Speaker B: I was stuck, but sooner or later, like, I was like, had the conversation with Anatoly Yakovienka from Solana. He, like, originally ukrainian. He asked him, like, hey, guys, like, what is going on? Like, how we can help you, like, let's do something. And I said, yeah, like, we. I cannot, like, sit and cry and wait and I need to do something. And it was the case when we started to, like, to understand that we need some impact, and that's why we decided to start this activity.
00:02:16.972 - 00:02:59.636, Speaker A: So the process here that's been running on is there's Ukraine Sol, which is a bonfide name routing layer, address that routes to a wallet that's controlled by a multisig dao on Solana, you can go to nation IO Dao Ukraine. You can see this there too. There's about 1.45 million contributed so far, as well as several nfts from projects that will also be sold and liquidated generate funds here there's a lot of different efforts raising different kinds of crypto to aid the government and the people, what was sort of your thought to do this, to start this up? And can you talk a little bit about how the country is actually involved as well in the government?
00:02:59.740 - 00:03:38.984, Speaker B: Well, we have quite unusual ministry which call ministry of the digital transformation. It was created a few years ago and many of the politicians was skeptical and was a bit like Latin the day. These just like few guys from the IT background, they will not change nothing. But for these two years, guys like made the great application which probably have the digital id, have digital driver license, have the digital vaccination certificate, whatever. So it goes digital. Many of the services of the country are becoming our smartphone and those guys are. Are quite trustworthy and respectable in our community.
00:03:38.984 - 00:04:34.384, Speaker B: They just start to accept the donation in any form of the money that is available. And you should understand that currently there is martial law in the Ukraine and central bank put limitation that is hard to transact in foreign countries. Foreign countries foreign currency for us is euro or dollar. So for example, I cannot transfer some USD to any other recipient outside Ukraine. And many of the volunteer organizations need to pay because for example, night vision equipment or other stuff is outside Ukraine. So crypto become the obvious things to transact probably without the bureaucracy, without like need to go to the bank. Because like it's impossible to go through the bank in the many of the cities of Ukraine.
00:04:34.384 - 00:05:33.904, Speaker B: Is war, is real war. So like why crypto is obvious, why government and multi seek is because like I was asking for like many of partners asked me how we can help you and I said, hey, just donate. Many of them was capital. But what the source of this donation, who are controlling those money? Can you guarantee us that this money will be like controlled by some legitimate like people? And yeah, it was a good question. I was like calling the guys from this ministry, we call it the digital ministry and say, can you help us to make it more legitimate? How do you make some post on the Twitter with these others? They say, yes, of course we can do so. I take some of the guys, he's deputy of the ministry, which provide his own Solana key to the multi sig. I also call in few respectable blockchain companies, founders of these companies in the Ukraine who are well known.
00:05:33.904 - 00:05:55.834, Speaker B: They also provide their keys and we create the multi seq with 60% of the threshold and link our twitters to each of the keys. So it's transparent. So everyone see who is signing, what is signing and his blockchain is totally transparent. You can go to this nation which build by Solana and see our Dao and see what is going on?
00:05:55.944 - 00:06:25.180, Speaker A: Yeah, the multisig is also, I mean, if you just think about the logistics of operating in a war zone, you don't know who's available to sign a transaction at any specific place. So having it split up into a multisig that has a proportional threshold requirement just allows the whole project to be much more nimble. So funds that are create, are collected into this dao, they're then going to. The request from the government is pretty much to receive fiat currency at the end, is that correct?
00:06:25.292 - 00:07:16.034, Speaker B: Yeah. There is like two problems here. Problem one is their martial law with restriction problems too, that currently in the Ukraine there are not much exchanges which are able to transact in the USDT or in the foreign currency that we need to convert. And if there are some, they are not very scalable. And sometimes vendors don't just have the crypto. So we trying to find the way to make a sustainable, unlimited outramp solution to be able to liquidate crypto and to put this to the account. And second issue here that also people need to know that we are spending money in the right hand, in the proper proportion and so on.
00:07:16.034 - 00:08:08.016, Speaker B: So, and you should understand that the only trustworthy for everyone outside the Ukraine is government. So government is resisting, is successfully resisting for the biggest army in the world. So who can put their reputation on? Yeah, this is guys who are saving us. So that's why we're going to build this unlimited gateway and put money directly to the central bank. Why central bank? Because they own nt, who is able to transact freely with outside the world. And they have special account which were opened recently to all the donations for the military operation, for the humanitarian operation, whatever. And we go into fund those accounts after we try this to some scale amount, not a significant amount.
00:08:08.016 - 00:08:34.688, Speaker B: I believe that 1 million is not a significant amount. To have the impact in this strategy, work will be trying to advertise the solution for the wide, for the wide audience. Like I want to build something that would allow every crypto holder, like don't depend it from his size. It will be hamster or whale to donate an impact as easy as $1. The $10 million. This is something that we're going to do probably just tomorrow.
00:08:34.856 - 00:09:14.142, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great to hear. And especially the ability of crypto to step in here and be a transfer medium that works 24, 7365 days a year. Even with the restrictions of having to get to fiat currency at some point, it means that at least you know what's in the account and you're not waiting on banking hours in order for this to happen. And I think there's probably also a safety component, too, where people can donate in a more anonymous fashion compared to having to donate with a credit card or an account transfer if they themselves are in a situation where it may not be safe for them. Maybe they're inside of Russia and they're actually still donating to something like this.
00:09:14.238 - 00:09:39.354, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. It's just the new tool, the new generation tool in our company, in between us, we call banking, like legacy system. So for us, the new finance is blockchain, and everything that connected with the bank is legacy. But yes, sometimes we need the bridge become the system. But obviously, for me, crypto is the new generation. I'm in this market for the ten years, and I am 100% crypto guys, and this is how I can be useful for my country.
00:09:39.664 - 00:10:04.744, Speaker A: So there's a real asymmetry of information here, as far as the media has been reporting that many people who are in Ukraine are not able to necessarily always get information out. And it's a little bit hard to understand what's always going on over there, especially for someone like me who's in the United States. What have you sort of been hearing from friends and family and colleagues about the situation there now?
00:10:04.864 - 00:10:40.846, Speaker B: Well, I'm on the Rio, like, every minute, so you understand. Like, my parents stayed there, my sisters stayed there, my friends stayed there. Like, everyone who stayed there, like, males are putting the guns and protecting the territory. Females trying to be helpful with volunteering, with the medicine, with anything. Even kids try to do something, but it's not possible everywhere. After the five days of trying to, like, win our nation by the fire, contact proc Russia. Understand that it doesn't work.
00:10:40.846 - 00:11:29.746, Speaker B: And now they try to use ballistic rockets, like missiles to hit our civilian cities. So what is going on currently? Kharkiv is bombing, Kyiv is bombing, Jhtomir is bombing. So they try to scare the people. One thing that they don't understand, that they just bring more hate and angry, not the scaring. So we are the nation that we unite against the enemy. Like, we're saying we have the problem with, like, 214. They took some sort of territory, and those situations, the country was weak, so probably they tried to use the same approach, but it doesn't work right now.
00:11:29.746 - 00:11:52.014, Speaker B: So its strategy is a full scale war with thousands of the deaths of the civilian, with a thousand of the deaths of the military, and with the damages of the infrastructure. So it's not a movie. It looks like a movie, but this is real life that currently we Ukrainians are facing.
00:11:52.434 - 00:12:35.980, Speaker A: And just in the last few days, the. I would say that the international community has moved very slowly, but they are moving, especially financially, to have there be real consequences for this in terms of freezing foreign assets from the russian government and imposing stricter restrictions on it. Do you have an idea? Do you have a sense of the magnitude of the need right now that Ukraine has that both from the Internet, obviously, there's donations that people can do. There's also congresspeople they can call, there's other political actors that they can call. What are the right steps for someone who's trying to get involved beyond just donating?
00:12:36.092 - 00:13:07.336, Speaker B: Well, the biggest problem for the Ukraine is our sky. So we have not advanced systems to protect from the missiles in Draken. And if somebody can close our sky, no chance for enemy to win us. So all current attacks went from the sky. So if anyone could call the congressman, their government, and impact something that the west could close our sky, be sure that we will resist. We kick their ass and we go away. They will go away from our territory.
00:13:07.336 - 00:13:38.074, Speaker B: We hit these jet fighters just because they are excellent pilots, but our capacity is limited. So the more like jazz, the more weapons we want. Something that protects our sky will help us. Probably. We do not need anything more from the military point of view. If you want donate us, donate. But you should understand that sometimes this money will be useless if they will not go to some specific direction.
00:13:38.074 - 00:14:31.852, Speaker B: For example, Kharkiv. They need medicine, they need everything. But there is no logistic around because everything is destroyed, no rows around. So the best way is to contact some volunteers who live in some specific places which have the access to the some logistics and have the contacts with civilian and the military to ask directly, what do you need and what you want to have. This is where we also want you to interact with. After they're building this like crypto gateway to the central bank, we probably will try to onboard for the big exchanges, like for the crypto exchanges funds who will be able to make this like direct support. And after this, we'll be able to send the crypto to liquidate the exchanges and to help this way.
00:14:31.852 - 00:15:15.840, Speaker B: I know many of the suppliers are already asserting crypto because some of the solutions, like probably FTX or Coinbase, make it quite seamless transactions. So they send the invoices probably in the US dollars. But like we're receiving this in the form of the crypto, some magic happens inside the exchange and guys receiving the fiat. And the more these guys will be born with the crypto it will be like more like widespreading and something that we call adoption like unfortunately these mass adoptions go in such situation as a war with a thought that will go organically now it goes in the extremely.
00:15:15.952 - 00:15:45.810, Speaker A: Situations well SergeY thank you. Thank you so much for joining us today. We'll have to have you back to talk about Everstake at some point which is something I've been meaning to do for a long time. But this obviously takes priority today. If people are interested in learning more and helping out, you can go to nation IO Dow Ukraine that is connected to the same back end as the SPL governance program. So you can also just donate directly on Jane at Ukraine Sol which will accept any SPl token and any NFT as well.
00:15:45.922 - 00:16:03.728, Speaker B: Yeah thank you guys for listening to me. Please try to donate something to support like our survival. Thank you Austin. Thank you Solana community. You are amazing. Please contribute something. It will be small but very important and impactful for contribution to save Ukraine as a nation.
00:16:03.728 - 00:16:04.512, Speaker B: Thank you guys.
00:16:04.608 - 00:16:04.944, Speaker A: Thank you.
