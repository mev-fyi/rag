00:00:07.640 - 00:00:18.634, Speaker A: All right. Hi, everyone, I'm John, this is Tom. We're working with Backpack. We're at Coral and. Yeah, so we're both developers.
00:00:18.934 - 00:00:20.554, Speaker B: We're both developers, yes.
00:00:21.094 - 00:01:07.172, Speaker A: I'm going to talk through what Tom's doing on his laptop. We're going to show you how to build an Xnft. But for anyone here who doesn't know what an Xnft is, we'll just give you a very brief rundown of how to set up backpack. So, yeah, firstly, we're an open source repository, so you can go to GitHub.com Coral XYZ backpack, and then we have a releases page. So one thing to note is we've been giving out invite codes to people who are like really good at our waiting room games and they managed to get the answers right. But everyone here has a cheat code.
00:01:07.172 - 00:02:00.184, Speaker A: You can go to the pavilion and we've got a booth there and we're giving out invite code. So if you go and find the backpack booth, there's a QR code you scan, they'll tell you what to do. We're going to use a local build. And the thing that's different about the local build is you're getting features that aren't in production yet, so you're getting the latest and greatest stuff, but you won't have the username stuff and you're definitely going to want the username stuff in the next few weeks. We've got a lot of things coming around the corner. So yeah, use the edge build locally if you need to run it locally for now, but I recommend you get an invite code. So Tom's just going to download the build edge version and then to install it, you go either in Chrome or brave, you want to go to Chrome.
00:02:00.184 - 00:02:46.434, Speaker A: So instead of like HTTP extensions, and once you're in there, there's a toggle at the top, right, and you enable developer mode. So now we've done that, we can get the zip file we just downloaded, unzip it and then drag the directory onto there and boom, you've got backpack locally. So now, yeah, once we click there, Tom's just pinned it into the extension bar at the top. Recommend doing that because otherwise you'll have to keep opening it up. So if we go to create new wallet, we're going to create with the recovery phrase. There's not going to be any sol in here, so try stealing it. But there's nothing to take.
00:02:46.434 - 00:03:19.574, Speaker A: Click next. And yeah, this is one of the big features of backpack right here. We're multi chain. So already we're sporting Ethereum and Solana, obviously, today we're going to talk about Solana's stuff, but we're constantly going to be adding new blockchains to it, as well as being able to run X nfts on the different blockchains. So we agreed to turn to service next and we're set up. So now we've got backpack installed. You'll see there's three tabs at the bottom.
00:03:19.574 - 00:03:41.294, Speaker A: It looks like a standard wallet view. Right now. That's what you expect. You've got your balances, but this middle tab, this is our special one, this is our secret source and it says no xnfts, so that's sad. So we should go and have a look at the XNFt gallery. And if Tom connects backpack here. So this website is just Xnft GG.
00:03:41.294 - 00:03:57.414, Speaker A: So now we're connected. So what can we do at this point? Well, basically, it's like a store of, like, all the xnfts. Everything is free right now. We're going to have creator royalties, all these things, but it's still very early, so, yeah. Which one should we show?
00:03:57.954 - 00:03:58.546, Speaker B: Flappy bird?
00:03:58.570 - 00:04:14.534, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the most popular one. Tristan tried to show flappy bird. Technical gods weren't playing along, so we're hoping they'll play along with us. So there you go. That's an insanely fast flappy bird. I think our high score is about three on this.
00:04:15.074 - 00:04:15.786, Speaker B: It's not easy.
00:04:15.850 - 00:04:35.404, Speaker A: We wanted to make it challenging, and as you can see, Tom's popped it out as well, so he can browse the web and stuff while he's using it. The other thing to note is, at the moment, we're recording the scored locally, but with the username system, we're going to have high score leaderboards, we're going to have invites, a whole sort of multiplayer gaming lobby, basically.
00:04:36.584 - 00:04:36.944, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:36.984 - 00:05:31.370, Speaker A: So we've done that. Now, the next thing we want to do, if you have backpack already installed and you had an invite code, you'll see that when you're on the XnfT page. There's an app on there called Simulator, because we're using the latest and greatest version that hasn't been approved for the chrome store yet. We have this toggle that we switch on, because the simulator was confusing some users who aren't developers, so they're like, what is this simulator? So we put it in the settings, you go into preferences and then developer mode, and then you toggle it on, then close that, go back, and now we have an Xnft installed. It's a simulator. Okay, so what's the simulator? Basically it's something that runs inside backpack, and it's watching like one of your local ports. We use port 9933.
00:05:31.370 - 00:05:58.844, Speaker A: Completely arbitrary. It's just the port that we all had free. You'll be able to change that if you want, if something's on there. But what's cool about this, we've got a ClI. So if Tom writes and everyone that's got node installed can do this, you won't have to download things and install them. You literally write mpx, xnft, init. And Armani did a tweet where he just wrote this LFG.
00:05:58.844 - 00:06:17.124, Speaker A: So that's the name of our project. So we're just going to go with it. So yeah, that's installed. So great. So now if we go into the directory, the LFG directory, and we, we run what it tells us to. So, yarn, you don't have to use yarn, we're just using yarn. It's in our project.
00:06:17.124 - 00:06:50.812, Speaker A: Yarn installs all the dependencies. This is pretty like, I apologize if there aren't technical people here, but you'll be able to see what's going on. So yeah, once that's installed, we'll be able to run yarn dev. And what yarn dev will do is essentially run like our xnft locally on a port. But it has hot reloading. So as you make edits to it, if you've used any react or vue or svelte frameworks, you'll be very familiar with hot reloading. So that's running now.
00:06:50.812 - 00:07:24.114, Speaker A: So if Tom now goes back to the simulator and opens it, hello world. Yay. The classic developer. So, okay, great. We've got like a really, really boring looking window here. Like, there's nothing particularly interesting, but what's the interesting part? Well, we can start to make some edits. So now we're inside this xnft context, we can actually fetch the user's public key or their username.
00:07:24.114 - 00:07:58.498, Speaker A: And we don't need to install any third party dependencies yet. So we don't need to install Solana web3 j's, or if this is an ethereum XNFC, we wouldn't have to install ethers. We'll just have everything provided directly in. And there's like a few reasons for that. Like one of the big ones is to simplify the development experience. But another reason is just if these APIs and things change, if everyone's using like the same sort of thing when they have to upgrade the xnfts, hopefully it will all work. So.
00:07:58.498 - 00:08:18.602, Speaker A: Oh, Tom has changed it to hello, Lisbon. I missed that. That's cool. So, yeah, I mean, another useful thing to have in this xnft is the public key. So we've created some custom hooks here. We've put use public key. So let's see if this pops up for us.
00:08:18.602 - 00:08:37.490, Speaker A: I mean, it's not the most exciting thing yet, but we're getting there. Bim under pressure, everyone. Okay, cool. So that's our public key. So now we have a public key. Like, we know we're, like, connected. The context is all fine.
00:08:37.490 - 00:09:31.714, Speaker A: If we changed our, if we added, like, another wallet inside backpack, it would have the other public key when we're inside it. So we can do a lot of stuff with this, obviously. I think the first thing that we'll do is sign a message, maybe. So message signing for anyone who's not familiar, it's a way of proving that you saw a message and you said, yeah, I agree with that in its simplest terms, but because it's cryptographically, it's a cryptographic proof, basically. It's a way of guaranteeing that the person that did see that and say, yeah, that's, that has that address, they have the private key to that address, but they don't need to give away any of that technical detail. It's just a secure way of doing things. So we actually use this message signing in the background when you sign in with your username into backpack because we don't want to store anyone's password.
00:09:31.714 - 00:10:01.784, Speaker A: We don't want to have any sort of leak news or anything like that. So, yeah, we just use this message signing. So Tom's now made a button. And here you can see we're using window xnft Solana signmessage. So if we were using ethereum, it would be window xnft ethereum. We're going to try to have, like, consistent APIs. It's still fairly early days with this stuff, but now if Tom clicks sign.
00:10:01.784 - 00:10:54.404, Speaker A: Okay, so what's happened here? We haven't created any of this API, any of what you're seeing now in this xnft. This is actually backpack. So this is rx Nft talking in the background to backpack saying, I've got a message to sign, I want you to sign it and then come back to me and ask the user to approve it. And this approval part is very important because we don't want people to create, like, I don't know, like scam X Nfts, where it's doing things on behalf of the user without the user knowing. So every time we do something like this, it's going to present up to the user and say, oh, like this, xNFP wants to do this. We're hoping like in all cases, like it's something that the users clicked. I think this might only come up from like clicks, but once click, once Tom sees this, he can either say, okay, no, I don't want to do that, I'll cancel that.
00:10:54.404 - 00:11:17.630, Speaker A: I'll give it a terrible review on the App Store. I don't know what it's doing. Or he can approve it. And yeah, basically once you approve it, you'll be able to do like login systems, you'll be able to do gaming high scores. You could do like Dalvotes type things. The other nice thing with just message signing is it's instant. So if we're doing this on Ethereum or some other chains that have got longer block times, we can still do some instant things.
00:11:17.630 - 00:11:23.834, Speaker A: So I think the next thing we said, are we gonna do a payment?
00:11:24.694 - 00:11:26.054, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
00:11:26.214 - 00:12:11.958, Speaker A: So Tom's just, we're gonna make simpler APIs for this too. But Tom's just a bit of a legend and he's gonna write the codes to, to generate a new payment. So you can imagine, again, if this was like, I don't know, some sort of like social chat up or it was a game or something and you wanted to be able to integrate payments into it, you'd write a few lines of code. Tom's doing great. So, yeah, once this comes up, basically he's going to click the button, it's going to say, do you want to send a payment? I mean, it's one lamp port. It's a minuscule amount, but it demonstrates. So there you go.
00:12:11.958 - 00:12:18.174, Speaker A: So this again, we've not imported any Solana. Oh, we have at the top, actually.
00:12:18.254 - 00:12:19.518, Speaker B: Just the Solana types. Yeah.
00:12:19.566 - 00:12:39.004, Speaker A: So yeah, we're going to fix that. But yeah, so once this goes through, that would actually send a payment. Payment. And it's approved the transaction and it's gone through. What were we going to do after this one? So we're both developers, we're not going to make you something pretty. I'm sorry. Like we should do something.
00:12:39.044 - 00:12:41.284, Speaker B: We need to direct them to the docs in the.
00:12:41.444 - 00:12:41.740, Speaker A: What?
00:12:41.772 - 00:12:43.724, Speaker B: Sorry, the docs, the documentation for the.
00:12:43.804 - 00:13:37.446, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. So if you go to XnFt GG, if you're interested in doing any of this stuff, we have a docs page at the top, it's just on the header. Everything we talked about here is in there. You'll see that our API that we use for the react X NFt stuff, it looks very, if you've used react native or react refiber or something else that uses react through the reconciler, which is you're not just saying like Dave or h one or something like that. We have custom elements and the reason we have these is because we know it's like very early with backpack. We don't know what the future holds for us, but we do want everyone to come along for the ride. So if we decide like oh, Backpack's gonna have like a custom theming solution, people are gonna say I want all my stuff to be pink or something.
00:13:37.446 - 00:14:29.282, Speaker A: Or we just think, oh, like backpack doesn't look right at this size, we're gonna make it bigger. As long as you've used these custom elements that we provide, your Xnft will automatically adapt and adjust with us. So it's always going to look like it's part of Backpack. So yeah, we definitely recommend the react xnft route. We're looking to support other frameworks as well. But there is one other way that you can run an xnft if you want to just get something up and running super quickly, or if you have like an existing service and you think oh yeah, it would be cool if I could, I have like say a big one for us is games. So a lot of people like, okay, I've got this game, it's like in a unity web player, I can do the JavaScript, I can talk between Unity and JavaScript, but I don't really want to have these like custom components.
00:14:29.282 - 00:15:23.374, Speaker A: So we made this like little helper for the XnFt CLI and if you run, can I get back up again? Yeah, so if you run MpX Xnft dev space and then dash Dash iframe, and then you just put an iframe URL in there, like we don't recommend this route, but it's good for games. At the moment we're still working out like the best way to do games. But yeah, Tom, if you open that, you'll see that Xnft is like embedded a game. This is an open source version of Crossy Road. That Tom sucks. Yeah, it's on GitHub, but yeah, any kind of game and stuff you can imagine what this would be like or any other kind of game. Like we were playing Pac man earlier, what else were we doing? We're doing like calendar apps, anything's kind of open to it.
00:15:23.374 - 00:15:27.134, Speaker A: Yeah. Was there anything else?
00:15:28.194 - 00:15:42.164, Speaker B: So there's also the publishing flow. If you end up producing an Xnft, you can go through a publishing flow on Xnft gg to get it listed up here so people can discover it and start using it. I think that's all we've got.
00:15:42.204 - 00:15:56.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that wraps it up. So we've got a discord. If you come to either the booth where we're at at the main pavilion, we're just in the front on the left. Come and get your invite code, come and get your username. You're going to want one of those. Soon. Soon.
00:15:56.824 - 00:16:14.584, Speaker A: We've also got, like, an NFT collection coming out and that would be very useful for that. That's all I'm saying. And, yeah, any questions or anything, either look for us, look for Armani or Tristan or any of the backpack people, and we'll gladly help you out. Yeah. Good luck, everyone.
00:16:14.704 - 00:16:15.024, Speaker B: Thank you.
