00:00:03.560 - 00:00:25.250, Speaker A: All right. Is this thing on? All right, perfect. Hey, everyone, why don't we kick things off with just a quick round of introductions? I guess I can start. I'm Colleen, part of the team at the foundation working on ecosystem growth, and I have the pleasure of getting to work with the social ecosystem on Solana, people who are doing awesome stuff for creators and. Chris, you want to go next?
00:00:25.422 - 00:00:25.706, Speaker B: Chris?
00:00:25.730 - 00:00:42.934, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey, everybody. Thanks for coming. My name is Chris. I'm the founder and CEO at dialect. Dialect is a web3 chat platform with superpowers. So just like the other traditional chat platforms, you can send and receive messages and DM's group chats, all that.
00:00:42.934 - 00:01:18.294, Speaker C: But because we built from the ground up for crypto, we can do these things that are not previously possible. And quick teaser, our users have minted millions of collectible chat stickers that you can truly own, created by some of the best creators on Solana. And you can trade them in DM's, you can collect them kind of like out of these foil packs. It's been, like, insanely fun for our users. The in DM's trading is powered by a thing called smart messaging, and that is an open protocol that we think can completely transform the way that we message.
00:01:20.314 - 00:01:58.704, Speaker B: So I'm Nigel Eccles. I'm CEO and co founder of Vault Music. Vault Music is a new digital music format that is built on Solana, uses Metaplex NFTs. What we actually do, and the inspiration for it was we've been working with artists for several years, and one of the things that really surprised us was that a lot of artists, a lot of artists of all scale, don't really do that well out of streaming. And what we saw was they were making money from merch t shirts, caps. You were like, this is crazy. Why aren't you selling your music? But no format existed that they could actually create, that they could sell directly to their fans.
00:01:58.704 - 00:02:32.670, Speaker B: And so what we created with Vault is a format that allows an artist to create a deluxe version of an album or a single and then sell that directly to their fans in a limited edition. So it might be only 100, 200 of these. What their fans get is they get unique, often unreleased music from these artists that no one else can listen to. If there's 100 of them, there will ever be 100. Only the owners of those vaults can listen to it. And so they get something unique, but they also have ownership of it because it's fully built on the blockchain. They can gift it to a friend and they can resell it.
00:02:32.670 - 00:03:03.354, Speaker B: Additionally what it does is create this new connection between the artist and the fan, and something we've actually created, and we're just launching at the moment, is this fantasy record label format, which allows the fans actually to put together a roster of five artists as if they were a record label. And then we score those artists every week based on their performance on Spotify, on monthly listener numbers, and then give rewards, both cash and points, to whoever's got the best roster. So that's something that's actually in development right now.
00:03:03.934 - 00:03:04.334, Speaker D: Cool.
00:03:04.374 - 00:03:30.144, Speaker E: And then, yeah, I'm Adam. I'm one of the founders of Standard Crypto. We're a us based venture firm that's only investing in crypto, as the name implies, for a bit over a billion dollars in terms of assets. And we've been quite active within the social space. So we're investors in Audius, which I believe actually is the largest on chain social network today. Also part of the Solana ecosystem. We're also investors in Farcaster and then Telegram.
00:03:31.964 - 00:04:03.560, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Viksit, founder and CEO at solar Plex. Solar Plex helps creators establish ten x better relationships with their audience than is possible on traditional social media. And we also provide them ways to make money using methods that are not ads. The way we do this is we've created what we are terming as social marketplace for digital content. But what that really means is allowing people to, you know, today, things are basically separate. Social media is separate. Marketplaces for content are separate.
00:04:03.560 - 00:04:34.414, Speaker D: And as I think we've seen before, the only way content creators can monetize today is by selling random drop shipped items on TikTok. They have absolutely no way to actually get digital content in front of their audience. And Twitter doesn't help. Twitter, in fact, penalizes you if you put a link to a marketplace. So we're leveraging crypto and the Solana blockchain to connect these creators to get better relationships and then monetize them in a way that you don't need ads for.
00:04:35.874 - 00:04:53.550, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, it's quite the panel we've got in front of us. But before we talk too much about web3 social, I wanted to get your takes on what's wrong or what's missing with social media as it exists today. I think we've touched on some of the themes here. There's something on monetization, but if people.
00:04:53.582 - 00:05:01.686, Speaker B: Want to chime in Vester viewpoint, oh, man, it's got the high view down onto all the applications.
00:05:01.830 - 00:06:14.072, Speaker E: Well, I appreciate you passing to me as a successful founder, but yeah, look, I would say I think that there is really a lot of different opportunities for innovation. I think one is that we've never seen money potentially so natively integrated in acquisition mechanisms and in retention mechanisms. And I think that, right, even to what you're speaking about with some of the challenges in existing social networks, monetization for creators is really, really challenging. So figuring out how to construct that in a sustainable way that isn't just something that makes growth hockey stick up and then quickly drop off. Because I think in many cases a challenge is that the half life of a token pump is a lot shorter than the half life it takes to set up a network effect. I think more concretely, people talk a lot about users actually owning their data, and I think that there is a possibility where we can set up new types of social networks where users are actually economic participants in a way that they've never been before. And I think that's probably something Nigel's talk about.
00:06:14.088 - 00:06:56.918, Speaker B: Yeah, I think just to follow on that, like a lot of the issues we see in social network, mainstream social networks today are really driven by the fact that it's free and advertising supported. And so we then go down to like, the surveillance economy and all of the issues we see with Facebook and meta products. I think crypto introduces monetization in a good way, or can introduce monetization in a good way, and that you actually can monetize these products directly. And I think, as Adam says, it also can help solve that kickstart problem, which is no one wants to join a social network, it has no users. But what have I said to you as being an early user? You're also an economic participant in this network. That's the promise. Now, that's incredibly hard.
00:06:56.918 - 00:07:25.050, Speaker B: And something we talk about is what are the products that have used that early economic incentivization to incentivize, get to scale, and then successfully remove the economic incentivization and stay at scale. And there's very few, like, I think Ethereum is one example that has done it. You know, there's arguably some other products, but that is a very, very hard thing to land. But that's the promise. Totally.
00:07:25.082 - 00:08:26.184, Speaker A: I mean, one thing I'll just sort of, plus one is the point I think Vikshut made earlier around these platforms being exceptionally existing social media platforms, being exceptionally good for building an audience, but exceptionally bad for actually making money. And crypto as a thing that sort of fundamentally enables money to be created and used. It sort of feels like there's something there and so that's definitely a topic I want to double click on in a little bit. But one of the hardest things about social media networks is getting them started. And so I'd love to hear from each of you around tactics that you guys have tried that have either been successful or haven't worked in sort of getting activity rolling on the platform. We're going to set aside the speculation and monetization piece for a second, because that, I think, is a whole topic unto itself, which I think there's a lot to say about. But that aside, what have you guys tried? What's worked, what hasn't?
00:08:27.644 - 00:08:55.787, Speaker B: I'd say some of our experience. So prior to building vault, we had another product called Flick. We actually built a chat product on the bit cloud now, Daso protocol. So, like, I. You know, I've been pretty agnostic about building on different blockchains. I think we gravitated towards Solana because it was fast and cheap and it had this vision of being fast and cheap at scale. But we built on Deso before, and one of the challenges that we saw with Deso was it tried to build horizontally.
00:08:55.787 - 00:09:31.902, Speaker B: It tried to be the everything product, and I think that's incredibly hard. Now. There already are horizontal products like Twitter or Instagram or Facebook that serve loads of different communities where I think people have seen more success in. What we're trying to do with vault music is to focus on involved music. We're much more focused on small independent artists or small and mid scale independent artists, where we can build a critical mass of fans and artists and build community that way. That's where I think people have seen more success. Whenever you go horizontal, I think that ship has sailed.
00:09:31.902 - 00:09:41.894, Speaker B: I think really anyone's success now has to start within a niche and really crack that and deliver value there. And potentially, if that gets scale build from there, but it has to be in a niche.
00:09:42.314 - 00:10:10.618, Speaker C: I would strongly echo what Nigel said. We think about user acquisition in two ways. I don't think either of these is specific to crypto. Number one is if you're building a social network, the best thing you can do is start with a single player experience and the best web. Two social networks did this in their own ways, or many of them did. Classic examples. Instagram gave photo filters basically for the first time on mobile, and a lot of people showed up to get these.
00:10:10.618 - 00:11:09.578, Speaker C: Great first time that your phone ever had a good picture come out of it. Part two is a little more complex and actually follows on this what's wrong with social today? And it's like startup founders are often encouraged to go and talk to users, find out what the problem is and fix it. And when you ask people what the problem in web two social is, they're going to tell you, oh, I'm the product monetization. All these other things, surveillance state. But I think if you clone that product, if you just make what exists today and just decentralize it, or try to disintermediate the value accrual between creators and consumers, that's not compelling enough. Point number two is anytime there's a disruptive new technology, we need to find genuinely new experiences and genuinely new modes of interaction. Like early Internet looked like newspapers and like magazines you could flip through early Apple products, whatnot similar.
00:11:09.578 - 00:11:29.974, Speaker C: We need to find the non skeuomorphic and create genuinely new experiences. And I'll just say for us at dialect, we haven't figured that out yet. Typically you have this incredible new piece of technology. You start pattern matching to what you've done before, but the goal on us is to iterate and find that net new experience so single player and just different than anything you've seen before. And that I think is like.
00:11:31.074 - 00:12:39.314, Speaker D: So we have a slightly controversial pov on this at solar plex, because we think that social graphs are actually irrelevant going forward, because TikTok has proved that it's not who follows you or how many people you have who follow you, it's what you're interested in that actually rises content to the top. And if you think about what it is that interests you, you are a function of who you're with, you're a function of what you see. And so rather than a social graph, which is purely around people, I think it's closer to an interest graph, which is the things you've done, the things you've seen, the things around you. And I think from that perspective, we are closer to a taste graph, if you will. And the way we think about acquisition for if you're building a taste graph, is really how do you put people who may not know each other in a same community, but have similar interests? And I think that's what we define as a community, which says you are a bunch of people with similar interests. You may not be directly connected, but because you are very closely matched interest wise. And being part of that same community allows you to do something which you couldn't do earlier.
00:12:39.314 - 00:13:04.034, Speaker D: And it's funny that almost all social media systems today are all individual focused. They're not community focused. And so if you think about communities and interests, our focus has been bringing people together around those two things, and we found that really interesting. We're early days yet, but I think for us, that's a very promising angle of attack towards user acquisition that we think is at least showing some dividend so far.
00:13:04.374 - 00:13:46.234, Speaker E: Yeah, I can maybe take a very orthogonal angle as well, which is, I think when you look at how social networks grow, there's actually one demographic that's typically more important than all the others, and it's girls aged 13 to 17. And it sounds kind of funny, but you look at the development of Snapchat, you look at the development of TikTok, of course, you see that driver. And I think, I don't know what the tactic is for crypto, but I will highlight that a lot of the apps that we're talking about are very, very unrelated to that core demographic that's historically been really, really strong and social. So it's super interesting to see how that changes the target. Or maybe this is even what breaks that trend.
00:13:47.254 - 00:13:56.270, Speaker B: Some exceptions, like Discord, where you've got a very intense community. But, yeah, you're right. For generalized apps like Instagram, Snapchat.
00:13:56.462 - 00:14:03.238, Speaker E: I would argue even for Discord, there's a very, very large populace. It's just slightly different from the core discord. Gaming.
00:14:03.286 - 00:14:05.634, Speaker B: Definitely a younger demographic. That's tons of free time.
00:14:06.554 - 00:14:08.494, Speaker E: Maybe sports betting will be next.
00:14:08.874 - 00:14:33.070, Speaker B: I don't know. It's interesting within music. So my last company was Fanduel, sports betting and fantasy business. My new company vault is obviously in the music vertical. It's interesting. Over the last, I'd say, ten years, Spotify has obviously been phenomenally successful, but Spotify has actually been phenomenal failure. At every attempt, they try to do it social, and you can go through them where they actually had all these different social initiatives.
00:14:33.070 - 00:15:10.630, Speaker B: None of them worked. And one of the things that I do wonder is one of the reasons why Spotify and social just doesn't work, is Spotify actually has created a real disconnect between the artist and the fan. And the list of music that you have on Spotify is you don't really have ownership of it anymore. You don't really have a connection with it anymore. And so I actually think that that actually has created a problem that, you know, there isn't that social network, because they say, oh, here's just a bunch of music that I listen to. It's not music that I own and have a special connection with. And it's funny, 20 years ago, Steve Jobs stood up on stage.
00:15:10.630 - 00:15:28.202, Speaker B: Now he was selling iTunes. He was selling music, and he said, fans want to own music. We've done all our research. They want to own music. They don't want subscriptions. And a lot of people now are saying, oh, he was wrong. I actually wonder whether he maybe still is right, is that fans do want to own music, but the MP3 format wasn't the right format.
00:15:28.202 - 00:16:11.774, Speaker B: They actually wanted to own it. You don't own an MP3. It's a license from the label for you to play it, but you can't resell it, you can't gift it to a friend. And I think social potentially comes back around ownership, because socially think in the real world or not in the real world, but in the physical world, was I have this record collection. People come around, I show, and we talk about the music that I'm really into that doesn't really exist with Spotify, but could it exist in music if I had a forum? And that's what we're trying to build a vault where I have a collection of music and you can look at it and go, how the hell do you have that? There's only 50 of those in the world. And it's like, well, I was there right at the start, you know, I was one of those really early fans. So that's what we think that social could come from, that ownership.
00:16:11.774 - 00:16:23.872, Speaker B: And that's what crypto's really strong at, is ownership. But it's. So if we need a strong community, we need of people who've collected something, that are intensely loyal to something, and that's where community comes from. Yeah.
00:16:23.888 - 00:16:28.712, Speaker E: I mean, you're almost even pointing out, right, that in the olden days, it was about distribution.
00:16:28.808 - 00:16:29.304, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:29.424 - 00:16:40.080, Speaker E: And for, you know, Spotify, this was the first time users could get an unbundled version of all these everything together. But now the purpose is social first, not distribution first.
00:16:40.152 - 00:16:40.408, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:40.456 - 00:16:43.416, Speaker E: And that's what's letting you build an entirely new experience.
00:16:43.560 - 00:16:45.044, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
00:16:45.664 - 00:17:27.151, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's an interesting sort of collection of strategies, if you will. There's a piece around interests being the common thread, not necessarily social connections. There's maybe a question of which demographics do you focus on, which type of fan do you have? Like a ten x better unique thing. That's what you're referring to, Chris. The other, actually, I think this was Dan Romero at Farcaster, who had an interesting observation that new social networks often see the most early traction from attracting people who don't have a following in the existing ones. If you're sort of not big on Twitter, maybe I can be big on dialect, or maybe I can be big on solar Plex and they try to make a name for themselves there.
00:17:27.151 - 00:17:50.284, Speaker A: So maybe that's an audience to focus on as well. So we talked a little bit about user acquisition, but I think now let's get to the fun topic, which is, what do you guys think about the speculative tools that crypto offers to onboard users? We've seen this used quite effectively for a short period of time by Bitcloud, for a more extended period of time now by Friendtech.
00:17:50.824 - 00:18:20.850, Speaker B: I said, they're following quite similar trajectory. Oh, interesting. Yeah, yeah. I was early on BitCloud, and I think it was around March 2021, it had an early pump, it then subsided, then it had a later pump, and then it started declining. And once it started declining, it really does. Its death is inevitable. And Friendtech, if you have dug into it, has actually got exactly the same bonding curve as bitcloud.
00:18:20.850 - 00:19:08.080, Speaker B: Its really big innovation was it gave utility to owning the token and bitcloud didnt have that. With Friendtech, you own the token and only then can you get into the chat. But the bonding curve is exactly the same. And so when I got into Friendtech and I thought that was really great innovation, but when I saw the bonding curve, is the game the same, I was like, the outcome is inevitably the same, in that the bonding curve is problematic, because what happens is it drives the price up of being at that group, but the only people buying are speculators, and the only reason they're buying is because they think it goes up. If it stops going up, then they will sell, then everyone will sell and it collapses. And that's the stage we're in on fran tech at the moment, but pretty much the same timeline, a sort of two to three month kind of period of boom and then decline.
00:19:08.272 - 00:20:15.598, Speaker D: It's interesting you mentioned that, because we've talked about financialization of social networks, and crypto sort of leads the way there, right? It's all about financialization, but we've often thought about at solar plex, what if you could apply bonding curve mechanics not to tokens, but to content? Like the first edition, Abbey Road LP is worth a lot if it's unopened, right? The only reason it's worth that much is, first, there's a scarcity of that. But also, second, the Beatles are so big. So if you think about a bonding curve applied to content and, say, as the trajectory of an artist gets higher and higher, and their rare and early aspects of content becomes much more scarce, the value is controlled by a bonding curve and whoever can figure this out in a way that is also able to sort of socially mint it or marketplace, whatever that is. That to me is a really interesting use case of the sort of speculative game dynamics without it being the primary use case of a social network like it has been for bit cloud and friendtech and all these, because there's really no lasting content that gets created. So we're thinking about that a lot actually, to see how we might be able to implement some of that.
00:20:15.686 - 00:20:48.344, Speaker B: I think bonding curves are fascinating to play with. My question is, can they create something that's more of a social utility than like if you think of, remember the hot potato games, like where you basically would sell the NFT on at a fixed price and then eventually somebody would end up with a very expensive NFT and nobody wanted to buy it from them. So that's kind of what the bonding curve creates. And I think it creates a very fun speculative game. The question is, can it create a fun game that translate into like a usable product? And I don't. Have you seen one?
00:20:48.764 - 00:21:10.204, Speaker E: Well, I mean, I guess the truly cynical view, right, is money has always had product market fit and always will have product market fit. So I think, right. If people can make money from speculating on something, they absolutely will. And I think the point that you're highlighting, I absolutely agree with, which is that that can really juice acquisition, but it doesn't really do anything for retention.
00:21:10.324 - 00:21:13.512, Speaker B: Yeah. In fact, it might actually. It hurts retention. Yeah.
00:21:13.528 - 00:21:44.560, Speaker E: It makes it sort of out of an equilibrium state where then when things start going down, they really go down. And the challenge to solve is how do you make the core product loop actually drive that long term? Because in many cases you have this thing that has a lot of monetary activity, but is a really small social network by outside standards, and it's really hard to have that drive. The inherent utility when the user base is maybe, you know, one 100th of what it would be if it was not a crypto based application, like I certainly.
00:21:44.592 - 00:22:24.524, Speaker B: And one of the things with frantic, just move on but a moment. But so the way frantic works is on a very sharp bonding curve. Every token goes, is it more and more expensive? And I think the hundredth token is something like 20 times more or 100 times more valuable than the first one. And then secondly, the creator or the host of that group gets revenue as a percentage of each trade. And what I figured out what that actually does is it incentivizes the host to pump and dump. Because, for example, instead, what if the host said okay, I'm going to create a great group, going to give it tons of value. I'm going to get this up to like 200 people and then that's going to be my 200 people.
00:22:24.524 - 00:22:57.794, Speaker B: I'm going to give them value, I'm going to give them value and then they're going to realize they don't get any income because there's no trading. So it inevitably creates a sort of pump and then a dump. And so I said, okay, well, I want to rebuild Frantech, but I want to make it a better product. And what I said, okay, I'm going to have a flat, flat er bonding curve. And instead of doing part of trading fees, I would take like 2% of TvL each month and give it to the creator. And so you made all these changes? And I went, okay, this is a much better product, but it sucks as a sucks perspective. Like it's just boring, right? You buy it, it goes up by like 1%.
00:22:57.794 - 00:23:03.046, Speaker B: And so you're like, no one would use this product. And so there's this really tough trade off there.
00:23:03.190 - 00:24:00.636, Speaker C: Yeah. The thing I would add to that is the conclusions we've come to. A dialect is like, don't tokenize, don't add speculation until you have product market fit. And like the best reward you can give your users is a product they love to use and they love to continue using, which is retention. And I think speculation is not only like mostly drives, let's say acquisition TBD on retention, but I would even go so far as to say when you add speculation, you can hurt retention and even hurt acquisition for authentic users. Anytime you have scarcity and there's some kind of clamoring to get that thing pure speculation, which we distinguish from what we think of as more virtuous speculation, which I'll explain in a sec that can cause sort of a crowding out. And if there's people who come and just buy up things for this pure speculative purpose, the authentic experience for the users is not there.
00:24:00.636 - 00:24:42.474, Speaker C: And so one of the things that we're hoping to see as we improve crypto in general is better infrastructure that maps to like, well, what other kinds of products and industries have had to fight with speculation in the past. That's games. And like, you look at the 30 year history of games, there are frictions to onramp in the like we have to protect against pay to win. You can still buy in to get certain things, but there are certain things that you inherently have to earn, and then there's a lot more friction to off ramp. You have these like siloed game economies where you might have an incredibly fun experience speculating. Like in Eve Online, you can create an entire experience for yourself. Play for like a decade.
00:24:42.474 - 00:25:25.034, Speaker C: Just being a trader, that's speculation, but it's authentic because it's a part, part of, of the game experience. Additionally, I would say you look at trading cards, which I think there's this meta flowing through crypto right now, that collectibles trading cards are. The next thing I open a foil pack of Pokemon cards, or magic of the gathering cards, maybe I'll get lucky. But most of the time it's net loss. We think of this trifecta of speculation can be authentic and it can be real, but it has to be in your universe. And then you need great ip and a great experience, which maybe we call that utility, and so it can serve this virtuous role. But I think we need to reconsider the incredible superpower of crypto.
00:25:25.034 - 00:25:48.806, Speaker C: This seamless financial rails allows for a kind of like, I don't care what the product experience is, I just want to buy up all the guns in CS go. And I'm a hedge fund and I'm just going to. And you can completely mess with economies that way. We think that even at the protocol level, how tokens are exchanged, how you create friction between different types of tokens, something that we think is going to be necessary for better consumer products.
00:25:48.990 - 00:26:22.208, Speaker D: I want to touch on the retention part for a second, because I think you mentioned that speculation can actually hurt retention. But if you think about people opening foil packs and things like that, they come for that every day. If you made it a daily behavior, which was what happens for a lot of games, for instance, which is actually a part of speculation, you come back, you come every day, you're like, I roll a dice, what am I going to get? And that behavior is actually really interesting because in some sense it brings you back, because a surprise element is there. Do you feel like that maybe there is actually a different way to think about speculation for retention in a way that actually helps not.
00:26:22.256 - 00:26:58.204, Speaker C: And we've seen this directly, this is a great question. We've seen this directly at dialect. And I'll come back to this trifecta that we think when I come back for that roll of dice, whether it's in dialect, because we do foil packs with these chat stickers or magic the gathering Pokemon, that is so much fun. But what I get out of it has great, I like to call it lore, but let's say ip, like great content that you love and you've fallen in love with, and then also some kind of experience around it. So I can take my cards and I can go play them, or I can, like the loot box in some gaming platform, I can go use those utilities. So, like, I think it has to be within the universe of content.
00:26:58.334 - 00:27:04.352, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I think maybe to even bridge what you two are saying, it's about understanding and developing the core user loop.
00:27:04.448 - 00:27:04.656, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:04.680 - 00:27:54.392, Speaker E: Because it's not speculation for the sake of speculation in a game where it's trading cards, literally, the core loop of the game is building your deck and getting better and competing with other players. So of course, that level of randomness and speculation is inherent. But if it's something that is a more generic social application, and now you've added a speculation piece on it, but that's sort of adjacent to the core product, it's hard. And I think in many cases, because of the incredible feel it puts on the fire of user ack, we see tokens and monetization get flipped on a lot earlier in social than we're used to seeing outside of social. For instance, there's a social app that I think probably everyone in this room is on, which is telegram. And their monetization efforts happen really, really late in the journey when they're well into the hundreds of millions of monthly actives because they were so focused on the core loop and distribution.
00:27:54.528 - 00:28:30.166, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a great point. Oh, sorry, I was just going to. The core loop thing is actually interesting because what we've seen over at Solar Plex is people creators issue reaction packs, which you can use in the core app. And when people come back every day to find new reaction packs they can then use, that actually drives a lot of really interesting dynamics. Like, we see new kinds of social behavior come out. Like, for instance, people were giving each other 420 bunk as the equivalent of a Facebook book because that was just a behavior that didn't exist before, but now it does. And I think things like that, which is basically speculation in some way, has been actually really interesting for us to see.
00:28:30.270 - 00:29:02.014, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of the models that we talk a lot about crypto or nfts, is sports trading cards. And sports trading cards really, really strong in the US, less so outside the US, soccer is getting more popular. I used to run a sports trading card business, and it'd be interesting looking at the history of that market because the original sports trading cards came out with cigarette packs in those baseball cards in the 18 hundreds to help sell cigarettes. They became very popular with kids. Eventually. They were like, maybe it's not a good idea to put them in cigarette packs.
00:29:02.014 - 00:29:23.932, Speaker B: And so then they became associated with candy, but so cigarette. So trading cards started off as disposable. There was hundreds of them or millions of. No one cared. And it took. What happened over time is then they started to become collectible among kids, right? They became. And then some of them were rare, and those somewhat became more valuable.
00:29:23.932 - 00:30:14.120, Speaker B: And over a period of about 100 years, they started to. And this is by the sort of the, actually the fifties, very famously, I think it was the fifties or sixties, topps dumped like a whole cargo of unused baseball cards in the, in the hudson because they couldn't sell them. And a lot of those were like Mickey mantles, really, really famous, really rare cards now. And part of the reason was because they dumped them off the coast of New York, but they basically went from being kids, collected them, but they weren't valuable to then becoming some of them became valuable. And so people started to say, well, actually, you could even invest in these. Those kids grew up, then they had more money, then they bought them, and they became sort of an investment. And what happened in the eighties is they went from investment to become an item of speculation, and then they absolutely skyrocketed.
00:30:14.120 - 00:30:47.652, Speaker B: And like, what happened with nfts was when there was so much demand, supply met demand and then far exceeded it. It's known as the junk wax era. So basically cards were making hundreds of millions and billions of cards, and then the whole market collapsed. And that actually happened in the sort of cycled eighties to early nineties, particularly with the baseball strike. Baseball cards came back in 2020 during COVID And the market saw like a sort of ten x uplift. Around 2020, same thing happened. Lots of people came into the market, and then the market basically turned in early 21 and then collapsed again.
00:30:47.652 - 00:31:31.108, Speaker B: But it's gone back to where it was, which is collectors, you know, long term people who just intrinsically love buying. What are these little pieces of cardboard? In fact, I remember arguing early in 2020, 2020 about somebody with an NFT, with a card collector, and he was like, why the hell would you buy a digital picture of somebody that's the most ridiculous? And I'm like, you spend literally thousands of dollars on pieces of cardboard, of men, of men and sports gear. And he is like, you cannot argue with me that nfts are valuable, are no value. But what we saw was what we've seen in nfts, which is a bubble and then a collapse. But there are still collectors. And we will see it start to come back again among some of these. Now, not everything's coming back, but some of them will have value.
00:31:31.108 - 00:31:37.824, Speaker B: But you need to have that core of collectors that just have utility and feel value in making that collection.
00:31:38.404 - 00:31:43.276, Speaker A: So if I heard you correctly, Nigel, my pfps will come back. It just might take a few decades.
00:31:43.340 - 00:31:46.340, Speaker D: If you were a good as cardboard pieces.
00:31:46.492 - 00:31:48.860, Speaker A: None of this is financial advice, let's be very clear.
00:31:48.972 - 00:31:49.664, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:50.084 - 00:32:34.174, Speaker A: Okay. So if I try to encapsulate some of the discussion here on speculation, it seems like what a lot of us agree on is that you should first ideally try to find some sort of meaningful product market fit core loop that's engaging. And then the speculation can be sort of an element that you add to pour fuel on the fire, but it can't be an end unto itself. And you definitely have to do it carefully. There's a lot of mechanism, design questions. Yeah, I think this is something like a area of study that we're going to see, hopefully a lot of development in over the next few years. I do want to use some of our remaining time to talk about another, I think, pretty broad topic in web3 social media, which is sort of the nature of open social graphs.
00:32:34.174 - 00:33:33.866, Speaker A: I think it's interesting. People will complain that, hey, Facebook sells your data, but that's actually not really true. In fact, the most valuable asset that Facebook has, or Twitter has is your data, and they guard that extremely tightly. And what they sell is access to target people using that data, but it's never the data itself. And so for them, their monetization, advertising, targeting is all based on having their privileged view of understanding the people in their social graph with web3 social protocols. A lot of this infrastructure is going to be built on an open database, in this case Solana or ethereum or whatever. And I wonder, how does that change the nature of this business? Because if all of the social information is fully readable and open, what does that mean? Or maybe you could argue that actually it's not going to be fully readable and open on chain.
00:33:33.866 - 00:33:36.018, Speaker A: But I'm curious how you guys think about this topic.
00:33:36.106 - 00:34:40.092, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for me specifically, it goes back to, there's a few things here, right? One is, as you said, the only way to monetize right now for social media companies is to use ads and sort of have a moat for all this data. Web three flips this on its head because of, I think, three main reasons. The first one is web3, and crypto is primarily around sort of your interest, you know, if you buy an NFT, if you buy a mad lads, you're now part of the mad lads community. That's an expression of interest, right? If you mint something else, or if you buy, buy a piece of music at vault or whatever it is, that's an expression of interest. And this interest graph is available on the chain. What's not available is a compressed version of this that can be used by companies to sort of target you, because you might have used wallet one, wallet two, it's very sparse, right? And what we think is going to happen is sort of what I call sort of the taste graph or the taste vector, if you will, which actually feeds really well into what we think about as personalization. Your taste vector is basically a sum of all the stuff that you're interested in.
00:34:40.092 - 00:35:29.630, Speaker D: And this is aggregated on chain, but it could be using zero acknowledge proofs. And ultimately the data is available for anyone to use but you, the user, now control it, which means for the first time, you authorize Facebook to use your data. And not that Facebook says, I'm just going to use your data for whoever, and we hope that you like what we offer you. So the fact that it inverts it, is really interesting. And this is really interesting for creators, because, for one, not only do their audience now have an interest expressed in that creator and this data is available, but now creators get to establish a really interesting direct relationship because they are no longer bound by the platforms that have so far held this data in their moats. And this actually opens up a whole new line of business models that we haven't even begun to explain. So I think web3 truly can enable this stuff.
00:35:29.702 - 00:36:24.524, Speaker E: Yeah, and I think I totally agree with the ZK point, and I'll even extend. It doesn't have to be just the on chain part, all the off chain stuff, especially if you look at sort of the intersection of ZK and ML, could be attested to be part of a model, but never actually shared. And I think you also brought up a really interesting point earlier, right. About are they selling your data? I think what gives people the creepy feelings around privacy being broken is really about the compounding. If you think about it right now, TikTok, Facebook, etcetera, they have really, really good models on you because they touch a lot of different surfaces that you engage with every day. And I think the most important thing about this ZK feature you laid out is you can actually stop others from compounding, and you can have the most compounded model and you can allow others to query it from or a payment, but never actually get the inputs. And I think that's what's really special and different.
00:36:26.064 - 00:36:54.514, Speaker B: Yeah. One of the things I think is really interesting, when we look at Facebook and Google, we look at what they are and think about what they are. Could be in context of web3 is Google and Facebook are basically these huge companies that sit between brands and customers that basically solve this matching problem, which is me as a brand. How do I. So for my example, in my last company, Fanduel. Fanduel spends over a billion dollars a year in advertising. That's to acquire users.
00:36:54.514 - 00:37:38.100, Speaker B: Where do they spend most of it? Facebook, Google, and obviously tv advertising. But they spend it because that's the only way they can actually get to that customer. The really interesting thing is, in web3, is there a way actually not to have that? Like, could I take that billion dollars? So, for example, co founded a company called Betx two years ago, which is a sports betting exchange. They're looking at this marketing problem. They can't spend money with Facebook or Google. They won't take ads from crypto protocols. What if we could take that money and instead of giving it to Facebook and Google, which won't take it anyhow, what if we could actually directly give that to the users? And that's actually somewhere we've seen web3 really work things using tokens like Airdrop.
00:37:38.100 - 00:38:20.116, Speaker B: But I don't think. I think the problem at the moment is you're dealing with like, are you giving it to the right users? Are you going to get like a bunch of Sibyl attacks and people farming? But the problem and the opportunity is still there, which is instead of giving it to these third parties for matching, how about I just take that money and give it directly to the right users, the people who would be users of my protocol. That's something that I think we've seen the early stages of. And I think there's been a lot of success with things like airdrops that have driven, but there's also created lots of problems. But I think that, to me, is fascinating in that that's something that can only be done in web3. Like, you know, I'll give you another example. You know, you get a letter through the post from Amex who said, this is the offer I give you.
00:38:20.116 - 00:38:48.564, Speaker B: They have only very vague information about who I am. If I can look in somebody's wallet, I can know an amazing amount about that person. I could say that person, you know, what protocols they use and the level of targeting you can do in web3 is so detailed. So I actually think in web3 there's an opportunity not to have Google and Facebook's, but actually protocols and projects can reach directly to users. And instead of putting all that money into the marketing department, actually just giving it straight to the user.
00:38:51.064 - 00:39:52.870, Speaker C: I think there's some really interesting points here. I think the thing we at dialect grapple a lot with is the question of the social graph and is it open, is it closed? We have not seen yet that there is actual aligned incentives across the multiparty system to actually create a business use case, a free market use case for creating an opensocial graph. And I also really liked your point, Vix. It might not be literally who's following whom, it's this bread crumb trail of your behavior on the Internet. And if we can do that with privacy enabled where you permission, that to me is like the future of social graphs. I think that's super fascinating. The only time I feel like I've really seen like someone really deep in an existing social network express a desire for an open social graph, or like an interoperable one, let's say is the least are like influencers with a lot of followers where they feel platform risk, but your average user is not really going to care that much either.
00:39:52.870 - 00:40:42.104, Speaker C: And then when we talk about the value prop of this, I think the value prop to your average consumer, if you say there's millions or hundreds of millions or billions of people on a social platform, there's not a really strong value prop to them. I hear sort of like second and third order value props of like, oh, I messaged this person here, I can now message them there. Or like my ad targeting is better, let's say. So I think the problem that we face at social, like media in just this next wave of social, crypto or otherwise, is like you have to build something so different and crazy and just like absurdly fun that people flock to it. And I see sort of like an open social graph is not that value prop. And so it's likely, as I see it just empirically, that like if you're grinding to create that unique experience, you're not also sort of like building some giga brained open social graph. There's like not enough time as a startup to do both.
00:40:42.104 - 00:40:56.754, Speaker C: So we have the like kind of pessimistic take that it's not going to be open. And that's why I'm encouraged by what vixit was saying, that it's like this breadcrumb trail and as long as that infrastructure is permission so that we really own our data, that's like the future I get optimistic about.
00:40:57.254 - 00:40:57.670, Speaker D: Totally.
00:40:57.702 - 00:40:58.486, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:58.630 - 00:41:52.516, Speaker D: I think from our perspective, we at solar plex, we think about social as a marketplace of two sided marketplace, right? It's creators creating content and there's consumers looking at that or consuming that content. And we've gone away from the old facebooks of the world where people shared their college photos and things on social media. Now it's happening on closed groups. Social media has evolved into sort of entertainment first. And in some sense, I think just sort of what you said, Chris, is basically, should that be open? I think that the answer there is yes, which is your interests and your sort of breadcrumbs should be open and available to other people to build upon. Because that's the only way that you can provide more entertaining experiences. Because right now, everybody in the world waits on the PM responsible for the next feature at large, social media company x, to figure out the next interesting thing.
00:41:52.516 - 00:42:15.794, Speaker D: But actually, if everything is open and permissioned, but necessarily not permissionless, anybody can make that innovation happen, right? And I think of a future where somebody could come in, build a really interesting app that you could then just connect your interest graph to, or interest vector, whatever you call it, and just fly off of the races, because that's your distribution mechanism and your personalization mechanism.
00:42:16.454 - 00:42:47.290, Speaker A: Yeah, it is a super interesting topic. I mean, I do take Chris's point. In some ways, openness to me is like decentralization. It's like a benefit that for most people actually is very abstract and means basically nothing. It does mean something to a few people. So in this case, I feel like it's relevant to the advertisers and brands who are spending a ton of money because they don't have access directly. And then the mega creators, the mister beasts of the world, who have platform risks because their livelihoods are so tied.
00:42:47.402 - 00:43:00.134, Speaker C: If I can add a point to that, we think about it. Advertisers and brands, you got to build something that's going to get users. Then those people come. And if you can design aligned incentives, that's sort of like the sequencing that we see there 100%.
00:43:00.554 - 00:43:32.034, Speaker A: With the two minutes that we have left, I did want to ask the panel, we've got a lot of builders in the audience here today and in Amsterdam in general. What are things that you want to see built to help enable social media? I think Viksh had an interesting one around. It seems like there's a lot of ZK, so that people can opt into being part of targeting your models. Is there other pieces of infrastructure, tools, things that we need to study to help sort of move the ecosystem forward?
00:43:33.894 - 00:44:23.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll make a shameless plug to the thing I hinted at earlier. I think like the superpower that crypto has that you have seamless financial rails, everything is interoperable, is necessary, but I don't think it's sufficient. I think we need to build better systems to sort of broaden bring in authentic users. So like if a product can have what is like an in game economy in its experience, and then we can take the decades of learning that we have from the gaming industry and actually be able to allow free economic exchange in that pod and then look at the best in Defi these days in terms of like how do you off ramp, off of curve, like lockup periods, all this other stuff, building that at the infrastructure level? I've personally like developed a lot of conviction on this. We as members of the community haven't discussed this with a lot of people. So if that's interesting to you, we'd love to chat. Maybe the last point is if you're building in consumer just make weird stuff.
00:44:23.090 - 00:44:37.722, Speaker C: The next thing that's going to take off is not going to take off because it's crypto. It's going to be this break the skeuomorphism to web two, and it's just different and strange. And I think we're just beginning to see stuff like that, but it's just going to be unexpected and just wild and different.
00:44:37.898 - 00:44:40.904, Speaker D: It's interesting you mentioned that because for me it would be on the other.
00:44:40.944 - 00:44:42.392, Speaker B: Extreme of that spectrum, it would be.
00:44:42.448 - 00:45:07.314, Speaker D: The most fundamental thing we're missing today is onboarding people into blockchains is so hard, asking them to install a wallet, getting that 1st $0.01 so they can make a transaction. All of that needs to be really abstracted away. We're making some progress now. Some teams in the audience are building sort of pass keys. They're building different mechanisms of signings on Solana. They're building interesting wallet apps that are custodial but on chain.
00:45:07.314 - 00:45:36.902, Speaker D: But I think what we really need is an app that when somebody uses, doesn't even look like it's a crypto app, it should be a regular app. You sign in with your email, with a password, and you're good to go. How do we make that happen? Because I think that is a fundamental blocker to even the narrative that exists of crypto being very scammy. And how do we change that? Because to your point, if you're going to get somebody who's a teenager right now to get into this, they're not coming in for speculation, they're coming in for entertainment and talking to their friends and there's no way they're going to figure out the technology on their own.
00:45:36.998 - 00:46:10.692, Speaker E: Yeah, and I'll give a really quick one as I know we're over time. But what I was going to get to earlier is I think instrumentation, as simple as it sounds, is just missing in crypto for social understanding what it actually costs to acquire users tokens are not actually free. They may be free in some ways, but there's a trade off being made. Understanding how cohorts look, understanding user behavior on other chains, user behavior on other apps within the same ecosystem, and so on. And so I think this is in many ways limiting how to think about acquisition and retention today.
00:46:10.788 - 00:46:32.788, Speaker B: Yeah, my two just wrapping up would be one would be instrumentation, like giving me the ability, like from vet tech's perspective. Let me look at people's wallets, let me see who's using other teams. We can target those users. I was stunned at high poor. The infrastructure is there. And the other one on the total opposite end of spectrum is more weird stuff. Like, these are really interesting tools, even things like bonding curves.
00:46:32.788 - 00:46:52.600, Speaker B: I think we've only scratched the surface. What they can do, make some of the. And most of these are going to fail, but unless we try hundreds and thousands of different things, we're not going to have new products. And so I just would love to see more interesting economic games, more speculative games, to see which are the ones that actually have really have legs and. Cool.
00:46:52.752 - 00:47:00.776, Speaker A: Awesome. Sounds like we need some extremely weird stuff and then we need just like the least weird normal things possible, but nothing in between.
00:47:00.840 - 00:47:02.764, Speaker B: Barbell strategy. Yeah, totally.
00:47:03.504 - 00:47:06.752, Speaker A: All right, thanks all of you for spending time with us today.
00:47:06.848 - 00:47:07.384, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:47:07.464 - 00:47:08.184, Speaker D: Thank you. Thanks.
