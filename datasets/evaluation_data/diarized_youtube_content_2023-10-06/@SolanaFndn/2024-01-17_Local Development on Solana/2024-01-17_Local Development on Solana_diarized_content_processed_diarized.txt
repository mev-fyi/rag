00:00:00.240 - 00:00:18.566, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Having a local setup for your Solana development is very beneficial, and it's actually not that hard to do. So you just go to your terminal and type Solana test validator, and it starts your local cluster. See, it's producing blocks already. And then you go to the anchor terminal and set your cluster to localnet. And then you deploy your program there. And then you can even clone certain programs from Mainnet.
00:00:18.566 - 00:00:44.166, Speaker A: So in this case, the metadata program from Metaplex in case you need it in your program, this is how you do the same thing from the terminal. Then you go to JavaScript and set your connection to localhost. Then you go to the Solana explorer and set it to localhost. And then you can directly look at your locally deployed programs and accounts. And you can also even use phantom Wallet. Set it to localhost, and then you can use the wallet adapter to directly connect your apps to your local cluster. And another nice thing is you can get tons of Sol.
00:00:44.166 - 00:00:49.646, Speaker A: So you can see I have 500 million Sol already. So try it out and make your local development a little bit easier today. Bye.
