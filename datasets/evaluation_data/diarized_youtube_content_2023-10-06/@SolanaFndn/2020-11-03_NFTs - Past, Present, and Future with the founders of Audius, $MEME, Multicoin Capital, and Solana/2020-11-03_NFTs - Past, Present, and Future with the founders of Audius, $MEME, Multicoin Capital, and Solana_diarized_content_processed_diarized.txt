00:00:09.720 - 00:00:44.522, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone, to the 6th event of the Solana wormhole hackathon. We have a really exciting panel today revolving around nfts, the past, future, and present. And we have a handful of individuals that are thought leaders within the space for this specific topic. And so we have Jordan, who is the founder of Meme. We have Reneal, who is the founder of Audius. We have Kyle, who's a managing partner at Multicultural Capital. And then we have Anatoly, as usual, who is the co founder of Solana.
00:00:44.698 - 00:00:45.498, Speaker B: And so this is going to be.
00:00:45.506 - 00:01:14.324, Speaker A: About a 45 minutes discussion. Any questions you have during the panel, just drop it in the questions tab we have on the right hand side, and we'll take the last 1015 minutes, and these speakers will take turns answering the questions appropriately. And then we have the chat channel, which is just kind of free for all. I see several folks already making use of that. Just feel free to use that during the chat for just overall discussion. And I think with that, toli, I'll let you take it away. Have fun, everyone.
00:01:16.824 - 00:01:43.476, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you, Austin. So there. Really good to have you guys here, as usual. I'm in San Francisco with two kids under five. Let's jump in on all the meetings. I'd love for you guys to give, like, a little deeper kind of dive into your project, especially like, meme and Audius, which I'm super excited about.
00:01:43.476 - 00:01:46.304, Speaker C: Audius just announced integrating with Solana.
00:01:49.384 - 00:01:52.644, Speaker D: Yeah. Jordan, you want to go first or. I'm happy to start.
00:01:53.384 - 00:01:55.164, Speaker B: Well, you had the big news today, so.
00:01:56.544 - 00:02:40.806, Speaker D: All right, so, yeah, just the super quick high levels. Audius is a decentralized audio hosting and streaming protocol. We help artists connect directly with fans and distribute any music they want in a kind of a community first and community owned way. And, yeah, so we launched Audius about a year ago now, September 2019. Today, we actually just crossed a million monthly users, which is pretty cool. It's also pretty cool was to help us scale into this next chapter. We announced this morning that we're migrating a large piece of the audius system to Solana.
00:02:40.806 - 00:03:10.524, Speaker D: So pretty excited about that, too. We've been hitting, I don't know if any of you all have been using Audius. You may have been hitting some of the issues over the weekend from POA network being backed up. So I have a lot of thoughts on why this intends all that good stuff. But, yeah, ultimately for us, we are a protocol that serves our users, who are primarily artists and listeners. Yeah.
00:03:12.264 - 00:03:26.084, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. I'm super excited and sorry to, like put the spotlight on reneal, but that was pretty big news for us. Jordan, I'd love to hear your like, kind of how you got into crypto and like, how meme, where meme came from.
00:03:27.464 - 00:03:44.668, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Thanks. Happy to be here. So I'm a product guy. Several startups with exits been building full time on Ethereum since 2017. So about, about three years. And I'm currently at consensus.
00:03:44.668 - 00:04:22.770, Speaker B: Actually spend the last year and a half at consensys building products and defi. And then a couple of months ago, this crazy train started rolling, called Meme. It was an interesting origin story. We can dive in if we want, but really it started from a satirical tweet that I had posted and then that kind of turned into a community that just kind of took off and ran with this concept. So it's community first, it's meme first. It's just hours within the start of this crazy community. A few of us said, hey, let's actually build something.
00:04:22.770 - 00:05:15.152, Speaker B: Rather than just being a silly meme, token, let's go build a product. If we're the dogecoin of Defi, let's actually be a Lego brick in composability terms. Let's go actually build something. So within ten days of inception of this community and token distribution, we launched our first product on Mainnet. And it was really just an experimentation. What happens if you mash up the best of defi and the best of NFTs? Jam them together? What do you get? We pioneered this concept of NFT mining or proof of, you know, NFT proof of work, NFT farming, where you lock up assets instead of staking to earn governance tokens, you're staking to earn the exclusive limited edition NFTs. And it kind of took the place by storm.
00:05:15.152 - 00:06:12.264, Speaker B: I think it's at least partially responsible for this defi times NFT kind of bump that we've seen the last couple of months. But yeah, it's been a couple of months now and it's taken up more and more of my time and it's kind of turning into this platform where we're able to, with like the mechanics of Defi, we're able to engage the user. Rather than just an NFT artist selling to a few whales, right? They can engage the community, the users can come to our site and really participate in the staking process and this minting process where they're really connected to the audience, or, sorry, the audience is connected to the artist. And we're kind of uncovering some of these cool kind of new interactions between, like, web3 primitives and NFT art. And we're kind of seeing this platform being built, and we're right in the middle of trying to figure out what's next for the project, and we're having a lot of fun doing it.
00:06:15.084 - 00:07:02.094, Speaker C: That's awesome. I mean, like, I love how the space is transforming, like, the world. I think, like, you know, consensus and, like, layer one, L2 stuff. Those are implementation details. I think, like, the really powerful thing is this idea that humans now have, like, access to cryptography and they can now, like, do all of these things just with cryptography alone. Like, this idea that I have a secret that I can sign with, I think is. Is incredibly transformative because, like, for myself, vantage point, you know, NFTs are, like, implementation of, you know, copyright law in a sense, or, like, a lot of the ways that we deal with art and ownership of it and, like, monetizing it and giving access of it to, like, humans.
00:07:02.094 - 00:07:25.494, Speaker C: Right. It can be all self contained. And with cryptography, it's super cool, like, super cool to see these, like, experiments and, like, the awesome progress, like, folks like reneal have done and, like, actually getting users to use this stuff. Right. Which is hard. Crypto is freaking hard to get people to use. Kyle is, like, one of our investors.
00:07:25.494 - 00:07:48.764, Speaker C: He's one of our investors in audience. I don't know if he's an investor meme or not. Right. But he's been, like, our, like, go to, like, help us with any problem and, like, pound the table for Solana and kind of an awesome, like, part of the team effectively. So it's awesome to have him here. I'd love your take on the NFT space.
00:07:50.904 - 00:08:25.154, Speaker E: Yeah. So there's, like, a lot of really interesting things to do with nfts. The thing that I'm, like, really excited about is to figure out, like, how do you use it to make things more engaging. Like, there's some fundamental value of scarcity and, like, enabling creators to use that scarcity to engage their, like, customer base or readership base or listener base or whatever. Like, fundamentally makes sense. You already have lots of inklings of this in music specifically. Like, all the major artists have, like, fan clubs and stuff.
00:08:25.154 - 00:09:21.492, Speaker E: My sense is they are all executed generally pretty poorly. But, like, they, like, try and do, like, limited edition things and stuff like that. If you can introduce an NFT into that kind of, like, a workflow and feel like there's something there, and then if you can embed that scarcity, not just in, like, I email you something, an email newsletter, but like, into some piece of regular software that users use on some recurring basis. Like, that's very interesting. Like, one of the common ways to think about applications is like, is this application single player or multiplayer? And Spotify and Apple Music have tried to make it multiplayer over the last decade. Apple, the ping and Spotify did sort of spam your feed with what your friends are listening to, and it turns out they just did a really crappy job at making it multiplayer. But I feel like NFTs might be the right lens to make these things multiplayer.
00:09:21.492 - 00:09:30.764, Speaker E: And if that theory is correct for music, I suspect you'll be able to replicate similar types of ideas to other content form content mediums as well.
00:09:35.104 - 00:09:42.004, Speaker C: I don't know if anyone has, like, a response to that, but, like, I. I used to make really terrible music in college.
00:09:44.704 - 00:09:52.884, Speaker D: And when's it dropping on audience. Audience account?
00:09:53.704 - 00:10:19.220, Speaker C: It was like, literally I was, I was trying to make. It's called like, industrial noise, right? Like, so it was a bad choice to mimic and then a bad implementation of that. But the, like, the cool thing was that I was like using these tracker software and just pulling MP3 s from the Internet of random stuff and plugging it together in a sequencer. And like, I.
00:10:19.332 - 00:10:19.732, Speaker B: It's.
00:10:19.788 - 00:10:45.960, Speaker C: That's like illegal and impossible to do. Right? Like, that's absurd to me that we don't have, like, software systems that would allow, like, content creators to, like, share this stuff in such a way that somebody like anybody can just kind of remix it and easily, like, create a new work and post it on the Internet and like, have all that monetization. Monetization, like flow through. Right. Not like naturally, it's like a. A dumb billing problem. Right.
00:10:45.960 - 00:11:01.244, Speaker C: Like we're building billing software. Right, right. Like, effectively. Like, it's absurd to me that that's impossible. Like, do you guys, like, like in the near term, do you guys. What do you guys see as like, transformative use cases coming out of your work?
00:11:03.784 - 00:11:05.604, Speaker D: And, Jordan, why don't you go for it?
00:11:06.624 - 00:11:51.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's really interesting. We're starting to just kind of scratch the surface of kind of what's possible. I see this NFT art. It's really just a narrow piece within like the whole NFT landscape. But I think it's becoming like this bridge to mass adoption. Right? Like, I really think nfts as. Just as a general technology, it probably won't be called that in a couple of years, but just like this provable ownership and provable scarcity of digital content is going to be bringing on millions of users from web two to web3, whether that's music with audience, or collectibles and art and everything else that we've got up our sleeves here at meme, it really does a few things.
00:11:51.540 - 00:12:45.958, Speaker B: It smooths out kind of the user experience where you, instead of having to jump through all these hoops and participate in some of these what are currently known as defi mechanics of locking up assets and staking tokens and participating in liquidity, providing and all that stuff, it really just makes it super easy. I think, like, things like Solana and other like, layers on top, like what we're trying to build and what audience is doing, just makes this whole thing scalable and accessible to a brand new audience. And I think, like, ownership of digital anything is like, we're brand new to this space, right? But it's. You go back to like, a fundamental human need to hold something and own something, and he has something I want. So I'm going to go. I'm going to go take that or I'm going to. I'm jealous because he has that and I don't like this.
00:12:45.958 - 00:13:23.554, Speaker B: This comes down to, like, basic human primal needs of like, owning things and being part of like a status. A status symbol. Right. I don't mean to dive too deep into that, into that, but it's. But it's really, it's really interesting to think about that this tech now allows us something that almost should have existed last, the last wave web two year. But yeah, it's really exciting to put this power in the hands of users, being able to do things that we weren't up until now able to do. And that's almost like even a more fair model for paying artists.
00:13:23.554 - 00:13:32.394, Speaker B: Community engagement, like we've discussed, it's really powerful tools and I think we're just starting to uncover some of these things.
00:13:34.354 - 00:14:24.804, Speaker D: Yeah. To kind of add on that, I think it is interesting to think about what is the definition of an NFT or what is your definition? Because I think a lot of folks have a lot of different perspectives on this. I think the angle that we've seen artists get really excited about and that audius we're really excited about are, I guess there are two angles. One side is sort of these, like almost like non financial style use cases. Think of almost like trophies or like membership in a fans fan club. What if you could earn a token for being a given artist's number one fan in a given month, for example? There are all these different almost earned assets, if you will. That become this reflection of what's been done.
00:14:24.804 - 00:15:22.790, Speaker D: You almost get back to the concept of trophies in gaming, for example, right, where the transferability of it is actually, it's like, not meant to be transferable, right. Because you can't transfer, like, if I'm the biggest user of or listener of so and so's music, like that, I can't, like, transfer the fact that I was that to someone else, right. It doesn't really make sense. And then there are the, like, very financial aspects of it. And where I'm really interested to see folks double down is, I don't know if you all saw, like, Rac's NFT that he sold recently on super rare. Like, what a fantastic way to monetize work for an artist. But what if you could actually start to tie further sort of rights or intangibles to the ownership of that NFT? What if you, the owner, were the only person that could listen to it? And then when you transfer the NFT, you transfer that ability to listen to it to someone else.
00:15:22.790 - 00:16:05.084, Speaker D: What if you could attach a royalty stream to it? Like, there are so many different things that I think, like, we have yet to explore as a whole community that, like, that's where I think this stuff gets really interesting. But what makes me excited is to see kind of this. Like, I feel like we're just beginning to scratch the surface. And, you know, the. I think our job as builders in this community is to give artists the tools and see what they come up with doing with them. Right. And I think that's what I'm most excited for, is just seeing that, like, explosion of experimentation and probably a lot of really novel, like, cool ways to share content and monetize content and.
00:16:05.084 - 00:16:38.284, Speaker D: Yeah, so I guess I almost have started to think about these two lanes, like, separately. I don't know if you'd even call the kind of trophy community token management kind of angle like an NFT. I have heard some people call it that. I've heard some people not call it that. And then there's kind of these, like, actual, like, financial assets that are, you know, there maybe there are a lot of different tracks. Each track is its own unique thing, though, and they follow some, like, schema and characteristics, but then they also might have, like, other rights attached to them.
00:16:42.784 - 00:17:35.765, Speaker C: This is like, to me, like, seems like programmable, like, you know, part of software eating the world story. Like, we're making, like, programmable copyright mixed with automatic billing like, systems, which just sounds really boring, right? Incredibly boring. But I think the implications are awesome. I think, like, memes themselves have been proven to be extremely powerful, especially in the space. But I don't know if you go back to in history and time, I feel like the Soviet Union was brought down by satire, right? Like, by, like, the middle class constantly, like, making fun of the government. And there were a ton of memes that were just pretty viral on the absurdity of, like, life there. Do you, like, is it.
00:17:35.765 - 00:17:50.104, Speaker C: Do you think that, like, that's something that could kind of seep into crypto or is it always going to be kind of, like, speculative? Like, is it going to be more than just the kind of the value of it, like, ownership more than financial to it?
00:17:52.204 - 00:18:50.156, Speaker D: I think so, at least, yeah, I think that's what makes art so interesting is the cultural impact of it. And even the way that art is sold and transferred, for example, also has cultural impact to it. Even if you think about in traditional art land, the importance of curation and curators in creating value in art, I think is. Yeah, so, yeah, I mean, I think it's actually, like, I hope we don't all lose sight of the fact that, like, the reason this stuff is cool is because when we look at it or when we hear it, it, like, makes us feel something. Right. That's, that's like the point not, not to, like, have 15 layers of, you know, financial indirection, you know, I don't want, like, a cdo of, like, you know, nfts that are generating revenue in the future or whatever. Right.
00:18:50.156 - 00:19:08.292, Speaker D: Like, that's. I think if we trying to reduce this to, like, a purely financial thing, we're just going to miss what's most interesting about it, you know? And don't get me wrong, all that stuff is cool, but, like, that's not the point, right? That's like the, that's like the icing on the cake. That's not, that's not the cake, you know? Yeah.
00:19:08.308 - 00:19:29.112, Speaker B: I think we're seeing it at meme, right. Even with people that don't know exactly what the mechanics are behind staking. And maybe I'm going to. As a user, I'm a collector of art. My favorite artist launches off the meme platform, and I don't know what staking is. I don't know what an LP token is, but I need to get that art. It's exclusive to the platform.
00:19:29.112 - 00:20:24.196, Speaker B: So they're like, buying into the idea, the meme, so to speak, before they even get the value. And I mean, that's what crypto is at its early stages, right? Bitcoin is digital gold. Ethereum is the world computer. Like all these things, it doesn't make perfect sense, right, if you try to pick it apart. But it's really just a short phrase that gets people excited about the vision on the meme side as well. Like we're having artists that are creating individual pieces, individual nfts, and works that they could probably go sell for a few each directly, if not more tens of thousands of dollars and sell directly to whales. But they're, they're kind of taking a risk here and taking a step of faith that like, I think you're onto something here with this, like this level of community engagement that I wouldn't get anywhere else.
00:20:24.196 - 00:21:08.918, Speaker B: So I'm willing to put some, put some art in a staking pool and benefit from the long tail, benefit from the indirect value of community engagement, generating hundreds of new fans, and then go sell on an auction where you might recoup some of that, some of that money. So I think people are buying in and we're seeing that with the users. And we have an interesting mix of like Defi dgens that want to capture the alpha, right? They're going to go farm this NFT and go sell it on Opensea and that's great. And returns are actually really good. And then you have people that are like, wow, I'm an NFT guy. I'm experimenting with Defi. The first time we're really seeing some interesting, interesting things, like at this crossroads.
00:21:08.918 - 00:22:04.924, Speaker B: But it all comes down to this idea and everyone knows that, like at the end of the day, the value of provable scarcity. And I have something that there is still some kind of warm and fuzzy. We are seeing some people that for the first time, a meme NFT is the first NFT that they've ever owned. And it's really exciting to talk to somebody like that, to talk to our users where this is the first time there's an NFT in their wallet and they get it and they're excited and they go and they start buying some of their favorite artists, exploring the rest of the art space. Then they're excited about this tech that could be done on other forms of media and getting into audience and things like that. It's really a cool community to be a part of, especially coming from Ethereum, Defi product builder space, to get involved in this NFT and more broadly this art community. It's really refreshing.
00:22:07.934 - 00:23:04.224, Speaker C: I like, I really like that perspective. And even on the financial side, I think it's almost that that stuff will happen. But what's cool about that happening is that it's replicating the real world, but in a kind of a flat, transparent way that, like, although all those, like, weird credit, like, swaps exist from movies and large music productions, but they're inaccessible to everybody else. That's not, like, in the inside, but, like, as soon as those protocols are available, I think, like, anybody can use it. This is, like, a question for Kyle. Like, do you guys, like, can you guys, like, value memes yet? Like, is, like, is this, like, brand valuation, or is that, like, possible? Like, I mean, it's obviously, like, has huge impact. Like, look at, like, link, right? Like.
00:23:07.264 - 00:23:43.544, Speaker E: Yeah. So I think so. It's an interesting question. So I think, like, there's companies that have done, like, the study of, like, what is the brand worth? Like, I think, like, big audit firms or whatever, and they're like, the Coca Cola brand is worth $50 billion. I've never looked at the methodology of how they calculate that. My assumption is that they look at, like, the current earnings of the company. They, like, subtract out, like, some estimate of, like, what they think the company would otherwise earn if, like, the brand was just, like, neutral and, like, not significant.
00:23:43.544 - 00:23:54.944, Speaker E: And then, like, the discrepancy is, like, the value of the brand. I think that's kind of how you, like, run that math. I'm not sure, but that's my intuition on how you do it.
00:23:56.204 - 00:24:02.504, Speaker C: How do you do that? Sugar water is basically free, right? So, like, Coca Cola is purely the brand.
00:24:03.324 - 00:24:03.700, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:24:03.732 - 00:24:03.948, Speaker D: Right?
00:24:03.996 - 00:24:11.980, Speaker E: Like, that's kind of the argument, right? Maybe you have to net out, like, some advertising costs or something, but, like, the calculations a little more complicated, but something like that effect.
00:24:12.172 - 00:24:43.944, Speaker D: So, like, I think it's also, like, the supply chain and the consistency of the product. There's, like, a. I think there's actually more there than people give it credit for. But, like, yeah, no, I mean, it is fair. And their ability to monetize the brand and the asset I think you're buying when you buy Coca Cola stock is, like, that distribution network, right? Not even they could push, like, so, you know, whatever they want through that. But they can distribute coke, like, anywhere in the world, right? So I think there's actually, like, more there there than people like to give it credit.
00:24:43.984 - 00:24:56.234, Speaker E: But, like, I'm not saying it's zero. It's just, like, how much of the total? $100 billion. I'm making this $100 billion. How much of that is brand value versus, like, operational value?
00:24:56.534 - 00:24:57.274, Speaker D: Fair.
00:24:59.134 - 00:25:55.994, Speaker E: So, like, how do we do time with nfts. My senses were like the long tail of nfts. It's like very hard to do. I don't know how you do that. I think you'll start to see, as you start to see creators experiment with nfts, I bet you there will become some way to come up with some sort of measure of like rabidness of fans because like let's say you have a million fans and let's say you've got like a thousand of them are rabid, right? Well like if you create 500 scarce things and just assume that 100% of the rabbit fans want it, so you've got like two x demand to supply, like what does that mean? Versus I don't know, like you have 10 million fans but only 2000 rabid ones. And like I don't know, like somehow like come up with some sort of like funny measure of these things. This is pretty loose but it's kind of the best I can come up with on the spot.
00:25:58.214 - 00:26:57.450, Speaker B: Kind of coming from like a product manager background. One of the things that you ask your users, right, to define product market fit. You asked the question how disappointed would you be if this product went away tomorrow? Right? That's kind of the classic, do people care about this thing? Is there a fit between product and market? I think that's kind of cool too because it's the brand, it's the product. It's the sizzle, right? It's the warm and fuzzies I get from using it. It's interesting in like this tokenized world because I asked all the users of our product and to use our product you need to be a meme token holder. So it's a little bit skewed but we're seeing some crazy numbers that with a background in product startup like I never seen. So you know, it's, what we've seen with like 1000 surveys is that two thirds.
00:26:57.450 - 00:27:37.774, Speaker B: So about 65% of our, of our users say they would be extremely disappointed if we were, if this product were to go away tomorrow. And usually you're happy with 20 30% right, in like a web two. So it's, so it's definitely skewed because if the product went away then the token value would decrease. So they're incentivized to answer that way. But it's still, it's still really interesting to kind of get that gauge from your audience to say, yeah, we're aligned with what you guys are building. Just kind of an easy kind of shorthand kind of way to figure out. And it is kind of skewed with the tokenization, but a cool way to see, like, are you on track with your user base?
00:27:40.754 - 00:28:26.176, Speaker C: I think, like, that's kind of brings up a really good point. And I've been thinking about trying to figure out how tokens fit into, like, just even product development in general. And my kind of guest feeling is that they're almost self selective for the users. Like, you almost like, get a better filter of the users that want yours. Like, they, it's kind of like, you know, like I can be part of a Bajillion Facebook groups, a bajillion Reddit groups. I can click, go to a million websites, but I have to spend money to acquire finite number of tokens. And if I already take this huge step to do this, I've almost already done all the research and self selected to be part of this community and group.
00:28:26.176 - 00:29:03.334, Speaker C: And, like, I think the engagement there is just much, much higher, right. Like, it's almost like I'd rather have, you know, 10,000 token holders than 100,000 people in a mailing list. Right. So I think that that's kind of a super interesting, like, mechanism even. And that is obvious with for NFTs as well because I do have to spend money and, you know, and I can only have a finite number of them versus I can be, you know, a friend of every, like, artist on, you know, Instagram or something like that.
00:29:06.594 - 00:31:14.476, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the, like, you know, any definition of NFT that has made sense to me includes scarcity, almost like, as a, like a core tenant, right? It's almost like the part of the value comes from the fact that, like, there aren't a ton of these, or maybe there's even only one of them, right? Like, and, you know, yeah, I think that is, I did not have, like, a proper appreciation for that before. Like, talking to some of the folks who, like, you know, buy these and play around with them, it's like, it's almost a, you know, like partly they want to support the artist, is what I often hear, but also it's partly like, you know, there's something really neat about the fact that, like, I am the only one that has this thing, right? I mean, it's the same way that when you, like, buy a painting at your house and, like, hang it on your wall, like, you are the only person who has that unique, like, sort of thing that was actually, like, touched and worked on by the artist. And I think what will be really interesting to see is like, you know, how, how much does that being digital and potentially like, reproducible change the sort of, I guess, the amount of value that can remain intrinsic in the asset. Whereas if I, I guess there are forgery issues and stuff with physical art, of course. Right? But like, if I sell you like a Picasso or something, like, you have to, like, you have to like, physically see the thing, right? It's almost like the physical incantation of the thing is what is valuable. Whereas in the NFT case, I think we will start to see people like, attach different forms of value to these assets, whether it's actual royalty streams or maybe you could get a share on any future resale that happens on it. That would be a way to incentivize curator communities to form that can buy lower priced art and through their curation, increase its value and capture some of that.
00:31:14.476 - 00:31:29.744, Speaker D: I think seeing all of that play out is going to be really fascinating. And I imagine it won't look like all that different from the way that normal art in the real world is created and sold and resold and managed and all that kind of stuff.
00:31:33.844 - 00:32:04.128, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like, there's some, I don't know if you guys read stuff about, like, art auctions, but there's been some crazy, I guess, backstories, which seem a lot worse than what happens in crypto. Um, I think a lot like, uh, crypto is probably like just a week. We see it more in the open, but it's probably less actually, like the, the bad things that happen in crypto are probably less, uh, bad than what actually happens in the real world, which isn't totally observable in a lot of ways.
00:32:04.256 - 00:32:14.674, Speaker D: Um, at least in crypto, we don't have the forgery problem, which like normal art and fine wine and all that stuff is like, massively problematic for them.
00:32:15.734 - 00:33:21.544, Speaker B: We're seeing some interesting fraudulent nfts that you go on a marketplace, you just upload our art, and you're able to trick and fool some people into download, into paying a lot of money. It's unfortunate, but yeah, certain platforms are open in that anyone can be a creator and, and sell their NFT. So working hard with some of these platforms to ensure that there's an authentic seal that we're informing our users to check, double check the contract address. And it's kind of funny that we're policing fraudulent and blockchain was supposed to help us solve this, yet we're taking this approach of forget about the, forget about the frauds, do, you know, go with us, or sometimes they'll just make a subtle change in our art. And it's like, well, the blockchain is supposed to solve this, but we're still having to do a lot of manual work to clear some of the fraud.
00:33:22.164 - 00:33:49.174, Speaker E: Yeah, the really interesting thing is blockchain guarantees on the back end, no double spending and scarcity and those things. But humans don't interact with cryptographic things on a blockchain. Humans interact with. And the screen can say anything. Like there's this weird subjective world that lives between what's on the screen and what's on the blockchain. It seems like that's kind of the source of the problem here.
00:33:50.154 - 00:34:48.058, Speaker D: I do think norms will emerge there over time in the same way that any legitimate contract on etherscan is verified. And you can go copy paste that code and search in GitHub to find it. I imagine we'll start to. And there's a whole war that is likely to play out here on who owns web3 identity, or if there's even a single owner. But I imagine there will be the equivalent of the verified getting attached to someone's wallet, address or wallet that they're publishing an NFT from, or publishing work in audience from, for example, or any of these things where you can start to trust that identity more. Like if you know that, you know, if there's the little check next to, like, you know, a Kanye west name or something, you can like, be pretty certain that that's actually Kanye west and not just some, like, random other person. It.
00:34:48.058 - 00:35:34.304, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's still like, one of the bigger unsolved problems in our space is like, how do we kind of more scalably handle Sibyl resistance issues? Right. And yeah, I think it's going to be really interesting to see. But until we have some norms like that, I think, Jordan, what you described is just probably going to keep happening. Nothing will stop it, especially when you can look in an NFT and pull the actual image file and do whatever you want with it. Or in the case of most of the audio stuff, the audio file is there. I think it's going to be. There's more work for all of us to do there, I think, to improve on these types of issues.
00:35:35.844 - 00:36:02.784, Speaker C: Yeah, for like, things that you can modify. It's kind of computationally challenging, but I think solvable because you can effectively do, like, first to file and like, do reverse image search or reverse audio search. And like, is this actually the first instance of thing in a blockchain? And that is a hard guarantee. You can't go back. You can't go back in the blocks or slots.
00:36:04.564 - 00:37:05.634, Speaker D: So I wonder if we'll start to have people almost like filing those hashes without the content yet to make sure that you can almost guarantee that. Hey, if I, I proved this data, I had this data and it existed like three months ago or whatever, only follow my thing about it. I think that is super interesting. I guess now that patents are first to file, this doesn't matter. But I know this was a blockchain use case a lot of folks had talked about previously. There were companies like Stampery and others from four or five years ago that were sort of like timestamping data mostly in bitcoin at that time. But like, you can just put whatever hash in op return, right? And be like, ok, we know that this data existed at the time that block was mined because you couldn't have come up with a hash otherwise.
00:37:06.694 - 00:38:11.212, Speaker C: This was like the first kind of demo that we built on top of proof of history, which is like hash this thing, like record this thing in like cryptographic time. And it's super boring, right? This is like trying to like implement copyright law and software. But I think the implications of this are really cool because of this flattening of like access, right? Like, anybody can do this and anybody can start kind of plugging into the sophisticated financial networks that are going to like, kind of monetize it. To me, that's important because like, as like artists, you know, I feel like artists and entrepreneurs are fairly similar, right? You take a lot of risk by spending your time on something, usually a vision that is ludicrous to most people until you're proven right. And then, like, you get to like, earn your rewards. And it's just like that. That hustle is hard, right? Like, and like, usually doesn't, like, actually bear any fruit.
00:38:11.212 - 00:38:20.664, Speaker C: So equalizing and removing the middleman, I think, is just a way to enable more artists to succeed, more entrepreneurs as well.
00:38:22.404 - 00:39:14.280, Speaker D: And I think the analogy could even go further than that. In most areas of art or in music, for example, there's a lot of resource expenditure that goes into developing art, too. Historically, fine artists had their patron that would support them or whatever. Then later, up and coming artists often were supported by galleries and curators who where implicitly their investment in resources was netting them a cut of any sales that happened in the future if they get sold via their gallery. In music, we have the label structure where labels are effectively investing in developing artists to recoup. I think it's actually kind of, you know, it almost to some extent, like what we all do in tech. Like, it's just borrowing from what's been done in art forever.
00:39:14.280 - 00:39:26.244, Speaker D: It's just like more transparently and directly monetizable, typically, and I mean, depending on your perspective, higher or lower risk, but yeah.
00:39:31.024 - 00:39:34.754, Speaker C: Are you guys with meme? Do you see it as like.
00:39:36.574 - 00:39:36.910, Speaker D: A.
00:39:36.942 - 00:39:41.154, Speaker C: Technology, an App Store, a platform for all of the above?
00:39:44.894 - 00:40:24.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I mean, the tech is probably pretty easy to reproduce. Right? It's all open source contracts that you can go grab. I think so much of it is as we're talking about the community, the meme, the brand. Right. But in terms of the roadmap and what I see is evolving into it is this App Store or this place for discovery of digital art, and not just art itself, but the creator. So we're kind of getting into more social aspects of connecting and engaging an audience with an artist or creator.
00:40:24.094 - 00:41:10.084, Speaker B: So there's a lot of thought around the App Store and the distribution side of it. And how do we promote certain artists over another? Right now we have this cadence of every Monday dropping a new artist, but eventually that doesn't scale. And at least our plan is to onboard many more. So it's just figuring out. It's the early days, but it's figuring out, okay, why do we promote this one over that one? We have to make it clear, because people are lining up to, to give us money to get their brand on the platform as well. So it's like, okay, we have to signify that this is more of like a featured or a sponsored campaign, so to speak. So we're dealing with some of that stuff right now.
00:41:10.084 - 00:41:34.554, Speaker B: And it's exciting because there are so many different directions this project can go, and it's really just finding one or two that we can just focus on and execute and provide a lot of value to the, to the ecosystem at large. So, yeah, we're right in the middle of figuring this out, and it seems to be going in the direction of connecting a digital artist, a creator, a brand, with their, with their fans.
00:41:36.694 - 00:41:38.766, Speaker C: Are you guys thinking about, like, Jordan.
00:41:38.790 - 00:41:41.926, Speaker D: Do you see there being like, oh.
00:41:41.950 - 00:41:44.514, Speaker C: Go ahead, please, go ahead.
00:41:46.694 - 00:42:19.714, Speaker D: I was just going to ask, like, do you see there potentially being like, kind of these almost like curator groups or networks forming to start to, like, you know, there's only so, so long that you can be like, every Monday we're going to put out. Like, at some point, will it be sort of like these different sort of subgroups form that start to curate work? And, yeah, I'm curious how you all are thinking about that or sort of scaling out that side, because we've been thinking a lot about it, too, and haven't formed, don't have, like, super wealthy formed thoughts there yet, but I think it's really interesting.
00:42:20.294 - 00:42:48.506, Speaker B: Yeah, it's super interesting. I mean, it goes back to just, like, creating on the blockchain in general. Right now, certain things are very centralized. We all hope that more and more become decentralized down the road. But, yeah, right now, it's almost like art curator is one of the hats that I wear or the small team that we've got that we act as. And of course, art is subjective. And what I find interesting, you may not, and that's kind of the beauty of it.
00:42:48.506 - 00:43:42.872, Speaker B: But when we are doing this, like, limited run one at a time, why are we launching this guy and why are we waiting for this guy? A lot of it will come down to that, and I think we're starting to get into, and we do things like this just, like, indirectly or off chain, where we pull the community. Okay, who do you want to see next? We do things like that, and in our kind of permission group, we call the Citadel, mostly as a meme. We put up for a poll which artists should come next. And we're in this space now of really prioritizing this guy's meme worthy or this guy's not meme worthy. It'll be great to have more of a platform that's turnkey that allow creators to. To kind of come in and submit on their own and then let the market decide. I'm looking forward to that.
00:43:42.872 - 00:44:16.014, Speaker B: To that day. In the meantime, we can do interesting things like gamify it a little bit, make it part of the staking experience, where let's say you've got three artists and you can see a history of their work, and then the one who gets the most meme staked in their pool, they become the featured artist of the day the next week or, you know, whatever. So we're starting to kind of scratch the surface there and figure out how can we get the community even more involved on the editorial side. Yeah, I would be interested in picking your brain and hearing what you guys are thinking about it.
00:44:17.194 - 00:45:25.006, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so far, we've really just been observing emergent behavior within audius, which is this network of playlists has started to form, and folks are following those playlists to kind of, like, be part of different kind of types of music or things like this. Like, there's a Atlanta hip hop playlist that someone in that community has been curating for a while, done really well. And there are a number of others. Like, there's a, like, the EDM production subreddit curates a playlist of, like, all of their users, you know, whatever they're producing there so they can all follow each other. Yeah, I think it's, while we. This isn't enabled in any formal way, like, in the audience, like, product or protocol, this playlisting kind of feature, I guess we stumbled upon some emergent behavior that, like, we didn't anticipate but has been really interesting to kind of watch evolve. And, yeah, I'm curious to kind of see, you know, I see a lot of parallels between kind of how you're thinking about this and how I've heard about, like, you know, I'm big fans of both, like, Zorai and foundation.
00:45:25.006 - 00:46:09.456, Speaker D: I think they're kind of, they're doing really interesting stuff. And the question for all of us is, like, how do we scale curation of culture effectively? Right. And either, do you, like, begin to silo things in the way that is naturally happening on Audius, which is where, like, different little groups are forming around playlists and things like this, or do you, I mean, is scarcity of the curation space almost more a feature than an issue? Right. That's. I think that's a valid question. Right. Like, maybe there's a world where, you know, they're, like, having a fixed number of drops just makes the ability to be one of those dropped more and more and more and more valuable over time.
00:46:09.456 - 00:47:13.744, Speaker D: It's almost like the Veblen good kind of effect that gets really interesting. We've always, with the product, tried to take the stance that our company should not be playing a role of curating, being the sole curator of content. But I think the natural emergent property without some, like, tent pole in the middle is, is really this siloing or fracturing of community, which I think has trade offs. And so far for us, I think we've, we've seen those as, like, good emergent properties, but it is, I mean, I think you just kind of have to be, like, cognizant of, like, what are the trade offs of any given approach and kind of, you know, almost, you know, we see it as a kind of, you know, are we need to, as a, as a community around audience, make sure that there is still, like, cross pollination happening between these groups. Right. Because I think that's where things do get, you know, that that is an important aspect of all this. Right.
00:47:13.744 - 00:47:50.244, Speaker D: But, yeah, so I don't know, maybe we'll start to see like the like culture daos form of tomorrow. The curator daos of different groups of just basically creating culture in a way that's the way it's created in the real world is when the taste making groups decide that they like a given thing or whatever. Sometimes it doesn't work, but oftentimes that is the thing that helps boost something that's niche into a more mainstream kind of view.
00:47:52.364 - 00:48:44.184, Speaker C: That is like, to me like one of the like kind of mind boggling transformative things about the space. It's like, like not just like how do you even like tell somebody that there's a possibility for like culture to be implemented with this like software cryptography stack, right? It's absurd, right? Like, but it is like, like all of these pieces seem like we're moving towards like the metaverse, right? Like, like do you guys think about like this as being like components of the metaverse? Like I almost, I believe that like these protocols and implementations are all going to kind of merge into this like global kind of experience versus like somebody building fortnight and we all play it.
00:48:48.504 - 00:49:44.834, Speaker D: I agree with that take, for what it's worth. I think that it is at some point we will start to see, I think, just what is the next platform that we all go to. We've been stuck on mobile for twelve years. Eventually something will come that creates, you know, the opportunity to rethink all the stuff that we've been taking for granted, right? Maybe that's AR, VR, maybe that's something else. I have no idea. I think whatever it is, it's far enough away that like, none of us, or at least I have like zero clarity on what it might be. But like, I feel like you almost have to like reset with like a new platform to have an opportunity to like kind of start, you know, to almost like rethink a lot of the things that, you know, we just have to take for granted in the current, like, you know, mobile web paradigm.
00:49:45.494 - 00:50:33.834, Speaker C: I think like, I believe the next platform is just the, you know, the elliptical curve space. Like it's literally like, it doesn't matter if it's mobile, web, Internet, Solana, Ethereum, some L2, right? What we're communicating with is like these elliptical curves. And there's some platforms that define scarcity for certain things, right? And some may be like data storage, like Arweave, some may be like high performance communication over scarcity, like Solana. But I think the key part here is the humans getting cryptographic keys and understanding that they have them and that they can basically communicate with each other. That to me is, I think, the next platform.
00:50:35.334 - 00:51:32.244, Speaker D: Well, I do think what was interesting with mobile was that our phone numbers all became like a quite an important identifier in a way that they were not before everything from there are so many mobile networks that were able to bootstrap themselves off of that identity. I do think a new user interaction experience paradigm emerging at the level of something like mobile is really the opportunity for people to rethink their mental models around a lot of other things that might be unrelated to, like, the fact that now it's normal for you to, like, log into Uber, for example, by putting in your phone number. They send you a text message and then you put in a code to, like, the Uber app. Like, the phone number literally is your, like, source of identity. Now that comes with a lot of issues. Like, carriers were not designed to be like, custodians of identity, right, as we often see in our space. But I think it is.
00:51:32.244 - 00:51:55.554, Speaker D: I do actually think that a new user experience paradigm would really be catalyzing for our community, even though it's not like the user experience paradigm is like, I am managing keys and sitting on keys, but if someone gets used to using a new thing with a different way of thinking about identity, I think that could be really interesting.
00:51:57.874 - 00:52:48.964, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, we've been like, if you think about like, the nature of identity, just generally, it's just like everything about identity in the world today is like, it's permission, but it's like, oh, I went to google.com or Yahoo or pick a website and like, they grant me some identity local to their system. And like, that was very convenient for like, managing a database or whatever back in the nineties when all this stuff started to take off. But, like, your identity is you. And so, like, you, I mean, you don't generate your own identity like, you get DNA from your parents, but, like, the next, like, closest digital representation of that would be like, I make up a cryptographic key and like, that's my identity. And so as I just think about, like, first order correctness of, like, how do you address the problem? Putting identity in the form of cryptography feels like, very profound.
00:52:52.324 - 00:53:51.268, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm a big fan of what twist is doing there. I think to kind of like, bridge that gap a little bit from a user experience perspective at least, because I think right now, like, I'm not. I think for like, you know, we see this a lot with our users of audius, for example. Like, people forget their passwords a lot and if they forgot their password and put in an incorrect email, because we do this flow where when you sign up for Audius, there's basically an email with a seed in a link that lets you recover your account, goes out to the user. If you had a bunk email and that email address that you put in so you don't get the recovery email and you forget your password. We are not capable of recovering a user's account. There's actually nothing our company can do to fix that because we don't custody these keys.
00:53:51.268 - 00:54:43.464, Speaker D: So users have a really hard time with that. This is such a common issue for us because people are used to password resets. We get emails, multiple emails a day, being like, hey, can you help me reset my password? Sorry. Fortunately, most of them have that recovery email and they can do okay. But if they also don't have the email, then people don't have the. I guess people haven't wrapped their head around the fact that we as companies building in this space, don't control the things we build once they're out in the world and in existing, the only way actually for modifications to happen at the level of we're going to repoint so and so's audience account to be controlled by a different wallet that would actually have to go through a community governance vote. Right.
00:54:43.464 - 00:55:07.204, Speaker D: It's not like something that is realistically like, you know, they could try to go make a case for it if they wanted to, but like, I think there's just so much kind of re education required and it's something we as a space need to like figure out how to do better with. I think solutions like Taurus are like a really great step in that, but it's still like really hard for a lot of people. I think.
00:55:09.324 - 00:55:32.396, Speaker B: I think it's really important. I agree with all that. And I think having built products that required KYC, it's always tough to do it. It fights against your crypto ethos, but it's such an important thing at the stage that we're at now. Just think about a few years and decades. You mentioned the metaverse. Imagine being in a virtual space.
00:55:32.396 - 00:56:02.664, Speaker B: How do you know that person that you're interacting with is who they say they are? You know, these person to person experiences are going to get deeper and deeper, right? So I think it's really important that we figure some of this stuff out now. I mean, just imagine when deepfake gets even better. The tech that powers these deepfake videos gets even better. It's going to be something that I think might actually be the catalyst for a lot of these experiences. Right. And there are some cool projects based building on that.
00:56:05.124 - 00:56:28.724, Speaker C: I mean, I think that the problems that we solve now will actually like prevent a lot of the bad effects from like, this. Like, you know, open easy to spoof web that we live in today. Like, because we have to. Right. Like there's, that's the only way this stuff will work. Right. So I'm, I guess, I guess our time is up, man.
00:56:28.724 - 00:56:46.930, Speaker C: These panels always want to run late because the conversation is so good. So like, thank you guys for, for joining. And like, I'm super excited to like be working in the space and building, like really cool shit. Like, I mean, that, that's always been like the most fun about it. Yeah.
00:56:46.962 - 00:57:18.334, Speaker A: Before we, before we close it out, we have a few, couple, couple questions from the audience. I'm just going to pull like the top three and throw them up here and I'll let a few folks take a stab at it. Before we, before we jump off, we have a couple of really good ones. This already got touched on a little bit, but let's dig into this a little bit more. The correlation between NFTs and physical collectibles and what the future looks like for that. I don't know if Jordan, reneal, either of you have opinion on that?
00:57:20.634 - 00:58:03.344, Speaker B: I think it's really cool. I think that's going to be coming sooner than we think. We're already experimenting with NFTs that we've already created representing access to certain physical goods. So if I own XYZ NFT, I can then purchase the shirt where anyone without the NFT wouldn't be able to purchase the t shirt. So obviously a ways to go before it like actually represents real world stuff. But with regards to real estate and things like that, it all just, we're kind of waiting for what happens on the other side. Like how do you actually, and it's all going to have to be off chain, at least at the start, where, how do we know, how does the bank know that this NFT represents ownership in that house? So there's a lot of things that have to happen, I think.
00:58:06.724 - 00:58:48.084, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that. I think it's been cool to see what Zora has done there with some of like RAC tape. I don't know if you all saw that, but it was like you were purchasing an NFT that you can exchange for a tape. I mean, actually, I guess Uniswap's socks were maybe the first version of this where there was this sort of tradable, right, to get socks in the future. But if you turn in the token to get the socks, the token goes away. So I think there have been interesting ways that this has gotten bridged, but it obviously requires some significant degree of centralization to make work.
00:58:54.524 - 00:58:54.876, Speaker B: Cool.
00:58:54.900 - 00:58:55.544, Speaker C: Cool.
00:58:57.004 - 00:59:01.424, Speaker A: I think this is another gun that we've seen pop up a few times.
00:59:01.924 - 00:59:11.824, Speaker C: Is there an item that you guys want to see an NFT of? What would blow your mind for me would be a black Lotus magic cards.
00:59:15.204 - 00:59:19.024, Speaker E: Can I get a season one, like a rookie card? A Michael Jordan rookie card?
00:59:23.174 - 00:59:42.486, Speaker B: Yeah. My Dodgers just won the World Series. And the meme is that it's just a hunk of metal. The trophy is just a hunk of medal, even though it takes 30 grand to make it or whatever. But it just kind of got me thinking. Like, it represents something, right? It represents all the hard work that goes into winning the World Series. It's just an item.
00:59:42.486 - 00:59:47.344, Speaker B: And that essentially could be referenced or put into an NFT.
00:59:53.524 - 01:00:11.184, Speaker A: We've seen this pop up a few times as well, simplifying what NFTs are for a more general audience. And I think this is an important question because as we want to expand this out to folks that are not specifically in the blockchain space, what's the simplest way that you use to explain nfts?
01:00:18.484 - 01:01:34.324, Speaker D: I mean, I'm happy to take that, I guess, like, we get a lot of questions from artists about it, like, especially after seeing what RAc did and what Blau has done as well. So, you know, I think there's a lot of excitement about, like, that means of kind of being able to monetize work. So the way we've tried to explain it to artists, at least, is it's kind of like a. You can think of it as like a commemoration of kind of, you know, like ownership in quotes of, like, the attached content, that ownership doesn't come with any extended rights or anything else, but it is almost meant to be almost like a memento or like a commemoration of one's kind of, you know, I guess artist endorsed ownership of the content. It's almost like if, you know, when signed, signed prints of art are more valuable than not signed prints of art, like, the fact that the artist has endorsed your ownership of it is what makes it valuable, not the digital file itself that backs the thing. It's almost like a transfer of, like, culture from one person to another.
01:01:40.344 - 01:01:41.684, Speaker C: That's pretty cool.
01:01:45.424 - 01:01:46.724, Speaker E: I like that statement.
01:01:47.104 - 01:01:54.084, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll tweet that afterwards. Yeah, a good sound bite.
01:01:55.624 - 01:02:07.674, Speaker A: That was a good one. Let's end it one more, I think. Jordan, this one's specifically for you. Raj wanted to hear more about the rug pool experiment with the defiant.
01:02:09.134 - 01:02:50.970, Speaker B: I honestly. What time is it? There's supposed to be an announcement today, I believe, with the defiant video. So I don't want to spoil everything but in the past week or ten days there's kind of been this underground community that have pieced together all these clues. So in the last defiant video there was a QR code that you scan and only several dozen people scanned this code and that led you to another kind of telegram group. So I don't want to spoil all the fun. There's a lot to be announced today, within the next couple of days at least. So I would check and see, check the Defiant, watch the last video, watch the next video.
01:02:50.970 - 01:03:00.550, Speaker B: And it's really exciting project between the Defiant and Robin and supermassive and the meme team. Cool.
01:03:00.622 - 01:03:15.834, Speaker A: And we'll drop the links for the videos in the chat channel in a moment. And I think that covered most of them. Nothing else here really, really stands out. So we're over time per usual.
01:03:16.534 - 01:03:17.382, Speaker D: Thank you, Jordan.
01:03:17.438 - 01:03:19.070, Speaker A: Thank you, Kyle. Thank you, reneal.
01:03:19.142 - 01:03:19.510, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:03:19.582 - 01:03:19.830, Speaker D: Thanks.
01:03:19.862 - 01:03:50.056, Speaker A: Totally. This was awesome. And for everyone who didn't get a chance to watch the entire video, everything gets recorded and gets uploaded to the Solana YouTube channel. So keep an eye out for that in the next 24 to 48 hours to get a recap of, of the entire panel. And we have two other chats. Today we have a fireside with Tarun, who is the founder and CEO of Gauntlet, in 2 hours. And then we have a panel about blockchain interoperability with Anatoly, Sam and James Preswitch at 03:00 p.m..
01:03:50.056 - 01:04:04.632, Speaker A: PT. So in 5 hours. So thank you. Thank you to everyone who attends these. I see a lot of familiar faces that continually show up and we appreciate it. And so thanks, everyone and thank you to the panelists. Have a great day, everyone.
01:04:04.688 - 01:04:05.376, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:04:05.520 - 01:04:05.904, Speaker E: Take care.
