00:00:07.560 - 00:00:39.362, Speaker A: My name is Brady Dale. I'm a reporter with the Defiant, a site you should definitely check out. We cover decentralized finance and everything going on on blockchains these days. We're here today to talk about gaming and crypto and how those two things interact, and they've been doing really well this year. I'm here today with Amy Wu of Lightspeed Ventures. He's made some relevant investments here, and he's interested in the topic. And then also Jeff Sterling, one of the co founders of Sky Mavis, the company that really is driving this conversation right now.
00:00:39.362 - 00:01:07.606, Speaker A: They made Axie Infinity. For those who don't know, Axie Infinity is a game that has some similarities to some historical games, but is just driving an insane amount of activity right now. And is as. As a product on Ethereum, is actually making more money than Ethereum itself, at least it was the last time I checked. Maybe that's not still true, but it's doing pretty okay. So we're here to talk about that and what's to come in gaming and why it is this is the moment that people are so excited. So.
00:01:07.606 - 00:01:09.474, Speaker A: Hello, Amy and Jeff.
00:01:09.814 - 00:01:12.354, Speaker B: Hey, Brady. Thanks for having us.
00:01:13.054 - 00:01:25.044, Speaker A: Yeah, glad to be here with you guys. I don't know why I can't see either of you yet. Okay, great. Hopefully the rest of the world can. So. All right, let's talk with. Let's start with a really.
00:01:25.044 - 00:02:04.274, Speaker A: I want to get specific into, like, axie and you guys particular interests in a second, but let's start with a really broad thing, which I've heard some, like, some of my fellow journalists have been sort of like, what's going on with this idea? You know, everyone talks about the metaverse these days, but the metaverse seems like it's becoming one of those terms that's becoming so broad, it's almost meaningless. It's like the metaverse is discord. The metaverse is Twitter. The metaverse is, you know, also the game environments. So what's you guys framing on that? And, like, how do you think about what the metaverse is? How do you. How do you define it? And why is it useful? I guess, most importantly, why is it useful to kind of expand the boundaries beyond games itself? Whoever wants to start.
00:02:04.934 - 00:02:06.182, Speaker B: Jeff, you want to start?
00:02:06.358 - 00:02:43.650, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So the way that I'm looking at it right now, at least this week, is I see it as a substrate where we're forming deep economic and social relationships with anyone anywhere in the world. And, yeah, we're doing it in new ways. So I guess it's sufficiently broad. Right. I mean, so the way that I'm seeing stuff unfold, right, is first we had defi these blockchains as well, right? Which is a lot, which allow for the transfer of financial value. And then now we're seeing the rise of nfts, right, which is kind of like the content layer.
00:02:43.650 - 00:03:26.644, Speaker C: We're seeing gaming and art explosives. So this is like, enough to capture consumer interests and adoption and allowing us to do something with the financial rails that's allowing us to kind of keep the attention of users and people, I guess. And then I guess the next aspect of it was, right. Kind of like the social coordination layer. Some people might think of that as daos and community tooling. So, yeah, I think the metaverse is the intersection of all these. So it's these large Internet communities having fun together, but also coordinating large amounts of social and financial capital.
00:03:26.644 - 00:03:29.244, Speaker C: So that's, I guess, the way that I'm looking at it.
00:03:30.024 - 00:03:59.584, Speaker B: That's great. Yeah. Digital economy meets sort of like IRL meets digital world as well. And I think a lot of people have talked about the format of it and sort of like, the different parts of that ecosystem. I always will it down to, if you're going to have a metaverse, people have to care about that. And the core layer of it starts with identity and reputation. And so that basically creates something meaningful for people to care about.
00:03:59.584 - 00:04:45.804, Speaker B: And so I actually do believe, like the first iteration, the first version of the metaverse, is the social networks. If you think about in Twitter, for example, whole communities in crypto have been built onto Twitter. Their online identity could be totally different from their offline one. Many people, I have no idea whether they're male, female, personality, age, et cetera. And it doesn't really matter. And that is, in my perspective, metaverse discord as well. And so with that identity and people caring about the reputation, they build on top of that, then you start building the other things that Jeff mentioned, like the economies of it, the what you do in that metaverse, et cetera.
00:04:45.804 - 00:04:47.804, Speaker B: But I think it does start there.
00:04:49.584 - 00:05:16.344, Speaker A: Folks have a hard time with is, you know, if you know, like about Neal Stephenson's snow crash, for example, like, the metaverse was this idea that there would be this cyberspace that felt a lot like the real world that you would go into. And like, that was the metaverse, this, like, this kind of giant game environment. And so I think folks find it confusing to, like, expand it out to, like, you know, places where players talk. So, you know, why is it useful to expand it out in that way.
00:05:17.924 - 00:06:18.042, Speaker C: So I don't know. I try and look at it as through a product lens, right? It's like, so what are the benefits of the real world? And then, like, okay, are those benefits? Right? So it's like, okay, can those benefits be simulated in a virtual environment without a 3d immersive environment? That makes sense. So I think they can. So I think, I don't know, maybe Hollywood and books have, I think, narrowed people's definition, or they think that there must be this immersive environment aspect to it, which I don't think is necessarily a prerequisite. I think it's something that we, you know, it's maybe a wishful thing, but I don't know. I also think that the future rarely unfolds exactly how we think it's going to. So, I mean, we already are seeing, you know, we're seeing these metaverse filipino workers who are playing axie infinity, you know, putting food on the table.
00:06:18.042 - 00:06:45.904, Speaker C: That's real, right? Like, does it. The data, it doesn't require them to put on some kind of space suit and glasses. Right? In fact, the people who need this the most, they're not going to be able to afford stuff like that for decades. So I think relying on something like that is maybe a little bit too strict and maybe not, I hate to say this, but maybe not inclusive to the people who might need this the most.
00:06:47.604 - 00:06:47.964, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:48.004 - 00:06:50.444, Speaker A: So that helps. Oh, sorry, go ahead.
00:06:51.264 - 00:07:22.418, Speaker B: Oh, I was just going to add. Yeah, the communications layer is important because, again, like, that actually creates social fabric of what is, like, you know, a digital world. Right? And so I think about it as, like, you know, massive hierarchy of needs. Like, people have deep social needs of, like, you know, love. Love and beyond belonging, self esteem, et cetera, that they form in these groups to promote their identity and reputation. And then I think the beauty of, like, for example, axie infinity is that people can earn money. That is absolutely a core need.
00:07:22.418 - 00:07:34.094, Speaker B: And so you combine all of that together, and people start spending large amounts of time, resources into whatever it is that world that's been created. And those are the building blocks of a metaverse.
00:07:35.914 - 00:07:57.552, Speaker A: You know, just randomly, it just happens to be, there's a, there's a guy on Twitter that I've been talking to forever. We just sort of have common interests. And I guess I've moved to his neighborhood. So we're getting together tonight for drinks, finally. So I guess I'm having one of those metaverse, Twitter's really real metaverse I've ever been a part of, I guess. But I guess I'm having a metaverse moment this evening, so hopefully that'll be cool. Yeah, so I want to.
00:07:57.552 - 00:08:20.976, Speaker A: So that the thing about folks making money on axie comes to kind of my next thing I wanted to talk to you guys about is so blockchain games, are people excited about them right now because they're fun or because they can make money on them? And, you know, does the distinction matter? I'm sorry to you, Amy. You ended the last one. Start with you.
00:08:21.160 - 00:09:01.408, Speaker B: Sure. The distinction, I would say, like, they're two different things. Right? Like, I think, you know, the Axie game is fun for a lot of people, but people also make money ultimately, if you look at the gaming industry or entertainment, like, people stick around, like, in the longer term because they are getting value from that, right. Whether it is earning money or because they're having fun. And so I think you're getting like two different types of players. Like a player and player is on the platform, and probably a bunch of them are actually having fun, but a lot of them are also serving a basic need of minimum wage. Right.
00:09:01.408 - 00:09:19.604, Speaker B: And so they're expecting to earn money off of this game. And then you have a bunch of other people that are playing for the PvP mode and looking forward to the kind of like the land games because that's like fun. They get to play with other players. And you really do need both in the long run to balance out a game ecosystem.
00:09:21.424 - 00:09:51.284, Speaker C: Yeah. So I've done some surveying, right? And around 45% of our users say that the economy, the in game economy is the most important thing. But the other 55% are saying that the community or the gameplay are the most important thing. And I think it is really the. It's a combination. Right. This is the first time that you can kind of transparently play a game and actually retain some of the value.
00:09:51.284 - 00:10:07.000, Speaker C: So growing up, that was always a dream of mine. And I was always trying to do that and running into huge issues. And, yeah, I was having a lot of fun playing World of Warcraft, playing Diablo. Right. Grind. I guess grinding is actually not really that fun in those systems. Right.
00:10:07.000 - 00:10:15.632, Speaker C: So it's like, that's like a little bit longer. It's a little bit of a tangent, but yeah, I think it is when.
00:10:15.648 - 00:10:24.752, Speaker A: You'Re grinding just to find other people in case they don't know. Cause I'm not like a super gamer. Grinding is when you're just like doing the grunt work to get resources. Right?
00:10:24.848 - 00:10:48.324, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically, games have always used these incentive mechanisms right. So some people, they play, right just to get like cool. And that's the thing that lights up their dopamine receptors. Others are trying to make friends in these universes. So I think play to earn is just one additional, I think, very powerful incentive mechanism that game designers will now have at their disposal. It's just another incentive loop.
00:10:48.324 - 00:10:54.684, Speaker C: We've always used incentive loops to control, I guess, and encourage gamers to interact.
00:10:54.724 - 00:11:47.838, Speaker B: With the content that, yeah, that's a good point. So maybe someone on one, like how do game designers think about building a game? Right at the core of it is everybody is playing for some sort of like progression towards a payout that is like deep in the psychology of like why somebody would spend the time to play a game. They start a new game, they spend the first, I don't know, like an hour or so, like learning the game. And then in the mid game is where they're grinding. They're essentially like progressing themselves towards mastery of the game, whether that is like leveling up their characters, collecting items, you know, beating a bunch of other players to level up their, their character, earning money, you know, sort of leveling up their axie, like, et cetera. And that is like core game loops that game economists and designers basically build into the game. And then at some point they're like, okay, I feel like I've like mastered this game.
00:11:47.838 - 00:12:26.374, Speaker B: I've gotten to a great level. I'm an advanced player. And at that point the game designer is like, how do I surprise, delight this player and continue to have them wanting more content from me to keep them spending money with me and spending time with me and sort of, and that's the elder game. Like this. Managing this whole player progression is a core for any game designer. And so like, to Jeff's point, you know, the play to earn loop is like one of them. And also, you know, managing people playing like Pve mode or PvP mode, those are all sort of different player journeys that, you know, people go through in the game.
00:12:28.354 - 00:12:56.894, Speaker A: When I run these things, I always like to just jump right in at first and then come back to really who we're talking to. So I think this is a good time to do that. You both kind of showed a little bit about yourselves and those last answers. But maybe you could both introduce your, I mean, not your whole background, but like your relationship to games and why this is a, a priority for each of you really quickly. And then, and then I want to come back to some stuff about Axie, but first, like, yeah, why don't you both just sort of say who you are and why you care about games.
00:12:58.954 - 00:13:34.902, Speaker C: Sure, I guess I'll go first. I'm Jeff, I'm a co founder of Sky Mavis. We're the inventors, creators of Axie. Yeah, I've always been a gamer, so growing up, I was an only child, so I, yeah, I, I played games most of my free time and the first thing that I ever did on the Internet was play Starcraft. So I think early on our generation, we kind of understood that games could be these portals to new emerging technologies. Now, I was always the kid who, if I played a game, my entire school would play that game. So people.
00:13:34.902 - 00:14:14.112, Speaker C: Yeah, what else? Yeah, I'm also a collector, a lifelong collector. I grew up collecting insects and fossils. So I think that overlap of collecting and gaming is kind of what brought me and made it so that NFTs kind of just immediately made sense to me. Yeah, I was always trying to monetize my time in game. Neopets, Diablo, World of Warcraft, always running up into friction and tos violations and felt like these systems were trying, kind of working against me. Yeah. So, yeah, I always think of myself as a kid, right? Like, I'm a gamer who wants to spend time in game, but like the people around him don't want him to play.
00:14:14.112 - 00:14:38.724, Speaker C: Like my mom really didn't want me to play because people, there's a stigma that gaming is this huge waste of time. But if we can create games that have real world benefits, social and economic benefits, then maybe this can change. I think it's important because we're seeing, for example, the communist party now cracking down on children's right to play games. I guess.
00:14:40.804 - 00:14:50.584, Speaker A: Axie, your first, like, you know, blonde professional game you've been a part of, or are you a veteran of some other game efforts?
00:14:51.244 - 00:15:15.314, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. You know, I like to, I like to think that I played kind of semi professional. I played World of Warcraft semi professionally as a kid. Back then it was very difficult to monetize. But yeah, I was never, I was never a game developer. Right. I think the current, you know, the traditional gaming ecosystem, it's like you need a publisher, you need, you know, you need to raise huge money for marketing costs.
00:15:15.314 - 00:16:00.644, Speaker C: Right? So I think like a lot of it, right. It's just the, the barriers to entry because of all the middlemen involved is just impossible. So even if you've wanted to build a game all your life, it's, it's really, really difficult. As a struggling indie dev that's never had a hit game before. So I think that's also one of the things that NFTs can help equalize or kind of level this playing field of barrier to entry where if you are a good, if you have a good idea for a game and you have good art and you have good community building skills on your team, then you can basically go out there, even get funded by the community at first to get some initial traction, to get this initial community before you have to like, I don't know, play the more buttoned up game, if that makes sense.
00:16:02.144 - 00:16:06.924, Speaker A: It's going okay. So congratulations, Amy, what about you? What's your connection to.
00:16:08.224 - 00:17:07.682, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been a lifelong gamer. I mean, I probably spend like more time playing games than anything else I did growing up. A big first person shooter player, like on CS Go. And then, you know, it was like left four dead, one and two, play all the residential Resident evil games, huge like horse survival shooter fan, all of the Blizzard games as well, like Diablo and unotherwise. So I first started working in it professionally when I was at insight and we had taken private Jagex Runescape and learned a lot of lessons there, including how angry players can get if you mess with their, you know, gameplay monetization. And then at Lightspeed, you know, I lead a lot of our game investments and so we have a few theses. You know, we just think that gaming is already the biggest entertainment category in the world and it's only growing from here.
00:17:07.682 - 00:18:01.414, Speaker B: So last year, I think $175 billion of in game spend alone, not even including hardware, sort of PlayStation boxes and otherwise, and also things like Twitch and the rest of the ecosystem and 2 billion gamers today. Also the gaming and social worlds are colliding. They're becoming one in the same. I think the next big social networks may well find themselves in games first. And also you see this gamification of consumer apps across every single category, fintech, et cetera. So it's just a massive category that we are both like, I'm both personally passionate about and also think it's just massive and growing. And then also being a crypto investor, it's been amazing seeing the intersection of gaming and blockchain tech.
00:18:01.414 - 00:18:30.624, Speaker B: So both, I've been spending a lot of time with the publishers and talking with them through their strategy, but then also meeting with dozens of blockchain gaming teams as they're building kind of natively these games. And so super excited to invest in the category. And I think we're actually closing our 1st, 1st investment right now that we're working on with Solana. Very excited. And so, yeah, really, really pumped in the space.
00:18:33.404 - 00:18:54.084, Speaker A: You know, I guess I was born like, a little too early. I kind of quit gaming around the time the NES came out, but I played that a lot. And I happen to remember this one thing. If you guys remember the original mega man game, part of that game is you defeat characters and you get their abilities. Right. And I got really excited when I learned that, like, the muscle man character could, like, move things around.
00:18:58.624 - 00:19:23.804, Speaker B: Oops. Just lost. Just lost, Brady. But anyway, for people who don't know, I mean, at Lisp, we have about a dozen companies in our gaming portfolio. Big investors in Epic Games just announced our investment in Splitgate, and then we have about, you know, half dozen or so pre launch AAA studios and counting. Brady, we lost your last question.
00:19:25.264 - 00:19:25.960, Speaker C: Welcome back.
00:19:26.032 - 00:19:27.728, Speaker A: I was just kind of. Can you hear me now?
00:19:27.856 - 00:19:28.804, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:19:31.144 - 00:20:11.306, Speaker A: Same experience, but it's cool. So let's go back to Axie. So, you know, I think folks who maybe are casually aware of Axie, maybe read a couple of stories about its recent success, sort of know that there's this battle element and there's this kind of, I don't know, wander very traditional gaming formats that people are used to. Let's forget about all that. That's the stuff people know. I know there's also, like a more traditionally, what we think of as metaverse element. There's like a land element, a sort of an invitation to developers to build their own things in there kind of, kind of side.
00:20:11.306 - 00:20:22.214, Speaker A: What can you tell us about that at this point, Jeff? And, like, what can we look forward to about the axie real estate? Axie land, you know, the open world of Axie.
00:20:23.594 - 00:20:39.964, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think land is one of the things that our community is most excited about. Definitely. It started out initially as terrariums. So we were like, okay, all pets. Axies are pets. All pets need a home.
00:20:39.964 - 00:21:16.052, Speaker C: And then I think we realized that this vision could be much larger and that kind of gradually morphed into a land system. So there are kind of three threads that we think through when we're looking at land. So there's this one, this element of collecting resources. Some of those resources might be real tokens, know, building a town, a village, a city. So kind of crafting and building. Right. Then there's this idea of kind of a persistent world that is constantly.
00:21:16.052 - 00:22:23.848, Speaker C: Right with some areas that are constantly up for grab some territory that might be yielding resources, and for there to be this constant. Right, like struggle and battle for resources between kind of warring kingdoms or factions or tribes within this universe. So those are like two elements. And then there's the third element, which is, okay, maybe you bring in this idea of kind of like a roblox like game creation platform where you can have third party developers, community developers, hobbyists, maybe in some cases large game studios building experiences on top of the land. So I think the art is to write, like, how do we prioritize development on each one of these threads? But yeah, and then also, so I think, like one of it, one of the things, right, is like just talking to the community. It seems like right in the short term, the MVP could definitely be more focused on harvesting resources and maybe building up. So basically letting the art and the in game economy come to carry, carry things.
00:22:23.848 - 00:22:42.404, Speaker C: But I think long term, right, like more complex battles for territory as well as this ability to build on top, I think that's going to be really, really important and basically allowing for something that could last for 50 years, for example. So, yeah, that's at least, I don't know, a window into how I'm thinking about it.
00:22:43.904 - 00:22:52.258, Speaker A: Some of that starts to realize, I mean, land is available to buy right now, right? But you can't really do anything with it. Am I correct about that?
00:22:52.386 - 00:23:26.638, Speaker C: So we did it. We had an internal alpha, so we had an open alpha for all landholders to check out what we had finished about nine months ago. So people have used their land in the past. Yeah. It's something that takes a lot of care and effort. So we hope to have something playable out, something fun for people to get their hands dirty with. Maybe next year, first half.
00:23:26.638 - 00:23:34.966, Speaker C: It's quite difficult to give predictions around these types of things. We tend to think in terms of pipeline these days.
00:23:35.110 - 00:23:54.234, Speaker A: Idea. No, I get it. And folks should take that to heart as these things are really tricky. And Amy, as an investor, what's Lightspeed's take on land in these games? I know I used to work for DCG kind of indirectly through coindesk, and I know they were very excited about decentraland. What do you guys take?
00:23:55.014 - 00:24:28.964, Speaker B: It's definitely right now, I mean, it's interesting as like a asset for speculation. I would say, like, land has become really valuable very quickly, even before I even have any idea, like, how to play, like, what is actually built on it. And the game around the land is ultimately going to be really important. And so, um, yes, I'm pretty excited, Jeff, to see like, what you guys have up your sleeves there. Um, I think for, for developers that are game developers that are thinking about incorporating Lan into their blockchain game. Um, there's probably two genres of games. I would encourage them to take a look at.
00:24:28.964 - 00:25:28.594, Speaker B: Like one or one is like forex games and the other is just open world. And so on the forex side, um, if you look at sort of Game of Thrones or um, you know, Star wars, galaxy heroes, um, to an extent, and some others, and certainly like the mmos, like Eve and others that have some aspect of like, land property elements to it, there's, I think it's important to create like, game loops and gameplay that really drives players sort of like skill, coordination, strategy. Right. That's like the core of like the forex game. You know, how do you control your land? How might you use it? Maybe like, conquer somebody else's land? I think those, like, really encourage deep interactions between players, engagement, and we'll be able to create whole, like, you know, amounts of like, they will allow, like, players to really have a lot of fun with the land concept. And the other one is more of like the Animal crossing style gameplay right. Around land, it's like you own your property, you build things.
00:25:28.594 - 00:25:53.634, Speaker B: It's a lot more of a casual type of game mode where you can buy furniture for your house and plant gardens and things like that. And it's more around nurturing and building rather than like competition and strategy. And so depending on like, what kind of a genre you're building, you can utilize land in different ways. But that's the kind of thing that I really like to hear from game, game makers around what they're thinking.
00:25:54.174 - 00:26:07.194, Speaker A: We're talking to crypto folks here. We need some alpha for folks like, what is, what is the smart place to put your resources? Is it, should they be looking for the tokens of good games or should they try to get it, get ahead of this whole land thing? What's the move?
00:26:08.234 - 00:26:54.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you can try to get in as early as possible on, on the token side or, you know, on their, on these early sales on the, on the, on the land side. I think the way that, for example, Amber Sword had done it was that they kind of, they had so much that over subscription of people trying to buy land. And then I think, Jeff, you guys did too. And so there was sort of like a, well, we're going to decide Ember Sword and they, they needed to, and then they decided sort of who got what plots of land. And I imagine that probably has something to do with like, the degree somebody was involved in the community. And so I think that's going to be. That's really key, you know, like there's more, there's more dollars trying to find their way to like buying early, early game token and land and so make like, make people show you that you're, you're engaged member of the community on discord and otherwise.
00:26:54.954 - 00:26:57.234, Speaker B: In order to participate in that.
00:27:00.994 - 00:27:49.314, Speaker A: I wanted to ask both of you about Jeff, not that I want you to talk about competitors, but I feel like you guys have got the pole position in this space right now. It doesn't matter too much. I could be wrong, but it seems like games are a hot thing right now. They're maybe the next thing actual games, the next thing following pure collectible nfts. Maybe so. I know there's some kind of cool blockchain related games out there that aren't quite as widely known as Axie right now. Can we get some suggestions for folks of things they might want to just go poke around, not saying that they're guaranteed going to make a lot of money off of messing with them, but just what are good blockchain games that seem like they have potential that you both have seen?
00:27:52.354 - 00:27:54.014, Speaker B: Jeff, you want me to go first?
00:27:54.794 - 00:27:55.986, Speaker A: Do Amy first?
00:27:56.170 - 00:28:27.726, Speaker B: Ok. Me first. The interesting thing is that there's not a lot of games that are live, right. Because it does take years to build a great game. And so in the dozens and dozens of teams I've talked to, people are building right now and their games are going live on a timeframe of maybe in six months time to a few years out. And so like, honestly, I think that in terms of what's live, Axie Infinity is the most fun like, game to be playing right now. And that's why you guys are so dominant.
00:28:27.726 - 00:28:51.696, Speaker B: You know, you were, you were there kind of earlier than, than almost everybody else. And, and so I encourage people to follow this space. I mean, in terms of projects that have a lot of like, you know, I think I'm super interested in play testing things like Dark Forest or ember sword, parallel life's game or the blockchain game. Yeah, these are all.
00:28:51.720 - 00:28:52.640, Speaker A: Ember sword is a question.
00:28:52.752 - 00:28:53.040, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:53.072 - 00:28:53.832, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:28:53.968 - 00:29:17.174, Speaker B: Alluvium, star atlas. There's like, there's so many genopets. Like, there's, there's like a lot that are coming out and I think in a couple of years time we're gonna have this like renaissance of like blockchain games for gamers. But in the meantime, you know, I think, jeff, you guys don't have a ton of competition in this space live.
00:29:19.274 - 00:29:25.814, Speaker A: You can get involved a little bit now. It's like, yeah, Jeff, what's your take? What looks promising to you?
00:29:26.434 - 00:30:17.222, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, so I would, first of all, just on the competition aspect, I would love for there to be many more blockchain games that are live. I think Axie, I think what we need is we do need other projects that are bringing in more players, more content creators. This ecosystem, people can only play Axie for around 5 hours a day. So I'd love for them to be able to play other games in those other slots. It also is important for the dominant, it's also important for the dominant product in a market to have smaller products to look at so that we can, they can ab test features for us. So we feel like, okay, this loop is working really well in that game. Like, we need to also have that.
00:30:17.222 - 00:30:34.048, Speaker C: That's also right. In the spirit of open source and blockchain and blockchain development. It's just like forking code over and ideas. Yeah. So that's it. I mean, I invested in a game called Nine Chronicles and I've invested in Aurora. Nine Chronicles is live.
00:30:34.048 - 00:31:02.528, Speaker C: That it is a korean team that's been grinding for a long time. So, yeah, I would take a look at that. I like that they, it seems like they have a fun game, but more importantly, they were building for a long time when nobody was looking at the space. So I think that they're going to. They're onto something. So. Yeah, but I would say one thing that I will say is I'm a little bit unsure.
00:31:02.528 - 00:31:43.698, Speaker C: A lot of people, they're obsessed with this idea of making like a aaa, like Super, I don't know, like really intense, graphically intense game. So then it's like, okay, maybe you're limited to desktop users, right. Which is actually like a kind of a shrinking market where, you know, if you want to go, if you want your total addressable market to be 4 billion people, which is what axie is aiming for, it should be mobile, it should be like Android friendly, if that makes sense. Right. So I would just caution that, like, if you're going for like a desktop super high performance game, you're going to be competing. You're basically right. This is going to be kind of like for western or east asian players.
00:31:43.698 - 00:32:28.200, Speaker C: And then it's like if you add the play to earn loop, it's like, what is the daily wage that these people with very high, powerful, high, very powerful computers, what is the wage? You know, what is, what is the play to earn mechanism? How high does that need to be in order to make it worth your time. Otherwise, okay. Like, yeah, you can make a really amazing, fun game and then, but then you're kind of like you're competing against the rest of the games out there. You're not necessarily like, I think if you've read like, I don't know, David and Goliath. Right. It's like, what is the unique thing that we can use to slay the incumbents? It's this, it's this idea, I think, of play to earn. Right? That's, that's why we, no game, no NFT project was able to experience exponential growth until the discovery, the invention of play to earn.
00:32:28.200 - 00:32:46.004, Speaker C: Right. Why? Because this is a novel thing. It is sometimes annoying that people focus only on that because then this, you know, the fact that axie is a fun and a very fun game kind of gets lost in the discussion. So some people don't, some people think that the only reason that people play Axie is because of play to earn anyways.
00:32:46.624 - 00:33:32.762, Speaker A: But yeah, you guys have done well. Can you hear, can you hear me? It's interesting. You guys have done well with play to earn because, you know, I've been a real critic of the token. I have. I got a call there, then just screwed things up. I've been real critic of the token powered social networks because having watched a few social networks, even ones that were before tokens that we're trying to like, reward people monetarily for participating, they just became really irritating to be a part of, you know, because like all anyone talked about was making money on them. And I guess I would have at the outset worried the same thing would happen with games, but it doesn't seem like it's, it's quite happened.
00:33:32.762 - 00:33:53.134, Speaker A: I want to do a quick random aside just to Jeff. You said you played StarCraft or whichever one of the, that's the same guy as, who was working he to make like Star Citizen or whatever that is. That, is that the same, is that connection there? You know what I'm talking about?
00:33:58.154 - 00:34:03.734, Speaker C: So Starcraft is like the Blizzard game. It's like the national sport of Korea. When I was growing up.
00:34:06.354 - 00:34:30.064, Speaker A: There was a, well, so there was, I don't know if you know, I was just curious if this story gave you pause. There was a big game developer from like the nineties who made a big game that was Star or something. And then in the mid, in the, around 2014, he had the biggest crowd sale of all time at that time to create a new open world universe. And it's kind of been a disaster.
00:34:30.144 - 00:34:32.120, Speaker B: I mean, is it ever going to last? Like never?
00:34:32.192 - 00:34:40.802, Speaker A: Yeah. Star Citizen. Yeah. Yeah, I just, I wondered if, like going into like, if you knew that story, if that gave you pause, sort of trying to create a universe somewhat like that, even though a little more chill.
00:34:40.858 - 00:35:16.516, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's like a certainly concern of mine. I mean, I think right now we're at this point where, you know, NFT drops do not make like a game. I think. I think teams can raise like ten, 5100 million dollars right now if you just say that you're making a blockchain game. But I mean, what, like, I really am listening for, like, what are they actually building? Are they serious about game design? Do they want to make a fun game? Do they even understand, like, what, what, you know, that entails? And to Jeff's point, it doesn't need to be Triple A. It can be something a lot more casual. Right.
00:35:16.516 - 00:36:01.684, Speaker B: Like for example, the, the, um, the team that both Jeff and salon team and I are really excited about, we're going to talk announce soon, is a browser gaming company that decided that, you know, it was like really conducive to actually to blockchain because of Metamask, Phantom Wallet and other wallet integrations. That's not AAAA game. But, you know, like, certainly there's a lot of like, game design know how that team has. Right. And so, like, when I see, like, so I think right now we're in this moment of time where there's so much money going to blockchain gaming, driving up round sizes and valuations. Sometimes when I talk to teams, I feel like I get weird looks just by asking. Okay, so, like, tell me more about the actual game that you're making.
00:36:01.684 - 00:36:19.824, Speaker B: And ultimately that's what's going to matter. And the NFT drops are an amazing signal for whether the team knows how to engage community and also make great arts. But ultimately people are going to stick around if they have something fun to play.
00:36:21.164 - 00:36:32.164, Speaker A: So NFT drops. I wanted to ask you guys about this. Are you all loot believers or loot skills skeptics? Like, what is, is a list of items going to become a game.
00:36:34.504 - 00:37:00.994, Speaker B: I can start? I think it's like an absolute phenomenon. So I don't even know people, like, hating on it. Like, the fact is that it captured so many people's imaginations and also fomo, because so few people actually got loot, at least primary drop. And then in terms of how I see that community developing, it reminds me of modding. Right. It truly is like, you're asking the community to build the game for you. And.
00:37:00.994 - 00:37:31.964, Speaker B: And so I'm like, you know, I like a couple of really amazing game devs could probably build something amazing if they so are. If they're incentivized and they want to put the time energy into it. So, you know, I'm not gonna bet against that. Like, but I think that's kind of what it would entail. Like, I think it's certainly difficult to not have, like, a centralized team to actually drive some of that, organize, you know, and build, like, a first party game. Like, mods are usually built around, like, a core game, but, I mean, this is, like, a new paradigm that is being explored.
00:37:34.224 - 00:37:36.280, Speaker A: Jeff, do you buy it? Are you a skeptic?
00:37:36.352 - 00:37:56.072, Speaker C: I mean, I own some loot. I will say that I bought it one ETH, and it's done really well for me, I guess. You know, I mean, I'm a moderate when it comes to, like, things like this, in terms of. I believe in, you know, I do believe in. I believe in bottom up contribution. I think that's super important. I also think that, you know, it's.
00:37:56.072 - 00:38:21.954, Speaker C: You need. You also need a team or large, a group of, you know, many large teams driving forward the development of a project. So, yeah, that's one thing that I would look towards. I would say that I was really excited about loot, but then I was also, like. I was a little bit, like, turned off that some people were trying to, like, co op the narrative. The narrative. Because, you know, when I discovered axie, it was also six words.
00:38:21.954 - 00:38:33.514, Speaker C: Each axe was just. Or, sorry, eight. Each axe was. Yeah, just six traits. And I felt like that wasn't necessarily something that we could even brag about at the time. It was a bear market. Like, people would.
00:38:33.514 - 00:38:47.650, Speaker C: So people would have just not. Were not interested in it. Like, so until people could see. Actually see their axes, maybe because, like, the original team was, like, vietnamese or something. There's something, like, there. Like, people just were like, okay, is this actually. Is this actually a scam or what? Right.
00:38:47.650 - 00:39:20.270, Speaker C: But I think this idea of a, like, basically a user owned and governed and built game universe, I think it's incredibly important, and I think we want to, like, incorporate the strongest elements of that into axie. Right. We have, you know, long term, we do see, we do believe that axie, that Sky Mavis would be just one of many teams building on top of Axie, the Axie universe. Right now, my team is only three people or four people. So it's, like, the majority of them. And we've never spent any money on marketing. Right.
00:39:20.270 - 00:39:56.934, Speaker C: So it's like we're in a large and some other game company of this scale, right. Producing this, driving this amount of revenue. I don't know, you probably need like 100 people or something, like doing marketing and stuff like that, and publishing. So the community right now is actually doing a majority of the work related to content creation, education, onboarding. It's just so I think, like, that is also an important thing to look at. We're already seeing this. I do think that, yeah, people are excited, and rightfully so, about the idea of, like, right, like, modding culture making its way into web3 as well.
00:39:59.754 - 00:40:11.850, Speaker A: Sorry, Jeff, you said something there that I didn't, not sure understood or maybe people don't know. Did Axie not quite start with you? Like, you said something about when you discovered Axie. Like, what's the, what's the backstory there?
00:40:11.922 - 00:40:43.144, Speaker C: Community member. So when I, when I discovered Axie, it was just, you know, ten people, like ten to 20 people on a discord, and they had just revealed, I think, like, I found out about it when, yeah, like, I just started out as a community member. I bought some axies and then I bought three axies. I couldn't see them yet. And then it was a whole event where, okay, like, this is, you know, you can finally look at your axies. And then, because I own some, I was like, okay, like, what do we do now? Like, we have to, we have to make sure that this project does well. So I started helping manage the community.
00:40:43.144 - 00:41:01.584, Speaker C: You know, just started increasing my involvement over time. And then eventually it was like, okay, let's start a company to build on, you know, to kind of make sure that this vision is completed and that's, you know, how Sky Mabus started. Right? Sky Mabus was not even a thing when it went axies started.
00:41:01.924 - 00:41:10.784, Speaker A: No, I knew that. I just didn't realize. Yeah, it's kind of, that's sort of like how maker Dow started, too. That was just kind of a gang in some forums with some ideas.
00:41:11.364 - 00:41:18.584, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there's definitely something to like, right. Like this grassroots team formation that's, that's really powerful.
00:41:19.804 - 00:41:47.414, Speaker A: So for the, for the skeptics out there who were like, I mean, they understand that gaming's big and gaming's valuable, but I think it is a little hard sometimes for folks to picture, like, why is this, why are these things that people gather up in these games? Like, why do they have real world value and kind of, like, a lot of real world value. You know, how do you help people picture that and understand it? And Jeff, let's start with you. But Amy, I'm sure you have thoughts on this as well.
00:41:48.394 - 00:42:42.274, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, so one way to look at it is we're living in an increasingly digital world, right? For the last two years, we could barely go outside. So our digital possessions, our digital identity is starting to become increasingly more important, right? Nobody cares what watch you have, what car you have, things like this. So in a pseudo anonymous digital environment, what are the ways that you can kind of show off, just kind of identify yourselves and show that you're, I don't know, a connoisseur or you're an important person, you're someone worth talking to? I get thousands of messages each day. How do I prioritize who I even respond to? There have been people who, because they have the right axie as their picture when they message me. Because of that, it's led to more conversations. It's led to substantial relationships.
00:42:42.274 - 00:43:13.264, Speaker C: If we believe that the cloud is becoming a great place to make very deep economic and social relationships, then the way that we curate for the people that we interact with in these environments is becoming important. And if we can use our digital items or in our nfts, basically as ways to curate who we speak to, who we become friends with, then, right. There's real value generated through that process. Therefore, there is real value assigned to these items.
00:43:15.724 - 00:43:18.264, Speaker A: What about you, Amy? What's your take there?
00:43:18.844 - 00:43:29.500, Speaker B: And the core question is, I guess, what to make of, like, the NFT craze right now? Something like. Or how to think about the value assigned.
00:43:29.692 - 00:43:40.060, Speaker A: I think more specifically, like, why are in game items? Like, sort of why, how can they, how do they have real value in the real world? I think that. I think that's just confusing for, like, the man on the street, you know?
00:43:40.212 - 00:43:40.692, Speaker B: Okay.
00:43:40.748 - 00:43:49.432, Speaker A: I see especially, like, a lot of value. You know, like, axies are really expensive. You know, like, to get a few axies to play. You know, it's a, it's a good chunk of cash.
00:43:49.568 - 00:44:32.090, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, a digital good. Or like a piece of art or anything as valuable as what the owner and others believe it to be. Right? And then the more that item has value beyond just how much can I sell this for? Which, by the way, is the primary use case for buying nfts. Still speculation, definitely collectors and then some of the artists is beautiful also, or the axis are very cute. Like, people want to collect those. I mean, as an investor, I'm always thinking and also as a gamer, the more you can imbue value into this item, the more valuable it becomes.
00:44:32.090 - 00:45:15.442, Speaker B: And we've long believed that gaming was the best case for nfts. And so if you're able to play with that asset, whether it's an axie or it's an in game sword or something, or like a skin, use it, maybe. Maybe you can use it with another game. But maybe it's just like within the closed game ecosystem that essentially kind of imparts value to the owner. Right? And you're starting to see you start being able to or wanting to spend more money to acquire that item or more time in order to acquire that item, because you're getting a lot of, like, roi from it. You use it or you like looking at it. So that's why in terms of how valuable is this in the outside world? I mean, probably it's not valuable at all.
00:45:15.442 - 00:45:43.754, Speaker B: But do I think an item that I've been basically grinding to get in, I don't know, my MMO game or whatever, is valuable to me in the digital world? Absolutely. And I'm willing to spend money on that. But it has value in the context of the metaverse kind of digital worlds. Or maybe the value outside of that is more like bragging rights. Like, oh, I have this item. Like, I paid x amount of money for this, and now everyone knows that I can afford that. But really the value is in game.
00:45:45.894 - 00:46:33.524, Speaker A: And, you know that you brought up something there that, you know, I wrote about. I was writing about NFTs, you know, long before they were really popping off, and I actually sort of got a little bored about writing them. At a certain point, I kind of was starting to doubt that they were going to, and they just, and then they did. And I was wrong about that. But one of the things that folks talked about a lot back in those finger crossed days, kind of 2018 and 2019, was this notion that people would start composing with other people's items. We'd start seeing cryptokitties and axie or whatever, and that just really hasn't happened. Do you guys think it will, or is that sort of a misunderstanding of how people are going to really think about this stuff?
00:46:34.224 - 00:47:21.210, Speaker C: I think for me, I'm on the growth side of things. So when I look at a mechanism, I try and obviously, I don't know, related to what I do within the network. So for me, horizontal interoperability, basically using game assets from one ecosystem in another, I've always seen that as an attack vector or marketing strategy for me. Okay, why would I give use for some other NFT? If they had a really large community that I wanted to introduce to my game, I would do that. But the problem is there are no super large NFT communities yet, if that makes sense. I think that's going to become a thing. I think it's going to be less like friendly.
00:47:21.210 - 00:47:27.334, Speaker C: Maybe I'm just not a friendly person, but I see it as less of a friendly thing.
00:47:29.714 - 00:47:37.114, Speaker A: Will it be kind of like sushi swap and uniswap? Like you'll say like if you bring your in game items over our game, we'll blow it up.
00:47:37.194 - 00:47:59.034, Speaker C: It could be a potential sapphire attack, right? It's like destroy all your. So in the beginning, like, we were thinking like, oh, like, well, let's let people pay with gen zero kitties for origin axies or, or axie land, right? And then we basically finish up, finish sucking up the rest of the cryptokitty community that we hadn't, like, absorbed in the beginning.
00:48:01.614 - 00:48:59.654, Speaker B: I'm so like, I think idealists talk about interoperability of these NFT items a lot. And yeah, I think in a, there is like a format in which in the future metaverse, like interoperability is like a wonderful, wonderful thing. Thing practically, I don't understand. I don't really see like why somebody with like the audience base, like Axie Infinity or a large gaming publisher with hundreds of millions of players has any incentive around bleeding their audience into another ecosystem. So I really see it as like, with nfTs, interoperability is always like an option, right? Like, but I see kind of like smaller projects and blockchain games maybe like trying to help each other out, like drive audience by allowing that interoperability. But like, it's kind of like the flow goes one way. Like there's no, there's not kind of, it's difficult for there to be an incentive for like a large, like, game to want to bleed users like, downstream.
00:48:59.654 - 00:49:38.738, Speaker B: That that's a separate issue from like, oh, idealistically, like, should it, right? Like I'm kind of separating the two. And then there's a practical, like, you know, questions. For example, if I have a sword and it's like this, this much power in one game, how do you just like port that into another game and like not blow up like the game economy in that other game? So like, how do you coordinate that? I can see it a lot more easily with a skin. Let's say I have a, I have a cool hat that I bought, like, for my avatar in one game. I want to port that over to another game, that'd be super cool, right. Then I, my avatar, I keep my, my identity and I can keep that in mind any cross game. Like, that's cool concepts.
00:49:38.738 - 00:50:14.210, Speaker B: But like porting a game with power cross game, I don't, that's difficult. And I think for anybody who can't actually articulate like, how that works, but talks about interoperability just means like, you haven't thought about it. And then the second thing is like, people use different gaming engines, right? Some people might use unity. Some people might use like, unreal. And so how do you then do interoperability when there's a different engine in the backend? There's a lot of practical questions I think people haven't really asked themselves. But I think like, like, you know, in the future, if I can start using items across multiple assets as a player, right. I would get a lot of value out of that.
00:50:14.210 - 00:50:18.214, Speaker B: I think there's like less incentive for the actual like game maker to do that.
00:50:19.154 - 00:50:20.722, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really interesting.
00:50:20.898 - 00:50:32.276, Speaker C: Somewhere in here is somewhere in here, though, is some like important revelation about like what loot is. Right. Either like how loot can, can you be super useful or how loot is actually a really stupid idea. Right.
00:50:32.300 - 00:50:32.532, Speaker A: You can.
00:50:32.548 - 00:50:38.036, Speaker C: I think you can make both arguments. Um, I don't necessarily want to get into it right now, but, um.
00:50:38.140 - 00:50:39.664, Speaker A: Or, no, I was.
00:50:40.084 - 00:50:55.234, Speaker C: But it's some, something around that, right. It's like, okay, so it's like you have this community of 3000 people or something that are really passionate about it. So it's like, okay, if you integrate loot into your game, like maybe you can get these 3000, like pretty passionate, maybe pretty rich people to like, take a look at your game. Right?
00:50:55.324 - 00:51:20.270, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, it's, I was thinking that too. I was also just thinking there's a good chance if loot works out. It really doesn't become one game. It becomes several games. Is there this sort of like interoperability of this common set of things? But yeah, there's a lot of interesting ways of thinking about that. But I'm just, I am so psyched for the first game on game vampire attack and I really want to cover that story. So I'm hopeful.
00:51:20.270 - 00:51:21.902, Speaker A: We got to that here. So.
00:51:21.918 - 00:51:22.270, Speaker B: Okay.
00:51:22.342 - 00:51:39.114, Speaker A: We're about out of time, it sounds like. Amy, you have some kind of answer to this question. We're at a Solana event. I've never really heard anything about games on Solana. Is there anything going on there that either of you can tell us about? It sounds like Amy maybe, you know, a little bit there. You can't maybe tell as much as you know. But what's, what's up with gaming and Solana?
00:51:39.774 - 00:52:09.522, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of the leading blockchains to go after this category. It's the most, it's the fastest through. I know they're having some skill. They're working on some scalability issues right now as we speak. But, but I think, like, about that this morning. Yeah, fundamentally, I mean, this is, this, this blockchain's got the highest throughput, I think, of any blockchain. And I mean, obviously there's a few others, Ronin, et cetera, like that, that can really, like, pour, that can really support a game, but really not everybody can.
00:52:09.522 - 00:52:44.804, Speaker B: And Solana can. And they also have like a pretty awesome dedicated team there to support players that want to play on the, that want to build games on the ecosystem. So I think Jeff mentioned Orori. I mean, star Atlas, there's like a number of others. There's also ecosystem players, like infrastructure players like, that are starting to, like, start us, that are starting to be built so that it really helps facilitate game makers who want to build on Solana to do so in a faster, easier way. And so, yeah, we're pretty excited about the. Amy kisses him on Solana.
00:52:48.264 - 00:52:51.324, Speaker A: Jeff, you have any insights or is Amy our expert there?
00:52:52.864 - 00:53:33.004, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you know, I think Solana is pretty interesting. And I think, like, it's maybe a good place for people who are kind of like, you know, just learning how to build on web3 to get, get started. So, yeah, you know, I think to be honest, like, yeah, I'm. I think, like, more. More playgrounds for experimentation around NFTs are needed. I also think, like, I also, like, I believe that we're going to need many different scaling solutions for games because, like, the blocks are going to get full on Ethereum, L2 on slot, maybe like, that's what was causing the issues today, too. Right? So it's like, I think we're going to need many different scaling solutions.
00:53:33.004 - 00:54:19.274, Speaker C: Our approach with Ronin, which is basically axies custom scaling solution, is going to be, I think we want to start out at least a little bit like Nintendo, where we have our own nice in house ip, and then maybe we'll partner with some very select ip that kind of meets our standard and our brand, if that makes sense. Basically, I think our brand is introducing the world to something that's very scary, blockchain through something that's cute and relatable and nostalgic. So if you see titles that you know are doing that, I think we'll be doing that. So anyways, I think that there's a universe where we'll need many, many of these hopefully if the space goes exponential as I think we predict in the next five years or so.
00:54:19.694 - 00:54:56.014, Speaker A: Well, thanks a ton to Jeff Zerlin, co founder of Sky Mavis, which is behind Axie Infinity, which this conversation made pretty clear. And Amy Wu of Lightspeed, dedicated gamer and investor at Lightspeed Ventures. My name is Brady Dale. I'm a reporter with the Defiant and I will definitely be covering the story of games and blockchains developing over this next year and into the next one. So hope to see you all as that story develops. And I hope we're all there to watch close at hand when the first vampire attack game on game happens because that's going to be amazing. Thanks, everybody.
00:54:56.354 - 00:54:56.954, Speaker B: Thanks, Brody.
