00:00:18.680 - 00:00:31.442, Speaker A: Hey, guys, my name is Darren. I'll be the moderator for this session. We are going to talk about what's coming next after all time highs. So before we begin, can everyone just give a round of introductions? Who wants to go first?
00:00:31.578 - 00:00:32.334, Speaker B: Scott.
00:00:32.754 - 00:00:39.294, Speaker C: Hey, guys. I'm Santiago. Also punk 9159, and I guess I'm an angel investor.
00:00:41.594 - 00:00:49.174, Speaker D: This is Arthur from founding partner of Defiance Capital. We are defi focused crypto investment fund. Yeah, we've been investing in Solana as well.
00:00:50.034 - 00:01:04.794, Speaker B: It's julian Butalou. I'm the founder of stake Capital. So I represent not Stackdao today, but stake capital, and I've been investing in the space for quite some time. We also invest massively in Solana at the beginning, and. Yeah, so.
00:01:04.954 - 00:01:05.402, Speaker A: Got it.
00:01:05.418 - 00:01:05.586, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:05.610 - 00:01:20.604, Speaker A: Thanks for the introductions. Given that you guys are all defi native, you guys have all invested in the space, and we are currently looking at all time highs for bitcoin, especially as well as Ethereum and Solana, what do you guys think about Defi here, and how do you guys think it can evolve from here, given that we're already at all time highs?
00:01:21.144 - 00:01:40.032, Speaker C: Yeah, look, I mean, it's like, an interesting question, but it's also not an interesting question, because no one really knows, like, predicting these markets. Like, even bitcoin is in price discovery. You know, when you think about how many people, you walk outside and you think how many people actually understand crypto, how many people have used crypto, and it's less than 0.1% of the world's population. So, like, if you. Let's just start there. But, okay.
00:01:40.032 - 00:02:20.654, Speaker C: We've seen a lot of price action bitcoins gone. You know, everything is an all time highs, not only in crypto, I guess, but I think it's important to just remember we are at a point where this technology is being used, and that wasn't the case in 2017. And I think now you have a lot of infrastructure that can support more users, and so there's obviously market cycles. But the analogy that I'll make is software as a service. So you had the Internet boom in the nineties, and then it was a big crash for two, three years, and then you had software as a service come, like, 2001, and you've been over the last 20 years of this massive, massive transformation in software. And I think crypto is hitting that point. Are we going to see a correction? Normally, things.
00:02:20.654 - 00:02:49.914, Speaker C: Sometimes narratives get too ahead of fundamentals, but there's also defi when you look at relative to, I guess, NFTs and gaming, which I'm more increasingly interested in is sort of in this kind of left four dead. If you compare it against e charts or just against some other, like Solana or bitcoin, you know, crypto markets are curious because people love to chase narratives and they forget that there's been a lot of traction in Defi. It's, you know, a pretty resilient financial system that has been built over the last couple years.
00:02:50.414 - 00:03:20.058, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think that even after Q two, the Defi, from a price perspective has not been performing. When you look at the fundamental metrics, there's actually still a lot of growth. And like Aave actually has been hitting their all time high in TVL, like $30 billion. I think as of like two weeks ago, this is even higher than the may top, but the price is still like 50% below the all time high. So I think it's just like the market right now. The attention is not really in the so called defi blue chips.
00:03:20.058 - 00:04:00.392, Speaker D: It's just because the narrative is shifting very quickly and there's a lot more exciting things for most people to get involved with, such as NFT and gaming. And I think I want to borrow some. Like the quotes by Kane, he mentioned that financial services are ultimately quite infrastructure for most of the normal people. So in terms of the attention it captures is naturally going to be a lot less broader compared to NFT and gaming, because NFT gaming and the stuff is culture and finance is just finance, right? You do not talk to your friends about your finance that much compared to the other cultural stuff. So I think that is the reason. But there's still a lot of growth. And when you look at the growth rate, the multi chain future is definitely happening.
00:04:00.392 - 00:04:32.006, Speaker D: We've been pretty ETH centric until beginning of the year. And right now I think we just very convinced that Solana have hit exit velocity. I mean, I mentioned on my tweet that phantom have 1 million weekly active user right now, and it took metamask four years to achieve that number. So we can definitely see the growth accelerating. So the DeFi ecosystem on other chain, mainly Solana and a few others as well, it's definitely growing faster from a percentage perspective. But on the absolute capital, everyone is growing. Eve as well, is all growing as well.
00:04:32.006 - 00:05:10.124, Speaker D: So I think that's what is happening. And when you talk about, like, I think people ask me about the opinion on DeFi 2.0, I think a lot of them actually still building on a foundation set up by the so called Defi blue chips. So there's definitely some innovation there, but I think when you look at price, it's mostly narrative driven. Yeah. And I think in terms of the adoption, my prediction is in the next six to twelve months, we are going to see a lot of the more forward looking fintech companies start to integrate Defi as part of their product offering. The user will interact through the front end of all these fintech company, but the back end will be integrated through the Defi services.
00:05:10.124 - 00:05:34.378, Speaker D: I think this is something that can probably push the adoption of Defi very fast and very big in that sense. I think also us have a slightly more advanced progress on this compared to the other part of the world, like Asia and Europe. I think it's still falling behind. So. But us is really catching really fast on that one. So, yeah, I think that's what I see about DeFi right now. But, yeah, it's definitely still growing very quickly.
00:05:34.378 - 00:05:37.974, Speaker D: It's just a narrative is probably not here that much at the moment.
00:05:38.834 - 00:06:44.072, Speaker B: Yeah, good points. I think what we like seeing right now, it's completely different from 2017 from the bull market that we had before. Because when the market pumped in 2017 an all time high, there was like a lot of FUD and institutions and central, like governments, they were fighting crypto, they were fighting blockchain. They were calling, like, the technology of fraud a scam, bitcoin being a scam, and blockchain. Well, what we're seeing in all time high right now is the adoptions of the blockchain and all those different projects that we're building. So I think, like, back then, that was pretty risky to call it, like, no corrections on the market. But right now, considering that all the countries in the world, like central bank, digital currencies, institutions like Facebook released the metaverse, all the different keywords are now being adopted by the traditional finance and also, like, normal companies.
00:06:44.072 - 00:07:40.412, Speaker B: So I believe, like, the market will still, like, grow up in a short term, like, also like medium term. And as mentioned, Artu is very interesting that right now we've been trying to build protocols and all competing to each other on a protocols level, but in short term, what's going to happen, and we also like seeing it is like a lot of different projects are now starting to build on top of those protocols. So not just fighting them, not trying to find the new auto market maker or like the new Dex, what we're seeing is because those decks, those auto market maker, are already sufficiently super good and they're doing the job. So now it's pretty difficult to compete with them. So now what people are doing, they're building on top of them. So now we entering the layer three. I mean, so L2 was like how we can connect to all those different blockchains, bridges and interaction on defi space.
00:07:40.412 - 00:07:47.824, Speaker B: And now what we're entering is like layer three, how we build projects that are talking to all these different projects, blockchains and protocols.
00:07:48.604 - 00:08:11.624, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. Thanks for the answers. I think given that you guys must see a lot of new projects coming up, you guys have mentioned that you guys are interested in a bunch of different categories. Like you mentioned nfts and you mentioned gaming as well. So could you just tell me more about your thesis for these new sectors? What are the new projects that you guys are investing in? Given that it's already all time highs, what are the new things that you guys are positioning yourself into?
00:08:12.324 - 00:08:46.592, Speaker C: Yeah, from my perspective, I'm still very interested in Defi. I think though I've increasingly spent more and more time thinking about nfts and gaming. Not to say that I've lost conviction in Defi. I actually think it's going to be exponential in terms of adoption, because you play a game, it's very familiar, you collect an NFT. Over the last ten years, I've tried to explain this technology to people and it's been quite difficult. Why would you? Normally, people are not thinking about storing their wealth and thinking about money or their finances, but they love playing games, they love collecting. It's a social sport and it makes it very relatable.
00:08:46.592 - 00:09:20.656, Speaker C: And that's what's super exciting. You come, you play a game and then you say, what else can I do here? And so I think that's where we are in terms of adoption. And so increasingly I've spent time investing in games, investing in nfts, and then thinking about, you know, how does that, how does the user then interact in this metaverse? And I think ultimately, you know, they're going to be thinking about, okay, I want to swap x token for another. I want to think about savings. And I think ultimately our relationship with money is changing in a very profound way. Especially look at younger generations. They have no semblance of what a traditional bank account is, but they do have, they love wallets, they love collecting.
00:09:20.656 - 00:09:46.624, Speaker C: And ultimately how we think about value. Obviously bitcoin came and said, hey, well, you can have a non sovereign store of value and what's the like, you don't stop there. An NFT could be, you know, another token could be equally good, certainly in game currency, but also can be used, can be thought of as Defi. So I'm spending a lot of time at this intersection of what I see as Defi and games and collectibles.
00:09:46.924 - 00:10:17.514, Speaker D: Yeah, I think for us it's definitely gaming. I always like to talk about that. We are one of the earliest investors in XC Infinity, I think because we see the potential for play to earn. I myself as a gamer, and I think that the setting is we probably have invested two years into some MMORPG, become like a top guild, whatever. When you stop playing it, all these things are just gone. You can't even salvage any of it. So I always see there are some value in play to earn and incorporating the NFT elements into it.
00:10:17.514 - 00:10:42.912, Speaker D: And I think the success of Ski axie Infinity have definitely proved this. So, yeah, we see a lot more gaming project raising right now. And yeah, we've been investing heavily into them. I would say on average, probably the last two months, half of our deal flows that we committed has been crypto gaming and NFT projects. So all of that, we are largely defi focused. We still get investing in a lot of high quality gaming projects. And so I think that's one.
00:10:42.912 - 00:11:32.922, Speaker D: Another one, I think is like, I'm not sure it's part of gaming, but it's intersection of gaming and the whole digital economy, so called the metaverse. I think it's my belief that in quite a number of developing countries, the total economic value to be generated from the digital world might exceed their physical world as well. Just because the meat space are not catching fast enough, like the exit infinity, the wage they can earn there is way higher than the minimum wage of Philippines, for example. Mostly. So, yeah, I think this is a huge thing. One of the biggest reason that we're very bullish on gaming is, I think, one of the few categories that can be detached from the cyclical nature of crypto. Because I always think that if you have a cash flow when bitcoin go down, it doesn't mean those things should be affected.
00:11:32.922 - 00:12:01.004, Speaker D: But that's not how the market behave right now. But what I see is for gaming, even when the market crashed 60 70%, people are still going to play the game. And if we see the adoption increasing, I think the market will slowly recognize that has nothing to do market can go down 80% gamers are still going to play. We've seen Axie Infinity leading the market during June, July ish. So I think that is something that can potentially be detached from the cyclical nature of the crypto market, which is why we are very bullish as well.
00:12:03.904 - 00:12:36.682, Speaker B: What we've seen. And I think it's really interesting. And you mentioned it, Axie infinity create. Now if you go to Philippines, the excess is more valuable than the national currency, like in some part of the country. Like it's pretty sick. And you start to understand like what we're moving. And I think Sancho mentioned it is we'll soon see that money is a different concept of what we were used to.
00:12:36.682 - 00:13:36.656, Speaker B: Like basically all those different projects will have their own currency or their own kind of like way of interacting with the project. And what we've seen with Axie Infinity and we built for example two years ago Blackpool, which is a quantitative hedge fund for the NFT market. So we've been investing a lot in the NFT markets, building guilds to play those play to earn games. And what we've seen in Philippines is actually those people over there getting paid with the excess than actually the money over there. And now you understand that people are more getting into this kind of a new paradigm where the money from those gaming, from the gaming industry or from those different projects is actually more valuable than national currency. And that's why countries like national, like governments, they now fighting, fighting back because they're losing control. When you're losing control of money in your country, you're basically losing control of monopoly, like pushing for like regulations and pushing for different stuff that you want to happen in your country.
00:13:36.656 - 00:14:03.144, Speaker B: We did investment in Soha, the football fantasy game. It's one of the biggest valuation on the market. Equity based 3.5 billion. We had a game in this early stage and the same now people prefer to get paid in those nfts than actually receiving normal salaries. So what we're seeing is a complete new paradigm on the money side and the adoption of those NFTs on the market.
00:14:04.324 - 00:14:15.516, Speaker A: Do you guys think this is like the future? Like people are getting paid to work digitally. People are getting paid in the digital space rather than in real life. And physically, is this the future of work? What do you guys think of that?
00:14:15.660 - 00:14:17.172, Speaker B: I will add something. Sorry, go ahead.
00:14:17.228 - 00:14:18.420, Speaker C: Oh, no, go for it.
00:14:18.532 - 00:15:03.908, Speaker B: You know, I tweeted about it and there was like some 40 chairs, people criticizing like 70 people in the team. And the reality is like those people, they want to get paid in tokens. And if we start talking, you're going to get paid in euros, you're going to paid in us dollars. They're like what about receiving tokens? What about receiving equity? Like kind of equity? What about like getting incentivized from the from the native, from the intrinsic value of the project that I'm working on. And this is like, completely different from centuries of, like, workforce. Like, what we really see is like, if you want to work in a protocol, get involved in the DAO, get involved in a project, those people, they want to receive the direct value, direct incentive from those projects.
00:15:04.076 - 00:15:04.332, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:04.348 - 00:15:22.848, Speaker C: It's like two really powerful concepts of crypto web. Three, generally. One, open source systems are better than closed systems. They invite people to come and build. And from a developer perspective, you have the certainty that you're not going to get rugged when you're building on top of Facebook and Google. They can just shut off access to you. And now you have incredibly kind of neutral or, like, platform that you can come and build.
00:15:22.848 - 00:15:55.436, Speaker C: And I think the compounding effects of innovation of open source systems are radically faster, like, relative to web two. And so for that reason, we're going to see so many different use cases that we're not even thinking about today, and which opens up new economic possibilities. You know, play to earn is one, but it doesn't stop there, right? I mean, artists are not going direct to their communities. You can share royalties, all kinds of different possibilities. Right. Which is why I think there's a multiverse here. It's not just Ethereum, it's not just Solana, because ultimately these blockchains are going to be perhaps, you know, servicing different use cases.
00:15:55.436 - 00:15:58.740, Speaker C: And the other component is obviously capturing value for your contributions.
00:15:58.892 - 00:15:59.324, Speaker D: Right?
00:15:59.404 - 00:16:25.838, Speaker C: I mean, in traditional open source systems, like, you didn't capture much value. Like, Tim Berners Lee isn't the richest man today because he couldn't capture much value. It's other people, like Facebook, that built on top of that this infrastructure that is open for everyone. But crypto just came along and put a token wrapper to it and said, anyone that contributes can benefit, and that's just not developers. It's literally everyone in these communities. And that, I think, radically transforms societies in very powerful ways. And so, you know, in the metaverse.
00:16:25.838 - 00:16:45.458, Speaker C: Yeah, it's gonna be crazy. Probably wilder than, like, minority report. You're gonna have digital, you know, real estate agents. You're gonna have land. Yeah, maybe a parcel of land in Decentraland gets more visits than Times Square. And I don't think we're too far away from that, especially when you layer on, like, virtual reality and, like, haptic feedback and, like, you're. You're really immersed in these games and so.
00:16:45.546 - 00:16:49.722, Speaker B: But I hope it's not controlled by Facebook, right? Yeah, I hope we build our own metaverse.
00:16:49.818 - 00:16:50.274, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:16:50.314 - 00:16:52.778, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't really trust mark. Yeah.
00:16:52.866 - 00:16:53.042, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:53.058 - 00:17:11.304, Speaker C: I think with COVID people sort of realize you're at home and I don't think it's going away. Like, obviously, like certain things that you're, when you just have to be inside, you're playing more games and stuff. But. But I think more and more it's this ability to interact with anyone in the world in a very immersive way in these open communities that is truly kind of transformational, for my opinion.
00:17:12.204 - 00:17:50.030, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think one thing I probably want to add is the NFT. Santiago is a huge NFT collector here. I mean, one of the biggest game changing factor that NFT bring into its entirely new distribution channel for artists, you know, anyone who produced digital work, any way to monetize it and interact with their community directly. And I can tell you this one doesn't really exist. And most of the artists be like musicians, like actual artists, they're actually massively underpaid. I think in us it's a little bit better.
00:17:50.030 - 00:18:19.406, Speaker D: Like, if you're a musician, there's still some way for you to generate income, but actually, for someone who's familiar with the music industry, a lot of the revenue have actually come from concert instead of actually selling the song. I think that, like, NFT might actually change that. Especially in Asia. Like the Asia I know a lot of the revenue actually has in the music industry has been falling through a cliff. It's just not, there's no good way to monetize it. Like Spotify, the revenue is too small. But I think this whole NFT is like, it's an entire news distribution channel that's changing the game.
00:18:19.406 - 00:18:45.634, Speaker D: And also for artists, it's finding an easier way for people to price their art and for them to monetize it and, you know, get more value accrued to them in a way. And I think that's a huge, because this is probably the most, like, underpriced work in the world. It's just so hard. And usually the artists and musicians, they are not the most commercially acute. They don't have the best commercial acumen, generally speaking. So I think this is huge. Yeah.
00:18:47.854 - 00:18:48.794, Speaker B: Got it.
00:18:50.274 - 00:18:55.974, Speaker A: Let me think. I mean, given that we already here.
00:18:56.394 - 00:18:57.614, Speaker D: We talk about Solana.
00:18:58.114 - 00:19:09.034, Speaker A: You guys want to talk about other chains? What do you guys think? Do you think that Solana has a chance to flip an ethan as the next major layer, one chain? Or are you guys still just massive eve bulls?
00:19:09.114 - 00:19:53.512, Speaker C: Well, okay, so how do we define the flippening? Because ETH has already flipped bitcoin in terms of adoption, in terms of transactions, in terms of protocols built on top of. That's sort of the flipping that I look at, obviously, like people are obsessed with prices. That's fine. But like, from my perspective, like ETH is, or the possibility to capture value for these blockchains, whether it's Solana or Ethereum, is vastly, vastly, as Arthur's saying, you know, your digital gold is what, eight, like, gold is $8 trillion market, give or take. And I guess, like, bitcoin's trying to do that, and we've always kind of been anchored to that number. But it's one, not zero sum, right? Bitcoin can capture that fine. But Ethereum and Solana and these other blockchains are just going to create so much value because there's new use cases and possibilities.
00:19:53.512 - 00:20:24.756, Speaker C: So the Internet's vastly larger than gold. But yeah. Can the Solana flip Ethereum? I mean, it's an interesting question. I mean, I think, first of all, I think anyone that's here or listening can look at this event and the quality of teams here and be radically surprised. That's from my perspective, it's been a very pleasant experience being here. And, you know, I don't know, it'd be interesting to watch. Probabilistically, there is a version of this world where Solana flips Ethereum, but that doesn't mean that Ethereum goes away again.
00:20:24.756 - 00:20:30.172, Speaker C: I just sort of think that Ethereum serves a different use case. Then perhaps Solana is more well suited for social and gaming or something.
00:20:30.268 - 00:21:06.574, Speaker D: Yeah, I think as an investor, you always try to think in a probabilistic manner as much as possible. I think I mentioned in some of my tweets or podcasts, I think the chances of Solana flippant, if probably in three years, is probably. I would assign like 1020 percent six months ago or like three months ago. Right now, I'll probably put it around 40% to 50%. I still think if it's going to be very dominant, I think the value accrual is underestimated. And when the merge happen, you're going to see a lot of the supply getting staked. A lot of the proof of stake blockchain, like up to 60% of supply are being staked.
00:21:06.574 - 00:21:41.304, Speaker D: I think for Ethereum, you're probably gonna see like up to 30%. So that's gonna be huge change in the supply dynamic. I think for Solana, this same dynamic exists, but the growth of Solana is definitely like way happening, way faster pace than Ethereum right now because it starts from a smaller base and obviously you have the big scalability challenge that is already being partially solved. But I guess it really depends on what's your market view as well. Like if you think this is a super cycle, which is something I believe in. I think the chances of Solana Fibonacci if it's quite high, it's just because it's more prime for growth. It's a blockchain that built for growth.
00:21:41.304 - 00:22:07.776, Speaker D: For Ethereum, there's a lot more smart money that the OG that inside that in a bear market, they are more able to keep the use case going. Solana, I think that we haven't really seen a real bear market yet. So it's not. It's a bit hard to say how the community will react with the price drop, let's say 70% and stay there for six months and one year. We haven't yet to see it yet. So I think it would be a good test to the community. But if the super cycle.
00:22:07.776 - 00:22:27.524, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the chances of Solana flipping Eve is quite high just because this blockchain is primed for growth and to onboard like 100 million of users, which Ethereum still not very clear how they will get there yet. There's a lot of scaling solution, but it's like there might be multiple that works. You're not 100% sure which one is the one that going to do it.
00:22:28.514 - 00:23:22.098, Speaker B: Yeah, I see Santango mentioned Solana being a complete like different use case for me also being walking on the curve finance, which is like biggest auto market maker for stable coins. And you want to build like FX market. I mean the effects market is between three and $5 billion trading volume per day. So we haven't reached that volume of trading in the blockchain space. So if the entire like central digital currency coming into the market, that will enter 1 trillion, 2 trillion us dollar volume per day. And this will be captured for chains that go faster than Ethereum. So for example, Solana is probably the best position to do like the effects market on top of decentralized exchanges.
00:23:22.098 - 00:23:55.622, Speaker B: I know like the. At the moment everyone is talking about nfts. I see NFT like in 2017 when there was like ICO market and people were all jumping into the ICO market and there was like 99% of the entire space was just bullshit. But then 1% of the space actually create all those different projects that we have like Aave and all these different things. I think it's exactly happening the same in the NFT market. Like a lot of people, like bootstrapping some landing page quick nfts. People hate degen inside.
00:23:55.622 - 00:24:55.390, Speaker B: But the true value of those things had not happened yet. So what we want to see is a complete new layer of application being built on top of it. And this is what happened like a couple months or a year or two years after the boom. So, for example, ICO, it took like two years, three years to come into the market of many different applications, like lending market makers, auto market makers, and then different applications on top of it, like Multisig, Nosisafe, basically the different projects that are needed to build a decentralized financial world. And that's exactly what happened in the traditional market in the nineties and in 2000. So what we're seeing in the NFT market, I think right now, we're talking about gpegs and other things, but people are now building the next phase of the NFT market. And I think we'll enter soon in this concept of we don't care, users don't care that it's actually being used or powered by blockchain, just use the applications.
00:24:55.390 - 00:25:34.692, Speaker B: And actually, users don't care. It's actually an NFT behind the scene. They will just like play the application, use the applications. And this is where things get super interesting. It's like when we enter this world where you don't need to understand that it's DNS, HTTPs, or any other protocols being powered, the application that you're using, and Facebook is going to inject 15 billion into the thing, fight legal regulation and all this thing. Good, because for us, we can then start building on top of this boom. And so, coming back to the question of Solana, I think Solana is actually very well positioned for the true quantitative trading, algorithmic trading.
00:25:34.692 - 00:26:24.274, Speaker B: And this is what myself I'm looking into and investing a lot in this, in this market. Nfts are good, but nfts without application on the side, it's a little bit strange to me. But then if you mix high frequency trading, FX market application from the tradition, whatever we're building in decentralized finance is not new, is being just copied and passed from traditional finance, but in a better technical protocols, and the technology is way better. So I think now we can start building a new paradigms, new ideas, and this is what I'm looking into. And I think Solana is really good for that. And also specially that is using a language like rust, that is not a proprietary language and not something that is built just for the specific city of the chain.
00:26:25.374 - 00:26:25.846, Speaker D: Got it.
00:26:25.870 - 00:26:45.514, Speaker A: Thanks for that. Yeah, I think there's not much time left, but then I'll just give you guys one last chance to talk about one project specifically that you guys are most excited for in the future. It can be anything. It doesn't have to be on Eve, doesn't have to be on Solana, but just one project specifically that you're most excited about that's going to launch either soon or it's already alive.
00:26:48.694 - 00:26:50.842, Speaker B: I just spoke. Go for it.
00:26:51.018 - 00:26:59.138, Speaker D: I mean, I'm wearing an aave t shirt, so. Yeah, I'm gonna say I'm still very bullish on Aave. I think they just announced that they're gonna deploy on neon.
00:26:59.186 - 00:26:59.706, Speaker B: Is it?
00:26:59.810 - 00:27:29.782, Speaker D: Yeah. Which is EVM compatible scaling solution like this anchor to Solana. So, yeah, I think that among all the Defi team, they're the one that, you know, have always been on point on the execution. Yeah, the metrics are good. It's just that market is not realizing it. Yeah, I think that this is what the kind of thing you need to build defi, you need to balance the growth and the innovation together with the security as well. I mean, recently there's a minor issue, but it also, like, was a patch up in a very quick manner as well.
00:27:29.782 - 00:28:09.494, Speaker D: So there was no, nothing, no damage was done in the end. So, yeah, I think I'm very bullish on Aave, and I think in terms of gaming, I'm really looking forward to. I don't have any specific names. Really looking forward to, like, games that's close to AAAA quality being launched, at least on an alpha manner that have a deeper blockchain integration. Because I think right now, the criticism on a game is not really the game that a lot of the people want to play right now. So I hope that this kind of game can launch and prove that it's possible to get a AAA level game that integrated with the blockchain.
00:28:09.794 - 00:28:31.034, Speaker C: Yeah, just anchoring off of that. I mean, no surprise. I'm really excited about games one. None of this is financial advice, by the way, but one is illuvium. It's super immersive. I mean, what Axie has showed us is it's tapping a very powerful nerve. Like, Axie went from nothing to, like, having millions of users and, like, supporting economies of, like, Vietnam, Philippines and other places.
00:28:31.034 - 00:29:01.788, Speaker C: This idea of play to earn is like, like Uber and Airbnb came and, like, made, you know, create entirely new jobs for people. I think gaming is going to do that in web3. And one of those games is super immersive like Axie is, to your point, these games in crypto being kind of very simple. The logic has been, hasn't been truly kind of immersive. Illuvium, in my opinion, is probably going to be the first game that launches probably in q one that is super immersive. So go check out their discord. I mean, one of the developers was part of the crew of Lord of the Rings.
00:29:01.788 - 00:29:10.264, Speaker C: And so it's super immersive and it shows in the quality of the game. So I'm really excited to play the game and see how other people interact with it. So. Yeah, that's just one.
00:29:10.604 - 00:30:05.974, Speaker B: Yeah, completely agree. Illuvium is pretty dope. But I think for me, we enter a new phase when we start, like when those big gaming studio also start building games that are on blockchain. Not just using blockchain, but maybe also like, like kind of like, like not using nfts or like items. And also like being like, for example, using Solana technology to power the gaming, the game. But Ubisoft and all those different big gaming companies in the world, as soon as they start entering that market, I see we'll see like a huge potential, like pretty new phase in the gaming industry and blockchain. Because right now it's like, it's agree it's immersive, but it's kind of like, it's not like as a FPS or like a big 3d gaming that you play inside.
00:30:05.974 - 00:30:34.424, Speaker B: I want to see something like using blockchain. And then the other aspect is like big companies that we're using today that are fully jumping into blockchain, such as Twitter or maybe TikTok, Facebook. All those different big companies that now starting to get involved. I just wonder what will happen to the blockchain industry as soon as they get into it. And also then on a financial market, like big banking system, obviously this is pretty big.
00:30:35.564 - 00:30:47.412, Speaker A: Got it. Thanks for your answers, guys. I think that's all the time that we have. But what's the best way for everyone in the audience to reach you if they have any other questions, whether they follow you on Twitter or so on. Like, what's the best way for you guys?
00:30:47.508 - 00:30:48.708, Speaker B: Sync. Twitter. Yeah.
00:30:48.836 - 00:30:50.236, Speaker C: Crypto. Twitter. Yeah, yeah, Twitter.
00:30:50.260 - 00:30:52.536, Speaker D: Yeah. My DM is open. I guess the same for everyone.
00:30:52.660 - 00:30:54.360, Speaker B: It. Yeah. All right.
00:30:54.432 - 00:30:57.184, Speaker A: Thanks for your time, guys. Thanks for your time, everyone as well in the audience.
00:30:57.264 - 00:31:00.104, Speaker C: Thanks, guys. Cool.
