00:00:02.920 - 00:00:19.594, Speaker A: Okay. Alrighty. Hi everybody, my name is Courtney. I am with Solana Foundation. I am an ecosystem engineer. And would you like to go ahead and introduce yourself, even though you need no introduction? Marina?
00:00:19.974 - 00:00:28.534, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Thank you. I'm Marina Guriva. I am running neon Labs, which stands behind the EVM.
00:00:29.434 - 00:00:38.974, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so I think the question that everybody here has, you were here last year, right? And what have you been working on in the past year?
00:00:39.914 - 00:01:21.634, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the main question and the most frequent one. And we've been focusing a lot on development basically for the last twelve months, as we have done a lot in terms of development. You can see here on the slide the number of core code lines that were changed, more than 650,000. And we ran more than 4000 tests on our software. So in order to ensure that each and every product of ours is safe for usage. And we also did integration. So I talked last year here about integrations, how important they are for the Ethereum depths.
00:01:21.634 - 00:02:05.274, Speaker B: And we did, did manage to accomplish those with the graph, for example, on yon scan, on wormhole. And we also battle tested ethereum depth and it was a very crucial part for us. So we launched Neonivm on Solana Devnet in April. And so, and we did battle testing during summer. And we pick up different ethereum depths from different categories in order to check that all of them can be deployed easily and safely on yawn. And the result that we have right now, they are very satisfactory. So each and every depth can be deployed on yawn.
00:02:05.274 - 00:02:48.714, Speaker B: And we definitely ran a lot of security audits. It's like the paramount thing for each and every product. And we've been working with great audit companies and we did eight audits. The results are on our GitHub, so you can check, you can learn a lot from them. But like, we are satisfied with the results right now. We also build our community. So we have more than 60,000 people joining us and we are more than happy to have them because like, we do understand that the future of neon depends a lot on community.
00:02:48.714 - 00:03:12.710, Speaker B: And we love them because we've been building for the last twelve months, but they were together with us, waiting patiently for us to go live to Solano mania. So that's something. And we also had a lot of conversations with different Ethereum dapps ready to go to Solana Vineyard. And so we have all of them in our pipeline.
00:03:12.822 - 00:03:27.940, Speaker A: That is so exciting. I come from the Ethereum world, so building from EVM to Solana, and I've even used neon. I deployed adapt using neon. And it was so easy, so seamless, deployed. I was like, wow, this is it. Like, I did it. This is great, but I do okay.
00:03:27.940 - 00:03:31.144, Speaker A: So what challenges did you come across in the process?
00:03:31.444 - 00:04:05.074, Speaker B: Okay, a lot. So we have a very talented engineering team. But like, even for us, it was a bit too hard. I would say so because, like, you should understand, ethereum differs totally from Solana. It's like you took two different galaxies and you compare them. And this is like how we see Ethereum ecosystem and Solana ecosystem, understanding both of them quite well. So here you can see some of the challenges that we resolved successfully.
00:04:05.074 - 00:04:56.628, Speaker B: I would love to mention one of those. And this is the number of counts that can be packed into one Solana transaction. So when the partners of ours started testing a focal father in summer, so they ran into a huge, huge issue. Our deposit functionality needed more than 100 Solana accounts to be packed into one Solana transaction. And you might know that the standard limit for Solana was in summer 32. And they had just implemented v two Solana transaction functionality, which allows now to put 64 Solana accounts into one Solana transaction. And so what we did, we did a lot of optimizations.
00:04:56.628 - 00:05:42.868, Speaker B: Basically, we enabled support of Solana functionality. And then we also managed to peg more ethereum contract sales into one Solana account. And so, and thus we reduce the number of Solana accounts needed for deposit functionality of father to 58 accounts. This functionality can be run easily on Solana Mainnet. And we are very happy that Solana just shift this v two functionality to mainnet after our kindly request.
00:05:42.996 - 00:05:51.796, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. Okay, so the next question, what have you built? Can you share some of these stats with us?
00:05:51.900 - 00:07:02.054, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. This is how our product looks like. So it's not just a single EVM contract, which is Solana Dapp. Essentially we also have proxy server that wraps ethereum like transactions, neon transactions into Solana transactions, because like Solana doesn't, like, deal with neon transactions, it deals with standard Solana transactions in which inside we have neon transactions packed. So we also have a very nice thin tracing API which is needed for the graph node and which we built in order to enable the functionality of the graph. And we also have what we call Neon pass in order to enable the transfer of the tokens that are breached to Solana by one hole to neon EVM. So basically they are moved to special program derived addresses that can be used by neon EVM itself.
00:07:02.054 - 00:07:42.706, Speaker B: And then we have neon faucets. So those of you who want to deploy something on neon, you will first go to Solana Devnet and then you will use neon faucet in order to get some neon tokens and other ERC 20 tokens, whatever you need. And then we have neon down. So basically what we want to have, we want to enable community to be the governing body of the neon ecosystem from the very beginning. And so we built the whole product for this neon dao.
00:07:42.810 - 00:07:45.282, Speaker A: That's so great. Sorry, go ahead.
00:07:45.378 - 00:08:22.220, Speaker B: No, no, no. It's like, it's you. Because on the slide you can see also the number of tps and the cost per transactions. And we are very, very proud about these numbers because you might know that currently on Solana, there are four concurrent streams for execution of transactions. And so we ran performance tests using the same functionality and we got 2000 TPS. And this is huge. Those of you who know the maximum number for Ethereum, I assume, you know.
00:08:22.292 - 00:08:25.184, Speaker A: I don't know, off top of my head, not very high.
00:08:26.004 - 00:08:27.364, Speaker B: 115.
00:08:27.524 - 00:08:28.372, Speaker A: No. Really?
00:08:28.468 - 00:08:29.100, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:29.252 - 00:08:30.104, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:31.804 - 00:08:51.181, Speaker B: Like, this is what we have on Solana, but it's thanks to Solana, definitely. And the cost. So in dollar terms, it's something zero point zero, five cents, I believe. Something like this, the number that we have here in terms of gas fees.
00:08:51.317 - 00:08:55.833, Speaker A: That is crazy. So tell me more about the team that built neon.
00:08:57.053 - 00:09:21.830, Speaker B: So I'm very proud about our team. So we grew significantly. So we have 46 amazing individuals, I would say so most of them are engineers. And so they're very talented engineers. And they're based in 16, I believe, countries. So you can see the flags here. So they just based across the globe.
00:09:21.830 - 00:09:32.554, Speaker B: And we also have a lot of partners, tech partners mainly. And auditing companies. Tech auditing companies. Those I love especially.
00:09:34.854 - 00:09:38.994, Speaker A: I love it. And tell me more about the ecosystem that you guys are creating.
00:09:39.334 - 00:10:00.564, Speaker B: Yeah. Here on the slide, you can see some of the logos of those products that have been of those teams, maybe of products, but tested on neon Devnet and with whom we would love to go to mainnet.
00:10:00.944 - 00:10:09.964, Speaker A: Nice. All right, so I'm pretty sure the next slide is the one that everybody has been waiting on. Neon on Mainnet. When is it coming?
00:10:10.554 - 00:10:14.370, Speaker B: The 12 December this year. So yes.
00:10:14.442 - 00:10:20.306, Speaker A: Let's go. Okay. I'm excited for this. Yes. Yeah.
00:10:20.370 - 00:10:29.434, Speaker B: I do believe that the foundation will launch this in this December. And we will see me on Solana finally.
00:10:29.554 - 00:10:36.374, Speaker A: Oh, that is so exciting. My screen just froze. So give me just. We'll go ahead and hop to the next slide.
00:10:37.524 - 00:11:23.096, Speaker B: So what's next for more engineering work? I would say so, but our engineers have already started working on this on interoperability. Basically what we want you to have at the end is the smooth communication between Ethereum Dapps deployed on neon and Solana programs and vice versa. So basically we want users to move between two ecosystem natively easily. And this is a very tricky engineering task. I would say so. But then this is something that we're excited about as an engineer. And so basically this is what we will have next year.
00:11:23.240 - 00:11:36.564, Speaker A: Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Okay, so I believe this next one is how to build. So if a developer like myself, any other developers that are out here are interested, how does it work? How can they get involved?
00:11:36.724 - 00:12:03.116, Speaker B: Easily. So you join our discord channel. So you message these Dev guys and James is here and Nick is here. And then you are a part of our team almost. So we will start talking to you and so we will help you. We have all the docs available, so. And the engineers are available for answers to any of your questions as well.
00:12:03.300 - 00:12:10.904, Speaker A: Okay, great. I believe that is all the questions that we have. So thank you very much. Did you have anything else that you would like to share?
00:12:11.964 - 00:12:26.300, Speaker B: Not exactly. I just want to invite everybody to start using yawn. Because if you were thinking about what is the best time for these, the best time is now.
00:12:26.492 - 00:12:45.436, Speaker A: It is. And it's very easy to use. Like I mentioned earlier, I was able to spin up a Dap that I already had built on EVM chains and deploy it on remix using neon. And it was immediate. I was like, oh, this is it. I was able to use your guys's scanner in order to find the id. In order to find it on Solscan.
00:12:45.436 - 00:12:51.020, Speaker A: It was so seamless and your docs are amazing. So also please check out the docs too.
00:12:51.052 - 00:12:51.220, Speaker B: Too.
00:12:51.252 - 00:12:58.104, Speaker A: You can find everything that you need within the neon docs as well. But thank you so much for your time here today.
00:12:58.684 - 00:12:59.684, Speaker B: Thanks a lot, Courtney.
