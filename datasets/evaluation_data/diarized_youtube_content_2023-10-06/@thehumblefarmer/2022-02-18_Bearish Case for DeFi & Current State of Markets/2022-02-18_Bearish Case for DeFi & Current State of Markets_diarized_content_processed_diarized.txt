00:00:00.560 - 00:00:26.254, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here. And in this video, I'll be going over the bearish case for Defi and how I'm navigating current market conditions and going over, you know, my portfolio a little bit. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Now, this is financial advice. And yeah, it's definitely not a fun time to be in the markets right now. There's a lack of capital inflow. There's, you know, everything in crypto is inflationary, you know, so if there's not new money coming in, the price on average goes down.
00:00:26.254 - 00:00:59.096, Speaker A: And. And no, just generally a lack of innovation is definitely taking a toll on the markets. There's also a buyer's strike amongst all risk assets, whether it be in the stock market, crypto, whatever. There's geopolitical uncertainty, macro uncertainty, monetary condition. Like, there's uncertainty everywhere, right? And it's natural for people to take risk off and reevaluate once all these uncertainties are cleared up. So, you know, maybe expect, no, maybe don't expect up only markets from here on out. Even you look at my YouTube metrics, like, it's like it kind of is trending down.
00:00:59.096 - 00:02:19.744, Speaker A: I guess I haven't posted that much videos recently, but, you know, like, you know, there's definitely, like, not new people, like money coming in, right? It's like people watching my channel are just, you know, like farmers that's been around since 2021, early to mid 2021, you know, and we're just like, damn, like, this market suck, right? It's like, it feels like all the energy is sucked out in markets and, yeah, definitely not a fun time to be in the markets right now. And I definitely didn't play everything perfectly either. So, you know, part of the reason why I haven't been making that many videos isn't because I'm, like, abandoning YouTube. It's just that there really isn't that much to talk about, you know, like, and I don't want to, like, start making, like, a bunch of random content, you know, for the sake of getting clicks and whatnot, you know? So I was like, should I just start making bearish videos just for the hell of it? I had a lot of comments in this, in this tweet, and I might start doing podcasts, too, just to talk to, like, you know, people that survived past bear markets in the past. But, you know, in this video, I guess I just wanted to go over, like, the bearish case for Defi just because I don't feel like people really cover these things. And I feel like people that are bearish crypto or just defi is like, oh, yeah, it's not gonna work. But I'll kind of give a case on, like, more fundamental reasons on why defis might be bearish in general.
00:02:19.744 - 00:02:53.270, Speaker A: Okay, so let's kind of go over that. So in my 2022 predictions video, I mentioned that in. Okay, so this is like early January. I'm short term, I'm bullish defi short term and long term, right. I'm optimistic in the short term and long term because short term, we could be getting more incentives, right. And, you know, I guess, like, the macro conditions were, like, less poor back then. And then long term, you know, you just bet on, like, the devs to do something, right? You bet on the devs to, you know, keep churning out quality products to keep innovating on what's already made and, you know, make Defi a flourishing space.
00:02:53.270 - 00:03:23.242, Speaker A: However, I mentioned that in the midterm, right. I'm bearish Defi and short to mid to long term, I don't really have, like, a time horizon, right. I'm just like, you know, just generally applying these concepts. But. But the reason I was midterm bearish Defi was that if you look at this defi and, like, how it's grown since 2021, it's driven off of incentives, right? Most of DeFi is incentivized. Where these foundations. Right, these l one foundations have to pay you to use their chain.
00:03:23.242 - 00:04:02.286, Speaker A: When the incentives are out, what happens? And we kind of see what's happening now, right? Like avalanche rush. Right? Like they paid you to use it. Everyone goes in, we farm, we make money, and then we're like, yeah, kumbaya, right? Phantom, right? There was announcement for incentives. We go there like it's happiness, right? It's happiness all around. But, you know, after some time, the incentives kind of go down, right? There are still incentives, but, you know, it's not as high as it used to be. And in these conditions, like defi, activities plummets. And the reason is because the truth of the matter is, like, most of these defi applications are just not good, right? It doesn't really create economic value.
00:04:02.286 - 00:04:37.906, Speaker A: It just exists to, you know, it just exists to exist, right? And if you take into account the Dex fees, right, the 0.3% Dex fees that you pay, the slippage that you pay, the gas you pay, on average, the average market participant loses money, right? Just mathematically speaking. And let's kind of go over like, you know, centralized. And in my opinion, right. I think the centralized exchange experience is much better than the decentralized exchange experience. Of course, like, you know, some assets you can't buy on a centralized exchange, but, you know, the fees are much lower on a centralized exchange. And there's like, essentially no slippage because of like, market makers, right.
00:04:37.906 - 00:05:18.212, Speaker A: And of course, you know, if you're using a Dex, right? And to be honest, like, I mostly operate on dexs. I don't really use centralized exchanges anymore. But, you know, and that's because if you're using a Dex, you're most likely just operating on chain or it's to buy, you know, low cap altcoins that aren't listed on a centralized exchange, right. And if you think about it, like, why do people buy low cap altcoins? Well, it's so that, you know, people can make money because in a bull market, you know, these low cap altcoins go up in bull markets. If we're not in a bull market, there's less reasons to use Dexs because we have to pay higher fees, higher slippage. You know, it's not that liquid. So, you know, these activity and metrics across Dexs and just, I guess, defi ecosystems in general just deteriorate.
00:05:18.212 - 00:05:49.564, Speaker A: Let's go over money markets, right? And I'm a huge proponent of money markets and why it's so important for these ecosystems to have money markets, because money markets create leverage and leverage kind of alludes to, like this point where, you know, it creates more activity on an ecosystem, right. And it can't just be any money market. It has to be a money market with incentives because every loan in DeFi is over collateralized. So, you know, it's not really capital efficient. Right. It doesn't really make sense for in most instances to take out loans. Actually, I don't want to say that, but you kind of get the point.
00:05:49.564 - 00:06:02.150, Speaker A: It's like less capital efficient. You know, money markets with incentives create leverage, right. You deposit whatever eth, right. You like, earn lending fees. You also earn incentive mining programs. You borrow stable coins. Right.
00:06:02.150 - 00:06:39.842, Speaker A: And maybe the loan is subsidized, right. You pay 3% interest in USDC, but, you know, let's say Ava labs is paying you like 3% in Avax, right? So it's like, oh, it's free money. And then you take your USDC and you stable form, or you just like, buy more Avax or, you know, buy more eth or something, right. It creates more leverage. And, you know, it creates more leverage than, I guess, it creates more buying pressure than it actually exists, right. Because people are using their collateral to, as a loan, right? And using it as collateral to like, you know, take out a loan to buy more things with it. I've definitely done this in the past, right? If you go back to, like, August, I always like leverage along Avax and I also like leveraged along phantom back in the day.
00:06:39.842 - 00:07:15.516, Speaker A: But, you know, like, in these marketing conditions, like, who the hell is doing that, right? Like, you have to be a madman, right? You have to have, you know, sailor level conviction, right? You have to be Michael Saylor, and I'm not trying to be Michael Sailor right now. You know, because the leverage creates more buy pressure. More buy pressure means wealth is created, right? Because, you know, or it's not like real wealth created. I guess it's like artificial wealth being created, right? You know, if everyone in the industry just takes on leverage and buys coins, then, you know, everything goes up. But, you know, at some point, people have to, like, take profits, right? And then price goes down. But, you know, speaking generally, you know, if number go up, then more people enter space. It's like, oh, yeah.
00:07:15.516 - 00:07:34.320, Speaker A: Like, you know, it's more more money then the wealth is created. Wealth trickles down into the risk curve. And then, you know, if more people take risk, then more all coins pump. And then more all coins pump. It's like, oh, my God, like this all coin is pumping. You know, it's like the next hundred x opportunity. And then, you know, it creates this speculative fever, I guess, around the markets.
00:07:34.320 - 00:08:04.330, Speaker A: And I guess what's happening now is that the incentives are drying up, right? I mean, there are still avalanche russian incentives. Monavi and I'm on Aave also. I'll share a screenshot. Screenshot later. But if you look at like, phantom, there's like, not that many incentives, right? Aside from, like, you know, the farm tokens and the, the project I talked about in January of Nier. I still, I'll talk about Nier later. But, you know, like, those incentives got delayed because of, like, smart contract issues and like, the blockchain issues on aura, which I'll go over.
00:08:04.330 - 00:09:07.510, Speaker A: So, you know, if there's no incentives, then there's, like, less reasons to use these chains. You know, truth is that most defined apps just aren't good. And, you know, the majority of innovation, right, I mean, innovation still occurs on other l ones, but I feel like, you know, generally, you know, like, innovation happens on eth, on Ethereum side, and then people fork that onto other l ones, which, you know, and they're still quality products, right. And you know, applications like Trader Joe, they forked like uniswap or like sushiswap or whatever and they innovate on top of that and it's actually creating value, right. Which is fine, but you know, on a general sense, most products just are not good, right? And the tokenomics are just awful in general. And it doesn't really, it doesn't mean that incentives are everything, right? If you look back into 2020, you know, there was like no ecosystem fund during DeFi summer, but you know, we still entered a bull market. But that's because DeFi was so small where like any capital inflow, it's like propped up the markets and you know, we were like experimenting, trying out aave, trying out compound food, coins, like, you know, sushi, whatever.
00:09:07.510 - 00:09:50.358, Speaker A: What I mean is that it's just easier to play in an environment where money is falling from the sky versus trying to extract value from the markets. You know, like, I mean there are definitely people like making money right now, right, in DeFi or CFI, like whatever trading, right. But you know, it's definitely harder to make money now than, you know, when Avalon trust was first being started. So I just like operating in those environments and that's why I've been kind of focused on these, I guess, ecosystems or I guess, sectors where there are going to be incentives. But you know, that's just like how I think about things and. Yeah, so let's kind of go over my allocations and it kind of reflects on this entire thesis. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:50.358 - 00:10:30.682, Speaker A: Cuz you know, without incentives you kind of have to do like just due diligence and like look for undervalued projects, which is like total, totally fine, right? I can definitely do that. But you know, it's just much easier to like make money when, you know, like Eva labs is like, you know, like throwing money in this guy, right? You know, like all these bloaters, right. Anyways, aside from the majors, right, my incentives are needed apply to how I'm currently allocated at least in the current like crypto landscape. So I mean, this is like a rough generalization. It doesn't go over like the small positions I have. But you know, I'm like over half my portfolio is in system majors and stables. I have like 15% to 20% in gamefi, 15% near eco 7% luna.
00:10:30.682 - 00:11:03.560, Speaker A: And then I have random other plays that I don't want to talk about right now. I'll touch on Gamefi first because in this post by Arthur Hayes, in December of last year. Definitely should listen to Arthur before those that don't know Arthur. You know, he was the co founder of Bitmex. He got indicted, I think. I don't really know what his current situation is, but he's a very smart person. But, you know, he said he started becoming bearish in December, you know, and he said that if you want to maintain macro crypto exposure, maybe take some risk off, and then if you have to, like maybe allocate to the metaverse play to earn NFT related.
00:11:03.560 - 00:11:52.210, Speaker A: Because the success, because the success of these themes do not hinge on global monetary conditions, but an actual change in behavior of actors whose lives can be dramatically improved by adopting new forms of the technology, which does make sense, right? Like people buying nfts, people playing axie, like they really don't care. Like if you're being liquidated on Aave, right? They really do not care. People are playing to earn because they can make money for themselves. Or people are buying nfts because, you know, it's, you know, there's like natural demand, right? There's like outside demand creating those that pressures and like metaverse. Like, I don't, I don't really know what the hell that means, but, you know, maybe more money is going to trickle in there. So for my gaming exposure, it kind of combines the incentives and the Arthur thesis. And, you know, I've talked about Defi kingdoms and Cravata, right? And those are like my top two gaming positions.
00:11:52.210 - 00:12:09.876, Speaker A: And that's because, you know, I think the teams are good. I think the, I mean, the game actually has users. You know, it's still speculative in nature. And there are like bullish technological innovation coming along with avalanche subnets along with the Rush 2.0. Right. And rush 2.0, is it going to happen? I don't know.
00:12:09.876 - 00:12:31.284, Speaker A: Right. I'm just going off of what Eva labs, their team, has been saying on Twitter. But, you know, if you can get subnets, which is a technological innovation, and then get Rush incentives, I feel like that's gonna be good for these ecosystems, right. You know, because even these play to earn games. Like, they're not, like, they're not that good, right. I mean, it's like the barrier to entry is like pretty high. You know, it's kind of hard to figure out.
00:12:31.284 - 00:13:27.394, Speaker A: Like, you know, like, is it even a game? But, you know, if you have incentives, then it's probably gonna be good, right? And going off of that, talking about the Nier ecosystem, you know, they announced this $800 million program in October, I believe. And that current price is it's over a billion dollars and you know, the incentives are coming, right. It's a question of when, not a matter of if and if. You just like, if you've been tracking the activity for like the near and the war grants, know, like any team that's like building on near and Aurora, they're like receiving like $50,000 grants, right. I mean, I mean, the projects are being built and if you're a developer, right, and you're trying to build, I think all you have to do is like dox yourself to like the near slash Aurora team and then, you know, prove that, hey, like, you know, like this, the project I'm building is not a total piece of crap. And then you can get a grant, right. And, you know, it's been slow, but you know, there's actual development going on and you know, I think that's good, right.
00:13:27.394 - 00:13:42.002, Speaker A: Even though prices don't, and don't get. Don't worry. Right. I'm bag holding with you guys if you're still holding a try or something. But you know, lots of, lots of building going on, right. So many grants and incentives will go to users too at some point in the future. And the team is incredibly strong, right.
00:13:42.002 - 00:14:33.238, Speaker A: If you go to the near side, the CEO, Marie, she was the former CMO of Circle, right? And Ilya, who's like the co founder of Nier, like developed tech, stack him, he's really smart. Or aside Alex Chopchenko, I think, you know, he's a great dev, you know, strong team all around. And the problem with the delays, right? And the reason for the delays is that there are these gas limit issues. If you use money markets like on Aave for avalanche or Gaison Phantom or something, you will notice that every smart contract that you interact with the gas is higher for money market protocols, right? And it's because I guess for these lending smart contracts, it's a little, little bit more complicated. So it takes a, I guess it takes more gas to use and there's back end issues that they're dealing with. And I heard it's going to be resolved in early March or something. So I mean, I don't know.
00:14:33.238 - 00:14:50.768, Speaker A: Right. It's gone delayed so often that there's no way to know. But, you know, it is what it is. And these gas limit issues are preventing money market dafts from launching. And like I mentioned earlier, you know, this violates the humble farmer thesis. If there's no money market with incentives, then like, there's no point using it. So I think for me, for Nier and Aurora, I think I was like way too early.
00:14:50.768 - 00:15:13.396, Speaker A: I still, I'm still like pretty optimistic on that entire ecosystem for this year, right. And I guess we're still like halfway into Q one, right. So it's like not invalidated per se. But, you know, being too early is the same as being wrong. Right. Because if you're too early, right. There's like opportunity cost of capital if you're allocated incorrectly for like one or two months or something.
00:15:13.396 - 00:15:28.824, Speaker A: Right. So, you know, it is what it is. But you know, I'm still optimistic for those that still are interested. And if you look at the weaknesses from other l one s, you know, like near included, you see that, you know, these incentives are needed for user acquisition. Right. Because incentives are essentially like a marketing term. Right.
00:15:28.824 - 00:15:50.530, Speaker A: Marketing tool. Right. Like would you rather like have Eva lab spend $100 million making banner ads on like around New York City, like running tv ads? Or would you rather, you know, give $100 million away to the users? Right. It's definitely more beneficial that way. And I would argue that the avalanche ecosystem is really good. Right. I mainly operate on avalanche.
00:15:50.530 - 00:16:09.142, Speaker A: What was I going to say? Yeah. And I feel like when avalanche rush started, I think all the EtH maxis were like, oh, yeah, like they're going to, all the mercenary farmers they're going to farm and they're going to leave when the incentives are out. But that hasn't been the case. People actually stay. Right. Because avalanche is kind of like EtH L2. Right.
00:16:09.142 - 00:16:32.586, Speaker A: And like I'm not using arbitrament optimism. Like the arbitragement optimism sucks. You know, there's like no activity. RPC's are awful at the current, at the data recording, obviously. So, you know, it actually works. It actually works. And that being said, what are farming strategies that I'm deploying? And one of the things that I've talked about that I think is still, that still has merit is hedging.
00:16:32.586 - 00:17:09.396, Speaker A: Right. And I have some hedges on. I'll show some. And it's not because I'm like, I'm like that bearish, right. I still believe that, like, I think bitcoin is like in this range between like 30 and we're definitely like the lower part of that range. So I'm not like saying that we're going to dump, right. But it's more so the idea of survival and prioritizing, minimizing downside over maximizing upside, I don't really care in the next two months or three months or whatever, if I don't maximize my gains, if the cost of not getting wrecked is, I protect my downside.
00:17:09.396 - 00:17:32.522, Speaker A: And maybe on the upside I don't make as much money, but that's fine, right? Because I'm still bullish. This industry as a whole, in the short term, it's very uncertain. So I'm just gonna have hedges on. So if the markets do dump, you know, at least I'm hedged, right? That's kind of how I'm thinking about things. And I went over this strategy on 7 February using GLP and GM Max. I'm not gonna spend too much time on it because, you know, I made a 20 Minutes video. Check that out.
00:17:32.522 - 00:18:03.234, Speaker A: But I'll go over like, the general sense. And even this strategy has been questionable recently just because the activity on GMX has gone down. And I think someone was exploiting like one of the, it's not like a technical exploit, but, you know, there was like some thing where like, some users were like, able to extract value from GMX and they're like, they're fixing it, right? So for the next two to three days, trading activity is going to be halted. And, you know, that means that there's less fees to be. To go around, right. You can see this in the metrics. Fees have gone down.
00:18:03.234 - 00:18:40.990, Speaker A: And I guess, you know, if the markets are dumping, then there's less incentive for people to speculate on, like, leverage longs. But, you know, I still like GOP because it's like the, the yield is actually coming from, like, fees generated on the platform aside, like, and not from like, farm tokens, right. I'd rather earn like 20% paid in Avax than like 200% paid in like, some random farm tokens that's gonna dump 90% in the next like two weeks. And the hedging strategy that I currently deploy. And you can use, I mean, you don't have to use Joe. You can use like, tricryptor, you can use Trader Joe, you can borrow a vault to asset on Navi and enter a volatility muted form to maximize your sleep adjusted returns. I'm going to meme sleep adjusted returns in 2022.
00:18:40.990 - 00:19:03.174, Speaker A: And, you know, yeah, I mean, tell your friends, right? Like, hey, like, don't, don't be a djen. You got to maximize your sleep adjusted returns. So, you know, this is a screenshot of my Aave position, right. As you can see, I have, let's just look at the ETH aspect, right? So I have 50 eth on the lending side. Right. You know, just generating one 1.4% or whatever.
00:19:03.174 - 00:19:36.514, Speaker A: And on the right side, I'm borrowing 50 e, right. And I'm using the borrowed amount to put into GLP, right. So I'm effectively short ETH because I'm borrowing it and selling it to buy GLP. But, you know, it is what it is. I don't really care, right. And, you know, I could technically sell my ETH, right? But I don't deal with, like, capital gains and, like, the entire tax situation there is so difficult that I'd rather like, you know, not sell my collateral, but borrow the same amount. And GLP is 20% ETH.
00:19:36.514 - 00:20:20.626, Speaker A: So I'm net long term ten etH, if that makes sense, right? Because GLP is an asset, is a basket of assets containing eth, bitcoin, avax, and stable coins. So, you know, if ETH pumps, then I lose money on the hedge, but the rest of my portfolio will pump enough where I'm like, okay, I don't really care if eth dumps, then at least I'm hedged, right? My net worth is still going to plummet. But, you know, it's like, whatever, right. It is what it is. What you can also do if you're more feeling more frisky, right. If you're feeling more bearish and you want to like, you know, like, I guess short hedge more is you can borrow Avax and then enter Avax UST or Avax USDC, right? So, like, take, borrow $10,000 at the Avax, sell half into USDC, be an LLP. If markets go sideways, you make money because you're earning fees.
00:20:20.626 - 00:21:04.756, Speaker A: If markets dump, you make money because you make money on the hedge because you owe less, right? Because the value that you borrow is going to be worth less than, like, the value they have in your farm. If Avax pumps, then you lose money on the hedge, but the rest of your portfolio is probably up more. So who cares at that point, right? Nothing wrong with, like, you know, borrowing a vac, selling the stable coins to farm with, right? That's also like a direct short. Or you can just sell whatever that, whatever, all coins that you're holding and then farm stables, right? It doesn't really matter. But the idea is, I don't know, like, I'm just gonna make sure that I don't, like, get wrecked, right? Because if you scroll around Twitter, there's, like, people that's like, getting blown out because the leverage trading and whatnot. And I'm not a good trader, right? I mean, if you just follow my move. I'm not, like, that good a trader, right.
00:21:04.756 - 00:21:27.462, Speaker A: I think I do an okay job catching trends, but I'm not, like, I'm not good at, like, selling tops or buying bottoms. Right. That's not my. That's not my strength. My strength is kind of doing, like, fundamental analysis and, like, I guess, like, identifying quality projects. And for every loser, there's a winner. And, you know, on average, the winners make up for my losers.
00:21:27.462 - 00:21:39.526, Speaker A: Right. And that's kind of how you make money over time in crypto, right. Like, not everything that you put money in is gonna make money. Right. I mean, I've had many, like, 1% bets that go to. That go to zero, right. But that's fine, right? I risked 1% for that reason.
00:21:39.526 - 00:21:59.592, Speaker A: But the winners hopefully compound over time. And, you know, that's kind of how you make money in crypto. So, you know, like, techie's hedged. Techie doesn't like Defi because it's, you know, it's all scam. It's not really. But, you know, like, what does it actually mean? Fundamentals matter. That's kind of how I want to get across.
00:21:59.592 - 00:22:33.384, Speaker A: So that's kind of the point I want to get across in this video because, you know, like, you, there's, like, so many projects, and, like, most of them are going to go to zero, right. I mean, there's, like, no innovation, right. You just, like, introduce a new token and, like, it's not creating any value, right. Because if a protocol is not, like, generating any value, then it's going to go to zero. Why does it even exist? Right? There's no point of a project existing if it doesn't really do anything. So the goal of crypto is to find a project that actually does something. What a novel concept.
00:22:33.384 - 00:22:53.540, Speaker A: You have to look for revenue, real cash flow. And you can't just look at revenue. You have to also look at inflation. There's a lot of confusion between, like, oh, my God, this protocol is generating a million dollars a week in revenue. It's so good. But that's price to sales, right? You can't look at price to sales ratio. You have to look.
00:22:53.540 - 00:23:36.174, Speaker A: Sorry. You can't. You can't look at, like, the revenue and think of it as, like, earnings, right? Because what if the protocol makes a million dollars a week, but to earn a million dollars a week, they have to offer $2 million worth of farming rewards, right? What if all the revenue is subsidized with the farming rewards? Well, then that project is going to go to zero right, over time. Because if all the revenue is subsidized, then if the token dumps, then revenue is also going to dump because people aren't really going to be using that platform. So you have to look for protocols that can actually have a way to profitability. It's kind of like Uber. Maybe a protocol that's unprofitable at the beginning is fine if they have a row to sustain profitability.
00:23:36.174 - 00:24:03.030, Speaker A: Uber, right? Like four years ago, I was, like, spending like $4, you know, going from, like, going on 15 minutes rides because they were, like, subsidizing everything. But now that, like, they're, like, losing money, you know, like, you can't. They can't really subsidize that much anymore. And now the rides are like $20, right. Maybe that's partly inflation too, but, you know, no, there has to be a path to sustainability, right? Because farming rewards is a way to accumulate. Sorry, not accumulate. Acquire new customers, right? It's a marketing tool.
00:24:03.030 - 00:24:48.058, Speaker A: So, you know, what does this actually mean? Right. You know, because it feels like this is happening, right? And until incentives come in or until, I guess, more capital inflow comes in, for whatever reason, in crypto, you should expect price to go down because, you know, everything in crypto is inflationary, right? So there has to be buy pressure to offset that for prices to even remain stable. Right? And I don't mean to, like, hit on devs, right? There's actually, like, there's innovation happening everywhere, right? But, you know, maybe, like, part of that is going to take some time to play. All right? Because if you think about it, like, all these projects they have, like, it's being worked on by humans, right? Like, I'm a human. I make mistakes. Devs are humans. They make mistakes.
00:24:48.058 - 00:25:19.856, Speaker A: So there's like, that meme of like, hey, like, are the devs doing something? Like, yes, they're doing something. But I think. I think most people in crypto just have, like, unrealistic expectations of, like, a project launches and you're like, yeah, like, make it pump devs. Like, make me money, right? But that's not their goal. I mean, maybe, like, some devs, like, there's in it for the money, right? And they're gonna, like, dump on you and, like, they're gonna leave, and then, because they're anonymous, they're gonna start a new project and then dump on you. And then you'll keep doing that for, like, you know, ten months or something. But, you know, the good actors in this space, they're actually, like, you know, they actually have a vision.
00:25:19.856 - 00:25:33.164, Speaker A: They're working on something, trying to create economic value. And that's kind of what you want to bet on, right? It's kind of. Kind of what? Kind of what you want to bet on, right? And, you know, one thing I. One thing that I noticed is, like. Like, gold. Gold is pumping, man. Like, three weeks in a row.
00:25:33.164 - 00:25:43.852, Speaker A: Like, three. It's pumping, man. It's like. It's still $1900, right? But, you know, look at this uptrend. It's pretty crazy. And maybe Peter Schiff was right. Maybe Peter Schiff was right.
00:25:43.852 - 00:26:10.800, Speaker A: Maybe everything is a scam and we should all be farming gold, right? Whether it's like farming with synthetic gold assets or, you know, we just, like, you know, start going out in Arizona and, like, start digging for gold. Maybe that's what we needed to do. But, you know, then I was, like, doing research on gold farms. And then, you know, today, the gold mine finance hard worked on phantom, right? God damn it. The devs got us again. $800,000 already staked, and likely we'll be lost. Toon fork watch, toon finance.
00:26:10.800 - 00:26:26.426, Speaker A: Oof. You know, maybe. Maybe the gold farms aren't that good. But in all seriousness, there's actually a pretty good gold farm on mirror finance, right? Mirror is on terra. I have videos on this. I'm not gonna spend too much time on this. You know, you can long farm gold.
00:26:26.426 - 00:26:45.402, Speaker A: I mean, 11% is not that good, but I mean, it's gold, right? So long farming. You take, let's say, $1,000 with IAU, $1,000 with the UST. You lP, you farm, earn 11%. And also United States oil fund, right? 19% to Long farm. Look at this. It's up. Oh, my God.
00:26:45.402 - 00:27:09.820, Speaker A: This is up only, right? I mean, this thing went negative in 2020, and now it's at $64. You know, that's an infinity percent roI. Like, that's crazy. Literally infinity percent. It definitely invested in the wrong gas, right? Like, you know, the crypto natives, they told me that ethereum is gas. Ethereum is money, but turns out oil is. Oil is a better inflation and hedge than then eat.
00:27:09.820 - 00:27:42.258, Speaker A: The devs got us again. The devs got us again. But no, in all seriousness, I mean, this doesn't mean crypto defies that. But, you know, it is what it is, right? I mean, I don't want to, like, you know, say, like, oh, my God, we're gonna pump. You know, that's not the point of the video. It's to acknowledge, like, the current phase of the markets and how do we react and how I'm allocated is I'm, you know, I'm, I've always been heavier in the majors. I have bitcoin and eth and stables.
00:27:42.258 - 00:28:22.684, Speaker A: I guess just because, you know, it's, I kind of think them, think of them as like index funds and I can farm with it, you know, use it as collateral. And when the market dumps, they just dump less. And you know, if you can use them as collateral, you can also have these random strategies like hedging all that, right? And then if you're going to be looking for more volatile coins, that's not like ether or something or Avax or whatever. Like not l one. Not l one. S. Now maybe it makes sense to focus on gamefi not because it's guaranteed to go up, but you know, it has, it has a narrative that could definitely play out and it could definitely onboard more users.
00:28:22.684 - 00:28:56.696, Speaker A: So that's kind of how I'm thinking about it, you know, and, you know, like you have to look at the fundamentals in a bull market. Everything goes up, right. You don't, you don't have to do that much research to make money, but in these market conditions, you know, it's really hard, right? Even like I'm doing so much research, but I'm still losing money. Losing money. But the hope is that, you know, the research that I'm doing now will pay off three months from now is hopefully how I'm thinking about it. But it's, nothing is guaranteed, right? And no one knows what's going to happen, right? Maybe I just get rubbed everywhere. There are teams building quality projects.
00:28:56.696 - 00:29:18.752, Speaker A: They have roadmaps to profitability. They have good intentions and a vision. They have clear product market fit. Bet on those, right? I think product market fit is the most important, right. Because you can definitely find projects that like, you know, that are being pumped, right? But there's like no product market fit, right. You know, there has to be product market fit. And you know, lastly, optimize for mental health insanity.
00:29:18.752 - 00:30:18.710, Speaker A: Um, you know, like when you're like managing money, right? Depending on how much money in crypto, how much money you have in crypto, um, you know, you have to optimize for month hold because maybe in the next three months we just pump to 40k, dump to 30k, you know, maybe that's, imagine that scenario, right? And that's, that's going to be awful for your mental health. It's like, it's like, you know, if you go to 40k, it's like, oh, it's going to pump, and then if you go down to, it's going to dump, and then it just keeps doing the same thing over and over again. At the end of the day, you might just, like, be getting like, 4 hours of sleep similar to, like, late 2020, 2021, or like, early 2021. You know, there's gonna be, at some point easy money is gonna come, right. Today is not easy money, right. Today is not easy money, you know, so you want to be ready for your future when the easy money comes. And to do that, you need to not get wrecked in the short term.
00:30:18.710 - 00:30:45.586, Speaker A: And that's kind of how I'm thinking about it. You have to protect the downside and accumulate quality. Like, I'm not really, like, trying to, like, you know, flip, you know, trade bitcoin, like, buy at 33, sell at 36, and then repeat. Like, I'm not really doing that. That's not my edge. And also, I forgot to put this in the slide. But you have to identify your edge, right? Like, if you're like, a buy and hold investor, then, like, your edge comes from, like, patience and maybe, like, finding good farms, right.
00:30:45.586 - 00:31:09.916, Speaker A: If you're like, a trader, then, you know, you can do a combination of farming and then trading and then, like, that's maybe where your offer comes from. And, you know, if you're new to crypto, then, like, maybe you just focus on, like, safe farms first and then expand into, like, random strategies that you think is gonna make you money or something. Yeah. I don't even know how long this video has been. I think this is. Yeah, it's the end of the slide. I mean, this.
00:31:09.916 - 00:31:32.492, Speaker A: This wasn't even, like, a bearish video. Like, I can be way more bearish if you want me to. Right. Let me know. Maybe next week I'll start making, like, super bearish videos. Not because I want to be bearish, but, you know, maybe it's good to, like, just, like, be bearish just so it can help people think about things better. I guess the problem I have with that is that, like, if I'm gonna be bearish something, then I have to give examples of projects.
00:31:32.492 - 00:32:03.192, Speaker A: And I don't really want to bash on projects because, you know, not all projects, like, not all projects that fail have, like, devs with bad intentions. Right. I mean, it's just like a failed experiment, and I don't want to bash on devs if they're trying. Right. But, you know, I can definitely make bearish videos. You know, I try to keep things positive on the channel right. Just because like, like, I don't really gain anything from making bearish videos, right.
00:32:03.192 - 00:32:25.136, Speaker A: I just get people angry at me, like, you know, like send me threats on Twitter or something. So it's like, like, for these public videos, it's like, you know, like, doesn't really, I don't really get anything end up being bearish. But I mean, this was a slightly bearish video with, you know, with optimistic takes to it. So hopefully this kind of helps. But, you know. Yeah. Thank you.
00:32:25.136 - 00:32:54.660, Speaker A: Anyone that came to East Denver had a good time, I had, I got a bunch of these bloater stickers, right? So, so many bloaters. Right? You gotta love the bloaters. Um, make them rain, right? Make them rain. So thank you guys for watching and hopefully you guys are doing okay. I think it's okay. So if you want to like take a break for like, I don't know, like a few months or if you, if you like, go on vacation, right? It's just like, yeah, there's like stable farm, put a hedge on, go on vacation, come back. Maybe, probably the prices will be like the same or something.
00:32:54.660 - 00:33:07.920, Speaker A: So just optimize for your sanity, your mental health, because if you're not thinking clearly, then you're going to make mistakes and you don't want to make mistakes when you're managing money. So thank you guys for watching and have fun farming out there. Bye.
