00:00:00.240 - 00:00:24.570, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. And in this video I'll be talking about many, many things. Timestamps are in the description below. I'll be talking about why I sold some of my quickswap tokens, how I'm essentially printing free money using Aave on Polygon, the new token that I'm looking at called must. And lastly, I'll be looking at some farms that I've been looking at and giving my thoughts on them. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started.
00:00:24.570 - 00:00:46.242, Speaker A: So if you haven't noticed, the price of quick swap has gone absolutely mental in the past couple of days. Look at this chartreck. Absolutely insane. And what I've done is I sold some quick swap. I put $7,000 in the quick swap at roughly $460 $450. I captured three x. So I decided to take a third of my third of my position out.
00:00:46.242 - 00:01:25.982, Speaker A: So I put seven k. Now it's worth 21k. So I put seven k. So now I'm essentially playing with the house's money and with the $7,000, I'm putting it into Aave to do a yield arbitrage. Because if you think about it, I do think Quickswap will continue trending up because it is still undervalued, in my opinion. But I mean, look at this chart, right? Would it really surprise you if it did something like this? No? Right. But even if you think it's going to go up, how would you feel at this point when it's trading at like $900? Right? So I think selling a third after three x, like that kind of portfolio management risk mitigation strategy is a good, like, mental, psychological thing that you can do.
00:01:25.982 - 00:01:57.184, Speaker A: So, you know, you're not like staring at charts all the, all the time. And I feel comfortable swapping a third of my position in the stable coins because Polygon and Aave have a partnership and Polygon is doing a $40 million liquidity mining program with Aave. What does this actually mean? So if you look at the markets, if you don't know, Aave is a borrowing lending platform. It's, I think, the second largest on Ethereum behind Makerdao, and they already have $2 billion locked up in it. Right? So let's look at this column. First, the deposit API. So this is how much you earn on your assets.
00:01:57.184 - 00:02:30.102, Speaker A: If you deposit, if you, if you lend out your assets on AAve, so you get paid out. So if you lend out USDC you get paid 2.6% in USDC, and you also get paid 6% in the matic token. Okay, so what is the borrow APR? So this is how much you have to pay Aave to borrow funds from the network. But the thing is, you get paid to borrow on AAve. So if you're borrowing tether USDT, you have to pay 4% to AavE. But the poly, the partnership, is making it so that they're paying you 16%, paid ematic tokens to you.
00:02:30.102 - 00:02:48.382, Speaker A: So it's your. You can borrow. In other words, you get paid to borrow and lend on AAve. So what I'm doing right now is I talked about my $7,000. I put it in here, and I'm earning 2.6% and 6%, and I'm borrowing tether, which is an APR of 4%. And I also get paid 16% in matic.
00:02:48.382 - 00:03:16.144, Speaker A: So if you look at the top, right, I've. I did this, like, an hour ago, and I'm already earning 0.35 matic, which is not insane. But if you think about it, like, that's going to add up over many, many days, over many, many weeks. And for an asset like Matic, which I think will trend up over time, it's still volatile, right? It's not. I mean, farming matic isn't the same type of dopamine as, like, buying 10,000 matic and, like, seeing it, like, go up 30%, go down 20%, all that. But, you know, why buy.
00:03:16.144 - 00:03:54.340, Speaker A: Why buy a volatile asset when you can just farm it for free? And the thing is, with the tether that I'm borrowing, what am I doing with it? I'm putting it into polywheel, right? This is the thing I'm talking about. So the two thirds of my position, it's still here for quickswap, which is earning me CRO. And the $5,000 of tether is earning me CRO tokens, and the price of CRO has gone mental. Like, I suggest everyone watch this video that I released on the 27th. I talked about Quickswap and Poliwell. At the time of this video, Quickswap is at 600, and Krill was at $70. And so as you can see, there's a lot of money flowing into the polygon network.
00:03:54.340 - 00:04:43.704, Speaker A: The thing is, I've seen some tweets on Twitter about, like, how krill is, like, the next pancake swap, and, like, Krill is the future of finance. But it's not, like, literally, like, the krill token is a Ponzi krill is a fork of Gusag finance, which is another Ponzi on binance smart chain. And look at the price of the token, right? I mean, everyone gets really excited in the first one or two weeks and then it just trends to zero over time. I think that the chart of krill is going to look like this. Four months from now, you'll look back on Krill and like, be like, oh, yeah, it was a literal fork of Krill for Google's finance. Because how do tokenomics work? Is that when you deposit funds to poliw, they take a fee and the fee is used to buy back krill on the market. So the only way that the krill price keeps going up is if more and more people deposit funds into polywell.
00:04:43.704 - 00:05:06.796, Speaker A: Because what am I doing with it? I'm literally dumping krill on the market every single day. That's. And a lot of whales are doing that, too. So that's consistent selling pressure. But the selling pressure is being overridden by the amount of people. That's just literally depositing funds onto polygon because we're still relatively early into the matic ecosystem and the adoption of it. So, no, don't buy into the fact.
00:05:06.796 - 00:05:30.524, Speaker A: Don't buy into the narrative that Krill is going to keep going to $1,000 on something like. No. Like, it might peak at like, 200 and it's going to go down from there. So just a quick warning. So what am I doing with those CRO tokens? So, like I said, I'm literally, literally dumping into the markets, but. And I'm buying the musk token. Okay, so what is the must token? Well, it's a $27 million market cap, a little under 400 million, fully diluted.
00:05:30.524 - 00:06:07.056, Speaker A: And it's. It's like an NFT slash gaming platform. But there, I mean, I'm not investing in this for this reason. I'm investing it in it because they're the second largest decentralized exchange on Matic. So if you think that quick swap has gone up a lot and there's a potential for, like, a catch up trade for the musk token, maybe that's something for you. If you look at the numbers, quickswap has done 250,000 transactions in the past 24 hours, generating less than a million dollars in fees, whereas comet swap this much transactions and generating that much in fees. So obviously it's not going to flip.
00:06:07.056 - 00:06:24.632, Speaker A: Quick swap, obviously. I mean, this is like tiny compared to must is tiny compared to quick. But if you've. I suggest everyone follow him. He's really good. He's a friend of mine. But if you look at a chart from us, he found something interesting where it looks like this.
00:06:24.632 - 00:06:55.910, Speaker A: It pumped a lot, and then it's, like, going sideways. And the chart for quick swap was similar, where it pumped a lot, went sideways, and just pumped really, really hard. So if you're as blush as me on Polygon and you think more and more money will flow into it, maybe this is a nice catch up trade that you can do and. But like I said, like, I'm not spending my own money buying must. I'm buying must with krill that I think is gonna be a worthless governance token. So I'm buying must for free, and I'm gonna continue doing this until a better opportunity pops up. So always mitigate your risk.
00:06:55.910 - 00:07:21.316, Speaker A: Understand that these assets are really, really volatile. They can go to zero. And if you're buying those assets, I would rather do it with, like, things that I'm farming with, if that makes sense. Okay, so what are some farms that I'm watching? This is the last section of the video. This was announced, I think, a day or two ago, or that's when it hit my radar. It's called polygag. If you look at the pools, it's absolutely insane.
00:07:21.316 - 00:07:36.868, Speaker A: Like, what are these aprs? Like, what the fuck is this? Like, this is not real. Yeah. So this is gonna go down. Like. And they're not audited, by the way, audits don't really mean much. Polywell is audited here, audited by hacking. But there's a site called rect news.
00:07:36.868 - 00:08:04.538, Speaker A: And if you look at the leaderboards, it takes a look at the biggest rugs, the biggest hacks and whatnot. And the fourth largest was with Alpha Finance in February 2021. And they were actually audited by two firms. So just because something is audited doesn't mean that it's completely safe, but it definitely helps, right? I would rather put my money into polywheel because it's audited than something called a polygatch. Another thing about polygatch is that the founder, the lead developer of Polygag, is this guy. It's Gajesh. And he's literally a 13 year old.
00:08:04.538 - 00:08:41.272, Speaker A: Like, what the fuck, right? Would I feel comfortable putting some of my net worth into the hands of a 13 year old? I don't know about that, but I can't really talk shit. Cause he has more subscribers than me, and he has more followers than me, and it seems like he's been making crypto videos for many, many years. So maybe he is legit. So always do your own research. But Polygad could be something to look forward to. And, you know, also it doesn't really scream professional when the protocol is tweeting things like fun fact, gadget means elephant, right? Doesn't really scream professional to me. Lastly, I'll be looking at Polyfox.
00:08:41.272 - 00:09:13.980, Speaker A: They're launching in a day, in 14 hours, similar to Polygadget. APIs are absolutely insane to. So always do your own research. They're not audited yet. The developer is anonymous, so you can't really audit who the guy is. But I think it's interesting because they actually have a krill farm with deposit be 4%. So if you're feeling spicy, maybe you just farm krill on polywheel and which is like you're earning that for free, right? And you can take those, the free krill that you're earning and put it into polyfox just in case it turns out to be legit.
00:09:13.980 - 00:09:49.432, Speaker A: Obviously there's lots of risk that here, like even polywhale could rug. I trust polyrail more than these other two. But like I said, if polygamy and Polyfox tend to be legit, more and more money will flow into them, which means there will be less buying pressure for the cruel token, which will go down. So always understand how tokenomics work. These tokens are not like the future of finance. It's going to go down and understand that, you know, these rates will also go down as well. The reason it's so high right now is because there's not that much funds on Polygon right now.
00:09:49.432 - 00:10:31.360, Speaker A: It's literally a $40 million liquidity mining program that's going to go on until April 13 of 2022. So what if the TVL on Aave goes up ten x? Well, these rates would go down by a factor of ten or something along those lines. So understand that you are early in this. So these opportunities do existential, but if more and more people understand and like, learn about this, it's these yields will go down. So with that being said, if you like the content, please like and subscribe and let me know if you have any questions. It really helps if you like the video because, yeah, I think I'm really, really early into the Polygon network and it helps if I can have some positive reinforcement from you guys and to also help with the YouTube algorithms. Thank you guys for watching and have a nice day.
