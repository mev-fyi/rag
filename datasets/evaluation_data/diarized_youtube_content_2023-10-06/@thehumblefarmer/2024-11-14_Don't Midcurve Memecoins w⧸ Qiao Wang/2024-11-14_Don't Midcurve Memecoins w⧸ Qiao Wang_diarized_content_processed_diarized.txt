00:00:00.360 - 00:00:06.085, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Taiki here and welcome to the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I'm joined by Chao. How are you doing today? Are you enjoying the pumps?
00:00:06.825 - 00:00:08.565, Speaker B: I am respecting the pump.
00:00:08.945 - 00:00:24.205, Speaker A: Respect the pump. I mean, as we speak, Bitcoin's chatting at 92. I mean, honestly, we might get to 100k this week, right? Where do you think we are in the cycle? It feels so euphoric. But where do you think we are?
00:00:24.745 - 00:00:34.875, Speaker B: This doesn't feel like the final. Like, I think there's probably at least one more. You know, earlier this week, my quote unquote friends who haven't talked to me for two years, they text me about bitcoin.
00:00:35.035 - 00:00:36.535, Speaker A: Yeah, me too.
00:00:36.955 - 00:01:03.835, Speaker B: So I think they're just getting started. I think a site like this current rally from the previous all time high to where it is today, like 90, maybe we end up at 100, maybe 110, I don't know. But this leg up, it doesn't feel like the final one. There's probably one more after this. Like we, we have this rally and then we take a break. Then one final rally. That's my, my hunch.
00:01:04.335 - 00:01:34.445, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the, you know, we often talk about the normie signal, right? It's like, oh, our friends start texting us. It's. It's top signal. But the thing is, I mean, every cycle we gain more people or, you know, we get more adoption people. The thing is like, are all our friends buy bitcoin or eth, right? Or they hold a little bit and they don't like think about it, they forget about it. And now that it's pumping, they pay more attention to it and then the question is like, what are they going to buy next? And I think, you know, the thesis with Murad and Ansem is that, you know, we're entering like a meme coin super cycle.
00:01:34.445 - 00:02:15.459, Speaker A: But no, before I talk about meme coins, I do want to pull up this, this image. So I had you on like earlier this year, I think, and there's like this belker of meme, right? First cycle, you're a left curve, you don't give a fuck. You just take on all the risk and you just make a bunch of money. But at some point you lose second cycler, ptsd, mid curve syndrome. Then third cycler, you just embrace everything just by means. So recently I've fully embraced meme coins. But how does one manage their portfolio at this point? What's the optimal portfolio strategy? Is it a barbell of majors and memes? Like, how do you like, how are you currently positioned?
00:02:15.547 - 00:03:05.705, Speaker B: You know, I don't know. Like, the ideal portfolio obviously depends on your personal circumstances, but I can tell you how I'm positioned. Yeah, My core holdings has been Bitcoin, Sol and Coin, Coinbase for a very long time, basically throughout since the beginning of the cycle. So that's my core portfolio. And then I have a side pocket of for. For trading, like smaller size and more frequent positions in and out. So in that portfolio I have, I currently have goat popcat with Doge and that's pretty much, that's pretty much the meme coins.
00:03:05.705 - 00:03:49.291, Speaker B: And then I have like radium and arel just in case. Radium is the defi exposure for Solana and arrow is the defi exposure for Base. I actually tweeted about this yesterday. I'm like, yeah, when you see smart people shill coins that you don't own, but you don't own and you don't have full conviction on, but they have a good bull case, it's not necessarily a bad idea to buy a little because that's basically a hedge for your mental health. Because if you don't own any and those coins go up, your mind will be messed up. This is what I learned in the last few cycles. I'm implementing this in my side pocket.
00:03:49.483 - 00:04:20.533, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're in the ape first research later phase. And me personally, I only own AI meme coins right now. Actually, this morning I saw the Paul Grewal tweet know coinbase finally starting to list more memes. I saw this and I just like, top blasted Pepe, you know, you know what? Like fuck it, you know? Yeah, the feeling I get. I suggest everyone try this. Just sell a little bit of your eth to buy a meme point. You'll feel so much better.
00:04:20.533 - 00:04:36.699, Speaker A: Like, I don't know what it is about it. You, like, just get rid of this mental baggage. You get like post nut clarity. It's like, wow, like I could do this, you know, Like, I feel like there's this social norm to just hold on to your eth or just any coin in general. But you don't have to, right? I mean, you can do whatever the.
00:04:36.707 - 00:05:00.685, Speaker B: Fuck you want because you know deep down it's not the right asset to own, at least at this stage of the cycle. There's two cases. One case is you sell and you regret immediately. The other case is you sell and you feel much better. So the lesson is you should, when in doubt, just sell a little bit and buy something else and see how you feel? Yeah, because that's what your subconscious is going to tell you.
00:05:01.225 - 00:05:10.713, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean, you know, if you sell 10% of your eat and you're and eat pumps to Valhalla, like, you're still fine, right? Yeah, but I think the reality is.
00:05:10.849 - 00:05:25.783, Speaker B: Obviously at this stage of the, I mean, like, I'm not like talking shit about youth right now specifically, but at this stage of the, of the cycle, like if the goal is to maximize P and L, then you don't want to own the majors.
00:05:25.919 - 00:05:45.759, Speaker A: Like, for me, like, I just have this barbell approach of just like, you know, majors and memes because, like majors will benefit from like this PVE environment. Right. A rising tide lifts all boats and you know, I can go to sleep. Right. Sleep adjuster returns and maximize that. But then the convexity comes from memes and I. You've been pretty vocal about Solana versus Eid and you know, wanting to own Solana over eat.
00:05:45.759 - 00:05:55.531, Speaker A: And then this tweet. I think you tweeted this this morning. Everyone's obsessed with the solid flipping. No one's prepared for a Doge eat flipping. So can you expand on this? Do you actually believe in this or we just ship posting.
00:05:55.603 - 00:06:12.136, Speaker B: That was a ship posting. But I like there, it's, it's not there. There's a non significant chance. There's a significant chance that those will be durably number two. Like, like the probability of that is not zero. It's like, like 20, 30%.
00:06:12.245 - 00:06:14.627, Speaker A: 20, 30. That's pretty high. That's pretty high.
00:06:14.691 - 00:06:15.987, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty high.
00:06:16.171 - 00:06:37.305, Speaker A: Yeah. I actually did a podcast with Daryl like from Darryl Wing from Tangent, and he said that there's a chance that bitcoin's at 150 and eth is like at 4k and salon is like at 300. And I'm like, actually, I don't actually disagree. There's a non zero chance. I mean, this podcast is not meant to bash on Ethereum, of course. Right. That's not really the point.
00:06:37.425 - 00:06:46.215, Speaker B: But the thing with DOGE in the coming four years is it's going to be on the headline like every week.
00:06:47.035 - 00:06:47.563, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:47.659 - 00:07:03.575, Speaker B: Like you have Elon and Vivek leading this, you know, new thing to reduce the size of the government. And the lesson that we've learned as a civilization, the lesson that we learned over the last two decades, is to never bet against Elon.
00:07:03.875 - 00:07:04.379, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:04.467 - 00:07:09.655, Speaker B: And so this thing is going to be just on top of everyone's mind share for the next few years.
00:07:10.325 - 00:07:11.105, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:13.165 - 00:07:13.949, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:14.117 - 00:07:18.605, Speaker A: So you do own Doge, you think, you know, so you think it's gonna hit over a dollar, right? That's.
00:07:18.645 - 00:07:38.315, Speaker B: Oh, a dollar for sure. I. I own those. Yeah, A dollar for sure. But the question is like, the, the question, the actual question is whether or not it's gonna flip eth. Like, it's already a third of, like, those is already like, more than halfway towards flipping Soul.
00:07:39.095 - 00:07:39.835, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:40.215 - 00:07:45.955, Speaker B: And Soul is a third of Eve. Like, the difference. The gap between Doge and Eve is not that large.
00:07:46.695 - 00:08:05.603, Speaker A: Right, Right. I feel like if someone's like an ETH maxi and they're listening to this, like, they're going to feel so much anger. How are these guys saying this? But it's just, you know, you have to. It's like the stages of grief. Right. Or acceptance. Like, you just have to accept it at some point that maybe ETH is kind of cucked.
00:08:05.603 - 00:08:13.867, Speaker A: Why do you think people have. Why do you think people have such a hard time accepting that ETH is cucked? You know, there's such emotional baggage there. Right?
00:08:13.971 - 00:08:20.895, Speaker B: Yeah, Emotional baggage. Inability to take on, you know, take new information into account.
00:08:23.515 - 00:08:43.265, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And I think you had this tweet, which I'll pull up real quick. The existential problem with ETH is that there's too many cooks in the kitchen. And maybe you're referring to this. They had like this presentation at devcon, the beam chain, and they're like, okay, we're going to work on this and we're going to ship 2029. It's like, what?
00:08:43.885 - 00:09:08.005, Speaker B: Yeah, I was referring to this, but not specifically this per se. Because when I realized after this talk, people were talking about this, and then there was a bunch of talking heads, like some of the key men in the. At the Ethereum foundation debating each other on this stuff. It's like there's no leader.
00:09:08.825 - 00:09:09.521, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:09.673 - 00:09:35.615, Speaker B: Like, Vitaly is supposed to be the leader. But like, it seems like there's at least two or three key decision makers and there's no consensus among them. And ultimately that's probably the reason why ETH is moving so slow over the last few years. Like, every ETA that the ETH foundation gives out just automatically multiply by three. That will give you the actual ETA.
00:09:35.915 - 00:09:38.821, Speaker A: Okay, so beam chain coming 2039.
00:09:39.016 - 00:09:39.891, Speaker B: 2039.
00:09:39.923 - 00:09:48.787, Speaker A: Yeah, 2039. Okay. And then the roll up centric roadmap, it'll finally come into effect. Yeah.
00:09:48.851 - 00:10:37.585, Speaker B: And I guess someone asked a good question this morning. What mode does ETH still have? You know, a year ago said ETH had some regulatory mode because it has an etf. It had an etf. It. It crossed the regulatory chasm in terms of like how SEC perceives or the current sec. The pre Trump SEC perceives the various crypto assets they deem Seoul, for example, as a security, but ETH is not so. ETH as an asset did have some regulatory mode, but now with this new administration, I don't think that mode exists anymore.
00:10:38.245 - 00:10:43.869, Speaker A: Yeah. What odds would you give the Solana ETF coming in 2025?
00:10:44.037 - 00:10:49.225, Speaker B: I don't have a informed view, but gun to my head, I would say over 50%.
00:10:50.065 - 00:10:56.641, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. There could be a Doge ETF as well, right? Like all these Dino tokens just might get ETFs.
00:10:56.753 - 00:11:07.685, Speaker B: Yeah, we might get a bunch of ETFs or maybe even an index ETF on like top 10 crypto assets or something. Which. Is Cardano still part of it?
00:11:08.945 - 00:11:36.801, Speaker A: I mean, probably Cardano was up like 40% a couple of days ago. And I think now this Pepe listing by Coinbase is kind of like a big shot, like heard around the world. Maybe Binance starting to list memes as well. I think Coinbase is years behind Binance when it comes to just listing their listing criteria being more lenient. And this will pump Pepe. This will probably pump the mid cap memes like 1 to 5 billion. That's going to create a wealth effect.
00:11:36.801 - 00:11:45.387, Speaker A: That wealth effect will go through the trenches. Do you believe in the meme coin super cycle? How big do you think these memes can get? You think Doge can hit over 100 billion then?
00:11:45.481 - 00:11:48.127, Speaker B: I mean, didn't doge 100 billion last cycle?
00:11:48.271 - 00:11:51.271, Speaker A: Let me just double check it hit like 90.
00:11:51.463 - 00:11:54.875, Speaker B: Yeah. So I wouldn't be surprised if it hits 100 this time.
00:11:56.895 - 00:12:07.031, Speaker A: That's definitely the target. And I guess If Doge is 100, 200 build, and the floor, the ceiling of all these memes just go significantly up. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:12:07.103 - 00:12:17.675, Speaker B: I noticed how like those. The. The Doge pump also LED bonk and whiff to pump.
00:12:18.135 - 00:12:22.367, Speaker A: Yeah, it's dog coins, animal coins.
00:12:22.511 - 00:12:24.911, Speaker B: Yeah. But the cat coins are not pumping.
00:12:25.103 - 00:12:30.887, Speaker A: The cat coins, your podcast, not pumping. But it's popping. It's popping. It's popping.
00:12:30.911 - 00:12:32.155, Speaker B: For sure, it's popping.
00:12:35.095 - 00:12:57.467, Speaker A: And I just love this because the thing is, I used to fight this, right? I was like this defi guy. I'm just analyzing cash flow fundamentals and stuff. I was the intelligent investor. At least I told myself that. And then everyone's been talking about, oh, wow, this is going to pump the utility coins. Meme coins are going to underperform and then just everything just goes up 2, 3x. I guess this is what the people want.
00:12:57.467 - 00:12:59.815, Speaker A: You have to kind of accept it for what it is.
00:13:00.795 - 00:13:33.385, Speaker B: My thesis for this stage of the cycle is very simple. You want to own coins that have the following characteristics. One is it's listed on Binance or at least some of the other tier one exchanges. Very low unit price and it has a story that the average person can relate to, can understand. Right. And what that basically means is the meme coins, the meme coin blue chips that are low priced, I mean they're all pretty low priced.
00:13:33.505 - 00:13:44.625, Speaker A: Yeah. And then I think today Robinhood listed Solana back. They, they delisted Salon at the bottom and now they're relisting at 200. I think Pepe and XRP Cardano as well.
00:13:45.125 - 00:13:58.305, Speaker B: And that ties back to, to the SEC problem that I mentioned earlier because a year ago SEC deemed Sol as a security and that was why many exchanges delisted Sol.
00:13:59.885 - 00:14:20.179, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. So, you know, I think we've talked about our market views for the first 15 minutes. I do want to pivot the conversation to more psychology because this is something that I personally struggle with. So I'll just tell, tell you like my story and then you can kind of give me advice because I think a lot of people feel the same way. But for me, I entered the markets in 2020. Like I saw DFI Summer.
00:14:20.179 - 00:14:55.715, Speaker A: It was like, you know, just yoloed in, right? Fully in and then, you know, rewrote or I rode the bull cycle up, wrote it down. It was painful. Um, but for me, this is like the first time where I experienced the brutal bear market. And now we're entering right, like the fabled Golden Bull Run. And I feel like the people, like if you're a new retail participant, you're going to come into the markets feeling super optimistic. This is the beginning of the bull, you know, time to buy fucking crypto coins and make life changing money. But for me, I'm like, wow, I've been experiencing this for so long, I feel like I need to take some profits here.
00:14:55.715 - 00:15:01.963, Speaker A: You know, I need to de risk here a little bit. So as like a three, are you like a three cycler or fourth cycler? Right?
00:15:02.059 - 00:15:02.923, Speaker B: Fourth, yeah.
00:15:03.019 - 00:15:15.491, Speaker A: Fourth cycler. So how do you manage your emotions? How do you shed the ptsd? How do you embrace that this is a bull market and you know, just, can you just give us, give me, I guess, like general advice for how to like manage my emotions.
00:15:15.683 - 00:15:17.695, Speaker B: Do you feel the Market is euphoric.
00:15:18.155 - 00:15:22.727, Speaker A: Yes, but only for meme coiners and I guess bitcoiners.
00:15:22.831 - 00:15:23.439, Speaker B: Okay.
00:15:23.567 - 00:15:24.831, Speaker A: Not freeholders.
00:15:25.023 - 00:16:09.995, Speaker B: Okay. I feel like the market is before it, but it's only maybe a 7 out of 10. And I don't know what, what top signal to look for this cycle, but you can, you can sort of feel the general public sentiment towards crypto in general. Like when you talk to your friends just anecdotally how they feel and you can look at the headlines and you can look at like, I don't know, maybe Coinbase is ranking in app stores, stuff like that. Like some of the old top signals probably still work this time. But I can tell you how I feel. Historically, I've been very good at picking the bottom, but I'm very bad at selling the top and I'm perfectly aware of that.
00:16:09.995 - 00:16:24.015, Speaker B: So what I'm going to do is just when the market reaches maybe a 9 out of 10, I'm going to start DCA out of the market. That's the only thing I can do. But today I'm holding. Today is the same out of 10.
00:16:24.595 - 00:16:32.451, Speaker A: So obviously the seven out of 10, nine out of 10. I mean, it's all subjective, right? Like how do you do you just like scroll Twitter and you know, like how do you gauge the.
00:16:32.523 - 00:17:17.481, Speaker B: I think you want to, I think you want to look at a variety of sources. Twitter is a small bubble, it's a big bubble, but it's still not the representative of the entire market. Like some of the data points that I mentioned earlier, Coinbase's app store ranking, Yahoo Finance. I look at Yahoo Finance every day to see what the normies think about markets and crypto and just talking to your friends, like your normie friends and see how they feel. Right. And also pay attention to your own emotion. Like maybe like how, how you feel this, this cycle compared to last cycle, for example.
00:17:17.481 - 00:17:23.365, Speaker B: Like are you actually at the same level of euphoria where you were at the top of last cycle?
00:17:23.825 - 00:17:54.341, Speaker A: Definitely not. Like last cycle I was so euphoric because. But I was also like a left curve first cycler. All the risk taking, you know, this time around I have to. Yeah, I guess it's all about self awareness, remembering, you know, remembering to dream big because that's how, you know, we make money. But I guess comparing my emotions to, I guess like February 2021, I mean, I'm nowhere near euphoric, you know, so maybe it is like a 7 out of 10. Maybe you are right.
00:17:54.341 - 00:18:04.283, Speaker A: You know what would be like a, like what would you need to see for it to be like a 9 out of 10? Like 10 out of 10? Like what, what are some examples of like things that you know, be like oh my God, like I have to get the fuck out.
00:18:04.419 - 00:18:30.423, Speaker B: I mean it's everything that I, that I just said. But like again like every cycle is, has some similarity but also some differences. Like this cycle is. Every cycle gets a bit crazier than the last time. Like for example, like last cycle if you saw the President elect naming Elon as the head of Doge, like that would have been the top of the cycle. But today, you know, it's not the top cycle. It's probably not the toughest cycle.
00:18:30.423 - 00:18:33.039, Speaker B: I hope it's not. But so there's going to be something.
00:18:33.087 - 00:18:36.635, Speaker A: Crazier and we can't even think about what would be next. Right.
00:18:37.495 - 00:18:58.093, Speaker B: The thing with the super cycle thesis is over the very long time horizon, the chart will look like a super cycle. But the market is always going to be slightly cyclical in the short term there's always going to be euphoria and, and fear. If you zoom into the chart and.
00:18:58.109 - 00:19:13.181, Speaker A: You mentioned you're going to start taking profits out, dcing out what is your profit. Is it just straight to cash and just stablecoin farm or are you going to fully just withdraw to your bank account? What's the best way to not round trip if you're an average retail.
00:19:13.293 - 00:19:18.989, Speaker B: I don't know personally. I just withdraw to my bank account and put it in the boomer stocks.
00:19:19.157 - 00:19:25.955, Speaker A: Put it in boomer stocks? Yeah, I guess so Wait, do you denominate in the S P or do you denominate like stables or Bitcoin or.
00:19:25.995 - 00:19:44.155, Speaker B: Like oh, I denominate USD. I'm so consumer. I've never held, I've never like crypto has never been like less than 50% of my position anyway. Like no matter how ITCA out, it's always going to be a huge, like I always have something a big position on chain.
00:19:44.315 - 00:20:05.737, Speaker A: Yeah, but I guess the point is, you know, no matter how big or how much you make or how much you lose, you want your portfolio to have like higher highs and higher lows. Because it's impossible. That's all the top. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's pretty crazy stuff. Hey, Taiki here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe.

One thing I wanted to pivot the conversation to is something that I'm really interested in is like the AI meme coins. So you know, I, when I saw Good for the first time, that was the moment for me where I just finally capitulated on my mid curve bags and just fully embraced the meme coins. Like something about goats just activated a part of my brain that was like, that's been dormant for so long and I'm like, wow, why am I holding defi bags? You know, like time to buy the memes. This is what the people want. So what do you think about the AI meme coin meta? I think the collective AI meme coins, roughly 2 billion.
00:20:45.563 - 00:21:50.137, Speaker B: It's not just you. Like, there's a ton of founders that I work with, crypto founders that were very jaded towards the meme coins. And there was a bunch of super highbrow Silicon Valley type of people who hated crypto. The moment they saw Truth Terminal, like something activated, like some activated part of their brain and they went all in on crypto, it was actually because of AI, but really they went all in on crypto and meme coins. Even the Mark Andreessen, his brain got activated as well. He was talking about how gold was the very first instance in the history of actually interesting intersection between AI and crypto. Yeah, look, I don't know how, how high the market cap will go because ultimately it's going to depend on, on Binance listing.
00:21:50.137 - 00:22:18.467, Speaker B: Unfortunately, Binance listed act the other day. I don't understand it. I don't understand why they, they didn't list Goat because Goat had by far the largest trading volume out of all the AI Mint points. I would have guessed that the centralized exchanges would want to list something liquid, but they ended up listing 30 million market cap. And this happened 15. How much? 15.
00:22:18.531 - 00:22:19.835, Speaker A: It was 15 before the listing.
00:22:19.875 - 00:22:35.965, Speaker B: Yeah. And this happened quite a few times already. Before it was Nero. Right. So it's entirely possible that Binance has changed their strategy. Listing strategy. And I can steal man the strategy.
00:22:35.965 - 00:23:13.353, Speaker B: Right. Like their strategy is like basically instead of listing very high FTV coins, any coins, both VC coins and meme coins, they want to list the 10, 20, 30 market cap coins in such a way that their users, once they buy those coins, once they're listed, they will make money. Because if the market cap is low, then the path of least resistance is up. So they want their users to make money. So at the end of the day, the AI Memory depends on Binance listing.
00:23:13.489 - 00:23:47.525, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's all about the distribution, the retail distribution and I think it's going to happen. I think, you know, the amount of, the amount of fucks they. Sorry, the amount of fucks Coinbase gives. Maybe like three months ago it was like at a nine. Right. They give a lot of fucks and now it's like going to like a 7, 6, 5 and then they're going to start listing more and more memes as we see with Pepe. And you know, I had you on Steady Lads a couple months ago and I think you said that the positive externality of Pump Fund is that centralized exchanges are going to start taking meme coins seriously and high FTV alts are going to slowly die.
00:23:47.525 - 00:23:50.561, Speaker A: Do you think that's kind of panned out? I think it feels like it is.
00:23:50.593 - 00:24:02.445, Speaker B: Right, Definitely pan out because like, what was the last, like over the last six months, the only VC coin I can think of that got listed on Binance was like Eigen layer.
00:24:04.225 - 00:24:08.273, Speaker A: I think eigen layer layer 0 and scroll and scrolls down only like everything is.
00:24:08.449 - 00:24:10.085, Speaker B: When did scroll get listed?
00:24:11.475 - 00:24:15.291, Speaker A: It was, I think it was last month. Okay, double check.
00:24:15.363 - 00:24:43.555, Speaker B: Yeah, so, yeah, so last time when I went on Steady Lads, I said the last coin, the last VC coin that was listed was layer zero, that was like May or something. And then since then there's has. There has been only two more VC coins and everything else was meme coins. And I think this is, this is obviously a positive externality because if you build a product and it has no users, no traction, you shouldn't deserve a $10 billion valuation.
00:24:47.615 - 00:25:22.755, Speaker A: One problem that Binance or any exchange had when it comes to listing high FTV coins is that if they go down and people buy it, then they lose money and Binance makes less money. They need their users to make money so that they keep trading, they keep swapping, et cetera. And by listing, you know, quote unquote organic meme coins, as they say, you know, it creates a wall effect for the trenches, which will eventually tie lead to more volumes and more fees for them. So the incentives are aligned. Right. Coinbase will probably list more base assets. Right.
00:25:22.755 - 00:25:51.131, Speaker A: To entice developers activity, Binance will keep listing memes. So we kind of have this player vs environment PvE situation for memes and I'm trying to identify the memes, you know, like I'm still a mid curve at heart, so it's hard for me to just ape a dot coin, but I think I just have to buy I think I need at least 1/coin, because if I don't own a dot coin and it pumps, I'm going to be coping. I need to hedge for my mental health. That's what I'm realizing. Yeah, this ape first, research later.
00:25:51.283 - 00:25:53.215, Speaker B: I think the easiest is just Doge.
00:25:53.755 - 00:25:54.323, Speaker A: Doge.
00:25:54.419 - 00:26:01.475, Speaker B: I tweeted about this, but I now think Doge is the. Is the official meme coin for the US Government.
00:26:04.215 - 00:26:11.055, Speaker A: That's so true. I mean, I saw that. I saw the Trump, that PDF thing, and it says Elon and Vivek is going to lead the Doge.
00:26:11.135 - 00:26:14.247, Speaker B: I'm like, this is so what timeline is this?
00:26:14.431 - 00:26:28.899, Speaker A: I know it feels like a simulation, but I guess the most. I mean, Elon said this, right? Like, the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. And now Elon is just like, euphoria posting. Tesla added hundreds of like, whatever. Like lots of billions of market cap. Doge pumping.
00:26:28.947 - 00:26:29.171, Speaker B: He's.
00:26:29.203 - 00:26:37.083, Speaker A: He's on top of the world. Yeah, actually, yeah. It is the meme coin of the US Government that has to have a big tent. Like, that's huge.
00:26:37.259 - 00:26:39.475, Speaker B: Yeah, the TAM is. Is big.
00:26:39.635 - 00:26:47.495, Speaker A: The TAM is big. So. So you think Doge eat flipping? Like, the odds are like, what, 20, like, 25%.
00:26:49.915 - 00:26:56.155, Speaker B: Over the next four years. Well, actually, let me try to be more rigorous about this.
00:26:57.575 - 00:26:58.903, Speaker A: We're doing this in real time.
00:26:58.999 - 00:27:16.235, Speaker B: Yeah. 400 ETH is 400 billion and DOGE is 60. I mean, they're only off by a factor of six times. That can happen pretty quickly. So I would say maybe 20% over the next four years.
00:27:17.905 - 00:27:20.665, Speaker A: Well, Doge.
00:27:20.705 - 00:27:42.325, Speaker B: Solana probably, like, at this point, Doge is 60 and salon is 100. I mean, like, the flipping can happen by the end of the year. Like, I'm not. I'm not predicting it, but I wouldn't be surprised if those flips Solana by the end of the year. Like, Doge went up like 100 times. 100 over the last week. Another 100 is Solana flipping.
00:27:43.975 - 00:27:56.135, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness. I think you're right. I think, I think. Wait, I'm trying to think. I'm trying to think if Doge is mid curve or a left curve. It has to be left curve.
00:27:56.135 - 00:28:04.395, Speaker A: It's left curve and right curve right at this valuation. Or maybe it's all curves. Right. Doge is the most.
00:28:05.935 - 00:28:08.035, Speaker B: This is the meme. Doge is all curves.
00:28:08.415 - 00:28:22.153, Speaker A: Doge is all curves. Oh, my God. Wait, wait, wait. I think I'm being Doge pilled in real time. Doge for. Yeah, a Dollar has to. Like, a dollar is free, right? It feels like a dollar is.
00:28:22.289 - 00:28:22.965, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:23.825 - 00:28:39.221, Speaker A: This podcast is such top signals. My goodness. But this is how we had to think, you know? Yeah, I'm like this. I was like this rigorous defi analyst, and now I'm just. I'm just looking at dog money.
00:28:39.253 - 00:28:53.945, Speaker B: You know what? I realized the cycle, the longer you spend trading meme coins, the better you actually get trading the majors and even trading tradfi. Because then you real. Like, once you're in the trenches enough, you realize everything is a meme.
00:28:54.645 - 00:28:55.029, Speaker A: Right?
00:28:55.077 - 00:29:12.525, Speaker B: Bitcoin is a meme. Eth is a meme. Soul is a meme. They're just different memes of different people, and they're driven by different factors. Yeah, they're all memes. At the end of the day, I traded majors really well this cycle. I just fully unleash my inner.
00:29:14.305 - 00:29:20.937, Speaker A: You just unleashed it. You're going forward. Yeah. Everything is a meme, right? I mean, eth is a meme.
00:29:21.001 - 00:29:21.457, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:21.561 - 00:29:40.809, Speaker A: Everything literally is a meme coin. Actually, I'm going to have Murad on this channel. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow. I literally listened to the Murad, like, token 2049 talk. I'm not even exaggerating, like, 15 times. Like, I'm not even, like, I actually did it, like, 15 times just to drill into my brain. Like, everything's a meme coin, Ty.
00:29:40.809 - 00:30:01.249, Speaker A: Just bring out your inner. Because last cycle, I was in the trenches. Like, I was just on chain, just going crazy. And then after the bear market, I'm like, okay, like, this fundament, like, you know, buy and hold defi coin. And now I'm back to the trenches. And once you get a taste of the solana trenches, you can never go back. That's what I realized.
00:30:01.249 - 00:30:21.713, Speaker A: Once you get a taste of it, it's over. It's over. And then you start to sell your eat for meme coins. It feels so good, right? And this is the eventuality. I think it's inevitable. And I realized that previously I was optimizing for the market that I wanted to see. But that's stupid, right? The market is the market.
00:30:21.713 - 00:30:43.983, Speaker A: The market's not wrong. The market wants meme coins. You just have to embrace it. Yeah. So you mentioned that you're going to take profits into cash and whatnot, but I think market talk, right? I mean, we're kind of just euphoria, just talking about how you work people and whatnot, but obviously, right. There's. I think, for cyclers are starting to come into the picture.
00:30:43.983 - 00:31:10.115, Speaker A: Right. Maybe they're going to discover this channel, I guess. Do you have any advice for someone that has, let's say a mid five figure portfolio that wants to run it up starting from now? Like what typical advice do you have to, you know, make sure that, you know, they capture upside but also don't get destroyed to the downside for Cyclore or just like anyone that's trying to like really lock in right now for the next six to 12 months.
00:31:12.055 - 00:31:17.035, Speaker B: I mean what circle do you want to do? You want to turn like mid five figures into seven, eight?
00:31:17.815 - 00:31:22.665, Speaker A: Let's say, let's, let's say 50k to a million. Just I feel like that's like the typical path.
00:31:22.705 - 00:32:21.745, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, look, I've never done this myself. I've never been in the trenches and turned 50 into a million like with, with, with a fit starting portfolio. But I'm, I'm guessing it's entirely possible to be fully locked in and then just be on deck screener all day and then just initially probably spend a little bit of money. Don't like spend the entire 50k. Like maybe spend like 5% of it just trading, Just follow people on Twitter, follow the high signal people on Twitter and see what they trade, how they trade and after maybe a few months you'll develop really good intuition for what kind of coins will fly. And then I would not be surprised that you can turn 50k to a million purely on like pump fun meme coins.
00:32:22.765 - 00:32:59.465, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely feels like the Salana Trenches are like that. That's where the alpha and the edge is. Of course, I mean you can get destroyed, you know, you can totally get destroyed. But I like my strategy. I mean we're recording this November 13th, but like my current strategy is like video majority of my portfolio in the majors just manifest the PvE, just you know, it'll go up over time and then let's say 20 to 30% is you know, liquid more trade, like more tradable assets. And you know, right now super locked into AI memes. I just think that the current market cap of AI memes like 2 to 3 billion collectively, I think it's only going to go up from here.
00:32:59.465 - 00:33:19.965, Speaker A: I also, I'm looking for like, you know, like animal coins and whatnot. But I just think that if you're trying to make it, it's the salon of trenches. I think you have to manage your risk. You have to know what you're doing. You're going to get destroyed, but you have to get destroyed so you can Internalize the lessons of the trenches. It is. Most people do lose money.
00:33:19.965 - 00:33:33.705, Speaker A: I have the strategy of just holding coins, just believing in it. Just stop trading, believe in something. Look, I'm a disciple of Murad at this point. I can't wait to talk to him.
00:33:36.245 - 00:34:04.521, Speaker B: But Marat strategy, Marat is about holding meme coins for a long period of time. I don't think from this stage of the cycle it's possible to pull a 20x, like maybe 5x. Like the coins that the morale is like popcat. Can popcat go up 20x? I really doubt it. But 5x I think is possible. So if you want to pull a 20s, you have to be, you have to do something different than Rod. I think like you have to be trading more frequently.
00:34:04.673 - 00:34:22.481, Speaker A: But like the AI memes. Right? I mean act, I mean no one could have predicted act. Right. It wasn't really a fundamental thing. It was just like a listing. But it literally like 40x, you know, overnight, like goat went from like 100 mil or like it was like zero to a billion. It was the first billion dollar pump.
00:34:22.481 - 00:34:23.697, Speaker A: Fun coin. Yeah.
00:34:23.801 - 00:34:43.275, Speaker B: The last like really obvious trade that I've seen is gold. But I didn't get into it. I think I got in around 100. So it did a 10x. But even gold, the market was so efficient. It took like two days to go from zero to 300.
00:34:43.855 - 00:34:44.635, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:44.975 - 00:34:52.955, Speaker B: So if you want to pull 20x or more, you have to be really glued to the, to the screen 24 7.
00:34:53.495 - 00:35:30.045, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's, it's like this. I, I've seen this tweet last cycle, but you know, for the next six months, just lock in, you know, like, because after you assuming that you like make it right, quote, unquote, make it, then you can like just chill for the next two years to just like prioritize logging in for the next couple months. Because this, this, this is where champions are made. You know, this is where champions are born. This is where main characters are born. What do you think are the implications of, I mean, go hitting like. I think you own like, you know, a bunch of goat.
00:35:30.045 - 00:36:00.055, Speaker A: One, one question I had is, you know, goat is at, at the time recording 900 mil. Act is at 600, roughly. I think earlier it was like 800 mil to 700 mil. I personally don't think it's going to be flipped. I think that's like, not really likely. But if it does get flipped, don't you think that's pretty bearish, Goat? Because the point of goat is like it's like the first thing, right? So if it gets flipped by like a random binance coin, then surely that could be bearish the sector. Or maybe it's bullish like the small caps, but like bearish goat.
00:36:00.055 - 00:36:01.835, Speaker A: Like have you ever thought about that?
00:36:02.495 - 00:36:21.895, Speaker B: No, I've never thought about that. I feel like most people don't even know act like I think, I think the goat owners and act owners are. Are two mutually exclusive demographics because one is in the trenches on chain, the other one is on binance.
00:36:22.275 - 00:36:55.649, Speaker A: That's true. That's true. Maybe the act crowd is like more trader like paper hands like PvP and then goat is trying to be more PvE. I'm curious right now. You mentioned earlier that you're just bitcoin Salana coinbase as your core portfolio and then core position and then you just like, you know, have a meme coin position. When was the first time you've like just embraced meme coins as a sector? Was it like did you just get it like the first or second cycle or. Or did it take time for you to internalize that? You know, people just want memes and like crypto is like a meme industry.
00:36:55.649 - 00:36:56.913, Speaker A: Meme coin industry.
00:36:57.089 - 00:37:15.095, Speaker B: Well, I mean I started trading meme coins in summer last year. I think the. The first one that, that I bought was bald. That was the. That was Brian Armstrong on base. That was actually really good meme. If you think about it, it's actually very easy to.
00:37:15.095 - 00:37:48.215, Speaker B: It's actually very hard to mid curve on memes because if a meme makes you laugh then it's probably a good sign. My criteria is the harder I laugh, the more I want to ape. That's one way. The other way is I show the meme to my daughter and see if she likes it. I mean like it's very hard to me curve on this. But anyway, so I embraced summer last year and then. But at that time I already knew memes.
00:37:48.215 - 00:38:18.033, Speaker B: I already understood memes because the previous cycle I kind of mid curved on NFTs. But if you really think about it, NFTs meme coins are just the next iteration of NFTs. It's the exact same thing. Exact same thing but in a different form. Fungible versus non fungible. Like NFTs was when I realized meme coins. How like the meme coin thing makes sense to me was last cycle I completely curve on Doge.
00:38:18.033 - 00:38:19.725, Speaker B: By the way, in the early days.
00:38:20.225 - 00:38:27.505, Speaker A: I completely mid curved it as well. I'm still mid curving. I don't even own Doge. But I probably. Oh, man.
00:38:28.045 - 00:38:33.665, Speaker B: Doge is kind of a. It's kind of an obvious trade and obvious trades tend to work really well in this market.
00:38:34.205 - 00:39:10.275, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's like really hard, right? Because I think the crypto natives that's been around for the past two years, they've been conditioned to take profits because things retrace PvP meta. But definitely feels like a regime shift to PvE, to player vs environment. How would you suggest someone to like, just really just embrace that? No, we are in a new regime and just like, how do you get over like the ptsd? You think? I asked this earlier too, but this is like something I'm dealing with. So I would like love to hear your. As a fourth cycler's advice.
00:39:11.295 - 00:39:15.475, Speaker B: I don't know, you just have to power through two more cycles in order to get.
00:39:17.015 - 00:39:17.795, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:18.635 - 00:39:22.131, Speaker B: Pd. PTSD will follow you for two more cycles, unfortunately.
00:39:22.163 - 00:39:41.171, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the ptsd. I. I just love this meme, the SAT start meme of like this first cycle, second cycle, third cycle. It's so true, you know, it's. It's just. It's just so true. Um, anyways, you know, this has been like a pretty un.
00:39:41.171 - 00:39:57.115, Speaker A: Unscripted conversation just because, I mean, I wake up, I'm euphoric. Actually, one question that I have for you is recently I've just been getting no sleep. You know, I've been taking melatonin because I just like, I just. There's just so much dopamine in my brain.
00:39:57.155 - 00:39:57.875, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:39:57.915 - 00:40:10.875, Speaker A: And like I go to bed and I'm like, doge. Doge. Doc coins. Meme coins. And then I wake up like 5:30am I'm like, wait, wait, hold on. Like, what are the prices? Right? And obviously, you know, that's. That's not healthy.
00:40:10.875 - 00:40:20.043, Speaker A: Um, it might be okay now, but at some point it'll catch up to me. You know, at some point I'll be sleep deprived and I'll make stupid decisions and like, you know, I'll lose like 50% of my portfolio or something.
00:40:20.139 - 00:40:20.555, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:20.635 - 00:40:32.815, Speaker A: So what are some good, I guess, good practices for a person that's like super locked in to take care of your mental health or, you know, maximize health, et cetera? Because I think that's something that's not really talked about.
00:40:33.475 - 00:40:50.505, Speaker B: Yeah. Monday, upper body. Tuesday, zone two. Wednesday, lower body. And do this till Saturday and then Sunday, do a hit four times for a hit. That's exercise. And then sleep.
00:40:50.505 - 00:41:08.395, Speaker B: Just do, I guess just one. Take two hours to wind down before going to bed. Like don't look at crypto. Don't open. Close all the tabs for two hours before going to bed. That's pretty much. And eat mostly healthy.
00:41:09.055 - 00:41:18.415, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess there has to be, like, people need to, like, detach crypto from, you know, your personal life.
00:41:18.575 - 00:41:58.355, Speaker B: Yeah, like what, what I, you know, we just discussed earlier about, like, how to turn 50020x. I think to do a 20x, you have to be glued to the computer, like, all your working hours. But it's not necessarily something I would recommend. Like, focusing on 20x is not necessarily a good thing. Even if you achieve it, you're going to sacrifice a lot of your health and relationships. Like, what I would do, probably just to take it easy. Just hold a few coins that you're high conviction in and then hold it for, like, you know, a few months until the market is really euphoric.
00:41:58.355 - 00:42:14.535, Speaker B: And this way you don't need to look at the market, you don't need to trade in and out. You can keep a pretty healthy lifestyle and you'll probably end up with like, maybe a 5x instead of 20x. But I think the difference is well justified.
00:42:15.395 - 00:42:34.575, Speaker A: Yeah. Comparison is a thief of joy. Right. It's just like, if you tell anyone that you got a 5X, it's like, wow, you're a God. But if you're on Twitter, it's like, dude, what's wrong with you? Right? Yeah, yeah. So I guess play to market to the best of your abilities. Just don't.
00:42:34.575 - 00:42:41.615, Speaker A: It's okay. Right? Like, you're only competing against yourself. There's going to be infinite opportunities in the markets.
00:42:42.035 - 00:43:33.085, Speaker B: And there's this such an amazing quote by Druckenmiller. So he won an interview recently and the interviewer said, you're a very competitive person. Who do you compete with? And Druck Miller said, you would imagine that Druck Miller would say some other hedge funds or the index, like S and P or like the name of some other head funds. But he said, I'm competing with the opportunity set. So in other words, he's looking at the set of all opportunities where he can make a profit and he tries to capture as much as possible out of these as opposed to comparing himself with his peers. I think it's a really good mentality. It's a healthy mentality and you'll probably end up winning more by embracing this mentality.
00:43:34.345 - 00:43:49.795, Speaker A: Yeah, I listened to the interview as well. Every Druckenmiller interview I watch, I read market wizards with Druckenmiller. I guess for you when you heard this and you were moved by it. How are you applying this to like where you are now?
00:43:55.015 - 00:44:39.455, Speaker B: Just ignore all the PNL screenshots on Twitter. Half of them are fake and the other half, like they're taking probably excessive risk that you shouldn't be taking anyway. In general, I just think it's much healthier mentally, physiologically and physically to get rich slow than to do like a hundred x per cycle. I think 5x a cycle is more than enough. And you do this over and over again and you end up making a lot of money and you end up not killing yourself and not killing your relationships. So like, yeah, getting rich slow is nice.
00:44:39.955 - 00:45:09.205, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess that's like an unpopular take because everyone wants to get rich fast. Yeah, but there's extreme survivorship bias in crypto. You hear all these fantastic stories of like 1k, like 500 bucks to 10 million or something, and then there's like nine, like two, like a million stories of people just like completely getting destroyed. But people only decide to consume what they want to hear, which is, you know, buy my bags and make a million dollars.
00:45:09.725 - 00:45:52.413, Speaker B: And even like out of the handful of cases where people make like 100x, I feel like the vast majority of them suffer from some degree of sudden wealth syndrome. Like, meaning they can like too much ego and then just handle. Can't handle the emotion of getting so rich so quick. You know, burn all the bridges with their friends and family and business relationships or just outright getting liquidated like three arrows. Or getting into outright crimes like FTX and Terra.
00:45:52.589 - 00:46:22.325, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's this quote, I forget who said this last cycle, but making it by yourself is not fun. The best feeling is making it with your friends. So, you know, crypto is a community. Right. And even meme coins, they're tokenized communities. The reason they have they're so popular is because you buy, you join the community, you ship, post together on Twitter, you get engagement and you feel amazing about yourself. Right? That's like the menu and then you, maybe you make money as well.
00:46:22.325 - 00:46:52.095, Speaker A: So yeah, you know, I try to play long term games with long term people. Right. I try to be a good actor to the best of my abilities and whatnot. I guess there's like this idea of your network, your network is your net worth. And I think we're both in a privileged position to like, you know, have friends in the industry. But for someone that is just getting in, or maybe they only have like 50 followers on Twitter, what do you think, like they should do? To, you know, try to find their hive mind or you know, their group.
00:46:53.435 - 00:47:28.545, Speaker B: Just get deep into one specific topic. It could be meme coins. It could be like the super high tech stuff like ZK or whatever, or high throughput blockchains or whatever. Just get very deep in one topic and put out really, really good content. People will see it and people will like crypto Twitter is like a lot of people are jaded by crypto Twitter, but I still think it's a pretty amazing place. Like if you put out, especially in this cycle where a lot of the content is kind of garbage, if you put out like semi good content, people will notice it. People will read your content and people will retweet.
00:47:28.545 - 00:47:37.425, Speaker B: Many will slid into your dms, some of whom are like very successful people. And you will meet the right people there. Just put out good content.
00:47:37.885 - 00:47:43.869, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to put yourself out there. Like I'm very introverted, but I still just pump content whenever I can.
00:47:43.917 - 00:47:57.703, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean you run two podcasts and then you go to all these events and then do like you know, side events with, with your, your, your audience, your fans. You gotta, you gotta just put yourself out there.
00:47:57.879 - 00:48:21.897, Speaker A: Yeah. And it always feels like yearly, right. When I started making videos in 2020, it felt like, oh, the YouTube game is saturated, but there's always a niche, right? You have to put yourself out there and that's how you really find, you know, your friends or you know, like a community that you can like resonate with. So thank you for your time. Ciao. You know, I really appreciated the meme coin discussion. I'm finally getting there.
00:48:21.897 - 00:48:35.721, Speaker A: Do you have any final words for audience today? You know, they're, I'm sure they're like me. They have just have so much dopamine in their heads. They, they're like, what? Like how do I be allocated? You know, they, you know, this is the time to like lock in like as a for cycler, like.
00:48:35.793 - 00:48:36.185, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:36.265 - 00:48:37.609, Speaker A: Any final words of advice?
00:48:37.777 - 00:49:30.835, Speaker B: I have something broader than crypto. I just feel extremely optimistic about the US Obviously that has to do with this up and coming administration, but I think there is a clear focus on reducing the size of the government and basically going back to the roots of the founding values of America, which is smaller governments and big individuals that will ultimately attract the best people, the smartest people to this country. In crypto, for example, I think we're going to see a rise in entrepreneurship in US from like founders from all over the world will come to the U.S. we already hear this by the way in DEFCON, people are saying they're moving back to the U.S. so I'm just really optimistic about the industry and the country in general.
00:49:31.135 - 00:50:18.501, Speaker A: No, I agree. When I went to Singapore, there were so many founders that moved from us to Singapore because they just couldn't build in the US but now that you know, there's more optimism in the air, maybe there's going to be more innovation and maybe the crypto market right now maybe is not so serious. Maybe it'll become more serious, and maybe the fact that the reason it's so unserious is because of the regulatory regime. But now maybe in the next five years, we're going to start to see, like, actual use cases. Not to say that, you know, we don't have any use cases, but, you know, maybe more consumer apps, which I know, like, you're really bullish on. Actually, as a final plug, do you want to say anything about Alliance? I know you guys have been killing it. You know, Dallas Fun Daos, Fund, Pump Fun, all these amazing apps.
00:50:18.501 - 00:50:23.785, Speaker A: Like what? Like, what have you learned? Like, funding and, like, working with all these developers and entrepreneurs.
00:50:24.165 - 00:50:53.525, Speaker B: Oh, I learned so many things. But I guess for your audience, if there's founders or future founders in your audience, I would love to talk to you. Especially ones that have a high degree of childhood trauma and autism. I would love to. Oh, yeah, that is one thing I learned over the last four years. Like, it sounds like a joke, but some of the best founders are the ones that went through a lot of trauma when they're young and they're. They're highly autistic.
00:50:54.545 - 00:51:26.805, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I listen to the podcast and I think I DM'd you about it. Yeah, I'm not sure how autistic I am, but I definitely have childhood trauma, and I think that's also the reason why I'm just so. So driven. Yeah, like. Like, I. Okay, so maybe I shouldn't, like, you know, end the episode on, like, a downer, but, like, I lost my mom to cancer, like, when I was young, and that kind of sucked at the time. But, like, looking back, like, that was, like, the turning point where I just started to really focus on school and I just, like, went to good college.
00:51:26.805 - 00:51:39.485, Speaker A: I don't really, like, my college degree doesn't really mean much in crypto, honestly. But I think it kind of allowed me to just really work for myself and just try to achieve the most with my life.
00:51:41.465 - 00:51:43.885, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm really sorry to hear. I didn't know this.
00:51:44.185 - 00:51:52.805, Speaker A: Oh, no, it's okay. It's okay. It's not like a sad thing. But everyone goes through shit, right? Yeah.
00:51:53.785 - 00:52:04.273, Speaker B: Every person that I know that's super driven and motivated have gone through something traumatic during their formative years, and that's how you know.
00:52:04.329 - 00:52:21.549, Speaker A: And I guess that's like a common denominator. And now that I now I'm using my childhood trauma to ape meme coins. I'm embracing. I'm in the meme coin trenches. If you're in the meme coin trenches, I'm coming for you. You know, I'm coming for you guys. I'll see you.
00:52:21.549 - 00:52:27.533, Speaker A: I'll. I'll see you in the trenches. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. Ciao. Really enjoy the conversation.
00:52:27.589 - 00:52:28.653, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me on.
00:52:28.749 - 00:52:29.533, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
00:52:29.629 - 00:52:30.269, Speaker B: Take care.
