00:00:00.200 - 00:00:40.026, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Farmer Taiki here. And welcome to episode one of Farmer's Market, where I'm joined by Andy to discuss on chain topics and I guess any yield opportunities that you want us to talk about? Quite honestly, we're literally just winging this. There's not that much preparation that went into this. I just tweeted, I literally just tweeted, hey, we're just going to collect audience questions and we'll be brutally honest about something. Whether something is worth farming, something is going to go to zero. And for anyone that doesn't know who Andy is, I just had him on my channel with crypto market wizards. He's been pretty successful navigating on chain.
00:00:40.026 - 00:00:52.710, Speaker A: Maybe not so recently because I mean, there was this news today where Jumper, the bridge aggregator, got exploited. Can you talk about your experience? Were you hit by this exploit and how you're going to navigate on chain moving forward?
00:00:53.490 - 00:01:19.690, Speaker B: Yeah. So I had some resting approvals from, from many months ago from some like airdrop farming or alt wallets that I used. And I got lazy because I didn't want to approve it every single time. So I put an infinite approval and usually I usually I sweep all these wallets, empty them out and never use them again. So I completely forgot about their existence. And today I found out that I lost like ten, like 13, $14,000 in this exploit. I thought I lost more.
00:01:19.690 - 00:01:41.490, Speaker B: So I was a little worried because I knew I had some money left in these wallets. I didn't have that much leftover. So, not to end the world, but it does hurt. And it does remind you to either not give too much approvals, like only approved for how much you're going to spend on the contract immediately, or to approve, like revoke your approvals pretty regularly to ensure your safety.
00:01:41.990 - 00:02:25.938, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think if anyone is worried about potential exploits, one thing you can do is instead of like revoking every approval, you can just send your coins to a fresh address and then that way you can start from zero. That's something that I think about doing every single year. And in terms of the exploit, this, to my knowledge, literally, we're recording this 30, 40 minutes after this news came out. But whenever you bridge through jumper and you're sending something, I'm not endorsing DMT here, but for example, you have to approve how many tokens you're going to send, um, to the, you know, to this contract. And generally the default is that it only approves whatever you have in your wallet. So if you did this then you're totally fine.
00:02:25.938 - 00:02:42.388, Speaker A: Um, if you manually change it to infinite, right, like USDC or something, then you know, you might be exploited. Um, but just, you know, some, I guess something to keep, keep in mind. Just never do infinite approvals unless it's for something that you really believe in, like Uniswap, Aave, etcetera.
00:02:42.474 - 00:03:11.422, Speaker B: I guess it kind of enforces the idea of a famous saying that there are bridges that haven't exploited and the bridges that aren't exploited yet. That's kind of how I feel. Of course this wasn't a bridge exploit, was an aggregator exploit. But every single time I use bridges nowadays, I feel kind of bad. I think multi chain getting exploited was like shortly after I started using binance or coinbase for bridging, like started using exchanges. So it kind of like hit me more. Like as soon as I started exchanges, all these bridges kind of started going down.
00:03:11.422 - 00:03:50.470, Speaker B: I'm like, wow, like it, it's definitely better to, if you have exchange accounts to use it. And if you're using bridges, it's very important to be very wary of the privilege you make, how, which type of bridge it is and all sorts of that. Because there's two types of bridges. One is if they just give you a balance that's canonically bridged to a different chain. For example, if you use orbiter and you get Ethereum on arbitrum, but it's for arbitrum bridge, which is a completely different security profile from, say, if I say this, I feel like I'm fighting someone pretty badly. But say like Connext and you're using like Renzo E. That's like minted by Connex.
00:03:50.470 - 00:04:14.164, Speaker B: Like, or what are they called now? They have a new name, right? I forgot what they're rebranded. But if you, if you rely your security on something like this, like a, like a smaller company, then if their security gets compromised, then your brush tokens also get a compromise, which is usually the case. So you kind of want to share your security slash keep your british assets in the most safe way possible, right?
00:04:14.292 - 00:04:49.400, Speaker A: And you know, the, the worst news out of all this is that, you know, this exploit just delayed the airdrop by another six months. So airdrop farmers were, you know, we're dying out here. And Brian Anderson, like down here is like, no, you know, I feel the same. I've been using jumper like whenever I can because I mean, it is a pretty good product. I mean, it's a bridge aggregator, right? But the reason we want to talk about Jumper is because of the optivism superfest. Yay. And I'm not really sure if this is sponsored by jumper, but if you go back to this main page here, let me just go to the top.
00:04:49.400 - 00:05:40.910, Speaker A: Optimus Superfest. I guess it's not a real festival, but some on chain festival, and it has all these, I guess, partners LRT's defi projects. You can drag this thing and just whatever you bridge, you participate, you enjoy. I know you get a wristband. So it's like we're being accepted into a frat party. And what you can do is you can go to jumper exchange Superfest. So maybe it's not worth bridging right now, but you can go to this website and you can scroll through all these incentives and any of these things that have the OPD badge thing, they have incentives, for example, if you join, or if you explore, like this aave thing, if you borrow USDC on base, you get to participate in some share of the 58,000 op.
00:05:40.910 - 00:05:52.402, Speaker A: So I guess, Andy, I have a question for you. Are you going to farm any of this? Is it worth farming? And. Yeah, just general thoughts on whether you're bullish on these types of initiatives.
00:05:52.506 - 00:06:34.070, Speaker B: So, in terms of this, I'm not actively going to farm the optimism superfest. I do appreciate that. They're giving me free money as we speak right now, because I'm farming the Etherfi loop on a, which lets you loan out Reith and borrow eth, and I'm getting paid op from both sides of the loop. So as of now, I remember I've been paid out like two or $300, which I'm never gonna turn down, free money. So thank you. I'll claim it someday and sell it, but not right now. I was looking at how the reward, the amount of rewards that gives, or how it's composed, how it's made in the ecosystem.
00:06:34.070 - 00:07:07.942, Speaker B: And I don't think it's a difference maker for someone who's not interested at all to go and participate all of a sudden. But I think it's not a bad amount. The amount definitely makes pretty convincing. If you're already pretty active on optimism or base, you want to, like, I don't know, you want to trade meme points, or you have some money lying around the base, and now there's some reason for you to say, lend to aave, try some random defi things. So, definitely a net plus net positive. I was looking at silo and some other ways to farm liquid op tokens and get aprs, and it wasn't. It wasn't too bad at all.
00:07:07.942 - 00:07:39.100, Speaker B: I was actually looking at it, and I know 30 seconds ago I said, it's not good enough for me to make it different decision. But if your portfolio is, like, somewhere within, like, the five to six figures range, I think you can put some money here and get some real money. I think we're getting sick and tired of points and optimism tokens are real money, by all means, like, purposes. And it did look like something ranging towards a 20% to 40% APR, which is pretty competitive, if you think about it. So, yeah, pretty good. Thumbs up. Thank you all.
00:07:39.660 - 00:07:46.356, Speaker A: All right, all right. This is the optimism superfest. Got a thumbs up by, you know, by both Andy, and if you're giving.
00:07:46.388 - 00:07:48.436, Speaker B: Us free money, give thumbs up.
00:07:48.628 - 00:07:59.840, Speaker A: You give thumbs up. Yeah. And maybe my editor can just, you know, put some confetti here to do some superfast vibes. Wasn't silo exploited, like, some time ago?
00:08:02.420 - 00:08:34.506, Speaker B: I'm not sure about an exploit. What happened during the easy connect was that they didn't. They didn't successfully liquidate people. And what I didn't like about their approach was, I may be wrong here, but how I recall it was people who were kind of supporting silo were showing Silo saying that they protected user money, and I was like, wait, so they didn't liquidate people? And now people are saying that was good, which I found to be kind of absurd, because if. If the price goes down, the job is to liquidate people.
00:08:34.698 - 00:08:35.026, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:35.058 - 00:08:51.450, Speaker B: You should not liquidate people and then save when the price goes back up. Since we didn't liquidate people, we save money. You should say something horrible happened here. We need to fix this. So that's my only take on silo. I don't think that is Silo's official opinion. It is just some people who support the silo team or the silo token.
00:08:51.450 - 00:08:57.918, Speaker B: So I'm not going to take with a grain of salt. But that's like, what, something that happened once, and that's kind of like, what I remember from it.
00:08:58.114 - 00:09:23.290, Speaker A: Yeah, like, one way. Because I'm like, you know, on chain and from, like, if I put my trader hat on. Right? If I take my farmer hat off and, like, my trader hat on, I was also thinking, is there any way to bet on these tokens? Right? Because if they're getting op token incentives, maybe that can help adoption to protocol. For example, Spectra, I think this is formally called AP wine, and it's trying to be like a Dependo competitor their TBL has.
00:09:23.670 - 00:09:24.222, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:24.286 - 00:09:34.046, Speaker A: Yeah. Their tv all kind of skyrocketed recently. Like do you ever look at things like this? Like is it worth, I mean, by the way, like, you know, I own zero spectra tokens. I honestly don't care what happens to this project.
00:09:34.118 - 00:09:35.170, Speaker B: They have a token.
00:09:35.670 - 00:09:38.046, Speaker A: I think they have a token. I think it's called AP one.
00:09:38.078 - 00:09:40.878, Speaker B: I have a pretty AP wide. So they must have a token. You're right.
00:09:40.974 - 00:09:47.970, Speaker A: Yeah. Like do you think it's worth speculating? You know, we're speculating on these things like this. Maybe TVL continues to go up.
00:09:51.240 - 00:10:35.070, Speaker B: I think if you want to, if you try these things, and personally I'm not going to try these because I'm lazy. But if you try these apps and you think it's a pretty seamless experience, it's perfectly fine to buy these tokens, speculate on them. My problem with these is that when I use an on chain yield leveraging platform, if I'm buying ten k worth of yield tokens like the pendle yt, that means I'm getting like million dollars of like 300. Anywhere between like three hundred k to five hundred k worth of net exposure to the underlying token. So if the Tvl is 25 mil, then I have a feeling that the slippage would be too big for me to fit in any size that I want to put into any of these platforms. So I just don't use them at all and never get to find out like if they're good or bad.
00:10:35.490 - 00:11:09.224, Speaker A: Got it. So I guess the takeaway here is that, you know, like if you have the time and you're interested, I guess these incentives, external incentives, it gives you a good reason to go to base, fractal, optimus, whatever, all these chains and use it. If you have a good experience and you can potentially form a poll case, maybe it makes sense to buy those tokens. But generally I think the majority of these use cases is to just bridge USDCE, whatever, just farm and dump and be happy with free money. Do you kind of agree it's kind.
00:11:09.232 - 00:11:27.620, Speaker B: Of like nice if you use these apps and they give you their tokens, kind of like s incentives for free, and you can kind of try it out if you like and you keep them and then you check back in six months and oh my God, they've ten x, now they're $5,000 or $10,000. That's kind of my positive experience with a lot of these apps. Less so than buying the tokens and speculating on them.
00:11:27.920 - 00:11:44.310, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. I think that's enough time spent on jumper and optimism or just whatever superfast thing is. Let's move on to this thing. Another audience question I got is hyper liquid. So samurai, right? A big fan of the channel. Also a humble, humble former army member.
00:11:44.310 - 00:12:21.370, Speaker A: You know, he, you know, he believes. He believes he's a bull, right? He believes in this guy. The. I mean, you know, this. This account name is called the $800 per point hyper liquid retard. And he kind of goes over his bullcase for why he thinks every point is gonna be worth $800, you know, I mean, like, whatever, right? Like, whenever you see these moon boy masks, like, what do you think? Like, and, like, in your head? Like, how many or how much are each points worth in your head for hyperloop? Because I know you farmed it pretty heavily.
00:12:21.990 - 00:12:26.774, Speaker B: Dude, why is he fighting? It's not worth a least $20,000 per.
00:12:26.942 - 00:12:32.680, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. I mean, I'll be very happy. How many points do you have, if you don't mind sharing?
00:12:34.260 - 00:12:36.000, Speaker B: Around 100k, give or take.
00:12:36.420 - 00:12:39.404, Speaker A: Okay, so $800. I mean, that's. You're a million.
00:12:39.452 - 00:12:42.212, Speaker B: I mean, global economy around there.
00:12:42.316 - 00:13:02.864, Speaker A: I mean, obviously, I hope this happens. I only have like 1500 points because I barely did anything. But I guess a more interesting topic is per, right? So I sold my per at like $0.08 because I'm stupid. Well, actually, maybe it was a little higher, but like under $0.10, essentially. And per has been one of the best performers.
00:13:02.864 - 00:13:10.600, Speaker A: I mean, the last couple of months. You hold it, you get points. You also get airdrops of, I guess, all these other tokens. Right? You can see here.
00:13:10.760 - 00:13:11.540, Speaker B: Endless.
00:13:12.120 - 00:13:38.560, Speaker A: Yeah, endless. And I'm just going to pick a random one like Jeff or something. Yeah, I mean, look at this. I mean, you get this airdrop, and Jeff, who's the founder of Hyper Liquid, it just keeps going up. So I guess I don't, like, I'm not really participating in this thing because I sold my tokens because I'm a mid curve. But do you still own your per? Did you sell and. Yeah, like, how are you playing this, if you don't mind?
00:13:39.060 - 00:14:00.220, Speaker B: So I think my airdrop was around 2 million per, give or take. And I actually sold most of my per on the first, first at, then on the second pump to. Then I bought back at like $0.13 on a couple wallets. So I have around the same exposure. A little less. I think I have 1.75
00:14:00.220 - 00:14:35.200, Speaker B: million per total. I sold some today, so I think a little less. I've been, I've been selling the past day, basically I started selling today, and my thoughts on this is that it's, it's a good token. I think it's representative of people's bullishness on one, a app that definitely has PMF that's been pretty rare in crypto for the past year and a half. And second, it's just, it is utility. Like most people, when they hold things, they don't get anything, but in hyper liquid, they get new coins, which feels good. The new coins go up, which feels even better.
00:14:35.200 - 00:15:14.260, Speaker B: Now, I use this as a counterpoint saying that now, if people are happy holding per for these reasons, then that just means that it's overpriced because you're getting an airdrop, and then the coin going up actually only accounts for like three to 5% of the token's value, like to pers the amount of dollar worth of product you're holding. So if people are so excited about this, then it's probably getting priced in for more than 5% of its value. So I was thinking, okay, like $0.20, like pretty much new all time highs. I like the current price. I'm just gonna sell and see where it goes. So I started selling at saw.
00:15:14.260 - 00:15:22.040, Speaker B: My twap ended at 20.4 cents today. So yeah, I'm going to continue to sell if it's above twenty cents and see where it goes.
00:15:22.580 - 00:15:48.270, Speaker A: Got it. And I mean, the main reason, of course, there's like some speculative activity going on here. But one of the reasons per has done well is because you hold spot. Sorry? Yeah, I mean, you hold spot and you get points, right? So let's say the airdrop happens next week, right? I mean, I have no idea when, but when the airdrop happens, like, what happens to all these tokens? Are they just going to go down or can they keep going up? Like, what do you think happens there?
00:15:48.390 - 00:16:28.460, Speaker B: I'm only going to assume that they've already had a season two for points before the token. So what stops them from having a season three, season four, season five? It's an l one. Like a l one liquidity mining l one, incentivization, whatever. Where using these spot markets gives you like incentives in hyper liquid tokens. If it's an l one, then this definitely gonna happen. And they're definitely not, they're not actually like, Jeff is not actually going to airdrop 50% of the supply in the first airdrop or I would assume so. So I think these on chain tokens will have a continuous long term flow of incentives.
00:16:28.460 - 00:16:43.950, Speaker B: How much is that? Or like what that is, is kind of hard of value or I have no idea. I'm just looking at the per price that kind of like fall alive and I'm like, oh, I'm right, look at that. It's below $0.20 now. But anyways.
00:16:46.370 - 00:17:00.568, Speaker A: I mean, if you didn't sell, it would be higher. So I mean, this is your fault, right? Causing pain to the per holders. You know, you're literally top ticking selling here. I mean, the chart looks good, right? I mean, higher highs, higher lows. I mean, I'm not going to bet.
00:17:00.584 - 00:17:35.868, Speaker B: Against, I think the people who are holding per at the end of the day will be moderately disappointed given current price. Of course I'm selling, so I'm pretty bearish. But at any given price at the time of the airdrop, I'm only going to assume like if per is at a dollar, when hyperlocal air drops, they'll be very unhappy with how much they're getting relative to the dollar that per is worth. So my mentality is, okay, so may as well just sell per. That's my mentality. I think. I think once the airdrop happens and people are disappointed, people will start selling, it'll go down a lot.
00:17:35.868 - 00:17:53.250, Speaker B: And at that point it'll be undervalued. Because I do believe that above all things, age, fund and per will probably have longer term value, whether that be like on chain incentives and hyperlocker tokens or whatever comes.
00:17:54.070 - 00:18:11.326, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, I think we talked enough about hyper liquid. I think we're like 20 minutes in. We're almost 20 minutes in. So I do want to move on to the next topic. And, you know, so I posted this. Right? Like, what would you like us to cover this week? And you know, like I scroll down optivism super fast.
00:18:11.326 - 00:18:35.504, Speaker A: Oh, hyper fod, hyper liquid, yada yada yada. And there's a lot of these Infinix shills. There's like Defi Isaac, I'm assuming he works for Infinix because there's this logo, there's, what is it? Shaman here, he's like a mod. Okay, cool. Infinix intern. He wants us to talk about Infinix, this guy. Intern, ok.
00:18:35.504 - 00:19:04.294, Speaker A: I mean dust or moon. So these infinix employees, whoever, this guy, right? I head mod, okay? Like people want us to talk about, yeah, insane hit rate. And we did say we're going to be brutally honest about what these things are. So let's talk about Infinix. I mean, there's like this crate season, or like there's like this crate run where you bridge capital or you deposit capital and then, like, have you looked into this? Like, how does it work?
00:19:04.382 - 00:19:18.310, Speaker B: Like, broadly and have lightly looked into this? Not too seriously. So I don't know. So if you actually know how this works, you probably need to tell me on it. I know, like, very casually the mechanism of this.
00:19:18.850 - 00:19:46.562, Speaker A: Yeah. So to my knowledge. So maybe, you know, I don't want to spread misinformation. Right. Because maybe we're not that educated. But I guess where we're both coming from is we saw this and we just kind of, okay, I'm not going to speak for you, but, like, for me, me personally, I looked at this, right? It's like Cain's project. It's trying to become this, you know, some account abstraction, this defi wallet, you know, one spot to trade bridge trade purpose and whatnot.
00:19:46.562 - 00:20:24.950, Speaker A: And I'm like, you know, like, I don't, I don't. I don't want to farm this. Right? It's like there's like, I don't. I feel like my capital is better off elsewhere because, like, how much can this platform actually be worth? I'm not quite sure. And if you actually look at, I guess, the crate run basics, when this first got announced, I went to the discord and I asked some mods, and what they told me was that if you bridge, you earn points and crates, and these crates give you an opportunity to get some nfT that gives you access to some token sale. And maybe if you bridge enough capital, you get these things for free. But I think that's how it works.
00:20:24.950 - 00:20:46.450, Speaker A: You bridge, you get nfTs. NFTs allow you to participate in some token sale at some, whatever the valuation is. And I think the valuation was like 100 mil or something, which I was like, I do not want to buy this project for 100 million. So I was like, okay, I honestly don't care. That's literally how I thought about this. How did you think about this?
00:20:46.570 - 00:21:22.882, Speaker B: Pretty much the same. I looked at it and I was a little, I actually agree with Kane's specific argument that just by bridging money on the platform, they convince people that this platform is worth, I think, candidates specifically tweet about it. I know you don't have it up, and so I'm going to quote him. It was like, if there's $100 million bridged to our Infinix app account extraction, that proves that people are willing to trust $100 million with us. That adds credibility to our platform, which is true. And right now I'm putting my thumbs up. You can't see it, but I think that's a really cool idea.
00:21:22.882 - 00:21:49.126, Speaker B: But I don't think that's enough for me to be convinced to buy the app. As far as I'm concerned, Synthetix hasn't been necessarily the hottest perps as of now. So this new kind of branch out using Infinix, using like these, I think it's using Synthetix as the underlying engine. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Doesn't seem like that bullish to me.
00:21:49.318 - 00:22:07.890, Speaker A: I think it's supposed to be like an aggregator of everything. Like spot Dexs perp, Dexs bridges. It's trying to be this passport, like secure passport to defi so you don't have to worry about going to uniscover Jupiter. Yeah, it's more. Yeah, it's more infrast. And I guess maybe they think that they can charge fees.
00:22:09.830 - 00:23:01.178, Speaker B: That's great. I just don't want to buy it. There you go. I think there's too many steps between me getting points to getting crates to buy some NFT to whatever. I think that's to one that's way too complicated to his, his huge thing. Like at launch, Kane or somebody on Infinix posted a tweet about how they're going to have a two track system siloing off smaller wallets and bigger wallets to kind of like do something to make sure bigger wallets have enough upside while smaller wallets don't get diluted. And that made no sense to me because if there is a, there's a certain amount of rewards to be paid out to everyone who's playing in this pool, then if any segregated to whales or smaller, like wallets, then somebody's getting a worse deal than the other and whatever that is.
00:23:01.178 - 00:23:29.140, Speaker B: I don't want to play that game because then I didn't think it was good enough for me to do research on. Do I need to DM Kane saying I'm going to put $2 million into Infinix or do I need to find, do I need to cook up 3000 wallets, deposit $1,000 each? Like there's two ways to go about it. And clearly if I need to play this game, I need to know that and then I need to know about the prizes and the crates and the nfts. And I was like, okay, like, I'm just not going to study that hard.
00:23:29.720 - 00:24:11.686, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe they tried to make it fun, right? It's like, oh, you get these crates and it opens and you get NFT. But I think adding all the, all this complexity just turns me off at this point. And like, I'm not even sure how much these things can be worth anyways. And then after that, the complexity, it's like, okay, like, I have limited amount of brain capacity, limited amount of time. I'm not gonna think about this. Right? And I'd rather farm other lrts and scroll or Linia and whatnot. And speaking of which, you know, like, what do you think about Linia's 17th season of Galaxy quests? Are you still farming that thing? There's also like a bunch of all these things like korok, mitosis, hyperlucid, or, I mean, we talked about hyperlink, scroll.
00:24:11.718 - 00:24:39.774, Speaker B: I've not done a single quest for Linia, so I have no idea. I just did the perfect humanity once because they told me to do it and then farm some points. And that is about it because I farm, like, the five points, not the quests. So I have no idea what's going on in that front. I hope they stop doing it because the more they do it, the more airdrops they need to give to questers, which I think I made that tweet a couple days ago. I was like, yeah, I'm not that excited. Like, oh, God, I'm so excited to share my governance rights with these happy questers.
00:24:39.774 - 00:25:14.990, Speaker B: And I was being very sarcastic. And that's kind of how I feel about this line of quests or whatever that comes. Because the more you milk your community in these, the more unhappy that the farmers, like investors, are, the more diluted my airdrop is and the more likely people are to sell those coins. And if people, if these change or foundations or projects feel that they need to do this, to feel like they're engaging more with the community, they probably could go ahead. But most likely is they're just pissing people off. Right. Or making at least minimally tired.
00:25:15.650 - 00:25:48.046, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, whenever these teams milk the community, I just view it as, okay, the team knows that once they do a token, TVL is going to leave and their product is just not good. So they're going to just keep delaying the token, just keep pushing things back. That's how I view it. You mentioned something interesting around, I guess, pissing the community off and then just dumping your tokens. So Lithia kind of brought this up. Would be interesting to hear how the mechanics of an airdrop criteria plays in the price action.
00:25:48.046 - 00:26:10.896, Speaker A: For instance, eigen and symbiotic maybe sees less dumping since there's no real cost to farm them. While blast blur had large farms trying to get to breakeven immediately. So do you think this type of thought process has merit, or do you think that if it's easy to farm, then is it more likely that people will sell or less likely? How do you think about that?
00:26:11.008 - 00:26:47.812, Speaker B: Well, I don't know if blast or blur. Well, I know blur was, but I don't know if blast was hard to farm at all. For example, I think most of the blur allocations were given to pretty straightforward, like, deposit and earn type of technology like strategy. I think the people who kind of, like, grinded for blast gold and lost money on the way are a very vocal minority because they're like degens. But I don't think that was very representative of where the tokens went. For blur is definitely not the case. I think people lost a lot of money farming blur, so people were very clean to dump.
00:26:47.812 - 00:27:20.450, Speaker B: So price action could be a little worse in terms of eigen and symbiotic. I actually disagree that these have less cell pressure, because I feel like the ones that are farming them are much bigger industrial, like, bigger fund operations where their goal is to have crypto exposure and return more than 5% under Eth to their lp's. So if they see eigen token drop and they got like 12%, and they're like, great. Like, we've outperformed heavily, everyone's happy. All we need to do is sell the tokenization. They sell the token.
00:27:20.950 - 00:27:45.054, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I agree. I think the easier it is to farm, the more likely people are to sell. Of course, it depends on the project. I mean, I never. I only farmed blur season one. I bought, like, two pudgy penguins and some little pudgies, and then I just, like, fucked off for season two and whatnot. But I think the harder people work for an airdrop, it makes me believe that they're actually bullish to project.
00:27:45.054 - 00:28:28.490, Speaker A: Right. Because if you're not bullish blur, why would you farm it so aggressively? Maybe at this point, people just fucked up, and there was some, I guess, sunk cost fallacy, and maybe people felt trapped and whatnot, but, yeah, I agree. All these lrts, all these l two s, people just deposit capital to earn 1020, 30% on their eth. So I think we're going to just see people dump. What do you think about their drop meter right now? Because we talked about it last week, a bunch of these tokens are just dumping. Do you ever feel like it's worth buying these tokens or just holding onto your airdrop hoping to sell higher? Or do you think that's kind of like a bad mentality to have and you just want to sell AsaP?
00:28:29.230 - 00:28:57.874, Speaker B: Well, for now, I think you still want to sell. I think the vibes will get better. I think the vibes definitely got better from the last time you chatted toward to now. I think I feel a lot more lively. I feel a lot more eager to say good things about tokens because I have a good mood. And I think many people feel the same where when the numbers become numbers we haven't seen before all time. Like we're hitting new all times high every single day, like we were in February, march, like people, people were pretty excited about apps that now we call our trash.
00:28:57.874 - 00:29:39.306, Speaker B: And I think the exact same thing will happen in some time. I'm not going to give it time because I'm not the best trader out there where we on these chains or in crypto in general, we will be pretty excited about apps that may not be the most innovational out of all things cough cough friend tech, but we will be pretty excited to play on these things. Now the valuations go up. Now people are incentivized or they're happy to be on these chains. If they're happy on the chains, they're making money. Being on these l two s that we currently think are worthless, now they have value, they have real users. We laugh at Zksync, we laugh at whatever, whatever chain that they don't airdrop because they don't have any real users anymore.
00:29:39.306 - 00:30:11.842, Speaker B: But if price is high enough, then they will have users to make money. Take the foundational grants, whatever. And I guess the bearish take is that it's very short lived. And these chains, these l two s or new l one s, whoever they are, only have maybe like a six to twelve month window to spend their ecosystem money to kind of get real user acquisition. But during that time it'll look great. And during that time coins will go up. I'm moderately sure of that.
00:30:11.842 - 00:30:19.230, Speaker B: I'm actually pretty bullish coins in general. I'm not going to hold them, I'm just going to hold eth. But I'm bullish that they'll go up.
00:30:20.570 - 00:30:26.666, Speaker A: You're bullish on yourself being able to sell higher. That's basically the thing you're trying to say.
00:30:26.818 - 00:30:47.542, Speaker B: I'm bullish markets. I'm bullish on the fact that most people who are djing enough to say listen to this, like listen to this podcast slash video or beyond CT, like replying or reading CT like three, three days like 3 hours a day will probably make like moderately significant sums of money just by like being around. I think that will happen.
00:30:47.726 - 00:30:48.062, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:48.086 - 00:30:52.490, Speaker B: No, different story, but I think people will make lots of money.
00:30:52.910 - 00:31:14.176, Speaker A: Yeah, I 100% agree. Yeah, I'm still pretty bullish crypto. I mean, I've been always bullish. But yeah, I think, you know, this year has been good, or it's been okay. Last year was a lot better. I think next year will be a lot more favorable, but the goal is to survive. So I think that's, that's good for now.
00:31:14.176 - 00:31:39.096, Speaker A: You know, this was episode one of a farmers market. Let me know what you think in the comment section. You know, like I said at the beginning, we're literally just winging this. Maybe I didn't do infinix justice in like, I'm trying to understand their crate run and whatnot, but maybe they made it too complicated, so maybe it's fair game. Alright, thanks guys. We'll see you guys next week. Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed the content.
