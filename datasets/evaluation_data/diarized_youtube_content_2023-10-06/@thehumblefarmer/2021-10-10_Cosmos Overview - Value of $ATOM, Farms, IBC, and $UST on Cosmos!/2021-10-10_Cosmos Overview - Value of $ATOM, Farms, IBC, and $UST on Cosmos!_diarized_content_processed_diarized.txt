00:00:03.440 - 00:00:15.690, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And today I'm very honored to invite crypto Cedo on the channel to discuss Cosmos, the farming opportunities available, airdrops and more. So thanks for coming on the channel. Crypto Cedo, how are you doing today?
00:00:16.550 - 00:00:27.358, Speaker B: I'm good. Thank you so much for inviting me. It's a really, really honor to be on. I'm pretty new to this whole crypto YouTube game, but yeah, we're excited to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:00:27.534 - 00:01:14.920, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm new to the crypto YouTube game, too. Like I had like a thousand subscribers at the end, at the beginning of the year. And like now, like, I guess there's a lot more mind share in like farming Defi and I think your channel has grown a lot in the past couple months as well, just because, I mean, cosmos, I mean, it's doing really well. And I feel like, you know, it's, whenever I cover ecosystems or when I do research on ecosystems, I love it when I like, see like a, if, like, if like a particular ecosystem has like one person, like extensively covering it just because it shows, it proves to me that, hey, like, they have a strong community. Like, this person cares a lot about the ecosystem and it helps me build my own conviction. So that being said, like, my question to you is, like, when did you get into crypto and like, how did you get like so deep into the weeds of like the cosmos ecosystem?
00:01:15.620 - 00:01:56.142, Speaker B: Yeah, I really agree with what you said. I think at the beginning when I started with YouTube, I was like, man, I don't know if I should have just focus on Cosmos because then I'm kind of like exclusive to that and I don't know how that's going to turn out. But now I also think more that when I want to learn about whatever Polkadot or Phantom now or whatever Solana, I would like to follow somebody who's mostly covering that and mostly putting all his time and efforts into that ecosystem. So I think that makes a lot of sense. My crypto journey, I think began early 2017. Back then, I washing university student hanging out with my best buddy Chris. And we're like, man, we have to do something with our lives, something different.
00:01:56.142 - 00:02:35.938, Speaker B: You know, we don't want to end up in a red race and yeah, do things that we don't love or don't enjoy. So we tried out a lot of things also how to make money online and this and that. And it was a cool time and it was really, really cool time, you know, just this phase to figure things out and stumbled upon bitcoin at that time. I think it crossed $1,000 for the first time in years. So it's like, man, why are people paying $1,000 for something that they can't see or feel or touch or whatever? But the thing is, this got me really hooked to try to understand how money works. I had no idea. So I'm actually, I had a business background.
00:02:35.938 - 00:03:34.550, Speaker B: I was, like, studying economics, but I didn't really understand how money works, how commercial banks work, how credit works, how central banks. So kind of like this hook of bitcoin with the price increase got me into studying financial, the financial system, right? And it took me half a year almost from that moment to, like, buying my first cryptocurrency. And then, you know, that was luckily before this crazy December run, but I made so much money. And then in 2018, 2019, I lost everything because I was not ready to, like, you know, deal with finances, deal with investing. I had very little experience up until that point in terms of managing my own funds and money and those kind of things. And I think now, in retrospect, that was probably one of the most important things is to kind of, like, lose it all at least once, to kind of, like, feel and suffer, you know, and, like, really have this personal experience so that, you know what things you should avoid in the future. So that was kind of, like, my entry.
00:03:34.550 - 00:04:14.460, Speaker B: And I've seen during that time in 2018, 2019, so many people, they just left crypto because they got hooked in 2017 at the peak, and then they left because they were not interested in it. But I was so convinced of this ideological and also long term vision of blockchain, decentralized or distributed ledger technology that I sticked around for ever since. Ever since 2017. Really deep and built communities. Traveled a lot around the world. Yeah. Got back to Germany, which is where I'm originally from, in 2020 when the pandemic began.
00:04:14.460 - 00:04:18.680, Speaker B: I'm like, man, I should just get a mic and start recording. And here we are.
00:04:19.420 - 00:04:46.384, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. I also have a business background, but, like, I went to business school, but I never really learned about money. I feel like bitcoin has taught me more about how money works than a four year college education, which is kind of funny to think about. Yeah. Yeah. I guess, like, once you get into the crypto rabbit hole, it, like, kind of makes you, like, think about money and I guess, like, how the world works, like, more critically and.
00:04:46.384 - 00:05:15.316, Speaker A: Yeah, like, you joined in 2017, like, you got wrecked. I feel like everyone that I have on the show joined in 2017, got wrecked, and then, like, they came back stronger. Like, me personally, I got in crypto last year, and then, like, all I experienced was, like, a bullying market. And then in May, like, a bunch of people got wrecked and a bunch of people left crypto. Like, my. If you look at my channel metrics, like, I had, like, literally, like, the. My viewership looks like the price of eth.
00:05:15.316 - 00:05:45.404, Speaker A: Like, back in, like, may, everyone was, like, watching my videos. And then after it dumps, like, people just, like, left. But obviously, in hindsight, like, the people that stuck around, the people that bought the dip has a lot more to gain. And I feel like, you know, that's like, a good mindset to have in crypto. So let's move over to cosmos a little bit more because I guess my channel, I cover Terra a lot, right? I feel like a lot of lunatics are subscribed to this channel. And I'm also a lunatic. Like, I'm super bullish Luna.
00:05:45.404 - 00:06:15.670, Speaker A: And I feel like people don't actually know that Terra is actually built on the Cosmos SDK. So the initial question I had is, like, right now, I think tarot is like the number eleven coin on coingecko, and Cosmos is, like, roughly number 20. And I was wondering, if Terra is built on the cosmos SDK, does it make sense that Terra has a higher market cap than cosmos? So what are your thoughts on that question there? And if I'm thinking about this correctly.
00:06:16.650 - 00:07:31.454, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the thing. And that's also, I think for a couple of years that cosmonauts have been complaining about is because there's no kind of, like, value accrual of atom that would rise with the kind of, like adoption or increased adoption of cosmos technology, right? So it's kind of, like, detached from each other up until now. We can talk about this in a bit. But that's why you see, Terra blew up. And it doesn't affect the atom price, even though it's built on the same technology stack, right? And I think in the beginning, like, the whole vision of Cosmos, I think it took me also a while to understand, is basically to build the real open Internet of blockchains, right? Which is permissionless, and it's not around one single, kind of like one single winner, one single coin or chain that rules all the other chains, right? So what you see, for example, a great analogy would be on Polkadot, right? All the parachains in Polkadot, they kind of, like, depend on the relay chain, right? It's packed to it. They borrow the security from the relay chain and Polkadot, and they're fully dependent on it. In cosmos, you have the exact opposite.
00:07:31.454 - 00:08:41.694, Speaker B: Right? All chains that are built on Cosmos, even though they implement IBC, which is what happens in Terra right now, they are not dependent on the cosmos hub. Right. If the cosmos hub went down, which is where atom is built, that's the name of the chain, the cosmos hub, it wouldn't affect Terra. So that's something that took me a bit to understand also. And that's also why you see Terra is bigger than atom in terms of market cap. Now, what's going to come, though, and that's already on the governance dashboard, you can see that there's been two proposals. The first one that I'm personally very, very excited about is interchange security, which would enable something like what the relation for Polkadot is, would enable that for Cosmos, so that the Cosmos hub could optionally be a source of security for other chains that don't want to set up their own validator network, right? Because right now, you see all Cosmos chains, they have their own validators, right? Like Terra, they have their own validators and osmosis and Juno and all these chains sift chain, right? Cash sentinel.
00:08:41.694 - 00:09:24.774, Speaker B: So in the future, once interchange security comes, it would mean a lot of, like, value accrual for atom, the more chains packed to that. Right. And I'm personally only aware of the Cosmos hub within the cosmos ecosystem being the chain that actually works on that. Right. It's really hard to realize they already been working on this for a couple of months. And I think we'll see the first versions late this year, maybe early next year. But once that comes, it would mean that, as an option, smaller projects or they want to launch or bootstrap their project, they can accelerate their time to market by just borrowing security from the cosmos hub through atoms, as kind of like the security guarantee, which would then be locked up.
00:09:24.774 - 00:10:09.600, Speaker B: Right. So this is something that generates a lot of bypressure and also takes out some atoms of the supply. That's one thing I'm excited about. And the second thing I'm excited about is the upcoming kind of, like, integration of IBC routing through the hub, which basically means the more adoption IBC has, we can go into this in detail later. But the more adoption IBC has as this kind of, like, interoperability protocol, the more kind of, like, value is accrued for atom. So there's a proposal that was passed that's going to be implemented very soon on the hub, which is kind of like an incentive model to increase. Kind of like the utility for IBC through atom.
00:10:09.600 - 00:10:39.248, Speaker B: And that's also something that would mean, you know, the bigger the ecosystem grows, the more value accrual for atom without making it kind of like dependent on atom or cosmos. But, yeah, I think those two things alone could turn atom into a top three, top five coin, in my opinion. I say this is a long time. Like, man, I don't know why atom is not in the top five, or at least in the top ten. Let's start there and then top five, top three. Because interoperability means kind of like the next big thing that needs to. Needs to be resolved.
00:10:39.248 - 00:10:53.248, Speaker B: Right? Because I mean, look at the ethereum gas fees, look at all these, like, issues that we have in daily yield, farming and those kind of things. We don't have trustless bridges to connect all these ecosystem and cosmos aims to fix that. So that's why I'm so bullish and excited about it.
00:10:53.424 - 00:10:57.272, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Top five point. We'll see. Only time will tell. Yeah.
00:10:57.272 - 00:11:14.616, Speaker A: Can, can you actually share your screen and go over the governance proposal that you're talking about? Um, because I think one of the reasons Adam had, uh, like, price appreciation in the past a couple weeks or so, I think it's an. It's in anticipation of this passing. Right. And this. This thing is. Okay. It.
00:11:14.616 - 00:11:23.460, Speaker A: It passed, uh, and it's gonna. I think I read that, like, this actually increases staking rewards for Adam. Right. Or am I mistaken in that or.
00:11:24.040 - 00:11:50.570, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's a whole description on the, the proposal. Everybody can read that. And I'm personally a big fan of participating in those governance actions. There's also one on Terra we can take a look at in a second. But Strangelove Ventures, which is basically, they're also running a validator, super active, contributing to the cosmos ecosystem. If you have atom, please delegate to them.
00:11:50.570 - 00:12:58.212, Speaker B: They're really, really active and doing a lot of innovative stuff here. But what they built is an IBC middleware that will allow the hub to play the role of IBC router that was always in vision for it. Passing this proposal would begin a new era of the hub, offering interchange services to other chains and profiting from those relations. And here it goes further in detail, that fees that will be accrued through IBC traffic will be distributed to holders or staked holders, so people that stake atoms. So this is something that kind of, like, gives a lot of value accrual for atom and for atom stakers especially. And I think once this goes live, it's going to take a while when it gets implemented, how to find a perfect fee model and fee structure so that it's still kind of like performing and it's still kind of, like, efficient enough. But I think once we find, you know, a sweet spot and a balance of, in the long run, this could be a real, real game changer for the cosmos.
00:12:58.212 - 00:13:00.520, Speaker B: Hub as a chain and atom as a coin.
00:13:01.180 - 00:13:32.580, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Because I feel like when I first heard about Atom last year, I was doing research, and a lot of the sources, whatever videos or articles I was reading said, yeah, it's great, but there's no value accrual to the token. But I think people have complained about that and it's slowly being changed. So speaking of staking atom, can you just go over, like, the airdrops? Because I watch your channel and you kind of go over a bunch of airdrops. That's going to happen to cosmos stickers.
00:13:33.240 - 00:14:19.656, Speaker B: Let me add one thing before we go to that. What you said, I had Ethan Bachmann, who is one of the two original co founders of Tendermint, or Cosmos, as a project. But tendermint is the consensus algorithm that is kind of like powering all of that. Ethan told me on my interview with him that when they launched, or when they started in whatever, 2014, 2015. Jay Kwan, the Ardiv co founder, he's been working on this in 2013, 2014, like absolute OG. But when they worked on this in the beginning, they focused on building tendermint as the consensus algorithm, proof of stake based back in the days where proof of stake was absolutely delusional. Right? Bitcoin people, they were like, man, this is never going to work.
00:14:19.656 - 00:14:44.070, Speaker B: This is never going to be decentralized in those kind of things. So they focused on tendermint shipped. It works. Then they focused also on the Cosmos SDK as this kind of, like, developer kit that new chains could be launched easily without a lot of hassle. So they ship. That also works. Then they focus on IBC as this interoperability protocol.
00:14:44.070 - 00:15:14.108, Speaker B: And that was only shipped earlier this year. So that's only shipped in April, I think. So that's the third one. And then he said also in the video that, well, now might actually be the time where we can say, okay, now let's focus on the game theory. Let's focus on kind of like the value accrual and circulating demand for atoms and also incentive structures and those kind of things. We're talking about also liquid staking that's going to come. We talk about interchange security, which I talked about earlier and also IBC routing.
00:15:14.108 - 00:15:56.974, Speaker B: There's so many things that are right now, literally in the last two months, I guess two, three, four months since IBC shipped that got launched and are now in the works and about to launch. And by the way, I forgot also to mention this earlier. We also just saw the launch of Gravity Dex, which is the native Dex on top of the cosmos hub chain. And that's also kind of like settled in atoms. Right? So that also means kind of like increased utility and demand for atom. And it is accessible through emirates.com. so that's a Defi dashboard where people can, for now, get access to the gravity Dex.
00:15:56.974 - 00:16:06.206, Speaker B: In the future, we'll see more and more chains connected to it, more DeFi protocols. But yeah, you were asking about the airdrops.
00:16:06.278 - 00:16:10.790, Speaker A: Yeah, people love airdrops. People love airdrops.
00:16:11.450 - 00:16:13.186, Speaker B: Yeah, we all love airdrops.
00:16:13.338 - 00:16:14.002, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:14.146 - 00:16:52.436, Speaker B: Uniswap one was kind of like the birth of crypto airdrop season, and now more and more chains are replicating that. So I can recommend everybody to go follow this account, Cosmos Airdrops. Cosmos underscore airdrops. Actually got credit today. And yeah, this account keeps track of all upcoming airdrops. So here in the pinch, you can see already a nice screenshot of upcoming airdrops. The Chuno chain, which just went live, had a snapshot on February, I think it was actually February 18, which was for Atom Stakers.
00:16:52.436 - 00:17:09.316, Speaker B: Ethermint, which is now called fmos, has a snapshot that is still in the future. So that's coming. That's going to be really, really, really big. I recommend everybody to check this project out. Then Sputnik. I don't even know too much about them. Gno Gnoland.
00:17:09.316 - 00:17:48.270, Speaker B: That's a project from Jake won, the original co founder of Cosmos, or an inventor of tendermint. He just said a couple of weeks ago, hey, I'm working on a smart contract platform and there will be an airdrop or stake drop, I think both airdrop and stake drop for atom holders and stakers. So this one is what I'm really, really excited about, the sunny airdrop. I think already the snapshot already happened. This one was for Osmo holders and Osmo liquidity providers. Cosmos Gaming Hub announced airdrop. That's gaming kind of like hub on top of the Cosmos technology stack.
00:17:48.270 - 00:18:10.450, Speaker B: That's also going to come, then a Citadel airdrop. But this one is only if you delegate it to their node and it just goes on. I mean, we can go through this. Like there's, I think he made a thread about it. There's some other projects that are coming now, I think. Yeah, I think this is just the first kind of like, couple of airdrops. But I also made a video about this.
00:18:10.450 - 00:18:32.832, Speaker B: Two videos, actually. Sommelier is coming up. Omniflix is coming up. Bitsong is coming up. So many projects, it's really hard to even keep track of. But, yeah, I'm extremely, I think that's also some use case that people maybe underestimate is like, just getting those airdrops, you know, like on terra. Big use case for Luna is you just get constantly these airdrops.
00:18:32.832 - 00:18:33.016, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:33.048 - 00:18:36.448, Speaker A: Yeah. All the time. All the time, yeah.
00:18:36.464 - 00:18:53.858, Speaker B: And I also hold Luna since, I don't know, a long time already. And it's crazy how much free money you get just for holding it or staking it. Right. So, yeah, that's something I recommend everyone to, to check out. Cosmos airdrops. Cosmos airdrops.
00:18:54.034 - 00:19:22.710, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess this is the alpha, this Twitter account that Cosmos airdrops. It's funny you mentioned Luna and, like, I guess because I guess when people value stocks, they do like, a dollar, like a discounted cash flow model, like how much this company can return to shareholders over time and whatnot. But similarly with airdrops, maybe someone can do like, a discounted cash flow model of, okay, like these. These are all the airdrops coming into the near future. And, like, it's actually, like, gives Adam or Luna a premium.
00:19:23.890 - 00:19:24.178, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:24.194 - 00:19:25.590, Speaker A: And I think it's something to consider.
00:19:25.970 - 00:19:54.170, Speaker B: It's also another use case for atom. Right. A lot of people ask me, okay, what's the use case? Right? But, man, if, if you want. So an airdrop is not because these projects want to gift you money and want to make you rich, right? That's not why people give out airdrops. Airdrop is basically the perfect user acquisition strategy. So. And I think, my thought is, my guess is that over the next couple of months, we are going to see much more refined and targeted airdrops.
00:19:54.170 - 00:19:58.342, Speaker B: One of them, this is the absolute Alpha league now.
00:19:58.526 - 00:19:59.650, Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
00:20:00.070 - 00:20:43.132, Speaker B: There's a project called Cyber, and they're also going to be at our conference and launch their main ad during the conference. These guys have an airdrop of 70% of the total supply that gets distributed to different tiers of crypto users. And they have very, very detailed requirements who they want to give these tokens to. One of them, for example, is you must be an Ethereum user. So you have to have a metamask wallet or whatever. EtH wallethood and you cannot have more than 50% in stablecoins. Right? So they're like, fuck, stable coins.
00:20:43.132 - 00:21:11.542, Speaker B: We don't want people that have stable coins. We only want to target people that are actually active and have made so and so many transactions over the past couple of months. So I think we're going to see a lot more refined airdrops in the future. So cyber is one of them there. I've never seen something like that. I saw the, on the GitHub, actually, their methodology, who gets this airdrop? And it's so detailed. And they do that because they want to onboard users, and they know what users they want.
00:21:11.542 - 00:21:36.488, Speaker B: So airdrops are the perfect way to get to users quickly. We've seen it with all these terra protocols on top, like anchor and mirror. They don't have many users just like that. They also have it because of these airdrops. People get these tokens for free and then they start using the product. So I think people are underestimating, and I think it's a great use case.
00:21:36.664 - 00:22:38.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think late last year or earlier this year, I think one inch did an airdrop to anyone that used Uniswap a few times or something, it's like, okay, you've demonstrated that you want to swap on Uniswap, but hey, we'll give you tokens to these people that swapped. So, like, why not try out our platform, stuff like that? And I think when it comes to Terra, I think the Nexus protocol, I think they're going to airdrop their tokens to people that stake anchor, because they want to target people. That is bullish anchor, which makes sense. And I'm sure with cyber and these, I guess, protocols, they're going to do these targeted airdrops, like you said, for marketing, customer acquisition, and for awareness reasons, uh, because the biggest advocates for your project is going to be the early users, et cetera. So speaking of Terra, I think there was a proposal out today, actually, by do Kwon about, like, bringing ust right to Cosmos. I know you have a, like a.
00:22:39.270 - 00:22:39.830, Speaker B: You can.
00:22:39.910 - 00:22:48.730, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you just do that again? So can you, like, kind of go over, like, the importance of this and the significance of, like, what this means for Cosmos and for, I guess, Terra too.
00:22:49.410 - 00:22:53.190, Speaker B: So first of all, though, if you're watching this, you're not following me. You have to fix that.
00:22:53.490 - 00:22:55.470, Speaker A: He's not following me either. This guy.
00:22:57.410 - 00:23:19.484, Speaker B: We got to fix that. We've got to work on that. But, yeah, so this proposal came from. I think it came from someone, like, from the community or some project. But do put this out. Actually, this morning, 07:30 a.m. here in Portugal, proposal 128 is to enable IBC transfers, and there's no life for voting, so that's really, really cool.
00:23:19.484 - 00:24:00.758, Speaker B: And he's also tagging like Cosmos hub, osmosis zone band, Cryptocom, they're all like Cosmos chains. And IBC basically means that Luna and all terra assets become compatible with all Cosmos dexs and also all Cosmos wallets, like Kepler and Cosmo station. Right? Which makes it really, really friendly because you can keep all at one place. So from a user friendly aspect, that's really cool. And the proposal is here on the terra station, 100% voted for yes. Like 0% no, just 35. Luna that abstained, I don't know why, passed over your threshold, 44% voted for yes.
00:24:00.758 - 00:24:50.710, Speaker B: So this thing is going to go through. This is actually the depositor. I don't even know who that is. But yeah, this thing went through or is about to go through, basically. And so what it means is, basically, like I said, this means that Luna, this means that ust super important and anchor mirror, all these coins are going to be compatible with Cosmos dexs, right? And that's a big deal because currently the biggest Cosmos Dex and the most fun Cosmos Dex, in my opinion, is osmosis, right? And osmosis, they have, let me close it, of Moses. What they have, they have like 15 or 16 coins right now, all cosmos coins. One of them is actually already a stable coin, the euro, by the e money team.
00:24:50.710 - 00:25:42.454, Speaker B: And I think they get way too little credit for what they're doing. But once ust comes, it means that you have two stable coins on osmosis, which means that there's going to be potentially even incentivized pools on osmosis with stable coins. And if you look on all the Ethereum defi, all Ethereum amms, the biggest pools are always stablecoins, right? Because you're mitigating the impermanent loss. And if you have incentivized stablecoin pools, I mean, that's just my guess here. But, like, it's kissing goodbye. Like, especially for ust that has so many users, so much liquidity, so much hype, so much buzz, and it actually works. One of the largest algorithmic stable coins out there, then I think this is going to drag in a lot of users, but also a lot of smart and weighted money, right? People that just want to park their stable coins and they say, hey, I want to hold self custody, number one.
00:25:42.454 - 00:26:14.934, Speaker B: And number two, I want to earn yields higher than at the bank or just leaving it in whatever my metamask account. So if you can split it up in UST and maybe euro and you're incentivized through Osmo, that's a big thing. That's a big deal. So I'm really excited for that. The whole cosmos community is, and I think so is the whole terra community, because I think Cosmo has made really. Really. Yeah, they have done a really.
00:26:14.934 - 00:26:22.244, Speaker B: They have a very successful platform there. And we can also look into some numbers. Actually, let me share that one as well.
00:26:22.382 - 00:26:42.136, Speaker A: Yeah. And can you also like, screen share, like, the osmosis farms as well? Because, I mean, I know about them, but like, some, some of my users, some of my viewers may not. And yeah, I totally agree. Like, if UsT can come onto, like, osmosis, like, there's going to be more demand for UST. And what does that mean? Well, Luna gets burned. So. Yeah.
00:26:42.136 - 00:26:43.820, Speaker A: So can you go over this, too?
00:26:44.680 - 00:27:00.692, Speaker B: Yeah, so, like, exactly. I mean, the more demand is, it's a kind of like win win situation. Because the more demand for, the more Luna gets burned. Right. As more UST get minted. So that's really, really interesting. And here on my favorite site, mapofzones.com,
00:27:00.692 - 00:27:22.620, Speaker B: you can actually see all the IBC activity. I think I gotta refresh that IBC activity. And all these chains that are currently connected to it. Currently we have 16. They call it zones, but zones are basically chains. And Terra is already there. Terra is already there, but there's no channels yet.
00:27:22.620 - 00:28:02.090, Speaker B: So all these arrows here, you see our IBC channels. But once this upgrade goes live, in a week or two or three, I don't know when it gets. I don't know how Terra governance functions under the hood, but it's going to be weeks. Like in a couple of weeks, Terra will have channels to all these other trains. And then you can transact your UST, your luna, your whatever, onto these other chains and vice versa. Like we said earlier, the osmosis, the Cosmos hub, they have combined more than 110, 120,000 monthly active users, monthly on chain active users in the last 30 days. That's a big thing.
00:28:02.090 - 00:28:30.350, Speaker B: That's a big deal. Terra is new here, so these numbers are just getting bootstrapped. But you see all these other chains, they have a lot of active users and also the transaction volume and also IBC transfers. Right? Like this is all growing. So that's really interesting. I think that's also the first site. I recommend everyone who wants to keep track of the latest IBC implementations and the latest stats here.
00:28:30.350 - 00:29:05.346, Speaker B: Mapofzones.com another site that I recommend is Mintscan IO. This is from the Cosmo station wallet team. And here you can also see if you click on IBC relayers. Actually, you can see now we're on the Cosmos hub chain. And those are all the channels that are packed to the Cosmos hub through IBC. And you can even see here, okay, how many channels are currently open since when, how many transactions in the last 24 hours and how much value? Right, half a mil almost here on a cash channel, you can just play around with that.
00:29:05.346 - 00:29:31.566, Speaker B: I guess osmosis should be big. 113.5 million once Terra gets there. Man, I think this is going to be even bigger than osmosis. There's going to be so much value transfer between those chains. I think do Kwan is equally excited as we all are and the whole terra crew and whole lunatic community. The top two sites I can recommend everyone who really wants to stay up to date with on chain stuff.
00:29:31.566 - 00:29:58.660, Speaker B: And this is like really, you know, you can like, it's very visualized, it's easy to understand, and there's other things you can play around with here. It's just an explorer, basically, where you can see on chain, on chain analytics. But I think it's really cool, especially because IBC's is a different thing than just analyzing, you know, where is tokens going? It's more like, how do we build these bridges and connections to other chains? And I think that's a interesting part here.
00:29:59.640 - 00:30:12.744, Speaker A: Yeah. And hey, if you're a lunatic, then, you know, more utility for USD. We're all happy about that. Okay, awesome. Yeah. So I guess going over to, like, the farms, right?
00:30:12.912 - 00:30:13.672, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:13.856 - 00:30:29.232, Speaker A: So I think there's osmosis, there's persistence. Right? And you mentioned the gravity Dex earlier. So can you just like, go over a few farms that you're super excited about, like right now? And I guess kind of just like go over, I guess, the websites and.
00:30:29.256 - 00:31:14.754, Speaker B: Apps maybe the first before I share my screen. So there's right now a couple of amms that are really, really exciting that I'm personally also farming. In fact, I'm right now, I'm spending way too much time right now with videos and research and like, my Cosmos conference. I should just be 24/7 farming and, you know, like doing bull run things. But still, I try to be up to date with all the latest and osmosis. Actually, when I got into Cosmos earlier this year, the Osmosis Twitter account was created right a week after I first heard about and really dig into Cosmos. So I was aware of this very early on.
00:31:14.754 - 00:32:02.008, Speaker B: And then they announced an airdrop, or basically teased an airdrop back then already in February, and it launched on June 19. So in that period I didn't really know what this is, what's going to happen, but it launched and it launched with a bang. I mean, the incentives in the beginning when they added incentivized pools like late June were absolutely insane. I mean it started I think with 4000% apyethere or APR, not even APY, but yeah. And it's still, since then has evolved a lot like I showed earlier, 40,000 almost monthly active users. And that's how it looks like. And in fact it's a basic kind of like very intuitive amm.
00:32:02.008 - 00:32:44.530, Speaker B: You can trade your coins here. It connects through Kepler wallet, by the way. So you must have had Kepler installed or it's a browser extension, mobile wallet coming soon. But yeah, you get Kepler, you connect it here and boom, you can trade all these coins to each other. And the interesting part here is all these coins are basically sovereign blockchains, right? So once Luna implements IBC, you will also be able to trade Luna for OSmO or whatever and back and forth and UST and all these coins. If we look at the pools here, you see the incentivized pools. This is probably just my demo account, but liquidity is pretty good.
00:32:44.530 - 00:33:08.358, Speaker B: Atom Osmo 200 million plus liquidity, 64% Apr. So this still a lot, right? I mean, and this thing is liquid. This thing is liquid. Osmo itself is very liquid. Just entered the top hundred a few days ago. I think it's around 100. So it's not even like a micro nano cap coin.
00:33:08.358 - 00:33:16.100, Speaker B: Right? This is a big, I think it's, it's a bill. Is it a billion already? Let's see, Osmo 107.
00:33:17.360 - 00:33:20.984, Speaker A: Oh, right there, one bill, 5.2.
00:33:21.032 - 00:34:04.548, Speaker B: Yeah, it's exactly at a billion, exactly at a billion circulating supply. Circulating market cap. So yeah, Osmo is a very, very liquid coin and you can farm it here with those crazy APy APRs, 220% in the sentinel pool. My favorite pool right now is where is it here, the XPRt pool, because well, for one, the APR is high, 172% is still good. But I also know that once it drops below a certain threshold, they're going to add XPRT incentives on top of that. So you have a dual farming. So that's really cool.
00:34:04.548 - 00:34:25.428, Speaker B: So that's already confirmed from the team. I guess they're just waiting for these rewards to kind of like, cool a little bit down and then they can add more incentives on top. But yeah, it's pretty intuitive. You can provide liquidity here. Very simple user experience here. Bam, you provide a liquidity, then you choose. This is what a lot of people always get wrong.
00:34:25.428 - 00:35:00.120, Speaker B: It's like they ask me like, oh, do I have to do something after a day? After seven days? After 14 days. Because you have to choose your unbonding. But it basically means once you bond your lp tokens and if you decided to, I want to withdraw them, I want to dump Osmo, I want to change to another pool. This is like the unbonding period. So you choose that upfront. And the longer you choose, obviously the higher the APR, but it's just kind of like decreasing the velocity of those coins so that you can't insta dump. And that's why the high RPR.
00:35:00.120 - 00:35:37.438, Speaker B: That doesn't mean that after 14 days, you have to do something. It rather means if you want to withdraw your liquidity, you have to wait 14 days. But during those 14 days, you're still earning this ApR. So that's why I'm all in 14 days. 14 days. I also really believe Osmo has very strong value propositions, and that's why I'm really bullish on that. And, I mean, there's more, like, on osmosis governance, there's also a lot of, like, proposals that went through to add incentivized pools for, you know, for euro, for Juno even.
00:35:37.438 - 00:35:44.966, Speaker B: Like, that's all coming. And I think there's still a lot more that we can explore and expect here from. From osmo.
00:35:45.078 - 00:36:20.312, Speaker A: Yeah. And as a farmer, the one thing that, okay, so in the past couple of months, everyone's like, yo, like, you talk about osmosis. Um, and the reason I didn't farm was because, like, whenever I provide liquidity, um, usually I don't like providing liquidity for like, two volatile asset pairs, right? Uh, if it's like bitcoin or eth pair, that's like, fine, right? Because it's less volatile. But if I'm, for example, if I. If you go down, there's like a cosh osmo, right? Just like two volatile pairs. I don't want to deal with impermanent loss. Uh, so that, that's one of the reasons I wasn't really farming this, even though I knew about it.
00:36:20.312 - 00:36:57.820, Speaker A: Uh, and the importance of UsT coming on is that, hey, if I can provide liquidity for atom, USD, Osmo, UST, akash, UST persistence, USD, it just makes, I guess, the future growth of my liquidity pool pair more predictable, which makes it more attractive for me. So I think having UST is going to be huge for osmo. I think it's going to boost the TVL a lot. Um, and, yeah, I mean, that, that, that's, like, my way of, like, clarifying, like, why I haven't been farming this. But hey, like, anyone that's like, farm this, like, you're up a lot of money, so congratulations to you.
00:36:58.720 - 00:37:35.740, Speaker B: I think one thing to that is also, like, if I was not aware of what all these coins are, right, like, expertise is persistence. DVPN, sentinel. But I know, like, the teams I've been in talks with them for a long time. I understand, like, the dynamics behind, but if you just see those coin tickets tickers and you've never seen them before, you're like, man, what shitcoin? What low cap shitcoin is that? And you're, like, not in that ecosystem. I don't really know about this. So I understand that people are still kind of, like, hesitant to get into those pools because they don't know these coins. They don't know the underlying kind of, like, value of value proposition of these coins.
00:37:35.740 - 00:37:45.210, Speaker B: I think that's totally fine. But once we see major coins coming in, like you said, ust and Luna, you know, people are like, okay, maybe this is actually legit and you start to use it.
00:37:45.510 - 00:38:13.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like if there's, like, a luna atom pool or like a. I don't know, that'll be a pretty cool one. I might dabble in there. I know you had a tab open for persistence. I think persistence is interesting. The idea of liquid staking, I think, is a huge idea. So can you kind of go over, like, I think you and Liam, another youtuber, is gigabullous persistence.
00:38:13.620 - 00:38:17.080, Speaker A: So can you go over why you're so excited about persistence?
00:38:17.780 - 00:39:18.550, Speaker B: Yeah, so, persistence, I think they have very also close ties and good connections to the terra team, and I see a lot of similarities, as in they want to build money markets both in their own ways, but persistence, they kind of, like, started first with this, with this approach to build liquid staking for Cosmos coins. Right. And the first one was atom. So what you can do right now, I can actually also share my screen for that is you can go over on pstake finance. That's the kind of, like, website or web app where you can get involved, and you actually can do two things here. So the first thing that you can do, you bridge your atom over to ethereum. And the second thing you do is you have a staked representation of your, sorry, a representation of your staked atoms that you can then use in ethereum defi.
00:39:18.550 - 00:39:37.458, Speaker B: So there's like those two steps here is one, the bridging, and two, like the liquefying of staked assets. Atom is the first one. It's a very also simple, intuitive platform. I think I opened it here, actually. You connect your metamask wallet to it. Boom, you're here. And then also your Kepler.
00:39:37.458 - 00:40:22.240, Speaker B: You stake your Kepler, you wrap your atom first into P atom, then they're on the ethereum chain, and then you flip it to stake atom. Basically, you're staking it now, but it's still a liquid coin that you can then use in sushiswap. There's a pool now on Sushiswap, the ethnic eth SDK atom pool. And they already announced that there's going to be retroactive rewards for early LP's. So what I did when it came out, I just aped into that pool because, like, man, why not? You know, why not? You have to be early with those things such as, you know, osmosis. I into osmosis on day one when it came out and was a good decision. Same on peesteak.
00:40:22.240 - 00:41:19.652, Speaker B: And they actually also launched their own coin, another coin called pstake. And I guess that's going to be the kind of like incentive game, theoretic incentive that you can farm on these ethereum pools. Sushiswap is now the first one. I guess they're going to add more, and then also they're going to add more coins that you can get back onto Ethereum, like xperity and whatever, all the other cosmos assets. But I think that's really interesting because we, I mean, Ethereum is still like the biggest defi ecosystem in the world, right? It still has the deepest liquidity, the most users, the most bus, the most dapps. And I think just like bridging over staked atoms onto Ethereum could potentially mean, you know, to drag more eyeballs onto that coin, onto cosmos, to get them back into cosmos. And I think that's a good user acquisition strategy.
00:41:19.652 - 00:41:46.314, Speaker B: We still have to wait and see how that turns out. I mean, till now, that's just like, you know, theory. But I think the rollout over the past couple of weeks has gone really, really, really well. And, yeah, I mean, you can earn 7% APR just by holding SDK atom, which goes up in value against p atom. And then you can use that SDK, atom in the Ethereum defi, and you can earn additional yields. Right? So that's pretty cool. You earn double the yields.
00:41:46.482 - 00:42:11.060, Speaker A: Yeah. I love these liquid derivative, like, staked tokens. It's like lido has be stuff like that. And I know anchor wants to add, like, more, I guess, like there's be Luna, there's be. They want to add b soul, be Adam, like, you know, there's more utility that creates more demand. Right. If you can use it as collateral.
00:42:11.060 - 00:42:13.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I just love these things.
00:42:14.600 - 00:43:20.110, Speaker B: So in that context, and this is another alpha league, I think, osmosis, right? So Sunny Agarwal is one of the co founders of osmosis. He's an absolute cosmologist, Og, absolute legend already. Very young guy, but really, really, really smart. And he announced, or basically osmosis team announced, that osmosis is going to bring something that's called superfluid staking. And superfluid staking is basically the exact opposite to liquid staking, because in superfluid staking, you're not tokenizing staked assets. Instead, you just allow the protocol to accept different kind of, like, assets or different kind of, like, form of collateral to be deposited. So, for example, imagine right now, if I want to secure the cosmos hub chain, the only coin it accepts is atom, right? I can't deposit Akash Akt coins to or some LP token to kind of like security cosmos chain.
00:43:20.110 - 00:43:56.950, Speaker B: But what superfluid staking envisions to do is that you can now deposit LP tokens that earn yield for you because it's liquidity. Right. And you can deposit that to provide security for a chain, which means you also earn staking rewards on top of that. So it's kind of like the reverse way of liquid staking. And that's something that's coming with osmosis first. They have kind of, like invented or pioneered that concept and really, really excited to see that play out in reality. And, yeah, I don't know if there's a timeline for it yet, but I think I probably we're going to see this year still.
00:43:56.950 - 00:43:58.810, Speaker B: So that's going to be really, really cool.
00:44:00.310 - 00:44:30.406, Speaker A: That's really cool. Yeah. Thanks for all the alpha leaks. You're definitely more, I guess, connected to the ecosystem much more than I am. So I appreciate all the alpha and acknowledge you're dropping on us. So we talked about a lot of, I guess, catalysts coming up, I guess with the new governance proposal, like USD coming, et cetera. I guess looking out into the future, what are you most excited about in the cosmos ecosystem.
00:44:30.406 - 00:44:37.010, Speaker A: And if you want to follow up with that, with any other forms that you're interested in, feel free to do that as well.
00:44:37.590 - 00:44:41.062, Speaker B: No, I mean, I can share maybe two more farms.
00:44:41.086 - 00:44:42.510, Speaker A: Okay, let's do that first.
00:44:42.550 - 00:45:14.600, Speaker B: Then things one is already teased earlier is Amyris, and they are the potentially going to add another token to it or some sort of like, incentive. So I just encourage everyone here to get aware of this and, you know, to be aware of this and check this out and see and maybe, you know, play around with it a little bit. Maybe there's going to be an airdrop in the future. Nothing has been, like, finalized yet, but I think there is something in the works. It's just my personal gut feeling and guess. And another one. Actually, I wanted to share this one as well.
00:45:14.600 - 00:45:20.358, Speaker B: That's another alpha leak. And cosmonaut is going to roast me for that. But that's sift chain.
00:45:20.454 - 00:45:24.606, Speaker A: It's my alpha leak, too. I love siftchain. I don't own any, though.
00:45:24.678 - 00:45:56.740, Speaker B: But, yeah, no sif chain. What they did, the text is already live for a couple of weeks, by the way, you have to read the disclaimers, I think us people are not allowed to use that. I don't know, but whatever. It's a bit. We're decentralized, aren't we? But anyway, in this sift chain, Dex, which launched already a couple of weeks ago, they added. Just a few days ago, I think two days ago they added what's called. Where is it? They added the.
00:45:56.740 - 00:46:12.666, Speaker B: Oh, here. I think it's in rewards. The Sifs harvest. Exactly. Sif harvest, which is a reward program that pays a lot of Rovan, which is a native coin of siftchain to LP's. Right. So in that way.
00:46:12.666 - 00:46:17.310, Speaker B: And it completely blew up over the past few days since it launched two days ago.
00:46:17.690 - 00:46:22.030, Speaker A: 50 million tbo, it says bottom left. That's pretty. That's really impressive.
00:46:22.530 - 00:46:39.550, Speaker B: Yeah, that went really quick. And, yeah, I mean, it's a Dex, first of all. But the difference to osmosis is here. That sift chain natively implements a bridge to Ethereum. So you can actually, you know, provide liquidity for atom and one inch. Right. Or Roman.
00:46:39.550 - 00:47:01.614, Speaker B: And what do we have? Dai. Right, that's cool. Now you have Ethereum and Cosmos merged on one platform. And the APIs for that are pretty compelling. 500% yesterday, I think, was still a thousand. Now it dropped a little bit. And Juno, this pool is completely crazy.
00:47:01.614 - 00:47:15.080, Speaker B: 776 at 67%. So check out these pools. I mean, it always makes sense to be early with those things and just grab some good, good deals here on the farms and good ip wise.
00:47:15.780 - 00:47:20.556, Speaker A: Oh, man, I should be farming this right now. Oh, my God.
00:47:20.708 - 00:47:42.606, Speaker B: I want to. I want to go, like, I'm already farming it, but I want to, like, I want to go in really heavy on this, but it's just like, I mean, you have to, like, take a couple of hours to, like, really dig deep and understand everything before you go in with a lot of money. But I think I really want to do this. I've been in touch with the team for quite some time now. I had Jazeera on my channel, the.
00:47:42.718 - 00:47:45.118, Speaker A: Kind of like, yeah, yeah, he's a.
00:47:45.134 - 00:47:48.550, Speaker B: Team member, but I think he's actually the founder and.
00:47:48.710 - 00:48:23.626, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, so for people that was kind of confused, I think the best way to think about it is, like, thor chain, right? Think about Thor chain. Thor chain, I think can, like, swap between, like, ETH and, like, native ETH and native bitcoin, right? Like, going through the Thor chain ecosystem. ETH is traded towards Thor chain, the ruin token, and then ruin is traded to bitcoin. Right. And you don't have to, like, wrap things. You don't have to, like, wrap the wrap things to, like, make it like ERC 20 tokens, but with sift chain, I think they're creating a Dex for, like, the longer tail assets. Right.
00:48:23.626 - 00:49:06.060, Speaker A: So we talked about there's other tokens, like ERC 20 that I haven't heard about, but there's liquidity for it. So. Yeah, I've heard about sift chain for a while now. When I first did research earlier this year, it was like, I'm in the US. I was blocked. I'm like, okay, I'm not going to worry about this, but I know recently there's been lots of developments, and I think Jazeer, he was also part of Thor chain, right? So I think, yeah, so, like, you know, he definitely understands, like, how to build out this technology. And obviously, door chains have been hacked a few times or exploited a few times, so maybe sift chain is like a good hedge.
00:49:06.060 - 00:49:20.228, Speaker A: I don't own any right now. Maybe I should be farming, but, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's. That's kind of how I feel. Yeah, it was like $0.45. That's pretty high. It's behind. It's crazy.
00:49:20.284 - 00:49:49.266, Speaker B: Yeah. But the thing is also, like, you're super deep in terra and that's amazing. And you can't catch them. All, right. Like, it's like, sure. Right now, sift chain might be, you know, the hottest thing, but if you just stick to, like, your terra, you know, farms, I think, or whatever, you also other networks that you're farming on. I think if you spread yourself too thin in the end of the day, it's also going to be kind of like, you know, because you're not able to be up to date with all chains at the same time.
00:49:49.266 - 00:50:15.520, Speaker B: With all farms at the same time. Right. It's kind of like a full time job already. And the more you add, the more complex it gets. But, yeah, I think, you know, it still makes sense sometimes to, like, be aware that these things exist and also be aware of the innovative factor of this. Right. Like, osmosis brought this kind of like, first amm that was truly interoperable with sovereign chains through IBC, took IBC mainstream in the first place.
00:50:15.520 - 00:50:57.464, Speaker B: Now you see siftchain that is kind of like bringing this ethereum compatibility. And earlier you asked me what I'm really excited about, and I think seeing the gravity bridge now in the final phases to go live also on the Cosmos hub would mean that you can natively swap Ethereum assets to cosmos assets on the Cosmos hub chain. Right? So that's something I'm really excited about. Superfluous staking. I'm getting more and more behind it and also how it works and how the impact it could have. Another thing I'm really excited about. And then there's, well, what I talked about in the very beginning, IBC routing interchange security.
00:50:57.464 - 00:51:50.006, Speaker B: Those are like the elephants in the room. Those are like the biggest value accrual factors for atom. Obviously, that's no question. By far the most exciting thing. But if I had to pick another thing, I'm not too deep into that project, but it's called Axelr, and they're building a native, trustless bridge between bitcoin and cosmos, which would potentially mean that they're building a chain that is IBC compatible and transfers bitcoin back and forth, which would decongest bitcoin and make it much more usable. And I remember in the earlier days when I joined Cosmos, I had a call with Sunny Agarwal and I asked him how he got into crypto in cosmos. And he said, man, my first vision was to maximize the value of bitcoin.
00:51:50.006 - 00:52:17.380, Speaker B: So I'm actually a bitcoin maximalist in that sense. Not as intoxic, but as in, I want to maximize the value of this. So he saw Cosmos as kind of like the ultimate project to maximize the value of bitcoin. And make it interoperable and fast and scalable through tenement and add smart contract features to it. And I think Axela could potentially be one of the projects that could actually realize that. So that's one thing I'm really excited about as well. And.
00:52:17.380 - 00:52:22.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think I mentioned already a lot of things, so I'm really excited about many things.
00:52:23.290 - 00:52:46.146, Speaker A: Yeah. And I often talk about like, in crypto, you have to build conviction, right. It's just like. Because I feel like if you're in crypto, you're in it for like those, like those multiples, right? Those gains. And obviously, like, you know, if a coin, ten X's, right, you look back on it and be like, wow, like, these people got so lucky. It's like easy ten X. But if you like, zoom in, it's like the ten X was like super volatile.
00:52:46.146 - 00:53:15.080, Speaker A: Right. And in order for you to hold through that, you just have to have conviction. So I really applaud you for just building conviction. Maybe you should rebrand to apeseto, given how hard you're aping into some things. In terms of me, I think what I'm most excited about is, for sure, USD, USD, utility, of course. And I watched your video on this, umi. Oh God, I.
00:53:15.080 - 00:53:35.772, Speaker A: Right, yeah. Umi, it's a money market. I don't know why he wrote it on a postcard, post it note, but it's a money market. I really recommend everyone watch crypto, Cedaw's or ape Cedos video on Umi. He has a video with like, I think, I think the co founder. It's a, it's a money market. Anyone that follows me knows that.
00:53:35.772 - 00:54:07.490, Speaker A: Like, I love money markets. Whenever a trusted, reliable money market with incentives come online, I just ape. That's kind of how I operate. So make sure to check out his video. And speaking of which. Yeah, I just want to thank you for coming on, educating me about Cosmos and what's coming up. So for anyone that want to follow you, follow up on your content, et cetera, can you go over your YouTube channel, your Twitter account, etcetera, and see where people can find you?
00:54:09.240 - 00:54:44.844, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. Thank you so much for having me on. Really appreciate also the kind words. This was really fun. And I mean, I don't like, usually I don't talk too much about my kind of like my latest farms and this and that, slowly more and more, because I think people with the right mindset, with the right kind of like risk adversity, I don't want people to fomo into things they don't truly, like, care to understand. I, in the first place, care for people to understand and do their research, but at the same time, also, no man like this sometimes can be like life changing for people.
00:54:44.844 - 00:55:22.306, Speaker B: You know, in osmosis, for example, I have a friend and he told about osmosis to friends in Lebanon, and they're making an extra 20, $30 a day, which is life changing for them. So I think I kind of like, want to get the word out, but without creating too much fomo and hype. And I think that's why I like making more kind of tutorials, like today. I think this is probably super valuable for people to also see where to click, how it looks like, what to do, where to look at things. So I think, yeah, that's really cool. Really appreciate what you do as well. Hope to have you on my channel one time as well.
00:55:22.306 - 00:55:24.110, Speaker B: And yeah, thanks for having me on.
00:55:25.730 - 00:55:44.654, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Yeah, so make sure I'll provide a link to, in the description below to your Twitter and your YouTube. So make sure to subscribe to him. Uh, you know, like, I kind of, for me, like, I, like, I don't. I cover all sorts of ecosystems, right? And I'm not like an ecosystem, axie. I just like, rotate. Uh, that's kind of my thing.
00:55:44.654 - 00:56:03.762, Speaker A: Um, but for, like, more specific, detailed cosmos content. Like, he is the man for you. I've been subscribed to his channel for a while now. Uh, I think there's another, another guy, Liam. I think he's also good. I think his YouTube is confident in crypto or something like that. I'll link it in the description below.
00:56:03.762 - 00:56:37.106, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think it's useful to not just get all your news and alpha from just one person. Right. I think for me personally, I subscribe to dozens of YouTube channels from people that I trust and I weigh the alpha and the news in my head and then I deploy capital accordingly. So, yeah, definitely subscribe to him. Cryptocido, apesedo and Liam and yeah, thank you guys for watching. Have informing out there and let me know what your thoughts are on the cosmos ecosystem. Thank you.
00:56:37.106 - 00:56:37.210, Speaker A: Bye.
