00:00:00.320 - 00:00:35.386, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tykee here today I like to address the soft rug by poliwhale and what this generally means for defi yield farms and crypto in general. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Alright, so today it was announced that, or I guess it wasn't really announced. Like what, what happened was that poliwhale, the team soft drug. Soft drug means the developers just leave the project, right? Because they just don't want to work on it anymore and etcetera. So, poliwhill, it was actually the first yield farm that I actually participated in because they were the first, right, on Polygon.
00:00:35.386 - 00:00:59.000, Speaker A: And flashback to my April 30 video, and you see that the price of krill is at $152. And this was a pretty good form, actually. I was earning consistently four to 600%. I think it lasted for a few weeks and I made some decent money. But obviously now it's trading at $0.14. So, you know, this is what I always mean by don't marry a farm. Farm tokens usually trend to zero.
00:00:59.000 - 00:01:28.484, Speaker A: They're designed to go to zero. And if you look at the article, the team said they were quitting due to bad tokenomics and poor market conditions. Hmm. A farm with bad tokenomics, who would have thought, right? Who would have thought a farm would have bad tokenomics? And if you actually look at, like, the statement by the team, right, they're like, we quit because tokenomics didn't work out how we planned. Okay. Like, I guess minting infinite amount of tokens doesn't really mean price goes up. Hard to fathom.
00:01:28.484 - 00:01:56.340, Speaker A: Markets took a huge turn to the red side. I didn't even notice this type of red side. Okay, well, yeah, because I always talk about, you know, when the markets are bearish. Right? Like when the market looks gross as it is right now, the risk tolerance is going to be pretty low. So this is one of the reasons why for the past month over. Yeah, in the past month, I haven't really participated in Degen yield forms because market bearishen, you know, Degen yield farms are less likely to form. It doesn't mean that you can't make money.
00:01:56.340 - 00:02:28.796, Speaker A: But, you know, that's the thing. Competition has been destroying us, okay? So, no, our product is bad Aave rewards go down. Okay? Like maybe they didn't plan for the Aave rewards going down. Personal health issue, like maybe too much McDonald's. And because I guess due to the above reasons and people left and I guess people lost money because they didn't really do the research and then they're like attacking the team members. Okay, so this is a soft drug. A hard rug is when there's something malicious in the code and they can just take your money that you stake.
00:02:28.796 - 00:03:11.938, Speaker A: But a soft drug is something that you can't really control, right? Just like if the developers leave, then the token goes to zero because there's no product. Right? So that's what a soft drug is. And I was going to go back to, I also mentioned this in the live stream, right? Why I'm like focusing on safer farms where this tweet with, from hedgehog, who I had a podcast with, when projects start rugging, as they have recently, it's the equivalent of market selling tokens without regard for price, right. Because what Polywell, like what the developers did was they sold the tokens that they had, I think it was like roughly a million dollars. And they just wanted like no part with the project because they didn't really see a future for it. This is quite bearish and characteristic of subtle shift from bull to bear mentality. And he posted this June 5.
00:03:11.938 - 00:04:15.716, Speaker A: And you know, I think he's pretty much right because the developers that make these old forms, they're not really in it to change the world. They're in it to make money. And as soon as these developers find out that this market isn't primed to make money, there's going to be like, all right, we're anonymous, we're going to leave and we're going to blame tokenomics, we're going to blame our personal health issues, whatever. I mean, I don't want to downplay that because they might actually be suffering from mental health issues, but that's generally what happens. And I put out this tweet earlier today about a data point that suggests a shift from bull to bear. I mean, I'm just reiterating what hog said, where soft rugs are pretty bearish for yield farms because I guess back in April when the markets were hot, the odds of the Degen yield farms performing well were pretty high because everyone wants to make more money. Money is flowing around everywhere, but when people are losing money, then these farms are less likely to succeed.
00:04:15.716 - 00:04:39.158, Speaker A: So what's gonna end up happening is, or this is my prediction, like the next new farm that comes out is more likely to be a soft rug than a farm two months ago. I'm not saying anything novel here, right, but that's just like how it's gonna. I mean, that's just how it's gonna be and the way to avoid hard rugs. Right. Hard rugs, meaning like the developers just take your money out, right. Is looking at rug doc had an interview with her. It was great.
00:04:39.158 - 00:05:15.526, Speaker A: So generally you want to go into things with lower risk and not enter things with high risk, but rogue doc does. I mean, they can't predict whether the developers are going to leave or not, right? I mean, that's like more psychological. They can't really control human actions. I mean, they can look at the code, but they can't really, like, control how, like whether or not the developer leaves. So, you know, this is quite sad from like, a yield farming perspective, but, you know, it's something that you should consider and that should be something you consider into your, I guess, risk metric going forward. So, you know, I'm just focusing on safer farms, right. And, you know, when.
00:05:15.526 - 00:06:04.314, Speaker A: When I think about yield farming, at the end of the day, I made this video about where is it, like, how be yield farming in a potential bear market? And this went over like, I guess the goal of farming is to essentially, you know, either stack your favorite coins, stack dollars, so you can dollar cost average the bottom, or you can farm speculative positions. So obviously what I've been farming recently was accumulating Qi dao, right? And I've been farming this, like, in mid May, right? May 24 here. And I believe this is May 30. I had almost 900 qi tokens at, you know, now Qi tokens were just below. Just below $3, and I have roughly 1000 of them. So I decided to sell three quarters of it. So I sold 750 Qi to buy more bitcoin.
00:06:04.314 - 00:06:25.522, Speaker A: Right? I mean, that's. I mean, that's essentially what my plan was. I just wanna accumulate more bitcoin because bitcoin is gonna stand the test of time while cheat out. Well, I like the project, I like the coin, but I'm not gonna marry the token. Cause it can go to zero. And I would not be surprised, right? I mean, I'm not like being bearish cheetah. I actually really like the team.
00:06:25.522 - 00:06:53.534, Speaker A: They are always shipping products, but I hold no allegiance to the token. I just farmed this with dollars for the past, I guess, in total, three to four weeks. And I accumulated essentially two, two k of bitcoin for free. And that's the idea of farming, right. I. My goal is to stack my favorite coins, right? So I farmed a speculative asset chi, when it was thirty cents, thirty six cents. And once it goes to $3, I'm like, cool.
00:06:53.534 - 00:07:08.552, Speaker A: I'm gonna buy bitcoin with it, right? Like, so, yeah. And I still hold 250, right. A quarter of my position. Just because I think it could go up, it doesn't mean I think it will. I mean, yeah, right. I just have a moon bag. Once they roll out staking, I'll just stake it.
00:07:08.552 - 00:07:41.762, Speaker A: And if it goes to zero, then whatever. I just took most profits anyways. But, you know, just capturing the upside, always protecting myself to the downside. And you know, just like this, this is like generally the mindset I have for farming. And you always have to adjust to the market environment, right? Like, who in their right minds is, like, buying farm tokens when bitcoin is trading at 32.5k, right. So for me personally, I just want to accumulate more bitcoin just because I think it'll outperform to the upside and downside.
00:07:41.762 - 00:08:14.166, Speaker A: And, you know, like, look, I mean, all these altcoins are down ten to 20%. It's pretty brutal. So my focus is stacking bitcoin, stacking ethereum, and I mean, I've been farming for, let's see, let me go back to this tweet. I mean, I've just been, I'm still a crypto permable, right? I mean, I'm making these videos like three to five times a week. But there's nothing wrong with farming stable coins and dollar cost averaging slowly into your favorite assets. So I farmed Qi dollar cost average into bitcoin. I still have a pretty big stable coin stack.
00:08:14.166 - 00:08:43.343, Speaker A: So I'm going to dollar cost average into bitcoine ETH and maybe even like Aave or sushi. I'm still thinking about it. Maybe provide liquidity to just generate those yields. But this is generally what I'm thinking, and this is how I'm like, approaching the markets, because market's bearish, far more stable coins. Because the entire thesis of my stablecoin farming thing since mid May was I think the markets are going to go sideways, it might go down a little. So who's going to outperform? It's the stablecoin farmers. And I.
00:08:43.343 - 00:08:54.859, Speaker A: I think I've generally outperformed, right? And I've been transparent with what I've been doing. So thank you guys for watching.
