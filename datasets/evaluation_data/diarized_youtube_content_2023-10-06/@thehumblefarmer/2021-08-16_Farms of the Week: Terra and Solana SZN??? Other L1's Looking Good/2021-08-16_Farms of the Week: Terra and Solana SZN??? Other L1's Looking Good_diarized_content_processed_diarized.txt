00:00:00.640 - 00:00:30.288, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here. And welcome to farms of the week, where I'll be going over the farms I'm currently in, as well as the farms I'm watching. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so I want to just first touch on the price of Luna just because it's been going ballistic right outside of Solana and Axie Infinity. I feel like it's one of, it's one of the few altcoins in top 50 that actually breached its previous all time highs. And I'm pretty proud of this call because I identified Luna as a really good play in early July.
00:00:30.288 - 00:01:11.698, Speaker A: And on July 4, I made this hour long video with terabytes going over, like, why I think this is a good place to deploy capital. And obviously, since I made that video, you had like two to three weeks to accumulate and then it just ran away. Right. So now I guess this just, this is an example of, like, doing your research, right? Because if you look back to what I was talking about in May, I said that, hey, like, markets are bearish. Let's just farm stable coins and accumulate assets that we want to hold for the longer term. And in May and June, I only accumulated bitcoin just because things were so, I guess, uncertain. And then in July, I guess I just, like, bought Luna just because I'm like, oh, wow, there's so much opportunities here.
00:01:11.698 - 00:01:42.830, Speaker A: And obviously, it's one of the few altcoins that has gone up so much. I did miss out on Solana. I'll touch on Solana later. But, you know, I think, I mean, anyone that, like, listened to me and, like, did their own research, I'm sure you're happy with the entire Luna ecosystem and, you know, whatever gains you have on that play. So let's go over what I'm actually doing on the terra ecosystem. So those that know, roughly five weeks ago, I deployed 16 4k into the terra ecosystem. I converted roughly 40% of the capital into Luna.
00:01:42.830 - 00:02:13.586, Speaker A: And ten k I just put into the stable coin, right. Earning a bunch of yield. And right now, the portfolio setup I have now is yielding roughly 48% yield, right. And if you think about it like, this is also an example of, like, you don't have to, like, go all in on volatile assets to make money in crypto because I only deployed 40% of my stack into Luna. Obviously, Luna going up three x is a big factor. But also, I've been farming mirror tokens and anchor tokens and a lot of them. And it's kind of crazy.
00:02:13.586 - 00:02:56.178, Speaker A: Like the mirror in the anchor form is pretty nuts. So let's go over to the mirror in anchor form. So first, touching on anchor, just because Luna has gone up so much, I decided to borrow more dollars against it, right? This used to be $3,500 last week, but now it's $5,500, right? So I just added $2,000 more, yielding 19%. And if you want to learn more about the Luna ecosystem, I suggest you watch out. Watch my video I posted last Friday where I discussed the Columbus five upgrade with Danku and Joseph. Great followers on Twitter and YouTube. Essentially the major update is that first you can have eth on anchor, right? So you can put your eth as collateral and borrow against it and be paid to do so, which is great.
00:02:56.178 - 00:03:21.420, Speaker A: I'm not doing this right now just because it's really hard to get beath, right? Right. Now you have to go to the Ethereum main and pay like a couple hundred bucks in gas fees. I'm not about that. I'm waiting for easier ways to get be, which will probably come the next couple of weeks. But with the additional money I'm borrowing, I'm just putting it in the earn tab right here. Right. So you can't really see the full 5500 because some of it is bonded onto mirror.
00:03:21.420 - 00:03:54.868, Speaker A: Right. This is the rest of, I guess, the ust I put into anchor and I'm not going to go over it in this video. I have a playlist on terra if you're interested. But the cool thing about this ecosystem is that you can deposit dollars on anchor earning 19.5% and you can use, I guess, the claim on these dollars AUSD and you can put it in as collateral here. Five weeks ago I put eleven and a half k into anchor. Now I'm using that as collateral to short farm gold.
00:03:54.868 - 00:04:32.100, Speaker A: And now my value, my position is worth $200 more. Right? This position is earning yield and I'm using their yield bearing asset as collateral to short form gold. The gold farm is doing really, really well. I also long the galaxy, right? I'm in a short form of gold and a long form of galaxy and I'm up roughly 10% on this position. So yeah, I think Terra is a really underrated ecosystem. I think it's actually a really good risk off ecosystem, right? Because you don't even have to have exposure to Luna. You can just like buy stocks and be paid to do so.
00:04:32.100 - 00:04:55.862, Speaker A: So if you look at the farm tab, for example, if you're bullish to Nasdaq or this is not the Nasdaq. This is Nasdaq. If you're bullish to Nasdaq, right. It's just american tech stocks. You can be paid 36% to long, like, tech stocks. That's insane. And I talked about this in my livestream yesterday, but in like roughly five weeks, I earned like almost $300 worth of mirror.
00:04:55.862 - 00:05:38.794, Speaker A: And it's kind of crazy because there are people out there that like, buy mirror tokens on Coinbase, right? And here I am just farming it for essentially free, right? Because I'm up money on my gold short, I'm up money on my galaxy long. And on top of that, on cherry on top, I get free mirror tokens in anchor. Obviously, this, this net APR is being paid out in the anchor token, right? Because I'm paying 23% on my dollars, but I'm being paid 42% in the anchor token. And yeah, it's roughly $176 worth of anchor tokens only in five weeks. So, you know. And this is mostly dollar denominated, right. Even if I didn't buy Luna, I'm still, I can still earn this opportunity.
00:05:38.794 - 00:05:57.070, Speaker A: So Terra underrated. I guess it's not so underrated now. I guess it was underrated when Tera was like at $6. But now people are taking notice, people are doing their research. And honestly, I don't know if terror is a good buy. I'm sure if you take a five year time horizon, yeah, it's a great buy. But I mean, not financial advice.
00:05:57.070 - 00:06:21.768, Speaker A: I covered it here. Now, I don't know. You got to do your own research. And the one form that people overlook on Luna is this Luna to be Luna farm on Terraswap. So if you provide liquidity for Luna and bonded luna, you can be paid 22% apr. So this is not, you're not taking on much improvement, loss, risk just because, I mean, they're both like assets. Be Luna does have a premium, I believe.
00:06:21.768 - 00:06:43.488, Speaker A: But, you know, this is something that you, that might interest you if you just want to buy a bunch of Luna because they're super bullish and you just want to earn a yield on it, right. You can just. If you don't want to stake your Luna, you can earn 23%. So there's that. And also, I'm done with Tara now. I'm going to quickly touch on avalanche. I spent like 20 minutes on this on my live stream, so I'm not going to spend too much time on it.
00:06:43.488 - 00:07:01.464, Speaker A: But Benki is a money market that's going to launch on avalanche on the 19 August. Right. Where you can use Avax, Ethlink, bitcoin, and some stable coins as collateral and borrow against it. Right. It's a money market and it's backed by the avalanche team, which is really bullish. Right. $3 million of Avax rewards.
00:07:01.464 - 00:07:33.324, Speaker A: And there's going to be the key token, the Qi token, the Venki token will also be. You can also be able to form it as well. So I'll definitely be placing my assets there. If you want to hear my thesis on it, then check out the live stream. So let's touch on polygon because, you know, I feel like I've been in Polygon for, let's say, like, four months now. And polygon is obviously a really great place to be, but I feel like I'm gonna just, I guess, diversify my assets into other ecosystems. Right.
00:07:33.324 - 00:07:49.116, Speaker A: Because sure, curve is great. Right. I still have some dollars into on curve here, right. Earning, let's say, like 12%, like always. Good. I'm also farming. Define here, right? And with the USD.
00:07:49.116 - 00:08:19.030, Speaker A: USDT form, I pulled out a dinosaur last week just because, you know, I felt like I had a thesis where my stop loss was $1.60. And even when the token went below that price, I kind of was, like, holding out hope that it would do well. But like I always say, like, never marry a farm and hope is not a strategy. And I feel like it kind of had, like, a psychological or mentally, I was, like, kind of attached to that. I know. And I kind of was hoping. And when I noticed that, I'm like, okay, like, I gotta stick to my thesis.
00:08:19.030 - 00:08:43.896, Speaker A: I had a plan going into it, and when that plan doesn't work out, I just have to get out. So pulled out a dyno put my USt USDT pool is in here. And the dollars that I made, I'm putting it in curve, but I might even take out some assets from Polygon just because I think there's opportunity costs. Right. First on avalanche, this might be a good one. I don't know what the rates are going to be, but it might be good. Also, Cardano is coming up next month.
00:08:43.896 - 00:09:08.130, Speaker A: I also covered it last yesterday on my livestream, so check it out there. And also, I'll touch on Solana later too. But before I talk about Solana, I just want to quickly touch on Mstable. This is, by the way, I'll provide links to all of this in the description below. But this is similar to kerb. Right. Mstable is a really well capitalized project with a bunch of VC's and investors.
00:09:08.130 - 00:09:56.764, Speaker A: So I consider them to be pretty safe. It's similar to curb, where you can deposit stable coins, right? And you can stake those stable coins to earn MTA and matic rewards. So right now, if you put your dollars in here, you can earn 6%, roughly, plus 18%, like 23% ish total 23 and a half percent, which is pretty good. So it doesn't mean like, if I were to like, withdraw assets from polygon, it doesn't mean that I'm bearish polygon, it just means that, you know, I think there are better opportunities out there. And like I always say, I'm not a polygon maxi, I'm a yield maxi. I go where the yields are, where the yields are safe with a good risk return. Speaking of which, let's talk about Solana, right? Because like I mentioned, it's one of the few coins that actually breached all time highs before bitcoin did, right.
00:09:56.764 - 00:10:39.870, Speaker A: I think it's axie infinity. Luna and Solana are only three tokens that have breached all time highs. And kind of caught my eye because I wasn't that interested in Solana just because there's no money market, right. But the thing is, when you're farming, you want to follow the hot ball of money. You want to go where the money is, because that's essentially where all the projects are going to be built. That's where all the attention is going to be. So despite having no money market, a lot of these farms have, I guess, locked in a bunch of liquidity, which makes me think if a money market does go online, if Aave does go online, or if a project like Solande, they have like a cap limit on like, amount of money they can take in.
00:10:39.870 - 00:11:08.810, Speaker A: This is also a money market. And mango is also like a pseudo money market too. But there, there isn't like a full, like a pure money market play on Solana. I feel like if Aave, hypothetically, were to launch on Solana, like, ave is gonna have like ten billions locked into Solana and this ecosystem is gonna thrive. I mean, this ecosystem is already thriving, but, you know, it's, it's something that I think people should look into. And don't get me wrong, I'm still in the research phase, right. But let's just go over some forms that I think is pretty good.
00:11:08.810 - 00:11:26.906, Speaker A: So first is called sabre. This is basically like curve on Solana, right? It's just trading like assets. And if you look at all these yields here, it's pretty insane. For bitcoin, you can earn 48%. Like, that's crazy. Also, this is another. I don't know what PBTC is, but, you know, it's for swapping, like, assets.
00:11:26.906 - 00:11:43.772, Speaker A: So you're not really taking on impermanent loss risk, but you can earn actually 40% to 60% yield. Pretty nuts, by the way. Like, I haven't really done research on, like, how safe these things are, so. Always your own research. But I'm just briefly going over what I'm looking out for. Right. I have no funds on Solana right now.
00:11:43.772 - 00:12:21.200, Speaker A: Mercurial is also an interesting one. It's not as high as a saber, but, you know, you can put USt, USDT wrapped UST or in USDC and earn 34%. So if you're more of a risk averse person and you just want to earn yield on your stable coins or bitcoin, then, oof, this is a good one, I think. Yeah, you can earn 17% on Solana, 14% on serum, 34% on FTT. I mean, it's pretty good, I believe. Lastly, I'll touch on radium. I'm not a huge fan of radium in terms of forms, just because, I mean, I guess it's a good form, but I'm not really too bullish, token, just because it's so inflationary.
00:12:21.200 - 00:12:54.454, Speaker A: But I. These are also pretty good forms that you can look into where you can provide liquidity for, you know, various assets. They all have impermanent loss risks, so obviously the rewards are going to be much higher. But, you know, copra is a pretty good one, I believe. Mercurial ray. I mean, I'm sure most of these projects aren't scams and they're not going to die. You are taking on improvement, loss risk, obviously, but, you know, if you want to earn yield on, you know, your raid tokens that you might have, you know, provide liquidity for ray eth, earn 76% paid in raid tokens, you know, something to look into.
00:12:54.454 - 00:13:32.926, Speaker A: So, you know, definitely looking into other ecosystems more. I feel like I was kind of complacent in the, let's say, in like, the last couple of weeks just because I was so focused on Luna and how great it's been doing. And I'm really happy that Luna has made me a lot of money, but I feel like, you know, I'm. I kind of overlooked Solana as a potential ecosystem. I think Solana people, it's still really, really early in the Solana ecosystem. Same goes for avalanche, cordano, Polkadot, phantom, etcetera. But I think it pays to be open minded.
00:13:32.926 - 00:14:11.576, Speaker A: It pays to look into other ecosystems, because if you're in the know about what's actually happening in these other blockchains, then it might present a good opportunity for you. Because if you knew that the Solana ecosystem is thriving, then maybe you could have longed Solana during the dip. Right? I overlooked it, my problem. But no, the one thing I guess that I did get right was, okay, I knew the Terry ecosystem was thriving. So after an 80% dip, I just bought and I just earned yield on it and now it's going up. So, you know, just want to talk about like, yeah, just don't be a, don't be an ecosystem, maxi. Be more open minded.
00:14:11.576 - 00:14:35.276, Speaker A: Look at other ecosystems. An ecosystem like avalanche, phantom Harmony. There's not much being built, but I suggest everyone follow them on Twitter, maybe follow a few of their projects and just keep up with the news. Right? Because there is going to be a phantom season. There is going to be a harmony season. I don't think it's coming just yet. I think right now it's mostly Solana and Luna season.
00:14:35.276 - 00:15:04.214, Speaker A: Maybe avalanche, maybe Cordano soon. But, you know, just keep up with the news. I think that's the most alpha that you can do yourself because, you know, just using me as a data source, I'm always doing research. But it's, it's going to be impossible for me, for me to catch all the pumps. And also it's, it's kind of impossible to catch all the pumps too, right? Like, don't expect to catch all the pumps. Like, I'd rather be really good at like three ecosystems than be like average at like seven ecosystems. It just doesn't make sense.
00:15:04.214 - 00:15:14.870, Speaker A: So hopefully this video was helpful. I went over a lot of things here. Yeah. Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you guys for watching. Please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below.
00:15:14.870 - 00:15:15.950, Speaker A: And have fun farming out there.
