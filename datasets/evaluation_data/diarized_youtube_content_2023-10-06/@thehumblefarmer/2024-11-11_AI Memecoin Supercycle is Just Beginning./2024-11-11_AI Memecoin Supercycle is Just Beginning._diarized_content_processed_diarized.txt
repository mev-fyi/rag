00:00:00.640 - 00:00:35.541, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Taiki here. And in this video I want to discuss utility versus meme coins, my portfolio construction, and the bullish catalysts that lay ahead. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord link will be in the description below. I post three weekly premium content every single week. So let's get right into it. So one of the biggest argument or topics up for debate right now is with a Trump victory, what's going to do better? Meme coins or utility coins? So far in the past week it's been meme coins. And I think if you asked me two months ago this question, I would have said utility because I'm a defi guy.
00:00:35.541 - 00:01:06.839, Speaker A: I've been looking into defi stuff and you know, it's kind of, it's kind of what I wanted. But the thing is I've started, I've started to, you know, see the market for what it is, not for something that I want it to be. And Trump winning is bullish. Everything, you know, everything pumped, you know, and Bitcoin's at like 85k or something. It's crazy. But I'm quite skeptical that, you know, utility will outperform memes. Now the argument for utility is that the SEC has been really hostile against defi coins.
00:01:06.839 - 00:01:33.805, Speaker A: And, you know, they couldn't turn off a fee switch or they couldn't turn on a fee switch. And now that he's going to be out, allegedly, all these companies, all these projects, they're start, they're going to start to do value accrual for their token. You know, previously people only bought memes because all the, all these utility coins were worthless. But now the, now that, you know, worthless governance tokens can be not so worthless anymore. People are going to sell their memes for utility. I disagree. I disagree.
00:01:33.805 - 00:02:20.390, Speaker A: I think two months ago I said I would have said that, but now I disagree. And the thing is like, they're not mutually exclusive, right? You can own both, right? You don't have to be all in one or the other. The thing about me is that you've, I mean, you've noticed over the years I've sunk so many hours looking into the fundamentals, cash flow, all that, and I've come to realize that even if they do a fee switch for all these tokens, they're overvalued or worse, they don't even have any profits to begin with. Right? So, you know, yeah, sure, you know, like your, you know, random defi token can turn on a fee switch. I hope you're happy because they're making like, $10 a year, you know, or, you know, I mean, that's even. That that's good, right? Probably they're losing money every single year. So I don't really think that's like this bullish catalyst that you're.
00:02:20.390 - 00:03:05.949, Speaker A: Everyone's hoping for. You're still going to be really selective when it comes to asset selection. You can't just buy a defi coin just because it's like a defi coin, right? And I don't mean to, like, attack the VCs, but the last sentence here, VC vaporware under a Trump regime is still VC vaporware, right? Just because Trump won doesn't mean that your VC paperware is now going to be better than the meme coin, right? Similarly, an unprofitable defi token under a Trump regime is still an unprofitable defi token. It's not going to pump. It could pump because of the narrative, right? The idea of a future fee switch, the idea that defi can come back. The idea of defi renaissance, which, you know, I kind of popularized. Right.
00:03:05.949 - 00:03:29.685, Speaker A: It's ironic that now that I'm, like, embracing meme coins, of course it can pump, you know, but I think enough people or the people that would buy these tokens have wisened up to the fact that they're not really, like, if you switch, doesn't even matter. So I don't necessarily think that it's going to be, like, a bullish catalyst. And, you know, this is what I realized. It's not what I want. It's not about what you want. It's about what the market wants. You have to see the market for what it is.
00:03:29.685 - 00:04:11.515, Speaker A: And I think in the past, I've optimized my content and research into for, like, a world that I wanted to see. For a world that you wanted to see, probably. But I think I'm coming to the realization that doesn't matter, you know, it really doesn't matter. You know, maybe I was insane. You know, I just kept researching defi content or defi stuff, you know, bought them, right? Caught humble gains, which is, like, all fine and dandy, but, like, was I really expecting, like, these defi tokens to 10x and for meme coins to underperform? Makes no sense, you know, And I'll talk about, you know, just. I think I had this poll result or that I wanted to. Yeah, this one.
00:04:11.515 - 00:04:30.193, Speaker A: Which. This is. This is really interesting, actually. So I asked this poll on Twitter, you know, because I've Been talking about AI meme coins for like a month now, right? Are people enjoying this? Right, Because I've just embraced it. But I didn't really ask for people's opinions. You know, I was like, oh, let me ask. And I thought it was going to be like 80, 20.
00:04:30.193 - 00:04:50.505, Speaker A: Yes. You know, like, oh yeah, we love dehynty. He's back. But it turns out people don't like it. I was like, wow, this really surprised me. The thing is, I'm still going to make content and I'll talk about my portfolio construction and it's still very defi oriented. So it's not that I'm like YOLO, 100% net worth in the memes, it's just that I'm taking it more seriously.
00:04:50.505 - 00:05:09.619, Speaker A: That's the point. And when it comes to my portfolio, I'll show my portfolio. I've adopted this barbell approach. And this is not like a crazy concept, right? It's been thrown around like everywhere. Right. But the idea is the majority of your assets should be in safer larger market cap. Things you can sleep at night with.
00:05:09.619 - 00:05:38.283, Speaker A: And then you introduce convexity to your portfolio by adding meme coins or something that has like an insane risk reward and the barbell to optimize for your sleep adjusted returns. I'm not abandoning defi. I still own actually. Let me just show my portfolio, actually. So it's this as of yesterday. So I mean the markets are pumping, so it might be like off by like a few percentage points and whatnot, but roughly 40% in the JLP, 18% AAVE staked, right. 20 day on unlock period.
00:05:38.283 - 00:06:00.701, Speaker A: Because I'm a masochist. 18% E, 12% Bitcoin, 10% goat. And then like some bullshit and then some shit coins, right? So I mean 68% of my assets are in like a very defi product. And for those that don't know what JLP is, it's this asset. It's not a honeypot scam. It's literally like a, it's like a cheat code. It's quite insane.
00:06:00.701 - 00:06:28.329, Speaker A: So JLP has a 48% APY coming from, you know, platform fees, like perps and dex fees on Jupiter. It's a basket of assets. 40% Solana Target, 10% ETH, 11% Bitcoin, and then 35% stablecoins. So if the market goes up, then JLP also goes up. If the market goes down, it will also go down a little bit, but all the fees will auto compound back into the asset itself. And that's why it Kind of looks like this. You really mitigate your downside.
00:06:28.329 - 00:06:53.963, Speaker A: The biggest drawdown it had was roughly 16%. Like Wick, right. But I mean, like, realistically it was like more of like a 10% dip. And it also acts as the house asset for perps. So if you're trading perps on Jupiter, I mean, I'm not sure why anyone's trading perps on Jupiter because the fees are egregious, you're going to lose money. But since the fees are so egregious, that's why GOP is so good. If traders lose money, then trader losses are going to go into glp.
00:06:53.963 - 00:07:36.461, Speaker A: If traders make money, then their wins come out of jlp. So it might underperform to the upside, but it'll significantly, significantly outperform to the downside. Because when markets go down, dejans get liquidated and then the price of GOP is more stable, let's say. So I made a video on this around March, I think, and you know, it's time for me to practice what I preach. Right? I mentioned that I'm going to denominate my portfolio in the JLP because it's going to do well under any market environment and it's easy to make money in crypto. It's really hard to keep it. So instead of having a God complex saying I'm going to sell the top and short the markets, I mean, realistically, no one's doing that.
00:07:36.461 - 00:08:26.105, Speaker A: However, if you do take profits into an asset like jlp, I think it's going to be really, really hard for you to just get completely destroyed because this asset is designed to do pretty well. So, you know, I'll link this in the description if you want to see it. But you know, I always want to show JLP because it's such a chat asset. Of course there is a risk of like that Thanksgiving turkey where it's amazing until it's not and goes to zero. But I mean, you know, I'm comfortable with the risks personally. And then, you know, still vave, right? E Bitcoin go. I mean, so it's like this barbell of GLP is lower volatility, but still goes up Bitcoin eat up Aave probably goes up goat is like my meme coin stuff, right? Along with like other random like bullshit and then like have like the forest meme coin, right? So, you know, it's, it's kind of like this barbell and I feel pretty good about it, honestly.
00:08:26.105 - 00:08:50.680, Speaker A: And going back to this, like, you know, it is what it is. Right. But I think you have to remember that I've always been a degen. I just forgot my ways over the past two years. But the reason my channel got big is because I was aping into 10,000% APR. Ponzi's on the matic blockchain, right? And I taught people how to yield farm. In fact, you know, some people say I'm like the maraud of Ponzi yield farms like 2021 or 2020.
00:08:50.680 - 00:09:07.469, Speaker A: You know, I just became a mid curve because I had so much ptsd. So nothing, nothing about me has changed. You know, I just make content that I want to make content about. And I like AI memes. You know, it's I love the Goatse. You know, I love the Goatse gospel. It speaks to me and I'm going to embrace it.
00:09:07.469 - 00:09:33.615, Speaker A: And I've been embracing it. And the craziest, by the way, like this, this meta is crazy. You know, I woke up this morning and I was in disbelief. I was in like, I just sat down, I was sipping coffee and like, my jaws were like, my mouth was open. I was like, what? What is going on? Like Binance, they listed ACT and Peanut the squirrel. I mean Peanut, we all know act. Oh, okay.
00:09:33.615 - 00:10:05.303, Speaker A: So ACT is not a scam. So the lore is that the original developer for ACT was really poor and he wanted to work on like this AI project, but he didn't have money, so he posted like on some fundraising forum. Hey, can people fund my, like my life expenses and whatnot? Mike mark Andreessen from A16Z gave this guy money and then, you know, he was like working on this. Someone deployed some coin and then gave the developer like 5% with the supply or something. The developer, you know, just like sold everything for like a million dollars. Cashed out. And then everyone thought it was that.
00:10:05.303 - 00:10:39.845, Speaker A: I thought it was that, you know, because I'm in the trenches. Like, I know almost every single story and like lore for all these coins. And then they just listed it and you know, skipping this, right? It's like, bam, half a billion dollar market cap. It was like a 15 million market cap to half a billion overnight. Like a 35x or like whatever the, like whatever the fuck that is, right? Like if you think this God candle, like, look at this, like that is that is that is the definition of a green dildo. That's like a 14 inch green dildo. Like, you know, low in supply, hard to find.
00:10:39.845 - 00:11:02.987, Speaker A: We found it here. You know, it's going to bring in more attention for the AI memes. It just has to, in my opinion I'm really bullish. And you know, people think this is a criminal by Binance, right? It's like oh insiders. I mean by the way, I mean I have no idea, right? I've like some people, some people I talked to in Binance, I don't think they're unethical. I don't think they're like, you know like filling bags and like listing it. But I mean there's no way for me to confirm.
00:11:02.987 - 00:11:41.155, Speaker A: But Binance research themselves have said that you know, there's 155 billions of altcoin unlocks. They understand that, you know like listing these assets probably not worth it, right? I mean even scroll is like going to zero. And you know the co founder of Binance was like hey, you know like we didn't take a listing fee. We're pro community, right? It's like haha, you know, Binance understands that VC coins are a problem. They're going to continue to list meme coins because Binance needs the crypto community to make money. If everyone, if they only list VC coins and it goes down, only people lose money and then they can't trade. And if they can't trade, Binance makes no fees.
00:11:41.155 - 00:12:12.351, Speaker A: So Binance needs people to make money so they're incentivized. And she literally made a forum post about this on binance.com we're going to start listing meme coins that are not. That's not cabal, right? That's not cabal. If it's not cabal, if it's organic and if it's not a complete scam, they're gonna start listing it, they said it and AI memes, I mean the AI Meme Coin meta has been around for a month let's say, right? Goat has been around for like roughly a month. Goat is like the first. I think I had this here, right? Yeah.
00:12:12.351 - 00:12:55.851, Speaker A: Goat is like the first pump on token that hit a billion dollars or almost. It hit like 975 or something. It probably will be the first. Maybe not, right? But probably it basically got there second act like the listing likely means that people have to start pricing in future listings, right? Binance wants to list meme coins. AI Meme Coins is fits the current zeitgeist and like they literally listed the act like three weeks in or three and a half weeks into the token going live, right? So I think any older AI Meme coin that's been around for let's say over three weeks, I think they have a Pretty good shot at getting a listing at a future date. I have no idea. Right? I mean, I'm not part of like these team meetings and whatnot.
00:12:55.851 - 00:13:27.869, Speaker A: But ACT isn't like, ACT isn't even like a super legit coin. I mean, it's like the guy's like the dev sold his coins and then like the token does nothing aside from like being associated with like the story. And it's like a half a billion dollar market. Like, of course people are going to speculate on like the smaller ones, right? The AI and meme intersection is going to get more eyeballs, there's going to be more stories. Like this guy, he's like, you know, what the fuck? Like, I had 100k in this thing. Um, I, you know, it's like worth one, it's probably worth 2 million at this point. Um, I can't believe it.
00:13:27.869 - 00:14:01.111, Speaker A: I had conviction and held, oh my God. Right? It allows people to dream bigger, stop trading and believe in something by, you know, our main character, Murad. That's literally how I feel about these AI cold coins, you know. And as you know, like, you know, I own gold goat, I own forest. I'm looking for more. Honestly, I only own two right now. I'll talk about other meme coin sectors I'm looking into, but you know, I just think that the cat's out of the bag, you know, this is like the first meme coin meta that's activated so much idle mid curve capital.
00:14:01.111 - 00:14:27.469, Speaker A: Example A right here, right? I also talked to a lot of fund managers. They're buying memes. It's funny because for their fund, like the professional fund that they work for, they're like just like buying like mid group shit, right? And then with their personal portfolios, they're buying AI memes. That's the trend that I've noticed and I just think that, you know, it's going to keep doing well. Which coins? I have no idea. You know, I honestly have no idea. I'm still in mid curve at heart, you know, I'm trying to get out of the mid curve.
00:14:27.469 - 00:15:07.595, Speaker A: But the thing is, I'm going to continue buying mid curve coins. Hopefully I eventually have some success. But it's just what it is. So I don't want you to get cabal, right? Because there's so many. The thing is, if a meme coin is new, like an AI meme coin is newer, let's say like under a week old, it's very likely that it's a scam. If something is three or four weeks Old, it's more likely to be more legit, right? Because no chances are there's gonna be opportunistic devs and kols that will launch tokens like today or something, right? Saying, oh, this, this tech is amazing, you know, and the thing is, like, no one understands what the tech is, right? It's all mumbo jumbo. It's like, oh, this AI is so much.
00:15:07.595 - 00:15:23.461, Speaker A: It's like so good. It's sentient. It's amazing, right? Um, but you know, you have to figure out how to do some on chain analysis. And I think a good, A good. Whoops. A good tool is bubble maps. So I'm not being paid by them or anything, right? I don't do any paid stuff.
00:15:23.461 - 00:15:45.353, Speaker A: But I do think it's a good tool. So I do want to show you how to use it. So I'll do two examples. One goat, and then the second is going to be a cobalt coin. And the founder of Bubble maps, he told me that if you ever see a cluster of wallets, that's like 10% supply, watch out. And if it's 20%, get out. Okay? So that, that's like his internal motto.
00:15:45.353 - 00:16:14.467, Speaker A: So what bubble maps show you is, you know, it's like top 150 wallets are indicated by each bubble and it shows you whether they're connected. So if you look at the Solana filter, then these wallets have transferred Solana to each other. So, for example, this one, there's two wallets comprised of 1.4% of the supply. So, you know, it's probably the single entity. You know, that's kind of how it works. But the best tool is if you click at all, it kind of shows you, you know, usdc, USDT and goat transfers.
00:16:14.467 - 00:16:44.905, Speaker A: So obviously this looks kind of bad, but what you can do is you can click on the middle one here, right? Go to the soul scan. And usually if it's really connected like this, it's going to be like a radium wallet. So I'm waiting for this to load here, verifying that I'm a human. This is a radiant pool, okay? So obviously people are interacting with it because, I mean, yeah, it's a radiant pool. So you can kind of click the eyeball and then it kind of goes away and then you kind of have these clusters and then you're like, okay, like, what is this one? Right. 5% cluster. That's kind of dangerous.
00:16:44.905 - 00:17:17.945, Speaker A: Click on this. Oh, this is another radiant pool. Okay? I mean, this is probably. It's fine, you know, and then you click the eyeball, you hide it, and then this probably is a better filter. Like I said, you don't know how these people are. And you should also be aware that as more scammers know that people or as bubble maps get more adoption, you know, people will try to hide their wallets so, you know, they can make it. They can disperse wallets, tokens, like 5,000 wallets.
00:17:17.945 - 00:17:40.944, Speaker A: And as long as they're not in the top 150, then it's not going to show up. Right? But this is pretty fair, right? So the biggest cluster, I think is this. It's like 2.9%, which is like totally fine. I mean, you know, people buy VC coins and it's like 50% of the supplies to insiders. So I mean, it is scary, but at least it's more transparent, let's say. And some wallets, like winter Mute, I think if you click on win or mute, it's this one.
00:17:40.944 - 00:17:58.381, Speaker A: Okay, so like, this is not like a whale or it's like a market maker. So this seems fine. It's okay. Not perfect, obviously, but it is what it is an example of a cabal. So I chose the most egregious one, which is like 3ac, so 3 arrows capital. So I mean, obviously, you know, you filter for all. It looks like this.
00:17:58.381 - 00:18:29.781, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, like, what the fuck, right? So if it. Obviously, you know, this is the super egregious. Most tokens are going to be better at hiding it. Right? There's like this, you know, there's this rocking. But the thing is, if you see a cluster, just be careful. Sometimes you will see clusters, but it's going to be for like a community treasury or like people donating coins to like a developer. Like, those are fine, of course, right? People are just donating or like whatnot, right? So you have to like, you know, you have to use like your brain to figure out like whether something's good or not.
00:18:29.781 - 00:18:53.495, Speaker A: But, you know, just use bubble maps, it's free, you know, I'm not being paid by them. I just think it's a good tool, just something to be aware of. Because Binance said they're not going to list a couple coins. So if some, if people are shilling like random tickers and there's like a big cluster, then chances are probably not good, you know, probably not going to be listed. I would opt for the older coins. That's what I'm looking into. I'm still looking into it.
00:18:53.495 - 00:19:28.885, Speaker A: I'm really bullish. This entire sector, it's produced Some insane gains in under a month. And that's going to bring more attention within the crypto natives. And it's also like the highest likelihood of getting media virality and also activating idle outside capital from like crypto. Right? It's like AI capital, mid curve capital. I don't like, Whatever, right. And look, I'm not sure how to read into this data, but the fact that people, just people did this probably just means that people are still anti meme coin, which is understandable.
00:19:28.885 - 00:20:05.233, Speaker A: I'm just saying that from a market participants perspective, I have to have a serious strategy around meme coins and I've just embraced meme coins like the AI memes first. So another catalyst for AI memes which I want to talk about is the Jupiter airdrop catalyst. So Jupiter, you know, every year they're going to airdrop 10% of the supply to Jupiter stakers, users and probably JLP holders, which is also like the reason I like JLP. January 31, 2025 is going to be the next one. I think. The criteria is not announced yet, but you know, you can kind of imagine it'll be people that use the platform. It's a $12 billion application technically.
00:20:05.233 - 00:20:42.955, Speaker A: So it's technically like a $1.2 billion airdrop. Of course, if everyone had to sell and there's like no buyers, then the price will plummet to zero. So for people to realize a billion dollars of I guess like income, there has to be like some capital on the other side taking that in and that might come from people selling other coins. So it's not like a zero, you know, it's not like an infinite money, right? It's, it's not like an infinite money glitch. But I do think it's going to be a good catalyst because who's going to get the airdrop? It's going to be a Degens in the trenches. Imagine like a Degen that's put like $3 million worth of volume, got wrecked, right? Lost all his money.
00:20:42.955 - 00:21:03.135, Speaker A: He gets like a 25k or drop from Jupiter. Do you think he's going to just hold it as Jupiter and just, you know, not do anything? Is he going to, you know, swap it for USDC and put it in Camino Finance? No, I mean he's probably going to just buy more meme coins, honestly. Right. It's like the house money effect. You get free money. It feels like free money. Like fuck it, gamble.
00:21:03.135 - 00:21:37.595, Speaker A: Gamba. Gamba. The last Jupiter airdrop benefited. I think Dog with hat the Most is like 10x basically, or 15x, I think, or 20x. So I would expect whatever hot narrative, like AI narrative or sorry, meme, Coin narrative is around Solana, around the airdrop date. I think that's going to have the most amount of incremental inflows. Because honestly, right, I mean, assuming that AI memes are still hot in February and I get like an airdrop, I'm going to buy AI memes, honestly, right, I'm like, fuck it, right? I'm just going to go in.
00:21:37.595 - 00:22:25.835, Speaker A: So this be something to wear out PvE on Solana. Another PvE ecosystem that I don't think people are considering is the base ecosystem. So Coinbase is years behind Binance when it comes to listing their ecosystem shitcoins. Coinbase has had to worry about US regulations, SEC and whatnot. They've been pretty tame. But if you look at Binance, right, like they've listed hundreds of just finance smart chain shitcoins, right? And it pumped, you know, it's crazy and I don't think Coinbase is going to go like that crazy, but you should expect to catch up probably next year and there's clear incentives for them to do so. If Coinbase pumps base native applications, so not like applications that's on all the L2s, but they're going to be in some device to support base only applications.
00:22:25.835 - 00:22:44.179, Speaker A: For example, Aerodrome, they listed Aerodrome. It pumped. Actually, funny thing they did is they bought Aerodrome, then they listed it and it pumped. So they're pumping their bags, you know, and because they pump their bags, they can use their ve arrow incentives to, you know, distribute incentives for the entire ecosystem. Smart move. Smart, smart move. Coinbase, your defi team.
00:22:44.179 - 00:23:50.959, Speaker A: Definitely, definitely Good. So, you know, even Brian Armstrong tweeted, you know, this image of having the dog in him, you know, I had the dog in me. And no, like they're, they're fuck, this chicken went up like 4x or something, right? So the thing you have to price in is that the amount of fucks given by Brian Armstrong and Coinbase isn't gonna approach zero, right? It's not going to be complete zero, right? They can't like get sued or something, but you know, maybe three months ago it was at like a nine or eight, right? They have, they had to give a lot of fucks, but now, you know, we're in the, like, we're going from nine, maybe we're at, we're like at a seven, right? Like this is a clear seven, right? Like Brian Armstrong, like less fucks given next year, maybe it'll be at a 4. Maybe by Q3 of next year it'll be at a 2. Right? You have to price these things in, right? They're going to give less fucks. I think it makes sense to look for base native ecosystem projects that aren't complete scams and maybe, you know, you can buy a basket and succeed. The problem with base native defi is that they're not that great.
00:23:50.959 - 00:24:32.763, Speaker A: So I think it's just me meme coins, unfortunately. But I don't even like the meme coins on base. But you know, if you're like a profit maxi, perhaps it just makes sense to pay more attention because, you know, if base lists or if coinbase lists like defi projects on base, then first of all, I mean it brings more attention to the ecosystem and it also attracts more developers in the future, right? Because they're signaling to the developer community that if you build a base native app and you drop a token and you're not a scammer, we might pump your bags. That's. That's a big enough incentive, right? If I was a dev, like, fuck it, right? Like, why am I building on like arbitrum? Like fuck it base. Hey, drop a token. Boom, hallelujah.
00:24:32.763 - 00:24:55.259, Speaker A: Right? You know, it's pretty simple, right? Just, you don't need to overthink it. Last thing, hyper liquid ecosystem. So obviously I don't know when their drop is, but the last time to claim is 11th. So I think it'll happen sometime this month, maybe, hopefully. And I think. Okay, so first of all, this is per. Like they're the biggest meme coin.
00:24:55.259 - 00:25:15.235, Speaker A: You can see my sell button here, right? I think I sold out like $0.08 complete mid curve. Right. I did not believe enough. I think the cult around hyper community is very strong and if there's anything Murad taught us, it's all about the community. You have to build a strong community and then the token will do well. And I sense such a strong community within the hyper liquid ecosystem.
00:25:15.235 - 00:25:26.165, Speaker A: I kind of faded it. You know, I bought some meme coins recently. It like just like went vertical. I'm like, wow, like this is crazy. I. I don't own any right now because I sold. But definitely pay attention.
00:25:26.165 - 00:25:36.533, Speaker A: I think there's going to be some that like just hit a billion probably. Maybe it's per. I own zero per, by the way. But just pay attention to hyperliquid. The community is insane. It's. It's pretty crazy.
00:25:36.533 - 00:26:11.441, Speaker A: And the reason I like the hyperliquid memes is that there's not going to be that much inflation. So you know, to get your token on hyperliquid, like the Spot Dex exchange, you have to compete in an auction. So let's say, you know, I wanted to drop the mid curve token on hyperliquid meme coin, right? Like, you know, make fun of taiki or something. I can't just deploy it. I have to compete in an auction and I have to basically be the highest bidder. And this Auction happens every 31 hours, so there can only be 282 tickers per year maximum. And the fees, like the auction fees go to the validators, I think.
00:26:11.441 - 00:26:55.817, Speaker A: And you know, if you go to Hyperscan IO, you see that right now the current auction is at 16,000. So you have to pay that much to, you know, get listed essentially. And then the Last auction was 18K, then 18K, then 30K, 15K. So you know, it's going to significantly increase the average quality of each coin. Like you're not going to be paying 20k to get a token listed, right? Just for the, just for the hell of it, right? There's probably like these people are going to try, right? They understand that the hyperliquid cult is insane. They understand that the upside to create a successful meme is very high and they're going to work their asses off, right? So like I said, I have no idea which one is good. I own zero hyper liquid meme coins right now, but I definitely need to pick one up.
00:26:55.817 - 00:27:28.541, Speaker A: It's probably going to be per because it's the first, but I'm with you Gen, right? I'm looking for the micro cap stuff so. And also the other reason I sold is because there's a lot of uncertainty. They might sell their memes, right? If it pumps into the tge, then they might sell their memes to buy the hyper liquid token. Or maybe they'll sell the hyperliquid token to buy the meme. I think that's unlikely because I think people are going to. I think there's going to be like net buyers of like hype when it comes out. Either way, my eyes are on the ecosystem.
00:27:28.541 - 00:27:46.973, Speaker A: So basically, you know, you saw my portfolio. I have two Solana AI memes. I need like a base meme probably. I probably need to find like a hyperliquid meme. Brings me to four. I want to keep it below five. I don't want, I don't want to spread myself out too thin.
00:27:46.973 - 00:28:02.505, Speaker A: But you know, that's, that's what I'm looking into. You know, I'm barbelled right now. You know, feeling comfy. The majors. It's pumping, right? I mean, it's crazy. And also, look at this. You know, bitcoin eats on a green.
00:28:02.505 - 00:28:33.385, Speaker A: There's a lot of red coins out there. You know, the memes are going crazy. So, like I said, you know, it's not mutually exclusive. You can buy memes and utility coins. I just don't buy the argument that, you know, meme coins are going to go to zero. I'm quite skeptical. If you can find the coins that will benefit from better regulation, then, yeah, sure, right.
00:28:33.385 - 00:28:57.079, Speaker A: But I just don't think that defi coins will pump just because they're defi. You know, I just don't think that high FDB coins will pump because Trump won. You know, fundamentals still matter. The narrative still matters. And unfortunately, because the valuations are so high, I think a lot of the crazy gains are going to be in the meme coin ecosystem. I have no idea which ones, honestly. Right.
00:28:57.079 - 00:29:19.765, Speaker A: I talked about some meme coins, but, like, really, are you going to take advice from me? Come on. You know, I was like, buying Uniswap, for Christ's sakes. Funny story about Uniswap. You know, I have to take some Ls here. I missed out on this pump because, you know, I said that I would sell, right? I said, hey, like, if I. If this pump retraces, I'm going to sell. So I basically sold, like, here.
00:29:19.765 - 00:29:48.079, Speaker A: I still made, like, a little bit of money, but obviously I missed out this pump and I was kind of feeling bad, but, you know, I bought, like, other coins that's also up, right? And like, whatnot. So, I mean, I'm not perfect, right? I'm still mid curve. I'm. I mid curved my mid curve bags, but, you know, like, these bigger defi coins excite me less. I still own aave, though. You know, I still like aave, so, you know, for the. For the.
00:29:48.079 - 00:29:59.167, Speaker A: For the people. For the people that wants me to go back to defi. I love. I love my ave. I love my jlp. I love it. I love it.
00:29:59.167 - 00:30:12.927, Speaker A: You know you love it too, right? You love it too. All right, so thank you guys for watching. See you guys probably later this week. I'm recording podcasts with Wayne, Garyan, Chow Wang, and Murad. All this week. It's gonna be bangers. Anyways, bye.
