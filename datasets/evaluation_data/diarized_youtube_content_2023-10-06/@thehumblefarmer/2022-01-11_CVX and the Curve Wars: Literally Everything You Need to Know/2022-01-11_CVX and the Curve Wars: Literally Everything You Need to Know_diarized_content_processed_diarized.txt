00:00:00.440 - 00:00:30.426, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here, and the Curve wars narrative has really picked up steam recently, and it's kind of a really difficult concept to understand. Right. So I wanted to make this video public. I recorded this video with Xerox chaos roughly a month ago for the private discord, but with the recent market correction and, you know, I know a bunch of people is looking for ways to earn passive income through yields and whatnot. I think convex is a really good asset for that. So I want to make this video public. It's literally everything you need to know about CVX.
00:00:30.426 - 00:00:58.778, Speaker A: We talk about why curve is important, what is CVX? And, you know, like. Like, fundamentally why it's undervalued. I mentioned in the video that, you know, I do want to pick up a bag, and I was, like, thinking about, like, which asset to sell in order to buy more CVX. A month later, I still own zero CVX. I definitely will own some CVX or, you know, a curve related asset in the future, so feel free to. Feel free to front run me. That being said, you know, I encourage everyone to follow Xerox chaos.
00:00:58.778 - 00:01:26.820, Speaker A: I think he's gonna be a thought leader in the space. He's incredibly smart, and this video will be proof of that. So I hope you guys enjoyed the video and let me know in the comment description or in the comment section what you think of it. Thank you. What is up, guys? Taiki here. And today, I wanted to have zero x chaos on guess and make this video about convex just because it's one of those projects that I've been finding really interesting. And it's.
00:01:26.820 - 00:01:49.396, Speaker A: I know, deep in my mind that it's severely undervalued, but it's one of the things that I haven't really dove deep in. So Chaos has been a really valuable member in the discord. He's a moderator now. He's always posting about his thesis. And I just thought it would be great to have him on and I guess have make. Make a video that we can refer people to. Right.
00:01:49.396 - 00:02:08.440, Speaker A: Because there are a bunch of people trying to get into convex anchor every single day. But, you know, if we have a centralized video with a bunch of sources and just a general overview of Convex, I think it's going to create more constructive discussions in the future. So thank you for being on chaos. And how are you doing today?
00:02:08.900 - 00:02:11.344, Speaker B: Good. Thanks for having me, taki.
00:02:11.532 - 00:02:21.620, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's just get right into it. So, I mean, I actually do just want to give, like, a brief background of, like, your journey to crypto. And like convex and stuff just before we get into it.
00:02:21.920 - 00:02:46.660, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I've actually been in crypto since 2013. Like, my background is, you know, I've been in the VC backed industry for like, I don't know, since like 2008. More on the entrepreneurial side. So I've started to two companies or three companies and I've sold two already. So, like, my. My interest has always been in the intersection of, like, you know, product business and tech.
00:02:46.660 - 00:03:31.016, Speaker B: And back in like 2000, like probably early 20 1314, like, all of the VC's were pretty much like starting to pour money into like blockchain technologies and whatnot. So I bought a couple of bitcoin back then. Um, you know, it was like, stupid cheap. Um, you know, kind of grew up in like the. Got more serious in the 2017 2018 cycle. Um, and then in this cycle is actually the most interesting because, uh, for the first time, you actually have a lot of just like, more like, uh, apps on top of, you know, kind of like the foundational layer, which is like, you know, ethereum and, you know, all the various, like, l one. So, um, some of the stuff that was hyped up back in like, 2017, 2018.
00:03:31.016 - 00:04:05.880, Speaker B: Now you're actually being able to see a lot of it, uh, come to fruition in and play around with certain things. But in terms of macro, my investment timeline is normally within more in the five to ten year time range. So a lot of my thinking and theses are based off of that. So convex and curve are just one of the big ones that I think are super interesting. Obviously, I'm a super eth and super loonable. So those are different topics on a different day. But today we can dive deeper into, like, convex and curve.
00:04:05.880 - 00:04:06.996, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:04:07.028 - 00:04:12.160, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's get right into it. And thank you for preparing this presentation.
00:04:12.540 - 00:05:16.560, Speaker B: Cool. Cool. All right, so the way I structured it is, you know, going over a couple of topics because throughout the Discord channel, there are a lot of, like, common questions and I think, you know, kind of level setting and getting to a common understanding, I think is probably like, step one before we can have, like, you know, interesting discussions. So we'll go over some primers, basically sharing some resources that I thought were really helpful just so that, you know, kind of shortcut the learning curve so I don't have to repeat a lot, and then we'll go into, like, curve. Why? It's interesting, you know, as an app and as a business who the stakeholders are, and, you know, why I think it's. It's become more of like, the runaway winner in terms of, like, just dexs, then what convex actually is, because it's really, really confusing just because, you know, in crypto, I guess, like, they don't really invest a lot into, like, user experience and design. So all the various bits of information, I can kind of, like, start putting it together for people to help them understand, like, what.
00:05:16.560 - 00:06:03.250, Speaker B: What they would be investing in if they were putting money into convex. And then next over, like, some analytics, which I think that that's probably, like, the core, you know, helping people understand, like, what to look for. Like, what are the key performance indicators so that when you do put money in and if not around, right, like, you should have conviction in whatever you put in and know what to look for in the event, like, you know, you consider, okay, is the investment going, like, positive or negative and whatnot, and, you know, what your exit strategy is. So. And then I'll talk about, like, some fundamentals and catalysts that I see, uh, in the near term and medium term. Um, but with that being said, you know, I'll. I'll just dive right into it.
00:06:03.250 - 00:06:38.730, Speaker B: Uh, so a couple of, um, good primers that I saw, and I kind of pinned this in the discord channel. Um, so before you even, like, think about diving into convex, just look at these education resources. I thought each one is, um, pretty helpful in its own respect. So the first one is really, um, from credible crypto. Um. Um, and, uh, what he goes over is literally, uh, if you look at it, clocks in at about an hour, and he literally goes over, like, all the different interfaces. What curve is some interesting things about, like, the tokenomics, uh, same thing with convex.
00:06:38.730 - 00:07:14.868, Speaker B: And he. He's actually, like, a super, um, you know, technical analysis, more like a trader side, but, like, I'm actually part of his discord. And we. We talk about, like, convex with, like, a lot of, like, um, uh, community members as well. So we got him really into, uh, convex as well. So he. He's become, like, a full, like, you know, convex, like, maxi almost, um, another really good resource is this one, which I believe we actually have a HFA member, a zero x cat who produced this.
00:07:14.924 - 00:07:15.460, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:15.540 - 00:07:47.182, Speaker B: Um, and super helpful. Just goes over, like, if video is not your thing, uh, you know, she has a pretty good. Just overview of, you know, all the different, like, concepts, et cetera, et cetera. Young capital also has a really good resource in terms of, you know, why. Why protocols or why different investors want to get into convex. I'll touch upon that as well. But, you know, another helpful resource.
00:07:47.182 - 00:08:20.220, Speaker B: And then this one from Hugo May was actually one of the more interesting ones that I. I think kind of helped my frame my thinking in terms of more of analyzing it as a business and kind of giving it a little bit more, I guess, taking traditional finance valuation models and kind of like, applying it on top. So I'll go over some of its concepts as well to help everyone understand, again, why we all think it's undervalued. Let's kill these.
00:08:21.000 - 00:08:26.048, Speaker A: Yeah, and these are, like, I guess, primary educational resources for people.
00:08:26.104 - 00:08:26.512, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:08:26.576 - 00:09:01.028, Speaker A: To get a better understanding of it, because this video alone isn't going to help you get to chaos for sure. So go through these resources first in whatever way you want to digest them, and then hopefully, over time, you can understand it better. Because for me, like, I knew about. I mean, I knew about 2020 convex, when it first launched, I was like, that, that's interesting. But it took me a while for me to fully, you know, fully understand it, you know? So I understand. I'm pretty sure that most people, they're going to have a similar journey of hearing about curve. Okay, that's cool.
00:09:01.028 - 00:09:02.500, Speaker A: Hearing about convex, that's cool.
00:09:02.580 - 00:09:03.020, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:03.100 - 00:09:09.388, Speaker A: Why are protocols buying it? And then you kind of get into this rabbit hole of, oh, you know, so, yeah, so.
00:09:09.564 - 00:09:44.560, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, cool. So, so curve, if you look at the app, fundamentally, it's just a dex. There are a lot of automated moneymakers. Uniswap is the beast in the space, and curve is very unassuming. It's interesting, and I think that's part of why people are turned off with curve. You look at the app, and you're like, wow, how the hell do I use this? Because it was designed by techies, essentially, what's under the hood is actually interesting.
00:09:44.560 - 00:10:30.720, Speaker B: And if you look at it, what curve is, it's actually, from a TVL standpoint, curve is actually the top over 20 billion in TVL. Most of it is focused on their core product right now, which is stable swaps. So the best analogy I give to people is think of curve as kind of like the Amazon of dexsitive. Right? Um, if you look at a dex, there's a couple of stakeholders. There's the, uh, liquidity provider. Um, there is the protocol that actually has the product, which is, you know, let's say it's like Luna's ust spell is mem and. And their product, what they're trying to do is they're trying to create a marketplace so that people can exchange in and out of it.
00:10:30.720 - 00:11:34.604, Speaker B: Um, and the third piece is the, uh, traders. Uh, traders want, like, the lowest fee possible. Um, and curve. The reason why curve has eight has been, um, I guess, like the dominant Dex is, uh, their tokenomics model actually makes it so that all of those three stakeholders are aligned in terms of, um, seeing, uh, the protocol, uh, evolve. So the way they do this is, um, if you kind of dive into the token economics curve, the token is actually used as kind of like a reward or incentive for each of the pools. Curve is unique in that, like in uni or sushiswap, for example, sushi determines, like, how much rewards are issued onto a specific pool or gauge. A curve kind of like decentralizes that decision making process.
00:11:34.604 - 00:12:25.540, Speaker B: And the way they do that is if you have curve token, you can actually lock it for a specific period of time. Their locking mechanism is called vote escrow ve curve. You can lock it anywhere between a couple weeks to four years. The difference is that there's a tiering mechanism where if you lock it for longer, you get more voting power. Now, not everybody is interested in locking for an extended period of time. And this is where game theory and stuff gets really interesting with curve. Because if you think about it, the core business or the core liquidity providers are the ones most incentivized to actually hoard curve and lock it because they want their pools boosted more than other people's pools.
00:12:25.540 - 00:13:22.780, Speaker B: So right off the bat, curve has given liquidity providers an incentive mechanism to stay on the platform, because the more curve they accumulate, the more they want to stay on the platform because they've already spent all that time. It's like a sunk cost. And by doing that, then they increase the ability for them to boost their rewards. So when you look at the curve site, you see a range of rewards, actually, which is kind of weird because you don't normally see this in other platforms. And this is all based on how much curve you have locked so that you can boost it. Now, curve, before convex came along, was actually quite not interesting because you had to be a whale to accumulate a lot in order to get a really big boost. So along comes convex.
00:13:22.780 - 00:14:22.416, Speaker B: And convex is actually two different businesses in one. And if you remember the three pillars, you have the LP's, you have the daos that are peddling their stablecoin, or ETH flavor, like synthetic eth or synthetic bitcoin, et cetera, et cetera. Convicts is actually two businesses. And that on May, when they first airdropped curve holders, their first solution was actually for liquidity providers. And what they did was they took the curve model and they're like, look, a lot of people don't want to lock for like four years, but we know that a lot of people want Max boost, right? So what they did was they, you know, they simply say like, okay, we're going to give you boosted curve staking. You deposit your liquidity. And what you get is, let's see.
00:14:22.416 - 00:15:23.020, Speaker B: And what you get is extra APR or the max APR, actually. So if you look over here, every single one of these pools on convex, you're going to get like the Max APR via curve, because curve owns most, convex owns most of the curve now. So if you think about it, they've actually created a marketplace where you almost like unionize all the vote escrowed curve in the form of CVX CRV. All CVX CRV is, it's like a wrapper for a ve curve. And what uh, you've kind of given, um, people or lP's that you've given them a choice to uh, actually just give all your curve rewards the convex. And then convex does all like the boosting for you behind. And all you have to do is deposit your lp in a passive fashion.
00:15:23.020 - 00:15:27.520, Speaker B: Now. Yeah, go ahead.
00:15:27.640 - 00:15:48.196, Speaker A: Essentially, like instead of a whale, or like a whale, like locking off curve for four years to give them, give him herself twisted LP's. Like, now everyone can use convex, like lock it up together and convex can kind of control like most of the ve curve, right? That's kind of like the simplistic version.
00:15:48.308 - 00:17:00.594, Speaker B: Yeah, the simplistic version is exactly that. It's kind of like it's turned the retail LP into a whale, essentially, so that they can kind of compete on the platform as an LP. Now, the only, you know, toll that they give is, or that they take is, look, you just have to lock or give convex control of the vote escrow curve that you receive as your normal, like, you know, income for your LP position. So if you kind of take a step back, then what is convex when you look at like the LP side of the business, on the LP side of the business, what it is, is actually it's a yield booster or yield optimizer as classified by defi llama. And if you look at this like they're, by and large, like, you know, they're actually larger than the rest of the top ten combined. Um, mainly because they service the entire, um, curve ecosystem. Uh, but their model is obviously extendable to others, and I'll talk about that in fundamentals and catalysts.
00:17:00.594 - 00:17:27.110, Speaker B: But, uh, convex, uh, at its heart, its first product is essentially a yield optimizer for retail lP's like me or you, essentially. So when you go in with like stable farms and you want like your max boost, uh, you basically deposited on convex because you're going to get more on convex than if you deposited on curve by yourself, essentially.
00:17:28.050 - 00:17:28.830, Speaker A: Yep.
00:17:30.130 - 00:18:15.654, Speaker B: Okay. Now that in itself wasn't interesting until they introduced a solution for Dallas. So Dao is, I kind of like broadly classify as the Lunas, the spells, the fraxes of the world. And they basically have a product that they try and push out which are stable coins or synthetics. And what they did was they actually launched an incentive marketplace. Everyone at this point has heard of bribing, but essentially, uh, this incentive marketplace was launched in September. It wasn't until September where convex actually convex, an curve got really interesting.
00:18:15.654 - 00:18:55.282, Speaker B: That was really one of the fundamental catalysts that um, pushed both of these names into the forefront. Because for the longest time, if you look at curves, uh, chart, uh, it's actually pretty disgusting. It follows like most of the, uh, it's farm token. Yeah, yeah, it's pretty much farm token. Um, it's actually interesting because every single token essentially follows this path where you get the initial pump and there's a huge distribution period. And let's see. Yeah, curve was pretty bad for a while and then it started picking up.
00:18:55.282 - 00:19:54.402, Speaker B: So this part back in 2020, it was pretty depressing. And then it went up and then it went down during May and then started picking up. But it wasn't until right here where convex launched their marketplace, essentially like vote lock curve was kind of like a thing. And what vote lock curve does is it gives you essentially access to all the curve that's kind of been like accruing within the convex treasury, essentially. So all that voting power that it's amassed via its first solution, it essentially created a mechanism to monetize it with the marketplace. So you do all that via Voltium and there's a lot of tools that are available and we'll go over some of those. But the analogy I'd like to give is if you take a step back and abstract everything, I think everyone's familiar with Google.
00:19:54.402 - 00:20:55.890, Speaker B: And if you look at Google, it's quite core product is search, right? That's how it kind of like amasses most of its like attention and eyeballs. Now, curve as a platform and with their low cost swaps, their Amazon strategy has essentially like, that's the equivalent, right? Like they've kind of built a moat around liquidity and they made it super cheap for people to swap, like, in and out of, like, different stables and, like, different synthetics. Now, Google obviously doesn't make money off search alone. It wasn't until they actually started tacking on advertising. So they have two sides of the marketplace for advertising. They have Google Adsense and Google Adwords. Adsense essentially allows other publishers to tap into kind of like the advertiser base that Google has, right? So if you're a publisher, you can stick ads on your site and you're making money via Google's relationships.
00:20:55.890 - 00:22:01.376, Speaker B: Google Adwords is essentially a marketplace where now you can bid on the space on Google search page as well as on all the publisher sites that are partnering with Google. So I thought this was an interesting analogy, and it helped me frame in my mind, okay, well, convex is actually multiple businesses. And each of those businesses, you have a very straightforward way of evaluating the fundamentals if you know what to look for, because my background is more in, like, business and product. So I look at specific KPI's or key performance indicators to determine, okay, is this thing going to be interesting or not interesting in the long run? So the analogy over here will be Google search is kind of like curve swaps. Google Adsense is their first solution, which is, um, LP's. And then Google Adwords is the marketplace. And Convex's incentive market is essentially the monetization engine for all the, um, curve that they've acquired, uh, via the boost product that they've had.
00:22:01.376 - 00:22:10.820, Speaker B: Right. So now you have, like, those, you know, three key pillars, and you can kind of get an understanding of, like, okay, that that starts to make sense in terms of what convex is.
00:22:11.250 - 00:22:38.252, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like things are being built on top of one another. Like when I. In 2020, I saw a curve and I'm like, this is a shitcoin. Like, what the hell? Yeah, it's like, look at these. Inflationary rewards are ridiculous. Like, I saw the curve and I'm like, bro, what even is this? And then people are locking for four years. Like, are they, are they, are they, are they nuts? And then when convex came initially, I kind of dismissed it just because that was my bias for curve.
00:22:38.252 - 00:23:07.738, Speaker A: And then over time, I keep seeing the data on, like. Or just like, you know, I just keep seeing, like, protocols gobbling it up and stuff. And I'm like, okay, like, there's definitely something here. And, yeah, we'll go over that, like, later. But, yep, it's funny how our biases change. And that's part of being like, profitable farmer trader or whatever investor in crypto, like, you have to be open to like, flipping your biases, like, you know.
00:23:07.794 - 00:23:36.380, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I would definitely agree. I think, you know, I was very much like kind of like a eth BTC Maxi for like the longest time. And then it wasn't until I followed like, I think, crypto yield info. And he basically farms everything under the sun. And. But one of the more interesting ones was he pushed curve pretty hard early on and he was like, guys, you got to understand like, you know, the tokenomics model and why the incentives align.
00:23:36.380 - 00:24:07.820, Speaker B: Uh, the missing. That there was always like a missing piece. Um, in terms of like, you know, why me as like a retail LP, like, why would I be interested in curve? Like, I understand, like the stable swaps and wanting like the cheapest, you know, like the lowest slippage and the lowest fees, um, at volume. Like, that part resonated. But in terms of, you know, how much, you know, curve was like, what the inflation was for curve, the token. It definitely was not interesting until convex came along. So.
00:24:07.820 - 00:25:05.230, Speaker B: Okay, so one of the things I kind of wanted to jump into is actually the tokenomics model for curve. I mean, convex, sorry. So convex actually has a couple of like, products as part of their LP boosting solution. Um, the first one is CVX CRv, which we kind of talked about. Uh, it's basically just their wrap version, um, of, uh, vote escrowed curve. Uh, but what they do is, uh, they incentivize you to actually, um, put, uh, or convert your curve into CVX curve by giving you additional CVX rewards on top. Right? So if you're a curve holder and you're like, okay, like, it's just sitting in my wallet or whatnot, or if you're kind of like in the camp of curve holders where you really don't want to lock it for four years, um, but you still want it somewhat liquid.
00:25:05.230 - 00:26:07.020, Speaker B: Uh, then, uh, CVX Crv actually gives you almost. It's basically like a liquid staking model, uh, where, uh, you can convert it, you can exchange it back into curve at any time because convex has created a curve, CVX curve, uh, pool, uh, within, um, the curve platform. And the benefit is you're helping the convex community by adding to, I guess, like the lock pool. And in return, you're also getting CPUx rewards on top. In addition to that, if any other protocol decides to airdrop ve curve holders, if you have a CVX curve, what they'll do is they'll pass it through to you. So you actually lose nothing by converting it to CVX curve. And that's basically their intention because they want to hoard as much curve as possible.
00:26:07.020 - 00:27:37.110, Speaker B: And then the way the tokenomics actually works for the convex token is over time. For every one hundred k of curve formed, what you'll do is you mint like a certain number of CVX. The interesting thing is the more curve you like or every 100k starts tapering. But once you get to the 200 million, notice that, or 100 million, you notice that you're already at um, 80% of the CVX, uh, emissions that uh, are pushed out. So CVX total supply would never be more than like 100 million basically. Right? And uh, then the question is if over time the more curve is farmed, uh, the less CVX is emitted, then where are the interesting inflection points? Right? The interesting inflection points are actually coming up fairly quickly because right now, because the, like, I don't even think the convex creators thought that this much TVL would actually be deposited within the convex platform. And what's happened is the more TvL that's actually deposited the faster the tapering actually occurs to.
00:27:37.110 - 00:28:45.796, Speaker B: So essentially what you're doing is you're accelerating this. And we're actually getting to a point where almost, I think by end of this year we'll have 80% of all convex basically farmed. Which is pretty crazy if you think about it in the lifecycle of the token. I think Delphi actually, like Jeremy Ong over at Delphi actually did an analysis and based on the current farm rate, by the end of next year we'll be at 90%, essentially based on the current farming rate. The reason why this is interesting is because CVX is essentially a leveraged play on the curve token. What that means is if you look at this chart, once we actually hit 100 million, the amount of curve that's actually going to be farmed at that time is going to be 650 million, right? So at the very least uh, mentally you can think of it this way. Uh, the amount of locked, uh.
00:28:45.796 - 00:29:10.510, Speaker B: Or uh. Yeah, basically locked curve on the platform is going to be at least 6.5 to one, right? Uh, so that is like essentially going to be like the base value. Assuming that 100% of the people that own CVX like vote lock on the platform, the ratio would be 6.5 to one. But we know that the backing, right?
00:29:10.550 - 00:29:12.262, Speaker A: Like, yeah, you can think of it.
00:29:12.286 - 00:29:55.372, Speaker B: As the backing, right? Yeah. Now then what happens after this? Right? What happens after this? That means as more crv is farmed over time, that levered bet gets like basically accelerates. Right. Because convex isn't going to stop providing their lp boosting service. It's still going to be the best boosting service out there because they control the most. Yeah, exactly. So over time you're going to see the ratio of total curve to convex increase from like you know, 6.5
00:29:55.372 - 00:30:11.600, Speaker B: to like seven to eight to nine to ten. And there'll be scenarios where it's going to be like 1020 etc. Etc. Over time assuming that curve continues to maintain its dominance, at least in its current like form. So.
00:30:12.700 - 00:30:26.134, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's why like when protocols buy CBX, it know there's just like these stablecoin protocols are kind of positioning themselves like Frax and like Wonderland bought like $25 million worth of convex like recently.
00:30:26.302 - 00:30:26.894, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:27.022 - 00:30:35.542, Speaker A: Like, you know, he, like, it's definitely a very smart thing to do assuming that, you know, curve is going to be a thing. But you know, I would consider them a blue chip at this point.
00:30:35.686 - 00:31:29.272, Speaker B: Yep. And I think from their standpoint they're looking at it from you know, long term point of view. Right. It's, if they know that at the very least is going to be 6.5 to one, uh, you know, mentally they already have that. But they know that they're, they're willing to pay a premium because if they have like a long term view of their protocol or their ecosystem, they know it's going to be very curve dependent because curve is the best place to provide, um, like my, my best analogy for a curve is uh, right now, like you might think that 20 billion TVL is a lot, right? But if you look at what curve actually provides, it's actually currency swaps at low basis points between like currencies or different currencies. Now if you look at traditional finance, the best equivalent is actually the foreign exchange markets, right? Foreign exchange markets.
00:31:29.272 - 00:33:16.796, Speaker B: If you kind of assume that at some point all of traditional finance rails are going to be on Defi and you're going to look at like, okay, what mechanisms or what protocols are open enough, stable enough, time tested enough, right, from longevity as well as security to be able to handle the volume of FX as a market. FX as a market is actually $70 trillion and that's trading between USD and a variety of other currencies from different nations. But if you look at how everything's evolving, you already know that us, like USD peg stable coins are becoming a larger and larger part. But with keeper and other platforms, you're starting to see an introduction of other, I guess like currency pegged stable coins as well, and with Luna, one of the things Luna has is also like a basket of other stablecoin currencies from different nation states. And I can see a situation where it's not just USD, but a curve becomes like the de facto, like foreign exchange market for defi. Essentially the only difference is in addition to nation state like fiat currencies, it also supports stable swaps between synthetic currencies like the different flavors of ethereum and wrapped ethereum, the different flavors of like, bitcoin and sky's the limit, essentially. So I view the market potential of curve as akin to the FX markets, essentially.
00:33:16.796 - 00:33:55.890, Speaker B: So there's a very, very long way before we get there. But if you have a 510 year horizon and if your thesis is already look, all the traditional finance stuff is going to move over to, um, defi rails. And if, uh, traditional finance is looking for the most battle tested defi rail there is, it's going to be curved. It's not going to be any of these other flavors on all the other chains. Uh, it's going to be on an ethereum chain and it's going to be the one that's like most battle tested that everyone's basing it off of. Um, that has the best tokenomics model, which is, uh, my, my bet is, you know, long term is going to be curved. So.
00:33:57.240 - 00:34:15.728, Speaker A: Yeah, and I agree. Yeah. And the keeper here you refer to as KP three R Andre's project, which, yeah, I made a video a few weeks ago, but, yeah, it's very early, but yeah, if you have this long term time horizon and you understand, you know, like, why there's so much tv on curve. There you go, you know?
00:34:15.864 - 00:34:43.324, Speaker B: Exactly. So, so that's CVX. And I think the big thing about CVX is, okay, we just went over the boosting solution. Why the tokenomics works with that. And what's the analogy? Right. Um, a lot of people ask like, oh, well, what if bribes drive dry up? Right? Um, now there, there's actually a very clean way. And I, I think the Google analogy is best because my, my background is actually in ed tech.
00:34:43.324 - 00:35:34.280, Speaker B: Um, so I build like all these like real time bidding systems and stuff like that. Um, and I saw the same analogy happen. Uh, when Google first came out with their product, everyone was like, oh, why would everyone use Google and like, bid on Google to be able to find users, right? What if users stopped using Google search? Or what if advertisers, they stopped putting money into Google Adwords, right? And my answer to that is, I view Convex is actually more like a b, two b business. Now. B, two b, meaning if you're a Dow, your business is actually to make sure there's a liquid market for the product that you're actually issuing. Right. So with stables, coins, it's making sure that you can swap in and out of various stables.
00:35:34.280 - 00:36:25.040, Speaker B: And I think this is a good segue into like some of the analytics and why it's actually with Convex, there's like first time ever a way to measure how effective the missions or the amount of money you're putting in into something like how much you're going to get out of it. Right, okay, so let's go into some of the analytics. Let's go into votium or Lama Air Force. I think this is the link. So votium. So first, this site, Lama Air Force is a community site. It's probably the best in terms of just convicts analytics as a result of pertains to how much bribes and all that other stuff.
00:36:25.040 - 00:36:57.780, Speaker B: So when you actually look at the site, they have like a flyer that kind of advertises, like, okay, if you do this strategy, this is your APR. If you do this strategy, you get this APR. And I think it's meant to just advertise, like, if you need to promote it to friends, like, you know, an easy way to promote. If you look at the annualized revenue, it's. It is quite insane. It's based on the curve token value, but as of right now, it's almost like a billion. When curve was before this latest market dip, it was maybe like a billion plus.
00:36:57.780 - 00:37:35.880, Speaker B: But we're talking about a protocol that's basically only about, I want to say like seven months. It basically has like a 1 billion annual revenue run rate, which is quite insane. And startup land, if you actually had a startup that grew that fast, I think the multiple you would put on that earnings is probably 50 or 100 x. You paid that much of a premium to actually buy into that stock. Okay. But the interesting thing is actually votium. So this is the marketplace that I was referring to.
00:37:35.880 - 00:37:43.552, Speaker B: If you go into the overview back in September when this actually, before you.
00:37:43.576 - 00:37:51.168, Speaker A: Go over, can you go to the vodium website just so people have a. Oh, yeah. Quick understanding of what it actually is.
00:37:51.304 - 00:38:39.030, Speaker B: Yep. So vodium is essentially a marketplace. They're kind of like a sister site to convex. And what they do is they kind of like just provide a place where protocols can deposit what we call bribes or incentives. And it provides a mechanism for vote lock convex holders to decide, okay, which curve pool do I vote for? In order to get that incentive. So over here, if you kind of look at this week's, this week's actually, I think, resulted in like another all time high, like seven and I, 7.2 million in bribes.
00:38:39.030 - 00:39:12.754, Speaker B: And what you see is all these different protocols that are depositing and saying like, hey, vote for my pool. Vote for my pool. You have OGN. So this is the protocol, and this is the product that they're trying to push. So they're saying, okay, go vote on my specific pool. So you basically go in and you say, okay, I want some, you know, spell, for example. Then you would actually vote for like, the mimust poll, select one.
00:39:12.754 - 00:40:02.140, Speaker B: And basically you would get the spell bribes that are assigned within votium divided by the number of people who have actually voted. So it's basically your pro rata share into that. But as you can see, there's actually quite a laundry list of really, really, actually valuable assets that are participating in this marketplace. There's Luna, there's fracs, which we just mentioned. CVX itself is actually incentivizing their CVX CRV pool. So you can stack even more CVX via this as well. Abra or spell Alchemyx.
00:40:02.140 - 00:40:51.230, Speaker B: And the list goes on. But the layer that helps you kind of like, look into how much money you can make round by round and like the history. The tool is actually lama Air Force. And you can see that when everything first launched back in September, there actually wasn't a lot of activity. If you look at round one, it was really just Frax and Alchemyx and ank. I think it's actually no surprise because Frax is actually one of tetra nodes, portfolio companies. So they bought onto this concept really early on in terms of incentivized liquidity.
00:40:51.230 - 00:42:36.890, Speaker B: But as you can see, every round, more and more protocols start understanding that a, there's actually a product that they can use to drive liquidity to their pools and basically reward their users for actually like, putting money in into those LP's. And every round you notice that the number gets like larger and larger. And if you kind of look at the overview, the couple of metrics that you want to look at, it's not necessarily the overall revenue, because depending on where we are in the market for that two week cycle, it basically fluctuates. The normalized metric is actually dollar per vote lock convex and dollar per vote lock convex has still been fairly consistent over here. Uh, meaning, uh, even as, even though more revenue has been, uh, deposited and, uh, part of the incentives, uh, the question you might ask yourself is, okay, well, if dollar per vote lock curve is the metric that I should be interested in, like why is that kind of like flat or not going up in proportion? Um, the reason is because right now if you look at convex, there's this concept called locked CVX. Locked CVX is only a portion of the overall supply that's out in the marketplace and we haven't actually reached equilibrium. When I first joined the vote locking market, I think there was maybe 20 or 30% CVX locked because people didn't realize like, oh, this is going to be a thing.
00:42:36.890 - 00:44:03.650, Speaker B: So back in September, this was actually a fairly low number. But as more and more protocols started getting in, into the incentives marketplace, investors like me and you look at and we're like, oh, wow, we can actually use convex to basically be a subscription service to all the best tokens out there essentially as part of my APR. And even though right now from llamasite, it seems like it's flatlined around this 40 cent number once we hit that equilibrium. And I think that equilibrium is probably going to be around 85% to 90% of convex lock. Because I think over time the strong hands are going to win out like the protocols, the dows, the long term investors, theyre the ones that are going to want to lock it for long term and just keep it there. At that point, once we hit that 85% to 90%, what youre going to see is this dollar per volt lock CVX, what we're going to do is we're going to probably see this move more towards this number. So what this number means is every single round, basically you have control over a certain number of CRV rewards and CVX rewards for any given LPD, right.
00:44:03.650 - 00:45:22.042, Speaker B: Uh, so for every dollar that you spend, actually, um, you're actually driving $3.24 of uh, incentives to those LP pools, um, uh, which makes it actually really capital efficient. Like instead of like blindly saying like, okay, um, I'm just going to make, set up a pool two, and I'm going to like just admit this like, you know, um, random number and uh, have to like dynamically adjust it, uh, for the first time, a protocol basically can say, okay, well, uh, I know that if I deposit like 1 million a spell, uh, I'm going to drive for my lp's that are actually depositing like mim, Ust or whatever, $3.24 of uh, rewards. Um, so then the number you have to ask yourself is, uh, is it one to one? Yet? If the answer is not one to one, then there's actually still a lot more upside for bribes, right? It means you can actually do 325% more bribes and still be profitable, which means this number of $0.40 could easily be at today's curve. And convex prices, the equilibrium price for dollar per VlCX should actually be $0.40
00:45:22.042 - 00:46:30.584, Speaker B: times 3.25, which is about, you know, $1.30 maybe, right? But again, that depends on two things, like the price of CVX and the price of CVR, because those are the two rewards that are being pushed to LP holders. So if you ask me, like, is this thing scalable? I think if you think that curve token value is going to increase, like long term, forget about short term price fluctuations, and convex price is going to increase over the long term, then, uh, every dollar that you spend, um, this number would, will equally go up over time as well. Uh, which makes it, um, uh, still like a valuable market for someone to actually go in and bribe versus just randomly doing your emissions. That's why spell has effectively, they, they kind of went to more of like a 0% emissions strategy. Uh, they said, look, we're not going to like, incentivize, um, uh, the pools the old way, uh, where, uh, we do dual rewards and we like, leave it here.
00:46:30.584 - 00:47:03.590, Speaker B: What we're going to do is we're just going to use votium because we know for every, like, dollar spell we put in, we know exactly how much we're going to get out. And then every two weeks, I'm just going to adjust it based on like, what the market is saying. So. So that's why it's more of like a b two b tool. Uh, when you look at it, similar to Google Adwords is a tool for marketers to basically measure their advertising spend, right? So emissions is fundamentally kind of like advertising at the end of the day, because you're using your admissions to kind of attract more users and more holders onto your product. So.
00:47:04.530 - 00:47:18.512, Speaker A: Yeah, fully agreed. Yeah. It's sort of like how avalanche rush. It's like, it's just pure marketing. Right? Hey, come to our chain, we'll give you free money or free ax tokens. It is a form of marketing. These high aprs, it doesn't, it doesn't have to be higher.
00:47:18.512 - 00:47:20.344, Speaker A: It's attractive enough aprs.
00:47:20.472 - 00:47:35.776, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. And I think that I'm pretty sure, like, you know, the, the big brains over at Avax, they have like their own mental framework or, you know, financial framework of assessing. Like, okay, if I push this amount, like, this is how much we're going to get back like ideally.
00:47:35.848 - 00:48:11.628, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's all like, yeah, it's funny too, because when, when, when these foundations announce these liquidity money programs, they can assume that the token price will also go up because of like, because people price in the future adoption. And I feel like that's what I mean. This is not related to curve, but in complex. But that's what I kind of noticed. It's like these foundations can just announce liquidity mining programs and like they'll just like increase the value of their treasury by like two, three, four, x because everyone's going to buy the tokenization anyways. Yeah, let's continue on.
00:48:11.724 - 00:48:23.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that was the entire summer essentially, right? Summer into fall. Like every foundation basically followed the matic playbook in terms of like, okay, I'm going to announce, you know, my matic version. So.
00:48:23.492 - 00:48:25.660, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny.
00:48:25.780 - 00:49:31.050, Speaker B: Okay, so the other, you know, again, in the spirit of like teaching people how to fit. So, so the thing that I would look for over the long, long term is how close are we getting to equilibrium? And then what does that mean in terms of how much I'm getting in terms of yield? The way I look at it is at some point we're going to get to more like a plateau in terms of how much blocked convex you're going to actually have on the platform right now, it's at 66%. I think it's definitely going to slow down once you get into the 90% to 95% because we see the exact same thing with actually curves, amount of vote escrow tokens. I think before convex came out, it was maybe about 30%. And then now it's been hovering between 90% to 93% locked, which is crazy. And that's when you saw the supply shock and you saw the test pump. That happened.
00:49:31.050 - 00:49:59.560, Speaker B: And once BTc settles, I think we're going to see a pump of curve into double digits, essentially. Okay, well, that's assuming bitcoin. We're not the end of the bull run. Take everything with a grain of salt. I'm just anonymous guy, so take what I say with a grain of salt. My horizons. Anyway, like longer term.
00:49:59.560 - 00:50:03.544, Speaker B: So even if we went there tomorrow, it's, you know, it's fine.
00:50:03.712 - 00:50:04.448, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:04.624 - 00:50:40.940, Speaker B: Okay. Um, now the other thing is, uh, there's this awesome dashboard that this other community member, uh, created. And let's see if this is the right link. Yep. Okay, so, uh, convex, uh, this convex dashboard is like actually super helpful, um, in the sense that you can actually see how much convex is actually currently locked or curve is locked within the convex protocol. And this is essentially what you were alluding to the back treasury. There's actually money behind already that's locked in the protocol already.
00:50:40.940 - 00:51:54.822, Speaker B: This is the amount of convex that has been locked, but this is how much is staked. And what you can see is over here you notice like the total convex number is getting close to that 80%, right? Right now it's at like 779, but it's getting very close to that 80%. And at that point it tapers even further, which means it's harder and harder for people to farm, which means it's also for the farm. And for the people that are farming and dumping, there's actually less cell pressure on the token as well as it kind of shifts from weak hands to strong hands. And what you want to see is over here, you want to see more and more CVX CRV being staked over time, but you want total CVX CRV to increase over time, but you also want more stakes. So over here, this is pretty healthy. If you looked at this dashboard in the future and you see this plateauing instead of up and to the right, uh, then that kind of signals to you, okay, well, maybe people aren't parking or LP's aren't parking their money.
00:51:54.822 - 00:52:36.480, Speaker B: And the flywheel is kind of like broken on. On convex. So I don't look at things in dollar amounts, I look at things in terms of like unit amounts. Um, so what you want to see is, again, that the. The first product that convex has, which is, um, this one is actually doing its job, right? Because if this one's doing its job and you're seeing a. The amount of CVX CRV increasing over time, and people are consistently staking it over time, then that means this marketplace is going to be more and more attractive over time as well. So those are kind of like, from the mental standpoint, what you want to look at in terms of data points.
00:52:36.480 - 00:53:42.650, Speaker B: And you can see over here that because the LP solution is so effective, the amount of LP's that are being deposited has accelerated significantly, especially like past the summer into now. Convex revenue is basically the amount of CRV that is farmed through the LP programs or the LP boosting solution that they have. So if people feel like convex is still the best place to park your lp, then they will deposit. And this number should theoretically be up and to the right as well. And if you kind of look at it, there are this in terms of raw numbers as high, which is what you want to see, you want to see like a consistent increase. But you also see convex total revenue over time. You're looking for more of like this exponential curve, right? Um, so the steepness of this curve is starting to increase because, um, you know, the.
00:53:42.650 - 00:54:33.536, Speaker B: The number of deposits as well as like, you know, price appreciation of like assets and stuff has increased as well. But this is exactly what you want to see over time because it kind of brings like that narrative to the forefront of like, look, convex is basically like an income, like a revenue producing beast for LP's. Um, you know, they're already generating like 1 billion of revenue annually. Uh, if you were like a company generating 1 billion of revenue annually within seven months of your life existence, uh, there should be at least like a 50 or 100 x multiple on your earnings. Um, and right now, convex is basically valued at what, like one or 1.2 billion market cap, uh, on 1 billion of revenue. Which means right now the PE ratio is literally like one or 1.2
00:54:33.536 - 00:55:13.610, Speaker B: to one, which is really unheard of if you actually, if you go by traditional finance valuation metrics, like, it's ridiculously undervalued in that respect. Over here you see the convex curve locked for a CRV. Locked. So this one, this ratio is based off of like basically what it said, locked. CVX is like that 66% portion. And convex CRV is basically the amount of the V curve.
00:55:13.650 - 00:55:14.042, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:14.146 - 00:55:57.220, Speaker B: Be curve in the platform. Correct. So this, I think when you first, like, when this first kind of got on your radar when I first joined your discord about a month ago, I think this was around like seven and change. Right. Then the reason why this is going down is because more and more people realize the value of locking CVX. So in terms of, um, this number, like, I wouldn't be surprised if it kind of like fluctuated between like four and five, um, and dipped a little bit because, uh, it's got to hit that point where it's like a little bit more of an equilibrium. Um, once it hits kind of like 90% to 95%, um, lock, then you're going to see this number reach like, you know what we're talking about, like the 6.5
00:55:57.220 - 00:56:49.222, Speaker B: to ten to 20, et cetera, et cetera. So, and then that's when your lock curve becomes like more and more valuable. Okay. Other metrics that are really interesting are, you know, number of convex holders really, really low right now, which means, you know, anything sub ten k, you're like ridiculously early. A lot of people are like, oh, has this thing kind of like moved on, has it like pumped enough. But this protocol actually only has like 7000 plus holders, albeit most of them are probably more like fundamental type of investors or like, you know, early curve degens or protocols. But over time, I suspect, like, you know, again, this is more in like the three to five year time horizon.
00:56:49.222 - 00:57:54.490, Speaker B: If traditional finance, institutional money, is looking to park their money in solid yield strategies and they're looking for stuff that's like secure, not complex, convex is going to be on the top of the list because convex essentially gives them, checks all the boxes for them, terms of like, it's a business that's easy to understand. Um, once you kind of like, understand like, the framework and, you know, there's all these analogies that I just gave you between like Google and the marketplace versus the search product, et cetera, et cetera. The three pillars are actually really clear. No one's actually like packaged it into like a pitch deck or, you know, something for an investor to quickly and easily understand. Um, but I see in like three to five years timeframe, if you're going to look at like, okay, where's institutional money going to go in? It's going to be in these type of investments. And that's where I see like, you know, you know, convex longer term as where the value is.
00:57:56.670 - 00:58:17.618, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. And it's like really simple too. Like if you're an institution, if you. As long as you understand curve. And I think why it's important. Yeah, it's like, it's like much easier than like farming lp pairs on unity b, three. It's just like, okay, I just buy this thing, I lock it, and I just collect like, yield.
00:58:17.618 - 00:58:21.826, Speaker A: Oh, cool. Yeah, I think a lot of people can resonate with that.
00:58:21.938 - 00:59:14.340, Speaker B: Yeah, cool. So, yeah, so from an analytic standpoint, those are kind of like the two main pieces that you should just have bookmarked if you're invested in convex and you just want to monitor what the protocol health is and whether or not the KPI's are trending up or trending down. So when you look at fundamentals, you want to ask yourself then, okay, convex, I get all this. But who are the people who will find convex valuable? And I kind of have them in like four buckets. The first bucket is daos with product pools to incentivize. So you have the fraxes and lunas of the world, and I'll kind of help quantify that for people too. And then you have daos that are looking to diversify their treasury.
00:59:14.340 - 00:59:30.860, Speaker B: So you have rook, you have time. Wonderland, who just dumped like 25 ML. Yeah, basically to buy about like 1.2 million convex tokens. And we all know who they're going to vote for, right?
00:59:31.320 - 00:59:31.792, Speaker A: Spell.
00:59:31.816 - 00:59:46.140, Speaker B: Spell. Exactly. Now, the crazy thing is, like, they vote for it and they're just basically collecting their own token back, which is a different flywheel. And we'll kind of go over that. But that's where all the gamification comes in.
00:59:46.440 - 01:00:04.546, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, on Twitter, like when he announced it, Danny announced it. Like, people. People in the replies are like, so upset. It's like, oh, my God, you're using the treasury to buy this altcoin. But then if you actually understand CVX, it's like, oh, that's super bullish. You know, that's so bullish still. That's so bullish.
01:00:04.658 - 01:00:14.034, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like you're supporting frog nation, right? So that's his eco and wonderland is basically like his own personal hedge fund.
01:00:14.082 - 01:00:16.456, Speaker A: So, yeah, for now.
01:00:16.488 - 01:00:37.860, Speaker B: For now. For now. For now, yeah, we'll see how it evolves. So, um, and then you have, like, daos looking to aggregate, right? They. They kind of see this flywheel. Um, and now they're seeing if they can kind of put like another gamification layer on top. So similar to how convex is like a levered bet on curve.
01:00:37.860 - 01:01:18.600, Speaker B: They're like, well, why don't we create like a protocol and kind of make a levered bet on like, convexitive and see what type of game tokenomics we can apply on top of that. Personally, I'm not super bullish on any of. I think they're going to all see short term positive price action, but they're essentially funds accumulating convex. At the end of the day, some of them have more reason to do it. Redacted and om are of the same. You know, they're kind of like sister Daos and, you know, Ben, like, just came out of nowhere. Lobus came out of nowhere.
01:01:18.600 - 01:01:42.994, Speaker B: But all of them realized the same thing. Like having, if I have a war chest of convex, like, I can get, you know, pretty solid yield. So let me see if I can, like, aggregate, you know, supply and create interesting tokenomics so that, you know, people will be incentivized to park their CVX. Like, personally, like, I rather hold my CVX and lock my own. So, you know, to each their own.
01:01:43.162 - 01:01:43.466, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:43.498 - 01:02:18.380, Speaker B: Um, and then there's like, the investors, like me just looking for strong, effective APR. Based on my, like, buy in price. Uh, and I'm looking for, you know, future price action at some time. So, um, so what I did was I actually like started like, you know, putting together protocols of participants right now. And if you look at it, there are a couple of different strategies. And actually lets dive into the frac strategy because I thought this was super interesting. So, cryptocondom.
01:02:18.380 - 01:03:11.420, Speaker B: So hes an awesome follower or a follow on crypto Twitter. Hes actually a part of discord as well. So what he essentially did was he was like, okay, Frax got into the bribe game really early. Why did they do that? Right. And what he basically did was he analyzed Frax's approach and what they did to kind of like gamify the convex marketplace. So Frax early on realized the value of it, right? Like the value is if you have more liquidity on your curve pool, you tighten your peg and you can grow your liquidity over time because people will be incentivized to park more money there so that they can earn the rewards. Now, if you look at what happened.
01:03:11.420 - 01:03:47.414, Speaker B: So Frax was basically doing nothing for the longest time. Now, you saw at what point convex released their vote lock solution, right? That was around mid September or mid September. Yeah, exactly. Uh, now, what happened in mid September? All of a sudden, Frax became a very attractive token to hold. Um, and, uh, Fracs did this by being one of the first, um. Uh, I think, like one of the first to really like, test this marketplace out. I mean, they.
01:03:47.414 - 01:04:52.388, Speaker B: They were the ones that like, kind of like, did the most. So they kind of took advantage that no one knew about this and they jump right in. Right? So they really studied convex really early on. And what happened was basically this, right? And the numbers speak for themselves. And it kind of gave people, or dao, specifically a playbook in terms of like, okay, like, how do we play this game? What did fracs do to do this? So what they did was they started accumulating and locking convicts really early on in their treasury, and then they're bribing. But when they bribe the money that they bribe with, because they also have vote lock convex, what they can do is they vote on their pool and they're actually collect their own token back in bribe. And what that really means is, if I own convexitive, uh, I can actually minimize my emissions if I, um, uh, use this bribe and send mechanism.
01:04:52.388 - 01:05:39.730, Speaker B: Because when I'm voting for my polls, let's say I. I put in like 2 million, I'm going to get maybe like 1 million back or whatever, right? And then now I can take that 1 million. So, so the net outlay that I actually did for that bribe is actually 2 million minus like 1 million. So I actually only put in 1 million at the end of the day. And I can keep reusing that over time. It's almost like this looping flywheel concept of now, if I had 50 million tokens to incentivize or put in my pool to instead, if I actually hold convex, what I can do is I can create this flywheel where I'm collecting my own bribes and the 50 million tokens that I actually allocated as part of my token pool for this initiative. It actually lasts a lot longer.
01:05:39.730 - 01:06:30.742, Speaker B: And for the first time, I know every single dollar that I put in. How much rewards am I driving to? Lp's that are helping to create that marketplace. And that's where this number comes in. In terms of, for every dollar I spend on bribes, I'm actually getting this. But this number is actually really much higher if you actually own Votlock CVX as well, right? Because the amount of money you're actually getting back in your own tokens actually reduces the denominator, essentially. So you're not actually putting a dollar in. If you own a bunch of VLC VX and depends on how much you own, you're basically dividing it maybe by like 0.5,
01:06:30.742 - 01:07:22.330, Speaker B: right? If you're getting like half that money back, then, then you're actually putting in maybe fifty cents to drive like $3.32. So Frax figured out this game really quick, and that's all they did. Buying locks, EVX, add your own liquidity bribe, votium, vote for your own LP, receive your bribe back to the LP, plus CRV and CVX rewards. And what they've done is they've actually accumulated, like, a huge war trust. At the time of this post, it was about 700 million. But they've basically, it's crazy. They basically accumulated almost like a million convex tokens within their treasury, and they basically created this flywheel.
01:07:22.330 - 01:08:54.550, Speaker B: Now, the interesting thing is, once this guy actually published this analysis, what happens? He basically starts tagging all the different daos and telling them like, look, if you're on curve, you should be doing what fax is doing, right? So what happened? So he reached out via Twitter to the Luna guys, the spell guys, the angles, and I, alchemyxes and like, the Fae protocols of the world. And the result is now you have Luna essentially just approved the proposal, which essentially talks about the same thing, right? Like proposal one. Like, hey, for bribes, what I'm going to do is I'm going to allocate x amount of dollars. And what we're going to do is we're going to incentivize like two ust pools. And on top of that, Luna is going to actually dedicate 250 million to deposit on curve and actually farm convex tokens for their treasury, basically so they can do exactly what Frax is doing. So the TLDR you can see like over here, they are starting to allocate more and more money to bribe. So they update from I think last, I think last round they did two hundred fifty k and then they said, okay, that worked really well.
01:08:54.550 - 01:09:26.580, Speaker B: So let's allocate 12 million and do 1 million every two weeks to do the mim Ust pool and also incentivize a fracs Ust pool. So right now what we're seeing is fracs Ust and I mim, uh, or spell. They're basically forming like this kind of like decentralized three pool essentially concept, right? They're working together to incentivize their pools so that people will use their pools more than the centralized pools. Um.
01:09:26.700 - 01:09:27.676, Speaker A: It's pretty sick.
01:09:27.828 - 01:09:29.396, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty sick actually.
01:09:29.548 - 01:09:31.484, Speaker A: I can get behind that as a narrative.
01:09:31.612 - 01:10:01.018, Speaker B: Yep. Here. Um, yeah, so, so it's pretty crazy. Like, you know, rook, I don't have a link here but you can easily find it. But they basically said we have a huge treasury, I think second or third largest next to Om Olympus style. And they said we're going to allocate 40 million. I think they still have low thirties to allocate to convex to acquire more before end of the year time.
01:10:01.018 - 01:10:08.138, Speaker B: We just talked about redacted, it's about to launch. All this is applying like by pressure essentially on.
01:10:08.194 - 01:10:32.762, Speaker A: Yeah, the mistake keeperdao made, which is rook is that like they announced it as like a governance proposal and people like front ran that and it was like, I think Tetra bought a bunch of CVX when like, yeah, yeah, Rook announced it and like, you know, so obviously like Wonderland is bought it, you know, just secretly, which, yeah, which is like, that's fine.
01:10:32.826 - 01:10:37.646, Speaker B: Like if you're going to do it, you're going to do it OTC, you're not going to do it like market buy sushi swap like what, Mochi?
01:10:37.718 - 01:10:58.022, Speaker A: And you're not going to announce it either. You know, you don't, you don't say like, oh yeah, we're going to buy $25 million worth of CVX like next week. No, you just do it, you know, like, yeah, I know people don't like that. Just because it's like, it's a chinese hedge fund, but like, it's in the best interest of like time holders, I think. But let's, let's not get into that. I said that was funny.
01:10:58.086 - 01:11:42.522, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's like a separate thing for sure. But, um. But if you look at it now, now you have like all these protocols that have essentially, um, accumulated at least like a million CVX, right? Uh, I know at least like these guys have, um. And, uh, that's already like 5.2. You also have this guy, tetra node, who, uh, you know, actually has like, probably like, I think five to six mil. So right off the bat, 10% of the supply is already in strong hands. Um, and the more and more people that actually start locking CVx and the more and more protocols that see value in incentivizing their lp's and the more.
01:11:42.522 - 01:12:50.120, Speaker B: And these guys are more in the other bucket of diversifying their own investments, the more and more participants enter the ecosystem. Then you can see a situation where, okay, now we hit like 90% vote locked convexitive, and we know emissions are tapering. And there are a number of other catalysts that I'm about to point out that are really interesting, too. So part of my mo is let's just let as many people understand, help people understand what convex is. Let's create that supply shock earlier rather than later and hit that equilibrium so that everyone benefits. Because the earlier you get into convexitive, the better, actually, because, um, you know, I have a number of like, you know, different calculators that help you kind of think about, um, uh, what the yield is. Um, so, okay, so let's say, you know, very, very basic, like bribe model, right? So I got in convex really early, but I still continue to vertically accumulate, by the way.
01:12:50.120 - 01:13:46.450, Speaker B: Uh, so I got a ridiculous number from, um, you know, airdrop really early on because I was into curve early, but when tetra node kind of posted like, okay, like, people are idiots. I don't know why convex is $2. Like, this thing should be like, you know, ten x that you kind of had that rally call. And I kind of like ate ten really hard without, without knowing the volt lock model and all that other stuff later. But as I kind of saw the ecosystem evolve and like the tokenomics model evolve, especially in September, I kind of like went in a little bit harder, right? So. So it's really easy to kind of calculate what your effective APR is, right? So, so for me, let's say when I was like buying in at like $2 right at that time, and I bought like, ten k tokens. Let's say if the VL per CVX bribe right now is $0.41,
01:13:46.450 - 01:14:44.914, Speaker B: um, then, uh, the amount of annual revenue that I'm actually getting from, like, just bribes alone is basically five x my, uh, buy in price, right? Um, so even though right now, if you look at, like, you know, the llama site, right, uh, this whole flyer is like, super confusing. And you're wondering like, okay, why is this APR different than, you know, the convex site? Like 6% APR that I see, and why is everyone telling me, like, this is such a great deal? The reason is convex doesn't advertise the bribe APR because they can't. They don't know what the future APR is going to be. That's why this community site created this flyer, to tell you, like, look, based on the last round of incentives, this is what your APR is potentially based on the current CVX buy in. That's based on the current CVX buy in. Now, let's say you bought it in a lot earlier. Or let me give you a different example, because this is like, you know, not reality.
01:14:44.914 - 01:16:18.380, Speaker B: Right? Now, let's say it's 25, and then later on, CVX is $100. And, you know, this reaches more like, you know, the 1.2, right? Or actually, let's say like 1.6. So even though like, that current APR, like in the future is 42%, right, you bought in at like $25. So your effective APR is actually, know, 166%, right? So again, like, convex, you know, depending on your buy in price and, like, you know, whatnot, um, you know, it's not always up only, but again, I look at it from like a really long term time horizon. So in three to five years, I asked myself if curve becomes more of like, the FX market for Defi, if, uh, convex, uh, becomes a de facto marketplace for curve, as well as other curve like platforms, and if the amount of convex owned by the platform or curve owned by the convex platform increases over time, then I can see a situation where, okay, even if we have, like, bear, I'm still accumulating all these tokens that will be future assets. And the effective APR on that is still going to be really high, because Im playing for next bull, right? As Im accumulating now and Im accumulating for bear market or throughout the bear market.
01:16:18.380 - 01:16:57.358, Speaker B: Everything Im doing now is actually to position myself for the next bull run. So Im not just looking at the convex tokens Im buying, Im looking at all the tokens. That Im accumulating right now because I dont want to sell any of them for short term capital gains anyways. So I'm going to hold them for like a couple of years. And if the next market cycle winds up being three years from now, four years from now, five years from now, that's great. Right. I just have that money parked and like yielding for me and it's not yielding in like dollars, it's yielding in tokens that are essentially assets that I want to hold long term, like a luna or like, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
01:16:57.358 - 01:18:07.192, Speaker B: So, so you have situations where, okay, based on your current and then let's say you're a conservative bull and your bribes wind up like five xing right now, your effective APR and your buy in is insane. So going back to that example of $8, $25.41, let's say I'm accumulating stuff right now and the effective APR is already 133%. But Im looking at even conservative bull case, lets say I think Luna will five x before the end of the bull run, were talking about an effective APR on your buy in of 666%, which is insane. And the reason why thats the case is youre basically buying or youre earning yield and assets that are potentially appreciating. And even if it doesn't appreciate this bull run, I know it's going to appreciate next bull run. So regardless, my effective APR is going to be that at some point in the future, it's just a matter of how long I'm willing to wait.
01:18:07.192 - 01:18:08.260, Speaker B: Essentially.
01:18:08.600 - 01:18:20.712, Speaker A: I think this is just to demonstrate that you get to accumulate assets that you're actually bullish on, I think their vodium. You can choose which one you want to, I guess like bribe to.
01:18:20.816 - 01:18:21.616, Speaker B: Right, exactly.
01:18:21.688 - 01:18:24.728, Speaker A: So like if you're Bush Luna is just farm Luna, you know?
01:18:24.824 - 01:18:25.384, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:25.512 - 01:18:31.296, Speaker A: Spell is this farm spell? Well, spells are going to go away sometime, but in the future it's going to be like that.
01:18:31.328 - 01:18:48.388, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Actually spell, spell. They're actually upping their bribe. They're removing, they're removing the direct incentives in the pool in favor of increasing bribes by like 70%. So, so they're actually going to go all in on the voting bribe.
01:18:48.584 - 01:18:49.468, Speaker A: Gotcha. Gotcha.
01:18:49.524 - 01:19:12.460, Speaker B: Yeah. So, so they're, they're not considering that as quote unquote emissions. Uh, they're saying like, look like, you know, we're not doing any like pool two type stuff or um, incenting the pools directly via curve. What we're doing is we're going to like buy votes on a marketplace. So for some reason they're not considering that emissions to me. Like they're still allocating that same budget to it. So I consider it emissions.
01:19:12.460 - 01:20:01.840, Speaker B: But um, you know, that's fine. That's all like marketing optics. Okay. Um, so then uh, from a CVX standpoint, um, then, then one of the things that I think about from fundamentals is uh, price to earnings, right? Uh, so that's like the most traditional, um, way of evaluating any business, uh, when it comes to like, you know, stock market. And uh, if we consider convex as like a business, and if we consider their current revenue as 1 billion and their market cap at 1.2, then let's say if the PE ratio is 1.2, then what are comps that we can use? To think about it longer term, the market doesn't reach this mindset now, but over time it's going to.
01:20:01.840 - 01:20:28.676, Speaker B: These type of KPI's or these type of ways of evaluating protocols is going to be more and more normal because more people will realize, or more investors will realize. Look, we already have frameworks here. Defi isn't different in the sense of how to value a business. It's just different in terms of how that business runs. So similar to like curve is actually just creating an FX market. We have FX markets. It's just going to run more efficiently.
01:20:28.676 - 01:21:17.640, Speaker B: So it's like a step change technology on an existing market that exists ready? And if you applied, let's say, Apple's PE ratio, which is like below S and P 500, like a 30 x multiple on earnings would make conflicts price like $625. If you applied like S and P 500, average of 40, you're looking at convex price of 833. And if you applied like Tesla's, like Tesla, everyone pours in money in Tesla because they believe in like the Future earnings potential. So they apply premium to that, even though the revenues aren't, you know, quite there. If you apply TeSLA like super, like, bolt hard type of like metrics, like, you know, you're looking at like seven k. I'm not saying like this is going to hit tomorrow. I'm not saying it's even going to hit this bull run.
01:21:17.640 - 01:22:15.060, Speaker B: But what I am saying is when traditional finance, or people that have like a lot of money, like institutions, they look at like these businesses that are on Defi right now, and then they realize that this is just a different way of doing the same thing that we have right now in traditional finance. The only difference is how we do it and how the earnings are distributed. But earnings are still earnings and valuation metrics are still valuation metrics. Then in lets say 3510 years, then theyre going to start looking at the businesses like convex, like, curve in a similar fashion in terms of how should we be valuing this protocol? Right. And I think this bull run is the first time where we're starting to see a little bit of that. But it's still really, really early. But again, I'm looking at it from like, you know, three, five year time horizon in terms of, you know, when, when things like catch up.
01:22:15.100 - 01:22:38.958, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's a little different. Right. Because convex revenue isn't the same thing as earnings. It's more like price to sales. And it's hard to figure out like what is. I mean, it's kind of hard to, like, for example, like I've heard like the narrative for like sushi swaps. Like their price to earnings ratio is so low, so it's undervalued.
01:22:38.958 - 01:22:47.598, Speaker A: Yeah, but they emit, like, they make, they might make like 100 million, but they emit like $90 million of the sushi token. So what is the actual earning?
01:22:47.654 - 01:22:52.850, Speaker B: So that's like, what's their EBITDA basically, right? Like, what's their, um.
01:22:53.330 - 01:23:00.282, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if there's a way to calculate that. But like, even, you know, I'm sure the margins, I guess, is like pretty high for convex just because it's like.
01:23:00.306 - 01:23:22.068, Speaker B: A. Yeah, it's such, like a low cost, like, yeah, yeah. It's a low cost software play. And it's not a complex contract by any means, which actually makes it even more attractive because, you know, the amount of or potential for like, you know, security issues and stuff like that. Smart contract risk is less. Okay. Yeah.
01:23:22.068 - 01:23:45.534, Speaker B: So what are some near term catalysts? So we talked about the emissions tapering. I won't go into that. Curve two is actually another interesting one. I made a post on Twitter about it. Some of the volume metrics are like a little bit off. Defi moon told me about that later on. But the net story is right now uniswap.
01:23:45.534 - 01:25:21.766, Speaker B: Um, even if curve was like, you know, maybe like three or four x of this, um, the maroon isn't going to be like the lion share right now. Lion share of the volume is actually in volatile pairs. Um, now the reason why that's important is because, uh, that's how curve and uni make money, right? They make money on like volume. Um, and curve v two, uh, is actually their first, um, aggressive, uh, introduction of volatile, um, pools, um, where instead of staple swaps, like, uh, you can do like, you know, convex eth, curve eth, you know, like, basically, like any permissionless, like, lp pool you can kind of set up on curve very shortly. So they're kind of starting to drip these pools out. And if you look at the latest, uh, what you notice is something really interesting, because you notice a pool two was incentivized for the first time, and it's obviously curves own, but what they're doing is they're testing the waters. Even if curve two doesn't dominate the same way it dominates in terms of stable swaps, and they take maybe 1020, 30%, what it effectively does with curvy two is actually, it opens up the marketplace for podium bribes to a larger subset of protocols out there, and convex is going to move their pool over.
01:25:21.766 - 01:26:04.836, Speaker B: You know, spell is probably going to move a portion over. Frax is definitely moving theirs over. Those are the existing players because they're already familiar. But I think over time, if curves value prop is lower fees and deeper liquidity and giving traders lower slippage on their trades, et cetera, then it stands to reason that they will take some portion even if they don't get to unilevels. But I think the longer term piece is more. There's additional revenue streams and additional protocols that can participate in the bribe marketplace in the very near future as well.
01:26:04.908 - 01:26:15.692, Speaker A: So, yeah, I heard arguments on, like, curvy tubing, the dark horse, that people aren't expecting. Yeah, I think it's going to be hard to overtake uniswap. I think that team is miles ahead.
01:26:15.836 - 01:26:45.936, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they have purpose. Yeah, I'm not like, like, uni's product is. Is. Is pretty multifaceted in terms of, like, the audience that they cater to. So, um, you know, the curve will take some of it, but, you know, uni, in terms of, like, their approach, they're, they're approaching it with a different audience segment, and I think they'll still capture a lot of lion's share of volume because of their brand and whatnot. So. Yeah, and then expansion to other protocols.
01:26:45.936 - 01:28:20.860, Speaker B: So this one was, you know, another one where, you know, Frax has kind of, like, telegraphed that they would be adopting a curve as kind of like, their marketplace incentive, marketplace model. And, you know, fracs alone, it's also like a billion dollar protocol. So this is more of an example of, like, okay, convex's business is actually creating liquid markets for these marketplaces for these kind of like, vote escrow, like, tiered vote escrow type of tokenomics models, there are more and more of these type of models that are coming out because curve has kind of started proving that, you know, that is kind of one of the best practices. So it stands to reason, like, you know, more and more protocols can potentially leverage, you know, convex from like a b two b standpoint to kind of create incentive marketplaces for their own protocol as well. Similar to what Frax is doing. So, you know, the TLDR is, you know, Frax is going to introduce like another revenue stream for convex, right? So convex is not entirely dependent on just the curve ecosystem. As more and more marketplaces start adopting convex as their b two b solution, then we can potentially see additional price action from that.
01:28:20.860 - 01:29:22.030, Speaker B: Those are some of the near term catalysts. And I think from the discord, like, a lot of people ask, you know, like, how should I play convex? Like, should I be staking convex, locking convex, you know, staking CVX curve, et cetera, et cetera. I think ultimately, you know, I would look at it from what is the time horizon that you're thinking of putting your money in? I think if your time horizon is like longer than four weeks and you're willing to, like, lock, I think, you know, convex is definitely like more of like, the higher ev play. Um, I think curve is definitely like more of a worker token in the sense that, uh, over time, your. Your token's actually going to diminish in value versus, uh, increasing in value, potentially. Um, like, one curve is always going to be one curve. One convex is going to be worth more and more curve, um, over time.
01:29:22.030 - 01:30:23.748, Speaker B: Uh, and then the other big question that people ask is, um, you know, how much do I need to start? Um, and that's a question I can't really answer for people. Uh, but just know that if you were to stake or not stake, but like, buy approve lock, um, you know, you're easily, like, let's say gas is like, you know, 75 to 100. You're easily going to spend three to $400 on, you know, just setting up your position. So if you ask me, like, is $1,000 good to start? Probably not, because that's going to be, you know, 30% to 40% of your buy in. Um, you know, if you can get like, low gas, you can probably start your stake, um, or start your lock position with like $150, um, you know, so. So I would say, like, at least, you know, at least five figures. I would probably do like at least like, you know, twenty five k to fifty k, at least just that range.
01:30:23.748 - 01:30:53.960, Speaker B: Just because like, you don't want your, your stuff to be eaten into, but if you're not thinking about, like, you know, five figures, then. Then you're really just accumulating CVX and not really, like, doing the transactions and whatnot. And you can, you know, there are a lot of other community members that can figure out ways of finding how to get CVX without paying the fees, like, through exchanges and whatnot. But, like, typically, I use mostly defi. So, like, I'm not the best subject matter expert on in that respect, so.
01:30:56.420 - 01:31:30.510, Speaker A: Yeah, well, thank you for this. I don't even know how long this video is, but it's going to be a long one. Yeah, I think before the call, I mentioned that I was like, 75% there in terms of, like, going gigaboltard. I think I'm like, 90% there now. Yeah. In the last, like, 20 minutes, I was, like, contemplating, like, well, how do I buy CB's? Like, do I sell my, do I sell myself? Do I just use my staples? Yeah, yeah, but, yeah, it's just like, I mean, it's a question I have to ask myself.
01:31:30.670 - 01:31:50.864, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can farm it. You can, you know, buy it. You can market buy it. There are a lot of different ways to accumulate. So, um, I think that's up to, you know, people to figure out themselves in terms of, like, how they can approach it. But, uh, from a fundamental standpoint, I think, you know, convex, you know, assuming that curve curve still has a dominance.
01:31:50.864 - 01:31:58.740, Speaker B: And, you know, convex team executes, I think it's quite an interesting play from, uh, from an investment standpoint, so.
01:31:59.120 - 01:32:02.792, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Anyways, uh, let's wrap the video there.
01:32:02.856 - 01:32:04.150, Speaker B: Um, cool.
01:32:04.730 - 01:32:18.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I really appreciate you taking your time. Chaos, you know, he's a humble moderator if anyone has questions. Well, first of all, watch this video first before asking any questions.
01:32:18.330 - 01:32:18.922, Speaker B: Yes, please.
01:32:18.986 - 01:32:40.612, Speaker A: So just so, like, the conversations on that channel can be more constructive. Yeah, but, you know, like, I'll probably be more active, you know, in the future. Right. I just haven't had the chance to, like, dive this deep into it just because I, like, you know, I have to do other research. Yep. But, you know, I'm definitely getting there.
01:32:40.756 - 01:32:43.156, Speaker B: No worries. A lot of fun. So.
01:32:43.228 - 01:32:49.788, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you have any parting words for our members? Words of wisdom or any additional alpha or something?
01:32:49.884 - 01:32:53.460, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm a humble farmer just like everyone else, so.
01:32:53.620 - 01:33:07.956, Speaker A: Yeah, this. Yeah, the humble farmer. Yeah. Okay, awesome. Yeah, I think convex is right in line, right on brand with the humble former mindset. It's like, no, it's not going to give you a ten x overnight. But, you know, you just build conviction.
01:33:07.956 - 01:33:13.340, Speaker A: You believe in the yield, you believe in the fundamentals, and you just. You ape, you know?
01:33:13.460 - 01:33:17.580, Speaker B: Yep. Yep. All right, thanks, taki. Appreciate it. Later.
