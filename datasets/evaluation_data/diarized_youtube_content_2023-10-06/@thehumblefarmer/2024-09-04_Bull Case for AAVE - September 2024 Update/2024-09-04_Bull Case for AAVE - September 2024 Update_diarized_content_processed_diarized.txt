00:00:00.720 - 00:00:31.750, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Tyke here. And in this video I wanted to give an update to my Aave thesis. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord. The link will be in the description below. So last month or late July, I essentially said, hey, I bought some aave at $92 and I'm gonna be staking it. And I also mentioned that I think Aave eat has bottomed. And this is important because, you know, not only is ETH underperforming, right, but if you're holding an altcoin that's underperforming eiddeh, then that's a nightmare, right? You're taking on so much risk and you're underperforming Eat, which seems like a cooked asset for now.
00:00:31.750 - 00:01:01.002, Speaker A: And at the date of recording last month, it was roughly at 0.028. And right now it's sitting at roughly 0.05,390.054, let's say. So we've essentially two x. And I think this is important because Ave, if you look at this, I mean, ratio, we've kind of been going down only, right? Lower lows, lower highs for essentially three years. And the fact that we seem to be finally putting in a higher high, of course, you know, it's not confirmed yet, but it seems like we are putting in a higher high. And perhaps, you know, this level can be resistance.
00:01:01.002 - 00:01:38.170, Speaker A: Maybe we're going to put in like, you know, an inverse head and shoulders or something. Honestly, I don't really know what's going to happen in the short term, but I think the macro trend, the overall trend is going to be up for the Aave Eid ratio. And for that reason, I think Aave USD becomes more of an attractive investment. So what did I think avait was going to bottom. And, you know, I've been calling for this defi renaissance, right. It seems like people are, have gone way too, you know, are like way too one sided on like one side of the pendulum where they're just like buying meme coins, saying everything else is worthless. But maybe, right, we can go back from financial nihilism to fundamentals.
00:01:38.170 - 00:02:15.916, Speaker A: It seems like people are getting jaded. People want to believe in something, I want to believe in something. And I think Aave is one of those things that I think people can actually, you know, make a bull case for. But of course, the reason I thought, you know, Ava ETH is bottomed kind of goes back to my analysis of Maker ETH last year. So back in July of 2023, I said that, hey, I think maker has bottomed. And the reason maker did bottom against ETH is because of their buyback proposal, essentially saying, hey, like, we have a bunch of money, we're going to start buying back the token. So this was July of last year, and, you know, this was basically like back, like around here, right? And since then make REIT essentially bottomed.
00:02:15.916 - 00:03:04.672, Speaker A: And it's a basically two x, and at the peak, it was roughly over a little bit over three x. So for the same reason, I just think that for most of these valueless governance tokens, they are valueless and worthless until they're not. And I just think that once there's some timeline or some hope for value accrual, I think people are going to find reasons to make a bull case for these types of assets. Of course, if you're as deep into defi as me, I can front run these flows because I know all these governance proposals. I know when they're going to happen roughly, and that's essentially the bull case I came or I laid out in late July. Of course, a lot of things have happened since late July, for example. I mean, you know, I mean, I guess looking at ETH, right, I mean, since July 30, I mean, this eth, right, really painful since.
00:03:04.672 - 00:03:45.080, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been down only it's been pretty bad. But I also think that this kind of highlights, I guess, that Lindy effects and the strength of things like Aave, for example. Stani, who is the founder of Aave, mentioned that in the early August liquidations, Aave treasury was rewarded with $6 million in revenue because whenever people get liquidated on Aave, Aave charges a small fee. And of course, eventually the $6 million is going to go into buybacks. And I think this is what's important. It's easy to punt meme coins or punt some random new coin because, oh, it's shiny and new. You know, rates are still high.
00:03:45.080 - 00:04:28.026, Speaker A: I think people have a higher bar, a higher standard for allocating into altcoins. So seeing metrics like this, which will eventually go into buybacks, I think forms a bigger bull case for this type of asset. And the timeline for the Aave buybacks are still unclear. So this is coming from the buyback proposal that was laid out in late July. But essentially what needs to happen is first they go stablecoin to reach $175 million in supply or market cap, and then secondary liquidity to allow a $10 million swap size at 1% or less price impact. And also essentially, their economics have to improve. So these are essentially the three points that needs to happen.
00:04:28.026 - 00:04:42.750, Speaker A: But I think .3 has already happened. I mean, they just made $6 million a month ago. The treasury has roughly $70 million. I think that's fine. It's more. So tracking the gold market cap, and once gold market cap hits 175, I think things are really going to get rolling.
00:04:42.750 - 00:05:15.986, Speaker A: And last month, it was sitting at roughly a little bit over 100. And right now, at the date of recording, we're roughly at 126. I think this growth is pretty interesting also, because go is going to be one of their profit drivers. Whenever you lend and borrow USDC, Aave doesn't make that much money. But if Aave has their own stable coin and they can charge their own borrower rate, like, let's say, ranging from 5% to 10%, that's all going to be revenue going to the Dow. So right now, the growth of go is being subsidized. So Aave has a bunch of money in the treasury.
00:05:15.986 - 00:06:00.542, Speaker A: They're paying people to stake go. So it's not completely sustainable. But I think over time, they're going to way to figure out ways to create demand for go, build out liquidity. And I think this growth is very impressive because if you look at other, let's say, decentralized, stable coins, if you have curb USDA, basically just like losing market share, people are just not willing to hold onto the risk and even die. I mean, I laid out the bull case last year and whatnot, but if Dai is not growing, then it's kind of hard to be optimistic maker. And we also see other things happening in the ecosystem. I also laid out that when it comes to money markets, Aave is essentially a bank.
00:06:00.542 - 00:06:45.980, Speaker A: And when you're using a bank, you're essentially putting in your entire deposit, right? You want to borrow against bitcoin, eat like, whatever. You just put like 100k with bitcoin, borrow fifty k of USDC. But like, what's the capital at risk? The bitcoin. So if you're depositing money into a bank, you have to be able to trust that bank. And we've kind of seen since, I mean, ever since the dawn of time, right, Aave has continued to grow in market share, right? It's the green box or this green shaded area here. And I really wouldn't be surprised if Aave has, let's say, 70, 80, 90% market share by sometime mid to late 2025. And also, right, it's like, sure, there can be points, programs and new tokens, but are you really going to be risking your entire deposit for, let's say, 5%, 10% more yield.
00:06:45.980 - 00:07:31.106, Speaker A: I don't really think it makes sense. Just use Aave. So I think this lengthiness is important. And we also see this where when it comes to partnerships, people don't want to partner with compound or morpho or anything, right? Even though I'm sure they have partners, and they will have partners, but, you know, the big, the big guys, they're gonna partner with Avi, for example, maker, they're gonna rebrand to sky, which is a whole other topic that I'm not really gonna get into. But of course, if you're creating a stable coin, you need to be on Aave, right, because that's where all the capital is. So, you know, sky is essentially, or maker, right? Formerly Maker is essentially saying, hey, you know, if you integrate USDs, which is the new version of Dai, right, they're just rebranding the entire thing. We're going to just incentivize it.
00:07:31.106 - 00:08:44.120, Speaker A: So if you have usds and you're putting into Aave, then Maker sky will give you more tokens, which is good, right. Aave is going to utilize external incentives to drive TVL growth and profitability for their own DAO. We also saw Avia Labs proposing to integrate the stability module with BlackRock's biddle fund, right? So this is like tokenized Treasury RDB fund. And essentially, you know, BlackRock essentially has like half a billion dollars, I believe, in treasuries and stable coins, and Avi wants to partner with them. And, you know, like, thinking realistically, is Blackrock going to partner with Aave or some the 60th version of like a money market fork or Aave fork that no one's heard of with like a $10 million market cap with like $500 million FDV, right? Like, definitely not. And even yesterday, there was this proposal of this Trump Defi project where the founders are linked to some project called Doe Finance, which had a $2 million DeFi hack. I mean, it's not a great look, it seems like a really low effort project where the Trump family seems to be trying to, I guess, make themselves look better against the Defi community, crypto community, which is fine.
00:08:44.120 - 00:09:07.916, Speaker A: At least they're trying something. You can't say that for other politicians, whatnot. And apparently this is being built on Ethereum and Aave. So on first thought, I thought they're gonna be forking Aave, right? So, like, fork Aave, drop a token on top and then, you know, like, let like, pump the token or something. But apparently so. I mean, I could be wrong. We don't really have the white paper yet, but apparently it's a front end for Aave.
00:09:07.916 - 00:09:37.700, Speaker A: So if you go to this world of liberty finance or whatever this thing is called, and you deposit, like, $100,000 worth of eth, it's, you know, it's $100,000 of eth on their front end, but the capital is actually going through Aave, right? So it's. I guess. I guess it's good for them, right? Because, you know, if they fork something, then they can mess it up. But if they. If they just make a front end for Aave, then, you know, they can't really mess up, right? And then you put up. Then you put the token on top, charge fees or something. I'm sure, you know, people are going to try to pump it and whatnot.
00:09:37.700 - 00:10:24.332, Speaker A: I mean, it's not bearish Ave, right? I mean, it's incrementally bullish Ave. So I guess I'm all for it, right? I mean, this was certainly not on my bingo card, right? But I guess, I mean, the point is, right, it's like, it doesn't really matter that Trump is, like, you know, creating this new DeFi project, right. Because this is not going to succeed, right? I mean, who knows? Maybe at some point it'll succeed. It'll succeed in the short term, but, you know, people are eventually going to be like, you know what? Like. Like, why does this thing have any value unless he, like, borrows against his hotels or something? But the point is Aave, right, if you're partnering with the lending protocol, if you're putting sizable deposits into a bank, just use Aave. It makes no sense. And I just think it's interesting because I think Aave is a good bet on, I guess, defi growing.
00:10:24.332 - 00:11:05.214, Speaker A: Just, you know, making a bet that if Defi TvL grows, then Aave TvL will grow. And if Aave market share grows relative to other lending markets, then, you know, they essentially. They're essentially going to have a monopoly on the entire money market space. And what premium do you put on that? I have no idea. I honestly have no idea what the upside for things like Aave is right now. It's like, at 132, there's been a lot of volatility, right? But if you, you know, I mean, just think about it, right? I mean, since late July, the markets have nuked, whereas aave is up. And you can see this in the Aave ETH and Aave bitcoin ratios kind of going over here, Aave is going up, and then Aave bitcoin.
00:11:05.214 - 00:11:26.826, Speaker A: Right. Bitcoin's been stronger than ETH, so obviously we haven't put in higher highs than here. But I think once we get, let's say, get above 0.020.0027, I just think the market is going to start to appreciate the fact that Aave probably has bottomed against ETH, probably bottoming as bitcoin. Okay. How much upside does it have? I have no idea. Right.
00:11:26.826 - 00:12:11.340, Speaker A: I'm not here to bring price targets and whatnot, but as the most Lindy, as the most valuable bank in all of defi, all of crypto, I don't think it's infeasible for this thing to hit all time highs. So that's kind of the case. I'm leaning out, and I've been saying that, hey, I believe in this defi renaissance. I think the entire crypto industry has gone way too one sided into meme coins, and everything is worthless. Let's just buy scams, let's promote scams, and if I make money from a scam, it's okay. That's not really the world I want to live in. So I guess my goal here is, hey, everyone thinks these defi tokens are worthless.
00:12:11.340 - 00:12:47.372, Speaker A: I'll take the other side of that. I think 99% of these tokens are worthless, but the 1% that are worth something, I think they can have a renaissance. They can have their day in the sun, and, you know, it's like, you know, maybe I'll buy other defi coins, too. And I actually bought another defi coin today, which I'm, you know, it's more of like a shorter to medium term, actually. You know, it kind of depends the thesis still being laid out, but if you want to know what that is, make sure to check out the premier discord. I share a lot of my theses on, you know, other coins. I also share premium videos three times a week.
00:12:47.372 - 00:13:02.388, Speaker A: You know, it's. I think it's one of the better Defi communities out there, essentially. You know, if you. Defi is a lot of work, right? So just let me do all the research for you so you can focus on what you do best. That's kind of. That's kind of the pitch. And also, you know, I highly suggest people listen to this.
00:13:02.388 - 00:13:54.236, Speaker A: So I posted this roughly a week ago, and I had Arthur zero x kind of talk about the poll case for Aave and whether things like Lido is investable, Uniswap is investable, maker is investable, defects of rate cuts on Defi, the Perpetex landscape, you know, the vital, the whole Vitalik, you know, saga, right? You know, he doesn't like Defi. You know, with like my podcast, I want like study lines and whatnot. So on defi, right. Why Jupyter is kind of interesting. So I think this was kind of like a masterclass on the current defi landscape. So I highly suggest everyone check this out and to wrap up the video. Like, my general view is that, you know, I think generally the market has, it's pretty clear that there are certain winners in the market, right? You know, like Uniswap, probably the number one dex aave, number one lending market.
00:13:54.236 - 00:14:12.718, Speaker A: And it's going to be really difficult for any new project to flip them. So I think it makes sense to bet on category leaders, essentially. That's kind of like the view that I have. And, you know, Ave is one of them. So anyways, thank you guys for watching. Hopefully you guys enjoyed the video. You know, hopefully Avey does well, right? I'm kind of betting on it all.
00:14:12.718 - 00:14:20.878, Speaker A: My Ave is staked. I haven't sold a single ave. And who knows, maybe I'll buy more, right? If I happen to get some airdrop stimulus. Thanks for watching. See you guys another time. Bye.
