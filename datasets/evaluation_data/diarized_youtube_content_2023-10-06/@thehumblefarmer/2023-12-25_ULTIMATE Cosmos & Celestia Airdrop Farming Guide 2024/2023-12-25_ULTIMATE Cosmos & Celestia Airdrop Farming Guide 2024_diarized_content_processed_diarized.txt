00:00:03.320 - 00:00:23.894, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And for this week's version of farmers of the week, I wanted to get an expert on the cosmos ecosystem. And who better to get on than crypto Seto. He has my favorite, you know, personally, my favorite channel when it comes to the cosmos ecosystem. All he talks about is Cosmos. He is the face of Cosmos. He even organizes events and whatnot.
00:00:23.894 - 00:00:28.210, Speaker A: So, crypto Cedar, how are you doing today? Yeah, how are you doing today?
00:00:28.870 - 00:00:48.650, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for the warm welcome and kind words. It's good, man. Yeah, I mean, cosmos in the past couple of weeks has gained some momentum. You know, obviously, coin prices going up is always makes people in crypto happy in general. So, yeah, that's no different in cosmos. And, yeah, I'm glad to be here and talk with you about cosmos.
00:00:49.030 - 00:01:03.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. People see prices go up and they're suddenly interested in crypto. You know, how funny how that works. But anyways, do you want to first give us your background? How did you join Crypto and how did you join the Cosmos ecosystem? How did you get here? And why are you bullish cosmos?
00:01:04.770 - 00:01:47.938, Speaker B: Yeah, I discovered Cosmos in late 2020 just randomly because I had some atom in my wallet and I never knew why I bought them and what they do. So I made a tweet, and Jack Sempolin, who is one of the core engineers, responded, and he offered to walk me through what Cosmos and IBC and the Internet of blockchain is at that time. Right. This was before IBC even went live. And he said one thing that really got me hooked, which was that with the launch of IBC, the original Cosmos whitepaper is essentially shipped. And when I heard it, I was like, this is not like crypto is just fairy tales, visions that will never be reached. Right.
00:01:47.938 - 00:02:31.984, Speaker B: So this was something that got me intrigued. And then I went down the rabbit hole. And obviously, as I started, also when I met Jack, I think I was already doing YouTube for seven, eight months. But when I then got into Cosmos and IBC went live, Osmosis launched, Juno launched, Stargaze launched, all these chains went live. I just interviewed all these founders and builders. So my channel became kind of like a public learning platform for myself and then with that, also for my audience, and it kind of grew in audience and, yeah, helped a lot of cosmonauts to learn about the specifics and the flavors in cosmos. But before I got into Cosmos, I was already in crypto for three or four years.
00:02:31.984 - 00:03:12.540, Speaker B: Late or early 2017, I got into it. And, yeah, I think I'm just fundamentally committed to the industry, to the space, to the technology. Even though I don't have a technological background, I think for me, it's extra hard to understand what is actually different layers and modularity, data availability. For me to really understand this is super hard because I don't have a technical background, but that's really what I do. Just public learning and sharing strategies specifically around add robs, which we're going to be talking about today a lot, because there's a lot that's going on in Cosmos. That's the TLDR.
00:03:13.120 - 00:04:00.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember last cycle, which is 2020, 2021, we had Atom stakers receive all these airdrops, and we'll talk about airdrops later. But selfishly, I've been diving deeper into the cosmos ecosystem recently, and I do have some questions on a fundamental basis. I know you have a Google Doc or some document that feel free to share right now, but I feel like one problem within the cosmos ecosystem that I observe is that there's too many chains. Right? Like, and there's no shelling point for, like, a token that the community can rally around. Do people rally around Adam, do Tia, Osmo, what's your view on, I guess, like, the politics around the cosmos ecosystem right now? And how does it get better?
00:04:01.190 - 00:04:50.422, Speaker B: Yeah, it's true. I mean, in most ecosystems, you have this fat protocol thesis, right? Where you have one base layer that accrues and absorbs all of the value that kind of aligns the community, the developers and everything, right? On Ethereum, it's eth, and Solana, it's Sol, avalanche, it's avax. All subnets on avalanche accrue value to Avax and Cosmos is fundamentally different. And in fact, it's something that people have oftentimes criticized. But it's always been an intention design decision from the beginning to not pack IBC, adoption or growth to a chain, right? So the common ground and the whole shelling point in customers is, in fact, IBC. But IBC is not something you can buy. It's not something you can invest in.
00:04:50.422 - 00:05:20.678, Speaker B: Right? It doesn't have a token. It doesn't have a chain. It's agnostic. Right? It resides on atom as much as it resides on, I don't know, on osmosis and stargaze and Juno and all other chains, right? So it's really, this is the common ground. But what you see now, especially post terra collapse, you saw a lot of drama in cosmos, which you always see. You see a lot of teams coming out or joining Cosmos, but not necessarily bragging about it. Right.
00:05:20.678 - 00:06:04.178, Speaker B: So Dydx, for example, when they migrated to launch their cosmos chain, they were not going out there like, we're customers now. We're, you know, we're part of the firm to a degree. They did, like small degree. But I don't think that's something that most projects nowadays are using as the pr or kind of marketing gig. So I think customers, and that's really also the power of cosmos at the same time, because cosmos is really an ecosystem of sovereign and interoperable chains. And I think the sovereignty aspect really is what makes it so powerful and so resilient. So to answer your question, there isn't really one common ground and token that aligns everything.
00:06:04.178 - 00:06:46.054, Speaker B: There isn't really that shelling point. It's rather IBC, which you can't buy. But Atom still today is kind of this voluntary shelling point. And I think now the community also wants to shape it more into a form of interchange money or interchange capital, which would make atom kind of this predominant liquidity gate and asset across all IBC chains, or most of them. And also atom, I think, historically, has always been a great asset to hold and stake to bootstrap and obviously also get airdrops for other chains. Right. Osmosis, Juno, more recently, Tia, all these coins have been dropped to atom stakers.
00:06:46.054 - 00:07:19.914, Speaker B: So I think atom would probably be the closest. But like I said, now you have this new generation of coins, like Celestia itself, that originated out of atom, but it is now having its own ecosystem. And it's actually, by fully diluted market cap, bigger than atom, I think three times bigger. Injective just flipped atom recently. Right. So you have this ecosystem growth of sovereign ecosystems, and. Yeah, atom, I think, is a voluntary shelling point, but not really a like dependency for the rest of the IBC gang.
00:07:19.914 - 00:07:32.870, Speaker B: So it's a hard question to answer straightforward. But I think that's also the design intention of cosmos, to not have one shelling point on which everything depends on.
00:07:33.930 - 00:08:06.790, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. That makes sense. I feel like another problem that I've observed in the cosmos ecosystem, aside from just having too many chains and not knowing which one is which is fragmented liquidity. So I personally tried to bridge to Cosmos using the gravity bridge, and the experience is okay. And there's different places where liquidity lies. First of all, there's osmosis. I think osmosis has 200 million tbl, something along those lines, and also astroport.
00:08:06.790 - 00:08:42.890, Speaker A: I think they have $50 to $100 million in TVL. And I think one issue that Cosmos has is that it's very difficult to get liquidity from ethereum to migrate to cosmos because of all these loops you have to jump through and whatnot. I think neutron, the chain, is trying to bring wrapped staked ETH from Ethereum mainnet to cosmos. And I think the neutron team formally worked with Lido, or was part of Lido. How do you think liquidity gets to the cosmos ecosystem? Because ultimately that's what's needed to, I guess, bring more users, right?
00:08:43.230 - 00:09:08.546, Speaker B: Yeah. So what happened in the bear market and more recently, like, in the past five months, is that we had the launches of native USDC circle USDC, as well as native USDT from tether. USDC launched on Noble. So they actually built their own chain for that, a native asset issuance chain. That chain is already live. There's $53 million worth of USDC right now. On Noble.
00:09:08.546 - 00:09:55.944, Speaker B: I think it just surpassed optimism with that number. And on Kava, which is the home of native USDT, I think you have over $160 million. So now you have these two native stablecoins in Cosmos, which I think is a big liquidity gateway. I know the osmosis team has been working very hard to get assets like Ethereum and also bitcoin into osmosis in different forms. I think bitcoin is launching their red BTC on osmosis directly, and nomic is a team that brings native BTC to osmosis as well. So this is kind of rolling out right now. And, yeah, then you have the accelerators of the world.
00:09:55.944 - 00:10:39.998, Speaker B: I think you also have now this next generation of user experience in cosmos with IBC fun or squid router, which is also powered by Axela technology. Because I agree. I think one of the bigger bottlenecks of this whole app change thesis, which means you have all these different l one s and then IBC in between. Is that mostly. For now, the whole IBC magic was manually done by the user. But I think in the future, it should be all pushed in the background so that you don't really care or you don't even need to care. Which chain are you on? Where's the liquidity it needs to through? And that's actually what IBC can do, as far as I understand, is that IBC can tap into all of that in the background.
00:10:39.998 - 00:11:10.060, Speaker B: Right. And then just with a few clicks, a user can just do transactions on any chain anytime, hopefully also soon outside of Cosmos native chains, which means IBC going to Ethereum, going to Solana, going to avalanche, so that you can also tap in. Directly into liquidity from there. But this is work in progress, and I think the whole ux around it also needs to improve. But like I said, I think this is all happening as we speak.
00:11:10.640 - 00:11:38.660, Speaker A: Got it. And I know our viewers, they care more about airdrops, whatnot. But like I mentioned, I'm just curious. I don't want to hear from the cosmos expert here. And one of the reasons I've started to look more into the cosmos ecosystem is because recently we've seen a surge in the price of Solana. It's currently close to $100. And I think what that does to the collective market is it forces participants to become more open minded.
00:11:38.660 - 00:12:07.334, Speaker A: Because I think in the bear market, and I'm guilty of this, but I thought that ethereum would just be the chain, and there's going to be liquidity modes, and most of these alt l ones, they might fade into irrelevance. But Solana, it's back. And my first thought was, well, Solana did well because everyone thought it was dead, but it's not dead. And then my mind went to, well, Cosmos, we have all these amazing teams building there. It's not dead. There's a clash. Osmosis, all these chains.
00:12:07.334 - 00:12:38.088, Speaker A: Celestia is a big one. And I think the cosmos ecosystem has a lot of potential for a renaissance in 2024. And for that reason, I think the tokens there could be worth airdrop farming. So that's kind of where I want to pivot the conversation into. And we had Celestia, which was a huge airdrop. I was a little bit salty because I was eligible, but I couldn't blame it because I'm geoblocked. And then it just pumped six x, and I was like, oh, my God.
00:12:38.088 - 00:13:01.000, Speaker A: And then I literally just bought recently because I was like, okay, I have to just gain exposure to this ecosystem. Do you mind sharing the doc that you prepared for us and just going through, I guess, the airdrop of farming opportunities? I guess certain narratives that you're excited for, certain tokens you're excited for, and just all that jazz.
00:13:01.500 - 00:13:05.156, Speaker B: Yeah, there we go.
00:13:05.348 - 00:13:06.280, Speaker A: There you go.
00:13:06.780 - 00:13:35.530, Speaker B: Yeah. I think we can maybe start off with before we get into Celestia. I think that's a big one. But I think. Sorry. Yeah, I think maybe we can start with more general stuff and, like, airdrops that might come in the cosmos ecosystem. I think the first narrative that might be hot for 2024 is the narrative around the atom economic zone.
00:13:35.530 - 00:14:21.000, Speaker B: Atom economic zone basically means that the cosmos hub, which is a chain on which atom resides can now do shared security similar to how the Polkadot relay chain does it with their parachains. So you have now the creation of this alignment with new chains that rent security from atom and some of which also do airdrops. Neutron, you mentioned earlier, astroport primarily deploys there. Neutron launch with an airdrop for atom stakers. Neutron, like I said, is from the Lido team. I think that's one to keep an eye on. And I also think on top of Neutron, you're going to see a lot of applications, a lot of tokens, a lot of projects that are going to launch.
00:14:21.000 - 00:14:59.830, Speaker B: I think Neutron is definitely a DeFi platform that could also be serious competition to the osmosis and the injectives and the, the Kujiras out there. Then you have stride, which is the second already. So neutrons are alive. Stride is also live already as atom secured chains. And Stride is a liquid staking protocol that has currently around $90 million in TVL. And they have an ongoing airdrop right now. So if you're a farmer and you want airdrops and you've been staking some atom, you most likely get this STRD airdrop.
00:14:59.830 - 00:15:55.850, Speaker B: And I also got fresh new alpha from the team, which is that they are going to add ST Dydx next, which means you also get an airdrop for STRD if you hold or stake any DyDX tokens. So that's how they do their airdrop. They really give out an airdrop to every new token or coin that they're adding to their liquid staking protocol. There's already ten that are live, also injective and Somalia and Osmo. So if you had any of these coins, you should head over to I think it's app stride zone. And then there's an airdrops tab where you can claim this. So I think, yeah, this is maybe to start with and just to make it complete here, noble chain I mentioned earlier for native USDC, they are third in line to join the atom economic zone.
00:15:55.850 - 00:16:17.810, Speaker B: This is not confirmed yet. And they also don't have a token right now. I think they're still considering because they need to figure out economics. I don't think they will launch a token because circle is involved. There's regulatory issues. I think that's the route they don't want to take. But noble definitely also want to, to watch out for.
00:16:17.850 - 00:16:28.010, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And when you say adam economic zone, are these consumer chains for Adam is all three ok. Ok. Neutron and stride.
00:16:28.170 - 00:16:34.322, Speaker B: Are the only ones right now. The first two and noble is the third one that might be joining.
00:16:34.506 - 00:17:09.334, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to refresh my. I guess understanding of consumer chains is instead of neutron having its own validator set and stakers, it can rent security from the atom stakers like the validators. This can also create more value for Adam because you can stake atom to secure the atom. And then also you can also help secure neutron and then neutron will pay you tokens like NTrN tokens if you stake out. Is that okay? Sounds good. So with more consumer chains, more value.
00:17:09.334 - 00:17:12.810, Speaker A: Cool, potentially for adam, is that like a good way to think about it?
00:17:13.999 - 00:17:42.518, Speaker B: Yes and no. I mean, right now neutron is brand new. Stride is brand new. Neutron shares 25% revenue with atom stakers, but the volumes are still very low, which means right now it's still negligible. Stride shares 15%, but same story here. So I think there is a revenue accrual mechanism, but it's still super low. But like I said, both of them also did airdrops to the atom stakeholder community.
00:17:42.518 - 00:18:28.770, Speaker B: Neutron did a 7% Genesis airdrop for the atom community. And the rest of the unclaimed airdrop they actually sent back to the cosmos sub treasury, which is currently worth like $45 million or something like that. So this is kind of the value accrual. But I think moving forward, we need more resilient and sustainable economics because the way it works is not like in Polkadot. Like in Polkadot they had this parachain slot auction model where there was literally a bidding process. And that's kind of, you know, like you have literal dollar value for a slot here. It's more like an on chain governance process and an actual business plan behind which is a bit more complex and not as predictable in terms of how does it accrue revenue.
00:18:28.770 - 00:18:39.510, Speaker B: But yeah, it just launched. You know, we're going to see how it works. But that's basically how it works. Yeah. So it would technically accrue value for atom just now. It's still quite low.
00:18:40.170 - 00:18:51.042, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, well, that's a potential narrative to keep an eye on. It could be hot next year if there's more consumer chains. Can you scroll down a little just to get to the next topic? I know you have a bunch. Okay.
00:18:51.106 - 00:18:51.394, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:51.442 - 00:18:59.670, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. This is more in my camp because this is mostly a Defi channel. Yeah, exactly.
00:19:01.810 - 00:19:41.300, Speaker B: Like I explained earlier, I think this native stable coin liquidity injection through USDC and USDT plus we also have a new generation of algorithmic. I know that's like everyone still probably has PTSD from that word. But this decentralized stablecoins over collateralized. There's Usk on Kojira, there's IST on agaric silk from shade protocol. So you have these different kind of stablecoin experiments and native centralized ones. Plus you also have battle tested Defi platforms. And you see, like you said earlier, you saw Solana just reviving.
00:19:41.300 - 00:20:34.796, Speaker B: We also have projects in cosmos such as injective that have been around in the last bull run, kava has been around, osmosis has been around. So you see these og bear market survivors that already injective has just gone on a crazy run. So I think we're going to see a Defi summer, number one. Number two, I also think, because all of these are in fact layer one blockchains, except for neutron, which is atom secured. So that's kind of like an l two in that sense, on atom, but all the rest are l one s. And if you look at something like injective, they have their own application environment, they have helix, they have, I forgot the other one, black punter or something like it's called. They have filament coming up, which is a perp stacks.
00:20:34.796 - 00:20:55.048, Speaker B: So they have their own ecosystem coming up. And most of these projects will also launch tokens, right? Especially now if you enter a bull run. Everyone loves tokens in a bull run. We hate tokens in a bear market. We love tokens in a bull run. So you're going to see a token for everything. And I think injective might actually be in this category, similar to Kujira.
00:20:55.048 - 00:21:36.060, Speaker B: I think Kuji and injective might be two native coins that are worth to stake and where it's worth to kind of participate, do some trades, maybe LP use the Kujira liquidation, what's it called? The liquidation engine. Use that. Just play around with it, because I think there's going to be an airdrop season in those ecosystems. Osmosis, there's constantly airdrops. Levana launched on osmosis. If you used Levana on osmosis, you got the Pyth airdrop, which was also quite nice. I think this is a big category, defi.
00:21:36.060 - 00:22:05.874, Speaker B: And yeah, I think there's a longer list than that. Those are just notes I took. But there's definitely ecosystems where it makes sense to do some research and see what are the top applications. Do they have tokens yet? Has the team said anything on injective? There's a couple of teams that already came out and said, yeah, we will do an airdrop, but without eligibility criteria. Yet I think same for, say, that's a newer chain, obviously, but, yeah, I.
00:22:05.882 - 00:22:38.180, Speaker A: Think that's just to interrupt. I know injective is the first l one token to just blast past all time highs. Do you think that part of it is because there's some of the supply that just like being staked because people expect, hey, if I stake injective, I'm going to get tokens or I'll get airdrop tokens of all these injective DeFi platforms that launch. And maybe injective stakers get other airdrops from other ecosystems. Is that kind of the community's mindset? I suppose.
00:22:39.400 - 00:23:09.030, Speaker B: I think that's the case now after it did like a 30 x. But I think, yeah, because also you have to think now, like, adrobes aren't only big if the market cap is big. Right. An injective at a $3 billion market cap is much more interesting for big airdrops than injective at a $200 million market cap. Right. So I think injective the run up from $1 to 30 or $40.42 I think yesterday.
00:23:09.030 - 00:23:56.654, Speaker B: They have a strong bd network, they have a strong vc backing, they have access to large amounts of capital, market makers, and they also have their own native application with Helix, which is actually an order book Dex that can also do perpetuals, that can also do pre token launches. Tia was trading on Helix, I think, first before anywhere. That helped. And I think now you see people, the retail people, because I think objective was never really too much retail oriented, but I think now after the run, everyone on Twitter is talking about it, which makes it interesting for airdrops. Right. So I think it's like, first a pump, now the community chasing the airdrops.
00:23:56.742 - 00:24:10.250, Speaker A: Yeah. This is what I like to call green candle marketing. Once you have green candles, that's the best form of marketing and. Yeah, okay, that's cool. Okay. We'll try to combine everything at the end, but let's go to the next section. Okay.
00:24:10.250 - 00:24:11.890, Speaker A: What do you think about it?
00:24:12.470 - 00:24:24.078, Speaker B: This, I think, is an interesting category, which is this IBC everywhere category. And like I said, I think we're now at a point where cosmos is kind of branching out of its own home.
00:24:24.254 - 00:24:36.970, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, let me just interrupt. I feel like we've talked about IBC, but I don't think we've defined it. Can you briefly summarize inter blockchain communications just so that our audience has a background IBC.
00:24:37.010 - 00:25:22.650, Speaker B: Inter blockchain communication is basically an interoperability standard. That's home to Cosmos that launched two and a half years ago, and it's now connecting 70 chains. It's actually natively baked into any kind of Cosmos SDK change out of the box. But most chains that you see that are kind of cosmos chains are built on the Cosmos SDK. But moving forward, I believe that we will see, and this is already happening, right? That we will see IBC compatibility to Solana to Ethereum. Polkadot is already live, actually, by the team from Picaso network. So you really see IBC branching out.
00:25:22.650 - 00:26:03.750, Speaker B: And those really are the projects that are working on this. On this list here, only Picaso and Corium are live right now in terms of their tokens. Those in the middle, they don't have tokens yet. Union actually just announced an airdrop also for T's stakers. So this is going to be landslide. Network is actually going to make IBC compatible to avalanche. I am pretty sure that they will also do an airdrop, maybe more for Atom stakers, I don't think, for T's stakers, but I think this also makes sense to roll out their token.
00:26:03.750 - 00:26:43.950, Speaker B: I think that's going to be a hot narrative as well. IBC everywhere. PCA is right now leading the market there, and Picaso actually is home to Polkadot or Kusama. So Picasso is actually a Kusama parachain. And they are also still going to launch their Polkadot parachain because Polkadot has this kind of canary thesis where you have Polkadot, the main chain, and then Kusama, which is a public testnet, that's actually a mainnet. So Picaso is the one on Kusama, and composable is the one that's going to still launch. It hasn't launched yet, their layer token layr, and there will also be an airdrop.
00:26:43.950 - 00:27:05.080, Speaker B: I'm 99% sure. We just haven't heard any public statements yet. But, yeah, that might also be, I don't know, for Pica stakers or for their bridge users bridging from their Kusama parachain to their cosmos chain. I don't know, speculation here, but might be also one to, to look into.
00:27:05.940 - 00:27:19.556, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay. Like, that's only good to know. And I think eclipse is a. I mean, we can talk about eclipse later when we talk about, I guess, Celestia, but I think that's also combining Solana virtual machine with EVM. Oh, okay. Oh, perfect.
00:27:19.668 - 00:27:56.620, Speaker B: Celestia. Celestia. I think that's gonna be a big one. So I listed modularity as kind of this theme, but it's actually really Celestia, which is the narrative, because Celestia kind of pioneered this concept of modularity and data availability. So, yeah, and they obviously, Tia got airdropped to atom and Osmo stakers and to a bunch of others also, like Ethereum community and researchers. I think that a very nice airdrop launching at a $2 billion valuation obviously helps for the airdrop to be big. So that was nice.
00:27:56.620 - 00:28:18.560, Speaker B: And now I think you're going to see a whole kind of airdrop season on Tia itself. So I think I listed a few here, but I think we can actually go and look into the ecosystem page. Damas just announced it, eclipse and movement labs. I think those are the biggest ones, but, yeah, we can look into their site.
00:28:18.980 - 00:28:59.268, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do that. And to my knowledge, this is how I kind of understood, this is how I explained Celestia. But Celestia makes it easier and cheaper to launch new roll ups and chains. So if all these projects use Celestia for data availability, then it's assumed that some of these projects are going to airdrop some of their supply to TSD, because that's the kind of the cosmos ethos. Let's get the token out there, let's give it the community build out liquidity, etcetera. Is that kind of like a good way to understand Celestia? Is like a better explanation that you can share?
00:28:59.324 - 00:29:14.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think at a core, what Celestia does, it separates the execution environment from the settlement environment. So you can combine different virtual machines with different consensus algorithms with different flavors, so to say.
00:29:14.740 - 00:29:14.916, Speaker A: Right.
00:29:14.948 - 00:30:06.380, Speaker B: So you have this full customization that you can do, and then what Celestia provides is data availability as a service which just breaks down the cost to verify a state to a fragmentation of what it's currently normally at. If you would verify the state through full nodes, you can do it through this concept of light nodes that they innovated, which you can run from your phone. So this is really celestial, and I think you're going to see wild combinations. Right. One of them is, in fact, eclipse. You already mentioned it. This is actually an Ethereum L, two that implements the Solana virtual machine and uses Celestia for data availability while being fully IBC compatible in cosmos.
00:30:06.380 - 00:30:43.584, Speaker B: This really showcases this whole concept of modularity. They most likely will do an airdrop. I talked to Neil recently, and I tried to get out as much alpha as I could as I always try to, but I think they're still figuring out their kind of general go to market and everything. But I think if you hear something like that, like Solana virtual machine, it might make sense to also maybe stake some soul. Right. While being in Ethereum. L two, I don't know, maybe they also drop it to EtH people and it's using Celestia.
00:30:43.584 - 00:31:07.020, Speaker B: So I would assume also tier stickers would probably be eligible if there is an airdrop. So yeah, this is really the concept of Celestia and I think eclipse is going to be one that's going to be really big. Dimension is one that actually just announced that they will do an airdrop or I think in crypto language they announced it. They just tweeted.
00:31:09.050 - 00:31:12.074, Speaker A: The snapshot. The camera, exactly.
00:31:12.162 - 00:31:37.890, Speaker B: Camera with a flash, but we all know what that means. So, yeah. Might mean though that the snapshot already happened. So if you don't have any ti staked right now, I don't know if you might be eligible for that. But yeah, that one is definitely going to go down for tier stakers. I also think for Atom stakers and even for Osmo. That's at least the rumors I've heard.
00:31:37.890 - 00:31:59.130, Speaker B: But yeah. And then I guess it might even go deeper than that. Right. So you stake atom, you get tia, you stake tia, you get the dym token dimension, maybe you can stake dym and you get any of their, I think here it's listed any of their.
00:32:00.510 - 00:32:10.660, Speaker A: No, if you click enter portal, you can kind of see the testnet. I think of like all the roll offs, they're mostly just like, like not real. I go back to that dimension website.
00:32:11.080 - 00:32:11.680, Speaker B: Okay.
00:32:11.760 - 00:32:13.072, Speaker A: And then enter portal.
00:32:13.256 - 00:32:13.840, Speaker B: Okay.
00:32:13.920 - 00:32:14.448, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:14.584 - 00:32:22.296, Speaker B: So if you stick dym, maybe you get access to one of their, I think it's like six or 700. Yeah, yeah.
00:32:22.328 - 00:32:45.858, Speaker A: And the TLDR for Dimension is it makes launching application like role apps like application chain like app chains easier. So like, I guess dimension uses Celestia for DA and then devs that want to create their own app chains can use dimension. Is that kind of, so like in theory, yes.
00:32:45.994 - 00:33:20.780, Speaker B: I haven't like done a deep dive on dimension, but basically what Celestia is kind of saying is that Celestia enables you to launch a chain as simple as launching a smart contract. And then I guess dimension is launch your application as easy as possible, which is this role app, which is an application on their role app framework. But I haven't done a deep dive on dimension. I just know that they were actually one of the earliest ones to use Celestia to partner with them.
00:33:22.200 - 00:33:59.760, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we can talk about all these chains, but there's so much. So maybe we can move on. But I like the Celestia staking idea, just because I feel like we're going to just enter this multi chain future. And it's really hard for me as a mid curve to bet on which chains to win. So the idea of staking Tia to passively get airdrops in the coming months, years, whatever, seems pretty attractive to me. And I think that's something that our audience should also consider. Is that kind of like a good way to view it?
00:34:00.780 - 00:34:53.316, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, I mean, I think Tia is a service, like Celestia is a service provider. And I think you're going to see a lot of native or applications and tokens or chains that use celestia. And obviously, airdrops in the end of the day are just mechanisms to bootstrap a community and an initial token holder base, not necessarily there to make us rich, even though sometimes we love the big juicy ones. But I think if you look around and Celestia itself is very hot, and evaluations at which some of these projects are currently raising already indicates, okay, even if it's a small percentage genesis airdrop, it might actually be decent. Decent in dollar terms. I always have this mentality.
00:34:53.316 - 00:35:37.422, Speaker B: I don't expect anything, to be honest. I don't expect a four figure airdrop, but if I get it, of course I'm happy. Bara chain, in fact, is also one that I think everybody should put on their watch list. Barachain is the next generation of EVM chains in Cosmos, and they will be used as a settlement layer here. I don't know exactly how the integration looks with Celestia, but I saw they were here and I'm quite bullish on barachain in general. They innovated Polaris and they also have a tree token model, so they have three tokens. They also have a stable token, but it's definitely super interesting and could also do an airdrop for tier stakers.
00:35:37.422 - 00:35:51.380, Speaker B: Same for saga. I think saga is also not live yet. They launch in Q one next year. I would love to see saga and Bera dropped to tier seekers too, but we don't have full confirmation yet.
00:35:51.960 - 00:35:59.660, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, like, that's definitely good to know. Can we go back to your doc? I think.
00:36:00.160 - 00:36:02.216, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I just wanted to mention.
00:36:02.328 - 00:36:03.280, Speaker A: Oh yeah, of course.
00:36:03.360 - 00:36:30.376, Speaker B: Here I thought there was one more that I. What to talk about now. Oh yeah, that's the one hyperlane category. But yeah, Hyperlane also actually announced that they will do an airdrop or tease it. I think you also talked with one of their team members recently.
00:36:30.448 - 00:36:31.712, Speaker A: Yeah. John. Yeah.
00:36:31.896 - 00:36:38.360, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's also one that might be interesting. And also manta. Manta network. I think that one could also be interesting.
00:36:38.400 - 00:36:53.730, Speaker A: Yeah. I made a video on Manta this week, and by the way, for our audience, we're recording this on the 22nd, just so that maybe some information might be a little bit outdated. But 25th is Christmas, so we're trying to get ahead of the curve here.
00:36:54.550 - 00:37:03.038, Speaker B: But I think modularity, Celestia is going to be big. Celestia, you're also going to see this modular, monolithic.
00:37:03.134 - 00:37:03.810, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:04.110 - 00:37:39.638, Speaker B: And movement labs, which wasn't listed yet at the, on the celestial ecosystem page for some reason. And maybe they just don't update it in real time. But movement is basically also an ethereum l two that deploys to move virtual machines. So if you like aptos and soy, you probably like them as well. And they use Celestia for data availability and they also use the avalanche snowman consensus. So full modularity. And I think they actually already confirmed to make an airdrop for Ti stakers.
00:37:39.638 - 00:37:44.930, Speaker B: So that's also definitely one to bookmark and to start following.
00:37:46.270 - 00:37:47.326, Speaker A: Got it?
00:37:47.518 - 00:38:13.740, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Then we have another category in Cosmos, which is the xterra category. And I think, to be honest, terra collapse obviously was crazy, and it affected cosmos. Liquidity, dried out on osmosis and everywhere literally collapsed. But now we're seeing a kind of fragmentation and revival of a lot of these Xterra projects. So Kujira is doing really well.
00:38:13.740 - 00:38:38.130, Speaker B: I mentioned that one already. Levana actually just had an airdrop, and I think they're going to do another airdrop. So maybe also one to watch out for. They just launched their LvN token. I think it's at a 200 million valuation right now, fully diluted. Maybe also want to watch out for future airdrops. Mars obviously already live astropor, you mentioned Apollo.
00:38:38.130 - 00:39:00.500, Speaker B: And then Prism is also one that is yet to launch. I think they're currently in their final stages before going on Mainnet. So, yeah, Prism might also do an airdrop, whether it's for early users or for stakers in the cosmos ecosystem. This, I don't know. But, yeah, they will definitely also do some form of airdrop.
00:39:00.800 - 00:39:56.100, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. Okay. And I guess talking about farming and airdrop, like all these yields and stuff, I think the idea of farming is to just plant the seeds now and then reap the harvests later. If you think about the farming lingo and whatnot, so I think everyone should consider, oh, like, hey, the cosmos ecosystem is cooking. If you just listen to somebody's podcasts that I guess teams have, like dimension neutron, you notice that these devs have been working for years and they're just about to launch, and it seems like 2024 might be a good year. So if someone is just getting started and I don't know how many minutes we're in, but, uh, they're interested in, I guess, staking atom, staking Tia and whatnot. Staking osmo, kuji, injective.
00:39:56.100 - 00:40:07.060, Speaker A: What do you think are best practices that one should consider in order to maximize their potential for getting a drops? Yeah, just general tips that you might have.
00:40:07.680 - 00:40:41.790, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think, you know, I think we went through a lot and I think people might be overwhelmed. So maybe we can also summarize a little bit. So which token should you consider to stake or hold, at least in Cosmos? I think number one is still atom, and I think that's still going to be the case moving forward in 2024. I think the second one is actually Tia, even though it just launched. But we talked through so many roll ups that are launching on Celestia. So I think staking Atom and Tia makes you eligible for a lot of airdrops.
00:40:41.790 - 00:41:33.800, Speaker B: How much should you stake? How do you stake? I think when it comes to how do you stake? There's great wallets like Kepler wallet, there's leap wallet, leap wallet, in fact, also now has an airdrop checker integrated into their wallet, which they just launched. And I think my call to action here is also to be super, super careful with airdrop claiming because there's a lot of phishing scams out there. So really be careful and go to kind of trusted sites, even though nothing is trusted on the Internet. But, you know, Lib is a solid wallet. They do their due diligence and whatever gets listed there I think should be legit. So, yeah, Atom and Tia through Kepler or Leap, non centralized exchange validators. So when you search for a validator, make sure it's a lower ranked validator.
00:41:33.800 - 00:42:10.686, Speaker B: No 0% commissions and also no hundred percent commissions. Because what most projects do when they give out an airdrop is they just exclude any centralized validators. And if you look for one, you might think like, oh yeah, I know Coinbase, I know binance, I trust them. You most likely disqualify yourself from airdrops just as a general rule. And I think additionally also be active in governance. Most cosmos chains have the governance module integrated. Celestia is actually one of the only ones that does not have it.
00:42:10.686 - 00:42:54.960, Speaker B: So in celestial, you don't have to do anything right now, but for atom voting governance proposals, be active there. And I think another question is how much should you stake, right? Because I think some of you might also want to farm it. So how much should you have at least on your wallet, right? Hard to say. I think at least eleven atom or tia respectively. I would say, to be on the safe side, more than $500 worth of those tokens. So I think in both cases that's around 50 50 tokens, but eleven should be the minimum. I've seen airdrops where the requirement was literally eleven.
00:42:54.960 - 00:43:39.174, Speaker B: I think that's the, the general strategy. And then I think we talked about injective, about osmosis, about Kujira. This is kind of like also a no brainer in my opinion, to stake those as well with the same kind of methodology. Because I think there's going to be a lot of airdrops as well. And a bonus strategy for airdrops is going to be holding a bad kid NFT on Stargaze. We literally saw just now the first airdrop given to Namada, the num token that is giving out an airdrop to badkit NFT holders. And there's only 3000 of them.
00:43:39.174 - 00:43:58.870, Speaker B: So you get a lot of tokens. If you stake that. I think it's going to be more than that. And also there's probably going to be a bad git NFT tokenization to be airdrop to NFT holders. So yeah, that's kind of maybe like a bonus.
00:43:59.210 - 00:44:06.670, Speaker A: Do you think? They're like the crypto punks of Adam and you can get this on. Was it Stargaze? Was it Stargaze? The NFT market.
00:44:08.930 - 00:44:15.954, Speaker B: 100%. Yeah. And I think now, like bad kids, the floor went up like ten x, I think in the last few weeks.
00:44:16.122 - 00:44:16.990, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:44:17.460 - 00:44:41.604, Speaker B: Customers pumped and then people kind of tape into they want to join the culture, right? And I think nfts are culture. Meme coins are culture. So you see now a lot of meme coins, and you also see a lot of, you know, hype around bad kids, and bad kids really are the punks in cosmos, you know? Okay, that's a bonus, but it's quite, I think it's three k right now, 3000 USD.
00:44:41.692 - 00:45:04.278, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, if you view it as the punks, it could be worth more, I suppose. But who knows? Nobody really knows. I think you wanted to talk about the Namada airdrop. It's time sensitive, right? I think there's like the claim expires on the 27th, but I think, I mean, the snapshot's already done, so you can't really do anything if you don't have it.
00:45:04.294 - 00:45:59.590, Speaker B: But yeah, I just think what I mentioned earlier is the most important when you claim. I literally got a call from a friend, unfortunately, a few days ago, who got hacked, like wiped out his wallet because he got into a phishing scam for airdrop claims. My call to action really is be extremely careful. The Namada Airdrop, a lot of people are aping into it right now because it is actually modeled on the Ti Airdrop. So they're pursuing the same kind of methodology and process, which means also that there's only a limited window during which you have to claim the airdrop. The chain is only going to launch in Q one, so it's still going to be a few months until you actually receive the airdrop, but you have five days now to claim you. Check your eligibility.
00:45:59.590 - 00:46:34.648, Speaker B: Atom Osmo and badkit NFT holders are eligible. And also I mentioned earlier the leap wallet airdrop checker. That's the one here, please start using that as well. Bookmark this and always cross check the URL's, the links, because just so much scam out there. And the third source might be airdrops one, which is a site that usually also keeps track of that. There's so many airdrops that you can claim soon. There's a lot of airdrops that you can actually claim right now.
00:46:34.648 - 00:46:48.060, Speaker B: There's even sometimes airdrops like I have never heard about. I'm like, oh, nice, I get some free tokens, right? So yeah, I think that's the best places to stay up to date.
00:46:48.720 - 00:47:10.910, Speaker A: Yeah. And I just saw this this morning, but I think there's some random meme coin that took a snapshot yesterday. So chances are use a stake and you forget about it. And then you come back and who knows? There's like $4 worth of random shit coins or whatever. I have no idea. But yeah, okay, thank you, crypto cedar. This was really helpful.
00:47:10.910 - 00:47:49.370, Speaker A: And yeah, there's so many damn chains. I've been spending a lot of time recently. It's like trying to understand everything, but even then I'm like, okay, this is a little bit overwhelming. But hopefully with interoperability there can be, I guess, some version of, I guess, account abstraction where you don't have to know which chain you're on. User experience has to improve in order for the next wave of users to come in. Do you have any 2024 predictions around the cosmos ecosystem that you want to share. I know they're going to be bullish, but just, I guess predictions, I suppose.
00:47:50.830 - 00:48:22.160, Speaker B: I think it's very hard to say. I think one prediction is that we will see IBC compatibility with ethereum, which would unlock a lot of value. And we talked a lot about liquidity in the beginning of the conversation. I think that could be a big driver. I also think that, yeah, just generally, I'm super bullish on many things in cosmos. I also think there's still challenges to overcome. But yeah, I think if I were to pick the next, like my prediction, what's the next celestia, maybe that's an interesting prediction to make.
00:48:22.160 - 00:48:26.364, Speaker B: I have four contenders and I'm unsure which one of them is going to.
00:48:26.372 - 00:48:27.492, Speaker A: Be the biggest one.
00:48:27.676 - 00:49:03.660, Speaker B: My first one is barachain. We talked about it. That's the first one. The second one is saga. We also mentioned that earlier, saga is actually going to be a gaming hub in Cosmos, and gaming is something severely underexplored. And I think saga itself is also going to be airdropped for staking atom, I would assume, and also for avalanche and polygon because they have partnerships. And then staking Saga might make you eligible for their 300 plus games that are deployed on Saga.
00:49:03.660 - 00:49:39.158, Speaker B: So saga, I want to bookmark. My third contender is Babylon chain. I think Babylon is going to be a big one as well because they will leverage bitcoin security for Cosmos chains and enable bitcoin staking. And my fourth one is Namada, actually, which is the airdrop you guys should claim right now. And that's a privacy protocol, so that's to implement ZK proofs. And I think privacy is also going to be a big theme next year in Cosmos. So those are my four contenders.
00:49:39.158 - 00:49:46.970, Speaker B: I think all of them have, like, multi billion dollar energy and potential. So we'll see.
00:49:47.830 - 00:50:11.810, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. I know Bearachain raised like $42 million and people forgot about them because they're supposed to launch this year. But I have no idea what's going on. But I've seen Smokey Dibera talk on, I guess, conferences and whatnot. It's coming. It's coming eventually. I know there's bear chain nfts which might get some airdrops as well.
00:50:11.810 - 00:50:16.210, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. Yeah.
00:50:17.390 - 00:50:51.200, Speaker B: Barrichain, like I said, they raised $42 million at a $420.69 million valuation. So raising that at this valuation in a bear market is crazy. Saga, I think they raised it to $200 million valuation the last round. And they actually just onboarded placeholder VC with Chris Berniski, who is one of the most respected investors, I guess in crypto Babylon just announced an $18 million raise. The second one already. They raised a couple million before that as well, at a.
00:50:51.200 - 00:51:22.726, Speaker B: I think it was $150 million the last round. And I think Namada raised over 550 million us dollars. I think it was also $500 million valuation for anoma, which is the project, and Namada is the chain. So those are all big raises during the 2023 kind of harsh bear market year. This is really impressive. So I wouldn't be surprised if they launch with billion dollar valuations fully diluted.
00:51:22.838 - 00:51:44.672, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think Manta network, they raised 50 million at a half a billion dollar valuation. And I think they're launching a token in January or something. I have no idea. Sometime in Q one. So, yeah, I mean, I think the point of the video is Cosmos teams, cosmos chains, they're being funded, they're building, they're launching. If they have all these vc's, chances are they're gonna have tokens.
00:51:44.672 - 00:52:12.440, Speaker A: If they have tokens, maybe some are airdropped. So don't fade the cosmos ecosystem. And if you do fade, at least be aware of what's cooking there. Just look into it, I guess. Well, thank you, crypto Cedar. I think this is a very educational interview video. Do you have any final words? I guess anything you want to leave our audience with? Yeah, anything for Christmas.
00:52:13.020 - 00:52:49.056, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, happy holidays, everyone. I think also try to not overdo it and not chase every airdrop, not chase every pump. Crypto can be very exhausting. I think we all also are still exhausted from this year. So, yeah, don't overdo it. If you chase airdrops or meme coins or anything, always remember the pain and the frustration we had in a bear market because it was very harsh and it's easy to fall back into the old patterns. And it's crazy to me how fast this went.
00:52:49.056 - 00:53:28.278, Speaker B: Literally within six weeks, people threw out their entire PTSD out of the window chasing new dog coins every single day. So, yeah, I think part of it also crypto, that's what it is. It's a crazy, wild, wild west industry. But just be aware that you should have a solid strategy and not chase everything that's flashing out there. But, yeah, I really appreciate that. And people can find me on YouTube. I do a lot of videos now that Cosmos is kind of exploding, obviously, and mostly active on Twitter as well, so that's where people can find me.
00:53:28.454 - 00:53:44.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I was on your channel too. I think we had an interview with Altcoin Psycho. I think one of my predictions was Evmos was going to be a top 50 chain or something. And unfortunately that didn't happen. Maybe bear chain will be the evmos.
00:53:45.200 - 00:54:10.080, Speaker B: But also I think there's a couple of Cosmos chains. That's really what you said in the beginning. Cosmos is an ecosystem of builders. And in the bear market all these projects have they kept on building. FMOs is one of the teams that got hit extremely hard and there was some internal drama with the founders and one exited and sold his coins. They didn't really caught up to their promises. But I think we're going to see some revivals.
00:54:10.080 - 00:54:36.790, Speaker B: I don't know if FMO is going to be a top 50 coin. I don't think anytime soon at least. But yeah, I think some of these coins are worth to look into and see. Okay. What's the likelihood of this coin to potentially do a comeback? Right, because stargaze in a similar way. Like they got crashed in the bear market with price movement, price action. But I think its one of the most bullish teams in cosmos or in crypto maybe even.
00:54:36.790 - 00:54:41.570, Speaker B: Right. So yeah, I think, like I said, dont fade the cosmos.
00:54:41.950 - 00:55:13.758, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think during the bear all these chains have high inflation so it just gets dumped to oblivion. But maybe that just leads to lower USD prices. And if you think about investing and succeeding as investors, its looking at things when no one's paying attention. Because once everyone's paying attention. How early are you? If you view it in that lens? Yeah, I'm going to spend a lot of time into the cosmos ecosystem. Yeah. Well anyways, thank you Mister Crypto Cedo.
00:55:13.758 - 00:55:25.758, Speaker A: Make sure to subscribe to his YouTube channel. It's the Cosmos YouTube channel. I watch almost all his videos so look out for those and thank you ashwashi and I'll talk to you or I'll see you another time. Bye.
