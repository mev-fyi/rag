00:00:00.720 - 00:00:22.745, Speaker A: What is up guys? Tygi here and today I'd like to give an update on Defi Kingdoms Jewel and the Luna ecosystem and the Astroport lock drop. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment. The comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so obviously Defi Kingdoms saving the rest of my portfolio, you know, pushing all time highs, hit $12. I think it almost hit $13 yesterday. But you know, this remains my highest commission farm.
00:00:22.745 - 00:01:02.589, Speaker A: I've been into it like it's, it's one of the most comfiest farms I can be part of, right? I mean all I've been doing is I'm just like going to the gardens, you know, just letting a sit and just. Joel keeps going up, right? It's crazy. It's an amazing feeling to farm something that people actually want to buy and kind of need to buy in order to play the game. And I'll kind of touch on the gaming aspect later too. But you know this, this chart is up only for now, right? For now. Is this a good buy right now? I have no idea. But you know me, I'm just farming it, right? I don't really stress out too much, right? I've heard all the fud about like, oh my God, aren't you worried XYZ is going to cause the price of Jewel to dump? And like, maybe it will, right? But I really don't care because I have a, you know, mid to longer term time horizon on this one.
00:01:02.589 - 00:01:52.771, Speaker A: And you know, my simple strategy is to just keep farming it, right? Just keep farming it. And I don't really care about the price volatility. I mean like for me, I just kind of check up on my farms like once every few days and I just thought like, oh yeah, Juul is going up. You know, it's, it's, it's kind of a crazy feeling. But you know, I often argue that I think Juul and the Defi Kingdoms form is just, just a good farm, right? Objectively a good farm. Because you know, like, I'll talk about Luna later but like, are you bullish Luna? Because I'm bullish Luna, right? I've been bullish Luna for a long time now. And if you want exposure to Luna, right? But you're kind of worried about, you know, like maybe some price volatility, right? Just because it's gone up a lot, right? I mean, look, okay, like first of all, look at Luna, right? You go to the weekly, you look at log and like what is this, right? This is ridiculous, right? I mean, like, what is going on? Like on January 4th, the weekly open for this was $0.66,
00:01:52.771 - 00:02:12.111, Speaker A: right. And it's at $80. So obviously we've had a crazy alt season. I don't know how long this alt season is going to last. But you know, in the meantime, you know, if you want exposure to Luna, maybe, maybe this farm is a good one, right? Just earn 540% on an asset. Luna, which is just going up, right. And Jewel, which is also going up, you know, nice and comfy.
00:02:12.111 - 00:02:43.423, Speaker A: How about Joule and Eth? Are you bullish Eth? Because I'm bullish eth. Why not put some, you know, paired up some Juul with some eth if you're worried about downside protection and whatnot or downside volatility and obviously not as financial advice, Right. I'm just some Asian guy on the Internet. But you know, I mean, Juul like highest commissioner farm, it actually flipped eth in my portfolio. So, you know, I think roughly 86% of my portfolio is bitcoin Defi kingdoms, Eth and Luna. Right. So, you know, the markets have been kind of weak, right? And bitcoin indeed hasn't done too well.
00:02:43.423 - 00:02:58.467, Speaker A: But like generally like I'm the most. My exposure is like in these assets that are doing well. So there's that. And I don't really have exposure to Avax. And I'm probably going to enter this form in the new year, right. Just because I'm in the Jewel 1 and Jewel USDC pool, right. Which is like just awful decisions.
00:02:58.467 - 00:03:17.627, Speaker A: But I entered it like months ago, so I couldn't foresee Jewel going up this much. But I don't have too much exposure to Avax, right. I've been farming Avax since August and whatnot. But it's not like a huge portfolio, right. I mean, farming is a slow way to build up your vax, but it's not like the fast way to know. It's like build up an Avax position. So in the new year, I think I'm going to enter this one, right.
00:03:17.627 - 00:03:31.083, Speaker A: Just so I can have Avax exposure. And you know, if I can farm Juul holding Juul and Avax at 5%, why not do so? Right. And you know, these are their good forms too. Maybe it's like a lower. You have a lower risk tolerance or. Yeah. And then you can just enter a bitcoin need.
00:03:31.083 - 00:03:50.381, Speaker A: You know, I think this is good forms, right? Just objectively good forms. So, you know, I mean, I continue to be bliss Drool right? My thesis has not changed. I mean, you know, the team continues to ship. More users begin onboarding. Like, the heroes are like selling for insane amounts. And, you know, I think it's one of those things, you know, I've been saying it for some time. Like, I think.
00:03:50.381 - 00:04:31.525, Speaker A: I think it's like one of the most obvious plays in crypto that, you know, most people will faint just because they'll convince themselves that they're like, too late or something. And I said this when Joel was like, $8, right? And like, at $12, like, what is it? Goodbye. I have no idea, right? I don't do price predictions. I don't trade, right. All I do is farm. But, you know, if you think about the potential narratives, because crypto is driven on narratives, Defi Kingdoms kind of has it all, right? It's Defi, it's cross chain, right? They're going to go to a bunch of EVM chains first, starting with Avax, maybe expanding to Matic, BSC and Phantom, right? I think those kind of make sense. So it's cross chain Defi game that's play to earn with utility NFTs, that's actually selling for like crazy amounts.
00:04:31.525 - 00:04:57.109, Speaker A: And I'll kind of go over Heroes later because, like, in the first couple of months, right, in the. In the three months I've been, I've been in this farm, like, I haven't really played a game, right? I missed out on the Gen Zero Hero mint. I gave away my Gen Zero Hero, that's like, worth like 70k now. But, you know, I'm looking into the market, right, and trying to buy some heroes myself. And, you know, I was also on CNBC talking about Jewel. So, you know, check out that clip on YouTube if anyone's interested. I'm joking.
00:04:57.109 - 00:05:49.385, Speaker A: But anyways, what you should check out actually is Jewel cast, right? I was on this episode on the 16th. And one of the reasons I really like Defi Kingdoms is purely on the fact that, you know, there are like a bunch of YouTubers that only specifically, specifically cover Defi Kingdoms. And, you know, there's a community of, you know, jewel lovers, I guess, that actually created a community podcast called Jewelcast. You know, just the fact that these communities are popping up without, you know, like the Jewel or the Defi Kingdoms team, like, having to compensate for these folks, you know, just shows you how strong of a community it is. And, you know, if you need any more evidence that there's a bunch of people, a bunch of eyeballs and money in this game, you know, just understand that, you know, the floor for Gen Zero Heroes is roughly 60 to $70,000 at this point. Right. Which is pretty insane given that roughly two months ago, or maybe two and a half months ago, you could mint them for like $1,500.
00:05:49.385 - 00:06:02.665, Speaker A: Right? I still cope, like having missed, like, I still cope missing out on that. Right? Because I knew about it, I saw it, and I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to farm Joel. And I'm happy. Right. Obviously. But it definitely hurts. It definitely hurts knowing that I could have done it.
00:06:02.665 - 00:06:24.197, Speaker A: But speaking of heroes, I wasn't too interested in the fishing and the forging quests. I'm more interested in the mining and the gardening quests. And the gardening quests are going to come December 22nd, and the mining quests are going to come the 29th of December. So. TL. Dr. For those that don't know, and don't get me wrong, I'm not an expert in this either.
00:06:24.197 - 00:07:03.707, Speaker A: But essentially the gardening quest is that if you do gardening quests, you can essentially boost your aprs on your jewel forms, essentially. So, you know, your heroes, right? Your gardener heroes could have utility, right? Because maybe it costs like 3,000, $4,000 to buy a hero, but maybe it creates more value because it's going to increase your APR by X percent. We don't know these numbers yet. By X percent. And if you give given like the unlock schedule, maybe it's worth your capital, right? So gardeners I'm pretty excited for. I might buy one in the miners. I think miners have gotten like a huge premium in the open market just because what miners allow you to do in the mining quest is that it's going to allow you to unlock your locked jewels much faster.
00:07:03.707 - 00:07:40.241, Speaker A: So, you know, if you've been farming this for a while, like, the amount of locked jewel that like we all have is insane, right? It's like crazy amounts of money. But, you know, it's locked until July of 2022, and then it's going to be linearly vested, I believe, for 12 months, roughly. July, right. Depending on the harmony block times. So right now I think the majority of the premium is being placed on the miners just because I think people just want to unlock their lock jewel. But recently there's been a huge price surge in gardener heroes, and they'll kind of go over, you know, if you go to the tavern, you can kind of see this. I kind of filtered for sage gardeners, which I think is one of the best.
00:07:40.241 - 00:08:02.219, Speaker A: And right now the floor is 324. Right. Which you know, in my mind I'm like, okay, that's only 300 jewel. But I kind of for. I always forget that one jewel is $12. It's kind of crazy, but you know, it's kind of crazy that you know, these heroes are being listed for like these amount, like you know, these prices, right? I mean this, I think this is like a mythical, legendary. It's like 15,000 jewel.
00:08:02.219 - 00:08:26.701, Speaker A: Like what? That's like 200k. My God. Like the USD. That's crazy. But you know, it's kind of funny too because I mean the game itself is like one of those things where like I know I can make more money if I like learned it, but I just like haven't had the time. Right. And you know, I don't fully understand all of this, right? But if you like just go to the tavern and kind of scroll through all these heroes, I'm like, damn, like a restaurant.
00:08:26.701 - 00:08:53.525, Speaker A: Free Bone kind of looks cool. You know, it's just like, oh, it's only 500 jewel. That's $6,000. It's kind of, it's kind of wild. And right now it's kind of based on speculation just because, I mean the gardening quests are gonna come the 22nd and the mining quest the 29th. But you know, I also said like, oh, these heroes are way too expensive when they're like $3,000, right? So like what the hell do I know? But you know, jewelry comfiest farms in all of crypto. Let me just refresh the price.
00:08:53.525 - 00:09:14.445, Speaker A: I think it's like roughly $12. Yep, $12. And I still think that it's a great way for you to gain exposure to these L1s, right? If you're bullish Avax, just farm this. If you're bullish Eth, maybe you can farm this Luna, you know, Etc. Right. And there's a Crystal Veil expansion coming in, Q1 to Avalanche. And yes, there's going to be some dilution, right, because they're going to be introducing new heroes and new tokens.
00:09:14.445 - 00:09:50.983, Speaker A: But I think the incremental demand that's going to come out of the Avalanche expansion is going to be, you know, it's gonna outweigh the supply, the supply increase. Because right now like Defi Kingdoms is in a Harmony, right? And like who uses Harmony? Like no one uses Harmony outside of Defi Kingdoms and there aren't that many users on Harmony, right? So if they do expand to, you know, a top tier chain like Avax, then you can imagine that, you know, There's a bunch of people that, you know, never, you know, thought about entering Defi kingdoms. They're gonna see and be like, oh, this is actually cool. Okay. It kind of makes sense why all these people were showing it to me like, you know, a few weeks or a few months ago. But you know, juul. Keep, keep farming it.
00:09:50.983 - 00:10:20.865, Speaker A: Keep farming it. Okay, so let's go back into Luna, right? And I think Luna and Avax are having the top performers when it comes to just all of crypto, right? And when it comes to like top 30 assets and whatnot. And I continue to be, you know, like bullish Luna, I think it's got a lot of catalysts coming up. We've had the Astroport lock drop coming on, which I'll talk about. And then we have Mars the lock drop happening in Q1, right. Hopefully in January. And I think those two are going to be huge catalysts just because right now in the Terra ecosystem there really isn't like a primary Dex, a premier Dex.
00:10:20.865 - 00:11:06.645, Speaker A: Terrasoft is okay, but like no one, like, no one likes terraswap, right? No one's bullish terraswap. So Astro, astroport, which is going to be Uniswap, curve and balancer all in one product, I think it's going to command a lot of attention in that lot of tvl. And speaking of which, I mean this, over a billion dollars of liquidity was added to the lock drop before it's even launched, right? That's kind of crazy to think about. I think, you know, at current TVO levels, I think Astroport is already like a top 15 dex in all of crypto and it hasn't even launched yet. So it kind of goes to show you how much appetite there is for the Terra ecosystem. I mean, we've been waiting this for a long time, right? We knew this was coming for four months and now it's finally here and you know, people are just going, going bananas over it and you know, Terra roughly. Let me refresh this.
00:11:06.645 - 00:11:34.023, Speaker A: No, it's at number nine, right. And if you don't count stablecoin, it's number seven. And I have often mentioned that I think Luna is, could be a top five coin, right? And not mentioned and not counting like Tether and usdc, right. Because I don't consider them investable assets. So for Terra to get to top five, all it has to do is flip XRP. Right? At $40 billion, a market cap, which I don't understand that. But anyways, luna roughly at $30 billion, all it has to do is outperform Cardano and XRP by 33%.
00:11:34.023 - 00:12:09.377, Speaker A: Right? And it's going to flip them, right? Like it's happening, right? I think it's gonna happen. Maybe I'm too bullish, right? I often tell my viewers, like, you know, I'm like overly bullish when it comes to Luna and Defi Kingdoms. So maybe, you know, take, take what I say with a grain of salt. But you know, I'm human, right? I have emotions and you know, I just, I just love Luna and Joule. As you can obviously see, I'm making a video on this. But, you know, I think Luna and Evax can, you know, flip XRP and Cardano over time. I don't want to bash Cardano too much just because, you know, I just like, I'm not a fan of assets that you just like can't use, right.
00:12:09.377 - 00:12:49.351, Speaker A: I just, I just like don't understand how it has such a high valuation. But maybe when it does launch smart contracts like whenever, right? Maybe it's 2022, 2023 and like actual apps are live and like, you know, there's a thriving ecosystem. Maybe I'll change my mind. And I've, you know, I mentioned that like when Cardano has farms, I'm going to enter farms just because I think, you know, people are going to be way too fork and it's going to be a great environment for, you know, farmers that's going to take profits, if you know what I mean. So there's that kind of crazy because Polkadot was also flipped by both Terra Navax, you know, Terra and Avax, great ecosystems. But anyways, let's, let's move on. I don't want this to be another 20 to 30 minute video, which it's probably going to be one.
00:12:49.351 - 00:13:16.643, Speaker A: Yeah, it's probably. Anyways, anyways, it's going to go over to Long Drop. So it's going to have three phases. Phase zero, phase one and phase two. And phase zero essentially means like, you know, early Terra users are going to get airdrops, right, For Astroport. And if you were staking Luna or had Bluna on anchor on September 9th at this time you're going to get an airdrop. And also if you were being a liquidity provider on terraswap, you're also going to get an airdrop, right? As long as you redid it on September 9th.
00:13:16.643 - 00:13:44.825, Speaker A: So I did this, right? So I'm going to get this airdrop. And I was also farming on Mirror, right? Mirror Finance and terraswap is the same, same thing. So if you were farming on mirror, if you're long farming on mirror, you're going to be eligible for the airdrop. I don't know how much it's going to be. You know, I always insisted that I think it's going to be like roughly four figures but you know, I think it's going to be roughly around that. Hopefully it's a lot more. But you know, I don't do price predictions but I think Astroport, I think it can be like a half a billion dollar protocol.
00:13:44.825 - 00:14:00.425, Speaker A: Right. And I think that's been conservative. Astro is a uniswap curve and balancer all in one. They have no competition. It's going to lock up all tvl I mean come on, it locked up a billion dollars in TVL pre launch. That's kind of crazy. And this is how I locked up my LP positions.
00:14:00.425 - 00:14:32.141, Speaker A: So you know my B Luna Luna stake, right? This is essentially all my Luna holdings. It's essentially a position with no impermanent loss risk. So I'm kind of thinking of it as a way to stake my Luna to receive Astra allocations. And I staggered my locks in three buckets, two months, four months and six months. And I'm probably, I mean I'm probably not going to sell my Luna in January, on February, right. Whenever this thing unlocks. But I think the additional flexibility that I can have by just like staggering it is worth a lot more.
00:14:32.141 - 00:14:43.333, Speaker A: Right? Because originally I was going to do six months, right. For all my position. But a bunch of people smarter than me convinced me otherwise. And INC USD, right. I farmed INC over time, right. I'm single block it over 52 weeks. I don't really care.
00:14:43.333 - 00:15:05.659, Speaker A: Psi USD. I got psi as an airdrop. It's probably, probably gonna keep dumping but you know, I'll just lock up 52 weeks and farm as much as possible. So there's that and there's a great video by Danku R. Right. He, I had him on my channel a few times. He, he, he primarily covers the Luna ecosystem and he shared this interesting graphic which I thought was interesting, right.
00:15:05.659 - 00:15:43.277, Speaker A: Make sure to subscribe to him. Maybe I'll have him on my channel again relatively soon. But essentially the this is like the majority of this graph is showing like how, how much or how long people locked up their LP positions on the Astral Port lockdrop. And it seems like most of the people either did like two to four weeks or 50 to 52 weeks, which is kind of insane, right? There's like no One in the middle. I'm kind of in this bucket right in the middle because I just kind of hate locking up my assets for that long. But, you know, maybe they're gonna get a bunch of Astro and like, they're gonna make more money than me. Like, who knows? Just, just an interesting graphic that I found useful or I thought it was interesting.
00:15:43.277 - 00:16:19.835, Speaker A: And you know, you also have to understand that like the V. Luna Luna pool, right, not only am I staking it essentially or locking it to receive Astro, right now I'm also earning 12.37% right on this position, which is pretty insane, right? And I'll provide a link in the description for this dashboard. When astroport launches, this is probably going to like get scrapped, right? Because, you know, this, this UI isn't that great and astroport's going to just like take up all the. It's going to gobble up all the tbl essentially. But it's a good way to look at like, okay, what is the APR from swap fees, right? Because there is no Terra swap token. And I think phase two is something I'm going to go over more just because I think it's a little confusing.
00:16:19.835 - 00:17:09.561, Speaker A: But, you know, because, you know, these, these long drops, these phases last seven days. You don't necessarily have to enter them immediately, right? You can kind of let the market decide and you can let the market settle and then figure out what you want to do. Like, I'm personally not going to rush into this stuff tomorrow and just like, you know, ape into like the first day, I'm probably going to enter this like maybe day four, day three or something. But this is essentially a way for there to be price discovery on the Astro token. So if you go back to the original Medium article, right, about AstroPort, the token allocations, you see that phase two is provided the initial liquidity for ASTRO tokens and they will also act like a price discovery period for Astra tokens, which I think is pretty interesting. So let's kind of go over what this actually means. So, so let's assume that when it launches, it's the pool has 100 UST and 100 ASTRO, right? Just 100 of each.
00:17:09.561 - 00:17:42.733, Speaker A: So the implied price for ASTRO is $1, right? Because there's one UST for everyone, ASTRO. If someone thinks, right, that if someone believes that Astro should be worth more than $1, a user can deposit 100 UST into this pool. And then after that the pool composition is going to be 200 USD and 100 astronomy. And then the implied Astro Price is going to be $2 and I have no idea what the price of Astro is going to do. I'm probably just going to take all my Astro that I'm going to get and just like dump it in there at some point. But I think it's pretty cool, right? I think it's pretty cool. It kind of prevents front running by whales.
00:17:42.733 - 00:18:17.505, Speaker A: It's a way for there to be like natural price discovery because once you like lock it up, I don't think you can like, you know, withdraw it for some time after the lock drop. I think it gets linearly vested for three months or something. But you know, on the other hand if the, you know, if the implied price of Astro is $1 and someone thinks that's way too expensive, then anyone can just place 100 astro. And then the implied price is, you know, 0.5 USD. Or if you think that's a fair value, then you can put 100 USD, 100 Astro. So the pool composition is, you know, you know, just one, the ratio is one, one and then you know, the implied Astro price is one USD.
00:18:17.505 - 00:18:43.053, Speaker A: I have no idea what the price is going to be. Right. I'm just going to store it in there. But you know, I think roughly half a billion dollars in market cap for this token kind of makes sense. I feel like it's a conservative estimate, but I think it's better to be conservative and then to just have like crazy moonshot targets. And you know, I'll also provide a description, a link in the description for this tool, right? It's, it's a pretty cool tool. So you know, for me I'm in this one, right.
00:18:43.053 - 00:19:17.821, Speaker A: So kind of I'm thinking about like how much Astro am I going to receive and it doesn't really capture, you know, what's, what's in the middle. Right. So I locked up mine for two, four, six months and it kind of only shows data for two weeks and 52 weeks. But maybe I'm in the roughly 30 to 50 Astro tokens per $1,000 of LP. And you know, this, this pool is like oversubscribed and this, this is half a billion dollars already. So maybe I'm not going to get too much. But you know, like I'm in my mind, I'm just taking my Luna that I'm not going to sell anyways and just staking it, locking it and just earning Astro tokens, you know, for, for free I guess.
00:19:17.821 - 00:19:34.565, Speaker A: So that's kind of how I think about it. Yeah. And yeah, there's this website too. It's kind of, there's a bunch of errors. I'll provide a link in the description but you know it's, it's kind of like an astro. Yeah it's not, it's not loading but it's a kind of like an astro calculator. So depending on the price of astro like how much rewards can you get Right.
00:19:34.565 - 00:19:57.405, Speaker A: So all these tools are there. I think you know the better the data is going to get better over time but you know Luna jewel bullish, you know, very bullish. The entire markets aren't looking that great but you know Luna n doing well. No spell also doing well. I'm farming that too. You know Juul obviously doing great. So thank you guys for watching.
00:19:57.405 - 00:20:04.245, Speaker A: Have a farming out there and yeah 20 minute video, you know standard, standard t stuff. Thank you guys. Thank you guys for watching and have fun out there.
