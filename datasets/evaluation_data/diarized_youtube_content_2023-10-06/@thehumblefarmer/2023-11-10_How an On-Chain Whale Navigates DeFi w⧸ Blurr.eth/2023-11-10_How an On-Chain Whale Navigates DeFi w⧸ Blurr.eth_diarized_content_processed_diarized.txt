00:00:01.080 - 00:00:08.730, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taki here. And welcome to episode five of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I have here with me blur. Eat. How are you doing today?
00:00:09.310 - 00:00:11.406, Speaker B: I'm doing really well, thank you, Tyche.
00:00:11.598 - 00:00:24.690, Speaker A: Nice, nice. So this is, to my knowledge, the first time you're ever doing a podcast. Is there any reason why you've kept such a low profile and why are you doing this? You don't have to do this. You only taking the time out of your business a day.
00:00:26.030 - 00:00:58.930, Speaker B: Yeah, that's entirely true. And it is the first time I've sort of done anything like this. I guess in one sense, it's kind of been like an optionality thing. Being very anonymous has served me quite well in the past, and in a way, one can sort of slightly build a brand around that, and that has been useful to have. But equally, you know, as with everything in life, some things get boring, and having interesting conversations with interesting people is always a great way to spend time. So, yeah, here I am.
00:00:59.550 - 00:01:11.570, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. So what are the advantages of being anon, if you don't mind me asking? Because I'm super doxxed, so there are disadvantages, but what, let's say, benefits have you gotten from being this mysterious figure?
00:01:11.950 - 00:02:00.672, Speaker B: So, weirdly, most of them aren't really crypto related. I do a lot of slightly out there travel, I'd say, and in a lot of situations, being like a known entity and trying to do that don't really mix very well. It just increases your risk profile quite a lot. And so it was largely that. And then equally, for a while, I wasn't entirely sure whether or not this was something I wanted to sort of attach my name to for life, if that makes sense. Because once you've sort of become a person that does this, that's who you are, you can kind of maybe break away from it, but I wasn't sure that I wanted to necessarily make that my brand going forward, so it just sort of made sense to remain hidden, in a way, equally. I've never really done any sort of social media of any sort.
00:02:00.672 - 00:02:14.642, Speaker B: I've never had a Facebook account, Instagram profile, whatever. So it just sort of naturally fit for me. I've never really been one that felt like I needed to sort of push my views out onto other people or. Or project in that way. So, yeah.
00:02:14.826 - 00:02:31.194, Speaker A: Yeah. You don't even have a Twitter account. Right. I feel like a lot of people say that you need to have. You need to be on crypto Twitter to get the alpha or get information flow or whatever. But do you think that's not necessary? Is there a reason you don't use crypto Twitter? Or are you.
00:02:31.362 - 00:03:12.482, Speaker B: I've been doing this for pretty much as long as it's been a thing, sort of defi specifically. And so having sort of come up with it, it's less true for me than I'd say for most, you know, equally. I have a lot of sort of discord groups, telegram, chats, whatever, where basically anything that's interesting will percolate down into it anyway. So it's not like I'm missing out on anything at all. There are situations where, I don't know, I've deposited size into something and would like to have some sort of connection with the developer behind it and struggle, because I'm just not a known entity. If they don't necessarily know who you are, that can be challenging. And if I did have some sort of public profile, it might be easier, but I.
00:03:12.482 - 00:03:15.170, Speaker B: It's a price worth paying. Or has been historically, I think.
00:03:15.630 - 00:03:21.558, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's this fake blur on Twitter that's like shilling some scam coin. People think that.
00:03:21.654 - 00:03:35.142, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, there's been a few of them over the years. It's. Yeah. You know, what can you do about it? I sort of feel like a lot of the time, the barber Streisand effect takes over, where if you actually try and do something about it, you're probably just gonna make the situation worse. So I just leave it. Sleeping lines lie.
00:03:35.326 - 00:03:43.720, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair. So you mentioned you've been doing this for a pretty long time. Do you mind telling me how you got into crypto when you started getting into crypto trading, defi, et cetera?
00:03:43.910 - 00:04:19.170, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, it was a Tuesday night. I was in my dorm room at uni, and I read an article on the BBC. I think it was about how some little game had broken the Ethereum blockchain, and that game was, of course, cryptokitties back in the tail end of 2017. And I just sort of thought it looked interesting. So went and found the website and sort of basically fell down the rabbit hole and haven't really been able to climb out since then, but put in very small size, mid to high three figures, I think. And that, to date, has been the only sort of capital I've onboarded.
00:04:19.170 - 00:05:19.970, Speaker B: Yeah. And sort of dropped out of uni not long after that and got really into it. And at that point in time, it was very much the sort of the weird little games, the Dapps, as they were then known, although that name has fallen out of favorite turning into the sort of ponzi schemes of 2019, the proof of weak hands, if you know what that was, or have heard of that FOMO 3D, all those sorts of things. And if you were playing those effectively, you were sort of trying to win them in a slightly sort of more upmarket way than I guess, most were. It turned out that the skillset that you acquired doing that was exactly the same skillset you needed to sort of win at DeFi. So, of course, when DeFi summer comes around and the numbers that you're playing for go from being sort of low four figures or whatever, to suddenly there's billions of dollars sloshing through the system. There were a few of us that were just very well placed to take advantage of that, and we did.
00:05:20.630 - 00:05:50.524, Speaker A: Yeah. So, no, it's really interesting how you said you started with, let's say, under $1,000, and now you have this DB or this portfolio that a lot of people track, and you have, according to D Bank, $29.5 million, and you also own a bunch of NFTs. You also mentioned skill sets that allowed you to be successful in DeFi. What are those skill sets that allowed you to just, I guess, manage risk, identify opportunities, et cetera?
00:05:50.692 - 00:06:35.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the grand edge question, where does it come from? How do you get it? The few people that sort of do what I do effectively, and I'm not even entirely sure what that is or how I describe it, I still struggle to explain to people what it is I do. But essentially there are, I don't know, maybe five or six different and quite unique skills that you sort of need to have. And your ability to do it well is sort of glass ceilinged by the one you are worst at, if that makes sense. So you need to have, like, a decently good understanding of programming. Don't have to be brilliant. You know, I still write most of my scripts in j's or whatever. With Ethereum's twelve second block time, you don't necessarily need to be much faster.
00:06:35.290 - 00:07:19.480, Speaker B: There are situations where it makes sense to, but you know it's workable as long as you know your limits. Right? That's another big one. You have to know when you're beaten, because if you don't, you can get locked into fights that you're going to lose, and they can be very costly, and that's obviously bad. You need to have a very decent understanding of sort of incentive models and how people will react to things when presented with different situations. You've got to be just generally quite quick. You know, if you're presented with some sort of system or loop, if you can't understand it very fast or at least faster than the vast majority, if people will, then you're going to have problems as well. So it's this sort of massively sort of diverse set of skills that you kind of need to consistently win.
00:07:19.480 - 00:07:56.040, Speaker B: Edge is often talked about in quite a personal sense. It's sort of like, do you have it or do you not? Whereas I kind of view it as like, where you sit in the stack. You know, there are at any given time so many people looking at something. Right? Where do you sit in the stack of people that are looking at it? You know, if you sort of throw your hat in the ring, are you confident that you'll be able to come away with a win? It's very Pvp in that sense. And I guess sort of trading markets are too, although I don't touch those as much. It's just a lot less explicit. When you're fighting someone for something on chain or whatever, you often sort of form this weird bond.
00:07:56.040 - 00:08:46.340, Speaker B: And yes, all you can see is an address, but sometimes they'll deploy a contract and then you'll have to redeploy yours and you sort of feel like you get to know this person even though you're not really. You're just sort of scrolling through an etherscan page. So, yeah, it's a question that obviously is very important to answer and to understand well, because if you don't necessarily know where your edge comes from, or put it another way, the golden rule should always be that if you don't know you know more, don't touch it. And the situations in which you know you know more will not be that often. Right. There'll be times where it just makes sense to do something because it's small or light or easy. But if you want to go big or you want to, like, actually sort of throw yourself down the risk curve, knowing that you have some sort of information asymmetric advantage is quite important, I'd say.
00:08:47.040 - 00:09:06.260, Speaker A: Yeah. So the bigger your edges, depending on where you think you are in terms of the cycle. Are you early? Early? Are you kind of early? Kind of late? Late. And if you think you're early early, do you think it gives you the ability to bet more? How do you think about position sizing? Because you are throwing your own size.
00:09:06.670 - 00:10:02.140, Speaker B: Yeah. So first point would be that in the early days of the Ponzi schemes, we had this just flat 80 20 rule, or it was kind of an 80 ten rule where 80% lose 10% win a little bit or break even, and then 10% make a lot. And it's not really a hard and fast rule, but it props up quite a lot. You see it all over the place and I'd say it's probably pretty accurate. So you've just got to make sure that you're in that 1st 20% and ideally in that 1st 10%. Obviously with scale, and particularly over the last year, year and a half, two years, it's gotten slightly more complicated because it's been very difficult to find things where it makes sense to be early in the sort of size that I would need to be using for it to be worth my time to try and execute on. Because realistically I could just be running tivo plus with my stack and I'd be making out a lot better than I would be if I were trying to fight obscure mev or whatever.
00:10:02.140 - 00:10:52.196, Speaker B: And that's made it quite difficult. So I tend to focus on the protocols or the things where I'll be able to either farm an outsize percentage of whatever the token is or get some kind of edge through having size. So it means I don't really shitcoin that much. There's no real point in trying to buy these coins early because at max you can get in is a couple of f and the max return is not much higher than that either. But if you get into a farming protocol early where you can really size in, take maybe 60% of the rewards or whatever, if they've got a large reward scheme upfront, you can walk away with a decently mid single figure percentage of the whole. And that can be very valuable. Equally, you can then sit down with the developers and be like, look, there's some incentive alignment here.
00:10:52.196 - 00:11:00.030, Speaker B: I'm not really a team member, but I slightly have become one by nature of how much of this I own. Let's go. Basically.
00:11:00.450 - 00:11:09.506, Speaker A: Yeah. So for example, I'm looking at your wallet now. You have $12 million into Prisma finance. And I think you ate this like day one for a couple hours.
00:11:09.538 - 00:11:51.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I did. Slightly late, annoyingly, but yes, not going super well annoyingly. The idea was this is essentially a similar to sort of LUSd or any of the sort of CDP startup protocols. And the stablecoins in those have sat under peg for a while now, largely because you basically get a free carry trade, you pay a 0.5% fee upfront, you borrow, you take whatever the stable is, in this case MK USD, you sell it for Dai and you stick it in the DSR and you're earning 5% a year, the 0.5% up from fee. So it doesn't take that long, a month and a half and then suddenly you're in profit.
00:11:51.530 - 00:12:37.492, Speaker B: This one's slightly different because they have the ability to sort of change the borrow fee on the troves or the CDP's, which means they should be able to maintain peg a lot easier than liquiti or any of the other systems that have leveraged this style of contract set. Now there's a lag timer on that. It'll take a while for these things to pass through governance and percolate down. But equally I would imagine it will repay quite soon. And then if you're looking at it from like okay, 5% is the risk free rate. Well can I beat that here by buying it under peg? Probably yes. I'd imagine it would repeg slightly sooner than the sort of two or three months that would require buying it at where it sits right now.
00:12:37.492 - 00:13:05.320, Speaker B: So that's just kind of a trade in a way. And it's one where size works because you're not sort of massively limited by you're not going to crush yield on your own, which has been a problem historically. But equally Justin's son I think went in super early as well. And every time he was selling he was sort of knocking the price down about 30% or whatever. So you can, it's just my size isn't really size yet. It's partial of the way that, but not fairly.
00:13:05.980 - 00:13:40.502, Speaker A: So do you view prisma as just a pure farming dump or do you actually see, because I feel like sometimes Justin sun or you ape in size into a protocol and then people are like oh my God, it must be good, right? The devs must be good, they know something. And the token is bullish. Or do you just view it as. Well, it's a pretty good trade. I'll just deposit some dollars in here, maybe do the carry trade, stick some die in the DSR and then with all the rewards I'll just dump it, buy more dai, stake more dai, the DSR, etcetera is that, can I view this type of trade or farm?
00:13:40.566 - 00:14:17.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean this one specifically is very much that it's not, you know, I mean I guess prisma is pretty entrenched or embedded in the curve stack. It seems to be. I was very big into Libra when that sort of started back in say may I guess I wouldn't say it kicked off the sort of LSD. We're doing defi with LSD's narrative, but it was certainly sort of near the beginning, and that paid out very well. And I was like, well. And I hadn't actually done the math on essentially the reward curve decay. So if you go and look at the Prisma price and you put it into the log chart or whatever, it should be more or less a straight line down.
00:14:17.580 - 00:15:00.150, Speaker B: And if you do the math on the rate of that decline versus what you're farming at, you can figure out whether or not it makes sense to farm it based on how fast you lose. You can just do a load of math on it to figure out whether or not it makes sense to pull two or whatever. You can get a little bit scientific about it, so to speak. And over the last, I don't know, two years, it's actually weirdly been better to do that than it was historically beforehand, if that makes sense. I'm not really sure why that is, but it's certainly been true. Part of me feels like, what do.
00:15:00.150 - 00:15:08.490, Speaker A: You mean by better? As in farming and dumping is better than just holding traits. Given that we're in choppy market conditions.
00:15:09.050 - 00:15:33.950, Speaker B: The speed at which the trades decline is slower. You have more time, if that makes sense. And more time is important in these because it can massively change when you're looking at 100% AP wise or whatever, at the start. Getting that for an extra two days is massively important because it's an extra percent ish.
00:15:35.720 - 00:15:36.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:36.320 - 00:15:43.380, Speaker B: And that can sort of very materially change how the trade looks, I guess, the math on it.
00:15:43.840 - 00:16:06.662, Speaker A: Yeah. So as you mentioned earlier, you started out with not that much capital, and I guess you were kind of trading around stuff, 2018, 2019, and then of course, Defi Summer hit 2020. And I guess you were early to a bunch of things. Do you have any favorite memories of Defi Summer or just like the 2020 2021 bull market that you're wanting to share?
00:16:06.686 - 00:16:56.328, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember. So I guess the curve launch was quite fun. There's a sort of a load of backstory there, which I guess is probably becoming more and more public as the years go on. But essentially the curve team weren't really allowed to launch curve and then some weird, but they put all the contracts and sort of the deployment code into a sort of a GitHub and some random Twitter account gets spun up, deploys the whole thing, and then sort of sits back. Now, curve is written, obviously, in Viper, which sort of screwed them a few months ago, but at that point wasn't really used by anyone. So no one really understood how to read it or what was going on, but I sort of muddled through it and figured out how to sort of deposit into these pools and basically was able to get four or 5 hours of curve farm entirely to myself. And at that point, I wasn't entirely sure whether or not it was the real curve either.
00:16:56.328 - 00:17:59.786, Speaker B: It was this sort of weird, like, is it worth something? Do we buy it? Do we not? But I have the first transfers of curve. I made the curve like uniswap pools, and we're sort of selling curve about $20 a pop, I think, at the very start, trying to offload it anywhere I could because I was pretty sure that within a few hours they were like, nope, this is not the real one, or whatever. But that was quite enjoyable. I think some of the early snipes sniping is pretty well understood now by most people that sort of do this, but equally right at the start, when no one had really done it before, it was quite a novel and unique thing, and it was an incredibly valuable skill to have and kind of tail end of 2020 because so few people knew how to do it. And there were so many coins launching at these absurd capitalizations that you could make out incredibly well. And some of the larger ones of those are always going to be nice to look back on and think about. And equally, thats how I made a lot of my money, was sitting there f at 400 or whatever it was.
00:17:59.786 - 00:18:18.770, Speaker B: You kept all the profit from those in ether and waited until it went up. Its a ten x on anything you made sniping or running around in those days, if that was profitable anyway. And you can just ten x it by sitting there. Yeah, that was the easiest win. There's a load of other things, like fey tribe protocol.
00:18:18.890 - 00:18:19.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:21.290 - 00:19:11.906, Speaker B: The launch of that was just a bit special, I'll say. And indeed, it got saved at the bell. It would have been a lot worse if someone hadn't noticed what was going to happen, but essentially because of the way that they'd structured it with a penalty fee, if you tried to sell when the coin was under peg, if you were first through sort of the loop of like, claim the fey, claim the tribe, settle the tribe, sell the whole thing and just get out, you could push the price of the stable down far enough that nobody else could sell at all because the fee was going to be too high. So was able to basically lock up one and a half billion dollars worth of capital just like that. With not that much sort of effort on my part, I think it was sort of a single script that was just front running any transaction in the window where they were launching. That was quite funny.
00:19:12.098 - 00:19:18.570, Speaker A: It was a weird one, weren't they? The one that raised like a billion dollars or some egregious amount? Right.
00:19:18.690 - 00:19:51.906, Speaker B: It was quite a sort of clever launch. And that basically what happened was they were like, look, you deposit ether into this pool, when we launch, we will give you an equivalent amount of a stable coin, and then we'll then pool a load up on the back end. But more than that, we will also give you a proportional amount of, like, the governance token tribe. So if you deposited quite late, it should theoretically have just been free money. But of course, what happens there is that the coin just dumps massively at launch because no one actually wants to hold it. They just wanted to get the free money. But then it also had this system wherein you were penalized if you tried to sell the stablecoin under peg.
00:19:51.906 - 00:20:14.080, Speaker B: So it just seized up basically instantly until they had to go ahead and remove the penalty. And then, of course, it sort of collapsed in fashion a couple of years later. And the fight over that was also quite fun, where the tribe developer team wanted to buy out Rari.
00:20:14.380 - 00:20:15.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that.
00:20:15.260 - 00:20:41.720, Speaker B: For some absurd capitalization, and there were enough of us tribe holders who had enough side. They were like, this is not going to happen unless you let us out. Right? You give us a pro rata value of the treasury, and eventually we got the pro art of value of the treasury and they bought Rari out, and then it was hacked about two weeks later, and they were all hooked for that. And the whole thing just sort of fell apart. But that was quite interesting.
00:20:42.020 - 00:20:53.440, Speaker A: Yeah, it seemed like all the crazy launches or maybe like the crazy stuff in 2021 just came back down to earth, basically raised a billion dollars.
00:20:55.510 - 00:21:21.530, Speaker B: Frothy time. Nothing ever really made sense. And the entire time you were doing it, you were sort of looking at these things and the numbers associated, and you were like, well, none of this really makes any sense. I'm not going to complain, you know, I'm making a lot of money, but equally, it feels wrong. And, you know, sure enough, in a way, it sort of was. Defi is interesting, but it is effectively a primitive. That was zero sum.
00:21:21.530 - 00:21:56.100, Speaker B: And the further on it went and the more the skill stack spread out, if you like, and the people at the top won more and more and more. Like anything, like any game, if you cheat or you're very good at it, no one's going to want to play with you. After a while. And of course, that's what happens when the profits are sort of split between the 20% at the top of the stack and everyone else gets shafted. Eventually, the pool runs out of steam and liquidity, and the whole thing sort of collapses down. Yeah, in a way, but was fun to do while it lasted.
00:21:56.760 - 00:22:06.344, Speaker A: There were a lot of things that made no sense. I remember I was farming on polygon. I don't know if you ever used polygon, but these goose finance forks with those 4% deposit fees.
00:22:06.512 - 00:22:10.240, Speaker B: Yeah, the deposit fee kept going up, the rates kept going up.
00:22:10.400 - 00:22:12.080, Speaker A: I know. Yeah.
00:22:12.160 - 00:22:31.760, Speaker B: Remember farming titan iron on polygon when Mark Cuban got screwed? And of course, that was the model that Luna then went and copied. So having been deeply involved in that and then seeing Luna come around, I'm like, nope, I've seen this happen before. I know exactly what happens. And to sit for about a year and a half watching it go up until it did ultimately, eventually collapse.
00:22:32.620 - 00:23:04.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember iron finance. I think Alameda deposited low to mid nine figures pretty early on, and that kind of created this massive fomo rush into iron finance, and I was covering it on my channel. I was like, yo, like, this thing's gonna collapse. But I think it went from, like, $0, like $20, and then at some point, like, you know, obviously it went to zero. There was, like, some bug. But when you think about Defi, you mentioned that, you know, it's pretty fun, or, you know, it's. If you were early, right, you could have made money.
00:23:04.050 - 00:23:12.318, Speaker A: What is your bull case for Defi? You know, why are you still here? If you have enough money, you know, you can't be doing anything else with your life.
00:23:12.334 - 00:24:05.396, Speaker B: Right? I. Yeah, I mean, you say that it's not entirely true, in a way. I'm still quite young, but the sort of lifestyle that this required for a very long time was one of which you sat in a room for 16 hours a day, seven days a week, taking no breaks, particularly if you were doing the kind of early, what would then become or be known as Mev stuff. An hour taken out was an hour and a half that you were going to have to spend getting back up to scratch. So literally going out for a meal was going to materially cost you in time. And you do that for long enough, it slightly breaks you in a way. I've always been a sort of solo operator, so it was having to do everything on my own, and that was fun in a way, but it cost me in other ways that were, I wouldn't necessarily want to do it again, but equally it kind of breaks a lot of the other sort of simple things in life for you.
00:24:05.396 - 00:25:14.244, Speaker B: I don't think I'll ever be able to get a normal job now just because it will never really be able to match the. I wouldn't say the enjoyment necessarily, but the degree of fight of all the sort of things we've sort of already discussed that you just don't really get anywhere else. It's like this massively meritocratic, no safety net game, theoretical system that we managed to build where if you were good and you could win, you could really win. And how can anything ever really compare to that? You can do all sorts of stuff, and I do. I've sort of got slightly into adventure tourism over the last couple of years and have done some pretty interesting things in that time. But yet I look at what I spend my time doing, and I do still spend 8910 hours a day floating through contracts, you know, on ether scan, reading around, trying to find stuff to like to break or hoops to jump through or whatever, to try and find some edge or get ahead of the curve. It's just a lot of fun.
00:25:14.244 - 00:25:25.480, Speaker B: You know, there isn't really a stronger answer than that. I am but a set of chemicals that wants a thing and that thing is enjoyment. And that's why I'm here.
00:25:26.230 - 00:25:32.490, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair. Going back to the previous question, do you have a bull case for defi?
00:25:34.390 - 00:26:15.580, Speaker B: Sort of. There's a point at which you kind of top out the degree of abstraction you can kind of get away with, because the human brain or the average human brain can only get away with so much leverage or sort of tiers in the system of abstraction. And we've sort of topped that out a while ago. I think, you know, every, every incremental gain from here in terms of, like, structure of protocol or primitive is usually quite incremental. It's not like a sort of. No one's launching a new one. I mean, like, you know, I've completely changed the game again.
00:26:15.580 - 00:27:20.792, Speaker B: And that's fine, you know, because when you look at crypto generally, you have to ask yourself, well, what does it do? And as much as the people that talk to regulators day in, day out or whatever in Washington or wherever else in the world like to argue that it's actually not a good thing and it's not all criminal, really. What we do is regulatory arbitrage. That's kind of it. We exist outside of the rails that governments have sort of control over. And that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think it's often sort of looked at as a bad thing, but I don't think that's true because it really just depends on how important you think things like regulatory arbitrage will be going forward. And I have this sort of, I'd say longer term thesis, if you like, that as the world gets much less unipolar, as us dominance falls, as differing sort of economic standards start to appear, we sit in this weird little gray zone in the middle that could end up being quite valuable just because it allows you to bridge all of these systems, countries, whatever systems of thought, without having to explicitly allow it.
00:27:20.792 - 00:28:11.066, Speaker B: It just exists on the side. No one has control over it. It's like no man's land for economies, if you like. And that's quite valuable, or at least I think it could be. So when you say, well, what's the bull case? I think it's that I think that we will see, I won't say a collapse necessarily, but a fragmentation of the global economy, which we sort of started to already. Right. If you look at the US bond market, for instance, they are having trouble, or at least the reason that rates went up so much was in part that they were having trouble selling all of this debt to foreign nations who historically bought a lot of it, China, Japan, the Japans, because of the yield control, but India, whatever.
00:28:11.066 - 00:29:16.314, Speaker B: And after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the US sort of freezing down their assets, a lot of these countries kind of looked at their balance sheets and like, well, okay, we hold a lot of us debt here. And given that they're effectively now flexing this muscle that they historically haven't really flexed, does that make sense? Does it make sense to be so exposed to the US? And a lot of them have been saying, well, not really. And so the US sits there and it's, for the first time in a very long time, kind of in a fight for credit. It needs to attract customers to borrow against. And if you kind of extrapolate out this idea, 510, 15 years or whatever, and where does it go? I'm not entirely sure where it goes, but I don't think it's going to be a sort of hardening of these systems along the lines of where they exist now. I think it'll just fragment more. And I think that however that happens, it'll end up being some kind of like, gray economic system that sits in the middle and bridges the gaps.
00:29:16.314 - 00:29:26.230, Speaker B: And that's probably going to be us, or at least at the moment, if you were a betting man, you'd probably bet on this. So that's the case. It just continues to exist basically.
00:29:26.700 - 00:29:49.884, Speaker A: I see. And wouldn't that be somewhat of a bull case for bitcoin and also stable coins like bitcoin as this alternate store value and then stable coins as the last buyer of us debt. Right. We have maker and all these tokenized treasury products just converting or just tokenized treasuries, let's say. Yeah. Do you want to expand on that?
00:29:50.052 - 00:30:26.334, Speaker B: Yes, I mean know, bitcoin has only really existed in a time period where we've basically had peace. Right. The peace dividend has definitely been around since at least zero eight and probably quite a long time before that. The US has never really been severely threatened since, I don't know, the fall of the Soviet Union probably, and China is sort of rising now. But equally the US has such a vast lead in at least military capabilities that we have a while. But as the peace dividend starts to wither. Yeah, I think that is massively bullish for bitcoin.
00:30:26.334 - 00:30:53.036, Speaker B: There comes a point where, okay, if the whole world gets destroyed, then good luck with whos going to replace with the undersea cables or whatever. And your bitcoin is now effectively invalidated and gold is probably the better way to go. It was Einstein that said that. I dont know what weapons World War three will be fought with, but world War four will be fought with sticks and stones, which makes sense. And there was kind of a bare case there. But generally, as long as you're not being sort of super eschatological about it. Yeah, I think it's probably bullish for bitcoin.
00:30:53.036 - 00:31:43.570, Speaker B: And then of course in the sort of intermediate term, the US dollar I think maintains supremacy because there isn't really anything else that can take its position. I travel in a lot of places that are quite. I don't know how to say this, but unstable. Probably central banks that aren't as strong and occasionally default, or places that don't really even have central banks at all and their governments have more or less collapsed. And a lot of these people, what do they store their value in? It is usually things like gold or dollars. The dollar is still massively useful in most of the world. There are very few countries outside of the west that you can go to where if you turn up somewhere, they won't accept dollars as payment.
00:31:43.570 - 00:32:34.000, Speaker B: But as the dollar starts to inflate a little bit, eventually that becomes less interesting because you're still getting screwed over. If rates are up to about five, 6% and realistically, inflation is running a little hotter than that which you would expect it to. That's not ideal. And one of the more interesting things I think that will come out of the next couple of years that we built will be these carry trade systems through what has been known as RWA, where, let's say you own a load of the turkish lira or something, which the inflation rate on that at the moment is really high, around 50% or more, and has been higher in the past as well. They've had some pretty interesting economic policy. You don't really want to hold the turkish lira. It's not a very good store of value.
00:32:34.000 - 00:33:30.130, Speaker B: So what do you want to hold? Well, maybe euros or dollars or whatever, but equally, the turkish government really don't want you to do that. They need you holding those lira because that's how they buy stuff and spend in the international markets. So you kind of got to get out of the lira, get into dollars, and then you're probably going to want some yield on top of that as well. And where can you do that? Well, the only place that I know of certainly is crypto. And there's this really interesting phenomenon that I find when sort of talking to people about this, usually sort of us based VC's or whoever, who don't necessarily fully understand just how difficult it is to deal with all of the kind of KYC regulations and access to these products that you can't use unless you are inside the system. And it's a market that has never really been tapped before. This just hasn't existed.
00:33:30.130 - 00:34:19.120, Speaker B: The globalization of finance isn't really a thing yet. It slightly is, but it only is if you were already quite globalized anyway. If you weren't, you stored your cash in gold or whatever the currency of the country you're in was in. And if it blew up, then it blew up. And that was your lot in life holding the peso in Argentina or the ghanaian central bank just revealed a massive fraud last week, wherever you are. And yeah, this is a use case in a way, and it's one that, that hasn't really existed before you go, okay, what's the bull case for Defi? Well, you kind of look at it in reverse. Where do we have to get to such that it's obvious that it's one.
00:34:19.120 - 00:35:07.136, Speaker B: I've always said that if the whole thing just disappears tomorrow, someone breaks elliptic curve cryptography, the US bans it, whatever. What happens? What's the jeopardy there? Well, at the moment, really, it's that a bunch of 20 to 35 year old white and asian guys lose their jobs and have to go work in a bank or whatever? Or whatever. And that isn't ideal. It's not good. How do you get to the point where the whole system becomes existentially risky enough that it can't just be collapsed, that no one actually wants it to fail? Because that would have far reaching consequences if we can find a way of pulling so much capital and wealth into the system. And it wouldn't necessarily, I think, be these sort of massive institutions that people are always looking out for. That's how you get there.
00:35:07.136 - 00:35:09.032, Speaker B: That's the win condition, right?
00:35:09.216 - 00:36:01.720, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think the next wave of defi adoption isn't going to come from, let's say, new protocol designs, because we already have uniswap Aave Lido? I feel like there's not much you can do on top of that. But do you think that the way DeFi becomes more anti fragile, let's say, because you mentioned that maybe right now DeFi is a fragile system. If it goes to zero, then I'm out of a job. You'll be sad, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not going to affect the global economy. But the only way for DeFi to become really important, to, let's say, the us dollar dominance and whatnot, is if the amount of on chain stable coins exceeded, let's say, 100 billion or 200 billion, even like a trillion. Is that kind of how you view the next adoption of crypto and how more dollars flow on chain?
00:36:02.060 - 00:36:44.420, Speaker B: Well, if it's going to happen, that kind of has to be how it happens, right? Like, either it does or it doesn't. And if it doesn't, then, you know, okay, I guess we ramble along here for a while until eventually the pool of liquidity has become so small that there's sort of no point doing it anymore. The bitcoiners win. Oh, if it does happen, then, yeah, that's how I see it happening. Or at least I don't really see a path that makes sense any other way. Like you said, we topped out what the EVM can do. We have basically a very slow piece of accounting software that you can access from anywhere in the world without permissionless.
00:36:44.420 - 00:37:12.108, Speaker B: There's only so much you can really do with that. We talked it out quite early. Everything, as I said, past that point is just small. All iterations and tiny upgrades that, yeah, okay, might be upgrades, but equally they're not. You know, they're not game changing. They're not strong enough on their own back to sort of draw people in. They're really just a medium and a way that people can interact once they're in, but you have to draw them in with something else.
00:37:12.108 - 00:37:21.720, Speaker B: And I think setting them yield, be it the us dollar or sort of us debt in other regards, or just sort of western debt in general, is probably the best way of doing that.
00:37:22.030 - 00:38:20.092, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. So I want to pivot to, I guess, just going through your portfolio. I guess you own a lot of stable coins and you're farming with it, but it seems like your biggest bets when it comes to altcoins seems to be one kanto. And then you also have, I believe, yeah, like $4 million ish worth of maker. I'm just curious because I mean, obviously you just told me your longer term theses on why tokenized treasuries and rwas are going to be important. But how do you get to this point? How do you build the conviction for you to say, you know what, Canto is not that liquid, but im going to buy up to $3 million worth of it? What is your process like to get to this point and how do you manage your conviction? How do you keep up with invalidation of the trade? And what is your average time horizon when it comes to these types of trades, let's say, or theses probably makes.
00:38:20.116 - 00:38:57.752, Speaker B: Sense to start with maker. And that was born of a phenomenon that I'm sure everyone that is listening to this will be aware of. That is when you sort of, if you ever sort of fall into one of those discussions with perhaps an older person or whatever about crypto, you know, their understanding and conception of it will be very much based on when they found out about it and what they read about it at the time. Right. So for a long time it would have been like a 2013 tier like bitcoin mining sort of type article, and that's what they'd want to discuss. And then 2017, it might be about monkey pictures or nfts or whatever, and make. It was weirdly like that.
00:38:57.752 - 00:39:40.280, Speaker B: If we rewind about a year, I remember looking at it and being like, there is a plan laid out here that seems to be in motion as far as I can tell. And maker is quite a sort of opaque system. You basically have to go through this governance forum and dig out 50, 60 different little pages of text to really understand what's going on. And I sort of shift it all into something called the atlas, but it is very hard to get a read on. But if you did and you sat there and you did the work. You came away with this idea that, hang on a second, in, I don't know, six months time. This is a protocol that's probably going to be making around $80 million a year in profit.
00:39:40.280 - 00:40:17.654, Speaker B: That is absurd. That is worth quite a lot of money. And much like the sort of, well, isn't crypto just bitcoin mining thing? A lot of people, when maker first announced a pivot back, and I think it was 2020, called Endgame, it was a bit insane. There were parts of that that genuinely didn't make much sense. The AI drone ships piece is one that sort of stands out. And it all sounded a bit insane and mad. And for a long time, until sort of recently, I'd argue, most people's understanding of where maker was going was based around that.
00:40:17.654 - 00:40:39.646, Speaker B: It was sort of this harebrained scheme that probably wasn't going to work. And no one just really seemed to notice that over the sort of the year and a half that followed, it had materially changed. Like, the plan was very different. So I sort of sat there looking at maker very low. The answer is about 0.35, I think, on the earth ratio. I just decided that I hadn't really seen anyone else talking about this.
00:40:39.646 - 00:41:19.210, Speaker B: It was not a well known thing and that the market was wrong. I just started buying, basically. I think I just probably got up to about a position size where I felt comfortable as a percentage of my portfolio and then stopped and held. Canto was slightly different, because canto was very much a farm coin for me. The bridge, I dont know if youve played with it years ago, but the bridge even today, is still not ideal. But back then it was a lot worse and it held a lot of people out. But what it meant was that the stable pools paid a very, very good rate for a very long time.
00:41:19.210 - 00:42:11.742, Speaker B: So it was one of those ones where it was very easy to acquire. Not easy, but if you had size, it was easy to acquire a decent amount of it just through farming. And at that point, okay, we have incentive alignment. Does it make sense now to try and start pushing this or trying to make it a thing? So that's kind of how the canto position became a position. Equally, Canto is Scott Lewis baby, to an extent, and he is someone I respect very deeply and has, or is someone that is consistently trying to push the bounds of what we're doing. You know, there's very little in his, I don't know, book of or list of things that he's done and achieved that were iterative or small upgrades. He's very much about that.
00:42:11.742 - 00:42:28.920, Speaker B: Okay, how do we build something completely novel and new? And I just find that quite attractive and interesting, or at least, you know, there's a very high chance that something that does work out in the end and become very big is something that, that he has had a hand. So aligning myself with that idea and that mind, if you like, just felt sensible.
00:42:30.580 - 00:43:03.246, Speaker A: It seems like you're very patient when it comes to, for example, Maker. You were monitoring the governance forums and you identified that, hey, in six months, let's say their profit estimates are going to hit 80 million. And so let's try to front run that narrative. And I guess for Canto, you knew Scott Lewis, there was pretty high stablecoin yields. So that was a wait for you to accumulate a position. Maybe you bought some pretty recently. Let me share my screen again to talk about the dbank stuff.
00:43:03.246 - 00:43:26.770, Speaker A: But on Kanto, you're basically doing the carry trade right now. You have like $5 million worth of t bill token UsyC, you borrow some notes, like, does using these protocols make you more convinced or more convicted in these types of trades? Or are you just trying to just literally do the carry trade and make money from it?
00:43:28.470 - 00:44:25.242, Speaker B: I'm very much a learn on the job sort of person. I find that the fastest way to just learn about things is to use them. And it's much easier to sort of form or like, let's say that to create a functional narrative in your head, you need to jump through like nine nodes. If you can achieve the first four or five nodes by just using the thing, then it makes sense to just use it. If you have to kind of try and extrapolate out in your head how the first five are going to work, you are much less likely to reach the 9th point or whatever to come up with some idea that makes sense. So, yeah, I do enjoy using things just to see how they work and see in a broader sense if they will work going forward. If I find some primitive that is a little bit novel, okay, having used this a bit, I can see like a mass market appeal, or I can see how it would work with some slight changes, and then I can sort of poll and look for in the future that slight specific change and then go in big when I see it or it happens.
00:44:25.242 - 00:45:03.892, Speaker B: So that's definitely true. Part of it was just genuinely interesting, like the idea of being able to hold. I mean, USYC is reverse repo as a reverse repo facility specifically. So there's no duration risk on it, which is quite interesting to me. It was like, okay, how does this work? Equally, the sort of pid rate on note, which is the stablecoin you borrow against the USYC, is quite novel. One of my favorite protocols to come out of DeFi was reflexer, which can't ever really work for disparate other reasons. But the model itself and the way that it stabilizes itself, I thought was very cool.
00:45:03.892 - 00:45:26.850, Speaker B: And notice, similar ish to that. The term algo stable gets a very bad rap nowadays, but that's more a case of it being very easy to make one that is just a flat Ponzi, and that, of course, will eventually collapse that it is anything inherently wrong with the idea of one itself. So, yeah.
00:45:29.150 - 00:46:07.118, Speaker A: Got it, got it. I want to pivot the topic to nfts because I also noticed that you own a bunch of nfts. So let me just pull up your. So this is a little blur, but it looks like you own 20 punks. A bunch of 323 me bits, 285 redacted vermilion babies. And, I mean, there's a lot here. How do you view nfts? Are you bullish? Are you just collecting them? Is it a trade? Do you think they'll recover? Where are you at when it comes to are you bullish? Nfts?
00:46:07.214 - 00:46:48.102, Speaker B: Nfts me bits of my Everest. Yes. It probably makes sense to rewind a bit here and go back to the 2019 Ponzi scheme era. And as that was tailing off, there was a very clear bifurcation where one side of that sort of grouping went and became Defi people and the other side went and became NFT people. But a lot of it stems from the sort of groups that existed back then. So a lot of us that were sort of there at the start kind of bridged the gap, you know, or at least were there quite early. I mean, I bought the punk floor at about dollar 69, I think, so very, very early, and had been watching them for a lot longer than that.
00:46:48.102 - 00:47:48.922, Speaker B: It was just a case of, like, you know, I was there, and it was lucky. The mebits thing was a trade specifically where I just. I was minting them as they launched and was selling the rare ones and was just rolling any profit back into buying more of them, and then just never really sold them since then, which was not an ideal trade, I will be honest. I should have definitely sold them much earlier than I did and have sort of held them down. And I sort of slightly, oh, I joke that they're my memento mori, you know, they're my. They're the one trade that I've held all the way down despite knowing I really shouldn't do, as a reminder that I'm very capable of making very bad decisions sometimes. NFTs generally are quite interesting because for a long time they were quite obviously the use case in a way, and more so in a way that they kind of allow ether to win over all of the other chains than win out generally, just because, you know, if someone owns an NFT on Ethereum, they're kind of locked into Ethereum.
00:47:48.922 - 00:48:08.674, Speaker B: You can sort of kind of try and bridge them. But, you know, particularly for the older ones where, you know, provenance matters, like punks, it's. You're stuck here now, like, this is, this is where you live. But I feel kind of. That's possibly less true now than it was before. Generally, I don't think about them that much at all. You know, I very rarely touch them or trade them.
00:48:08.674 - 00:48:37.320, Speaker B: And a lot of what I own is just a. The case of like, I bought it when it was small and I kind of like the look of it and now it's just kind of sat there. I don't really include it in my portfolio, valuations or whatever. And it's just a thing that if it pans out in the long run, then cool. I think that if Ethereum truly does end up working in a way that I hope it might, then things like punks should end up being quite valuable. And equally, if it doesn't, it doesn't. So it's just kind of like ether beta but with pictures attached.
00:48:37.640 - 00:48:55.260, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Like, what do you think about things like bored apes versus punks? Right. Because punks, it's more of this historical relic, whereas this new generation of pfps, they're trying to create utility. Are you just not into that? And are you like just more into art and punks and art blocks and whatnot?
00:48:56.000 - 00:49:28.812, Speaker B: Kind of. I mean, it's probably definitely true. Equally. Yeah, I mean, the discussions there have been had ad nauseam all over the place. If nothing else, I just found the whole thing quite cringe from start to finish. I think it kind of was objectively quite cringe and probably ended up doing the system a disservice. I feel like NFT is a very loaded term now and they're probably a large reason or large part of the reason why I.
00:49:28.812 - 00:49:59.672, Speaker B: Which was probably quite damaging. But, you know, without them, would it have got as big as it did? Well, I don't know, you know, it's pushes and pulls. God gives with one hand and takes with the other. You know, I'd never own an ape. I did actually own apes because I was farming blur and got saddled with a few of them, but would never sort of buy and own one. But equally, it's probably true of just sort of NFTs generally, punks are kind of a special case. I just have hold those for so long that they're kind of part of me now.
00:49:59.672 - 00:50:24.540, Speaker B: And equally, you know, like my famous one, the 9998, technically the most expensive piece of art ever sold, depending on what metric you use and how you define sold, I guess, you know, that's going to be with me for life, I'd imagine. So. I think the transaction that I used to sort of flash loan buy it was cost about 4k, but equally it cost the punk as well because there's no way I can really sell it now.
00:50:25.600 - 00:50:56.870, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. Yeah. Let me just do a viewer audience question here. So you already answered some of this, but you started with, let's say under $1,000 and you got to where you are now. But what are some key milestones and pivotal moments that you thought was very important for you to get to where you are now? What is your edge? And some biggest lessons and takeaways to find your edge, I guess some advice to the audience, let's say, if you can touch on these topics here.
00:50:58.130 - 00:51:43.130, Speaker B: So I'd say sometime back in 2019, I ended up finding what is now known as the maker purple paper, but it is incredibly difficult to find, and I haven't been able to find it for a while. But it was written by, I think, Roon, and it was basically the sort of tokenization thesis, but fleshed out in a way that I hadn't really seen written before. And reading that was enough to basically make me realize that this probably made sense. And it would make sense to sort of sit down and learn to code and a bunch of other things and really go all in. And that's what I did. I dropped out of school and got lost in a way that up to that point, I'd been very much like, this is a side thing I'm doing while I do everything else. And then it became the main thing I was doing, and everything else became side.
00:51:43.130 - 00:52:35.150, Speaker B: So that was there. And then I guess this kind of six week period over Defi summer where it went from being a slight kind of like, I've made a mistake here, and this was probably not a wise decision to have made to being like, no it's going to work. Like I was right, I just was slightly early, although I wasn't really right. I just got lucky in a sense, and had happened to acquire all the skills I needed to win purely by luck rather than by sort of any deliberate intention. And that was quite important, even if slightly wrong. And then the rest of the way, it's been very sort of, you know, iterative. It's not, there haven't been any sort of massively standout moments where I was like, you know, okay, here is a decision I'm going to make and run with it.
00:52:35.150 - 00:53:14.302, Speaker B: I generally believe that most people in life don't really make hard decisions. You just tend to take the path of least resistance at the time when you're making, you know, choice. And to a great extent, I think that's true of me as well. A lot of what I've done has just been a case of like, at the time it made sense to do it, so I've done it. The only one that really sort of stands out is deciding to sort of quit school and go all in. That was the sort of the furthest down the risk curve decision I've made, really, I think, in my life turned out to be a good one, although possibly not for the reasons I thought it would be. Yeah.
00:53:14.302 - 00:54:04.012, Speaker B: My edge, as discussed before, it's that subset of things that are required and your ability to be good is based on how bad you are or the one you are least good at. And I just happen to have all of them to some degree, or at least kind of all of them to some degree. Defi games when you play them sort of the level that I do and nothing are not. They're not really like anything else I've ever seen. They're not really like trading or anything like that. It's a very different sort of game. It's much like playing a strategy game or something than it is to trading where you're up against some set of people and you know what their wants are because everyone wants the same thing.
00:54:04.012 - 00:54:11.430, Speaker B: It's just more so that. So the game theory is quite a, I would say, easy to map out, but it is very mappable.
00:54:14.850 - 00:54:15.866, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah.
00:54:16.018 - 00:54:49.610, Speaker B: And if you just sort of attack the problem and you're good enough to win consistently and just sort of take it one step further than everyone else can, then yeah, that's the edge. There's no specific single thing that you can really talk about. Yeah. It's like if you get sort of sit one of those verbal reasoning tests as a kid or whatever, and you're just, you know, you can nail a question subconsciously. That's probably a good sign. You know, it sort of requires a whole host of different skills to do that, and if you're able to, then. Cool.
00:54:49.610 - 00:55:01.006, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry, I still struggle to describe it. You know, four years in, it's not a sort of very easy, easily digestible problem to explain.
00:55:01.198 - 00:55:24.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I think maybe the lesson here is that people should just mess around with crypto just because it's so new. No one really knows how things work. Just experiment with multiple things and just, over time, find out what you're good at, and once you do find what you're good at, maybe push that edge. And if you can't explain your edge, then you probably don't have an edge. Would you say that's kind of in line with how you got here?
00:55:25.330 - 00:55:52.440, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. It's definitely true. If you don't know, you know more. Don't touch it unless you're willing to. Just to lose in the name of experimentation, which is equally important to an extent. But, yeah, a lot of what we do is very much just flipping a coin over and over and over. And sometimes you get six heads in a row and you feel like you've nailed it, but really, you just flip six heads in a row.
00:55:52.440 - 00:56:15.390, Speaker B: There wasn't much behind it, and it's important to be cognizant of that as well. A lot of people like to sort of stare at charts all day and draw lines or whatever and think that they've kind of, like, seen patterns in the tea leaves, and maybe they do. Again, I don't really consider myself a trader, but just be wary would be my sort of advice, in a way.
00:56:16.490 - 00:56:49.300, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think about trading versus investing? It seems like, for example, with maker and Kanto, there are more investments, whereas for things like Libra Prisma, there are more trades where I. I mean, you're just depositing stable coins, but it's a trade where you're taking your harvests, your humble yields, and just dumping it in the open market. Do you think people are better off investing in today's climate, given the market conditions? Or what do you think about trading versus investing, and how has your mindset shifted in the past four years?
00:56:51.120 - 00:57:12.764, Speaker B: Wow, that's a big question. Yeah. I mean, you're definitely right in that the sort of maker Kanto style things are much more investments than they are trades. Certainly Kanto would have a lot of trouble offloading that much. Same with maker, though. I mean, it's a lot thicker than it was because of the smart burn engine. Yeah, the smartburn engine.
00:57:12.764 - 00:58:11.696, Speaker B: But still, it's not a position I'm just going to dump one day and move on with my life. It's become a sort of a large part of how I view the space moving forward, and equally just feels like a really good trade to be in at the moment, what with where it's headed. Yeah, they're just two very different things. There's not really much overlap at all. A lot of the sort of the prismas or the libraries of the world really are just, okay. If I lay everything out on the table and I sort of, you know, make us some sort of, like, MacGyver machine or whatever, where you push a block, it moves a ball, the ball touches something else, and you run it through as far as you can to its sort of nash equilibrium or logical conclusion, and you sort of go, okay, where does this end up then? Yeah, if you go, okay, it's going to make sense to put six mil in here, wait three weeks, farm it out and then walk away then, sure, do it. Why would you not? There's no longer term thesis behind that.
00:58:11.696 - 00:59:22.774, Speaker B: It's that someone has built a game that exists on chain that is sort of clearly delineated and defined, and if you figure out how it's best played, then just play it right. Make it canto, whatever. They're much less closed loop, a lot more open ended, and require different things to go correct. A good way to look at training, or I've always thought has been, when you enter into it, is it something that. You need a lot of things to go right for it to work, or is it something that if something goes wrong, it doesn't work and you really want it to be the latter one, where if you imagine it kind of like, oh, like you watch it play out and you need a, b and c to happen, and then that leads to de and f, and then whatever, each of those little nodes in the sort of the tree, if you need, like, the correct branch to be taken every time for your thesis to play out, and then for you, naturally, to win, not necessarily ideal. Whereas if it exists and you can see where it's headed and okay, if x happens, the government bans it or whatever, and that's how you lose, that's a much better trade to be in. So, for maker, it's kind of like, well, they're making $80 million a year.
00:59:22.774 - 00:59:49.046, Speaker B: It's quite hard to screw that up. Doable. It's definitely doable. But it's hard, right? The way that you lose there is the government shuts you down. There are a few other options, but that's your risk set. And I quite like that trade. It just feels nice on paper, whereas I'm trying to think of one that would be the opposite of that, where, I don't know, like Sol or whatever, you buy it on the sort of condition where you think, okay, it's going to kid ethereum or something, which feels quite unlikely.
00:59:49.046 - 01:00:16.772, Speaker B: Right. You need a lot of disparate things to happen in conjunction with each other for it to make sense and pan out that way for it to work. Now, you don't actually need to be correct. You can win completely accidentally. It's the flipping the coin thing again. But equally, if you're sort of entering a trade on a thesis that requires seven things to happen that are all quite unlikely in conjunction with each other, it's probably not a great trade to be in or not a great investment to make. So when it comes to investing, that's kind of how I tend to look at it.
01:00:16.772 - 01:00:32.080, Speaker B: I'm trying to find the things that just feel on paper like they're the most likely to happen the way I think they are. The search space of causal density or whatever is much lower.
01:00:33.620 - 01:01:08.874, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Maybe the other way to put it is just keep it simple. I think I read. I've been reading market wizards like, the book to prepare for these interviews, but there was a line that said, if you can't explain why you're holding an asset in four sentences or less, then you shouldn't be holding that asset. And I think that kind of goes along with what you just mentioned with the nodes. And if you need all these things to happen for your thesis to play out, then you're just, like, hoping, yeah, it's probably not going to happen. Whereas for, let's say, maker, it's, people want to earn yield on dollars, and.
01:01:09.002 - 01:01:16.670, Speaker B: They can clip a yield $80 million. Yeah. Yeah, essentially. That's quite an astute way of viewing it, I'd say. Yeah.
01:01:17.170 - 01:01:38.680, Speaker A: Yeah. So it seems like you're a very rational, measured person from, like, after talking to you for an hour. But how important, how important do you think gut feel is when it comes to just crypto or just trading or investing in general? Or do you just think more rationally and you try not to make more gut feel emotional decisions?
01:01:40.300 - 01:02:12.850, Speaker B: For a while, at least. I own the most expensive failed transaction on a blockchain ever, I'd imagine, because I couldn't see one being bigger than the one that I pulled off on ethereum elsewhere. A lot of it historically has been gut feel, or at least when you're sitting staring at a contract set, whatever. And I'm not really an auditor, I'm not good enough to audit stuff, but I can find the odd bug or the odd sort of screw up. But sometimes you can just look at things and they don't feel right. I can't tell you specifically how it's going to get broken. I can't tell you why it's going to get broken, but it feels like it's going to get broken.
01:02:12.850 - 01:02:55.940, Speaker B: One obvious exception to that would be GMX, which I have thought for years would get broken, and it still hasn't. But that has been quite important to me, being able to sort of sit and very quickly decide whether or not this is a skip or not. And equally, there's sort of less jeopardy there for me, because if I'm wrong and I skip, it doesn't matter, right. I've just not earned some small percentage of the yield I would have made that year. And life goes on, I find something else. But if you deposit and things go wrong, that's not ideal. So, like, the last time I got really blown up was in bean, when the North Koreans or someone else figured out that the governance was flash loanable and then flash loaned it in quite stupendous fashion.
01:02:55.940 - 01:03:25.030, Speaker B: And that was quite annoying. It wasn't something I'd really sort of like clocked or what had even thought were possible, nor did anyone else, because the first rule of the governance contract should obviously be, you don't make it flash loadable. And so no one had really bothered to check. And I think they might have even edited it after the audit they had or something. But water under the bridge now. So sometimes it doesn't work. You've got to be very careful with gut feel because you can definitely sort of land yourself in the trap where you assume that historically I've been correct.
01:03:25.030 - 01:03:48.400, Speaker B: So I'll be correct again. And it's the turkey waiting for Christmas analogy at that point. But equally, it's not necessarily worth ignoring. Yeah, I mean, it's got feel. There's no real scientific way of laying it out. It's just sometimes things feel right, sometimes they don't have. Yeah.
01:03:48.400 - 01:04:49.400, Speaker B: Another way to put it right, like if you ignore everything that your gut says don't go with, and then the things your gut says do go with you, then sit down and like, work through properly, that's quite a good way of doing it. That's kind of how I do it, right? So there are a lot of things that I do end up dismissing out of hand that do end up working, which, okay, fine, but equally the loss to me, there isn't super high. And then there are some cases where I'm like, I think this will work. And then I go through it and I find something that makes it break, and then I'm like, okay, well, I don't touch it. But equally, if that's like, the approach you take very few times when you actually sort of become a full cropper and get screwed over, occasionally I will just sort of degenerately ape something in a sort of 2021 manner, but less often than most. Like, I'm still one of the only people I know that actually checks every single time I send a transaction that the address that I'm sending to is the correct one. Most people just don't do that, and they probably should because it would save a lot of the sort of phishing attacks and whatnot that people fall for.
01:04:49.940 - 01:05:10.960, Speaker A: But yeah, yeah, I think what you mentioned earlier is very important. If you miss out on something, right? Like you look at something, you just don't invest in it, or you don't buy it and it goes up, well, it's okay, you know, you just missed out. But if you buy something that ended nukes or you get rugged, then it's really, really bad. So it's really important.
01:05:12.580 - 01:05:42.176, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you want to be all in or not? And the question is always basically just, you know, is it worse for you if you aren't in and everything goes up or is it worse if you are and then it goes down. And weirdly, for a lot of people, it's definitely the sort of less expected one. It's that you aren't allocated and it goes up, it's just worse for some reason. And it's the same with like, shitcoins. You don't have to buy every shit coin you see, right. There are people that just do, they just buy everything.
01:05:42.176 - 01:06:26.150, Speaker B: And it's the same with everything. Deep whatever, you don't necessarily have to deposit it is probably worth being a little bit more judicious when it comes to selecting where you allocate not just your capital but also your time. Because there are a lot of people that will have sat there for the last four years shitcoining or whatever reality if they sat down four years ago. I'm going to learn rudimentary python or something over those four years, you end up quite a lot further. You just be a little bit more judicious with your time spent would be how I put it. And that was something that I sort of made a conscious decision to do quite early. I was going to learn x, I was going to learn y, I was going to learn z.
01:06:26.150 - 01:07:09.614, Speaker B: And then from there, the platform that you build, it's easier because one of the problems that people run into, and you see this a lot, is that the strategies that you're employing, when you have sort of six figures or five figures or seven figures or whatever, they change. They're very different as you scale up. And the things that work at smaller caps, they just don't work as you get bigger. And if all of your edge or whatever you've been doing has been very. Or it's required that that specific sort of bound of like capital sizing is where it works. When you move up to the next level and you keep trying to do the same thing, it doesn't work anymore. And either you get blown up or whatever, and you have to be very aware that, you know, the game does change.
01:07:09.614 - 01:07:21.930, Speaker B: And if you aren't building skills that sort of work through all the tiers of the game, it's going to be much harder to move up and stay up as well. A lot of people round trip, and that's possibly why.
01:07:23.470 - 01:08:24.008, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's really important. We just said there, there's a lot of people that get into crypto because of meme coins or shitcoining and the idea of four fixed to seven figs. But that only works if you're starting out with a small capital base, because crypto as an asset class is very illiquid. And if your identity or if the only skills that you have is flipping meme coins, then at some point it doesn't make sense to ape shitcoins just because if you get something wrong and you're holding this big bag of shitcoin, you just can't get out and trying to evolve, you know? Yeah, I think as a crypto trader investor, you kind of have to evolve your mindset as the market evolves and as the liquidity profile changes as well. Do you have any trading rules that you live by? Like, don't do this? What kind of trading rules do you have, if you have any?
01:08:24.184 - 01:08:54.386, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, again, I don't sort of like how I. It's kind of when I started doing this properly, I'm someone that really hates risk in a weird way. Like, I can't gamble. It just makes me feel ill. I really don't like it. So all of my trading historically has been, how do I find out how to minimize risk as far as I possibly can? So that's what naturally leads you to something like sniping. We're like, well, if the coin only exists in one place, it's in a pool, and I'm the first one to buy it.
01:08:54.386 - 01:09:35.907, Speaker B: My max loss is now, like, the spread of that is literally the maximum amount I can lose if this goes wrong, aside from being full rocket or whatever. So it just makes sense to buy that now. Of course, it's a really good idea to do that for other reasons, but equally, it's the least risky way of doing it. And that has always been what I've tended towards, finding ways of doing stuff that just carries the least amount of risk. I just don't really like losing very much, which is probably not net beneficial to me. There are times when it makes sense to fall down the risk curve and take the 55 45% plays rather than taking the 95 5% plays only. But equally, I'm kind of aware of that, and I know what works for me and what doesn't.
01:09:35.907 - 01:10:09.010, Speaker B: And a large part of that is being able to kind of, like, play yourself. Like, if you know that doing certain things, like, leaves you shaking and physically unable to sleep, maybe don't do them, even if, like, okay, it might work out, but if the cost to you is that high, then, you know, might not make as much sense. But other than that, I think everything we've kind of, like, already discussed is. Or you can sort of get a broad outline of kind of how I operate from that. It isn't.
01:10:10.710 - 01:10:12.278, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:10:12.334 - 01:10:21.420, Speaker B: It's not like I've sort of sat down at any one point and written these out as rules. It's just. It's what makes sense at the time. Right. You know, if I find something, okay, guts off. Ignore it. Find something.
01:10:21.420 - 01:10:50.276, Speaker B: Okay, this looks like it makes sense. Let's sit down and, like, run through the docks once or twice and have a look at, like, who's already deposited, how it's worked, what the flows have been so far. You know, dig through the data, all sorts of crap, and it looks good. Okay. Then we deposit, and then we, you know, if it's like a farm where you can kind of, like, math it out and sort of look at the, you know, the angles on the lines of the. With the price charts or whatever, then cool. Do that.
01:10:50.276 - 01:11:14.980, Speaker B: If it's not, then don't. The start of every day is a branching decision tree of possible routes. It can take, you just tend to get in a flow of running down the same ones over and over again just because they work and make sense. But they're not really hard and fast rules. They're just what makes sense to do at the time. And that can change depending on what youre, you're touching or playing with. They can be complete opposites day to day.
01:11:14.980 - 01:11:17.100, Speaker B: It really just depends on what it is.
01:11:18.040 - 01:11:59.430, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, I think self awareness is very important in crypto just because it's a very emotional industry. It's 24/7 social media. Everyone's celebrating their coins that's went up, and you kind of have to pick your own battles. And it seems like you personally don't like losing and you hate the idea of risk. So it seems like you move slower, you're more methodical in your approach, and whenever you do make a big bet or big bet, it's more longer time horizon where you have this thesis where the cost of being wrong is relatively low. Is that a good way to characterize your investing style?
01:11:59.470 - 01:12:14.790, Speaker B: Yeah, more or less. I would never use leverage. I don't really touch sexes because I'm wary of the blow up risk that they entail. Historically, leaving lots of money on taxes has never been a really good idea in this industry. So, yeah, that's pretty accurate.
01:12:16.730 - 01:12:36.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just curious, like, I mean, you know, you farm on chain, you farm stables, you're bullish tokenized treasuries and whatnot. Why not just withdraw everything and buy t bills or something? Or do you think, you know, it's like too far down the rabbit hole?
01:12:36.610 - 01:13:11.854, Speaker B: Well, yes, I'm also slightly interesting and then I'm slightly sort of a ghost person when it comes to, like, that's very residency and where I live and how I exist. And it's sort of a degree of personal detail that I probably can't get into on a public, yeah, of course. Podcast. But yeah, you know, I could. It's an option. But equally, you know, this is one of these sort of things that, like, everyone kind of implicitly understands. It's true, you know, money doesn't make you happy or whatever, and you cant actually, I think, really ever understand it until you get to the point where you have the money that they talk about.
01:13:11.854 - 01:14:22.834, Speaker B: And then youre sort of confronted with this problem where youre 25, whatever and youre done, you can retire, you can go and do whatever you want for the rest of your life and youre like, great, but what is that? And that is a really hard question to answer if you havent already got a plan in place before you get there. A lot of people that do it, they end up going to New York or LA or whatever and hanging out with c list celebrities and playing it that route, or they end up taking a load of drugs and lots of different options where that can go wrong and quite a lot where it can go right too. But it's not an easy question to answer. If you climb to the top of the mountain and okay, great, you spend a couple of minutes celebrating the top and then you either have to look around and be like, right, well, the hike down or you kind of think about, okay, well, what's the next mountain to climb? Right. You know, when do you stop? What's the, what's the kind of get out point? And I haven't really figured it out yet. You know, this is not a, you know, there's a, in my sort of personal day to day life, there's this. And not no one, I mean, a few people kind of know what I do, but no one really knows to sort of the whole extent of it.
01:14:22.834 - 01:14:52.350, Speaker B: But equally there's this sort of slight assumption that people make that you make a little bit of money, you, you must have sort of figured it all out, right? You've solved it. Life, and it's just not true at all. If anything, I know less than you do because maybe you have a job or whatever where there's a sort of clearly delineated set of goals and things that it makes sense to do for you. For me, it's not really true anymore. I don't have a tether to hold onto. It's just.
01:14:54.100 - 01:15:10.900, Speaker A: Sorry. But I guess the way you approach life, I guess, is similar to how you approach markets. Just do what makes sense in the moment. Don't be stupid. Right. But just, just go with the flow. You've accumulated all this knowledge throughout the years and you know, you like, just do what makes sense, I guess.
01:15:10.900 - 01:15:19.636, Speaker A: Like do you have any bigger ambitions when it comes to life? You've accumulated wealth, you're traveling, you're hiking, you're doing all this stuff like what's the end game for?
01:15:19.668 - 01:15:57.016, Speaker B: Blurred it's funny because I guess the impression I've given here is that I am quite risk averse. And if you were able to see a sort of travel itinerary with mine of the last couple of years, you sort of u turn on that. Yeah, I don't know. You know, it is very much a case of like, I have sort of tried to play my life in such a way that I leave as many doors open for as long as possible. And, you know, I still think that there are quite a lot of doors that are open, and it's one of the reasons that I've stayed anonymous for as long as I have. Because as soon as you become unanonymous and this is what you've been doing, a lot of doors instantly close to you. You might not want to believe it's true, but it.
01:15:57.016 - 01:16:20.250, Speaker B: But it certainly is. I don't know, I'm still figuring it out. I have a feeling that part of becoming a mature adult is realizing that you probably never will, to an extent. And yeah, I. I'm still on a voyage of discovery in a very cringe way.
01:16:21.790 - 01:16:53.870, Speaker A: I think we're all in a voyage of discovery in crypto, because things that have been around that were around a year ago, two years ago, is now gone. Poof. We just have to adapt to the markets. Where do you think Defi goes from here? We already talked about stable coins and whatnot, but how do you think the market has changed over the past couple of years? And what are your views on ether and other altcoins in general? Or do you just focus on your worldview?
01:16:54.410 - 01:17:22.360, Speaker B: I don't really have sex access at all. So that precluded or I wasn't really able to buy things like Sol or Luna or whatever, or get off the EVM early. Not that I tried very hard either, but it just wasn't really an avenue that was easy for me to access or was open to me. So I never really explored outside of that. Equally insofar as edge exists and I have it, I'm definitely sort of an EVM. Maxi. And the few times I have tried to write a boss on Sol or whatever, I have.
01:17:22.360 - 01:17:55.582, Speaker B: Well, not necessarily given up, but it's been a week of hard work and labor, and I end up with something that isn't necessarily close to what I had envisaged, when the sort of equivalent thing, if I was writing it in a medium I understood would have taken about a 20 minutes. And that's not ideal. I should definitely be branching out more than I do. But equally, I found a sort of system that works, so I've kind of been a bit lazy and stuck to it. Yeah. And sort of two years ago, the game was very frothy. No one really understood what the limits were or where it was going to go or how it all collapsed as soon as the.
01:17:55.582 - 01:18:55.120, Speaker B: And you sort of see this with cycles of Ohm and then all the ohm clones or, or whatever, as soon as everyone has understood how it plays out, once the next iterative cycle is much, much faster, because everyone knows what the equilibrium point is that we're all heading to. In all cases in Defi, pretty much where you're inventing value from scratch, the end point is zero. It can be a very long running one curve, maybe with its super slow emissions process, or it can be very fast. But the natural endpoint is the same. One of the reasons that, and I don't think I explained it very well necessarily, it got a bit muddled. But the reasons that sort of the RWA, if that's what we're going to call it, I guess, then fine. But the RWA thesis makes sense is that finally, for the first time, we're pulling in real outside yield, and in much the same way that we need this to work up to the point where it collapsing isn't just a load of people going to get jobs.
01:18:55.120 - 01:19:22.810, Speaker B: The only way it works is if the people with the guns and the people that actually decide how the world works are on your side, and they won't necessarily explicitly ever be on your side, but if you've sort of wrapped a load of us debt or whatever onto your system, and it suddenly becomes in their best interests to ensure that that stays sound and that doesn't sort of experience massive outflows, then you've also Wondez, right?
01:19:23.230 - 01:19:24.010, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:19:24.350 - 01:19:40.530, Speaker B: So that's kind of the goal. And I think for the first time in a long time, particularly over maybe the last six months or so, I've been able to envisage like a win condition, wherein that is what happens. And that hasn't really been possible before, you know? So if you'd asked me that question six months ago, I'd have been a lot more bearish than I am today.
01:19:42.150 - 01:20:29.280, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's really cool because I feel like my book is for tokenized treasuries, and I've been calling them yield bearing dollars, because I think rwas trigger people, because it implies that bitcoin is not real and whatnot. Yeah, I mean, I've been a Defi content creator for like three years now, over three years. And I've been thinking long and hard about how Defi recovers from here. And I don't know, outside of RWAs or yield wearing dollars, I don't see how DeFi becomes anti fragile because the system now is very fragile. The fed raises rates, it's capital leaves. And the response function for Defi should be to just bridge the risk free rate on chain. I feel like that's kind of how I think about it.
01:20:32.140 - 01:21:03.220, Speaker B: Imagine you build a water park. I don't know why I've picked a water park, but I have. You build a really, really good water park, and you've got loads of guests, whatever, it's going super great and making loads of money, and then for whatever reason, everyone leaves. I don't know, maybe the town you're in gets abandoned because of some weird whatever. But the point is, you now have a water park that nobody comes to, and you're able to wander around the sort of bones of this sort of great thing you built, and there's just no one there and nothing happening. It would be very easy to sort of conclude that the reason for that is that the water park was bad. If you didn't have any, like, outside knowledge of anything else that was going on.
01:21:03.220 - 01:21:20.384, Speaker B: And it's not necessarily true. Right. You might still have built a really good water park that was, you know, the perfect water park you could have built. But just extenuous circumstances meant that it was nothing being used anymore. And that's kind of how, if you defi, in a way, right. I think that the model we built is actually pretty decent. Right.
01:21:20.384 - 01:21:57.510, Speaker B: The primitives we have, the way they all fit together. The interoperability is good, but for reasons not entirely outside of our control, but because you can't run a system on an ever decreasing pool of liquidity forever, it eventually collapses. But collapses isn't really the right word. I think hibernates is a better one. And if you're able to sort of build a medium where, okay, we figure out another way of getting liquidity into the system and liquidity to start using the water park. Again, this analogy, then I think it just continues to work. It can come back.
01:21:57.510 - 01:22:22.670, Speaker B: Its death was not really a death at all. It was just the underlying value that sort of sat beneath. It just wasn't very good. USDC, that doesn't bear any yield when t bills are paying out, 5% is just a bad asset to hold. It's a really bad asset to hold. And the kind of people that are the ones that would use DeFi are not going to ignore that. They're going to go and hunt the yield elsewhere.
01:22:22.670 - 01:23:05.186, Speaker B: They'll just leave. But if you can get it to a point where the net neutral asset can exist on defi comfortably, all of the dollars become yield bearing or whatever, it should work. I don't really see any reason why it wouldn't work. It is definitely a net efficiency upgrade on what has existed before. You can probably tell I'm british. One of the most weird, interesting things to me when I first came to the US as a half adult was just how annoying to use your banking sector was. In the UK, we've had basically free interbank transfers since as long as I can remember, which might be showing my age a little bit, but that's always been something that has existed.
01:23:05.186 - 01:23:59.424, Speaker B: And I came to the US, I was trying to send someone some money and it was like a seven day process with a wire and a $12 fee. I was like, that is insane. It just doesn't make any sense at all. I'm sure it's improved since then. You've got venmo and cash app or whatever, but the primitives we have and what we've built, the lending markets that are reasonably anti fragile now, I'd argue the ones that have existed for quite a long time, and of course, risk parameters and all that are a very important part of that process and can't be ignored, but when they're set correctly, they kind of work. Amms are cool, perps are very cool. None of that has existed really before in the traditional sense, and that is useful, and it's not useful unless the stuff that you're using it with makes sense to own, which it hasn't for a long time.
01:23:59.424 - 01:24:45.776, Speaker B: You know, we live in a. In a. In a system where the ebbs and flows are quite severe, and when it ebbs hard, it really does ebb and everyone leaves and, you know, it shuts down for a while and then when it comes back, it gets really frothy very quickly and it's the new, you know, like it's changing the world, a new paradigm, etc, etc, etc. And that also isn't true, but it's because the people that are playing it are the ones at the far end of the early adoption curve and they will just vanish when it doesn't make sense to be there anymore. None of the capital is sticky in a funny way. One of the most important metrics for a protocol is how much dead liquidity you have. For instance, maker has the 700 mil from Richard Heart, which super useful.
01:24:45.776 - 01:25:17.030, Speaker B: A lot of chains just have money on them that are basically dead. We don't have that yet, and we never really have, only to a sort of super small scale. There's nothing that's like sort of super Lindy in our system yet. And that'll just change with age. It will come, it's just going to take a while. And for years I've been, you know, people sort of go, well, you know, how long? And I'm like, probably 20 years. You know, I really think that none of this truly, truly takes over until the people that are kind of like our age are the ones in power, in government, who can decide, you know, what I'm.
01:25:17.030 - 01:26:07.566, Speaker B: This is how we're going to do it now. Until you really get to that point, it's very hard to do. So it is a really long term thesis, and, yeah, there'll be a lot of froth in the sort of medium term where you'll be able to do very well. But if I imagine assuming that AI hasn't killed us all or whatever, how the world looks in 2025 years, I think a lot of it does run on the systems that we've sort of slowly built out today, to some extent. I don't know if the coin tickers will be the same or the colors will be the same or whatever, but certainly the systems, I think, will look similar. So, yeah, that's my kind of, like, grand long term crypto thesis, and largely why I haven't left, because I still think it makes sense, or at least there's nothing else in the world I've really looked at and gone, this makes more sense to spend my time on. So.
01:26:07.566 - 01:26:08.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:26:15.280 - 01:26:39.750, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. So, I mean, you've been very generous with your time, so just let me know if you need to leave soon. But I have a few more questions, if you don't mind. You've been in this space very long time. What do you think are the biggest misconceptions about the crypto market? And. Yeah, just general advice for newer participants that's trying to get to where you're at now.
01:26:46.490 - 01:27:11.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a weird one, this. There's this thing I call the. It's probably been written about somewhere else. I just haven't read about it. But I call it the sort of the Leidenfrost effect or the crypto ladenfrost effect, and the Leidenfrost effect is that sort of weird one in physics where if you coat your. You can basically touch lava or, like, molten iron or something very quickly because a layer of steam forms on your hand such that you never actually touched it. There's a tiny gap between your skin and the hot stuff.
01:27:11.430 - 01:28:10.630, Speaker B: And the same is true of crypto, in that there have been many cases over the last few years where I'll read an article on some actually legitimate news site, the BBC or whatever, about some massive crypto Ponzi collapsing one coin or a bunch of chinese ones. Omnichain or something. 600 million stolen. I'm like, how have I never ever heard of this at all? And I do this 12 hours a day. And it's important to note that there is a lot of what people think crypto is, that it really isn't. If you're a layperson, over the last couple of years, your exposure to crypto has probably been things like Cardano and XRP and all the stuff you get sent on Facebook ads or whatever. Because for those people, it makes sense to not actually interact with the people that use it a lot or use the system a lot, because if they do, they get shown out to be frauds quite quickly.
01:28:10.630 - 01:29:02.642, Speaker B: So I'm sure that this will probably ring true, that you'll have a friend or the people listening to this will have a friend or someone that you know that isn't really in crypto, but equally has this sort of weird attachment to some sort of very random asset that you wouldn't even necessarily really consider crypto. XRP is a common one. Cardano is another sort of common one. But there's a lot of them and they can be sort of very strange. And yeah, it's because there is sort of a very sort of weird tiered system where there are the people that kind of use it day in, day out that are actually sort of doing the stuff that wouldn't, say necessarily drives it forward, but is possibly interesting. And then there's the side of it where it is just kind of like a flat scam and they are selling vaporware and clouds and rainbows and unicorns or whatever and there's no real value there. So if you're very new, that is sort of a misconception.
01:29:02.642 - 01:29:41.180, Speaker B: And sort of in the broader market generally, is a misconception that definitely exists and it's quite hard to get away from because for them, the way that they make money is by selling it to as many new eyes as possible. For us, it's not really true. I don't want to go out and market kanto or maker to some village in rural Thailand, but they will. So it's like a sort of percentage game play. A lot of people's understanding of what crypto is and how the market works is not really very accurate. It is a function of what people want them to see because they'll make money off it. And that is very annoying as well because it kind of just sort of tars the entire industry with this brush.
01:29:41.180 - 01:30:31.658, Speaker B: And, yeah, okay. Most of what crypto is, is probably pretty scammy. So maybe talking 90% plus, it's only when you sort of get to the sort of the weirder math end of the spectrum, either at the consensus level layer or at the sort of contract writing layer, that it truly gets interesting. But that's just something to watch out for. If you've found a coin or whatever, you've been sitting on it for a long time and it doesn't really seem to interact with anything else, or the bubble of people that are interested in it don't seem to be part of the broader space. In general, that's probably a red flag. I've explained that very badly, but I think you can probably kind of see slightly what I mean, or at least you might have run across someone that does really think about Ripple as the sort of the second coming and why that doesn't necessarily make sense.
01:30:31.834 - 01:31:26.660, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I used to be a professional poker player and I had this poker community that was also in the crypto, and there was this one guy that was so adamant that XRP wasn't hit $1,000 and I just could not shake this guy on his belief. And I think there's always this mismatch, and this is true on crypto YouTube and crypto Twitter, where sometimes I look at things like XRP Cardano. I'm like, who the hell is buying these coins? And then you go to YouTube and you look up crypto and the first ten videos that show up is only XRP and Cardano. There's this mismatch between our reality versus how people perceive crypto. And I think crypto has a branding problem. It is kind of scammy. All the biggest headlines revolve around scams, and I think it's going to take time for people to shift, I guess, how they view crypto.
01:31:26.660 - 01:31:37.096, Speaker A: What do you think the next bull market looks like? Is it going to look the same as a couple of years ago? Or do you think has to be led by consumer apps, gaming, things like that?
01:31:37.208 - 01:32:41.346, Speaker B: What do you think gets a follow on from that? I think that what the bull market actually looks like, particularly outside, will be the exact same as it has before on every time, which is that it ends up looking like a lot of young people with a lot of money doing very stupid things. Because no matter what starts it off, the end will always be the same, even if you have some kind of legitimate. And the SEC gets a really bad rap from those of us in crypto because they just sort of seem to exist to just piss us off in a way, but equally they serve quite an important role. And if you sort of rewind back to the 1920s and the start really of the sort of broad mass market, stock market type stuff, it really doesnt make sense as a society to have it be possible to basically just steal the life savings of a load of people because they didnt really know any better. And you were a really good salesman, which is what happened a lot. And BSEC was founded to stop that, to shut down bucket shops and stop people selling stuff that they really shouldnt have been selling because it was fraudental. And that's their role, right.
01:32:41.346 - 01:33:51.120, Speaker B: It's to stop fraud basically. And if you're sitting sort of on the crypto side where you're specifically doing something that isn't fraud, it is really annoying to get caught up in the net of all the other stuff that is fraudulent because you're like, well, I'm not, but it's true. But so much of it is that it probably just makes more sense to shut the whole thing down than it does to try and actually go through and figure out who's right and who isn't, which is annoying, but you can kind of see where they're coming from. The state ultimately has to look after those people if they do get completely blown up, and that isn't great. So yeah, when the ball comes back, that'll happen again, right? You'll have people selling, they'll take whatever the good idea was and they'll juice it a bit with a token and slightly higher rates and they'll run it back. Time is a flat circle, as they say. But if you sort of rewind a little bit from that point and go, okay, well, what does the start of it look like? What are the things that they end up cloning that make it work? I do really, really like the.
01:33:51.120 - 01:34:29.868, Speaker B: I don't really want to call it the canto model because it's not a model that is specific to canto, but it is one that. Canto, I guess, is slightly pioneering at this point, but it's this way that you can kind of bridge ownership of RWA or like offhand the yield from. We really need a better name than rwas, but rwas to people that can't traditionally own them. So, you know, one of your questions was like, why don't you just withdraw it all in owned t bills? Because I can't. I don't have a US denominated bank account. I can't get a US denominated bank account. There is no actual way for me to legally go and buy t bills without a whole host of issues that I don't necessarily want to have to deal with.
01:34:29.868 - 01:35:03.022, Speaker B: With. And that's true for a lot of people, right? But let's imagine you build a sort of a lending market where you can offer, I don't know, 20 x leverage on it. Wouldn't t bill fine. But some other sort of debt instrument, I don't know, like a CDO, a mortgage bond or some sort of corporate debt bond or anything at all. It really doesn't matter. Anything that pays out a yield in a sort of consistent, stable way, right? And you offer 20 x leverage on it, you tokenize it, fine. You buy a load of it, you put it in this lending market, you borrow right up to your sort of limit, your hilt, and you now have $0.95
01:35:03.022 - 01:35:29.970, Speaker B: on the dollar against whatever you've done. And then you go and buy more of it. You lever it all the way up to your sort of 20 x lever. And then on the sort of the supply side, the supply side and the borrow costs, they ramp up to a sort of weird midpoint, which is just under what the yield is, what this bond is paying out in yield. So let's say it's 8%, right? The borrow rate will go up to 7.9% and the supply rate will sit around 7.87.9% as well.
01:35:29.970 - 01:36:23.506, Speaker B: What's effectively happened there is that the people that have supplied into this lending market, and by supplying, they've just given them dollars, basically are earning the yield on whatever that bond is slightly under. They're getting middleman, essentially by the person that's looping it up, but they're getting that yield. And you're able to do that without requiring the lender there to Kyc or go through all the hoops that you would traditionally have to. What this allows for is it allows for basically every single type of debt instrument you can think of to be bought by basically anyone on the planet. And that is cool, that is novel, that hasn't been done before. And based on what I understand of the world, I think there is really decent demand for something like that. So that's one way I can see it happening, or at least at the moment, it's the only good way.
01:36:23.506 - 01:36:58.900, Speaker B: I've sort of seen of a potential explosion in TVL or assets on chain or whatever you want to call it. Because really your only limiter is how much leverage people want to offer you. And of course, when you sort of go, okay, you sit back, fine, let's just do it through protocols and juice a little bit on top. Then you have a system that is actually quite compelling in a way that it just historically hasn't been. You're doing defi all over again, but you're doing it with these assets that it actually makes sense to hold, rather than assets that don't necessarily make all that much sense to hold.
01:36:59.520 - 01:37:52.650, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, I'm just sharing this on the screen, but for like, the audience just explaining what he just talked about is anyone like, if you go through the KYC process, you can mint this USYC, which is a t bill token. We're not really sure what the actual yield is, but let's just assume it's 5%. And people like blur. He's willing to borrow stablecoins up to a borrow rate as long as it's paying or as long as the interest rate is below 5% and do like to this carry trade and permissionlessly. Anyone in the world, if they have a metamask or EVm wallet, can lend out these stable coins to people like blur. In that way, you're tokenizing the treasury and you can kind of own this digital asset, or, sorry, you can own this, that instrument without actually owning it. And that's kind of what he's talking about.
01:37:52.650 - 01:38:14.180, Speaker A: I mean, I also own kanto, and I'm also bullish to model, but what needs to happen for your kanto thesis to be invalidated? Because every trade has some invalidation. You have a thesis. If it plays out, great. If it doesn't, then you have to cut it at some point. What is that moment for you?
01:38:14.310 - 01:39:15.956, Speaker B: The cut point? Yeah. So, I mean, obviously you have the whole like, regulatory risk side of things which exists, and there's this sort of weird, like, race condition here where, you know, I really think in the long run, it kind of makes sense to allow this to happen if you're a government, just because, you know, it allows you to much more easily win the like, knife fight for credit, which is sort of, I think, coming, but equally, until that is realized at the government level, which will be a long time after it's been realized by everyone else, I'd argue they could try and shut it down. You could just try and be like, well, you're not allowed to own assets. If you then go and tokenize them or whatever, there's lots of different avenues of doing it that would invalidate it. If they very seriously shut it down from an on chain. If it doesn't work. Well, I mean, much harder to sort of say if you're offering like a 20% rate or whatever, and no one wants it for whatever reason, then that might invalidate it.
01:39:15.956 - 01:39:57.056, Speaker B: But equally like, if one thing has always been true in crypto, it's that people don't really assess risk properly, and generally bigger number means more people deposit. That's just always been true. Not ideal. It's caused a lot of problems historically, and it will probably continue to cause problems going forward, but it has been true. But if there isn't much demand, for whatever reason, for these systems when they're paying out well above market market rates, as they will hopefully be doing in the relatively short term future, then that probably invalidates it, I think. But is there a hard cutoff point where that's true? Not really. I think it'll be very much a vibes gut thing over a solid.
01:39:57.056 - 01:40:52.180, Speaker B: Here are the metrics you want to lay out. You could probably write down some actual hard number breakpoints if you wanted to. I'm not necessarily sure it makes that much sense to do that, or at least to stick to them if they do get hit, just because it really does depend. All of this is so novel and new and nascent that it's really hard to predict how it'll pan out anyway. And one of the big things I'm worried about is this, what I call the lunar problem, which is that this model is a lot less clear than fully on chain things. There is a level of opacity here that, okay, fine, technically you're protected by US laws and actual income paper regulations, but equally, you can't see that the average deFi participant, it is definitely just not as clean as something where the rules are set. You can go and literally read them in a contract.
01:40:52.180 - 01:42:23.508, Speaker B: What I assume will eventually happen if the model does work, or at least like halfway into the model working, is that you will get people that come along that basically try and copy the model, but juice it slightly with something that isn't fully kosher because it makes the number higher and number higher means more people arrive and use the thing, and then eventually it all collapses and a lot of people end up crying. And if that happens in a very bad way, well, it could just, you know, it can pull down the whole system with it, FTX, mount Gox, whatever sort of systemically problematic things that are able to appear and grow. And Luna is kind of like a weird one in that a lot of people that kind of understood how this system worked knew it wasn't going to work, and that was well understood years before it collapsed. But something like this because of the slightly sort of hidden and opaque nature of it. It'll be much harder to spot, I think, but kind of at this point, like, if you're like, it doesn't really invalidate the canto thesis because it kind of implies Kanto has already worked in that way, but it's still something I'm watching out for, because that will be damaging when it happens. But equally, if you offer people 20% on dollars, why is that not going to work? And that's the question I've been asking myself for the last couple of months as I've been sort of slowly accruing. In what sort of timeline does that not end up working? And I'm struggling to answer.
01:42:23.508 - 01:42:53.640, Speaker B: It's possible, I guess it's possible that we can't figure out the right interest rate mechanisms or whatever, but back to the kind of like how we pan out trades, you want the trades that the unlikely things have to happen for it to not work out, versus you need a load of the nodes hit in sequence. This is definitely one of those types of traits where the invalidation is quite unlikely, or at least it seems like the validation is likely.
01:42:55.460 - 01:43:37.620, Speaker A: Yeah, in a way. The way I've been framing it is all these yield bearing dollar projects, they're effectively vampire attacking USDC, which I think is an interesting way to view. You called it regulatory arbitrage because USDC can never offer a staking yield on chain. They offered on Coinbase, but they can't offer it on chain. I can definitely see circle starting to halt redemptions or charge fees for redemptions. If this trade gets too profitable, that could also be a risk. Maybe USDC just says screw you, but maybe another competitor takes away.
01:43:40.000 - 01:44:16.672, Speaker B: It gets causally dense at a certain point where there are a lot of different possible angles that can play out. Yeah, USDC adding a redemption cost to it probably does change the game ever so slightly. I'm not sure it changes it necessarily that much. It depends on what sort of fee they charge. If it's ten basis points or a basis point or whatever, well, fine. I don't think it's as bad as you make it out to be that it could be made out to be equally, if the system works, it should end up net reversing the stablecoin decline. And I think actually maybe this month, and I'm taking secondhand information here, so don't quote me on it.
01:44:16.672 - 01:44:49.084, Speaker B: I haven't actually looked at numbers myself, but stablecoin flows might have reversed finally. Yeah, if it works and you can pay 20% or whatever, then realistically, it's not just a vampire attack on USDC, it's just a vampire attack on USD in banks, if that makes sense. So it should just balloon stable. So you're like, okay, how does it pan out to the next bull run like this, right. We reverse the stablecoin flows and then it sort of slowly plays out like that. Yeah. But I do think it's at least a sort of a one to two year time span before things get.
01:44:49.084 - 01:44:52.120, Speaker B: Get frothy again, regardless of what happens. You know what I mean?
01:44:52.900 - 01:44:56.820, Speaker A: Yeah. And you mean that for, like, the broader crypto markets, right.
01:44:56.940 - 01:44:59.004, Speaker B: Just it's funny.
01:44:59.052 - 01:45:01.480, Speaker A: Some time to recover where it's stuck more.
01:45:03.540 - 01:45:56.664, Speaker B: The most update in a while, but slightly, yeah. I mean, a lot of what I think sort of trading at the moment is the people that just haven't left the system yet that have sat in dollars or whatever and are playing with leverage. Who knew? Is buying crypto at the moment? I mean, maybe you have people that have sort of converted to the bitcoin thesis on the back of all the war that's going on or whatever, but it doesn't feel like that's probably that big a percent of what's happening at the moment. I think we sort of, you know, for it to properly go sort of multiples bull again, like it has in 2021 or 2017 or whatever, some catalyst has to appear, and I don't think we've really seen one yet that makes sense for that to play out. You know, it's worth remembering as well that the dollar has inflated a lot since 2020. Right. So, you know, f at two k is not necessarily that much better than f back then at 1.5
01:45:56.664 - 01:46:26.276, Speaker B: or whatever. I. And it's worth being sort of cognizant of the fact that you are not necessarily just trading against the dollar, you're trading against the purchasing power of the dollar, which is not something people tend to graph that often, but it's quite important. It's funny, if you want to go graph bitcoin against the argentine peso or the turkish lira or whatever, one of the other characters. Yeah. Basically all time highs every day, perpetually. But as rates go up or whatever, the us dollar becomes more like that than it was before.
01:46:26.276 - 01:46:27.980, Speaker B: It's important to remember that.
01:46:28.960 - 01:46:57.120, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I also don't see a crazy bull market. I mean, you know, we could be in a bull market, but it's not going to be, you know, euphoric conditions. Let me just. Let me just show you this these are my channel analytics. This might be interesting to you, but, like, these are my subscriber counts, and every time I upload a video, I lose subscribers. And recently, look, it's kind of picking up bullish.
01:46:57.580 - 01:46:59.756, Speaker B: Bullish? Bullish. 1% change. Yeah.
01:46:59.828 - 01:47:00.148, Speaker A: Yes.
01:47:00.204 - 01:47:00.764, Speaker B: Funny.
01:47:00.892 - 01:47:16.040, Speaker A: I gained seven subscribers yesterday. That's sick. So, you know, I do think, you know, I mean, crypto is very reflexive, right? Just as price goes higher, more people, there's more demand. It's like a veblen. They call it a veblen. Good, I believe.
01:47:16.340 - 01:47:17.364, Speaker B: Veblen.
01:47:17.532 - 01:47:44.460, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're near a two hour mark. I do want to keep talking more, but I'm sure we can do a part two if the people demand it at some time in the future. Last question I have for you, or actually, yeah, two more questions. But one of the last question is you mentioned you might have one of the most expensive failed transactions in crypto related to your punk.
01:47:44.460 - 01:47:46.160, Speaker A: I mean, can you go over that again?
01:47:47.420 - 01:47:49.720, Speaker B: It was empty set dollar ESD.
01:47:50.160 - 01:47:50.864, Speaker A: Okay.
01:47:50.992 - 01:48:39.510, Speaker B: And if you go find it. Actually, there's a bug on etherscan that I've only ever seen on this transaction because it was so unlucky. But essentially the way that that worked was there was a coupon system when the coin went under peg, and you kind of. I'm not going to be able to explain the entirety of how ESD works because it's quite complicated, but basically there was like a queue, if you like, of like a free for all queue of coupons that you had to try and get redeemed to get out. And if it were happening nowadays, the whole thing would just be Mev to perfection. But back then, Mev wasn't really a thing. So it was very much a case of you just try and gas and race to try and get these things out, redeem them, and then you get a fungible token back that you can go and sell for dollars rather than holding your coupon.
01:48:39.510 - 01:49:38.388, Speaker B: And what would happen? Someone built a contract called the clipper, which meant that if you weren't very good at that sort of gas race or war or whatever, you could offer your coupons up to someone else for some percentage fee or whatever, and they would redeem them for you, which was perfect. It made sense. Problem was, this contract was incredibly rudimentary and not super well designed, and there was no time lock on your setting the fee. So what you could do is you could set a 20% fee up front, wait until 20 seconds before the rollover when the coupons will be clippable and then just drop it to 0%, which was really annoying. If you were someone clipping coupons because you were paying up 100,000 to clip these, it was that valuable to pull it off. If you did it for somebody and then didn't get paid, it was very annoying. It meant that you had to basically pre deploy these contracts with sets in a queue of like the people you were going to clip coupons for.
01:49:38.388 - 01:50:37.170, Speaker B: Because if you try to do it all in the same block, you were paying 100,000 to add all that storage data versus the ten gui you'd be paying to do it an hour before. Whatever. What happened to me was that, right the last moment before the rollover, a load of people got savvy of this, like, oh, I can just change the fee to 0% and I'll still get clipped. They did that, and I built a sort of script out of that, would very quickly reorder the list, deploy a contract for me so that I could hit it correctly and not clip people for free. But what happened was that there were maybe eight in the queue, like originally when I sort of designed this, and all the people pulling out meant that sort of queue number ballooned to about 30 people. And that meant the gas price or the gas limit of that transaction went up massively. And in the end I won the race in this specific occasion at about 130,000, I think it was.
01:50:37.170 - 01:51:27.592, Speaker B: But I had set my gas limit about 0.1% too low. So the transaction actually failed in the gas token contract explosions, which, if you know what that is from years ago, used to be able to get 40% of the cost of your gas back by freeing up storage space. And there was a tokenization system that existed around this. But I was so close to the limit that the failure actually happened in that final few points of gas, such that ethoscan still shows the gas token contracts as destructing, even though they ultimately didn't, and they were refunded to me. So I won the race, did all of it, and then had to watch it all get undone, pay all the gas for it, and then watch someone else come in just behind me and win the thing it cost me about, I think it was 230 ether, I think, at the time.
01:51:27.656 - 01:51:28.380, Speaker A: Jeez.
01:51:28.720 - 01:51:55.660, Speaker B: And there have been bigger transactions that succeeded that paid more gas. But that was, I think, the biggest transaction that had failed. So I got literally no value out of it at all. And not only that, it was worse because had I like, won or at least put 20k more gas limit, I think it was worth like 200k or something. It was a lot. I was on a bus in Turkey on a ferry crossing the Dardanelles Strait south of Istanbul at the time. Hot spotting off my phone.
01:51:55.660 - 01:52:11.316, Speaker B: When I saw it, it happened. I was sort of looking at an SSH instance on my phone and I just turned it off and I didn't open my lap again for another day and a half after that. I knew instantly what I'd done and it was so annoying. But yeah, that's the story of that.
01:52:11.508 - 01:52:18.748, Speaker A: Wow. Well, at least. Yeah, you must have been tilted at the time, but it was pretty tilted.
01:52:18.924 - 01:52:19.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:52:19.300 - 01:52:20.360, Speaker A: At least you can say.
01:52:20.960 - 01:52:33.984, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. It's kind of like the way I sort of viewed at the time was like, okay, I have bought an incredibly expensive anecdote to get mileage out of it. I have to. How many times do I have to tell the story? But, yeah, it is what it is.
01:52:34.112 - 01:52:41.728, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like someone just buying some expensive Nft that is like down 90%, but at least, you know, it's tuition.
01:52:41.784 - 01:52:42.856, Speaker B: Fees as we call it.
01:52:42.928 - 01:53:08.880, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks for the story. Yeah. So almost 2 hours in, if anyone's listening to this still now, I mean, you know, they deserve some alpha, right? Do you have any, I mean, it doesn't have to be like alpha, but like, like, do you have any life alpha or like crypto alpha? Just general how to. How to make it. You know, my audience, you know, I mean, myself included, like, we're all trying to make it out.
01:53:08.920 - 01:53:39.250, Speaker B: How to make it somehow implies I already have. And as I sort of said earlier, you know, this is a. This is misdirection that people assume. You kind of. No, I have no idea at all. In many ways, I kind of look at the way my life has panned out now and I sort of, if I could rewind it and just live a slightly simpler one, would I take that option? And the answer is maybe. So maybe the sort of alpha is that making it isn't necessarily what you want to do, even if you think it is, which is terrible advice and not something you want to hear, but possibly true.
01:53:39.250 - 01:54:10.750, Speaker B: I sort of joke that there are very few 25 year olds that would. That would sort of look at my life and be like, I don't want to trade. But if they did, then ultimately trade, I think most of them would probably trade back within a week. It's not an easy lifestyle necessarily this. And I look a lot older than I do because, you know, if you sit with this kind of risk on attitude, most of the time, you know, every morning you wake up, it's one of those, like, okay, has something gone badly wrong in the night that I'm going to have to, like, mitigate for, you know, isn't necessarily super fun.
01:54:11.630 - 01:54:18.930, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like you manage life like, I mean, it's not really work, but, you know, it seems to manage, like, the work life balance pretty well.
01:54:19.510 - 01:54:37.484, Speaker B: It's very premodonary, and, you know, I'm not complaining in any way at all. You know, if you imagine it as sort of a Monte Carlo simulation or whatever. Right. Sort of. The path I've picked is definitely one of the snakes that's run close to the top of the line, I think. But, yeah, it's always fun reflecting.
01:54:37.662 - 01:54:58.900, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's important to reflect. It's a very. You have a very humble way of, you know, you seem very self aware, not cocky. You know, you say that there's elements of luck involved, but, I mean, everyone has luck, right? I mean, you kind of have to put your position. You kind of have to put yourself in a position to be lucky.
01:54:59.520 - 01:55:16.792, Speaker B: Sure. Like, you do have to spend the sort of, you know, 16 hours, seven days a week for two years. Like, that was a requirement, and I wouldn't have made it if I didn't do that. That, and it was very brutal. But equally, there wasn't any sort of massive degree of skill. I'm not a very good programmer. I'm not excellent at all of these skills.
01:55:16.792 - 01:55:57.576, Speaker B: I'm just good enough at all of them that the net works. My risk appetite, weirdly, is high enough, even though I sort of verify and dislike it. That plays to my favor because it means I spend a lot more time figuring out how to minimize it than most people do. Yeah, I don't really have any alpha. It's sort of one of the things I've never done. You get a family friend calling up saying, what coin should I buy? You never give an answer just because it never ends well. Equally, having talked about Kanto here, a lot of people that own Kanto off the back of me, selling it to them, who, at least in some part, view me as responsible for the direction the line goes.
01:55:57.576 - 01:56:40.430, Speaker B: And it's not something I really want to. To feel or be in a position to sort of hold up that weight of expectation, inevitable to an extent. And if you want to sort of move a little bit into the kind of, like, well, doing what you do, you sort of have to shoulder that risk and deal with it as it comes and be a little bit perhaps more sure of what you're selling than you would be if it were just you. If I get blown up tomorrow, I'm pretty confident I'd be able to, like, at least make most of it back or some of it back or survive. You know, if you blow up other people as a consequence of what you're selling them, it's a little bit less easy to deal with, perhaps. So I kind of really respect you for being able to do what you do in a way. I definitely couldn't do it.
01:56:41.410 - 01:56:47.074, Speaker A: No. Appreciate it. Yeah, there's. Yeah. Contents.
01:56:47.122 - 01:56:47.450, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:56:47.530 - 01:57:04.574, Speaker A: Content's very hard. Sometimes people love you. Sometimes people hate you. All I can do, I mean, the best thing I can do is just try to be authentic. You know? Like, even if I'm wrong, it's like, it's not that I'm, like, it's not that I have that bad intentions. Right.
01:57:04.662 - 01:57:07.854, Speaker B: I believe, trying to defraud. Yeah, exactly.
01:57:08.022 - 01:57:08.398, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:57:08.454 - 01:57:48.554, Speaker B: So I've always joked that, you know, like, a lot of what I do is possibly on the gray line of, like, what is acceptable and what is not, you know, but I've always claimed that everything I do, or at least everything I try to do, is cricket. Or. Or at the ultimate point, the moral arbiter of this space is ethiscan. And if doing something is going to make them put a red notice on your wallet, then probably don't do it. But, yeah. Slightly harder for the people that assume a position of trust, which is something I've never really had to do, and I'm thankful for that. It's not something that I think I'd enjoy, which ties into why I've never really bothered with social media or Twitter or anything like that.
01:57:48.554 - 01:57:54.322, Speaker B: That's just a whole element to this game that feels a little bit dangerous in a way, to me.
01:57:54.466 - 01:58:21.218, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't worry about, you know, because people following and stuff. I mean, this. This is gonna be like a two hour podcast episode, right. So, like, if anyone's clicking on this, they're gonna lean more towards sophisticated and, you know, more. Yeah. Like, you know, they're here to learn and I guess get part of your wisdom, you know, mister humble blur here. But anyways, let's wrap up 2 hours.
01:58:21.218 - 01:58:30.510, Speaker A: It's pretty good time, I think. Do you have any final words for the guests? Final words of wisdom? Anything you want to share with the audience? Life advice, whatever?
01:58:33.210 - 01:58:45.600, Speaker B: Not really bad answer right now, but, yeah, you know. No, I don't. There's nothing witty or I've blanked completely.
01:58:45.940 - 01:58:50.404, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, just maybe enjoy life, enjoy nature kind of thing.
01:58:50.572 - 01:58:50.972, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:58:51.036 - 01:58:56.000, Speaker A: Do you want to tell us about your, your trips? I guess to wrap up?
01:58:59.660 - 01:59:29.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you know, for a while I was. I was doing what is what is termed dark tourism, I guess, where you go to specifically dangerous places. Iraq, Ukraine after the invasion, Sri Lanka when the government was falling apart, that kind of thing. But recently I've been looking at sort of experiential stuff. So I snow kited across Greenland. I've just finished a ten day hike in Turkey, stuff like that, where it's very type two fun. And most of it is quite type two fun.
01:59:29.478 - 01:59:57.740, Speaker B: It's the sort of stuff that you do where it sucks at the time and then you finish it and you're like, wow, I'm very glad I did that. Or pulled it off, whatever. And the endorphin kick you get at the end is very enjoyable. More generally, I just move around a lot, I think. In 2022 I touched about 51 countries total over the course of the year, not including repeats, which is quite a lot. You know, I spend a lot of time in airports and on planes. I'm a pilot, which I quite enjoy doing by accident.
01:59:57.740 - 02:00:50.298, Speaker B: It was never an intention of mine, but I got locked out of the US because of my travel history. And in Covid, all of the embassies were shut, so the only way in was to get a student visa and I didn't really fancy going to college again. So I found out that under that umbrella of, well, visa types is the vocational training and in that you can become an electrician or a dance coach or a chef or a pilot. So I've got a pilot's license that way and fire decent amount now. Yeah, I don't know. I made this decision to try and run the gauntlet of human experience before I was 30 and I'm a decent way down the list by now, I think. Yeah, just because if you get to that point and you tend to acquire responsibility to some extent, be it a family or whatever.
02:00:50.298 - 02:01:45.160, Speaker B: And I mean, there's sort of this ludicrous position where I have more or less unlimited wealth and the kind of like, you can actually spend it sense if you're not buying capital assets and no responsibility at all, it's not tied to equity in a company I've started or anything else. And thus I'm free to do what I want. As I sort of said earlier, that when you are confronted with that problem, it's quite a difficult problem to answer because most people, they imagine that they want to do all these things and go all these play and reality. Most people don't, actually. And I sort of decided that I would. And Covid helped quite a lot with that because it kind of forced me out of my comfort zone and that I didn't really want to sit in a flat on my own for two years, even though I was sort of the person that would be most comfortable with that outside of COVID being a thing. And it just forced me out into the world and into the sort of more interesting places that couldn't afford to deal with COVID in the way the west did, really.
02:01:45.160 - 02:01:48.810, Speaker B: And I never really look back.
02:01:50.550 - 02:01:52.530, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it seems like you're living a life.
02:01:53.870 - 02:02:57.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm living a life. It's novel, certainly. And there's a. You know, it was about a guy who'd spent two years sort of basically hitchhiking and living rough around the US, and he was sort of talking about it in hindsight, and he was like, look, if you go and do something like this, you have to kind of be comfortable and okay with being the most interesting man in the room in a way. And that is very double edged sword in a way that you can't necessarily understand unless you kind of have experienced it. I very much sort of found that has become a thing recently, and I'm still very anonymous, but have become a little bit less so perhaps in the last year and try to sort of navigate who I want to be perceived as it's become, well, an interesting problem because there are sort of a couple of facets I could, like, prioritize, but I haven't really figured out which one makes the most sense for me. You know, none of that really is life advice.
02:02:57.790 - 02:03:38.686, Speaker B: It's much more me sort of agony aunting you and this becoming sort of therapy in a sort of very weird and abstract sense. But, yeah, yeah, you know, it's different for everyone. The problems that you face are most likely unique to you in some capacity. But I think one thing that I would definitely advise is that most people just don't sit and reflect anymore. Everyone has a phone, and if you sit down for five minutes or whatever, you take the phone out and you play a game of chess or you look at memes or whatever, but just sitting down and thinking sometimes is a very good use of time. And most people don't really bother anymore. And that's a shame, I think, but, yeah, yeah.
02:03:38.718 - 02:04:10.310, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you so much, blur. I think there's a lot of lessons to be had from this episode, and I hope the audience enjoyed it as well. Well, I mean, you're off the grid, so there's, like, no way for anyone to ask you questions. But maybe some, sometime next year we can do, like, a part two to see, you know, where you are and whether the art of it all panned out. Yes, if it all panned out, that'd be cool. All right, cool.
02:04:10.310 - 02:04:17.330, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Hope you guys enjoyed, and, yeah, have a good day, sir. Bye.
