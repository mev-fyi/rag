00:00:00.200 - 00:00:24.430, Speaker A: Alright, what is up, everyone? This is Taiki here. And today I wanted to, I guess, interview one of the other crypto youtubers that I deeply respect. His name is Noah Seidman. I think he has one of the most underrated YouTube channels in the space. He often talks about putting dollars to work and thinks about his portfolio management and market psychology. And I just wanted to have him on as my first guest for this podcast. So welcome, Noah.
00:00:24.430 - 00:00:29.170, Speaker A: And can you just tell us a little bit about yourself and how, when and how did you get into crypto?
00:00:29.520 - 00:00:51.620, Speaker B: Hi, everybody. It's a pleasure. It's a long story and trying to keep it simple. I have a background in electrical engineering. I've been an Android software dev for the last 1112 years, give or take. At this point. And obviously from a tech perspective, the concept of cryptocurrency as a software technology just made sense.
00:00:51.620 - 00:01:22.180, Speaker B: My interest in it were probably in 2015 ish. What was my first crypto? It wasn't bitcoin, it was Dash. Dash was my first crypto. I was mining it on genesis. Mining for it was $3 a pop at the time. And I remember that thing is really rallying to a thousand. So those are my initial days, and a lot has changed since then.
00:01:22.180 - 00:01:28.766, Speaker B: The story that I tell nowadays is much more interesting than where we came from.
00:01:28.918 - 00:01:41.370, Speaker A: I see. So you've been in the space for essentially six years now. You work mining dash. So how has your. I guess. How's your view on crypto change from 2015 to where you are now?
00:01:41.990 - 00:02:25.180, Speaker B: The biggest change is that. Maybe just an observation on my part, because the same way stocks are looked at as speculative assets. You buy something, you watch it go up in value. You sell something, you buy something else, it goes down in value. You cut your losers, you get your losers go, and you reallocate the value to the winners. That's such a horrible way to operate, meaning it requires a very extensive technical skill set. The biggest evolution that I've seen is that that is no longer the case for the crypto space, and that occurred last year in 2020.
00:02:25.180 - 00:02:58.476, Speaker B: My uncanny ability is to observe things from a macro perspective, a thousand foot view, and to see systemic change. And that is not just a change. That is a massive radical shift in what can be normal operating procedure for engaging with the crypto markets, which takes a massive departure for our mindsets and even how we look at capital. So it's just extraordinarily different, and that's just something I observe.
00:02:58.668 - 00:03:23.486, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Like when I first got into crypto, I was just like buying things on Coinbase and just like hoping things went up. But the deeper I get into decentralized finance and defi, and these create like, amazing decentralized applications, I was just like, yeah, I can actually put assets to work. I can't do this with stocks, but with bitcoin, eth, USDC, I can put them to work. And actually they have utility. Right. And I want to just transition over to.
00:03:23.486 - 00:03:55.060, Speaker A: I think what you're most known for, at least on your daily talks on YouTube, is like using dollars, like utilizing dollars and putting them to work and operating your portfolio as a business. Right. And most of my videos were, they were inspired by your videos and I tuned into your live streams every single day on the weekday, and I look forward to them every single morning. So my question to you is, on average, what percentage of your portfolio is in cash and what advantages in the past has having extra cash allowed you to do?
00:03:56.040 - 00:04:35.248, Speaker B: There's two different modes. There's, we just exited a mode, the mode of operation. While the market experienced, the rational exuberance is to have a quantity of principle in cash, which means you have your list of assets. Cash is just another asset. So when the market's hot, you're trimming principal and reallocating towards cash, which is an asset on your balance sheet, so to speak. And all those assets can be used to borrow working capital in the form of cash. And that working capital gets put on the balance sheet, just like a business.
00:04:35.248 - 00:05:16.510, Speaker B: So your cash on your books is the sum of your dollars principal that you have because you sold assets at the top or on the way up, plus the cash that you borrow as debt, it's just the way a business operates. So when the market's hot, you're trimming profits, accumulating cash on the balance sheet. That when the market's not hot, which is now, I argue, I don't have any principal cash on the balance sheet. I have my assets deployed. I have working capital, the denominated in cash, which is added to the balance sheet. So right now, no principle in cash. I have debt in the form of cash.
00:05:17.330 - 00:06:09.102, Speaker A: I see. And I feel like, like your like, mindset of, like, how do you like operating your, I guess, portfolio, like a balance sheet and a business is something that's really overlooked, at least by crypto influencers. I feel like before I made, started making videos, everyone on YouTube is like, like making these ridiculous faces and saying like, you know, bitcoin's going to half a million in like three months, so buy the dip, like all this b's right about, like, bullish propaganda. And I feel like, you know, just putting stable coins to work or, like, thinking of that mindset is severely undervalued. So I really appreciate how you think about crypto, and I do think that you're helping a bunch of people operate, you know, their business, let's say. So let's just move over to talking about Matic. So I think both you and I were very bullish, matic in particular, Aave.
00:06:09.102 - 00:06:15.890, Speaker A: So can you just quickly go over, like, your bullish case for Matic and the whole entire polygon ecosystem?
00:06:16.670 - 00:06:51.750, Speaker B: Well, there's three large scale narratives I see at play. You have Ethereum, which is a digital financial system that spans the globe. It's permissionless, which means you in any country could interact with it. For instance, finance smart chain is a digital financial system, but us residents are not allowed to interact with it, which is 300 plus million human beings on the planet. Quite a restrictive financial system. We have to see how the chinese digital financial system plays out. But that's the second narrative.
00:06:51.750 - 00:07:27.562, Speaker B: First one, Ethereum global financial system. The chinese digital financial system is basically the BSN. The BSN is basically the United States Department of blockchain Technology. In China, they are full on blockchain. It is open. You go on Twitter, you look up the BSN, you'll see everything that the chinese government is doing with regard to blockchain technology. And then you'll quickly see who's integrated with the BSN because they have a list of public blockchains and the three most prominent, I would argue, is Ethereum, Polkadot and Cosmos.
00:07:27.562 - 00:08:04.662, Speaker B: I believe NIo and EOS is probably on there, but they have no financial system activity. Neither does Polkadot nor cosmos, for that matter. But they are closer, in my opinion, because you can see the development of the projects and the Defi construction going on, so to speak. So very interesting. That's two large scale narratives that I see, and the third is India. So Matic was made by three indian entrepreneurs. Aside from how it started, right now it has reached critical mass.
00:08:04.662 - 00:08:55.680, Speaker B: What is a financial system required to have critical mass requires critical mass, liquidity, to the tune of 8910 billion dollars right now of capital available on Aave. That amount of liquidity says, hey, developers, you're going to make a fortune if you start building apps, because all that capital is going to get deployed to your defi application. The developers create their dapps, which says, hey, users, come use our dapps, and you guys make money as well. So once the users start to deploy capital and tap those many billions of dollars worth of liquidity, he ended up creating monetary velocity. And this is in terms of literally every financial system around the world spanning back however long you want to think about it. Legacy financial system. That's the way we.
00:08:55.680 - 00:09:15.920, Speaker B: What's the way? I look at the crypto space. So if you look at Fred M two velocity for the United States dollar, it's crashing. But if you look at it's pummeled. It looks like it's. Is it going to get up? It looks like a boxer in the 10th round. That's down for the count. So.
00:09:15.920 - 00:09:51.532, Speaker B: But the velocity in the defi space is basically vertical. So that obviously applies to Ethereum and matic alike. But we're on number three of the macro narratives, which is matic, which is the indian narrative. So what do you have? You have a financial system that has reached critical mass liquidity. The developer explosion is everywhere. You see the pictures of all the projects, and we have critical mass monetary velocity with however many billions of dollars are in aave. You have lending and borrowing, which creates money in terms of double entry bookkeeping.
00:09:51.532 - 00:10:32.650, Speaker B: And then you combine that with a billion plus people, and you got to understand the mentality of indian kids, adolescents, and not middle aged, but my age. I'm 38 and younger, but let's say 20 to 40. I used to manage a team of engineers in Hyderabad when I worked at American Express. And these boys are hungry. These boys are programmers. These boys are software engineers. And the country is filled with a population of engineers like probably no other country on the planet other than China.
00:10:32.650 - 00:11:15.650, Speaker B: The amount of engineers in India is probably larger than the amount of working people in the United States of America. The whole point of the narrative I'm trying to describe is a digital financial system just emerged called matic polygon. And they have hundreds of millions of engineers that are going to be exuberant from a nationalistic and a pride perspective to build and deploy and engage in seeking opportunity. So I think that is a massive, massive narrative.
00:11:15.950 - 00:12:01.928, Speaker A: I see. I never really thought about it that way, I guess. I mean, I live in California, in the US, so I don't really think about the entire global picture. And what you just said about the whole global narrative makes a lot of sense to me. And, yeah, the indian narrative is really interesting because, like, yeah, like, we. Every year we hear this, hear these news about, like, India banning crypto, but, like, we have all this, like, talented engineers in India that, you know, might feel like this national, like, this pride of, like, Polygon matic you know, that came out of India and these developers might build on Polygon instead of these other chains. And, you know, I think in your streams you often talk about like, GitHub activity and like, the amount of building that's occurring in these different blockchains.
00:12:01.928 - 00:12:45.444, Speaker A: And, you know, I think that's a metric that I think we all should, like, track in the coming months, in the coming years. It's like, what's the activity on Polygon? Because I feel like, I mean, I follow Polygon's Twitter account and I mean, every single day there's this like new partnerships, new products, and it's really nice to see. But to follow up on that question, obviously we're very bullish. Matic. And Matic has allowed a lot of retail to participate in Defi and actually use Defi for the first time. Because me personally, I don't have a large portfolio. So I mean, I've traded on the Ethereum blockchain, but I can't really do much else with it because I can't.
00:12:45.444 - 00:13:14.660, Speaker A: I, I can't afford $100 in transaction fees. So Matic has obviously been amazing, but this week, Arbitrum recently announced, launched their main net for developers, and they're rumored to have those apps deployed to the public in a few weeks. So that being said, how do you think these other L2s will affect the ecosystem? So our virtum and optimism, is that a threat to matic, or do you still see Matic maintaining that critical mass liquidity?
00:13:15.080 - 00:14:00.154, Speaker B: I see them as mutually exclusive and I see them operating in a, in a synergistic fashion. The number of dollars, relative dollars, in these systems is basically zero on the global scheme of things. So from a developer perspective, I think the nationalistic pride is going to encourage the young adults in India to deploy on the polygon network. I'm unsure how things will play out in China. It's another topic of conversation unto itself. But with regard to arbitram and optimism and even ZK roll ups, I think just as my narrative initially started, Ethereum is global. It spans the world.
00:14:00.154 - 00:14:34.794, Speaker B: It spans even India. So from a macro perspective, it will retain its lead. From a network effect standpoint, it will grow larger and further than the smaller economies. But that's what we're talking about here. We're talking about a digital economy. And just like you have the US dollar, which is the global reserve currency, it's a global economy in many regards. You still have an economy in Britain, you still got an economy in India, you got micro economies all over the place.
00:14:34.794 - 00:14:48.410, Speaker B: So they operate synergistically and in no way, shape or form throughout history. Has the concentration of financial activity and capital flow ever went to a single economy. Doesn't happen.
00:14:49.230 - 00:15:33.466, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. Yeah. I think one thing that medic has done really well is with their liquidity mining programs. So with Aave, they launched a $40 million program, and the Matic team allocated, like, roughly 1% of the tokenization to essentially, you know, give away tokens to use Aave. Right. And, like, that's what has been so great about AaVE automatic, is that you get paid to borrow and lend, and you can use your assets as collateral, borrow against it and get paid to do so, and then you can, you know, use that cash or whatever asset and just do a lot of things with the other DeFi applications. So what I noticed is that the AAVE rewards, so added a 1% of the matic rewards.
00:15:33.466 - 00:16:12.280, Speaker A: Half a percent was allocated from the timeline April to June of 2020 2021, and the other half percent is allocated from June 15 to the end of April of 2022. So that means that the matic rewards will be cut by roughly 80%. So do you see that as a threat to matic, or do you still, like. I'm just giving, like, a potentially bearish case scenario of matic, because for matic, yeah, because when those matic rewards go down, like, do you see, like, funds leaving matic and potentially going to maybe ardvitrum where there will be more liquidity mining incentives?
00:16:12.860 - 00:16:49.010, Speaker B: On the contrary, I actually see capital inflow just staying the same, if not increasing. You got to remember the Cresco Finn narrative. Those boys out of Switzerland hooking up with AavE because they got probably a couple of trillion dollars worth of family office capital wanting to deploy. The incentives are great for bootstrapping. It's a nice deployment of capital from an entrepreneurial perspective. Throw around a couple of bucks, get the critical mass liquidity, and jumpstart the engine of monetary velocity. But as of right now, you can earn two, 3%.
00:16:49.010 - 00:17:59.370, Speaker B: I could look at the numbers, but it's meaningful percent base APY on almost everything on AavE, meaningful percent base APY on curve on polygon. So if you compare that to negative interest rates in a lot of the deposit accounts for the global financial system, and dare we say, even the zero, zero, 2% interest rates in the continent, the United States, anything is better. So the complexity with trying to understand the capital flow of the global financial system is time horizon. Many folks are thinking it'll go down, it'll go up. But you're talking about over the next coming years, when a family office is losing millions of dollars a day, when they provide liquidity to a bank, they're going to say, why are they providing liquidity to a bank when they can provide liquidity to other people? And those other people pay them interest? Instead of the bank getting the profit, they get the profit.
00:17:59.870 - 00:18:30.186, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's why Aave is so beautiful. Like, using Aave every day, just like, oh, yeah. Like, this is what the ethos of DeFi is all about. There's no middleman. And without the middleman, the users heard of profits, and there's more to gain. Right? Also, in my past livestreams, I mentioned, or I speculate that Coinbase and other centralized exchanges is going to allow direct fiat on ramps from decentralized exchanges to arbitrum.
00:18:30.186 - 00:19:35.960, Speaker A: I think one of the biggest problems with Matic right now is that there is no easy on ramp from a centralized exchange. So if you're working with a few hundred dollars, you kind of have to go through binance smart chain, or you have to go through Ethereum and pay whatever fees you have to pay. So I think that this direct on ramp narrative for arbitrum and optimism is huge. And though it might not seem like much, I do think that this, like, if you think about the long tail of retail with, like, playing with a few hundred dollars, because I'm sure there's a lot of people that would love to, like, experiment with Defi, but they don't want to risk, like, four four figure sums to, like, use ethereum and, like, even matic. Right? So I think that, like, if arbitrum has a direct fear on ramp from Coinbase, I'm gonna become a boltart, and I'm just gonna, like, go all in or not all in, obviously, but I'm gonna, like, really go into arbitrum. So what are your thoughts on there? Like, what are your thoughts on, like, if decentralized exchanges direct, like, offer a direct on ramp, like, how quickly do you see, like, these tvls grow, like, total value locked?
00:19:36.870 - 00:20:36.530, Speaker B: Oh, there's nothing to invest in with regard to arbitram. There's no way to capitalize on it. What you've learned over the last months and year plus with the defi space is exactly the same methodology that you will use when arbitrum and optimism go live and deploy. But you will have the first mover advantage, you know, to apply your capital to curve and to lock it for ve curve. You've learned about convex finance and yearn and then the capacity to use derivative products to compound yield that are produced by these platforms. So what that means is as the on ramp you see playing out, capital will flow in because the friction is being reduced. And you know the best places to deploy that capital to capitalize on capital flow and velocity lending and borrowing.
00:20:36.530 - 00:21:14.432, Speaker B: So when people are lending and borrowing, they need to exchange die. For USDC, it's predominantly going through curve. And then if it's going, it's maybe a little bit of uniswap over. It's going through one inch, it's going through probably curve or uniswap. Or if it's going through Maca, you know, the Zero X aggregator, it's going through curve and uniswap. So all roads lead through these major Amm protocols. So all I see is not the speculation on an asset appreciating in the face of an immense amount of liquidity inflow.
00:21:14.432 - 00:21:42.030, Speaker B: I want to provide the liquidity so people that are throwing money at these protocols have a capacity to perform transactions. I want the transaction fees. I don't want to make, I don't want to make millions. I want to make 5%, 10%, 15%, so that every day I wake up in the morning, I have cash just like a business, just like going to work. So I'm a bullet also.
00:21:42.610 - 00:22:20.714, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we all are. I mean, once you start using these applications, it's hard not to be a boltard, right? I mean, you just see like all this, like this frictionless, like, transactions, etcetera. Yeah. And I think, I think you tweeted out, like, I forgot when like the market crashed, but we had like this 50% crash in like a period of a week or two weeks. And I think you had, you were providing liquidity on curve or some other amm and you, like, your APR has like went through the roof. So in terms of, like, in times of like crazy volatility, like being a market maker and like being at the liquidity provider, like, there's a lot to gain there, right. And you made a lot of fees.
00:22:20.714 - 00:22:31.790, Speaker A: So what are your thoughts on, like, I guess providing liquidity? I mean, you already mentioned it, but yeah, that's everything. Yeah, I think it's like the general advice that everyone should hear about.
00:22:33.290 - 00:22:56.346, Speaker B: It's all about cash flow. Nothing else matters. Because if you have an asset that's illiquid or an asset that is stagnant equity, which brings up a variety of assets, for instance. Well, I don't want to downplay the potential of very popular assets. But let's say an asset has no capacity to operate at the Defi space. You can't borrow against it. So you only have literally one option is to sell it.
00:22:56.346 - 00:23:19.534, Speaker B: Let's say you've been holding this asset since like, 2019. You're going to watch it go 100 x on the money, and you're going to sell an asset that you've held onto for all these years. Nobody's going to want to sell an asset they've held on for all these years. What you want to do is extract the equity. It's the same thing like a house. Your house goes ten x on the money. The first thing that doesn't come to mind is to sell the home that you live in.
00:23:19.534 - 00:23:46.950, Speaker B: You refinance it, you get a HELOC, a home equity line of credit. You extract the equity from it while you're living in the house. I want assets on the balance sheet where I could tap the equity to create working capital, to put it to work, because I want those assets. It's not even that. The assets are guaranteed to just appreciate. They're going to be volatile all over the place. With a long enough time horizon, all these assets are going to appreciate, especially if talking about the top tier majors.
00:23:46.950 - 00:24:02.992, Speaker B: Give it time, everyone. Expand your time horizon. Every asset on your balance sheet should be working. If your assets on your balance sheet are not working, you're missing out on the innovation that makes this market different than 2017 and 2018.
00:24:03.176 - 00:24:43.370, Speaker A: Yeah. And the concept of stagnant equity is very good because, I mean, if you buy a coin on some centralized exchange, that's stagnant equity. Right? I mean, because most of these coins, they, like, dilute current shareholder or token holders, because through liquidity mining incentives and whatnot, you know, they're printing more tokens every single day. So you're like, essentially losing, I guess, equity, I guess, by just holding them into decentralized exchanges. And if you don't put them to work, you're not doing it right. So I guess Noah and I, we advise everyone to at least look into DeFi and put your coins to work and use them as collateral, borrow against it. Be a liquidity provider, a market maker, and generate cash flow.
00:24:43.750 - 00:25:03.330, Speaker B: The most important thing is actually for the advice I give to new participants. Stop buying assets. Stop buying crypto tokens. Start with cash. Buy Dai, buy USDC. Buy USDT. Buy GUSD, buy pure cash dollars.
00:25:03.330 - 00:25:51.290, Speaker B: Take $50 and you throw it onto Aave and watch the cash come in, watch the interest rate in real time, every second of every day, come in and just remember in about. Was it like a day worth of interest on Aave? You got more interest than your bank will give you in an entire year. And the reason I always tell people this is because it's $50. You go out to dinner for $50, or you do an experiment that shows you a way to manage capital that makes everything that you knew about the legacy financial system turn on its head. Who keeps cash in a bank? It's the most irrational thing I've ever seen. You. Anyone who deposits cash to a bank is a liquidity provider for a bank where they give you nothing.
00:25:51.290 - 00:25:56.530, Speaker B: Why not be a liquidity provider for a bank where they give you everything?
00:25:57.350 - 00:26:28.360, Speaker A: Yeah. And if it aave, you are the bank, which is like the whole bank list narrative that everyone in DeFi loves. Okay, so I want to transition the conversation into more like, I'm going to transition to, like, more of a q and a session where I'll just ask you a couple of questions and you'll provide some alpha for, you know, retail clubs like me that's trying to make it in crypto. So, first, what is your most proud achievement in crypto? Because you've been in the space for six years, so you can answer this in any way like, what's your most proud achievement?
00:26:29.900 - 00:27:17.010, Speaker B: Excuse me? Getting into macro financials, I have achieved significant capital gains and I have. I could have done better, probably. My proud achievement is the combination of digging into macro financials and how they work, from central bank monetary policy to the concepts of inflation, deflation and velocity, and applying that to crypto assets and seeing how they're different, yet the same. Different, yet the same. So many similarities, so many analogous properties, yet they really change everything. And it's not. That's not opium, that's not belief.
00:27:17.010 - 00:28:01.644, Speaker B: As a scientist, as an engineer, these assets are digitally tangible, which is a fascinating, almost contradictory statement, digitally tangible. And that's the thing that boomers don't have a capacity to process. They think because something is physically tangible, that it has more meaning than adolescence. I believe that's a true statement, digitally tangible. But that's a hard thing to digest because tangible, by definition, is physically interactive. But I think digitally tangible is an interesting expression that I can hang my hat on. So that that's probably my.
00:28:01.644 - 00:28:11.324, Speaker B: My most proud achievement is having a much broader perspective than the vast majority of market participants looking into the crypto.
00:28:11.372 - 00:28:52.704, Speaker A: Space and the idea of, like, you know, we can always do better. It's like, for me, for example, I feel like, I guess before the dump, right, the 50% dump I had, I didn't have that much cash as part of my portfolio. I told myself I would raise cash because there's aave automatic I can it on curve, etcetera. But greed got the better of me. So, you know, I made that mistake once, and, you know, it's okay to make a mistake once, right? But you have to learn from it and never make the same mistake twice. Okay? That being said, the next question I have for you is, what is your biggest regret in crypto? I'm sure you have a lot given. You know, you've been in the space, and so all the assets are so volatile, and we all make mistakes.
00:28:52.704 - 00:28:59.340, Speaker A: But if you could share with us, like, no, what mistake have you made in the past? And, like, what is your biggest regret?
00:29:00.000 - 00:29:25.786, Speaker B: My biggest regret was last week. I could have had it handled it better. I was 33% cash principal Tuesday before the crash. As in the night before the crash, I had 33% of my capital in cash. And I'm watching the chart plummet, and I'm like, oh, what an incredible opportunity to buy. I deployed cash too quick, and I bought at the bottom. I bought everything at the bottom.
00:29:25.786 - 00:29:55.846, Speaker B: And the market was so volatile on the way up, on the way down, on the way up, on the way down. And I was over trading, and I was capitalizing. And all said and done, I was able to build back to about 15, 20% down from all time high. As of right now, I'm sitting at about 33% down from all time high. I could have done better. And that's only something you ever see in hindsight. I needed to wait.
00:29:55.846 - 00:30:15.274, Speaker B: I needed to be more patient. I had the right strategy. The market's exuberant. You allocate cash to your principal, you accumulate cash. Right now, I'm not cash. The market's not exuberant. This is the time that I see to deploy cash, partially because it's contrarian ideology.
00:30:15.274 - 00:30:52.500, Speaker B: I will do everything in my power to do the opposite of what the average market participant will do. Markets on fire doge is $0.70. Yeah, I'm going to be in cash markets dumping. No one's not going to go any lower. Yeah, I'm not going to be in cash, so I could have played it better, and I lost a lot of money doing so the way I did it. But from, from March of last year, you know, the pandemic crash, up about 2000% to 2200%, give or take. And that's so I'm proud of that.
00:30:52.500 - 00:31:00.500, Speaker B: I wouldn't mind that extra, you know, 500,000% tacked on, but it's okay. We can do better. Everyone.
00:31:01.200 - 00:31:27.670, Speaker A: Yeah. And just curious, I wasn't, I'm, like, pretty new to defi. I, like, really delved into the space this year in 2021, and I wasn't a market participant in March of 2020. So, like, how did you handle that crash? Were you heavy cash leading up to it, or, like, like, I'm sure that was, like, a really crazy time. So I just want to get your thoughts on, like, or like, how you dealt with that situation.
00:31:28.050 - 00:31:44.110, Speaker B: I bought a bitcoin of $3,000. Bought. We didn't know where things were going. It was a very different narrative at the time. We didn't have Defi. There was zero defi. I mean, Uniswap was doing nothing.
00:31:44.110 - 00:32:13.524, Speaker B: And I was a buyer predominantly because there was no other place to allocate capital in the legacy financial system. The system was falling apart. It was horrible. And I didn't trust anything under the Trump administration. I didn't trust any of the stock market going vertical. And it's nice to see the stock market leveling out right now. And actually what's happening right now in the crypto space, I really like to see it.
00:32:13.524 - 00:32:33.064, Speaker B: Markets don't go straight up. At least healthy markets. Healthy markets go horizontal. Healthy markets don't go down. They don't dump. Healthy markets churn like ice cream, churn like butter, you know, just literally going nowhere. Up, down, up, down.
00:32:33.064 - 00:33:14.946, Speaker B: That's a healthy market where there's a balance of buyers and sellers. If your market's going up, there's an imbalance, that's an instability, and that's not necessarily a good sign. So I was a buyer in 2020, and that worked out well. I was on a fun note when Curve launched, when curve especially launched rendezvous, I was probably the first ten liquidity providers. They, they gave me so much curve. I love curve. Curve is such a wonderful platform.
00:33:14.946 - 00:33:29.840, Speaker B: Every single curve I've ever gotten is just locked. It's just a wonderful platform. But the same with convex. They give a nice airdrop for v curve holders. All locked. I'll never let go of that stuff. That stuff is pure gold.
00:33:31.340 - 00:33:34.556, Speaker A: Yeah. And you have your curve locked for like four years, right?
00:33:34.748 - 00:34:03.492, Speaker B: 4000 years. That is pure gold right there. The curve monetary policy is one of the most powerful monetary policies that give central banks a run for the money. It's the ultimate MMT monetary policy. But not that MMT is necessarily a good thing. Especially in the legacy financial system. We all know the debate that macro financial folks talk about with sound money and MMT and the tragedy of what the Fed's doing, monetizing the deficit.
00:34:03.492 - 00:34:13.880, Speaker B: But curve is the ultimate MMT monetary policy. Hyper decaying hyperinflation coupled with hyper deflation to prevent debasement.
00:34:15.180 - 00:34:30.090, Speaker A: Go deeper into that point, like hyper inflationary and hyper deflationary. I'm not like a curve expert, right. So I want to hear your bullish take on curve. Can you go into more detail on why youre such a heavy curve believer?
00:34:30.550 - 00:35:05.926, Speaker B: So inflation decreases the value of the assets in circulation, because now theres more assets in circulation, people are encouraged to sell. So if you notice, when curve first launched, it just went straight down and kept going down and down and down. Down to like $0.25 is where I got my entry. For the vast majority of my entry, it took a while for the deflationary pressures to overcome the inflation. So curve is a decaying inflationary monetary policy. Inflationary mean it's growing fast, there's a huge amount of emissions, but that will decrease, I believe, in August.
00:35:05.926 - 00:36:34.022, Speaker B: So it'll become which disinflation, which is it will deflate a bit, or it could become increasingly disinflationary. A lot of semantics involved in this game because people are encouraged to lock their curve for four years to receive platform transaction fees. That is an immense deflationary pressure that is removing supply from circulation. That causes supply disruption. That means there's less assets available to sell, which means when someone wants to buy an asset, they now have to go to a market that has less assets that they could buy from. Now, what's interesting is that if you just have the supply disruption, which there are assets that have that kind of monetary policy, like Badger has a monetary policy and it has incentivized supply disruption. Curve has the longevity because platform transaction fees in four years time, if ve curve holders, if someone's making, let's say, $500 a week right now, and in five years time, four years time when the lock expires, that $500 a week is $5,000 a week or $20,000 a week, do you think they're going to unlock their curve and sell it? It's a, it's a commodity.
00:36:34.022 - 00:36:56.380, Speaker B: It's a very powerful asset to be had. So I just, I see the, I see rolling locks. People are just going to lock it up and lock it up because they don't want the curve. They don't want to sell the curve. What they want is the platform transaction fees. It's like a dividend from a company on a future financial system.
00:36:56.880 - 00:37:38.410, Speaker A: I see. Yeah, that's very insightful. And I guess you talk about the monetary policy, right? I feel like it's similar to Bancorp BNT, where like almost like 80% of the BNT is locked up. And it kind of incentivizes, like, like holders to just like, lock it up and like, and have the current token holders, like, accrue value. So you mentioned that, you know, you bought curb roughly twenty five cents, and you're like locking it up forever, essentially. But you also mentioned that, you know, it took a while for your thesis to play out, right? Like, it went sideways or down for like, however many months before it recently, like gone up a lot of. So, how do you build conviction for these particular projects when the price tells you otherwise?
00:37:40.310 - 00:39:04.560, Speaker B: Comes with experience, and it comes with that proudest moment I mentioned earlier, doing my due diligence into macro financials and understanding what made the legacy financial systems what they are, what gave the good times to economies, what presented the bad times, understanding the conversation that Jerome Powell and the central banks around the world have on a frequent basis, inflation, deflation, and crumbling monetary velocity. So, what I rely on is myself and my understanding of these systems to choose assets that fit my requirements. So, curve is outside the scope of my balance sheet ideology. But what it does? What does it do? It provides me capital to deploy in the balance sheet. So it does have a relationship to my prevailing or most important ideology, the business. So it provides that revenue stream, just like RenVMs. Renvms, they produce a constant income stream, which, in theory, speculatively, will grow to be significant over the coming years, adding more capital to the balance sheet, allowing me to borrow more capital, allowing me to put more capital to work in order to compound that recurring revenue stream.
00:39:04.900 - 00:39:59.560, Speaker A: I see. So it seems like, I guess, your mindset and how you allocate capital and how you look at your balance sheet, it seems like you have your balance sheet, which is maybe that's on Aave ometic, and you have these different entities, let's say, on curve Bancor, generating cash flow. And it's like a small business, it's like a startup that you have that's like giving you dividends, and those dividends you reinvest back to your balance sheet, to allocate capital elsewhere. So I think that kind of mindset is really valuable to newer DeFi participants or just like in crypto in general, because I think a majority of folks, they just think of crypto as a speculative thing that either goes up or down. But once you start thinking about these assets in that way, you start to understand, like, oh, yeah. Like, these different projects have this type of monetary policy, and this type of monetary policy accrues value to this token. It might play out over 24 months.
00:39:59.560 - 00:40:35.450, Speaker A: But this is my thesis. I'm going to stick to it, and obviously, it's done tremendously well for you. That being said, what has been your biggest surprise in this particular bull market? Let's say 2021? Like, not. Not doge and these dot coins. Like, I think that caught everyone off guard. But is there, like, anything that, like, really caught you by surprise? So, for example, like, you know, you were bearish, like this type of sector, but it turned out to be, like, a really tremendous investment opportunity, or you were very bullish. This type of sector, but it turned out to be a total, total dud.
00:40:35.450 - 00:40:37.710, Speaker A: So what has been your biggest surprise so far?
00:40:40.620 - 00:41:32.350, Speaker B: All right, well, you could say that DeFi summer 2020 had an ICO rush of sorts. But what's not just surprising, but it's also relieving, if you think about that, what I just said, jack shit came out of 2017 and 2018. Not to be profane or anything, nothing came out of it at all. I find Bancor and maker were from the old school days, so a couple of things came out of it, and Bancorp was a massive ICO, but the vast majority of everything is gone. What came out of 2020? Look at the ecosystem that's on Ethereum. Look at the ecosystem. Those charts.
00:41:32.350 - 00:42:08.720, Speaker B: Those ecosystem charts on Polygon, those ecosystem charts on Polkadot and Cosmos, even the ecosystem chart for BSC, it's massive. That is the. It's not even the antithesis of 2017 2018. So what I like to say I do well is I observe the disruption, the systemic change. So that is my biggest surprise, or the best observation. It's extraordinarily different than the way it was historically. Everything.
00:42:08.720 - 00:42:27.280, Speaker B: Everything has changed in an extraordinary way. So these prices are absolutely irrelevant. What's important is the way legacy financial systems operate and looking at the properties of the crypto space, looking for the exact same properties that we see in legacy finance.
00:42:28.140 - 00:42:44.470, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you see a DeFi summer coming again in 2021? I feel like a lot of people are speculating, and especially with, like, these matic arbitrum optimism, like launching, that, it makes defi more accessible. Do you see, like, a. Like a defi summer, like, v two coming?
00:42:44.810 - 00:42:46.818, Speaker B: It'd be strange not to say it.
00:42:46.994 - 00:42:58.588, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, too. I feel like a lot of people think the bull market's over, and, like, I'm not gonna say it's not over. I mean, there's. There's always a non zero chance that it is over, but if you think.
00:42:58.604 - 00:43:01.160, Speaker B: About what is over mean down?
00:43:01.500 - 00:43:04.156, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I guess, like, price.
00:43:04.228 - 00:43:51.840, Speaker B: Where's it going down to with why? So the price is irrelevant. And that's what, that. That is what I hang my hat on. What matters is where do you see it in a couple years? And what we have now from 2020 to 2021? Wait four years, everything changes. And that's just for bitcoin. You have any idea what this shit's going to be like in 2025, 2030? These are the assets to accumulate. Every single one of every person that watches this video will be getting up and going to work tomorrow, no matter what, and the day after for the next four years, the only logical course of action is to accumulate revenue producing assets.
00:43:51.840 - 00:44:35.610, Speaker B: Whether it could be. Look, if you go on Twitter and you follow the boomer mid age, the forties and the fifties, the folks that are into dividend stocks and preferred stocks for the yield. Yeah, stuff like that. They're talking about the same thing we're talking about, except they not seeing what we see. They don't see the digital, the digital digitally tangible. These are the assets to accumulate for the next five years or the next 20. Just continuously accumulate, increase the revenue stream, and in five years time, it's going to be extraordinary.
00:44:36.470 - 00:44:50.860, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I'm very. I mean, we're all like. Like we mentioned earlier, like, we're both bold hearts when it comes to crypto. And I feel like even if price goes down, it's like, money's not leaving the space, right? Like these. The TVL on aave on Matic, it's not gonna leave.
00:44:52.040 - 00:44:53.000, Speaker B: Here's a fun one.
00:44:53.080 - 00:44:55.600, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, go for it.
00:44:55.760 - 00:45:21.400, Speaker B: Check this out. Let's say you got 100 grand and you earn a 3% interest and 100 grand with a matic, you're in a 3% interest for the next four years. That 100 grand worth of matic turns into 20 grand worth of matic. You're still earning 3%, the same 3%. You're still earning the same amount of matic. So the principal will go down. The amount of matic you're earning is the same.
00:45:21.400 - 00:45:41.280, Speaker B: So in four years time, when the principal goes up in value, you made all that interest for all those years denominated in that higher price point. All that matters is your interest rate and enough time horizon to see the big picture.
00:45:41.740 - 00:46:02.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And it's easy to get caught up in short term price movements and feel down sometimes. But, yeah, I guess what you're saying is what matters is collecting these tokens. It's about the number of tokens that you're accumulating instead of the dollar value. Would you agree with that?
00:46:03.390 - 00:46:51.504, Speaker B: Absolutely. Kevin O'Leary said that, I believe he said when he was talking to pomp, there was one, two words, two words that he said, surmise, a very meaningful concept. More coin. He didn't mean, I know exactly what he meant, and he meant exactly what I'm saying. He said that because he said that to account for what we know as volatility goes up a billion percent, it goes down a billion percent. And all that matters is youre constantly getting more coin, which means youre constantly generating increased revenue over time, because he sees it as a business as well.
00:46:51.672 - 00:47:10.140, Speaker A: Preston. Yeah, I think as more institutional money flows in, do you see these yields going down? As long as more institutions enter and more, I guess, wealthier individuals search for these yields when they can't get amazing yields in the traditional market.
00:47:11.000 - 00:47:33.668, Speaker B: So everything that we experienced in Defi summer 2020, that's the ico phase. That's garbage. It's absolutely junk. 1000%, 500%, 100%. It's not even remotely conceivable to be sustainable. And the incentivized yields will evaporate because they will become trivial. The incentivize aave.
00:47:33.668 - 00:48:13.450, Speaker B: This is a blessing. Anyone missing out on these extra 1015 20% is missing out on probably one of the luckiest opportunities in the last God knows how long, 100 years, whatever, because they're gone. Liquidity flows in, those yields are diluted to zero, basically zero. Those, the time periods eclipse, and those yields are done. They just expire, and all we're remaining left with, all that remains is the base APY, which I expect to go up. More trans, more transactions. Those numbers are going to go up.
00:48:15.160 - 00:48:51.840, Speaker A: I see, I see. Yeah. So I want to wrap up the conversation. It's been great talking to you, and I'm sure a lot of our audience has gotten a lot of alpha as well. But obviously, you've been in this space for six years. You've learned a lot along the way, and now you have this business that's generating cash flow and, yeah, I mean, for people like me, right, who's newer into the crypto space, what mistakes do you see newer participants in crypto make and, like, what would be, like, your biggest advice and like, can you share some alpha? And, like, how do you make it? How do I make it in crypto?
00:48:52.260 - 00:49:28.712, Speaker B: Same way I did. And I didn't bet the farm. I've gotten lucky in a couple bets, but over my last year and a half, three bets, I made three bets that have made the capital. So folks are out there deploying way too much capital. Back in 2020, I bought into Bancor Kyber and synthetix, probably about 30% of my capital at the time, and that changed everything. I wrote synthetix from seventy cents to seven dollars. That was a beauty.
00:49:28.712 - 00:49:45.100, Speaker B: And I still have synthetics, and it was all free because it's compounding interest. Kyber hasn't done as well as I would have liked. And bancorpental, that obviously went from, like $0.30 last year to as high as $910 this year. So that's. And it's also compounding. Just incredibly compounding.
00:49:45.100 - 00:50:05.232, Speaker B: So the second one was. Was rook. It was like sixty five dollars to eight hundred dollars. And then matic, I saw it, probably thirty five cents. And the same thing with Rook. So I saw it at like $18 and went to 65. And Matic I saw at 35.
00:50:05.232 - 00:50:33.020, Speaker B: And I really saw the narrative change, the story change. And I got in at that, went obviously closer to $3. And that's still my largest position. So the most important alpha I could tell you guys is it doesn't matter your portfolio size. Do the exact same thing I do now, which is not the same thing I did back in 2020. It's better. So it doesn't matter the portfolio size.
00:50:33.020 - 00:51:08.600, Speaker B: You want the business, take 1% of your portfolio. So I have the business, but just as you mentioned, I have curve, the renvms and a bunch of other stuff. Those are small. That's like 3% for curve because it grew from basically a tiny portfolio holding. But I also have Polkadot, Cosmos, Bancor Kava, ban protocol, Blocknet, stakenet, Firo. All these 0.5% bets all over the place, that's where the money's made.
00:51:08.600 - 00:51:40.210, Speaker B: The big money isn't made with the big stuff. The big money is the stuff you want to protect and generate a constant, predictable revenue stream. But it's those 0.5% bets that if you have 100 grand portfolio and you take a $1000 bet and it turns into 100 grandd go. So that's what changes everything. So what. What wrecks people is trying to turn that hundred grand into 200 grand.
00:51:40.210 - 00:52:01.250, Speaker B: You want to turn the $1,000 into 100 grand, risk adjusted returns and take your foot off the gas pedal, take a step back, deploy cash, seek advice, talk to people, ask questions, and whatever you do, don't watch bitboy.
00:52:02.470 - 00:52:17.510, Speaker A: All right, I guess we'll wrap up the stream. Sorry, wrap up the interview with that comment. Do not watch bitboy. That is the biggest alpha you can share with you guys. Unsubscribe to Bitboy. Don't listen to him. Alright, so thank you for this discussion.
00:52:17.510 - 00:52:30.100, Speaker A: It was really useful. So for anyone that's watching that wants to follow you, where can they find you? And is there any group that you're a part of that you want to promote or just talk about?
00:52:30.520 - 00:53:06.478, Speaker B: Sure. So I do daily streams at 11:30 a.m. on YouTube. Noah Seidman, very easy to find me Twitter. Noah Sideman in my Twitter profile is a link to YouTube, my discord forum, which has a lot of people at this point, and you're welcome to join. And we're talking about these topics day in, day out, trying to understand the market from a different perspective, trying to do things the opposite, the way the vast majority of the market handles these things. Our motto is, be different and we could do better.
00:53:06.478 - 00:53:22.160, Speaker B: And that's the truth. So if anyone has any thoughts, ideas, Taiki's got this covered, man. You're an ambassador at this point. You know the deal. You know how to be different. So you're doing just fine, my friend.
00:53:22.280 - 00:53:38.580, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'll try to make more contrarian bets to you. It's like when the market's bullish, raise some cash. When the market thinks it's gonna go to zero, deploy that cash. All right. Thank you for this conversation, and I hope to talk to you again at some point in the future.
00:53:38.880 - 00:53:40.960, Speaker B: It's a pleasure. You have a good one. I'll talk to you soon, my friend.
