00:00:01.080 - 00:01:04.500, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyky here. And welcome to the market update for May 2. So we have a lot to cover. So let's get right into it. So I tweeted this Saturday night, and I was like, wow, what a brutal start to the weekend, because I felt like there was a lot of capitulation that happened on Saturday, depending on whatever market you were in, right? Like, we had bad news after bad news after bad news, right? We had bad news in the morning, in the afternoon, at night, and we saw some altcoins go down 10%, some go down 20%, and some go down like 40, 50%, like Defi Kingdoms and Juul. So let's first cover joule first, right? Because this is, like, a darling for me and for, you know, some members of the community, because I feel like it was one of the projects that, you know, a lot of people just, like, believed in the team, right? Like, when you're putting money into, like, a gamefi project, it's so speculative that you kind of have to bet on the team to execute, because in the short term, there really isn't a game. But you're hoping that, you know, like, you're farming, you're, you know, earning whatever yield, and maybe like four months from now, there's gonna be a game, right, where there's actually an influx of users.
00:01:04.500 - 00:01:43.710, Speaker A: And that's what we were kind of betting on. But the problem that Defi kingdom has had and what created a lot of outrage was that there was this problem with the mining quests, right? So obviously, you know, when you have lock jewel, it's gonna start unlocking later this year. But if you want to start unlocking your lock jewel, then you can buy a set of miners and then, like, let them go on a mining quest. And, you know, Shashir kind of goes over, like, what actually happened, right? There was this. It wasn't really an exploit. I mean, I mean, it doesn't really matter what you call it, but there was, like, this bug, a glitch where, let's say I have a bunch of log jewel. I have, like, 20 different metamask wallets, eats each with a set of miners.
00:01:43.710 - 00:02:31.760, Speaker A: I can start a quest on my first metamask wallet, and once it starts, I can transfer the logjule to a second wallet, start the quest, and then kind of do that. You know, just keep doing that and, like, you know, maximize my locked jewel rewards. And if you have, like, a bot, like, code this, then there was, like, one individual or an entity just locking or unlocking a bunch of jewel just like dumping it in the open market, right? And this caused, I mean I'm sure this was part of the reason like price didn't do so well. And you know, I mean this is a bug, right? It happens. I mean, obviously not great, right? Obviously not great, but it happens. But the problem, and I think the main reason people were so angered was because the Defi Kingdoms team apparently knew this back in January 31. And I did confirm this, I think.
00:02:31.760 - 00:03:13.712, Speaker A: So, you know, I'm just presenting the information. But essentially, you know, the team knew about this back then. Not like there was like no one like taking advantage of this back then. And maybe they were too busy like you know, tripping Crystalvale or something, but they didn't really address it. And you know, once the community found out that there was like this entity just like dumping a bunch of jewel that they unlocked through the mining problem, people were like, oh my God, what's happening is this inside job? Why didn't the team dress this immediately? And it was a lot of anger, a lot of panic and the discord was a mess. There's also, I mean, Frisky, the founder of Defi Kingdoms also wrote this article. I'll link this in the description, but clarifying loot swap.
00:03:13.712 - 00:03:52.630, Speaker A: So loot Swap was like some janky project on Harmony like way back when. And apparently this was like one of the few like first projects that Frisky's ever worked on. He left the project once like, you know, the token, like pumped and dumped and that's like, that's why he like left the project. The joint Defi Kingdoms. I mean, you can read this too, right? But you know, essentially like, I don't think this is that big of a deal, right? I mean, you know, he worked on a project like the, like the team that he worked with, like wasn't that great. And he started Defi kingdoms. But I guess the problem was that, you know, he, because he essentially came out and said that loot Swap was like basically his first ever DeFi project.
00:03:52.630 - 00:04:38.304, Speaker A: It's like, okay, like, are you really an expert when it comes to designing a Defi project, to be honest? Like, to me, like, I don't like to judge people based off of like, you know, their, like their resume. I just like to judge people based off of like their work. That's kind of like the crypto ethos, right? The part of the beauty in crypto is that you can have anonymous developers, anonymous founders, create quality projects and, you know, you don't, like, you don't care if they went to like a good school, you don't care if they worked at like Goldman or whatever, Google or something. Like if the dev is good, right, and he's a good actor, then, you know, we're gonna rally behind that founder. So that's kind of how I think about it. But essentially, you know, but I guess the TLR is that people were so upset with this mining thing that they didn't address that. When, you know, this loot swap thing came out.
00:04:38.304 - 00:05:19.466, Speaker A: It's like, oh my God, like, who the hell are you? Like, are you rugging us? And to be honest, at this point, the way I'm viewing Defi kingdoms is that like, you know, it's. I guess the problem is that with Defi kingdoms, I feel like their biggest asset was their brand, the integrity of the team, and the community's trust on that team. And once that trust and integrity is breached even a little bit, it kind of destroys the fundamentals of Defi kingdoms. And, you know, the team is trying to, you know, I mean, they had like this ama, it was like an hour and a half long. They kind of addressed everything. The first key was like, I'm sorry, like, you know, I didn't mean for this to happen. And, you know, we're gonna work our asses off to get your trust back.
00:05:19.466 - 00:06:14.054, Speaker A: And one of the things that got announced today was that, you know, apparently like the entire team is gonna fully dox themselves. They're gonna get on a Zoom call, they're gonna be like, okay, my name is yadda, yadda, yadda, I am 30 years old and I work, I worked at this company, right? They're going to fully dox themselves in order to try to get the community trust back. I'm not here to say whether or not, oh, like, I'm buying it up because I'm not buying the dip. The way I perceive the project right now is that right now, I mean, even if Defi kingdoms were to come back, which is a big if, it's gonna take them months for it to come back. So at this, you know, with that in mind, you know, like I think we all have, if you're in a project, we all have some amount of lock jewel, right, that's going to start unlocking later this year. I know the documentation says July, but it's most likely going to start unlocking August, September, or even October because the documentation assumed that harmony block times would be 2 seconds. And they kind of designed it for, you know, assuming two second block times.
00:06:14.054 - 00:06:59.646, Speaker A: You know, it's going to start unlocking twelve months from July. But because harmony blockchain is like sometimes down, doesn't really work. It's sometimes like 3 seconds, 4 seconds for a period of a few months. So likely it's gonna start unlocking. Maybe best case, August, September, right? So you know, I sold, I mean I hold some stuff on Crystalville, but I essentially like, you know, got rid of most of my bags and I'm looking at my locked jewel to capture any upside that I could potentially get, right. Because let's say this does come back, right? I mean maybe take six months but at that point like my jewel is starting to unlock and yes, I, if the game comes back, I wish I would have bought like a dollar or like $2 or whatever, but you know, it's not really worth the risk for me at least. So that's kind of how I'm viewing it.
00:06:59.646 - 00:07:20.282, Speaker A: And I know a lot of people were hurt by this. It's like, oh my God, like frisky. Like I thought we loved you. But you know, at this point the team just has to deliver, right? I mean there's nothing we can do. There's nothing the team can do other than deliver, right. Either they dox themselves and deliver and you know, they get our trust back, the community's trust back, or they doxed themselves and the project never comes back. Right.
00:07:20.282 - 00:07:50.740, Speaker A: There's no way to know. Right. But for me, I just wanted to take risk off and I'm viewing my locked jewel as like my vested jewel. I guess, you know that everyone's gonna start to unlock the next bad news that we had, right. I felt like the mining thing was like a Friday slash Thursday and then it really got big on Saturday. And then the, the next big thing that happened on Saturday, right, was that this phantom whale got like liquidated for a bunch of FTM. And you know, this.
00:07:50.740 - 00:08:27.232, Speaker A: Yeah, essentially, you know, this person had like, I don't know, like $40 million with FTM on screen and its health factor was like essentially a one 1.01. This was a screenshot from that day, right? I mean, health rate is under one. So like this person was on the verge of getting liquidated. And you know, currently this wallet has $13 million in FTM. And I think at the beginning of the day this like used to be like $50 million, right? So this guy got wrecked. There's some screenshots, right? There's a lot of anger within the community. It's like, oh my God, like, you know this person like Phantom king, like he was like, pumping and dumping.
00:08:27.232 - 00:09:10.342, Speaker A: You know, this is like, so much anger and, you know, just. No one was, like, feeling it, right? Like, no one was feeling it. And even prominent members of the Phantom community was like, yeah, like, the chain is kind of messed up, right? You know, it's really rough out there, right? And, you know, the thing with all these blockchains, like, the thing with every EVM chain, right? Like, we talk about avalanche, phantom, whatever, right? Like ethereum, like, they're all going to have issues, right? It's EBM doesn't really scale that well, right? Even, like, rust, like, Solana is trying to fix a scalability problem, but even that doesn't. Like, even Solana doesn't scale that well. So whenever the crypto markets, the Defi markets get really stressed, these changes go down. And, I mean, phantom didn't go down, but, you know, the. The gas was like 50,000.
00:09:10.342 - 00:09:26.050, Speaker A: Right. It was, it was basically unusable. And, you know, this happened with solidly. This happens when there's, like, a lot of activity on the platform. And, you know, I don't think phantom is cooked. I mean, it's definitely cooked in the short term, for sure. The sentiment there is, like, in the gutters.
00:09:26.050 - 00:09:41.830, Speaker A: But, you know, I still think in the long. In the grand scheme of things, if the phantom foundation keeps shipping, right, Michael Kong and company, I think the project is fine. Right. But, yeah, it's so many headwinds, right? Like, solidly. I mean, that was bad. Andre leaving, that was bad. I mean, like liquidation.
00:09:41.830 - 00:10:03.900, Speaker A: Like the phantom whale being liquidated, that's not bad. The chain being incredibly congested when the whale was being liquidated, not bad. People are leaving the ecosystem. And you can see this in, like, the uni whales, right? I mean, Phantom, like, there hasn't been a day. I mean, I guess there's like one day on April 14, but in the last 30 days, there's only been outflows. Right? There's only been outflows. So it's definitely rough out there.
00:10:03.900 - 00:10:21.056, Speaker A: And, you know, but there is a flashing buy signal that is showing up for Phantom, right? And that is the Tezos indicator. Right? Like, I've often mentioned that. Hey, like, whenever Phantom gets below the market cap, you just buy. You just buy. Right? Like, don't get me wrong, I am not buying. Right? Not. Not financial advice.
00:10:21.056 - 00:10:42.796, Speaker A: I am not buying. But, you know, if you do, like Phantom, right, and you, like, don't have exposure, and you always wanted exposure. Tezos 2.2 billion market cap Phantom $1.9 million market cap like, you know, like, you know, I'm not saying it's a bottom, but historically, you know, this has been a really good buy signal. Yeah. So, like I said, phantom has significant headwinds.
00:10:42.796 - 00:11:02.030, Speaker A: It's not going to be, you know, fixed overnight. It's probably take weeks, months. But, yeah, Tezos indicator is flashing a buy signal. Okay, next, let's talk about Solana. Right. It also went down, to be honest, like, like, I'm highlighting, like, defi kingdom's Phantom and Solana. But, like, every chain is, like, you know, is having issues.
00:11:02.030 - 00:11:24.864, Speaker A: Right. I mean, not all chains, like, avalanche is, like, doing fine, whatnot, but, you know, like, these chains is, like, not doing that well. And Solana went down again. I think it went down for 7 hours just because there was a bunch of people trying to mint nfts. And this is a screenshot from Nicholas, and he mentioned that. Yeah. Like, they're probably gonna shut down Nft minting because the bots that are trying to mint nfts on Solana, it's causing congestion.
00:11:24.864 - 00:11:48.778, Speaker A: And I don't think Solana has, like, a gas bidding system. So, you know, even when the blockchain gets congested, it doesn't really raise the cost of doing a transaction. And, you know, I mean, I don't know, like, what they're trying to go for, but, yeah, it's, it's just, it's going down. And there's a, now there's this troll account called Solana Inc. Saying that, hey, like, please don't contact us outside of business hours from 09:00 a.m. to 05:00 p.m. eastern time.
00:11:48.778 - 00:12:26.756, Speaker A: Kind of, kind of saying that, hey, like, you know, the network does not run 24/7 so. Yeah, it's kind of funny, right? It's kind of funny, right? Not funny if you're holding crypto assets, right? Because, you know, like, if Solana goes down, then, like, a bunch of other l ones is, like, dump. Because, you know, everything in crypto is correlated, right? And, you know, people hold a bunch of these l ones, so if they're losing a bunch of money on one l one, then they're gonna sell some other one to, you know, rebalance their portfolio, raise cash and whatnot. So, you know, Saturday was a really brutal day, actually. Like, I felt like on May. Yeah, last May 2021. Oh, that was, like, wow.
00:12:26.756 - 00:12:48.162, Speaker A: Like, the, the main liquidations was, like, almost a year ago. Like, quick. Like, it's crazy how short, or it's crazy how in crypto, like, it feels like we've been here for, like, five years. But, you know, the main liquidations was, like, less than a year ago, right. It's kind of crazy. Um, but anyways, what was I going for? But anyways, yeah. Like, May 2021.
00:12:48.162 - 00:13:12.964, Speaker A: Like, I woke up and, like, my num. Like, the number, my portfolio was, like, down a lot, right? It's like, oh, but at least, you know, it felt like the band aid was being ripped off, right? It's like, okay, it already happened. Maybe we can bottom and, like, you know, go. Go high from there. But I feel like in the last couple of months or last six months, it's just been a continuous downtrend. And sentiment wise, you know, it's just really, really bad out there, right? Really, really bad out there. And, you know, people tell us, like, hey, like, you know, sell on the way up, buy on the way down.
00:13:12.964 - 00:13:44.146, Speaker A: It's not that easy, right? Like, we don't want to sell on the way up. We don't want to buy on the way down. So I think it's important to, like, have some rules, right? But, you know, it's. Yeah, sentiment is really bad down there, right? Especially, like, for phantom, right? I feel like FTM. I feel like FTM is really in the capitulation slash anger phase, right? I. And, you know, this. This psychology of a market cycle thing, this is kind of a meme, right? I mean, not everything, you know, takes on this route, right? Because this assumes that, you know, we enter a bubble, we dump, and then, you know, there's some disbelief and, like, it recovers.
00:13:44.146 - 00:14:07.810, Speaker A: But, you know, not all markets function like this, but anyways, you know, it's. The sentiment's really bad down there or bad down here. You know, like, yeah, yeah, let's keep moving. Yeah. And also. Also, you know, like, saddle. Saddle finance got exploited on Ethereum on April 30.
00:14:07.810 - 00:14:53.360, Speaker A: On April 30. And, you know, this isn't that big of news, right? I'm just sharing this because, literally, like, I think on April 28, I put some stables on saddle on arbitrum, right? I was like, okay, like, optimize airdrop, right? They're rewarding users. I'm just gonna spam a few transactions on. On Arbitrum and hopefully be eligible for an airdrop. Probably not, but, you know, I might as well try, right? Might as well, like, burn, like, $50 in arbitrum fees across, like, the next couple of weeks, and literally two days later, this thing comes out. I'm like, are you kidding me? Like, did I just, like, lose, like, you know, like, 2% of my portfolio, right? Because I put like 2% of my staples or, you know, 2% of my portfolio, which was denominated in staples in the saddle finance. Luckily, this only affected Ethereum, right? Ethereum, mainnet.
00:14:53.360 - 00:15:35.304, Speaker A: So my arbitram funds were totally fine. But I was like, oh my God, like, this sucks, right? I mean, this is like part of the reason why anchor is so strong, right? Because yes, you can earn like 40% on stables, on like random applications, on phantom, or like whatever, right? But you know, it's not like you're being paid like, let's say 40% in like the native farm token. And if the token dumps, then like, you're essentially earning like 5% API. Like it's, it's Junk. But at least with anchor, we're being paid right in the USD, the principal, and that kind of safety, that kind of reassurance is really, really valuable in this type of market. So, you know, like I mentioned, right, May 1, the APY dropped to from 19.5% to 18% on anchor.
00:15:35.304 - 00:16:15.572, Speaker A: And I can I kind of consider this to be a headwind because, you know, if this went down in May, then it's going to go down in June, it's probably going to go down in July, that 15%. And maybe the narrative around UST is going to weaken a little bit. But if you look at the statistics, it really hasn't slowed down the pace of the lunar burn, right? I mean, Luna circulating supply is at all time lows and there's still a lot of inflows into anchor. And I think it's because in this type of market, we want to be able to earn yield on stable coins paid out in the principle, right. Not just like in some random farm token, but actually in the principle. And yes, we know that this can go down to 16.5% next month, most likely 15% in July, but still.
00:16:15.572 - 00:16:38.920, Speaker A: Right, 15%. Even, even if, even if it is 15%, I think the community, right, the wider community feels relatively safe holding funds on anchor. And, you know, there's been a lot of fud around like this creating a downward spiral. You know, the Ponzi is going to go to zero. I don't really think so. Right. I do think this does hurt the narrative, right? I mean, anchor at 18% is a lot weaker than incorrect, 90.5%.
00:16:38.920 - 00:17:38.726, Speaker A: But I don't really think that money is going to leave anchor because there are switching costs. Because if I leave anchor and enter whatever farm, I have to swap Ust to another stable coin. I have to pay bridging fees, I have to pay gas. I mean, yeah, there are switching costs for leaving anchor. So what I expect is that in the tar ecosystem, if people take profits on Luna, Astro, whatever, you know, USD is going to still go to anchor, right? Whether it's 18 or 15%, I feel like a lot of money will like, you know, be retained in the ecosystem. What might have like what issue of them? The issue that might arise is that, you know, if like USDD launches with 30%, if USN launches like whenever those things launch with like 20, 30% yields, there could be less incremental dollars that enter the terror ecosystem. But I still expect UST to and like the Luna burn to be relatively strong, but it's impossible to forecast, you know, the sentiment of the entire market.
00:17:38.726 - 00:18:56.204, Speaker A: Like would people like feel safe with the lendiness of anchor 18%? Or would people be open to exploring USN 20%, roughly 20% whenever it does launch? USD, 30% launch whenever that does launch. But in this type of market, I do think that yield in stable coins is highly sought for, lots of demand for it. And I do think that these algo stable coins will do well as long as they're backed by billionaires. And I guess the bull case for Luna and USD is that prior to the Inca rates dropping, all of the other terra ecosystem applications had to compete with 19.5% on anchor, right? Because if you're like aperture finance or something and you offer like 25% on stable coins, well like do people want to take on the smart contract risk for an incremental 5%? Maybe not, right? But because anchor rates are going down, maybe that could drive more TVL to other ecosystem applications on terra. I'm just highlighting average finance, I'm not endorsing this, I don't have money in this. But what they're trying to do is create these delta neutral strategies on mirror and you can earn like roughly 30%.
00:18:56.204 - 00:19:28.570, Speaker A: I think these rates are not up to date, but you know, they're backed by investors. But the thing is like mirror, like these, like look at these premiums on mirror, right on the right side. Like, I don't think mirror is functioning the way it's supposed to. So, you know, I don't think, I'm not sure how aputure is gonna pivot the strategy, but yeah, definitely mirror is. Yeah, I don't think that there's that many people trying to build on mirror at this point after astroport launched. So yeah, not so great there. And then the next thing I want to go over.
00:19:28.570 - 00:19:48.220, Speaker A: Okay, we still have some of these topics to cover. Is USDD Tron, right? I mean, Justin sun said he's gonna launch us on May 5. I'm like, okay, like, where the hell is the yield gonna come from? Risk. Risk free, 30%. All right, bro. And I read through this and, like, there's, like, barely any trans. Like, I don't really know what the hell is going on here, right.
00:19:48.220 - 00:20:26.706, Speaker A: It just feels like there's this copying Ust and just making it 30%, you know, to, you know, to do like, a dick measuring contest with do Kwan, right? It's like I'm the. I'm the better billionaire or whatever. But, you know, Chandao, we're gonna raise $10 billion 612 months from now. Okay, Trondao. Basic risk free interest rate to 30%. Like, where is that coming from? There's like, no information. So, you know, I don't want to bet against billionaires, but, like, what the hell, man? Like, where's the yield coming from? Like, my guess is that literally, like, they're just going to mint USD and, like, give it out to people that stake USD similar to anchor.
00:20:26.706 - 00:21:34.590, Speaker A: I feel like they're just going to do the same thing that anchor is going to do or that that anchor did. And, you know, hopefully Justin's. Justin Sun's wallet is a backdrop or, sorry, backstop to whatever bad things that might happen here, right? So, you know, that being said, I kinda end the video with just a farewell message saying, okay, like, yes, like, technically we should be wanting to buy here, right? Because prices are lower, right? Like, if you liked x token at $50 and now it's at $30, like, you know, you'll really like it, right? But obviously, as humans, we can't, like, we can't think like that. Or I guess we should think like that, but, you know, we don't think like that because we are risk averse by nature and, you know, we get scared, right? I mean, it happens, right? Fear and greed, you know, it's a thing. So if you do want to gain additional exposure, right, in the markets, you know, I think the traditional method is like, hey, like, you know, I have some stable coins. I'm going to buy the dip. But I do want to highlight some other strategies that you could do that could mute some volatility and it might help you express your views on the market.
00:21:34.590 - 00:22:34.330, Speaker A: So obviously, tough week. And the first question that you should ask yourself is if I liquidated my entire position, right, my entire portfolio, assuming that there aren't really like tax implications, right? Would I buy back the same percentage of my bags that I hold right now? I think I brought this question up before, but especially in these market conditions, it really helps to rebalance selling your less convicted bags and adding more to your higher conviction bags, or if not higher conviction than maybe safer assets like bitcoin, ether, stablecoins. Because, for example, jewel, I'm sure we all feel a certain way about defi kingdoms jewel. But if you sold, let's say you have 3% in jewel, if you sold everything, if you sold all your jewel into stablecoins, would you buy back? Right. 3% in jewel? And chances are you probably won't because, you know, there's a lot of fud around it, and maybe you're fine, like, dealing with the fud, right? Maybe you think the fud is overload. Fud is overblown. So you're fine, right? But me personally, right, I just, like, felt like if I sold my jewel, I would not buy back.
00:22:34.330 - 00:22:59.636, Speaker A: So, like, why am I holding jewel, right? So, you know, I saw some jewel, and I'm sure this can apply to a lot of, a lot of other portfolios. And the biggest example that I show is Klima. This thing is insane. But anyways, I've had a lot of people saying, like, hey, like, you know, like, can you check out my portfolio? Like, what would you do? And, you know, like, Klima was like, $500, and they're like, I'm down so much already. Like, I don't care. I'm just gonna hold it in case it does something. But you can't really think that.
00:22:59.636 - 00:23:39.760, Speaker A: Think that way, right? Because if you sold your Klima back, then, like, would you buy back? Probably not. Then, like, why are you holding your bags in the first place? I think this question is a good way to get rid of some bias, right? Of, like, wanting to see red number turn into a green number. But if you view every day as a new day, if you view your position every day as a new position, it might help you rebalance, you know? Yeah, it might help you rebalance your portfolio. So that's one. And also, if you do want to buy the dip, right? I'm not saying it's a good idea to buy it up, right? I have no idea. But if you do want to long, there is a way that you could. Yeah, there's a way that you can express certain views.
00:23:39.760 - 00:24:09.788, Speaker A: So what you can do is you can short one coin to buy another coin. So obviously phantom, like, maybe. I mean, I'm not suggesting, like, you know, phantom particular, right to short, but I'm just expressing this, this concept, right? Like, you can replace FTM with one. You can replace FTM with avalanche. That doesn't really matter. Or, or even eth, you can borrow FTM, right on Geist and to buy Luna with, right? So if the market dumps, you know, maybe we, maybe we assume that phantom will dump harder than Luna. In that case, you're actually, like, making money.
00:24:09.788 - 00:25:03.680, Speaker A: Making money, right? Kind of. But if the market pumps, then you might expect Luna to pump harder than FTM, and you're also making money. This is a way that you can, like, mute volatility to the upside and downside, right? Because of course, you know, if Luna pumps, then of course I would much rather have bought Luna with stable coins instead of, like, borrowing FTM. But, you know, this is like, one way that you can kind of express your views on the market, right? And what I did last week, right before the markets nuked a lot harder was, hey, like, I was like, okay, I kinda buy some near, but I don't want to buy it with, like, my stable coins, right? So, you know, I bought some near and to protect or to kind of hedge that. So let's say about like $1,000 with a near. You can do this strategy where you can borrow $2,000 worth of bitcoin, either Avax and buy GLP, right on GMX. And that way you're effectively, you know, you're kind of delta neutral.
00:25:03.680 - 00:25:35.852, Speaker A: You're not really delta neutral, but, you know, you're effectively delta neutral. Right. It's as close as you, you can get. I'm not going to go over GLp, GMX mechanics, right? Just go to my previous videos if you want. But this is the type of stuff that you can do, right, in case you want to buy the dip and you're, like, less bullish, like one particular asset than the other. Right. Maybe this helps because at the end of day, we should be wanting to buy the dip, whatever, right? Like, oh, like, you sold the bottom, but it doesn't really matter, right? At the end of the day, we're just trying to maximize our sleep adjusted returns.
00:25:35.852 - 00:25:58.180, Speaker A: Like, we want to be able to sleep at night. We don't want to wake up in the middle of the night. 04:00 a.m. open queen waco and be like, wow, like, I'm down bad right now. I'm down that. So, yeah, there's that. Yeah, there's not that much else I want to cover in terms of, like, the headwinds and, like, tailwinds, like, obviously the Defi kingdom is, like, this is bad, right? You know, it's gonna take time for it to repair.
00:25:58.180 - 00:26:27.362, Speaker A: You know, like, I don't even know, like, USD 30. Like, where is that coming from? Us. And, like, when is that going to come? You know, as anchor rates go down, maybe that's a tailwind, but maybe I'm underestimating the true demand drive demand factors for anchor, because I still expect, like, a bunch of money to flow into anchor just because, you know, it's been around. There's, like, less smart contract risk. And 80% is still good, 16.5% is still good, 15% still really, really good. Yeah.
00:26:27.362 - 00:27:21.972, Speaker A: So, you know, I still love algo stable coins. You know, I guess to touch on, like, my near position, right? I mean, you know, I feel like I'm always in this, like, tug and pull scenario of, like, when do I say I'm wrong? Like, when do I say I'm wrong? Right. Because, you know, I've had this position on for, like, you know, let's say, like, five months, and it's not doing so well. Right. I kind of ask myself, like, every single day, right? And, you know, like I mentioned, right, with the question of, like, rebalancing your portfolio, it doesn't really matter how much money you're down or up, if you view your position every single day as a new position. Would I still have the same amount of coins? Like x percent in that coin, x percent in that coin? I still feel good about Nier, and I understand that it could be wrong, and I've been wrong in the past five months, and I paid the price. You know, the metrics.
00:27:21.972 - 00:27:42.692, Speaker A: I still like the numbers. I still like, you know, the TBL factor. Right? So let's go. Let's go back to here. TVL inflows have been pretty strong for near. And, you know, TBL is just like one. Like one equation, right? Like, let's just go to what is it? Define right.
00:27:42.692 - 00:28:27.574, Speaker A: Because at the end of the day, TBL doesn't really matter, right? I mean, it's all about value capture. I feel like there's so many people that look at FTM, market cap to TVL, and they're using this to buy the dip and whatnot. But if it hasn't worked in the past six months, is this even the right metric to look at? So TVL doesn't really matter. It's more about what's the value captured token for me. I feel like with USN, whenever that actually launches with yield, the mechanics of USN essentially make it so that you kind of have to buy back near in the open market to arbitrage difference, right, when there's high demand for us. So I'm kind of betting on that. But, you know, as every week passes, right? I mean, like, as sentiment gets worse and worse, there's less risk appetite in the market.
00:28:27.574 - 00:29:07.442, Speaker A: And, you know, it's more and more, it becomes more and more likely that, you know, this position just, like, could get me wrecked. I'm fully aware of that. Right? I'm fully aware of that. Like, I'm not like, you know, just like, oblivious to, like, what's happening with the markets. But, you know, I still like algo stable coins in this environment. I mean, I think anchor Ust, you know, their success is pretty good signal, right? For example, like, I can't look this up right now, but, you know, terra Defi experienced half a billion dollars in inflows on fireblocks, which is like institutional defi. And, you know, if half a billion is flowing into anchor, then I would expect more like stables to flow into near and even tron, too.
00:29:07.442 - 00:30:04.252, Speaker A: Like, I'm not touching Tron, right? Maybe when they're more transparent, I'll touch Tron. But that's kind of how I view things. You know, I'm just trying to be honest, right? I'm just like, you know, I'm just doing the best out here, right? I'm just doing the best out here, you know, taking some risks, right? Because the crypto game, it's all about, like, risk return, right? Like, what's the risk? Like, how much risk am I taking? Like, what's the potential return? And, you know, given those variables, like, okay, like, let's position ourselves. But, you know, you know, this, this year has been, you know, pretty, pretty tough, right? I mean, I'm doing okay. I mean, it's like, you know, but I'm not doing good either. You know, it's, it's like I, as I did this whole time, it's like I expect myself to, you know, significantly outperform bitcoin in ETH because I feel like that's like the basket that, uh, you know, we should be striving to beat, right? And, you know, I am outperforming bitcoin in ETh, but, like, you know, it's not like I'm outperforming it by a significant amount. So, you know, there's, that, there's a market update.
00:30:04.252 - 00:30:11.798, Speaker A: I don't know how long this video has been. It's half an hour. God. Okay. Okay. I think I covered everything. Let me check, actually.
00:30:11.798 - 00:30:23.358, Speaker A: Let's see. Let's see. I think that's everything, right? I think that's everything. Okay. Justin sun. Like, what are you planning here, buddy? Like, come on. His excellency, Justin sun.
00:30:23.358 - 00:30:37.282, Speaker A: All right. Like, you know, we'll see how it goes. Thank you, guys. Watching. Have a phone out there and let me know where your thoughts are on, you know, just anything I cover. And I'll see you next week, probably on Monday for the next market update. Bye.
