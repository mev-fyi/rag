00:00:00.880 - 00:00:11.254, Speaker A: All right, now we're live. It's gonna be a good one. It's gonna be a good one, right?
00:00:11.422 - 00:00:12.370, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:00:13.270 - 00:00:15.530, Speaker A: All right, let me just post this in a few places.
00:00:19.070 - 00:00:21.534, Speaker C: Wow. Already 190 watching, man.
00:00:21.702 - 00:00:43.624, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. There's, like, a huge discrepancy between, like, YouTube and Twitter when it comes to, like, Twitter communities. I feel like Twitter is mostly full of, like, eth Solana and, like, bitcoin. Maxis. Maybe not Maxis, but, like, just, like, really passionate folks, whereas YouTube, I feel, like, has more, I guess, Cardano and, like, those other chains. All right, all right.
00:00:43.624 - 00:00:50.864, Speaker A: We can talk about that, too. Yeah. I do want to talk about Cardano later, too, because I have my own thesis on, like, what's going to happen over there.
00:00:51.032 - 00:01:01.800, Speaker B: I like talking about things that make people uncomfortable because as my handle goes, captain rational, there's quite an interesting thing to talk about Cardano as well as hex.
00:01:02.620 - 00:01:06.124, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Let's go then. I'm about it.
00:01:06.252 - 00:01:18.000, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyways, yeah. People are awesome. Is everyone. Is the audio fine chat? Messi's here. Everyone's saying.
00:01:21.020 - 00:01:23.694, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see. We'll see how hype I get, guys.
00:01:23.892 - 00:01:56.522, Speaker A: As a historical show. All right, so I know as people are rolling in, I just want to just give a brief introduction to both of you. I had no on my channel, and I think Messi, like, when I was first entering crypto, I was, like, looking for people to follow, like, influencers. And Messi was one of the people that I thought was really knowledgeable. Really, like, those threads you put out I watched at Coin church, like, back in the day when I was, like, buying things on Coinbase, not knowing the tokenomics of these things. So, actually, let's start with Nessie. So how long have you been in crypto, and how has your strategy changed over the years?
00:01:56.706 - 00:02:34.404, Speaker C: Well, so I first got into crypto December of 2013, and I got into crypto because I was a loser and my wife was not. My current wife was not. At the time, she was straight a student, had everything going for her. And I was just kind of thinking to myself, if I don't. If I don't figure out a way to, you know, to be a provider, if I don't figure out a way to be somebody, then, you know, she's gone. Like, why would she be with me? Like, she's great. So I actually started researching online, you know, how to get rich online, literally.
00:02:34.404 - 00:02:53.360, Speaker C: That's what I was typing into Google. And, you know, I found out about dogecoin, and I'd always been a degenerate. I mean, I didn't have a pot to piss in. You know, I grew up very wealthy, but, you know, my parents had pretty much just said, like, hey, you suck, you know, like, we're cutting you off. You know, you need to grow the fuck up. Or can I curse on your stream, you know, before?
00:02:53.440 - 00:02:53.872, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:53.936 - 00:02:54.192, Speaker C: Okay.
00:02:54.216 - 00:02:55.904, Speaker A: I just want to unfiltered. Unfiltered.
00:02:55.952 - 00:03:16.840, Speaker C: Yeah. I've got. I've been known to have a potty mouth, so I just want to make sure I don't need to be, you know, cognizant of that. But anyway, you know, I'd always been a degenerate. You know, I didn't have a pot to piss on. Just smoking weed and drinking and partying with friends and shit, you know, and, you know, other things, too. And one thing that was always very important to me was having.
00:03:16.840 - 00:03:58.780, Speaker C: Building my own gaming PC that's always, like, every. I got my first desktop, and I was, like, five years old, like, compact presario with, like, a 300 MHz processor. Like, I've been fascinated with computers ever since. And I had a pretty badass setup. I worked all summer, and, you know, I had a great gpu and all that. So, you know, I found out about Dogecoin and I started mining it, my computer, instead of playing computer games. And I didn't know it at the time, but that moment was literally, like, probably the biggest inflection point of my entire life because I came to find a place where I fit in really well.
00:03:58.780 - 00:04:37.626, Speaker C: People that were like minded, people that were just fucking nerds like me, and we started having a lot of fun. I was mining Dogecoin originally with the goal of getting another GPU. I think at the time, there was the ATI 280 X. That was the big boy GPU. I had the shitty $100 ones from Best Buy, but it just became something I was very passionate about, staying up for these launches and all that. Eventually, over time, I graduated from college with a computer science degree, and this became my job, uh, full time, which was. It's funny, it's.
00:04:37.626 - 00:04:58.082, Speaker C: It's literally I'm living. Living the dream, and the universe just kind of steered me down this path. So in terms of, you know, how my strategy's evolved over time. You know, your strategy evolves with the climate, you know, with. With the amount of size you have. I didn't. I didn't have shit in crypto until 2017.
00:04:58.082 - 00:05:21.970, Speaker C: You know, I'm talking probably less than $10,000, but the landscape continues to evolve and change. So I think the best strategy is just to be fluid and to see what's hype right now and to keep your ears to the ground, make connections and try to determine what the newest trends are going to be and where the money is so you can extract that.
00:05:23.470 - 00:05:32.400, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Thanks for the story. How about you? How about, you know, like, when did you get into crypto? And, like, how has your strategy evolved over the years?
00:05:33.380 - 00:05:59.860, Speaker B: I'm old. I've been in this shit for too long. So 2016, I believe. I paid Genesis mining to mine dash for me at the time, and then Dash was being accumulated. That was like $2. And then, you know, 17 and 18 rolled in and dash ripped to $1,000. So that was spectacular.
00:05:59.860 - 00:06:26.940, Speaker B: I was living in Orlando at the time. I was working at Universal Studios. I'm a software engineer. I write Android apps for a living and amongst other things, diversified. So I was living in an apartment in Orlando, and I ended up building up about 13 gpu's. And these were 1080 tis at the time, top of the line hardware. So I was mining Digibyte.
00:06:26.940 - 00:07:02.902, Speaker B: That was interesting. That was a very exorbitant lucrative. It was just rolling in just so many coins. And that was my old school experience with Utxo is my narrative, my stories, my ideology have evolved into a whole nother level at this point. And I didn't get into financials, really understanding the financial aspect of what we do probably until, like, late 2019. And, you know, we could get into that as we talk about what's going on with avalanche. But my narrative has evolved significantly over the years.
00:07:02.902 - 00:07:32.170, Speaker B: Probably back when. When I first got involved, I was younger, I had very different mentality. And as Messi says, it was probably about 1015 grand at most, deployed at any given time. Between bitcoin and a variety of smaller assets, that was a heck of a season, 17 and 18. Nowadays, these are financial markets. These are financial systems. We did not have what we have now back then.
00:07:32.170 - 00:07:42.370, Speaker B: These are when we talk about avalanche boys, we're talking about the birthing of a financial market for a variety of reasons and fundamentals that I could talk about.
00:07:42.950 - 00:08:22.988, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of bullish things I can say about avalanche, but, yeah, thanks for your story. So, I mean, this is my channel, so I'm not going to go over too much in detail, like what my story is, but to those that don't know, like, I got into crypto last year, actually, I played poker professionally. There's a lot of poker players in crypto, but I was low key, like bitcoin Maxi last year just because, I mean, I bought it in August, and this is what kept going up. And in January, I opened up my eyes to Ethereum and decentralized finance, and I didn't really know what I was doing. I was buying farm tokens, and they were going up. So I was so happy. Obviously, farm coins always end up going down and whatnot.
00:08:22.988 - 00:08:55.770, Speaker A: And when Polygon launched in April, I knew that, hey, they're launching $100 million in liquidity mining. Time to farm the fuck out of this ecosystem. And ever since then, I carved out a niche for myself in farming. And then identifying momentum shifts to the markets. So identifying polygon, terra, and avalanche. So now this panel is like, people that have different strategies around the avalanche ecosystem. So I think Noah has the more humble strategy, whereas Messi takes on more risk.
00:08:55.770 - 00:09:08.030, Speaker A: Obviously, I'm taking on risk as well. But Messi, let's start with you. What's currently your avalanche strategy right now, and how did you, like, discover avalanche and, like, what are your plans for it?
00:09:08.190 - 00:09:30.050, Speaker C: All right, so I actually discovered avalanche. You know, I heard about it a long time ago, you know, but it was kind of just, like, mentioned among, like, a lot of noise going on. You know, I didn't initially come over. I didn't initially try to bridge or anything like that. And then I remember, I don't even know, to be honest. I barely remember anything from the last week. I was so sleep deprived.
00:09:30.050 - 00:10:10.970, Speaker C: It was just one of those situations. I mean, I had to go tell my wife, like, hey, like, I'm sorry for neglecting you for this week, but I feel like this is going to be, like, all hands on deck. Like, I have to be on this because it's so important that I capture this moment for us. And she understands that kind of thing. The idea here is that eventually we just get to hang out and spend time together, and everything's on autopilot. But I still remember I was dming you and we were talking about defi stuff and catalysts, arbitrum. And I think you had reached out to me and you'd said, hey, you understand that arbitrum is coming out with training wheels on it.
00:10:10.970 - 00:10:42.936, Speaker C: Essentially, there's limits on the amount of transactions per day. It's brand new technology. They're not going to just release it balls to the wall and just see what happens. They're trying to be very careful about it. And you said something about the avalanche ecosystem, and I'm a stubborn son of a bitch. So at first when you said that I was like, whatever. And then I saw a post on Twitter the next day about this liquidity mining program that's coming to avalanche.
00:10:42.936 - 00:11:32.506, Speaker C: And I started thinking to myself, well, that same liquidity mining program was a major catalyst for Matic, was a major catalyst for binance smart chain. And I think binance smart chain was more developer incentives, which is smart too. And I was thinking, my defi bags, like the charts, look good, but there's really no momentum in Ethereum defi right now for obvious reasons. A, nfts are all the rage, and b, it's just too expensive to do Defi on Ethereum. So I just made the decision and I deployed pretty large, but I should have deployed larger in retrospect. Retrospect's always a bitch. I said, you know, you're never going to forgive yourself if the same thing that happens on matic and BSc happens on avalanche, and you're not.
00:11:32.506 - 00:12:03.228, Speaker C: And you're aware of this opportunity and you don't front run other people's awareness. So I decided to come on over and I use this bridge. And the technology behind the bridge is actually incredible. It uses secure enclaves and Intel Sgx. Granted, there's still a lot of battle testing and hardening that needs to happen on this bridge. It is new technology, but the bridge is really nice. The experience getting over there was really easy.
00:12:03.228 - 00:13:02.820, Speaker C: And after bridging and making my first transaction, I was just like, holy shit, I'm onto something here. And other people are going to have that same kind of emotion when they do it. So my strategy right now, I think a lot of the early repricing of things has already occurred. I'm watching bridge flows, because the bridge flows on the primary bridge, I think are a good indication of new money entering the ecosystem, which is important when you're looking at these hypergrowth characteristics, because there's really ten good projects to buy. So if you have large flows on the bridge, you have to assume that, hey, this new money is going to be hitting these projects that I'm in. So you can expect further upside, you can expect the dips to get bought. But if momentum stalls, then it might become a more interesting thing to do until those inflows pick back up.
00:13:02.820 - 00:14:40.326, Speaker C: To be a farmer and try to capitalize on some of these high apys and stuff. We're blessed in this ecosystem and that we have auto compounders and things like that for us to maximize our returns in the meantime. But kind of some external factors that haven't really been thrown into this thesis yet are both the seller and the nerve finance bridges, which is really interesting because if you think about binance smart chain and the growth of binance smart chain, obviously there's the argument to be made that how is the avalanche ecosystem going to have the same kind of explosive growth as, let's say, the Solana ecosystem or the binance smart chain ecosystems, when if you really think about what the main bridges were to those ecosystems, at least in the beginning, it was the actual centralized exchanges themselves. Binance, the entity, the exchange was the original best bridge and a lot of capital able to be bridged over to the binance smart chain ecosystem. But the thing is, is that people are very familiarized with EVM now. There's a lot of retail participants that love the EVM game, that have already been onboarded to EVM, that have made money in EVM, that are looking for the next hype, looking for the next big thing. So the way I'm looking at this is when you have efficient bridging technology from binance smart chain and matic over to the avalanche ecosystem, it removes the actual requirement to have this centralized intermediary, like a binance or an FTX, to get people over here.
00:14:40.326 - 00:15:10.510, Speaker C: It just takes these people coming over and then they're just good to go. It's the same experience that they already love, that they've already been familiarized with. So the synapse bridge, and that's nerve finance just went live today. I believe that's probably the highest quality bridge that we have at the moment between these different ecosystems. So it'll be interesting to watch watch flows on that bridge if there is anywhere to watch to see if these retail participants are bridging over and taking advantage of these opportunities.
00:15:11.330 - 00:15:38.378, Speaker A: Yeah, bridging is really important. I mean, when I bridged over from Polygon to avalanche, it was kind of a pain in the ass. I had to wait an hour from matic to ethereum, and I was like, oh my God, I need to buy avalanche right now, but I can't because my funds are fucking stuck in this shit. And then, like, from Ethereum, avalanche, the bridge is, like insane. Like, like, once you bridge, I feel like it's like really hard to bridge back just because the experience is so nice. It's like $5 to bridge. It's amazing.
00:15:38.378 - 00:16:04.206, Speaker A: And, yeah, like, like you mentioned earlier, like, hindsight's a bitch, right? It's just like, I was early. I was earlier than most people on avalanche, but I feel like I played it pretty poorly. I mean, I kind of loaded up on Avax and PNG, just because I thought those would do well. And, I mean, I made money on them, obviously, and they did do well, but I missed out on Joe. Like, I'm still coping, and I had access to the teams too. Like, I talked to the teams, and I was like. But I was like, you know what? Like, I'll just be humble.
00:16:04.206 - 00:16:21.422, Speaker A: Stack avax, stack png, and then, you know, apes just outperform me. It's like, ah, it is what it is. And speaking of which, noah, I think you also have a pretty good, interesting story on, like, what your strategy on avalanche is. I heard you, like, bridged today or yesterday, and, like, what are you doing with your funds now?
00:16:21.526 - 00:16:24.920, Speaker B: What's your strategy weeks ago? Just to play around, really.
00:16:24.960 - 00:16:25.480, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:25.600 - 00:16:51.976, Speaker B: It's the same thing as Polygon, obviously, a different fundamental technology. I've been familiar with Avalanche for a while because of blocknet. I've had blocknet service nodes for a long time. I mean, it's years dating back to, like, 2017, 2018. So when blocknet. So avalanche has been on my radar because of blocknet. But what catches my fancy is exactly what Messi is talking about is capital flows.
00:16:51.976 - 00:18:07.562, Speaker B: And I look at these networks as financial assistance, and there's critical components to financial systems, and the precursor to all this was BSE, and no one saw BSc coming. But when I saw Polygon and we saw that Aave and curve are going to deploy, I realized why BSC did what it did, and that's because it has the characteristics, components, and the technology, the fundamental tool set required for a financial system to function accordingly. Its debt positions, and it's liquidity, and it's a capacity for transactions to occur and leverage to be taken and opportunities to be had. So that's exactly where we're at with avalanche. The precursor is set, and the second you top it off with 180 mil worth of incentives, the amount of capital flow, the second aave and curve launch, because those are the safe protocols time tested, mother approved. Who's not going to throw five mil into AavE and just get incentivized yield? Where you borrow 20% tether, you roll it over back into Aave position, and that's exactly what played out in polygon. You're going to be farming the incentivized returns on AAvE.
00:18:07.562 - 00:18:54.580, Speaker B: So these are relatively risk minimized plays, and that's just free gains. And dare. You take those borrowed stablecoin debt positions, and you throw it on the curve. Now you got your base APY, plus your incentivized returns, and now you're up in the. Your overall returns for me, my pension or my interest nowadays is relatively risk moderate. I wouldn't say risk minimized, because I do have my interest in outperforming, but it's isolated the small parts of my portfolio. So, with regard to that aspect of my portfolio, why? Because it gives you your returns.
00:18:54.580 - 00:19:45.462, Speaker B: The transaction fees are used to produce a disinflationary pressure, a constant buy pressure on the asset, which is very significant with regard to long term valuation of the asset. And two, it's going to outperform as the capital inflow occurs. So bez Messi is watching the capital flow across the bridges and nerves coming online wherever binance smart chain capital could flow over, and Polygon capital could flow over, and that this is where the exuberance is occurring, that this is the time, this is a good time. Hop protocol has been on my eye as well. That's probably gone back to Ethereum and vice versa. These are great places, the bridges. These non primary bridges are great place to deploy capital.
00:19:45.462 - 00:19:53.980, Speaker B: I mean, you literally getting free capital on stable coins. Thats basically a savings account. Its basically a money market account.
00:19:55.840 - 00:20:21.968, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like when it comes to capital inflows into BSc, polygon, then avalanche. I feel like, me personally, my friends were in binance smart chain in January, and I was coping when everythings they all ten x their portfolio. So when I saw Polygon, im like, okay, im going to eat this shit, right? I just know what's going to happen, and I feel like, messi. I think you missed out on BSc and Polygon, and now you're like, okay, I see avalanche miles away. I hate this shit.
00:20:22.024 - 00:20:49.240, Speaker C: The funny thing about BSc is, I was actually one of the first people on Binance smart chain. And I had that same kind of revelation the second I got over there. That, holy shit. Why would I use Ethereum when this is so fast and so cheap? It makes everything so much fun. Because I can make decisions very fast, I can execute on those decisions, and then I can say, oh, shit, I shouldn't have done that. And then just reverse it. And it doesn't mean anything because it doesnt cost any money.
00:20:49.240 - 00:21:39.172, Speaker C: The unfortunate thing for me was we got the news that Binance was really getting rid of us people. And binance, the centralized exchange at the time, and I didnt foresee how big binance smart chain would come. Thats the disclaimer when Binance said, at the time, hey, were getting rid of all us people. I had a shit ton of BNB at like, $30, a significant portion of my portfolio. I had significant BSc exposure. And for me, at that moment, I said, damn it, like, this is great, but I got to get out of here, because it doesn't matter how well I do over here, if I have no way to actually get out, it doesn't mean anything. Unfortunately, I didn't have the vision to see that, hey, this is going to become huge, and there's going to be ways for me to bridge out eventually down the road.
00:21:39.172 - 00:22:16.290, Speaker C: So I actually left right before all of the fun and got back into Ethereum Defi. I can't really complain. Ethereum defi did run between, depending on what you were in, you ran anywhere from probably 510 x in a very short period of time, January to February. But after that, you see, Ethereum Defi stalled out and stabilized, and the whales farmed that, and all of the apes went to binance smart chain. And of course, we saw things over there that were borderline absurdity, pancakeswap, doing 100 x in a very short period of time, et cetera, et cetera.
00:22:17.150 - 00:22:36.510, Speaker A: Yeah, it was insane. And yeah, I had a similar story I tried to bridge on, but I couldn't do it from binance us. And I had to VPN to use the Binance bridge, and I was like, okay, I don't think they're going to hit that critical mass liquidity. Obviously, I was wrong, and that gave me the conviction polygon. I'm eight.
00:22:36.970 - 00:23:10.052, Speaker B: I'm going mass liquidity. That is an extraordinary phrase. And as much as avalanche is just getting started, eyes peeled, because that is everything. Once you have an influx of liquidity, that means market actors have a capacity to borrow debt, which means there's debt interest payments, which means there's leverage, which means there's borrowed debt being used as liquidity and stablecoin positions. And that's the fundamental requirement for the birthing of a financial system, in my opinion.
00:23:10.156 - 00:23:43.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I love money markets, and, yeah, I think money markets are the most important, like, primitive to have in an ecosystem for it to thrive. Right? Like, we saw Benki launch, and then TVL went from 200 million to a billion in a day. It was absolutely insane. I'm just gonna share my screen here because I have some things that I want to show. So, like, on August 23, we have $2 billion of liquidity right into avalanche. And then five days later, on the 28th, we hit $3 billion. And Messi, you mentioned earlier something about arbitrum, right? It's like arbitrum.
00:23:43.574 - 00:23:51.558, Speaker A: They're supposed to launch August 2021 and people are excited, right? Like EtH Maxis, like they're like super excited. Like this is going to be excited with good reason.
00:23:51.614 - 00:23:55.730, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Arbitrum is awesome. Like don't get me wrong, you know?
00:23:56.220 - 00:23:56.596, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:56.628 - 00:24:23.352, Speaker A: Like technology wise it's amazing, right. But in the short term, it's like it's going to be unusable, right, because they're going to have speed bumps. They're going to place initial limits on the volume activity and we will gradually raise these limits over time. So it's similar to, it's similar to optimism. Like arbitrum isn't going to allow the apes to flourish. It's going to have training wheels. And I think in the short term, like ETH Defi is going to underperform significantly compared to Solana, compared to Luna, compared to avalanche.
00:24:23.352 - 00:24:40.860, Speaker A: And thats been my thesis all along. And I think I heard you mention this in other live streams, too. But I believe ETH L2 in 2021 isnt arbitrary optimism. Its avalanche, right? Because I think were all bullish Ethereum in the long term, but in the short term, its not ready and theres going to be lots of copium.
00:24:42.760 - 00:25:21.010, Speaker C: And even then youve got the situation where we have right now two main front runners for Ethereum, L2. That being arbitrary optimism. There's also some interesting ZK technology that's going to be launching down the road that facilitates that as well. But even then, it's lacking a few things that avalanche can provide. Right now, you have an issue with a fragmentation of liquidity because you do have these two things that are trying to capture growth at the same time. Defi is all about composability. All of these systems being able to compose and interact with each other.
00:25:21.010 - 00:26:26.368, Speaker C: You don't have that issue on avalanche at all. And then, you know, the bridging itself is very important as well. You know, if I bridged over to arbitrum or optimism, you know, there's these withdrawal delays and people don't like having to wait a week to have access to your capital, you know, to take your capital away from somewhere. So I think that coupled with the fact that we have these incentives coming online for the avalanche ecosystem very clearly demonstrates who the clear momentum winner is going to be in the coming months. And I don't know how long the mania lasts. Is this going to go on for a month? Is it going to go on for two months? But I do know that people love EVM Defi, and I do know that avalanche is actually the first opportunity to have a decentralized hyperscalable EVM DeFi system. So I'm curious right now to see long term how this plays out as well.
00:26:26.544 - 00:27:07.504, Speaker B: You got to remember that there's not necessarily an end, and that's what I'm trying to retrain the way I think about things. For instance, I've recently posted, my primary focus is cross chain protocols. Protocols that transcend any specific chain. I mean, spell spells going and mim, they're going over to avalanche. And there's any of these assets, even fracs as a stable coin, it just goes over the bridge. It's just an ERC 20 that's put in a lock and there's a tokenized representation minted on some other EVM compatible chain. So I very much see at some point in the future a blurring of the lines.
00:27:07.504 - 00:27:36.558, Speaker B: Does it matter what chain you're on? Sure. With regard to transaction fees, that is a consideration, but the line will get blurred. And in the short term, the capital inflow into avalanche is a no brainer. We have the precursors, the foreshadow, as I like to say. We saw what would happen with Polygon. We saw what happened with binance smart chain. The same capital inflow will occur on avalanche for the exact same reasons.
00:27:36.558 - 00:27:44.166, Speaker B: The opportunity cost on other chains is there. And the opportunity is available on avalanche.
00:27:44.318 - 00:28:27.872, Speaker A: Yeah. And yeah, it's just that there's so much opportunity cost, right? Like just being in Ethereum based Defi right now, at least in my opinion, even like when I first bridged funds over to avalanche, like, I bridged over like, bitcoin link, Ethereum and Chainlink. And then like a few days ago, I was like, why am I holding Chainlink? I guess you just buy more avax. And I'm like, slowly increasing exposure to avalanche just because I know what's going to happen. We saw this with Polygon and I think there's going to be something larger with avalanche. And I feel like people, I feel like a lot of people in the comment section on Twitter, YouTube, people think that they're late, but they're not late at all. I mean, Abby is going to bring on eight to $10 billion worth of liquidity.
00:28:27.872 - 00:28:59.514, Speaker A: At least that's my relatively conservative estimate. And curve is going to be instantly pivotal because what curve allows for is for the repegging of assets. Because right now on pangolin, theres zero liquidity for USDC. And right now the only stable coins are USdT and dai. And people obviously are less comfortable with tether or dai compared to USDC. And if youre trying to swap USDC. Even in 100k, you're going to incur 28% slippage.
00:28:59.514 - 00:29:34.652, Speaker A: And curve is going to fix that because curve will allow for USDC die tethered pools for less liquidity. And I'm sure there are a bunch of people that are more than happy to bridge over more USDC to avalanche when the time comes. And also Benki announced that the USDC market will go live tomorrow. Liquidity mining programs here, the rates for the other ones will go down a little bit, but this should bring on more liquidity actually, because I think us, I mean, tether obviously has the highest market cap, stablecoin, but there's a lot of people with USDC that.
00:29:34.676 - 00:30:24.144, Speaker C: Mike, I say there's two things that I'm looking forward to the most right now in avalanche. One that is the curve launch. We have to have that deep stablecoin liquidity. And another critical component that I assume will launch at some point is an efficient aggregator, you know, to where we can aggregate all of this liquidity on avalanche, you know, it's an absolute must. Right now. One of my favorite projects, Yieldiac, has not an aggregator, but has a swap function that allows you to route multi exchange, but it doesn't have the ability to actually partial fill and split orders, you know. So I'm really looking forward to seeing, you know, hopefully a one inch or somebody big, you know, that's already developed these technologies, come over here and give us the ability to have that liquidity.
00:30:24.192 - 00:30:44.380, Speaker B: Aggregation clay, that was a joy on polygon when one inch picked it up and it broke down the transactions very nicely and it was just basically free transactions. When you do it on Ethereum and you got a dollar 300 transaction, you pause for a second, you're like, all right, I'm going to check out and see what the prices are in uniswap.
00:30:44.800 - 00:30:46.380, Speaker C: Yeah, no, 100%.
00:30:47.680 - 00:31:18.862, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, let me screen share something that I think Messi mentioned earlier too. Maybe it was before the stream, but generally in the past couple of weeks, the bridging, there's been more deposits than withdrawals. But today's like the first red day, right, where the net, I mean the day just started, but there are now more withdrawals away from avalanche than deposits to the avalanche blockchain. So like Messi, like, are you worried about this or is this just like a single day anomaly that you're not really worried about?
00:31:19.046 - 00:32:16.056, Speaker C: Because I know I'm not worried about it and let me just explain why. And I also want to add a disclaimer to something I've been saying. When I say that we are early, I don't want that to be misinterpreted as I need to be going all in on these things right now, after they've run as hard as they have. You know, when I say that we're early and we're talking about early in the sense that we don't have this deep liquidity, we don't have aggregators, we don't have a great block explorer yet, we don't have tools like NansEn yet. There's so much that is coming and so many new projects that will launch that will be innovative. So when I say that we're early and that we're by participating now, by getting in now, you are front running billions in inflows. That statement still stands true 100%, but that doesn't mean that it's up only there will be corrections.
00:32:16.056 - 00:33:36.410, Speaker C: There's a lot of people, especially people that have been believers in this ecosystem for much longer than anyone here, that have probably made significant sums of money. There's going to be road bumps along the way. Just keep that in mind and know that the best way to play this is to think not, hey, what can I bridge over, invest in, and double my money on tomorrow? But more, how can I operate efficiently in this ecosystem knowing everything that's coming, knowing the billions of flows are going to be arriving, knowing that deeper liquidity is going to be arriving, how can I operate in that environment, protect myself from downside and also capture the upside? You have to remember that the rotation game in this ecosystem hasn't even started yet, because we don't have projects to rotate into. There's not these new things yet. So protect your downside and be very mindful of that. And also, I do think at some point in time, Avalanche is going to outperform the altcoins that are there significantly. So I also have significant Avax exposure just because I've been up in USD too many times in my life to let that happen again.
00:33:36.410 - 00:34:21.190, Speaker C: If Avax does run significantly, it's the same situation that happened to BSC will actually happen in this ecosystem, because all of the liquidity is versus Avax. You know when that happens, if Avax goes to $150, which I think is inevitable, you have to remember that the total value locked in this ecosystem could increase two or three fold alongside with that. So just something to be mindful of, protect yourselves and wait for the opportunities to present themselves, because there's no need to be rushing and fomoing right now. You're so early that if you put your ear to the ground and you wait for those opportunities, there's so many easy multiples to come.
00:34:22.370 - 00:35:15.210, Speaker A: Yeah. And I feel like, I feel like we already had this watershed moment where like a rising tie lifts all boats. Like literally everything in the avalanche ecosystem like went up so much, right? I mean, yak went from like a thousand to like 15,000. Whatever, Joe, obviously outperforming everything else. And one thing that I do when like, my audience to know, and I think this is going to be useful for YouTube Messi, is that I often compare the polygon ecosystem to, sorry, the avalanche ecosystem to the polygon ecosystem. And that's how I drew my parallels with, like, you know, why I bought Avax and why I bought PNg initially. And you mentioned like the rotation game, like back to quality, mainly the native token, like Avax, if you use polygon as a case study, the quickswap token, right? Which was the largest, I guess, market cap coin on polygon, it peaked on April 30, right? Messi, do you want to guess when polygon peaked? That.
00:35:18.350 - 00:35:22.170, Speaker C: That was sometime maybe at the end of May.
00:35:22.630 - 00:36:08.162, Speaker A: Yeah. So polygon peaked on May 18 and polygon on April 30 when. When quickswap peaked was at then at like three and a half x, right. So if I use this as a case study, then I think it's more likely that these farm tokens or these altcoins will peak before Avax. And there's going to be a capital, I guess, like a flight to safety, as you might say, to the Avax token. And this is why, I mean, even though I've underperformed the majority of the Avax apes, I still hold more Avax than I do any other token. I do think this is going to happen where people will rush into avalanche ecosystem and there's just going to be some crazy bubble in the Avax token.
00:36:08.162 - 00:36:18.870, Speaker A: So that's how I'll be playing it. I'll probably be taking profits, if I do take profits back to Avax and stablecoins and just farming with it once curve launches.
00:36:20.170 - 00:36:21.282, Speaker C: Go ahead, Noah.
00:36:21.466 - 00:37:02.540, Speaker B: I'd like to know the supply versus emissions versus disinflation. That's what I want to dig into. So polygon is matic is just inflationary. Ethereum has its new disinflationary component, but avalanche transaction fees are fully burnt. I wonder what the emissions compared to the disinflationary pressure are. This makes a very significant difference. That is a very significant different property as compared to what happened with polygon, especially BSc disinflation is a strong price appreciative force with regard to supply and demand pressures.
00:37:03.720 - 00:37:55.330, Speaker C: And you have to remember just that. Disinflation component increases substantially with transactional velocity. With all of these things coming to avalanche and with the throughput capabilities of this ecosystem, we could see some crazy numbers at some point. One website that I really like, token terminal. I'm sure if you guys are defi guys, hardcore defi guys at all, and you like looking at the kind of things Noah was discussing, you've used token terminal, they've just added avalanche. So that's a good place to watch exactly how much of that is occurring. Part of my thesis moving forward is you have to remember that even really solid projects like Joe, the Joe token is a farm token, these projects are inflating.
00:37:55.330 - 00:38:59.230, Speaker C: And the thing is they can afford to do that. Thats one of the reasons why I think that projects like Joe and like Pangolin are going to be more successful than Ethereum defi that comes over to the avalanche ecosystem because these projects like Sushi cant necessarily afford afford to give out the amount of incentives that Joe can because theres not as many people that are super hype to get on that sushi train right now. So holding moving forward, my thesis is that hey, maybe the momentum on these shitcoins is stalled a little bit because we dont have a lot of new launches, we dont have a lot of new projects coming on. Ive positioned myself largely. This is the disclaimer before I say this, and to Yak and also to avalanche. And the reason being is that Yak is non inflationary and that yak catches tailwinds from literally everything that's about to hit this ecosystem. So I'm seeing it as something that more is able to capture that performance.
00:38:59.230 - 00:39:30.850, Speaker C: And if we do have an avax bubble where avax does go to 100, 5200, whatever, yak won't suffer too much in the sense that it's not being farmed into the dirt by these auto compounders. Just something to remember. A lot of these tokens are inflationary. And with these inflationary tokens that are distributing a lot of incentives, there is a lot of incentive to farm those as well. So at a certain point those are going to become underperformers.
00:39:31.440 - 00:39:52.980, Speaker A: I totally agree. My portfolio is number one, avalanche and number two. Yeah right. For the same reasons. And I guess one of the mistakes that I made with playing the avalanche ecosystem is like I chose PNG over Joe as the winner just because I just. Yeah, I thought the incumbent would win because it always had one. And it seems more and more likely that Joe is going to win over.
00:39:52.980 - 00:40:01.594, Speaker A: But the thing is, sushi is coming over to avalanche. I don't think sushi, sushi's been here.
00:40:01.762 - 00:40:04.330, Speaker C: Is the thing with liquidity mining, though.
00:40:04.450 - 00:40:06.110, Speaker A: Sure, sure. Yeah.
00:40:06.490 - 00:40:08.850, Speaker C: Would you go ahead.
00:40:09.010 - 00:40:29.020, Speaker B: It'll pull some just like it did with over on polygon. It pulled some lulu over a fair amount of liquidity off of quick, quick swap. But did you make good points? They're massive, so they don't have a capacity to throw around the amount of inflationary incentives as the other protocols.
00:40:29.600 - 00:41:34.804, Speaker C: So one thing, of course, I was wrong as well about the p and G Joe dynamic. And I bet very big on PNG, mainly because of the deep liquidity on that token. I thought that, hey, maybe I can roll into PNG and use that as a compounding opportunity where I'm able to exit with sufficient liquidity and minimal slippage. Two things that I think here are important to note. One, Joe has flipped pangolin value locks by a wider margin than people realize, because half the value lock on pangolin is the native token itself, which more gives Joe the hypergrowth exchange characteristics. And it more makes pangolin a farm, you know, having that extremely deep liquidity on that token available for people to come in and farm and take advantage of. So I do think that Joe continues to outperform pangolin, and maybe I'm totally wrong about that.
00:41:34.804 - 00:42:12.198, Speaker C: But the user interface, and the thing that disappoints me about pangolin exchange the most is these guys are major income. They've been here for a very long time. They've had every opportunity in the world to innovate, to do something new, to do something exciting. And if you've used Joe versus pangolin, the user interface is just miles, miles better. People don't want that same uniswap v two interface that we were using back in Defi summer. We've had a long term, a long time to improve on this. We've had a long time to make it better.
00:42:12.198 - 00:42:47.070, Speaker C: And Joe is not just an amm. So it also has that one two punch characteristic of we're going to be, I think they're forking cream with the cream team's blessing and launching that very, very soon. So they're going to be a hub for lending and borrowing and trading. And the interesting thing about that, when you have all of those things under one umbrella, is that I would imagine it also sets up an interesting environment for leveraged farming and leveraged trading. So just a couple of things to think about.
00:42:47.230 - 00:43:31.400, Speaker B: If they do that and they have a debt market, and if theyre that interested in what cream has done, and they go as far as ice cream combined with their open market for free market buybacks with ex Joe transaction fees, buying Joe in the open market, that is a heck of a one two punch. That's more than enough reason for it to outperform the incumbents as well as competition, because that's innovative and in many regards, even compared to l one, our l one ecosystem.
00:43:31.740 - 00:44:25.920, Speaker C: Another thing to remember here is that Joe has an actual allocation for VC investment. And when VC's are able to come in and get those good deals on things like Joe with some kind of investing schedule, then all of a sudden we have aligned interest between developers and money, real big boy money as well. So I think that could be part of the reason why we're seeing Joe outpace Pangolin. You're seeing Alameda, which if you track their wallets at all, deposits significant liquidity into the Joe ecosystem and nothing has been announced. And I don't know anything, full disclaimer. But with all of these things and these little hints, I wouldn't be surprised to see that, you know, the VC's jumped on Team Joe. They see that Joe with deep liquidity, and Joe is going to be the winner here.
00:44:27.260 - 00:44:41.748, Speaker A: Yeah. And yeah, I agree. Like PNG, I think their team kind of fucked up. Like they had all, they had so much time to prepare for this moment, but I mean, they just lost the joke, right? And I guess you go for it.
00:44:41.884 - 00:45:48.804, Speaker B: We, I've seen a lot over the years. We all have. And nowadays I fully rest my hat on old school traditional finance monetary policy. When I see shit that reminds me of the stuff that the Federal Reserve messes up on and what the IMF and whatever the international government agency wants to throw at us from a legacy tradfi perspective, traditional finance. And when I see folks innovating in the defi space, whether it's on ethereum, l one, avalanche, polygon, arbitrum, what have you, that's what catches my eye when I see disinflationary pressures, when I see share buybacks, what they do in the stock market, when I see it going on with transaction fees, then it's real time and seamless. Every two days, Joe's buying back free float, free liquid float in the open market. That's not just a gimmick, that's some innovative monetary policy.
00:45:48.804 - 00:46:34.580, Speaker B: I'm talking innovative with regard to historic financial standards and it shouldn't be glassed over here. Here's one thing that has changed in my mentality over the last two years. Let's say I had quite a disinterest in memeage and food tokens for quite a while. One thing I hung my hat on early on, and I've reaffirmed in my mind lately, is to peer through the madness, to see through the hype and the exuberance and see what it really is. And that's monetary policy. Find disinflationary pressure, find share buybacks, find even deflation burn components. And that is what seriously affects supply and demand the most.
00:46:35.520 - 00:47:25.890, Speaker C: You know, it's interesting you say that, because, you know one, there's a component to the Yak ecosystem, you know, that I don't think many people have honed in on. And it's that they, what the first thing about yak is that, you know, if you, if anybody here is staking their yak, you know that the yield is shit. Okay? But the thing is, is yak started from very humble beginnings. It was very small. Those initial staking contracts were designed to route the vast majority of ecosystem profits towards ecosystem sustainability. Developers have to be paid, the infrastructure has to be paid for, et cetera, et cetera. The thing is, though, we've already seen hyper growth in the sense that there's almost 200 million Tvl auto compounding now on Yak, which is substantially higher than any other auto compounding yield farm.
00:47:25.890 - 00:48:19.982, Speaker C: And alongside that TVL, all of a sudden there's a lot of profit that's not being distributed to stakers. And the treasury has gotten quite large. So they're actually releasing these new staking contracts, which are going to share much more of what's coming in because they don't need as much anymore to take care of developer salaries, infrastructure costs, et cetera, et cetera. Seeing as yak is an auto compounder, there's actually a single sided staking option for yak that auto compounds into more yak. And what that means is that it's taking protocol profits and continuously buying yak off market. So there's serious, serious buy pressure coming into this token and this pairing. And that buy pressure will only increase as more and more people stake in that auto compounding pool.
00:48:19.982 - 00:49:25.030, Speaker C: And as the total value locked of yak increases as well. I'm forecasting probably $1 billion in TVL for yak, conservatively, by the time this is all said and done. So you have to remember, when you look at things in terms of trying to price future growth, then I think that this token is severely underpriced and you can't even compare it to existing accepted models like YFI because YFI doesn't have this much free yield, liquid yield coming its way. And in terms of Avax incentives, yak is going to be able to capitalize on every bit of incentive that comes into this ecosystem. It's one of the few projects that literally everything that happens here, uh, Yak benefits. Um, and, and when that flywheel gets going, I think we should see some really stupid shit happening, uh, in terms of just non inflationary asset with huge buy pressure that increases, uh, you know, as TVL grows.
00:49:26.050 - 00:49:26.458, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:26.514 - 00:49:28.390, Speaker B: Side of yak, single sided Joe.
00:49:29.050 - 00:49:29.906, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:30.098 - 00:49:31.370, Speaker B: Now we're looking.
00:49:31.530 - 00:50:10.260, Speaker A: I feel like if, if you want to, if someone wants to deploy like a lower risk strategy, it's like, sure, PNg and Joe are probably going to go up, but like Messi said, it is inflationary and once bigger players start to sell, it could get ugly. But with yak, you don't have to pick a winner with whether PNG, Joe or sushi wins. Because if the TvL of Avalanche goes up, then the TVL of yak goes up. And if they turn on the profit sharing, I guess things that if Messi talked about, then I feel like Giaco is going to be a pretty safe play if you want to play the avalanche ecosystem outside of just the Avax token.
00:50:12.040 - 00:50:37.524, Speaker B: Hi. Other than stables, I don't do much LP ing lately. Bancorp is still relevant and their ideology and mentality with regard to impermanent loss is still meaningful in my mind. And we're still early. We're not just early with regard to avalanche. We're still early with regard to the, the entire DeFi landscape. It's good to see the tvls on these types of positions go up.
00:50:37.524 - 00:51:08.912, Speaker B: And I have a great appreciation for what it means to take a cut off of a specific LP position. That reminds me of convex, where, you know, your CVX CRV positions are literally taking a cut of every LP position. And what you're talking to me, when you're talking to me about Yak and the amount of treasury they have, that type of strategy catches my fancy.
00:51:09.096 - 00:52:06.070, Speaker C: Noah, can you imagine after a course curve and such is deployed, can you imagine something like convex making its way over to the avalanche ecosystem? And then you have the actual ability then of something like yak to really, really, really take advantage of, of those high yields and stuff. I mean, my strategy here is I can capture as much of this hypergrowth as I can. And when I reach a certain critical mass and while these curve incentives and such are live, while everything is crazy, you can just drop everything into stables. And I bet you could auto compound two or 300% aby at that point and really, really make a killing without any exposure to downside at all. So I do think that thinking about this in terms of actual strategy and getting more into it than just number go up, number go down, there could be some insane once in a lifetime opportunities that present themselves in the next month.
00:52:06.650 - 00:53:05.440, Speaker B: I agree. Don't get me wrong when I say I'm not into LP's, I do have a moderate risk profile, so I'm quite interested in an ex Joe position. And yak has caught my fancy. And when Ave and curve deploy that, I'm going to throw capital there, you know, there's no reason I wouldn't throw like a quarter mil, a half a mil over the bridge and whether it's, whether it's in the Ethereum principle position or some stables, but that's, that's the same play we did with, with Polygon, where you throw that principle, that collateral onto ave and you just borrow like, you know, a quarter mil where the stables and throwing it onto curve, and you're just getting like 30, 40, 50% just, and it's just coming in and it just doesn't stop. And then you take your, your interest, you roll it over into some speculative asset, you turn ten grand into 100 grand. It's just. Anyway, is there a lot of story?
00:53:06.180 - 00:53:22.076, Speaker C: There's a lot. There's a lot coming, man, like, and a lot of theory involved. See, the thing is, look, I did miss, like, this NFT bubble thing. I am a fucking geek. I like numbers, I like theory. The NFT thing just didn't really suit my fancy. I didn't understand it.
00:53:22.076 - 00:53:46.474, Speaker C: That wasn't my lane. And unfortunately, because I bet I would have had fun, I did stay out for most of that. But for me, this is an opportunity for Defi to get exciting again. I think that there's a lot of people in my shoes that are just DeFi guys that really, really love the Defi game, the game theory and everything that comes along with it. And this is an opportunity for us to have our fun, too.
00:53:46.562 - 00:54:28.946, Speaker B: So, yeah, there's a very important overlying statement that could be made about NFTs and DeFi and strategy. The biggest mistake I see in NFTs is people buy them and try and sell them immediately. And this isn't a diamond hands type thing, this is. It's important I take what I do very professionally. This is obviously for everyone listening. I treat this as dividend investing like the traditional finance markets, and it is imperative to find conviction. And I'm never early and never late.
00:54:28.946 - 00:55:13.454, Speaker B: So when I deploy capital, it's not for a day, it's not for a week, it's probably not for a month. And it's more likely for a decent time horizon, like even a cycle one to five years. I have 160 grand worth of FX FSX locked for the next four years. I have capital locked in ve curve like another 160 that's locked for another four years. So find conviction, find time horizon, and don't, don't look for necessarily a quick gain. Now don't get me wrong. Ten x on ten grand, flipping to 100 grand, sure, there's no reason not to liquidate, but look, look what's happened in the NFT space.
00:55:13.454 - 00:55:44.240, Speaker B: You flip a punk, which we're 30 Ethereum, and now you can sell it for 150, but then in a week or two, you'll be able to sell it for 200, 300. So that's why I like, really, this hashtag, time horizon, and don't think about selling certain assets. And that means. What does that mean? That means entry is the most critical. So, like, Joe has ripped 40 x. I got my microscope out. I'm looking for that.
00:55:44.240 - 00:55:59.586, Speaker B: The early players taking their capital gains, and when it hits that diphthere, buy the fear and then you sell the exuberance. So I want to look to buy the fear. I'm looking for my entries.
00:55:59.738 - 00:56:03.670, Speaker C: Did I do anything for a Joe dip right now? Like I gotta tell you that much?
00:56:04.810 - 00:56:06.630, Speaker A: Well, yeah, it's crazy because, like.
00:56:07.050 - 00:56:30.318, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I don't know if it's inevitable, but here's another. Here's a. It's a lot of psychology, and I think about these things all too much. Maybe it doesn't happen. And that's okay. I remind everyone what we have is opportunity overload. It's okay to miss an opportunity.
00:56:30.318 - 00:57:19.518, Speaker B: And it might not feel that way, but I guarantee you we're so early. And there's always going to be another opportunity, whether it's on another chain, necessarily. Maybe, maybe. But there will always be another opportunity. So the fomo, that emotion, you have, that anxiety, that adrenaline rush, sure, sometimes it's okay to comply with it and listen to what it says, but sometimes it's the important thing to not necessarily respond. And you wait for that emotion to subside and you could find some serious, serious, logical and rational entries sorry, my name is flapping around. Captain Rational.
00:57:19.518 - 00:57:21.650, Speaker B: I'm too rational sometimes, boys.
00:57:22.830 - 00:58:00.652, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, let's talk about buying the fear because I feel like we've talked about bullish things about avalanche, but let's talk about what could go wrong because there's a non zero chance that avalanche doesn't do well. So I have a few, I guess, bearish cases for avalanche that I want to run through, guys. So first is the token unlocks so the bunch of VC's or I guess early investors. Let me share my screen. Actually, on September 4, I know you're going to say messy, but on September 4 there's going to be a bunch of tokens being unlocked from these private sales. I think these people got it for like $0.50.
00:58:00.652 - 00:58:45.640, Speaker A: So they're sitting at like 100 x right now. Uh, so that could be something that, you know, like maybe some people cash out, right? I mean, how can you blame them, right? They're sitting at 100 x. And I guess another data point that could be bearish is I asked the Eva labs team like when Aave and Curve is launching and when I first talked to them, they said like late September, sorry, late August or early September. But now they are saying that like it might be in a few weeks. So maybe like there's a slight delay in like when that critical mass liquidity will occur. Am I missing any other like, bearish cases? And I guess the question is, like, are those like bearish cases enough to like be relatively conservative? That's an open question.
00:58:46.540 - 00:59:19.680, Speaker C: I've heard the, the bearish case for unlocks, you know, be made time and time again. And then the meme always presents itself afterwards, which is bullish unlocks. Solana specifically had a huge unlock that there was a lot of fud about. A lot of people were scared about it. And this was back when the Solana token was very cheap, maybe $1, $2. Everybody's in so much profit, they're just going to sell. And I think the answer to that we can take some of what Noah was saying earlier about time horizons.
00:59:19.680 - 01:00:09.852, Speaker C: You have to remember that a lot of the people that did invest in this may be in significant profit, but theyre not just investing in it for a quick flip. Theyre investing in it because they see avalanche becoming a network that has substantial market share in the future of decentralized finance. I think that thats something thats very possible considering that avalanche has subnets and things like that that are going to allow for these institutional portals and a government can have a subnet there's just so much growth opportunity here. And alongside the deflationary mechanics of the token itself makes it a very, very interesting longer term hold. But in terms of these unlocks, will there be some that do take profit?
01:00:09.996 - 01:00:10.680, Speaker A: Sure.
01:00:11.180 - 01:00:55.220, Speaker C: But at the same time, think about how much profit needs to be taken for those investors to be free. Rolling with zero risk on this investment other than unrealized gains. Think about taking profit and realizing capital gains on that and creating that tax liability for yourself. I highly, highly, highly doubt that these unlocks are bearish in any regard. If anything, know, all of a sudden people go from potential value to actual value when those events occur and when there's actual value involved, there's more exposure, there's more incentive to grow that value, et cetera, et cetera.
01:00:57.720 - 01:01:06.384, Speaker A: Hit all time highs. The last unlock for avalanche, I think it hit all time highs soon after. It was like a bullish unlock.
01:01:06.512 - 01:01:22.020, Speaker B: What's the total supply increase after all unlocks are complete? Maybe we could get a percent. Like would increase circulating supply 50%. Will it double circulating supply? That'd be an interesting one. As well as the time horizon for all unlocks to complete.
01:01:22.520 - 01:01:26.952, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't have that information off the top of my head, but let's.
01:01:26.976 - 01:01:57.150, Speaker B: Say that takes another year for all unlocks. Well, I saw 1.5 for one of those tranches. Let's say it takes another two years. If you pop in a four year time horizon, you're going to have no more transitory depreciative events where there's a significant amount of liquidity coming onto the market as a sell pressure. So from, in my eyes, the play, the overall macro play for me is a core avax position. It's not going to be too large.
01:01:57.150 - 01:02:41.480, Speaker B: Five, six, seven, 8% of the portfolio. And it's particularly because it's a disinflationary asset as compared to polygon, which is inflationary currently. So disinflationary peaks my interest significantly and the vast majority overall of my Avax position will be given free from the incentivized liquidity mining. And that's something to consider and that's my risk minimize approach to the ecosystem overall. But the point being I typically shy away from core protocol assets like BNB. I shied away from and even matic after a while. But Avax has that monetary policy that hits my fancy.
01:02:43.820 - 01:03:25.622, Speaker A: Yeah, the token burns are pretty cool. So I kind of want to transition the topic to, I guess, opportunities elsewhere because we talked about avalanche for an hour and I want to talk about two other ecosystems that interest me personally. First is being Cardano. So don't get me wrong, I'm not a huge fan of Cardano. I think it's overvalued right now at its current market cap. But when they do release smart contracts on September 12, I think it's going to present an amazing opportunity just because. Maybe I'm going to sound like an asshole for saying this, but I feel like when Defi on Cardano launches, when and if it launches, there's going to be so many retail investors that have never done DeFi before that's going to just pour money into the space.
01:03:25.622 - 01:03:54.800, Speaker A: And I think as a farmer, it'll be one of the easiest farm and dump opportunities of all time. And I kind of want to ask this question to you, Messi, because I feel like my initial Cardano hate came from being on Twitter too much. Just because everyone just hates on Cardano, right? It's just like, it's kind of like a group thing situation where it's like people make friends by just hating on Cardano. Why do you think there's this huge discrepancy between, I guess, cardano on Twitter versus Cardano on YouTube, for example?
01:03:55.100 - 01:04:32.330, Speaker C: Well, I think a lot of it stems. If you look at the Twitter tribalism, the main tribes, of course, are going to be the bitcoin maximalists. And then you have Ethereum guys. I think those two tribes have grown to be the largest. And of course, Ethereum guys hate it when they see potential elsewhere because that detracts from Ethereum, that takes attention away from Ethereum. And then you've got Charles Hoskinson, who was one of the founders of Ethereum, if I'm not mistaken. So there's that component as well that adds to the hate that he would leave, that he would do this.
01:04:32.330 - 01:05:34.980, Speaker C: But, you know, with anything that goes, I mean, like, as hard as Cardano has gone, you know, you're going to have hate. You know, I hate that I missed out on Cardano. I was very wrong about Cardano. I had no idea it was going to do what it did. And, you know, it's going nuts and it continues to go nuts. And, you know, the thing is, we're seeing a theme emerge now, though, that Ethereum is losing market share. The issue with Ethereum is that the original implementation and model of Ethereum wasn't scalable enough and the fixes to that are taking too long and the ecosystem is evolving too rapidly at the moment for that to be something that plays out well, I 100% agree you know, I think it's the biggest no brainer play in the world to invest in some of those primitives in the Cardano ecosystem.
01:05:34.980 - 01:06:22.376, Speaker C: There's going to be a lot of people that won't do it at first just because they have this intense hate for it. But I'm interested to hear what you have to say about Hex Noah, because I remember you mentioned something about that earlier in the stream. Hex being one of the best performing assets on Ethereum through Bull Bear, et cetera, et cetera. Hex arguably kicking off defi summer hex, putting uniswap on the map, really showing that Uniswap can operate with deep liquidity and volume. But look, there's always going to be hitters for everything. There's a lot of haters on the avalanche right now. The main piece of advice I have is to never be a maximalist about anything.
01:06:22.376 - 01:06:31.420, Speaker C: You should be an opportunity maximalist rather than a community member, a bag holder of a certain ecosystem.
01:06:32.000 - 01:06:33.740, Speaker B: Allegiance to the portfolio.
01:06:34.160 - 01:06:34.940, Speaker C: Yes.
01:06:35.480 - 01:06:38.208, Speaker B: Look at these gas prices. This is extraordinary.
01:06:38.384 - 01:06:39.968, Speaker C: Is that on Ethereum right now?
01:06:40.064 - 01:06:48.550, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a lease. Someone's minting jpegs, I guess. Like, how can you use Defi? It's been like a few minutes.
01:06:51.010 - 01:07:20.006, Speaker B: I'd refrain myself from engaging in transaction. I personally don't mind, and I'm able to operate with, you know, two $300 transaction fees for the vast majority of Ethereum. But yeah, when it's a $1000 tooth, I'm not doing transactions at a 1000, $2,000. But that also brings. I'm not going to digress too much into that. I still think Ethereum has a lot of meat to it. And yes, it does price out a massive amount of participants.
01:07:20.006 - 01:07:47.890, Speaker B: But the billionaires and the 100 millionaires, they don't flinch an eye out of the two, three, four dollar, 500 transaction fees. And they want the time tested protocols. They're not necessarily. They wouldn't want exposure at all to risk. If you throw it around a half a bill, you're in curve, you're an aave, you're in the protocols that have a year and a half and $10 billion worth of capital on it for an extended period of time anyway. So two things. Cardano.
01:07:47.890 - 01:08:17.226, Speaker B: I'm the anti hater. I won't own Cardano. I'm not. Why particularly? I'm not a buy low, sell high guy, necessarily. And you're not going to get a ten x on Cardano necessarily. If you want the ten x, you're looking for something that has not been found yet. And avalanche is the ecosystem defines those projects where you could actually engage with Amms and not going through $300 transaction fees.
01:08:17.226 - 01:08:39.750, Speaker B: So the ecosystem to do that type of or expose yourself to that type of opportunity right now really is avalanche. With regard to Cardano and smart contracts, I like to say, bring it on. Show me an opportunity. Bridge some capital. Show me the amms, show me the money markets. We're going to use it. That's exactly what we're doing with Avalanche.
01:08:39.750 - 01:09:03.983, Speaker B: That's exactly what we'll do with Cardano. And the same story is with flare. That's another network that I look forward to. Why? Because that brings. There's an interesting phrase that I like to use is called stagnant equity. It's when you have a $20 billion asset that there's no debt, there's equity in it. But that's XRP.
01:09:03.983 - 01:09:27.460, Speaker B: No one's borrowing against it. It's a base layer asset. But there's billions of dollars worth of capital that no one's using, no one's borrowing stables, no one's leveraging it. So that's a great thing that I see and I believe that that's going to be interesting. Flare rolls out. What do you got, Andre? I love reading his stuff.
01:09:27.620 - 01:10:05.296, Speaker A: I feel like Messi talked about. I feel like Messi generally has this compounding strategy and this rotation game. And I feel like the macro rotation game is in between ecosystems because I feel like after polygon, the other ecosystems, the other foundations learned that, hey, these liquidity mining incentives, right? So avalanche is just like doing a larger one, $180 million. And I feel like Cordano might do one. I think Charles said they're never going to give away tokens, but who knows? There'll be some incentive. And I think Phantom is interesting too because their TbL is growing with zero incentives. And I don't think they want to compete with Avalanche right now.
01:10:05.296 - 01:10:09.528, Speaker A: But this could be like a Q four or Q 120 22 play.
01:10:09.704 - 01:10:13.160, Speaker B: This is interesting because Andre has always had a penchant for Phantom.
01:10:13.280 - 01:10:23.392, Speaker A: Yeah, he loves. I know, I know how much technology. Yeah, Andre Messi. But this could be an interesting opportunity too.
01:10:23.496 - 01:10:42.290, Speaker C: No, I've got no, I've got no issue with Andre. I mean, that whole fiasco, it was just stupid. You know, I think we both moved past it. You know, he's super smart guys, done a lot of interesting things in Defi. So, you know, I'm actually an Andre fan. I hate, I hate that I got rugged. But you know what? It's been part of the game, it just is what it is.
01:10:42.290 - 01:11:41.520, Speaker C: But moving beyond that, if Fanta were to announce some kind of ecosystem growth incentives or something like that, I think you'd be an absolute moron not to go over there and play it as well. I think Avalanche, though, was really the moment for everyone where everybody is looking for that next moment where they can be early and maybe the alpha is degrading a bit here. And there's a lot of things on fandom that have already had that initial hyper growth and they're just kind of chilling for the time being. But for the moment, you're not going to be able to compete with ecosystem incentives. Curve can launch incentives on Phantom, which is, I'm sure what Andre is referring to here rather than ecosystem incentives. But you can't compete with, at these prices, $180 million of Defi incentives. What people are disregarding is this incentive program can very well become a $500 million incentive program with growth in the Avax token itself.
01:11:41.520 - 01:11:45.832, Speaker C: So something really interesting to consider. Samson.
01:11:45.856 - 01:12:10.280, Speaker A: I agree. Yeah. I think when they first announced $180 million, the price of Avax was maybe dollar 30. Now it's at 50 essentially. And as that goes up, then there's more and more money flowing through the ecosystem. And Avaxhe right now it's below the market cap of polygon, which I mean, it's. I think this thing has like, like Matthew said, like over $100.
01:12:12.820 - 01:12:14.252, Speaker B: I'd say that's the market cap.
01:12:14.356 - 01:12:18.400, Speaker A: I don't know. Right now it's the market cap. Eight and a half. Let me share my screen.
01:12:21.060 - 01:12:36.920, Speaker B: I mean, I always love to say, why can't it be Cardano? Why can't it be, you know, 50, 60? So why can't it pull a BNB 60, 70, $80 billion? We tempted to think that Polygon would head up to a top ten region?
01:12:38.020 - 01:12:48.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Polygon kicked out like 16 billion before bitcoin topped. And if bitcoin didn't top, maybe they would have gone like 25 billion. Right? We never know. Bitcoin's the king.
01:12:49.860 - 01:13:21.110, Speaker C: Are you guys familiar with Defi llama? Yeah, it's one place that I'm watching because there's a chains tab and you can go click on that. I've been watching that to approximate flows between ecosystems. Right now we have a large growth in avalanche TVL so I'm watching the binance and matic ecosystems for outflows there and making the assumption before we have these tools in place that those flows would probably avalanche.
01:13:21.730 - 01:13:24.930, Speaker A: Yeah, polygon minus the 11% in the past seven days.
01:13:25.090 - 01:13:34.218, Speaker B: Avalanche essentially double on chain data. This is, you know, what's his name that does all that on chain data?
01:13:34.354 - 01:13:38.042, Speaker C: Willy. Willy. Yeah, there's a couple of them.
01:13:38.186 - 01:13:57.328, Speaker B: This is. This is everything. And this cross chain flows catches my fancy because I'm a transaction fees kind of guy. Transaction fees are the ultimate sustainable source of revenue. And those are the protocols that will catch my eye the most. Like, hot protocols catch my eye. Cross chain.
01:13:57.328 - 01:14:01.020, Speaker B: No impermanent loss, just pure transaction fees.
01:14:02.080 - 01:14:24.640, Speaker A: Yeah. And one thing I want to point out is terra number three, with only seven protocols. I mean, once more protocols. Come on, Terra. I feel like this TBL is going to grow. I've been bullish Luna for a while now, but I think you two should look into it because the tokenomics of Luna is pretty insane. As long as the demand for USD is going up, then Luna has to be burnt.
01:14:24.640 - 01:14:30.996, Speaker A: It's like ponzonomics, but not actually a Ponzi. That's how I explain it to my friends.
01:14:31.148 - 01:14:52.580, Speaker B: Opportunity overload, guys. You can never own everything you want to own. We have not even touched on the cosmos hubs. We haven't talked about Polkadot and we haven't talked about the BSN and the China narrative that I talk about. And they're all connected. They're tied into the digital yuan. We're talking about the sovereign level and the cbdcs.
01:14:52.580 - 01:15:19.500, Speaker B: What you have to do is opportunity cost analysis, which you do very nicely, Taiki. And you're talking about what is going to outperform the best in the short term. How long is the capital deployment? Is it just the short term capital gains and you're going to rotate your capital or you're going to park capital and capitalize on transaction fees? You got to pick your time horizon. Opportunity overload, boys and girls, out there in crypto land.
01:15:20.800 - 01:15:29.952, Speaker A: So I've kind of exhausted all the topics I want to talk about. Like, is there anything that you two want to talk about? Like whether you're, like, avalanche or any other ecosystem that you're excited for?
01:15:30.096 - 01:16:06.178, Speaker B: Massively wanted me a hit on hacks. I. Yeah, I like talking controversial because so many folks have their opinions and I have no capacity to assess, nor do I have much interest in assessing on chain who owns what. And is it ultimately some sort of conspiracy? What I understand is that it's a rudimentary smart contract. It's basically compared to the complexity of other contracts. It's baby smart contract. And all it is fundamentally boys and girls is incentivized supply disruption with the time lock.
01:16:06.178 - 01:16:54.848, Speaker B: How many protocols have a time lock component? The e curve. And anyone that creams got their ice cream nowadays, pickles got their dills. There's plenty of multi year time lock components. So all hexes is a time lock. 40% inflation derived yield, which is nothing extraordinary and one heck of a community and marketing implementation. So for folks that I don't have a capacity to say whether there's any manipulation or not, it's irrelevant. What's pertinent is that I don't find that much of an impressive asset because I'm not a buy low, sell high kind of guy.
01:16:54.848 - 01:17:38.096, Speaker B: Sure, you could buy hex and watch it, appreciate in price, and then you sell it, but I have no interest in locking it. If you lock it for a day or you lock it for a week, you're getting nothing on your money. It's basically a very small, trivial percentage return. And overall, my focus is weekly returns because I want to produce a salary, and I cannot do that with hex. So my sentiment and the way I talk about the protocol is it's not very useful at all. Just to be honest, guys and folks out there in defi land.
01:17:38.288 - 01:18:16.688, Speaker C: Oh, it's not. You've got. Here's the thing, though, and I know this left curve, right curve mean has been pretty prevalent on crypto Twitter this year. When you look at hex and you look at who it actually appeals to, who would lock up a shitcoin for 1015 years? It's a very left curve type thing. But you know what? The left curvers are seemingly in abundance, and there's plenty of people to do it. The supply, there's centralization there. To be honest, I don't care what anybody says.
01:18:16.688 - 01:19:03.200, Speaker C: The smartest thing that I could have done was to realize this back in December of 2020, November of 2020, gone all in on hex and just walked away and laughed at everybody as they attempted to make fun of me. But I ended up being rich. The smart people played the situation as, hey, all the left covers are going to buy this up and lock their shit up 15 years. So I'm just going to buy it and hold it, and then I'm going to use the amm to exit after extreme multiples. But you know what? I feel like that opportunity, for the most part, has already sailed. There's probably better elsewhere at this point, but you can't really hate on hex. It is what it is, and it's performed exceptionally well relative to literally everything else.
01:19:04.420 - 01:19:26.182, Speaker B: Valid statement. You can't hate on it. It's just nothing exciting. It's not interesting. It's not fundamental to a financial system. It's an incentivized supply disruption. Inflationary asset, by the way, has decreasing volume.
01:19:26.182 - 01:19:32.490, Speaker B: So obviously the price is vertical and the volume is decreasing. So there's a heck of a divergence going on.
01:19:32.960 - 01:20:22.670, Speaker A: And speaking of the left curve, right curve meme, it's like even three arrows capital, right? Just like one of the largest gigabreeans in the space has dogecoin as they're like, one of the larger investments that they've made. And there was like a recent podcast with Suzu on Uncommon core where he was talking super bullishly about Dogecoin. And I feel like I'm also coping in the sense that I just ignored all these things that other people call scams. But you kind of have to have an open mind, right? Because if you don't have an open mind, then you're going to be back holding, like ETH based defi and like, like, under forming assets for a long time. You just have to be open minded and like, rotate, play the rotation game and, you know, just even if, like, your Twitter timeline is hating on a particular asset, it's just like, you know, don't. Don't hate on it, right?
01:20:23.810 - 01:21:02.770, Speaker B: There's no need for hate. And back holding is an interesting one. This time around. I am in a certain mindset where it is different this time. We'll see, obviously, a cycle in the valuations of our principal assets, but we didn't have financial systems in 2017 and 18. I didn't have a capacity to get 60% returns in my capital little by lending and over collateralized depositions or transaction fees. Do you think it a bear market? Uniswap and one inch and curve are not going to be doing transaction fees.
01:21:02.770 - 01:21:20.960, Speaker B: That is technologically different this time. This is not icos. There is something that is going to be fascinating over the next one, two, three years, is to really see what is different this time. And I think there's something very, very different.
01:21:22.180 - 01:22:08.220, Speaker C: I think so as well, which is really interesting because being in crypto as long as I have, there's an old mantra which is there's only the pump. These things get pumped and they get dumped, and that's it. That's just the way it works. But I'm having a lot of difficulty right now adjusting my way of thinking about these things. But I think you're 100% right in that. Investing in some of these DeFi protocols now would be akin to investing in some of these early stage Internet companies way, way, way back. I'm sure people here have a grandfather, somebody they know that invested big in IBM or another company like that that ended up making big, ended up becoming a large part of the future that we occupy.
01:22:08.220 - 01:22:39.200, Speaker C: And I'm not sure yet I who ends up in that slot. I don't know. Is curve the one that makes it? Is Abe the one that makes it. But I do think that having that longer term horizon could end up being one of the best investment decisions of my life if I'm able to even pivot to that kind of thinking. Which is something I'm still really struggling with here. But I see the argument for it. I think the argument's very sound.
01:22:39.200 - 01:22:43.480, Speaker C: And I don't think enough people are thinking about that argument right now.
01:22:43.940 - 01:23:30.930, Speaker B: Wouldn't entirely discount old school methodology as well, which is obviously not consistent with my current methodology. But buy low, sell high capital gains and at the end of whatever the cycle may be, stable coins, they work, you have returns. There is. What fascinates me the most is no matter what, whether defi may become what we think it may become, whether it's just different this time or it's not, there's literally no reason for stable coins to exit the crypto space. There is no yield in legacy finance. You get jack shit in a bank account, you get nothing in the legacy financial markets and you're getting double digit percentages on your stable coins in crypto space.
01:23:31.270 - 01:24:19.770, Speaker C: I think thats a really good point. A lot of people of course have made fun of sue relentlessly for his super cycle theory. But one of the biggest supporting factors to that supercycle is that capital has no incentive to exit this system now. And now we exist in an environment where the base unit of liquidity for everything isnt an extremely volatile asset like bitcoin its dollars. So if you do want to play the capital gains game, if you do want to capture momentum, there's an opportunity now for you to capture that momentum and then remain exposed to the ecosystem and be ready to sit there and buy the dip. Now I don't know. Is bitcoin bottom end? I've got a really good feeling it is, but you can never be too certain.
01:24:19.770 - 01:25:21.534, Speaker C: But if it is, that was a very short bear market and I think the retracement was about 50% and that would be the shallowest retracement for a cycle in bitcoins history. But another interesting thing is if you look at the actual structure of bitcoin at the top it wasnt a parabola this time. It is, if you look at it on certain timeframes, but it wasnt this mania blow off, off, et cetera, et cetera. The liquidity in this ecosystem is substantially improved relative to even what it was in 2017. And now with the amount of stable coins we have here, it could become the situation where it's a self fulfilling prophecy, where bitcoin does become a store of value, where the volatility is reduced. It's going to be interesting to observe that dynamic and the impact of stable coins of this ecosystem and the capital being parked in this ecosystem and not leaving. I think over the next coming years, things could get very interesting.
01:25:21.534 - 01:26:18.580, Speaker C: This doesnt have to just bubble and be three or bear market. In other words, theres people that are ready and waiting to get back in. Support these markets, support the ecosystem. The most incredible thing ive seen here is you see these industry incumbents like FTX coins base that are investing big in the ecosystem this time rather than just extracting all the profit and not putting anything back in Coinbase. Of course, with $500 million in crypto purchases, which is very interesting wording, and also a commitment to continue to push revenue that they generate from this ecosystem into reinvesting in the ecosystem. I mean, there's some interesting dynamics here that we've never seen before. So I think we're in unprecedented territory and it'd be very difficult to forecast how this plays out.
01:26:19.480 - 01:27:27.610, Speaker B: I agree. You know what's interesting? The sense I get just from a social media, not my personal sentiment. What weve seen since a good part from March 2020, which ended in September, and then it was low until about January, and it obviously ended with our most recent top, the legacy finance sees that as exuberance. Yeah, we know what exuberance feels like, and weve seen it on the micro scale with DeFi, summer isolated and BSC and then Polygon, I don't think we've seen it yet. With Avalanche. The sentiment I get between March of 2020, which was basically the start of our overall larger scale cycle, coming off of 2018, misery, $3,000 lows on bitcoin, I get that. My sentiment is this is just capital inflow.
01:27:27.610 - 01:27:41.450, Speaker B: I don't get the sense that this is like that parabola or that exuberance of the overall market. I just feel it's capital inflow and that's the narrative changing for what this really is.
01:27:42.590 - 01:28:07.352, Speaker A: Yeah, same for me. Once you bridge, once you on ramp into DeFi, I just have no incentive to bring it back to fiat. Right? So I have a question for you guys. Like, I just got my girlfriend to get. Get on blockfi, right? Because she's like, what's farming? Can I try? And I was like, okay. Like, just do blockfi first. Like, you two have, like, what? You two are married? Like, have you gotten your significant others into, like, crypto, like, farming?
01:28:07.376 - 01:28:07.616, Speaker B: I guess.
01:28:07.648 - 01:28:13.300, Speaker A: I mean, I know, like, blockfi is like, it's not only farming, but it kind of is, I guess, from, like, a more normie standpoint.
01:28:16.090 - 01:28:16.634, Speaker B: You first.
01:28:16.682 - 01:28:55.740, Speaker C: I haven't. I'm the crazy crypto dude. Nobody gives a shit what I say to their detriment. But it's been that way for a long time. And I remember early on, I was more enthusiastic about sharing my passion with those in my family and friends, even people that were close. But the further and further I got into this ecosystem, I just realized that I can. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make a drink, you know, and I had tried to lead the horse to water, and, you know, I wasn't going to beat the dead horse and continue to try to help these people, you know, make money and expose to a bit of risk in this ecosystem.
01:28:55.740 - 01:28:59.140, Speaker C: It's their loss, and, you know, it just is what it is.
01:29:00.520 - 01:29:20.900, Speaker B: I agree. That's so spot on. You can't. You can't. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't force them to drink. So all my family, no matter what age group, no interest, and what I tell them, it's literally just think of it as banking and get two, three, 4% on stables and Aave, and they don't even know what banking is. They don't even know.
01:29:20.900 - 01:29:42.746, Speaker B: They're so departed from even rational financial management, which is a good part of how I handle my stream, is just rethinking financials and capital management. Yet alone. What we do is more than just managing capital. We're just. We're aggressively attacking opportunity. But my wife, I have some. She knows what I do.
01:29:42.746 - 01:30:05.406, Speaker B: Everything top to bottom. Not that she could do it, but she has a decent set of instructions that I put together. And she knows how to use one inch. She knows how to use Gemini. She knows swap it to GUSD, and that's your capital off ramp to Gemini. She's never going to be able to figure out how to, how to liquidate, like blocknet service node or a syscoin master. No, that's another story.
01:30:05.406 - 01:30:15.210, Speaker B: Operating through the. Through terminal and so on and so forth. But she knows how to get convex yield. She knows how to. How to.
01:30:15.550 - 01:30:17.410, Speaker C: That's badass, Noah.
01:30:17.990 - 01:30:31.490, Speaker B: It's pretty good. The one rule she thinks is that if anything ever happened to me is I'm not going to sell anything. So she promise me she won't sell it and she'll just take the yield, the profits.
01:30:32.550 - 01:30:57.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, farming is so addicting once you, like, start making money. Because there's, like, this quote where, like, 90% of traders, like, lose money, right? Or just, like, they don't. They're not winning traders. But I feel like when it comes to farming, 90% of farmers make money and 10% just, like, take on too much risk and get rubbed. I feel like farming is, like, much, like, much more friendlier introduction to crypto and defi. And once you understand forming, like, you can pick out these ecosystems.
01:30:57.650 - 01:31:25.284, Speaker A: Like, the reason I knew avalanche was going to be big was because I was forming on Polygon. And, like, the reason Polygon did well was the liquidity mining incentives, right? So, yeah, I mean, whenever I told my friends that, like, I do, like, a yield farming channel, it's like they. They look at me funny. It's like, what the fuck is this? I went to school with this guy. But, yeah, I mean, it just means we're still early and, yeah, it's crazy things we can do. Like, stablecoin yields are insane, et cetera.
01:31:25.452 - 01:32:10.490, Speaker B: That's why I frame it all in legacy financial terms, because that's hard enough people. You got to understand, the vast majority of people that ever hear you probably have credit card debt and spend more than they make, and don't think of the dollar as what it really is. The dollar is an asset. Are you buying dollars? Are you investing in dollars? Today you work, at the end of the week, you get a paycheck. Your paycheck is denominated, let's say, in the work and your employers choosing to buy you dollars, to give you dollars. So I try and turn the tables on a lot of what's accepted as status quo to get people to think, this isn't gambling, boys and girls. I treat this very professionally, and yield is real.
01:32:10.490 - 01:32:43.566, Speaker B: The yield does not exist in legacy finance. And a good reason everyone that hears me every day when I stream and it sounds strange, these topics sound strange. It's because there is no damn yield in legacy finance. It doesn't exist. There's nothing strange about interest and yield and returns for your capital investment. It's just that it's done. You get 3% on a stock that's negative 2%, inflation adjusted.
01:32:43.566 - 01:32:50.210, Speaker B: So the real yields are negative. You're screwed. But you could actually make this whole thing work in the crypto space.
01:32:51.830 - 01:33:42.124, Speaker C: I feel like everything that we're seeing right now with an abundance of yield, et cetera, et cetera, was something that the previous generation, once upon a time, saw in the legacy world. This is an opportunity for my generation to come in and. And have that same upside as they did. And I think that we're very early here in that regard. We're still to the point where the people that are really benefiting from this are trailblazers or pioneers. And, of course, we're having these on ramps and portals for people that don't want to get their hands really dirty to come capture these yields. I do have friends and friends of family that have asked me about things like blockfi and stuff like that, and even my dad's friends and stuff.
01:33:42.124 - 01:34:12.680, Speaker C: My dad's too proud to ever do anything that I would talk about. But his friends know that I've been very successful, and they've asked me things like, what do you think about this? I can get 5% of my dollars. They think that that's lucrative. And they're always shocked when I say, or you think 5% is nuts if you want to get your hands really dirty. How about this? And they're like, oh, no, no, no, 5% is good for me, but that's kind of just where we're at right now.
01:34:13.340 - 01:34:28.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, when curve and Aave launches, like, the yields are going to be insane. I think when. I think when Curve first launched on polygon, you can earn 30% on stables. It was absolutely insane. Thats going to bring on so much liquidity.
01:34:28.294 - 01:35:14.314, Speaker B: And, yeah, its nowadays were old in DeFi when we could say, I remember 80% returns on stablecoin positions directly on curve. I had curve. I was a liquidity provider on curve before the curve asset, before the curve Dow. And they threw around so much in that and that vested over that just recently finished vesting. But curve, it's an interesting story. I very much look forward to curve on avalanche because I know exactly what it's going to do. The defi space is littered with what's called a literary foreshadow, but it's with technology in this instance.
01:35:14.314 - 01:35:41.280, Speaker B: But what happens throughout history tends to happen in some shape or form, is that whole stock chart or chart idea where history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. So that's exactly what we just saw with binance smart chain, which led the polygon, which will lead to avalanche for the exact same reasons those financial systems experience what they experienced.
01:35:42.900 - 01:36:16.776, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And curve isn't just going to bring liquidity and give stablecoin yield. It's also going to pave ways for other crypto. Crypto decent crypto applications to create products. Because like I mentioned, like I showed earlier, there's zero liquidity for USDC right now, avalanche. But when that does come online, then there's going to be all sorts of products that's going to center on USDC, Dai tether, for example, like Iron Finance. Right? I'm pretty certain that iron finance, that team is going to make something on avalanche.
01:36:16.848 - 01:36:17.512, Speaker C: Got it.
01:36:17.656 - 01:36:35.448, Speaker A: Like, like, that team makes amazing Ponzi. Like, I've researched all of their products and, like, they make the best Ponzi nomics. It's actually kind of insane. Like, so, uh, like every single iron finance Ponzi just like, collapses at the end of the day. But, like, anyone that's really will make a fuck ton of money always be.
01:36:35.464 - 01:37:15.338, Speaker C: At the top of the pyramid, you know? And I don't think people realize just how awesome curve is too. You know, I just want to discuss this for a second. The token economics are absolutely extraordinary. And then with Curve V two, I don't think people realize how serious of a competitor it is outside of stablecoins in the amm space. Those guys are smart as hell. And if you really dig into what they built and the capabilities of the system, we're just at the tip of the iceberg right now. It can get, it can get really, really weird really fast if we start being able to even explore some of these new technologies.
01:37:15.338 - 01:37:47.520, Speaker C: And we need places like Matic, like Avalanche, where, you know, like Phantom even, you know, and I think curve can really come and thrive there and, you know, realize its full potential. And then too, you know, I, I haven't delved as much into this, but, you know, Noah's really big on Amm positions as part of portfolio optimization. There's a lot of interesting theory behind that. Curve is a big part of that. So super interesting stuff. I hope we get to discuss that more at a date soon.
01:37:48.100 - 01:38:16.302, Speaker B: My pleasure. We'll schedule some time. My pension, guys, I want to own this. I want to own this shit. As much as it's nice to have a capital gain. And you got to remember, if you buy an asset at a dollar and it goes to $50, you just sold the asset that you potentially really, really like, and now you don't have it anymore. And that's the same thought that I have about nfTs, you buy an NFT really cheap.
01:38:16.302 - 01:38:49.260, Speaker B: You sell a punk at 200 ETH, you don't have it anymore. That has always stuck with me. I don't like the assets that I've identified. I really appreciate them more than just wanting to sell them to experience a capital gain. I think these assets will work for me so I don't have to work for myself. And that's my goal. I want assets that will just crank out revenue for the next 50 years and that'll make me happy.
01:38:49.760 - 01:39:41.440, Speaker C: Can you imagine a future to where you're 100% right about that? You were like one of the early investors and the infrastructure behind finance itself. I think 20 years from now, if any of us end up being correct, you could look back on these moments and you could be like, wow, if only I had known how crazy this would be. It's the same thing as, and this is much smaller scale, but when I first got into avalanche ecosystem and I put like 20% of my portfolio over here and then three days later I was like, holy shit, I need to move like 50% plus, like right now. Because this is it. This is an opportunity. It'll be one of those moments where you look back and in retrospect, you would just be like, damn, why didn't I just all end this shit? My whole family would be set forever. It could end up being a wild opportunity.
01:39:41.440 - 01:40:01.450, Speaker C: And even if it's not, there's very few opportunities in today's investment climate to wherever you have that level of risk reward. You know, even if you are wrong, you stuck your neck out and you took the risk out or you took the amount of risk appropriate to end up being a legend, you know, for potentially generations, you know, which is a really interesting thing to think about.
01:40:01.610 - 01:40:23.190, Speaker A: Yeah, the ev of avalanche is so high. And that's something I kind of. I kind of didn't, like, think too hard, I guess, because I was, like, pretty early, right? Because I think I was one of the first persons to, like, tell you about avalanche Messi. But, like, I only bought like, a vaccine png. But I obviously should have, like, I diversified more, but yeah, like, just two.
01:40:23.230 - 01:40:25.690, Speaker B: Weeks ago, this was three weeks ago, a month ago.
01:40:26.670 - 01:40:42.440, Speaker A: And just like, they're your banana suit. I'm like, okay, yeah, Messi's completely right. I have to, like, gain a little bit more exposure. I bought some, like, chain link bags. I mean, I like, I like chain link, but, like, there's opportunity cost. Yeah. And, like, there's.
01:40:42.440 - 01:41:28.678, Speaker A: You have to build conviction and. Yeah, like, yeah, and, yeah, I talked to you and see like, like you just like flipped. Like, you just like, because a lot of people that I told, I guess like a lot of the Ogs that I like talk to, they kind of have their eco chamber of like, you know, only eth, only Solano, like only trading, but like you like flipped on a dime. It's like, oh, yeah, like you used it, you bridged overdem, you used it and you're like, okay, like, this is going to be big and I prophesy for that. And I think in the next coming weeks, more opportunities will come curb and Ave. Like more billions will flow in and like more dapps will come in and it'll be a forming galore. Like I'll be farming the hell out of avalanche.
01:41:28.814 - 01:42:10.390, Speaker C: I can't wait, man. You have no idea how excited I am. And you know what? Like, I keep trying to like check my own euphoria, but I keep trying to remind myself also that am I euphoric in this moment? Yes, but is that euphoria more like of a byproduct of what's already happened or just having the amount of conviction I do have about what is going to happen and soon? And I definitely think it's the latter. Having this amount of conviction, having seen this played out so many times, understanding exactly how this is going to play out, formulating a thesis, having a plan, it's very, very exciting. I haven't had this much fun since defi summer, really, if I'm going to be honest.
01:42:11.210 - 01:42:27.996, Speaker A: Yeah, it's so fun when you can transact for under a dollar because the cost of making a mistake on ETH is so high you just have to pay $100 or whatever. But everyone loves the ABM experience. It's, it's really fun.
01:42:28.148 - 01:43:01.790, Speaker B: It's seamless. I'm very much this the second Ave and curve launch. I'm going to have a lot of fun. But X Joe, that's my position. Yak, you got, you got me on that one. I don't see, I don't care about 1% return, 2345 6% return. I have a time horizon and I have no qualm having a decent time horizon and ill end up thinking of an ex Joe position, whether it ill wait for an entry, ill wait for a good by the fear moment.
01:43:01.790 - 01:43:21.860, Speaker B: But I wouldnt be thinking of liquidating it. Id be taking a position to purchase it. I own it. Its not for sale. Im buying a return, a weekly revenue stream. And thats something that I, thats the way I think about a lot of my value allocations.
01:43:23.920 - 01:43:44.300, Speaker C: I love that way of thinking because investing in something like Yak could definitely be thinking of hey, I have access to basically future yield as long as this ecosystem is in existence and im able to purchase that future yield for this static price. Its a really interesting way of thinking.
01:43:45.770 - 01:44:16.110, Speaker B: Yeah, it takes a lot. It's hard to get because it's hard to detach yourself from dollar denomination and to think you bought something. And I've had a curve position that's gone from 1.4 down to 600, back up to eight up to 1.6. The volatility will drive you nuts but you have to detach yourself. Volatility will drive you nuts.
01:44:17.530 - 01:44:49.808, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, yeah. To talk more bullish things about yak, it's just like, yeah, just because it's not inflationary. The downside is mitigated too right? Because if there is a sell off in the avalanche token or whatever, every farm token like Joe, PNG, Benky, I think they're not going to do as well as something like, you know, yeah. Just because if you are farming Joe or PNG, think about how much tokens you have and then think about how many tokens everyone else has. Right. And to many people these farms are just a revenue source.
01:44:49.808 - 01:45:25.992, Speaker A: Like I interviewed Cole Zero X from a VC firm and they're just like farming and dumping these farm tokens because that's how they make money. And at some point people will take money profits. And I think there's going to be some inelastic, I think the sell pressure for those farm tokens are going to be relatively inelastic. They're just going to sell when they can because just cash out to Avax or stablecoins. That's also one of the reasons that I think I like yak. Not only Messi, I know this, but Messi does more research than me. But if they turn on profit share I'll be bullish.
01:45:25.992 - 01:45:40.030, Speaker A: And I see yak on tVljdev. I mean yak is just a bet on avalanche TBO, right? And that's a, that's an amazing risk reward in my opinion. Like huge super plus 80 bet x.
01:45:40.070 - 01:46:12.680, Speaker B: Joe yak and Ave curve to build a free Avax position. I think, you see, I'm never early. I don't need to be early. I just, I need to find my path. And then bear in mind that the ex Joe and the Yak, those will be purchases. The liquidity thats transferable, pop it on aave get your debt. And you know that whole game you just borrow capital, you throw it on curve, and you get a free incentivized yield.
01:46:12.680 - 01:46:42.450, Speaker B: And youre building a free position so that you bridge back when the time is right. If volatility in the market and the amount of debt, the leverage peters down. And now youre following capital flow. Maybe capital flows back to Polygon, maybe capital flows back to l one. Maybe arbitram gets hot, maybe it doesnt. But you react to the market. Move your capital according to opportunity cost analysis.
01:46:42.450 - 01:46:51.150, Speaker B: Watch your downside exposed to upside and purchase revenue streams. Boys and girls out there in Defi land purchase them revenue streams.
01:46:52.730 - 01:47:27.030, Speaker A: So I have one question from Essie, because I know you have a pretty large bag of avalanche native tokens. What is your profit taking strategy? Because this is something that I consider, because when I was thinking about it, I didn't want to reduce. I took some profits on other tokens like PFi, Snowball, et cetera, but I still didn't want to, I still wanted exposure. So I just went into the safer bets like Avax and Yak. But let's say in the next, let's say our thesis plays out in September, how would you be taking profits?
01:47:27.850 - 01:48:02.860, Speaker C: Well, it's the same way. Basically the idea here is that no one can call bottoms and tops. That's a fool's errand. So the only way to actually exit here in this climate, like a king, is to dollar cost average out. It's very difficult to do that when the number is going up, much more difficult than you'd realize. It's much easier, in my opinion, to be a buyer than a seller, because when you're selling, you're not only selling the asset, you're not only realizing capital gains, you're selling your dreams. You're selling your dreams of making it.
01:48:02.860 - 01:48:49.960, Speaker C: If I sell, I'm not going to make it. So the way I plan on executing, and this is what I did with that run in Defi in February, although unfortunately, I got greedy and bought back in. But hey, it should happen, is to sell into the mania and to do it over time. I don't know how long the mania is going to last. I don't know how extreme the mania is going to get. And if I plan on averaging out over a period of maybe a month, maybe two, that, you know, that sets me up to be able to capture all of the upside, reduce my downside risk, not make a huge splash on any market. You know, I've already done that kind of initial rotation to quality.
01:48:49.960 - 01:49:24.492, Speaker C: I never rotated my P five because they've got a launch pad and I know launch pads are super hot, so I want to be able to have that access to the new shit that's coming out. Especially because there's no options for rotation right now. And having that portal, that access to the new shit, at least the no KYC news shit, I think could end up being free multiples just because people are dying to ape into something right now. We've already had these shit. It runs. This place works. There's money coming in.
01:49:24.492 - 01:49:59.690, Speaker C: We need some new shit to buy. So moving forward, trying to focus on those blue chips, the ones that we know are going to catch tailwinds like yak, like Joe. I think there's no reason to take unnecessary risks when you do have these blue chip incumbents that are going to do multiples anyway with deep liquidity. I want to have SoME exposure to the meme coin scene. The left carvers love coming in and buying the meme coins. And if this ecosystem really takes off and you get those retail flows, they're not coming to buy my yak bag. They're coming to buy my Dog coin.
01:49:59.690 - 01:50:18.960, Speaker C: They're coming to buy my apecoin. Whatever. So I do think it's important to have a bit of exposure to those, at least from my perspective, but primarily focused on the blue chips. There's no need to take unnecessary risks. There's going to be tons of OPportuniTy coming. Oh, my God. Yeah.
01:50:20.140 - 01:50:21.516, Speaker A: There is no second best.
01:50:21.588 - 01:50:41.140, Speaker C: No, no, to be honest. So that MEME, in my opinion, just like embodies, like the way I've been feeling the LaST WeeK, you know, and when I see Michael Saylor there, you know, I just. I feel like he's so focused, you know, he's so. He has this. Such a high degree of conviction. And he knows, because he's done his research, he knows that he can't lose. He's almost.
01:50:41.140 - 01:51:10.340, Speaker C: It's almost like he has seen the future. So that's exactly like how I feel right now. Like I'm onto something that, and other people don't realize it yet, but I'm 100% conviction to where I know that what I've done right now, while it may be seen as maybe even borderline insanity by a certain group, I know that it's not obvious. That's why I love that meme so much. When you see something that's so obvious and others don't, that's exactly what sailor faces right there.
01:51:12.520 - 01:51:13.440, Speaker B: So true.
01:51:13.600 - 01:51:14.500, Speaker A: It's the.
01:51:15.120 - 01:51:15.552, Speaker B: Oh, he's.
01:51:15.576 - 01:51:20.340, Speaker C: There's no second best. There is no second best. There is no second best.
01:51:20.760 - 01:51:35.780, Speaker B: He's. He's. He's spot on. Uh, he's very. He's obviously far out, but some of the smartest people in history are far out. But that's. That's not necessarily to be taken derogatory in a derogatory sense.
01:51:35.780 - 01:51:38.986, Speaker B: He's crazy. That's fucking awesome.
01:51:39.098 - 01:51:39.666, Speaker C: Yeah, I love.
01:51:39.698 - 01:51:40.410, Speaker B: That's awesome.
01:51:40.530 - 01:51:43.466, Speaker C: Well, Elon Musk is arguably fucking crazy.
01:51:43.498 - 01:51:44.270, Speaker B: Out of it.
01:51:44.610 - 01:51:47.986, Speaker C: Out of his goddamn mind. Steve jobs out of his goddamn mind.
01:51:48.058 - 01:51:59.914, Speaker A: You know, their minds just as insane, dude. Like, I mean, I love him. He made all of us so much money, but, like, these memes are insane. He's definitely.
01:51:59.962 - 01:52:27.858, Speaker B: Well, that's special, dude. Memes are everything. So the trends influence ideas. The transmission of just being able to convey an idea over a meme is meaningful. So I like to peer through the madness. I like to see things for what they are. And that photo and his presentation, whether it's in meme form or the original, he's extraordinary.
01:52:27.858 - 01:52:30.938, Speaker B: And he sees something that most do not, and that's meaningful.
01:52:31.114 - 01:52:36.090, Speaker C: I agree. Nothing. Nothing but respect for sailor, like, at all. Like, he is.
01:52:36.170 - 01:52:36.578, Speaker A: I love.
01:52:36.634 - 01:52:57.260, Speaker C: I love the fact that he has a vision, and that that vision, that conviction, is literally unshakable. You know, people make the joke that every single time Michael Saylor finds a quarter under his couch cushions, you know, he's going to buy more bitcoin to make it. Yeah. He's going to make an announcement about it, et cetera, et cetera. But, you know, like, that's.
01:52:57.300 - 01:53:11.420, Speaker B: That's the thing, is, he's not a bitcoin maxi. That might be a misconception. He's not a bitcoin maxi at all. Have. If you've ever. He talks about the four quadrants, you got. You dig in.
01:53:11.420 - 01:53:14.644, Speaker B: He's not. He is not a bitcoin maxi, which is absolutely fascinating.
01:53:14.692 - 01:53:18.132, Speaker C: I'll do some digging. I really am interested in hearing more about that.
01:53:18.316 - 01:53:37.800, Speaker B: He talks about the four quadrants, and he talks about everything that we're talking about today and avalanche and Defi and whatever, all of it. That's the tech, that's the infrastructure. And bitcoin is money. It's savings. It's your disinflationary asset where you store value. That's your goal. 2.0.
01:53:37.800 - 01:53:49.810, Speaker B: Maybe Google. A sailor in the four quadrants might show the video. It's one of his videos. He talks about it. Oh, Sven. Sven's video. Sven Hendrik.
01:53:50.270 - 01:54:14.948, Speaker A: Oh, that the perma doomer guy? Yeah. I feel like I feel like, like with the, like with people like Peter Schiff and like Michael Saylor, they're so extreme that like they kind of pigeonholed themselves to like be either only bitcoin or like never bitcoin at all because that's their like brand, right? That's their brand. But I feel like wrong, I feel like Schiff owns some bitcoin. I feel like how can you not own bitcoin?
01:54:15.084 - 01:54:46.196, Speaker B: Maybe I'm, maybe I'm, see, I don't understand. Just, just be open minded. Listen, I own gold, I own stocks. I don't understand. I have my distaste for stocks because they're all zombie companies and it's all negative yielding, it's all negative real yields, 3% or whatever Microsoft will give you -2% considering CPI inflation and whatever. I just, I don't understand why people are so against everything. I don't understand hating.
01:54:46.196 - 01:54:49.040, Speaker B: I don't understand that. Oh, I understand there's opportunity.
01:54:49.500 - 01:55:12.780, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so we're approaching in 2 hours. This has been a really good stream. Yeah. But I guess to wrap things up here, is there anything you want to say, parting words to my audience? Whether it be avalanche, crypto, or just defi in general, what do you want my audience to walk away with from this amazing livestream that we just had.
01:55:15.240 - 01:55:42.520, Speaker C: Very, very quickly? There's a lot of opportunity here. Being opportunity maximalist. And also with a lot of opportunity comes a lot of responsibility. Recognize that getting rich quick in a period of a few years, a few months, whatever, is still getting rich very quick. There's no reason to take unnecessary risks. Trying to get rich, trying to make it tomorrow. Bide your time, wait for opportunity.
01:55:42.520 - 01:56:24.730, Speaker C: When those good opportunities do present themselves, have conviction and go in and go hard. But most importantly, don't get rugged. You know, if you get rugged this early in the game chasing dumb shit, the opportunity cost of that could be catastrophic. So everybody just be safe. Dont just be aping into new liquidity pairings that just keep popping up right now. Its a very opportunistic environment right now because these scam developers know that people dont have anything to buy. And ive seen several of my friends get rugged already just trying to chase this momentum that doesnt necessarily exist.
01:56:24.730 - 01:56:50.650, Speaker C: Theres two many good things coming for you to take those risks. So everybody please be very, very careful and understand that once again, while you may be front running billions in inflows and that this is being vertically accumulated, so to speak, that there will be red days. You know, it's inevitable. So, you know, bide your time, wait for those opportunities, and when those opportunities present themselves, have the balls to execute.
01:56:51.190 - 01:57:06.708, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely got a. I. My first ever rugged happened on avalanche. I like, I made like, like a five x on husky. And then I rotated part of that to like, I forgot like Akita or something. And I got rugged, I got rugged.
01:57:06.804 - 01:57:08.516, Speaker C: I got rugged in Ava Kita as well.
01:57:08.628 - 01:57:09.588, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that one, that one.
01:57:09.604 - 01:57:10.680, Speaker C: Yeah, Ava kita.
01:57:11.060 - 01:57:17.440, Speaker A: I was so hyped about that one went to zero. Anyways, how about, you know, like what? Like parting words.
01:57:17.940 - 01:57:34.640, Speaker B: I never got rugged. Not once. Not even in Defi summer 2020. Go fucking figure. I don't know. I have deployed capital and I have gone for the asymmetric appreciation. I mean, it was like 15 acts on synthetics.
01:57:34.640 - 01:57:57.580, Speaker B: That shit was crazy. Those are my first three bags. Synthetix, Kyber and Bancor that just ripped like. Anyway, multiples. I leave your stream. Parting words of wisdom in my old age. My wisdom of 38 years being in this space for however long ive been by revenue streams.
01:57:57.580 - 01:58:20.314, Speaker B: And look, X Joe. Capital flows in billions. Flow in in five years time. Avalanche is a meaningful systemic significance. And it's cranking out returns. Well, two days, they buy back every two days and you have a revenue stream. And which means you have.
01:58:20.314 - 01:59:02.474, Speaker B: In five years, you have a salary. And that means you don't necessarily have to work if you've accumulated enough revenue streams. So while it's nice to have that big win, just remind yourself, like, if you put a thousand and you walk away with 50 grand, what the fuck you gonna do with 50 grandd? You're going to buy something? No, but if you're able to make five grand a week, you just bought your freedom. No one have to work. And to me that's everything. So I get philosophical with my stuff and freedom. People making a big windfall isn't necessarily freedom unless you know what to do with it.
01:59:02.474 - 01:59:33.246, Speaker B: Managing capital is more meaningful than that big windfall, so be careful. All the same sentiment is Messi. You guys know what you're talking about. So just watch your risk profile. Watch the rug, doctor. Time allows you to know if something has a decreased risk profile, which is obviously why core Ethereum l one has a decreased risk profile in many regards. Time tested for over a year and a half at this point.
01:59:33.246 - 01:59:59.052, Speaker B: So watch the capital inflow. It does make it a target, but it also, over time, allows a protocol to prove itself, but no reason not to capitalize. Just be safe, be smart, ask questions. All three of us are on Twitter, ask the questions and we're all happy to help because as I say on my stream, we can do better. Always.
01:59:59.236 - 02:00:11.076, Speaker A: Yeah. And I provided a link to Noah Messi, their Twitter pages, as well as Noah's YouTube channel and herolabs. Right. Do you want to talk about hero Labs, Messi, just to wrap things up?
02:00:11.108 - 02:00:11.564, Speaker B: Sure, sure.
02:00:11.612 - 02:00:57.074, Speaker C: Briefly, Hero Labs is basically just a branch of the hero ecosystem to where we're attempting to have kind of all in one media channel to where we cover a variety of topics with a variety of people. Of course, people have their own brands and are very successful with those brands, but there's not really a hub that I know of yet to where you have all sorts of different content being discussed in one place. And that's what we're trying to build out and that's what we're trying to do. Hero, for those of you that aren't aware, that's Hxro. That's what's behind me. We're building a decentralized options framework on Solana. Some major players involved in that.
02:00:57.074 - 02:01:19.414, Speaker C: Super interesting. Not going to shill it, just go check it out if decentralized options does suit your fancy. But for sure, come check out hero Labs. There's all sorts of experience there. Analysts, we have options reports coming soon. More and more and more. Our options reports are already available, you know, in text format.
02:01:19.414 - 02:01:39.678, Speaker C: But we have a really smart woman who's working with us now that's actually like been on the news, like really, really like Bloomberg and that kind of stuff. And we look forward to bringing her content in as well soon. So check us out. You know, I think you might find you like it or maybe you hate it, but that's your choice.
02:01:39.854 - 02:01:49.332, Speaker A: And if there's any, if there's ever like a must watch show that comes up every week, I'd say it's. It's messy as shitcoin church.
02:01:49.516 - 02:01:50.636, Speaker B: Yes, it is.
02:01:50.828 - 02:02:03.760, Speaker C: I like, I like to let loose, you know, I'm an absolute joker and clown, you know, and I enjoy being silly. So, you know, if you. If you like those kinds of things, you know, you'll find that on my shouldcoin church show. Yeah. Like that.
02:02:04.420 - 02:02:05.956, Speaker B: Spectacular. It is.
02:02:06.028 - 02:02:06.396, Speaker A: Yeah.
02:02:06.468 - 02:02:08.036, Speaker C: Hey, there we go.
02:02:08.228 - 02:02:33.570, Speaker A: Yeah, there we go. Well, yeah, so it's been 2 hours of lots of alpha, lots of, I guess, opinions and thoughts shared. Yeah. I think we're all bullish at Avalanche for the obvious reasons. I'd say 10 billion tbo coming in the next month or so with all being curved deploying. So, yeah, check out Messi Sharecoin church. He went over like the entire avalanche ecosystem in the past.
02:02:33.570 - 02:03:07.386, Speaker A: Yeah, in his two hour stream my channel has a bunch of avalanche videos and Noah, I'm sure he'll start talking about avalanche in his daily livestream that he does every morning. I believe so, yeah. Thank you guys for watching. Let me know in the comment section if you want me to do this type of content more. Usually I do live streams on Sundays just by myself doing presentations. But I'd be happy to bring on more guests like Messi, like Noah who share the same mentality as me when it comes comes to crypto defi, et cetera. And I think, yeah, let me know in the comment section below.
02:03:07.386 - 02:03:10.710, Speaker A: So thank you for watching. Thank you for watching. Have a good one out there.
02:03:11.810 - 02:03:20.130, Speaker B: All right, guys, let's do this more. Tyke, you got good content and you're the one inch of.
