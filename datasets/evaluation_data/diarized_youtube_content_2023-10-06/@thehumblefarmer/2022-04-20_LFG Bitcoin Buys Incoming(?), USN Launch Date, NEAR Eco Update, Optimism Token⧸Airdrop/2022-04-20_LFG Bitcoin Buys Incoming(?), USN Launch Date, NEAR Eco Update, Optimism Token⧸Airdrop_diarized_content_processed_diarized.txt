00:00:00.840 - 00:00:21.450, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. Welcome to the market update for this week. I was busy on Monday and I wasn't feeling that great Tuesday. So I'm just making this video today. But we have a lot of content to cover, so let's get right into it. We'll start this video with a little bit of a pop quiz, right? If you've enrolled in the Taiki school of humble farming, then you should know the answer. You should know the answer to this question.
00:00:21.450 - 00:00:40.380, Speaker A: But you know, I have to test you guys, right? Once in a while. So spot something bullish here. Okay. And tell me the reason why. I'll give you 10 seconds. Just think of it in your head and let's see if you get it right. I mean, I guess there's like, not much to look into, so it's not that difficult.
00:00:40.380 - 00:01:13.598, Speaker A: But I guess, like the bullish thing here, right, is if you look down here, we see that UST has half a billion dollars, right, in this ust three pool on curve, whereas three curve has $800 million. So it's unbalanced by roughly $300 million. And this is bullish the entire market. Well, it's bullish, Luna and BTC. But obviously anything that's bullish BTC is going to be incrementally bullish the rest of the market. Right, because bitcoin kind of dictates the health of the entire market. And this is because of how the Luna foundation guard and how they purchase bitcoin.
00:01:13.598 - 00:02:01.690, Speaker A: You know, like how they actually acquire bitcoin, right? Because they can't just mint USD at a thin air and use that USD to buy bitcoin with it. There has to be a mechanism in place where they can only buy bitcoin when there's an increased demand for UST, which is kind of what's happening here. Actually, if you look at it right now, it's even more unbalanced. There is $453 million at the UST and $850 million with the three curve. So it's unbalanced by $400 million. So going back to this post from March 9 by the LFG, they've mentioned that whenever they, or I guess the only way they can buy bitcoin is when the curve pool is unbalanced. So they can mint USD, dump it into the USD three curve, and then withdraw us, sorry, withdraw USDC or tether from the other side.
00:02:01.690 - 00:02:36.186, Speaker A: So what they can do, because it's unbalanced by $400 million, they can dump $200 million with the USD and withdraw $200 million with a three curve, and voila, it's balanced again. And with that $200 million, they can buy more bitcoin. So far, they've acquired roughly $1.75 billion in bitcoin, and they haven't purchased bitcoin in, like, nine and a half days. So I don't know what's up with that. But, you know, just imagine a scenario in the future. Maybe it's tomorrow, maybe it's a week from now, where do Kwan? Comes out of his gate, out of his cave, and is like, all right, bears are fucked again.
00:02:36.186 - 00:02:55.426, Speaker A: I'm going shopping. You know, let's go, let's go, let's go. Die will die by my hand. Right? So, you know, I think that's gonna be incrementally bullish at the end of the day, right? You know, they have half a billion dollars, and it's gonna go up, like, you know, three quarters of a billion of dollars. It's not that much by pressure. Right. But it's all about the narrative, right? It's all about the bull posting.
00:02:55.426 - 00:03:33.230, Speaker A: You know, we love the bull posting around here, so just strong narratives there. Okay. Yeah. And I guess it's also, like, incrementally bullish Luna, too, because the reason the curve pool is unbalanced is because there's, like, a lot of demand for UST, right? It just means that market participants have been buying a lot of UST and swapping USDC or USDT for USD. And you can kind of see the burn rate there. I sold some Luna two weeks ago just because, you know, like, whenever USN got announced and, you know, the burn rate kind of was slowing down. But, you know, Luna always proves me wrong or USD always proves me wrong, I guess.
00:03:33.230 - 00:04:08.296, Speaker A: And it's just burning a lot of USD here. Right? Yeah. Okay, so speaking of which, let's kind of go over Nier, right, in USN because, I mean, this article. I talked about this article last week or two weeks ago, whenever I did. So, yeah, I think last week about the future is near. An investment thesis by Mister Zoran Cole, Captain Cole. And he kind of dropped the bomb last week or, you know, 14 days ago when he mentioned that, you know, Nier is going to announce the launch of their own native algo stablecoin, USN, in partnership with other well capitalized stable coins.
00:04:08.296 - 00:04:55.000, Speaker A: They're going to offer, you know, 20% APR, roughly, which will ignite defi capital rotation into the near ecosystem, siphoning tbl from other alt lithe protocols. And I kind of agree. Right. The thing is, I mean, Captain Cole, who isn't really affiliated with Nier, mentioned this, and the near foundation never confirmed this. So, you know, I was always operating under the assumption that this was true, but always, I guess, kind of careful because, you know, the near foundation never confirmed it, but today it was confirmed. And I guess, like, the one thing that people got too hyped on was that, you know, I guess, like, I thought it was going to launch today, but looking back on this article, he mentioned that Nirvol announced the launch of their native Algo stablecoin. So that's kind of what happened.
00:04:55.000 - 00:05:22.240, Speaker A: So decentral bank, which is going to be the issuer of USN, that's confirmed, just posted this. Right. USN is near April something, 2022. So it's not today. It's going to be sometime in the next nine days, you know, because either the 21st or the 22nd, 29th, whatever, right. Given how the near foundation works, right. They're more of like a web two company that's trying to, you know, create a more user friendly experience for web3.
00:05:22.240 - 00:05:55.776, Speaker A: So given that, I don't think they're gonna like, you know, launch something like on a Thursday or Friday, I think it's gonna. It's more likely that they launch something earlier next week or something. But I mean, to be honest, I have no idea. But I guess, I mean, this isn't technically a delay, right? Know, I mean, I guess Zorn Cole was correct in that, you know, it was announced, but, you know, April 20 something. I still think it's going to be a bullish catalyst for Nier. Right. The 20% is still unconfirmed, but given that, you know, he got this thing, right, I'm assuming that the 20% is correct as well.
00:05:55.776 - 00:06:30.090, Speaker A: But we'll see. I think 20% yield on now go stable coin. That's going to be an over collateralized to begin with. It's going to be considered to be safe by the market as long as it's backed by. I mean, they raised a bunch of money from VC's, right? So it's going to be like backed by jump crypto, three ac and whatnot. And whatever your thoughts are on algo stablecoins, it doesn't really matter, right? Money will still flow into the ecosystem, and when money flows into the ecosystem, the TVL of the ecosystem grows. It creates like a bullish sentiment, like a narrative, right.
00:06:30.090 - 00:07:01.016, Speaker A: For it. It's like, oh, my God, TvL is going up. I'll pump my bags. Right. Just because USN goes up doesn't mean that all coins are going to go up, but crypto is driven on narratives. If USN reaches a multibillion dollar market cap over the next couple of months or so, it's still going to be a bullish catalyst. And speaking of, I guess, non bullish catalysts, there's been this rumor of this vesting schedule on the 22 April of like a 1% unlock.
00:07:01.016 - 00:07:46.564, Speaker A: So I don't know why this is a thing now. It's being shared by a lot of people, and I think it came from this account. And I think they admitted that they were wrong on this or, you know, they posted this without confirming it. But Kendo confirmed this, where, you know, there isn't going to be a 1% unlock on the 22 April because these near unlocks, right, from seed investors and whatnot. It's unlocked linearly every single block, right? So yes, investors are getting tokens every single day, right? Every single second. But it's not going to be like April 22. A bunch of tokens land into the hands of investors and they're going to dump on us, right? If they wanted to dump on us, they can do it now, right? They don't have to do it the 22nd or the 23rd.
00:07:46.564 - 00:08:15.660, Speaker A: They can do it now if they wanted to. So I'm not saying that the unlocks are false. It's happening every day, but it's not like, you know, it's not a cliff. You can actually confirm this in this new year article, right? Tokens apply and distribution. This kind of goes over, like the linear vesting schedule, right? That Nier goes through. And I can link this in the description, but, you know, if the VC's want to dump on us, they'll dump on us now, right? Or to see the investors or whoever participated. So April 22 isn't really a significant date.
00:08:15.660 - 00:08:40.754, Speaker A: But, you know, maybe. I mean, who knows, right? Maybe they will dump on us. Who knows? There's no way for me now. Okay. Lastly, there has been more news about incentives for the near and aurora ecosystem. Proximity labs, which is a defi incubator for, like, near and aura, right under the, like, I guess like that's under, like, the near foundation umbrella. They gave a grant to bastion, right? More money for bastion.
00:08:40.754 - 00:09:22.740, Speaker A: And they mentioned that expect some juicy near aura rewards over the next few weeks. So that's happening. And also origami, which is the other compound fork on the aurora ecosystem, I guess, got $2.5 million worth of new rewards and they're going to be distributing this in the next couple of weeks. Right from the 22 April to the 6 May and they're going to be giving this out to depositors, right? So if you lend out your assets, you're going to get these tokens and assuming that the current TVL, right, current liquidity, they're going to estimate roughly 14% to 42% APR for nearest. So if you go to the application, obviously these rewards aren't live yet. But on top of these aprs, right, these deposit aprs.
00:09:22.740 - 00:10:06.604, Speaker A: So let's just look into USDC. On top of 4% USDC and a bunch of these ply tokens, you're going to receive 14% to 42% in there. So humble farmer thesis money markets that are trusted with incentive programs that should drive more TvL into the ecosystem. It's kind of been happening, right? If you actually check, I guess like the entire divi llama, right, TvL growth near is outperforming, right? Most chains. I thought aura was gonna hit a billion dollars TvL in, what is this in q one? But I think with the Russia Ukraine invasion it kind of delayed these launches from happening. But no, I guess I was wrong on that. But I'm still holding strong, I guess.
00:10:06.604 - 00:10:48.994, Speaker A: And I guess compared to the ecosystem, right. When I first started covering near and early this, sorry, early January, I mean there's actually a lot of applications now. I mean like to be honest, like none of these applications are like, you know, that amazing, right? At least not yet, right? Maybe it will be at some time in the future. And I never expected like you know, some crazy killer app to launch on Aurora, right? I just expected like TVL growth on aura through these incentive programs. And USN is an incentive program, right? Because it's going to be subsidized by VC's anchor, right? USD Luna is an incentive program, right? Because it's subsidized. So incentive programs doesn't necessarily have to mean like you know, like literal near tokens into your wallets. It can just be in the form of like subsidized stablecoin yields.
00:10:48.994 - 00:11:40.116, Speaker A: And I guess the benefits that these new l ones have is that they can look back into like what happened in the like the past twelve months and adjust how they distribute incentives, you know, like by studying what happened before. If you go back to my video that I recorded with Luigi from Eva labs, I think like August or September, he mentioned that. Yeah. Like they've studied how matic did it, right? How Polygon distributed their like $150 million into the program and they took their took, took their learnings and applied it to avalanche. Rush and Avalanche is a legitimate ecosystem. And similarly, I think the Nier team, right, and the Nier foundation studied what happened for avalanche Polygon Luna, and was like, okay, we're going to take some, some, I guess, influence of like how USC and Luna did it. We're also going to take, I guess, how learnings from like how evil apps did it.
00:11:40.116 - 00:12:05.642, Speaker A: And then bam, we're going to start, you know, giving out money to people. Hopefully that brings more TBL into the ecosystem. And as TBL grows into the ecosystem, it's going to increase velocity, right. Within the ecosystem. More transactions going to happen, more wallets are going to be created, you know, so that's a kind of the humble former thesis. And you can kind of see this in the bridging data, right, for it's okay. I mean, I mean it's more green than red, right.
00:12:05.642 - 00:12:40.256, Speaker A: But like the total dollar value isn't that much, to be honest. But you know, it's green, right? That's all I care about. So there's that, okay, another incentive program, right, that is happening right now. Right now is on avalanche, right? This is Aave V three. If you've been using Aave on avalanche, you're probably using V two. And I think the V two incentives got deprecated and all the rewards are going to V three. So these rewards are pretty good, right? So, you know, aura isn't the only chain with like good incentive programs.
00:12:40.256 - 00:13:02.898, Speaker A: Avalanche is still, you know, giving out tokens. So if you're interested in these rates, you know, I would suggest you look into them and, you know, these are pretty great given like 3.23 billion TVL. So no, it's not going to get diluted anymore or any further. I don't know when this is going to end. But, you know, still pretty good aprs. Lastly, I kind of touch on optimism, right? The ETH l two token.
00:13:02.898 - 00:13:27.206, Speaker A: I still think EtH L2 is a meme, right? You know, the technology still isn't ready yet. I remember back in like March of last year, right? Over a year ago, actually. They were like, okay, guys, like, we're going to launch optimism soon. Like, you know, like next week. Let's get ready. And then it's like April 2022 and there still isn't that much activity in optimism, to be honest. That's fine.
00:13:27.206 - 00:14:31.186, Speaker A: And we all know that at some point further into the development of ETH L2, it's going to be a thriving ecosystem. It's going to lock up probably 1011 figures in tv, all at some point, but right now, there's not that much activity. Ask yourself, who do you know? Do you know anyone that uses optimism or arbitrum actively? Like, I'm in. I'm deep into the crypto space, and I can't even, like, count, like, five people that, like, actively use optimism, arbitrum, you know? But I know a bunch of people that, like, use arbitram and whatnot. Right. So I think one of the problems that ETH L2 has is they don't really have a token, right? There's no incentive program, so there really isn't an incentive for people like you and I to bridge over to awkward german optimism, especially because the fees on arbitrum and optimism is much higher than arbitrum. Sorry, avalanche or Aurora, but I can't see a bullish catalyst rate, because if you scroll down to this new chapter aspect, they mentioned that we're nearing the end of the chapter and beginning of the next one.
00:14:31.186 - 00:14:44.750, Speaker A: Driven by community ownership and governance, it's fast approaching. More on this soon. So this definitely means that they're gonna have a token. It's. They're probably gonna airdrop it. I would assume that they've already taken snapshots. So if you.
00:14:44.750 - 00:15:21.316, Speaker A: I still suggest, you know, if you haven't done so bridging to optimism just to, you know, maybe be eligible, maybe do a few swaps and whatnot. But, you know, if I was optimism, I would take the snapshot and then say this. So I would say maybe that's like, a less than a 10% chance that they're gonna, you know, they haven't taken a snapshot, but, you know, I would still do it, right. Just to test it out. And I feel like everyone should expect this, right. I think optimism, of course, this is basically confirmed. And I think arbitrum will also have a token, because if you think about, you know, VC's in crypto, right? For example, Andreessen Horowitz and other VC's, I think, paradigm.
00:15:21.316 - 00:15:44.728, Speaker A: Yeah, paradigm in it. Andreessen Horowitz, a 16 Z. They've poured a lot of money into optimism. $150 million, right? Back in March 2022, at a $1.65 billion valuation. So you have to think about, how are these VC's gonna make money, right? Because unless this is, like, an equity investment and they're gonna IPo at some point, or, you know, they're gonna, like, transfer equity, like sell equity and whatnot. Like, you can't really make money.
00:15:44.728 - 00:16:11.588, Speaker A: So you should. You should always expected a token to launch for Optimus and arbitram. So I don't really know how they're gonna launch or whatnot. But if they launch at, like, you know, roughly like, $2 billion fully daily valuation, I feel like it's gonna be a really good buy. I really doubt that. Right. Given that, given the valuation of ETH right now and the valuation of alternative l ones, you know, it ranges from, like, ten to $40 billion, I would expect them to, you know, launch at those valuations.
00:16:11.588 - 00:16:45.148, Speaker A: And given that, you know, even Optimus and arbitrum, they use EtH is gas. I'm not really sure where the demand for these tokens are going to come from. Maybe they're going to be a bunch of, I guess, incentives and I guess, like, liquidity pools that are going to use, like, the optimism tokenization. Who knows? But if you're bullish on EtH l two, right, this is definitely good news. And, you know, if, you know, if optimism has incentive programs and, like, quality applications, I'll definitely bridge. I'll definitely use it. I'll definitely, you know, like, you know, try it out for right now, there's really no point, right, other than bridging it, hopefully to get a snapshot.
00:16:45.148 - 00:17:00.816, Speaker A: So that's about it. That's all I wanted to cover. You know, I'm just paid. Like, wait, sorry. I'm just waiting patiently on near usna. I feel like I've been farming here for so long. So, you know, like, who knows? I don't necessarily think we're, like, that early anymore.
00:17:00.816 - 00:17:15.232, Speaker A: You know, it's. I feel like. I feel like three, four months ago, like, no one was talking about it. And, like, now people have, like, you know, like, $100 price targets or something. There's my exit liquidity, I guess. But let's talk about narratives. No, to be honest.
00:17:15.232 - 00:17:44.496, Speaker A: Like, these light tail ones they have can definitely be strong tailwinds or heavy tailwinds. But, you know, I was wrong on, like, the London foundation where buying bitcoin, like, being like that, being, like, a super strong narrative. I mean, it was a strong narrative, but, you know, the market dumped. But you can also argue that if they weren't buying bitcoin, right, bitcoin would be, like, a much lower valuation right now. So, I mean, it's definitely, like, incrementally. I mean, there's no way this is, like, bearish, right? At least in the short term, E 2.0 emerged.
00:17:44.496 - 00:18:04.452, Speaker A: I mean, people were talking about this being this, coming in, like, June or something, but now people are saying August, September, October. I wouldn't be surprised because like 2023. But you know, there is confluence, right, with optimism. Launching a token ETH 2.0 coming sometime soon. Coinbase NFT beta launching Solana, right. Having opensea and whatnot.
00:18:04.452 - 00:18:40.310, Speaker A: Actually Solana, there's like no connection there, so that doesn't make any sense. But E 2.0, I don't think it's priced in the, I think it's gonna be one of those things where like, you know, two months before it's gonna be super hyped up, it's gonna be a solid news. So whatever profits that I have right on my other place, I'm most likely gonna rotate it into Eth stables and nfts. I'm looking into nfts more, but that's a topic for another video in the future. And USN 20% is still unconfirmed, but, you know, I'm assuming it's gonna be correct. And I think this is gonna be super strong given that anchor rates are gonna lower on May 1, most likely.
00:18:40.310 - 00:19:30.618, Speaker A: I don't think this is bearish USD by any means, right? I mean, if you just look at that data, right, they're still like burning a bunch of UST and obviously UST has more Lindy, it's been around longer. So 18% on anchor versus 20% on, like, USN. I still think some money will flow into anchor, but I do think that incremental dollars, right, so imagine if a trader like, makes $100,000. Maybe prior to USN launching, all of that would have gone into anchor, but maybe now some of that, like maybe 80% goes into USN and 20%, you know, like you kind of get what I'm talking about. So I don't think people are going to leave anchor, right, to go to USN because you have to pay bridging fees. You know, it's not really worth, you know, the incremental 2% really isn't worth it. But I still think USN is going to hit like a multi billion dollar market cap over the next couple of months.
00:19:30.618 - 00:20:05.776, Speaker A: I don't really know how it's going to launch. I don't really know how the minting mechanism going to go because I know UST, I think the max mint for UST per day is like somewhere in the low nine figures, right? Maybe $100 to $200 million, I'm assuming with. Because USN is so new, it's going to grow at a slower pace. But, you know, if USDN, right from waves can get to a billion dollar market cap, then I feel like USN, which is like much more well capitalized with much stronger back or a stronger team can easily hit at least like two 3 billion. But I don't have a time frame on that. Nothing else has changed. I added this.
00:20:05.776 - 00:20:57.804, Speaker A: The Crobata bots driving avalanche gas. If you go to snow trace, the avalanche block Explorer on any given day, like roughly 30% to 60% of transactions are coming from Crobata. And it's kind of disincentivizing people like myself, especially if you have a smaller wallet from using that landscape changes because it's a expensive, and when I say expensive, it's only like a few dollars. Right. Depending on, depending on the complexity of the smart contract. But you know, it is what it is. I feel like this isn't really like bearish, right? In fact you can also argue this to be bullish because this kind of shows you like how important subnets are, right? Defi Kingdoms train having its own subnet because once Krobata has gets its own subnet in early May, all that activity is going to go into the crobata subnet which is going to free up a lot of block space for DeFi users on the C chain.
00:20:57.804 - 00:21:10.764, Speaker A: So I just have it here. Right. Just because, you know, I just feel like less people are going to use avalanche, you know, because all that block space is going to the bots. But you know, just here. Right. To be honest, like, I don't think this is even a headwind. Right.
00:21:10.764 - 00:21:32.314, Speaker A: I still think avalanche is a really good chain, you know, scaling horizontally via subnets. No, I think that, you know, application specific blockchains. I like it. Right. All right, so that's the end of the video. Hopefully do Kwon starts blow posting, right? You know, like I missed those blow posts, right? I really miss those blow posts. So like, you know, hopefully, hopefully he starts it again and.
00:21:32.314 - 00:21:50.890, Speaker A: Yeah, so yeah, thank you guys for watching. Let me. Did I miss anything? I don't think I missed anything. Yeah, I'll link a bunch of things in the description below so, you know, you won't in case you want to check for these things yourself. But thank you guys for watching and have informant out there and yeah.
