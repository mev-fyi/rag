00:00:01.200 - 00:00:17.638, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. Welcome to the state of Defi report for February 7. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. Link to the premium discord is in the description below as well. So 2023 has certainly been a very eventful year, you know? Yeah. So we'll get right into it.
00:00:17.638 - 00:00:52.034, Speaker A: Right? I have many thoughts on this topic in terms of the things that's been popping up so far as well as like, my performance, but we'll get right into that. Financial advice. These are my thoughts as of February 7. So if you're watching this video a week from now, my thoughts have changed. I hold GMX, FXs and Xmon really haven't changed. And you know, looking back to, I guess like the past seven months, I really haven't done anything right. Basically I thought the bottom was in July because post three ac, I thought that level of selling cannot be matched, right? Celsius, Voyager, three ac, yadda yadda yadda.
00:00:52.034 - 00:01:34.952, Speaker A: Of course I was incorrect because FTX, right, that put in new lows for BTC and various other altcoins, but it put in higher lows or it did not put in your lows for ETh. So maybe I was like partially correct, but it doesn't really matter, right? Basically, my mindset since July of last year was just, okay, this is going to be the time to accumulate. I'm going to just buy altcoins and majors and things I like, and I have to do so with the mindset of just at least hold it for like a year or like, you know, it's like a multi month time horizon. Because I have no idea when the bull market's gonna be back. I have no idea when capital is gonna flow. So the best thing I can do is just slowly allocate to the things I like and just let it ride. And that's been my mindset, just let everything ride.
00:01:34.952 - 00:02:00.396, Speaker A: I really haven't thought about selling. I'm just in like just Hodl mode, I guess. I mean, I don't wanna say that because, you know, I have to sell at some point, right? And like, you know, de risk and whatnot. But, you know, I think everyone has 2022 PTSD. I mean, I certainly do too. And I feel like I have to like shift my brain a little bit because I think there's a reasonable chance that, you know, November was the bottom. And I mean, I'm certainly positioned for November to be the bottom.
00:02:00.396 - 00:02:45.774, Speaker A: And, you know, when the facts change or the data changes, I have to pivot. But, you know, I think we're all in crypto for the multiples that it can give us. And if you don't really have high conviction in some of the coins you hold, if you're just trying to play quick narratives, flips. Right. I mean, if you're good at things like that, I think, you know, you should do so, right. I mean, you know, money is money, but for me, I still have a little bit of trouble pivoting to just like, the Yolo narrative trader mindset. And, I mean, this kind of makes me sound conservative, but you can argue that, like, my portfolio is pretty decent because cash actually today after, you know, GMX and FXS went up is actually, like the lowest position right now in my portfolio, even though that wasn't really the case, like, you know, two weeks ago.
00:02:45.774 - 00:03:48.670, Speaker A: So I'm pretty allocated, but, you know, how I'm allocated it is up to question. And, you know, I really have to reevaluate in the coming weeks, coming months, but maybe even that slower because crypto moves so fast. And I feel like 2022, you know, there was, like, no need for anyone to move fast because things were just going down. But when things start to pick up, when things start to go up, I feel like we have all, you all have to, you know, feel kind of rushed, right. And even I feel this level of imposter syndrome where I'm like, okay, like, what am I doing? Like, are my views on the market incorrect? How are they incorrect? Why are they incorrect? Does it just need time? So I, you know, I toggle with these questions every single day, every single week, especially because I'm so, like, transparent with, like, everything I do. And, you know, like that, that also opens me to criticism, which, you know, is basically the criticism that people have is like, my biggest altcoin position is Exxon. And it's been, I mean, it's up like two x this year, but from where it was previously, it's not really doing that well.
00:03:48.670 - 00:04:13.632, Speaker A: And compared to things like Kanto liquid staking derivatives, like random arbitrage coins, it's. I really feel like I'm misallocated. But I'll talk about all those gags later down the line. So, you know, I think one thing I think we're all looking for is some form of a pullback. I mean, literally, we've been up only, right. I think the biggest pullback was like six or 7%, not even like a 10%. And.
00:04:13.632 - 00:04:53.610, Speaker A: But, you know, I think we all know that it's coming. But, you know, you also think about market psychology, right? If everyone thinks it's coming and if everyone is, like, willing to buy the pullback, then chances are, you know, people are positioned to buy a pullback. They have some cash that they're willing to deploy, and if the markets keep going up, then they're gonna be forced to buy. And, you know, that's kind of what we see because crypto is very reflexive, which we will talk about later down the line or later in the video. So I think one sign that we would like to see is some fud happen, leading to price of bitcoin eritrea going down and then having that dip bot up immediately. A lot of people compare the market structure now to that of 2019. People call it the echo bubble, the four year cycle.
00:04:53.610 - 00:05:26.150, Speaker A: Whatever it is, I don't think it really matters. It just play the market. But back in April of 2019, April 25, the New York prosecutors alleged that Biffnex covered almost a billion dollar loss using tether funds. And this obviously caused some bud, and it led to the price of bitcoin going down by roughly 14% in a couple of days. Obviously, in hindsight, right, like that dip got bought up in, like ten days, and we were putting in new local highs afterwards. And this is a sign of a strong market in bear markets. Sorry, bear markets bottom on bad news.
00:05:26.150 - 00:06:12.056, Speaker A: Because if there's bad news and it doesn't bring in incremental sellers, then chances are there are not that many sellers left. And on a similar note, if good news does not bring in higher prices, that tends to mark a top. Because if there are no incremental buyers on good news, then chances are there are no more incremental buyers. And honestly, because we're so low in terms of price points in crypto, I think the biggest signal that we can look at is whenever there's bad news, is it going to be bought up? And so far it's been the case. In the case of the Genesis bankruptcy, I think price pulled back like 6% immediately, just went up. The screenshots a little outdated, but prices are roughly in the same area now. And I think yesterday or two days ago, there was the finance banking FuD, and there's the DCG, Genesis FuD.
00:06:12.056 - 00:06:32.962, Speaker A: Oh, my God, they're going to unwind GPTC BTC to five k. But it sounds like it's not going to happen. And I feel like a lot of people were looking into Genesis as the last domino to fall. But if that last domino isn't falling, or even if the fall is delayed like a couple years. The crypto doesn't really care about that. Right. And in the short term, what matters to price is the marginal buyers and sellers.
00:06:32.962 - 00:06:51.070, Speaker A: And obviously, for certain narratives, there are a lot more buyers. Right. There are a lot more buyers than sellers. And like I mentioned, I'm in this let it Ryan mindset. I am definitely underperforming, like, the narrative traders. I think for me, I think I am. Because I'm just like, so long.
00:06:51.070 - 00:07:33.168, Speaker A: Yeah, because I'm just so long. I feel like, I mean, so long is kind of relative, right? Maybe I'm like, not that long, but in my mind I'm pretty long. I feel like I'm up. I'm definitely outperforming, right, like the average person, but in terms of, like, the amount of risk I'm taking on, I'm definitely underperforming, right. I feel like I'm probably, like, in the 20th percentile in terms of, you know, given the amount of risk that this, whatever person is taking, the expected return should be much higher than whatever I've gained so far. And that's definitely frustrating, and I need to get better at that. And, you know, maybe I'm, like, too slow to act or maybe, you know, I should be patient.
00:07:33.168 - 00:07:59.466, Speaker A: I mean, these questions, right? We ask ourselves every day, there's so much fomo that happens, and I feel like the markets are really. Yeah, the markets are really good at making you feel bad for missing pumps. I mean, I definitely feel bad, right. Because, you know, that's kind of my thing. I try to catch things, but, you know, I think it's fine. I think we're all working on our own timeline. My personal timeline is like multi month, but in the short term, it's like, oh, my God, like, everything's pumping.
00:07:59.466 - 00:08:45.556, Speaker A: Like, what do I do? So I'm kind of sticking to my strategy so far, right? That maximizes my sleep adjusted returns and, you know, like my strategy, probably different from your strategy. Everyone should, like, you know, try to have their own timeline. You don't have to, you know, outperform all the traders because, I mean, that's impossible. And most people, like, end up over trade and, you know, get wrecked in, like, gas slippage fees, Dex fees and whatnot. But maybe I'm just coping, right, because I hold a bunch of exmon. Maybe this is my version of Stockholm syndrome where I'm justifying holding certain things because it will one day pump, but if it never pumps, then what am I doing? One data point I want to share with you is stablecoin flows. So this is for centralized stablecoins, USDC, tether and busd.
00:08:45.556 - 00:09:33.142, Speaker A: I think it's a good indicator for retail sentiment because if money or if centralized stablecoin market caps are going down, then chances are people are bridging USDC and, like, whatever back to fiat because they hate crypto, right? They don't want to buy crypto. They want to sell crypto. But if money is flowing back, then chances are people are bridging fiat to centralized exchanges to either coins or to bridge onto the chain to use DeFi or nfts. And I started tracking this after FTX and in the month of November, very rare, right. People just leave, leaving money out of the ecosystem. Like, I'm in like some crypto og chats and after FTX, like, you know, someone, like the ogs were just literally pulling USDC out, like, into their bank accounts because they just did not trust it anymore. And now these people are trying to frantically bridge back.
00:09:33.142 - 00:10:06.718, Speaker A: So I feel like that's definitely, like, in the stage of the cycle we're in, I still feel like people are still trying to figure out how to position. So I think there are naturally going to be, like, more inflows into the markets than outflows. But we'll see. Right? So November pretty bad. December also bad, right? Just sentiment really bad. Nothing's happening. But I think one thing I mentioned, like, last month was like, or, you know, in December was chances are crypto teams are waiting for, like, the new year to, like, launch stuff because if some coin pumps in December, then people might sell it for, like, tax purposes.
00:10:06.718 - 00:10:42.114, Speaker A: But if something comes in January, then, you know, there's, like, less reasons to sell and, like, when. Right. But, you know, we kind of saw this issue just like, you know, on social media and stuff. But December, pretty bad. The first week of January, also bad. But I think that's when Lido started, like going up two x, you know, like various narratives started popping up and then following, you know, the second week of January, you know, you can, I mean, these numbers aren't that big, but you can kind of see like a trend shift, right? Like November, December just very red. And then in January or in the latter half of January and beyond, we're starting to see more green days.
00:10:42.114 - 00:11:12.432, Speaker A: So I think this is a positive sign if you're a bull. And I'm definitely monitoring this and saying, hey, like, this is good, right? This is good for my bags or maybe not all my bags, but some of my bags. So in terms of my report, card. I'll probably give myself a c or c or something. I think. I've had this letter ride mindset and just accumulate things since July of last year, which is good, but maybe I should have been more nimble. But also, like I mentioned, I feel like it's just best to work on your own timeline.
00:11:12.432 - 00:11:33.580, Speaker A: I just feel like, because I'm almost, like, 24/7 into the space, I just, like, you know, kick myself for underperforming. But I think that's fine, right? I mean, we should all do our own thing. Biggest altcoin bag is xmon. Gross. But I'll talk about, like, my bull case for it in the latter half of the video. This is like a play for me for. Yeah, I'll talk about that later.
00:11:33.580 - 00:12:08.998, Speaker A: Actually missing out on narratives. Not happy, but I'm okay with it. You know, if we are entering a bull market, at least like a, you know, multi month bull market, then there's no rush to, like, pump it, like, in a fomo into things. Now, chances are next month there are going to be different narratives that we can hop onto. Like I mentioned, I feel like my brain is still in 2022 mode. I think a lot of people are, and obviously, the people that had the most gain is just going max long, and I feel like I need to trigger the 2021 side of my brain again. I don't know where it's gone.
00:12:08.998 - 00:12:34.560, Speaker A: I feel like it's left me sometime in September last year. You know, like, the bull. The bull mode brain is like, you know it's gone, right? It's like, you know, it's. I pooped it out or something, but, you know, I need to find that thing. But in no rush is what I tell myself. And let's. Let's talk about, like, why these narratives work so well.
00:12:34.560 - 00:13:13.696, Speaker A: And, you know, we'll talk about the reflexivity of these defi narratives. And reflexivity is a theory coined by George Soros, where, you know, and this is like a pretty self explanatory chart where if price goes up, then the perception around whatever project or coin goes up. And if the perception of the coin looks better, then the fundamentals just marginally get better. And if the fundamentals right, if people think the fundamentals are better, then the price goes up and people buy, and you kind of create this reflexive loop. And in a bear market, this works to the downside, where one price goes down, yield goes down, because most yield in crypto is paid in, you know, crypto tokens. And when the yields go down, money leaves. Therefore, lowering tbl, then the fundamentals look worse.
00:13:13.696 - 00:13:33.720, Speaker A: So people sell, and when people sell, price goes down. And then it kind of creates this reflexive loop. And at the bottom, the sentiment is defi is dead yield. Farming is dead. Fundamentals are so bad. Lol. And I do admit, like, I think most, like most forms of farming is, you know, like behind us, right? As in it's not going to recover.
00:13:33.720 - 00:14:19.296, Speaker A: I think 2023 and beyond, I think different types of farming models has to be built that are more sustainable. And because people know how to play the game, right? Like, chances are, like, if some random ohm fork launches on, like some l one, you know, it's not going to work because everyone knows how the game is played. And obviously on the converse bull market, reflexivity is what we're experiencing now, where price goes up, then the yields go up, yields go up, token looks attractive, then people buy. Tvl goes up. Because, you know, TbL is calculated by crypto token prices, right? And then people buy, the fundamentals look better, perception looks better, and, you know, you kind of create this reflexive loop and, you know, people say, full auto yield, bye bye, bye. Like, what about you? Like, you know, come on, bros, I'm paying. I'm getting paid 1% in this token that goes up 10% every single day.
00:14:19.296 - 00:15:09.854, Speaker A: And I'm like, oh, my God, like, what am I doing? Right? And that's kind of like the photo that the crypto markets built. I think, you know, the most value add I think I can give you is just be aware of this. So, you know, just be aware that at the bottom, these things look really, really bad. But you should also be forward looking and look to the other side and say that, okay, like, when the markets do recover, like, what kind of token models are sustainable? Like, can this type of product, can this type of yield product work? And, you know, once one starts going up, then, you know, you get to reap the benefits. But also, on the other hand, if prices for, like, random tokens are, like, pumping, like five x, but that token model or the yield model is not sustainable, then sure, it looks great now because it's very inflationary. The token price is very high. But once, like, five people start selling, right, five big holders start to sell, then price goes down 30%.
00:15:09.854 - 00:15:33.702, Speaker A: And then, you know, you have to question the fundamentals of these tokens. So just be aware of these things, the reflexivity in crypto. And this is why price can go down a lot lower than you can expect, and price can go a lot higher than you can expect. And I'm certainly, you know, and we're definitely experiencing that right now. So let's talk about some of the narratives. And I'll get started on LSD because I've covered this before and I think I have some. Yeah.
00:15:33.702 - 00:16:13.472, Speaker A: So I think three weeks ago I mentioned this topic. I think over half the move in Lido ETH and Q one has already played out. So I think there's still upside in things like Lido, but I'm not sure if I can justify buying Lido at the time of recording because there's too much fast money in this. And when I say too much fast money, I just mean that there's a bunch of people that bought Lido in January thinking that they can sell sometime in March and just get a quick two x. Obviously, I don't really know the distribution of the holder base. Of course, the majority of the coins are in the hands of VC's and whatnot, but I don't really know what the VC's are planning to do. So there's no point for me trying to cash these things.
00:16:13.472 - 00:16:42.578, Speaker A: But one of the things I was looking at actually, let's actually pull this up because this chart looks a lot different now. And now this is like one of. Basically for Lido, I was kind of tracking this, right, for Lido eight. And this is, like, one of the reasons I was a little bit more skeptical where Lido tends or this is Lido eth chart, right. So the price of Lido divided by the price of e. So Lido tends to go up a lot. It tends to have these quick pumps, and then it kind of gets distributed or, you know, a very slow distribution.
00:16:42.578 - 00:17:09.520, Speaker A: So quick pump, slow distribution, quick pump. And maybe we're going to see some slow distribution. But obviously, you know, Lido ETh is up 15% today. So, you know, this chart definitely looks incorrect. And, you know, I really do have to reevaluate my entire views on the markets because, yeah, I mean, you know, light o eth. I mean, it's not putting in higher highs in the. In the USD pair, but, I mean, you know, if there's anything that can break this pattern, it's gonna be, you know, the Shanghai withdrawals coming in March.
00:17:09.520 - 00:17:50.388, Speaker A: My view has been that, you know, if I'm gonna bind to a LSD narrative, I'd rather do, like, just by FXS, because if Lido goes up, then FXS will also go up, which is kind of what we're happening here. And FXS was, like, up 21% yesterday. Obviously, it's underperforming today, so. And the reason for that is, you know, if everyone is, like, too focused on or too all in on the LSD narrative and it dies. I mean, of course fxs would die, but at least for FXS, you know, you kind of have this supply, you know, supply going up. And, you know, FXS is also, like a bit on defi infrastructure, in my opinion. So, you know, it's not purely in LSD narrative.
00:17:50.388 - 00:18:10.208, Speaker A: You also get to invest in, like, you know, like, I guess, like the frac stable coin fraxeling and whatnot. They're doing other things such as, you know, trying to replace wheat. Right. Creating a wheat r replacement. And how frac seed works is as more and more frac seed enter circulation that isn't staked. Right. To earn the value reward, it increases the yield for the staked track seed.
00:18:10.208 - 00:18:31.016, Speaker A: And it kind of creates this flywheel. And, you know, if you want to talk about reflexivity, right, of crypto narratives, you know, FXS is definitely, like, you know, one of it, right. But, you know, it's. This probably might break. Oh, yeah. I'll talk about this later. But, you know, definitely a very interesting chart for Lido.
00:18:31.016 - 00:18:45.390, Speaker A: Eat. Where is it? I. Right here. Yeah. So, you know, can this be broken? Probably. But for me, I don't want to buy Lido. I mean, it's already, like a top 30 coin, so I'm not really sure how much upside is left.
00:18:45.390 - 00:18:57.902, Speaker A: Maybe like a two x. But even then, right. I feel like I'd rather buy it into fxs. But, you know, I'm biased and I own fxs. I don't own lido. So obviously, you know, take it with a grain of salt. So let's talk about other stuff, like GNS.
00:18:57.902 - 00:19:08.110, Speaker A: So gnsitive. Very impressive. I think it's like $8 today. Yeah. Which is really, really insane. I mean, I covered this first in September. It was like under $2.
00:19:08.110 - 00:19:27.452, Speaker A: And, I mean, I bought this at like 175. Then I sold it at like 350 ish. Like, I got, like, a two x, and then I was like, okay, cool, like, I'm gonna, like, buy more GMX, right. It's like, GMX is, like, higher quality. I still think GMX is higher quality, but you can't really, like, fade the data as I wait for this chart to look. Okay, there you go. Right.
00:19:27.452 - 00:20:00.486, Speaker A: I mean, like, this is very, very impressive. And, I mean, in hindsight, it's very obvious. Currently, they have, like, this $100,000 trading competition on arbitrum, which is boosting the volume, you know, the daily trade volume doing well. Daily traders looking pretty good. And yeah, this is like the most bullish thing. So Arbitrum dropped basically like the end of December and it's already doing like, you know, 69% of the volume relative to Polygon. So I mean, Arbitrum definitely feels like the hub of Defi and, you know, it's definitely doing well.
00:20:00.486 - 00:20:18.972, Speaker A: And while we're on similar notes, we'll also talk about GMX. So GMx has had some fud, I guess. I mean, I'm not really sure what the FuD is. Let's actually refresh, refresh this. So GMX fees has been kind of going down. But I'll give you my reason on why. I think that's not that big of a problem.
00:20:18.972 - 00:21:09.742, Speaker A: And one of the fud around GLP and GMX is around Andrew King. So Andrew King is like some dude on Twitter. He has a fund, he has this personal public address, and he's like gigalong the majors and he's up like many millions, right? So basically he's up like that much on Avalanche and then on Arbitrum, he's up. I think he's up like $12 million total, actually, probably more like 15 million or whatever it is, right? Basically he's up a lot. And obviously the value is going to come out of Gopdhouse and that's going to be a point for the bears, I guess, in terms of, ooh, GLP gets wrecked in a bull market. But yeah, I think ultimately everyone knows that GLP is going to underperform in a raging bull market because it's like 50% stable coins and retail tends to skew along. So if prices are going up, then GOP gets wrecked.
00:21:09.742 - 00:21:53.504, Speaker A: But I think the most important data to look at is the green line. So this is GOP supply. And as long as the current GOP holders aren't leaving despite traders winning money and actually more people are buying into GOP, you know, the so called debt spiral isn't really going to happen. And as you can see, like the majority of the traders since basically the middle of January has been very, very long, as indicated by Mister Andrew King. One thing that people aren't looking at when this is like the bull case that I think can propel GMX to like, you know, let's say a billion dollar market, captain, is how the fees are distributed. So if you don't know, 70% of the fees go to GOP and 30% of fees go to GMX. And GMX only realizes those fees when traders close their position.
00:21:53.504 - 00:22:08.572, Speaker A: So Andrew King has had this position open for I don't even know how long. I mean, there's a lot of history here because, you know, he was, like, short in December, and then at some point he, like, flipped a gig along. Right. So good for him. Yeah, he was. I mean, it doesn't matter, actually. Let's find this out.
00:22:08.572 - 00:22:33.708, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think he got liquidated and then he just, like, turned Max long. So, you know, so basically, since January 9, I think so going back to here. So all these fees have been accumulating since January 9, basically. So basically a month. And once he closes his position, I mean, we don't know when he's going to close. I mean, I know him, and he's like, you know, super bullish. Right? He's like, beyond bullish.
00:22:33.708 - 00:22:51.366, Speaker A: He's like mega Bowl. I mean, obviously he's like, you're long, right? So I have no. You want to close it. But basically on his east loan, on arbitrary, he's paid $2 million in fees and a million. Right. So that's 3 million fees on arbitrum side. So when he closes his position, that's going to go to GLP and GMX.
00:22:51.366 - 00:23:06.666, Speaker A: And on arbitrum. Sorry, avalanche. Half a mil, like 1.3 million, let's say. So Andrew King alone has $4.3 million in fees. So if he just closes all his position, let's say, in a few weeks or maybe in like a month or so.
00:23:06.666 - 00:23:26.948, Speaker A: Right. Like, whenever it is, there's a chance that GMX might hit, like, more fees than Ethereum. Obviously. It kind of depends how it gets there and, you know, whether or not he does it all at once. But I think if it happens, it's going to obviously be like the highest fee day for GMX. The GMX APR is probably going to be like 50%, even though it's only going to be live, like, weekend. I.
00:23:26.948 - 00:24:03.050, Speaker A: And I think that can actually propel the reflexes narrative to, you know, ultimately get GMX to, you know, the nine figure market cap mark. Because if you think about it, if GMX can two x in a bear market in the 2022 bear market, then why can't it do better in a raging bull market? Or even if it's not like a raging bull market, right. Like, as long as we don't see a repeat of 2022, I'm sure GMX can at least to a two x this year. I mean, you know, I think it's almost up two x already. But, you know, it's definitely something interesting to watch. So cool. I think that's all I wanted to cover.
00:24:03.050 - 00:24:33.146, Speaker A: There's also, like, artem coins popping off, but I'm not sure. I just want to talk about Kanto first because I really cant believe it. Obviously, I hold zero exposure. I am on the sidelines, but I will talk positively on this token. So, you know, don't worry. I covered this back in November 17, and I mentioned that Kanto is this EVM chain on cosmos. You know, they're probably gonna get more traction than evmos.
00:24:33.146 - 00:25:27.770, Speaker A: They're the antithesis of apdos. 90% of the supply is going to the community and all the applications are free public infrastructure, as in they don't take in fees and they have this thing called contract secured revenue where I think 20 or 30% or, you know, somewhere along those lines, 20 or 30% of those fees go to the devs. So the devs are incentivized to create good applications, but that don't take in fees. So, you know, a better user experience for people, which I think is interesting. I mean, phantom in near also does this, but I think the bull case for Kanto was building this really strong community around it at the time. I said $63 million market for this might seem a little excessive, and the bull case is for a loyal community to form towards a shared vision. It's a shared vision, obviously, in hindsight, like, you know, $63 million was very cheap, but, you know, the bold case was for a strong community to form and the strong communities for me.
00:25:27.770 - 00:26:01.684, Speaker A: So I definitely have to change my tune and be more optimistic on Kanto. I mean, which I'm definitely am, even though I hold zero. I like the ethos and, you know, things like this has been tried before, but I think, you know, the. The one thing Kanto has going for it is like the super strong community, the bootstrap community. I think the benefit of Kanto is that really no one, no one really knows how to value this thing. And if there are no valuation models for particular tokens, then anyone can just justify any price. If someone just says Kanto should be 1% the market cap of Ethereum, then that should be like, you know, a $2 billion kanto.
00:26:01.684 - 00:26:23.266, Speaker A: You know, like a market Kanto. And then, you know, you can, like, justify whatever price. Like, I think one of the bull cases of Kanto is, I know no one knows how to value Kanto. Right? It's like, I canto value Kanto. So that's, like, ultimately going to be like a natural bull case. And the price looks like this, like, you know, phenomenal. Like what are you, like what is this, like the reverse McDonald's like the Kim Kardashian double bottom.
00:26:23.266 - 00:26:44.794, Speaker A: Like whatever it is, it's very, very bullish. And I am on the sidelines watching in awe, feeling like I'm underperforming everyone. Unfortunate. And can network fees going up and up. There are, you know, new applications launching almost every single day. Bridging is up and up. Of course this is cumulative volume so it doesn't take into account people bridging out.
00:26:44.794 - 00:27:11.240, Speaker A: But chances are if people are bridging into the ecosystem, what are they buying? The application tokens on Kanto make no money. So chances are no one's gonna buy that. So if people are bridging they're gonna buy Kanto and or Kanto nfts. And Kanto nfts have been doing really, really well. And you know, hopefully it can be beginning of an NFT bull market. And also if you go to the alto market, I think the website is alto build. They have this elevator music and it's really nice.
00:27:11.240 - 00:27:37.580, Speaker A: I think every single application should have their own elevator music. I think it really adds class a. I feel like the canto boom market was catalyzed by this variant post. So they're like a VC. They raised almost half a billion dollars. I actually really respect variant. I think variant in paradigm are like the two VC's I really respect because they actually try to provide value for the project.
00:27:37.580 - 00:28:36.948, Speaker A: Maybe I'm biased, but you know, I really like the variant people and they really, they basically compared Kanto or like buying Kanto similar to like buying buying land in California in the 19 hundreds and this meme has really perforated all over the ecosystem and people are saying hey, like welcome to Canto Fornia, welcome to Web, let's go west. And you know it's, it's, you know it's, it's definitely crazy because you go back to Detroit, January 19 was like this, this candle and as soon as they posted this article, right, it's like up only right? Up only to the right. And the liquidity profile, 34 million very liquid. So it's not like it's some random altcoin with zero liquidity pumping because insiders are pumping or whatever. I mean I don't really know if, I mean I doubt insiders pumping this but you know, basically it's a very liquid token and it's going up. So I mean, you know, a lot of people can benefit from this, right? Very cool stuff. And, you know, like, why can't variant pump my bags, right? Because my bags are not pumping.
00:28:36.948 - 00:29:21.216, Speaker A: Or I mean, some of them are pumping, but not as much. And it makes me sad maybe, right? Maybe, you know, all the variant people are like, you know, bull posting sudo now, and I'm like, okay, like, maybe they can expand to pseudo fornia, but, you know, time will tell. This is just like my copium. This is like my version of coping with holding a bunch of xmon. So let's talk about, you know, blur and the sudo bull case. I kind of talked about this in the previous video, but I think as we approach the February 14 timeline, it becomes more apparent. And this is like my bet on sudo, right? Once NFTs pick up, I think NFT marketplace tokens will do really well because we just talked about how reflexive narratives are in defi.
00:29:21.216 - 00:30:04.366, Speaker A: But I think NFTs are way more reflexive than defi, right? Because price goes up for a particular project and then perception of that project looks better, right? It's like, oh, like x $1,000 for, you know, like for this, right? It's like, I think I spent like $7,000 on this penguin. Can I justify that? Probably not. Am I happy with it? Kind of. And yeah, like, I have no idea how to justify this, right. But when price goes up for nfTs, like, the fundamentals look a lot better and it really creates this reflexive loop. And that's, you know, I think NFTs are gonna have, like, crazy boom in bust cycles for like the next five years, to be honest. Even ten years, to be honest.
00:30:04.366 - 00:30:43.088, Speaker A: And, you know, it's, I think anyone that masters nfts in the next couple of years probably gonna make it out pretty fine in crypto. Probably. There's been this myth. I mean, I guess it's not really a myth, but this assumption that nfts cannot pump in a bull market or like when ETH is pumping, because if ETH is pumping, then people want to sell their nfts back in the ether, you know, to play the USD appreciation and whatnot. And if you look at the data, this is from crypto, Kalio's Twitter channel. So a tip of the hat to him. But I mean, this is comparing, I guess, like the market structure to the summer of 2021.
00:30:43.088 - 00:31:01.744, Speaker A: So following the July bottom. So the market bottomed in the latter half of July and is literally up only, right? Look at this. Up only. Look at this price to be from like 1600 to like three point. I mean, like two x in straight line basically. And how nfts performed is in the month of July. You can see that the volume for nfts were very low.
00:31:01.744 - 00:31:45.266, Speaker A: So, but if you compare to August, it was very, very high. So I think for nfts, I think prices for crypto assets in general has to go up enough. And then the general market has to feel like the general market has to have like a better appetite for risk because nfts are furthest out in the risk curve. So, like, if people think that crypto is bottoming, like, people don't bid nfts first, right? They bid bitcoin and ether and then they buy altcoins and then they might buy nfts. And we're kind of seeing this where bitcoin put in bitcoin and ether put in some God candles, then lido and fxs put in God candles. Now Kantos putting in gone candles. And I feel like at some point thats going to trickle down into nfts and then at that point, NFT marketplace tokens will do well.
00:31:45.266 - 00:32:41.410, Speaker A: But this is like my opium, right? We have these narratives around, like, we have two companies entering crypto, you know, Amazon doing nfts in April. Like, who knows? Is Amazon dropping nfts for like prime subscribers? Like, are they gonna buy pudgy penguins? I mean, definitely not, but it could be a strong narrative. That's one even bitcoin, right? The bitcoin nfts are starting to pop off. You know, people view bitcoin as a pet rock. You know, it's literally a rock. But, you know, if you think about the bare case of BTC, it's like, you know, at some point, the miner issuance isn't gonna subsidize, you know, you know, you know, the miners might leave, right, if the issuance just keeps going down and no one uses bitcoin and the transaction fees don't compensate for it. But if bitcoin NFTs can actually start to have value and people speculate on it, maybe there's gonna be like more demand to, you know, buy BTC or the narrative for BTC, you know, definitely improves.
00:32:41.410 - 00:33:11.780, Speaker A: I'm not like an expert as in, like, how does, like, how do they do this? They're called ordinals. People view them as nfts. But I think it. It's like done differently, I think, you know, I mean, I'm not gonna talk about this because I have no idea. Like, I'm not an expert on this topic, but, you know, bitcoin nfts kind of a thing. There's also this trend towards open edition nfts, and open editions are basically these. They're usually an uncapped supply, low cost mint, where they're all fungible, so everyone's buying, like, the same image.
00:33:11.780 - 00:33:50.410, Speaker A: But, you know, it gives, like, a lower cost of entry. And because, you know, creator royalties tend to be, you know, going towards zero over time. Creators have to pivot by maybe, you know, instead of, like, doing freeman's and, like, trying to charge royalties, maybe it's better to, you know, give access to nfts to a bunch of people for, like, let's say, $10. And maybe some people pay royalties. And, you know, if the NFT appreciates, then, you know, it's all gravy because they collect royalties, and they also collect a bunch of money upfront to support creators and whatnot. So this is manifold XYZ, not the MEV manifold, but the NFT manifold. There's like, two same projects with the same name.
00:33:50.410 - 00:34:18.800, Speaker A: I mean, crypto projects should definitely, like, you know, try not to have the same name as, like, other projects, but you can kind of see the total claims over time going up. And because manifold nfts. Sorry, open edition nfts are all fungible, I think they can be traded really well on particular. Sorry. On the. On NFT mems, which is pseudo, and the biggest one is called checks, I think I. Yeah, so this was an eight dollar mint, and.
00:34:18.800 - 00:34:34.198, Speaker A: Oh, okay. It's 2.28 floor, which is really, really insane. So it's like this. Let's kind of look at this. So it's like this eight by ten grid of, like, check marks. And they're playing.
00:34:34.198 - 00:34:48.338, Speaker A: They're kind of, like, joking at, like, the Twitter. Eight dollar Twitter blue thing. Right. That Elon provided. And the beauty of this is, I think. I think the Jeff butcher. I think that's his name.
00:34:48.338 - 00:35:09.696, Speaker A: He can change the metadata on, like, the color of these trucks. So I feel like every other day, the images of these trucks are, like, changing. I think yesterday it was something else. I don't even know what it was, but now it looks like some alien punk thing. Um, and, I mean, this was literally an $8 mint. And I don't think there was a caps cap supply in terms of. Or, you know, there's like, a max mint amount.
00:35:09.696 - 00:35:37.256, Speaker A: Maybe the max mint amount was, like, ten, but you can do it on, like, multiple wallets. Right. So there's definitely, like, some crazy fraud happening here. And, like, you know, I mean, I get it, right? It's like, maybe the Twitter eight dollar thing is a significant moment in our timeline. Uh, so these check marks mean something to our lives and people are going to spend $4,000 on these. I mean, obviously, like, after price goes up, it just looks a lot better. It's like, oh, my God, like Jeff.
00:35:37.256 - 00:36:24.710, Speaker A: Jack Butcher Jeff or Jack Butcher, like, whatever, right? Mister Butcher, he's like, he is the next Vitalik. He's the Vitalik of NFTs. He is the modern day Picasso, right? And then the price goes up, perception goes up, and the metals look better. And, you know, like, you see stuff like this going up, so I don't know what's going on. And let's talk about like, the blur in Sudoku bullcase, which I have been incorrect on, but my bull case is like, this is essentially set up for like the latter half of Q one, which we're entering. So I think, you know, whether or not I'm right or wrong will depend on where we are at, let's say, the end of March. But basically, my bull case isn't really about or, you know, it kind of a different take on like the bull cases for certain tokens and why people buy.
00:36:24.710 - 00:37:16.670, Speaker A: And from what I've observed, and, you know, I can empathize this, empathize with this because I was definitely in this camp, like, you know, 202-021-2022 where I'm bullish, the NFC sector, but I don't really know what to buy. Of course, I bought my penguin. I have like two penguins and I own a bunch of low, low pudgies and whatnot. But, you know, I think a lot of crypto people, defi people, like bitcoin people, ether people, they don't really want to try to pick an NFT. They prefer to buy like a liquid ERC 20 version of a token that they can use as a proxy to bet on the growth of the entire NFT sector. So if you think about capital flows and how people are going to be allocated to crypto over the next twelve months, I feel like people are generally under allocated to nfts given, I think, where they're going. And I think more money has to flow into the space.
00:37:16.670 - 00:37:57.440, Speaker A: Of course, maybe the majority of that flow goes into individual nfts. That's totally fine. That's very, very healthy. And, you know, but let's say, you know, 75% of the money, new money goes into nfts to speculate and try things out. But I think there's going to be some percentage, like, let's say 25% of new flows that are going to flow into NFT marketplace tokens because people would rather buy fungible tokens than non fungible tokens because of increased or there's like better liquidity conditions. So I think there's a case to be made for being bullish. A quality NFT marketplace token that has sustainable models that can actually make money, that has a reasonable chance to compete with Opensea.
00:37:57.440 - 00:38:25.374, Speaker A: And for me, my bet is going to be on blur and sudo. Obviously I own a bunch of sudo. I do not own blur because I don't do seed investments and the token is not live. But I might buy a blur if it comes out, depending on the valuation. I don't know what the tokenomics are, so it's hard for me to be bullish. But you know, I think the user experience, the UI is pretty, pretty good. And I think what could really propel nfts is if blur does liquidity mining after launch.
00:38:25.374 - 00:39:53.736, Speaker A: This is not confirmed because they don't really tell us anything, but they're going to drop a token on the 14th and I would assume that they're going to do some form of liquidity mining after. If they don't, then just ignore this part. But if they do, focus on this part, okay, just focus on this part because I think it can actually create like crazy reflexivity in NFT land in the latter half of Q one. So I talked about this in my last month's video, but from what I've observed, after we enter like a protraction or like a contraction phase where price of crypto goes down and sentiment is very, very bad, something has to happen on chain for people to be incentivized to use a chain and you know, sure, like on chain activity right now is doing pretty well, but what needs to happen for eth gas to be consistently at, let's say over 80, you know, because we still haven't really seen that yet. And the liquidity mining bubbles thesis, it's similar to the humble farmer thesis that I coined sometime Q two of 2021 where, you know, liquidity mining incentives, like if tokens are being emitted for a token that has some valuation model, that is hard. Sorry, sorry, let me, let me rephrase that. If there are liquidity mining incentives for a particular token and there are no valuation models for the tokenization, then similar to like the candle thesis, the sky is limit, people can justify any valuation.
00:39:53.736 - 00:40:44.458, Speaker A: And you know, if token is going up and people are being paid to buy and sell nfts or like do whatever things on chain, then things can get crazy. And we talked about the reflexivity of the nfts. We can really see something like this happen where, you know, eth goes up a lot and then at some point risk enters back into the markets creating some, like some crazy NFT mania, which kind of, you know, goes into this reflexive flywheel effect. So that's kind of what I'm hoping for. And my version of allocating to nfts is Exmon and sudo because it's more liquid than nfts. I mean, I own pudgy penguins, but they're so liquid, right? I mean, like, what the hell is this thing? We saw this in 2020 Defi summer. Of course, we now know compound to be a good governance token for this lending protocol, you know, and, you know, no one gets excited about it.
00:40:44.458 - 00:41:39.162, Speaker A: But at the time, like, people viewed compound as the future of finance and, you know it's gonna flip. I don't know, like JPMorgan, like, whatever, right? Everyone was like super hyped about this and compound was doing liquidity mining and everyone aped in similarly with Matic and Avalanche, right? I was covering this back then in 2021, but no one really knew how to value l one tokens. I think people have a better idea now given like the supply dynamics and the prominence of Ethel two s and whatnot. But basically people were just saying, hey Solana should be 10% the market cap of Ethereum and people are just buying a hand over fist. And if you cant owe value Kanto, then chances are more money might trickle into it. But you should also be aware that if Kanto price goes down 30%, the fundamentals are going to look a lot worse. But, you know, it's reflexive and if you can play it, then you should play it.
00:41:39.162 - 00:42:32.562, Speaker A: And I think what I've been looking forward to for like over a month now is the blur launch. It's gonna be on Valentine's Day. I'm not really sure how they're gonna do it. I don't know what the token effects are, but I think Blur should be in the low nine figure marking up. I think it should be above the valuation of looks and I think both Sudo and Blur should be above the valuation of Looksrarez. I know Luxray has a bunch of seed influencers, seed investors and influencers, but I don't think a viable competitor to OpenSea is going to be, you know, just like, you know, x two x two Luxray, where you basically like just fork OpenSea and then introduce a token I don't really think that's going to be a model that works. I think the chances are the NFT Amen model or, you know, the Blur, like a completely different design that's probably going to eat into open season market share than something that's already played out.
00:42:32.562 - 00:43:25.550, Speaker A: I think one counterargument around this liquidity mining bubbles thesis is, you know, luxury did liquidity mining somewhere sometime last year, and the market cap hit like a billion before just being down only. So maybe, you know, it already played out. But I think blur in CeDaw is more exciting because it's something that we really haven't seen before and because sentiment is starting to, you know, pick up, right. People are starting to have more appetite for risk. I think, you know, a lot of money can flow into this segment because I think generally people are under allocated to NFTs or like, that sector and, you know, Opensea, right, to protect their market share and their 2.5% marketplace fees, they started block listing marketplaces that didn't enforce royalties for all collections. And, you know, I think at some point blur was doing more volume than Opensea because blur, you know, has zero marketplace fees.
00:43:25.550 - 00:44:15.990, Speaker A: And I think right now they charge 0.5% royalties, you know, for most collections. But Opensea said, hey, like, you know, we don't like you like block, but the workaround around this is, you know, Blur just created a new system building on top of Seaport, right, which is some, you know, Marketplace API created by OpenSea. And, you know, Openc is built on seaport, so, you know, and it's, like free, right, to use. So if blur builds on top of seaport, then there's no way for Opensea to block them, right? So I believe royalties are still enforced for things like server pass. But from my understanding, I don't think Blur has to charge royalties for these collections if they didn't want to, right. If they just wanted to compete based on fees, they can just drop it to, like, zero, and then they would basically capture all the volume.
00:44:15.990 - 00:44:51.934, Speaker A: Because would you rather, you know, pay zero fees to buy a sewer pass or would you rather, you know, pay 5%, you know, 2.5% through Yuga Labs and then 2.5% to Opensea? You know, I think most people, right, even if they, you know, support royalties, they care more about saving 5% on every purchase than, you know, just paying a bunch of fees and saying, hey, I care about creators. I'm not anti royalties. I just think that the current royalties are just way too high and natural forces, market forces are going to converge. Fees to zero. So, you know, like marketplaces have to adjust for that.
00:44:51.934 - 00:45:27.544, Speaker A: And also creators, so that's how they do it. There's also like magically, which is another NFT aggregator, previously called Alpha sharks doing liquidity mining. I mean the token isn't live yet, right? But they're saying, hey, like use our platform and we'll give you tokens for pseudoswap. Obviously they're the NFT Amen model. And there's also a workaround around like the open city block list, for example, mister bursting bagel, by the way. He is like, I think he's like a 19 or 20, right? And this guy is like throwing around 100 EtH and like short pass. Like what the hell is this guy? Right? I'll link his thread in the description below if you're interested.
00:45:27.544 - 00:46:04.106, Speaker A: I'm not going to talk about it, but basically he's, he like put 100 e, like made at least a two x, made like 18,000 apR. So, you know, the important thing for me is, yeah, Sudo is underperforming and maybe I'm incorrect or I'm like misallocated. But the important thing to me is that Sudo is like a model that works. It just needs like more attention and education and incentivization, which I'm working on. And I think it's inevitable that suave takes more market share. It just takes time. And obviously, like when everything else is going up, telling myself to be patient doesn't feel great.
00:46:04.106 - 00:46:36.590, Speaker A: But I guess it's like what I tell myself, like I said, stockholm syndrome. Yeah. And I guess, like the way to go around royalties, right, is like, you know, royalties are not enforceable on chain. And you know, Sudo swap is the only on chain entity marketplace because, you know, blur and, you know, looks rarely and stuff, they store data off chain. So I guess the only workaround around Opensea's block list is to build on top of C port, which I guess makes sense. But you know, for Sudo, right, it doesn't build on top of C port. It's like built on its own thing.
00:46:36.590 - 00:47:17.018, Speaker A: So how you go around royalties is you can create a pool for an NFT, you know, just like create a wallet contract address, right, but with zero nfts. Because if you try to make a pool with an NFT, Opensea will block it. But if you make an empty pool, then OpenSea cannot block it. And then after you create a pool, you can send nfts into that pool, right? So it's like similar to creating some, I don't know, like ERC 20, like ETh USDC pool with zero, like $0. And then, you know, after you create it, like sending some meat into there, like what's open city going to do? Right. Like prevent you from sending an NFT from one wallet to another. Right? Like that doesn't even make any sense.
00:47:17.018 - 00:47:31.914, Speaker A: So I don't know. I think, you know, fees are going to converge to zero, which I think is going to be beneficial for everyone, for all traders and collectors. I don't know why it's not loading. Okay, so I guess that's like the end of the video. I don't know how long. Okay. It's like 40.
00:47:31.914 - 00:48:38.452, Speaker A: Okay. It's pretty short actually, given it's a tacky video. So I guess one thing, one final thing I'll add is, you know, I think post FTX, I basically made a pledge that, hey, you know, I feel like it's easy to, you know, make videos and criticize teams, you know, because they're not doing what I want them to do and whatever. But, you know, I feel like it's, it's kind of hypocritical, right, to be in crypto to buy tokens and just being great at the team for like not letting your token, like making your token pump or whatever. Right? Like, you know, I feel like we should all try to like help teams succeed and whatnot. So I mentioned right last time that, you know, post FTX, I want to help teams really get there, you know, like help them grow, help them expand and help with governance because I feel like, you know, I have many thoughts about certain things, but I don't really participate in governance. So, you know, I think in December I wrote like a proposal thing on GMX on the forums and I got pushed back for that, but it was fine.
00:48:38.452 - 00:49:00.972, Speaker A: Right. I just liked it for the experience. And, you know, in January I've been pushing, or I guess in the month of February I guess I've been pushing for pseudoswap governance. So I guess I have like the most amount of voting power because people are delegating to me. But in the name of, for the sake of decentralization, please. I mean, what, like why are you delegating to me? Right. Like just delegate to someone else or delegate to yourself.
00:49:00.972 - 00:49:18.586, Speaker A: Right. Like you don't have to delegate to me. You can like vote yourself. But basically I did this proposal to make pseudo transferable which did not pass, which I think is fine. I think it's reasonable because for this proposal to pass, it had to hit 2.4 million votes, I think it says. Yeah, so the quorum was 2.4
00:49:18.586 - 00:49:50.332, Speaker A: million and at the time there were only 3.2 million votes that were delegated because I don't think that many people know how to do on chain governance even myself. Right. I forgot to delegate for some of my tokens. So, you know, I guess this was like a way for me to get a gauge on, I guess, like the community. How do you think about it? And right now, so like a week ago I think there was like, yeah, 3.2 million tokens worth of gain that now it's 4 million.
00:49:50.332 - 00:50:10.838, Speaker A: Of course. Right. I mean, this should get like a lot, a lot higher because right now let's, let's check roughly. Okay. Okay. Let's say a thousand xmon has entered or 1000 xmon has been locked. Therefore 10 million sudo should be on the other side on top of like airdrop tokens.
00:50:10.838 - 00:50:36.400, Speaker A: So technically there should be, or if everyone chooses to delegate, there should be like 11 million delegated tokens. So hopefully, you know, I'll do like a follow proposal, tell me this week. And then hopefully that votes, that vote passes. But no, you have to wait and see. Definitely learned a lot with governance. One thing about governance is it's impossible to make everyone happy. I'm in.
00:50:36.400 - 00:51:25.176, Speaker A: Basically if you buy a zero x ones NFT, you get to join this chat full of sudo whales and whatnot. And everyone has different incentives. Some people don't even own sudo and they own a bunch of other tokens and they want, you know, to pump their bags so they're like, you know, against like whatever, like what some people are saying and then other people, I mean, everyone has different incentives and it's impossible for everyone to agree. And this is like why Dow Dow proposals that take so long, like for it to happen. Right. But, you know, I understand Sudo is trying to actually be a dao. And maybe, you know, even though it's slow right now, maybe, you know, like a year from now it's gonna have a lot or I, twelve months from now it's gonna have more value because of how decentralized it is and how it can be listed on more exchanges and whatnot.
00:51:25.176 - 00:51:54.370, Speaker A: But, you know, this is like just my coping mechanism because my bags are underperforming. But basically. Right, actually, let's go back on this. So, yeah, so helping with GMX, helping with pseudo, and I'm also helping fracs with a, their own NFT project. So that's gonna be pretty cool. I don't know when it's gonna drop, but, you know, I'm helping with that. So, you know, I think everyone should try to participate in governance to some extent.
00:51:54.370 - 00:52:40.842, Speaker A: Even if, like, you know, you don't have that many votes, I still think it's worth trying to just experience it yourself. It's similar to, you know, like what I mentioned in 2021. Hey, like, just bridge to random l one, right. And just like, try it out, right? Chances are you're gonna be early. And, you know, I think I learned a lot from that. And similarly, I think I'm going to learn a lot from participating in governance, connecting with a bunch of people. You know, people say, like, you know, your net worth is your network, which is kind of cringe, but I think, you know, it's the only way to really connect with other people is to, you know, put your neck out on the line, open yourself up to criticism, just try to push for certain things to go, and if it doesn't pass, then, like, whatever, right, you iterate, you push again.
00:52:40.842 - 00:53:31.450, Speaker A: If it passes, then great, right? I'm gonna be a part of history, I guess so that's about it. I feel like this is gonna break. So congrats to the LDO holders. I just hold fxs and I'm just happy camper. Yeah, I guess I'll lastly talk about bitcoin dominance because I usually try to get to, like an hour for these videos, so I have, like, some time. So let's just talk about this because why not? So there's been a lot of arguments around bitcoin dominance and how it has to go up because, like, whatever, right? Like, bitcoin dominance went up in 2019, so it has to happen in 2023. And I understand that argument, you know, because crypto is so cyclical, maybe it makes sense to, you know, look into the past to infer what's going to happen to the future.
00:53:31.450 - 00:54:27.196, Speaker A: But I don't think you can actually compare bitcoin dominance, basically the market structure four years ago to where it is now. Because back then ETH was like this two digit shitcoin where, you know, a bunch of teams raised ETH for icos, and then when the price of ether started going down, they were forced to sell. And 99% of these teams didn't really strip anything, so. But, like, now if you go to ultrasound money, right, I mean, there's actually, like, natural demand to use a chain, right, for defi, for nfts. And, you know, obviously you have the supply crunch and whatnot, but if you look at the 30 day time frame, like, look at this, right? Like, it's money is not even flowing back. If you go back to, right, like, under these conditions, we see this. Like, I'm not really sure how I can, like, not be bullish, eat, right, the e to BTC ratio.
00:54:27.196 - 00:55:07.770, Speaker A: And if you go to, like, the burn aspect, let's say in the past 30 days, right, we have opensea, right, like, doing a bunch of volume. We have manifold, right, which is like the open edition thing I talked about, and then uniswap a bunch. But basically, right, in the past 30 days, people have been using uniswap and buying nfts. And I think that's, like, a pretty good trend that people should watch. And, I mean, look at this, right? This is very, very positive. And obviously, I hold things like tricypto as a hedge against bitcoin dominance, even though I'm, like, way more bullish. EBTC at 0.071.
00:55:07.770 - 00:55:41.290, Speaker A: And I think, for me, I think the highest bitcoin dominance can get is, like, let's say, like, the 55% to 50% range. I'm not saying it's not gonna happen, but I think it could happen. But I don't think it can get anywhere above this unless, like, some, like, some, like, I don't know, like, a bunch of countries by BTC. And, you know, maybe that can be, like, its own narrative on its own. But, you know, if bitcoin audience goes something like this, then I'm gonna convert all my truck crypto into ether. That's generally my views. And people have been looking at the 0.05
00:55:41.290 - 00:56:08.520, Speaker A: ish range for EBTC. And if we go somewhere here, I would also convert all my truck crypto into ether. I just hold bitcoin as a hedge against bitcoin dominance, right. Because I really don't want to be the type of person that is, like, full time crypto. And, you know, bitcoin dominance is going to 50%, and I hold zero bitcoin. That would be like Max pain, I guess. There's another form of Max Payne which I've been experiencing, which is this, where my biggest bag isn't really moving.
00:56:08.520 - 00:56:38.776, Speaker A: I mean, it's moving, but it's just, like, not moving as much, which is very frustrating. But those are generally my thoughts on ET, BTC, bitcoin dominance. I get a bunch of questions on that. So I wanted to address it and arguments for a bottom or not for a bottom. Obviously, everyone has their own views, but if you kind of zoom out. Right. You know, whenever the weekly RSI for bitcoin hits 30 and then crosses the 50 threshold, probably a good time to buy bitcoin.
00:56:38.776 - 00:57:14.186, Speaker A: Right? Same can be set for here. Right? 30 crosses 50. Maybe this is a false signal initially, but, you know, basically if you bought back then, right, you were happy, and we just crossed the 50 threshold. I guess if you kind of zoom in, right. You know, following the surge off the bottom in 2019, we kind of consolidated in the 55 to 60 ish range for the RSI, which is where we are now. So maybe, you know, we can kind of pause here before, you know, going higher and, you know, really, you know, scaring the bears. But, you know, like I said, right now I'm in this let everything ride mode.
00:57:14.186 - 00:57:40.496, Speaker A: I'm not really thinking about taking profits. If I get burned, I get burned. But I didn't really buy all my coins the past seven months to sell now because I just, I'm, like, scared about the downside. In fact, I think bears should be scared about the upside, to be honest. But, you know, I naturally lean more bullish and more optimistic than the average person from my, from my experience. So, you know, just take everything I say with a grain of salt. Like I mentioned, none of this financial advice.
00:57:40.496 - 00:58:11.178, Speaker A: My biggest bag is Exmon, and it's not doing anything. So obviously, I have no idea. Like, I don't have, like, you know, a strong pulse into the markets, and I have to reconsider my positioning and think about how I should be allocating moving forward. But like I mentioned, for sudo and blur, I guess we'll see what happens in the coming weeks. We have the Super bowl ad for digidai gaku coming on the 12th. Maybe that can bring more attention. If crypto prices are going up, then the blur drop happens in the 14th.
00:58:11.178 - 00:58:39.890, Speaker A: That can incentivize activity. And then once sudo drops, we can do some liquidity mining for nfts. I feel like there's a bunch of strong catalysts for nfts that are kind of staggered that can help, you know, elevate the NFT volume. And, you know, if something like this does not happen, then I would be wrong, right? Something like this does not happen. I would be wrong. But nfts are such a small market cap that, you know, it's not gonna take that much volume to move the markets. It's just needs people.
00:58:39.890 - 00:59:05.608, Speaker A: The NFT market just needs people to just go further out in the risk spectrum, which might be a big ask. Right. But I think it's going to happen at some point, and I'm just waiting for it to happen while I underperform everyone else. So thank you guys for watching. Let me know if you have any questions in the description below. And like I mentioned earlier, link to the premium discord is in the description below. I make daily updates, three videos a week.
00:59:05.608 - 00:59:20.012, Speaker A: And you also get access to, you know, a community of like, over 500 people. Right. I think it's pretty cool. But, you know, don't copy trade me because I. Obviously I'm underperforming. But, you know, maybe you can learn a lot more from the people in there. So that's about it.
00:59:20.012 - 00:59:51.162, Speaker A: We'll see how bitcoin does. We'll see how eth does. It's. I think it's promising that the LSD narrative is continuing to go upwards. I think, you know if Lido eth can break this, right? Yeah. If lightoweight can break this, I think that's gonna mean good things for other narratives. Because if the narrative that kickstarted the bull market continues to be strong, it's gonna give more confidence for other narratives to piggyback off of light o strength.
00:59:51.162 - 01:00:01.898, Speaker A: And that's what I'm looking for. Thank you guys watching. See you guys. Maybe next month or in a couple weeks. There's actually a lot of stuff happening now, so maybe I have enough content to talk about. Bye.
