00:00:02.400 - 00:00:32.530, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. And what an eventful Monday it has been. So instead of farms of the week, I think I'll do ecosystems of the week because I think it's more relevant given all the news that's dropped. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. So the general overview of the video is now let's go over Phantom cello and I guess like what's happening with avalanche? Like why everything is red, right? So let's, before I get into that, like, let me just take a step back, right. Because I know some people might be hurt from the avalanche dump.
00:00:32.530 - 00:00:58.290, Speaker A: Some people might feel this fomo, right. It's really easy to panic, sell and fomo by the pump whenever these things happen, right. Because I mean, yeah, it just feels bad to be down when other tokens are up, right? But let's take a step back, right. Because we know what's about to happen, right. We know that I'll be incurred. We'll launch in the next couple of weeks, right, on avalanche. Unfortunately, I heard it's been delayed a little bit, which, which kind of sucks.
00:00:58.290 - 00:01:32.820, Speaker A: But, you know, we know it's coming and we all know that when it does come, it's going to bring billions of liquidity into the avalanche ecosystem, right? That's going to happen. We also know that Celo, I guess like a phone based application is going to have $100 million in DeFi incentive programs, right? So I mean, I hope this also came from left field. Like I didn't even know. Like they were that ready, right? They were that ahead. And it's not going to be that big because it's 100 million in educational incentives, grant incentives. So no, this is coming. And obviously Phantom foundation launching one of the largest DeFi liquidity mining programs of all time.
00:01:32.820 - 00:02:17.152, Speaker A: It's not really a liquid mining program, it's like an incentive program. But if you take a step back, like what's happening here, right. Eva Labs is going to be giving away a bunch of tokens to you, right, to us to use their ecosystem. Phantom is giving away a bunch of their tokens to developers to build on their ecosystem, right? And the devs can do whatever they want with the f team tokens, right? I'm sure some will do liquidity money incentives with those phantom tokens. And Celo is also giving away a bunch of money for defi incentive programs, right? So if you take a step back like these, these, these ecosystems will be giving you money to use them. Right? So let's, let's not take on that much risk, right? Let's, let's take a step back. Let's not really fomo PI for FOMo pump a FOMO buy to pump on everything.
00:02:17.152 - 00:02:42.376, Speaker A: Because if you take a, let's say even like a one to two month time horizon view on the markets, we know that avalanche is going to be big. We know that Phantom is going to be big. So let's not get rugged. Let's, you know, be conservative. Let's, you know, let's actually build a plan for a portfolio. Because if you're panic selling the dump and Fomo buying the pump, then that's just the person that has no plan, right? And it's always good to have a plan. So let's go over what my plan is.
00:02:42.376 - 00:03:06.466, Speaker A: Right, given, given that entire rant. So essentially my plan right now is right now I'm focused on Avalanche because yes, the Phantom token is up. I don't even know almost 50% and everything in their ecosystem is pumping. Look at this. If you go to Coingecko and look at phantom ecosystem coins, everything is up. Spirits scream tarot. It's up four x today.
00:03:06.466 - 00:03:42.080, Speaker A: Spooky's up double. What the hell? I think this is signs of the market being more efficient. Because if you look back in April when I first started covering the Polygon ecosystem, the market didn't really price the $100 million incentive program that Polygon put in place because on April 14, I think the price of Matic was roughly thirty cents. And then obviously it peaked at almost $3 in middle of May. And I think the market learned from that. And then when Avalanche instant launched their Avalanche rush program, everyone was like, okay, like, we all know what's going to happen. Let's just buy everything on avalanche and try to make money.
00:03:42.080 - 00:04:25.492, Speaker A: And I think people that missed out on Polygon, people that missed out on avalanche are like, okay, we saw this. We saw the headline, let's buy everything up. Let's just gobble everything up. And to me personally, I don't feel right like buying these things after it's forexed in 24 hours, especially as soon as I woke up. Because I mean, we all know what's gonna happen, right? I mean, sure, like maybe you can argue that these are undervalued, but I mean, I personally just don't wanna be buying people's forex is like in the same day because maybe this is the market being inefficient in some way, but the phantom into the program it's not going to be launched immediately. In fact, it's going to take a couple of months for this to play out. So let's actually read into the, in the fine print, right.
00:04:25.492 - 00:04:53.108, Speaker A: Because I'm sure a bunch of people just like bought a bunch of coins just because they saw the timeline, which, I mean, which honestly is not a bad strategy. Right. I mean, this is obviously bullish for the phantom ecosystem, but let's actually look into the fine print. And I guess the one thing I will say is that, you know, this is super, super bullish, medium to long term, for the phantom ecosystem. Short term, I'm not sure. Right. Obviously everything has gone up, but in terms of like ecosystem growth, this is super bullish for the medium to long term.
00:04:53.108 - 00:05:26.330, Speaker A: Right. So let's go over why I think that is. So I guess with this incentive program, they're not going to be giving a, giving money away to users like you and I that like avalanche Rush is doing. They'll be giving money or giving Ftm tokens to the developers, right. And the Phantom foundation says, you know, like, instead of us giving money to the users, let's let the developers choose what to do with the FTM token. Because some developers might want to create on app, I'm sorry, create on Phantom, hire more developers with the FTM tokens, right. That's what they want, what they might want to do.
00:05:26.330 - 00:06:22.534, Speaker A: But some developers, they might just want to, you know, use the FTM tokens as liquidity mining incentives to, I guess, win liquidity over from other protocols. So how does essentially happens is that if you create on phantom and your protocol can stay above a time weighted average of five to $100 million of TVL for an extended period of time, you can apply for this grant, right. You essentially have to prove that you're not a scammer, right? Essentially. And once the, once the foundation has approved the application, a two month long cliff commences, after which rewards will start to vest on a monthly basis. So I'm assuming what's gonna end up happening is let's say in September a bunch of teams are gonna apply for grants and let's say in November they're gonna get approved. And then starting November, their rewards will start to vest on a monthly basis. So I don't really see like a huge rush into Phantom in terms of like 510 billion dollars of TVL until like November.
00:06:22.534 - 00:06:48.372, Speaker A: Obviously, if AavE launches like in October, that's going to change. But assuming, assuming that, like, nothing else changes outside of this, like this pure liquidity mining program. Sorry, incentive program. I don't really see this being a huge deal in the short term. Right. Obviously, everything has gone up because people are speculating and they want to buy low, sell high. But, you know, as more of like a farmer, as a person that's going to be using these protocols.
00:06:48.372 - 00:07:18.246, Speaker A: Me personally, I'm still not that interested in bridging funds over because I think in the short term, avalanche still has, I guess, the short term gains, right. The short term liquidity shock. Because let's say this thing blows up in November. Maybe the price of phantom is already high by then, but there's not much you can do right now other than play around in the existing farms in this ecosystem. I'll go over them later. Actually, let's go over them now. I'll just go over three forms that I think are good.
00:07:18.246 - 00:08:00.128, Speaker A: So obviously, spooky and spirit swap, they're the two main dexes. They're competing with one another, which I think is good, right. You always want two decentralized exchanges so they can keep competing, keep innovating, etcetera. If you think about the game theory behind spirit and spooky is that let's be real, they're going to be approved for this grant and they're definitely giving away, at least in my opinion, phantom to its users. Because let's say you're spooky swap, right? And spirit swap starts doing liquidity mining programs. If you're spooky, are you really going to let them do that and not do anything? Right. Because if that happens, spirit is going to take away all the liquidity because that's where the incentives are.
00:08:00.128 - 00:08:34.990, Speaker A: So I think game theory wise, they both have to do liquidity money incentives with FTM tokens, right? Like, let's say in November. So I think this will be a really good farm for people to participate in. Another one that I want to go over is Taro. This is like leveraged liquidity leverage LP positions, always your own research. I haven't done that much due diligence on this, but I hear that this is really, really good. Essentially, you can use your LP position as collateral, borrow more against it, and then use that to LP, etcetera. And the cool thing is that you can actually just supply liquidity.
00:08:34.990 - 00:08:54.402, Speaker A: I don't think I'm connected. Actually. I am. You can actually deposit. Sorry. You can lend USDC here, right, and earn 105% in USDC, paid some in USDC, paid some in taro, which I think is obviously, which is pretty good, right? So there is risk. Right.
00:08:54.402 - 00:09:06.746, Speaker A: This is. I don't. I don't even know if this is audited. So. Always doing research. I'm not a huge expert when it comes to Phantom. In fact, I think the one expert that you all should follow is this channel called FTm alerts.
00:09:06.746 - 00:09:25.522, Speaker A: I actually had a conversation with him, like, two weeks ago when I was, like, doing my due diligence. And as you can see with, like, this red bars. Like, I've been watching a bunch of his videos. I think they're good. I guess this is proof that I actually do research. But I think he is one of, like, the FTM mega bowls that you should follow. He covers a bunch of.
00:09:25.522 - 00:09:42.834, Speaker A: I mean, he made a video today about, like, spooky swap. Right? So I'm gonna have him on the channel next week, probably to discuss what's hot on Phantom. Why is he so bullish? I guess give his bullish cases and, like, how. How he built his conviction. So look out for that video. I think it'd be a good one. I'll provide a link to this in the description below.
00:09:42.834 - 00:10:09.660, Speaker A: So make sure to subscribe to his videos. Okay. So where was I? Yeah, so phantom markets, pricing things in. Obviously, this is really, really bullish, but in the short term, I don't really see, like, something crazy happening on Phantom. Right. Maybe I'm wrong, right? Like, I've been wrong before, but that's what I see. So I think in the short term, I think me personally, I'll just be staying on avalanche just waiting for these incentives to come.
00:10:09.660 - 00:10:27.410, Speaker A: Because when they come, they're going to be really, really good. Right. So my. I guess, like, my timeline, which can always change, is September, October. Maybe focus on avalanche. Maybe bridge some months to Solana if I, you know, if some bullish catalysts go there. And then in November, I'll reevaluate things.
00:10:27.410 - 00:10:52.790, Speaker A: Obviously, I'm making this video on August 30, and I'm sure my plans will change in, like, a couple of weeks. But that's just how I'm thinking about it right now. There's a lot of, I guess, hype around phantom Celo. And, you know, the question is, like, is avalanche dead? I don't think avalanche is dead. We all know what's gonna happen. Like, what do you think is gonna happen when Albion curve launches? Right. So much money will flow into the ecosystem, I guess, in terms of, like, let me just refresh this page.
00:10:52.790 - 00:11:31.426, Speaker A: So I'll also provide a link to this in the description below. But you can actually track, like, how much money is entering and leaving the avalanche ecosystem, as you can see, the green bar is like how much is coming in and the red is how much it's coming out. Yesterday we saw like the first red day in history, right? And today seems red as well. So maybe in the short term there's like a lull in the markets and all of the minesher goes to Phantom, right, because that's where everyone's looking at. But I don't think this changes anything. I still think avalanche is still going to have a bunch of liquidity come over once all the incurable launches. Hopefully it comes soon because, yeah, obviously the market looks red.
00:11:31.426 - 00:12:14.980, Speaker A: But I guess like two people that are kind of scared, like they don't have a plan, they want to know, like, what the hell should I do? The one data point that I always turn into is, I guess, like, the thesis is that there's always a flight to safety when it comes to these ecosystems. Because, you know, I kind of compare. The reason I was so bullish on avalanche a couple of weeks ago was because, you know, I was on polygon, right? And liquidity mining incentives are really, really bullish for ecosystems. And we saw this when like Aave on Polygon was announced April 14 when the price of quick swap was $150. And then two weeks later it peaked at like almost $1500. Right? This is ten x'ed. And the date for the quickswap peak was April 30.
00:12:14.980 - 00:13:00.578, Speaker A: So let's hypothetically, where do you think Matic? When did the price of Matic peak? And actually the price of matic was actually like $0.80 on April 30 and it peaked on May 18, right? So essentially my thesis is that, sure, like these altcoins might enter a huge bubble. Like, everyone's into them. There's always going to be a flight to safety, right? And the safety is always going to be the native token, right? Avax. And you know, maybe, maybe we're going to see that playing out. Obviously, like Avalanche will underperform like all these tokens to the upside, but it'll also outperform everything to the downside, right, because it's the higher market cap coin and there's like naturally more demand for Avax tokens. So that's why, like, Avax has always been my largest holding.
00:13:00.578 - 00:13:43.840, Speaker A: And, you know, if you're more risk, if you're like a risk averse player, I think if you're bullish on Avalanche, you just buy Avax, deposit it on Benki or Neil. And I guess, like, more reasons to show that, like, we are still really early into the avalanche ecosystem is by looking at the liquidity profile for avalanche. Because if you go to Pingalin and you, let's, let's say you want to swap $100,000 of USDC to tethere, you're going to incur 23% slippage, right. This means that there's no liquidity for USDC right now. And I mean, sure, I mean, you can interpret this to be bearish, but I interpret this to be. We are early. We are early.
00:13:43.840 - 00:14:22.480, Speaker A: Benke announced today that their liquidity mining initiative for USDC is live today. So if you deposit USDC on Benki, you'll be earning AVax in key rewards. So hopefully this incentivizes more people to bridge USDC over from Ethereum or polygon to Avax. And obviously when a curve launches this de pegging aspect, I mean, it's not really just depend, it's just like no liquidity that'll be fixed. Right. Because the reason curve is so important is because curve is the reason why stable coins are pegged to each other everywhere. Because that's what curve does.
00:14:22.480 - 00:14:36.734, Speaker A: Right. And that's why curve is so important. So yeah, hopefully benq comes. So let me just touch on. So speaking of avalanche defi, I did a live stream with crypto Messiah and Noah sag yesterday. It's a two hour video. It's a long one.
00:14:36.734 - 00:14:53.368, Speaker A: I know people don't want to watch two hour video. So I added timestamps if people want to like skip through everything and go over, I guess, topics that you're interested in. So check out that video below. Let me refresh this. I think it's almost like 8000 views or whatever. It was a good one. It was a good one.
00:14:53.368 - 00:15:13.720, Speaker A: Yeah. Dozen views. So good video. Check it out if you want to learn more about how, I guess crypto ogs are thinking about the avalanche ecosystem. So just quick updates on the terra ecosystem, right? Because I mean, I didn't forget about you guys. I'm still super bullish, Terra. But you know, I sold all my mirror tokens just because, I mean, I love mirror.
00:15:13.720 - 00:15:28.216, Speaker A: I think it's great for him. But I'm just going to use mirror as a revenue source. Right. It's just a way for me to, I guess make more dollars. And let's look over here. So this is my setup this morning, right? When I haven't done anything, right. My setup is still pretty nice.
00:15:28.216 - 00:15:45.570, Speaker A: I had $475 with the mirror. My luna is up a lot. But today I took some profits. I sold my. This is like profit taking. Essentially I just took dollar 475 mirror and sold it for USD and I deposited it into a anchor. Right.
00:15:45.570 - 00:15:58.826, Speaker A: So it used to be seventeen k and now it's 17.45k. Right. So now I sold my mirror, I farmed it for free, essentially. And now I'm earning 19.5% on anchor. Cool. But what am I doing with anchor? The token.
00:15:58.826 - 00:16:26.424, Speaker A: Right. So one thing that you should note is that there's gonna be an airdrop for anchor stakers, governance stakers for this protocol called Nexus Protocol. I don't really know how much they're gonna be airdropping, right. So I have no idea. But because, you know, they're going to be taking a snapshot of all the addresses that's been staking their anchor. Now I'm just going to stake my anchor and hopefully this is a big airdrop, right? Yeah. So that's what I've been doing.
00:16:26.424 - 00:16:57.286, Speaker A: And if you look at this tab, yeah, I put on my anchor here earning 7%. So I can expect $322. Obviously, I'm still farming anchor, but now I'm just staking it and not selling it because of the airdrop. And in terms of bullish catalysts, I feel like every single week the TVL on Anchor is going up. And, you know, if you looked at my Columbus five video with that, I did with Joseph and Danku. UST is the most important asset in the terra ecosystem because as there is more demand for UST, Luna has to be burnt. Right.
00:16:57.286 - 00:17:37.746, Speaker A: It's like, I like to call this like Ponzi nomics, but like, not actually a Ponzi just because, I mean, we can actually track the demand for USC. And as long as that's going up, we can expect the price of Luna to appreciate as well. So I think I covered a bunch of things that I wanted to cover. Hopefully this hasn't been too long a video all at timestamps. But I guess what I'll be doing is that I'm not going to be deploying assets on Phantom, partly because of the reasons I mentioned, but also because I'm going on vacation from September 1 to September 5. This is going to be with my college and high school buddies that I haven't seen in a while. And for those that don't know, I played poker professionally.
00:17:37.746 - 00:18:18.234, Speaker A: And, you know, when I first went to Vegas, I lost five k for the World Series of poker. So this is gonna be my redemption. Right? Like, I'm so much more studied. Like, I mean, I was, like, I locked myself in a room last year to study poker, essentially to be a pro. But, you know, I'll be in Vegas from September 1 to September 5. I'll still post videos that I'll be pre recording, but, you know, this is essentially like my last trip with the boys, I guess, before I really put my head down into crypto and, I guess, other life pursuits, because September 7, tentatively, I'll be launching my patreon. I'll provide more details later.
00:18:18.234 - 00:18:49.960, Speaker A: But, you know, I'm gonna go in really, really hard. It's gonna be like a project that I'll be putting a lot of my time into. So look out for that. So, you know, I guess, you know, this is the lesson of, like, form based around, like, what your life situation is, right. Because if you're going to go on vacation, you can't be degenerative. So I'll mostly be exposed to Avax. That's been my play for a while now, but I'm still going to do that, and I'll still hold some other ecosystem plays, but in terms of sizing, it's nothing compared to eVax.
00:18:49.960 - 00:19:09.370, Speaker A: And I haven't really done any other changes to my portfolio. I'm still in this comfy scenario where my Luna price or I guess, yeah, I'm still holding all my Luna. I'm still borrowing against it. Right. These aprs have gone down significantly. But, you know, I mean, you're still being paid 10% to borrow. Right.
00:19:09.370 - 00:19:42.178, Speaker A: And it's actually not 10%. Right, because it's 10% plus. Well, assuming what you want to do with your USD, you can be paid 10% to borrow, but you can deposit the USD back into here and during 19.5%. Right. So, Luna, amazing yield on yield on yield. I feel like with avalanche and with Luna, I feel like once you bridge funds over, it's kind of difficult to bridge funds back to Ethereum just because Ethereum is so expensive. So hopefully this is a good video, long one, but if you like the content, please like and subscribe.
00:19:42.178 - 00:19:58.160, Speaker A: Yeah. So much things happening. You really gotta be on top of your toes because things can change in a dime, right? I mean, who really saw this coming? I didn't. I actually did the research. But anyways, thanks for watching, have a good one and have fun farming out there.
