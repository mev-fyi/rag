00:00:00.200 - 00:00:09.130, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Taki here. Welcome to episode 20 of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I have here with me Andy, or more commonly known as yield farming, on twitter. How are you doing today?
00:00:09.750 - 00:00:13.010, Speaker B: I'm doing pretty good. Nice to talk to you, Taki. Haven't talked to you in a while.
00:00:13.630 - 00:00:32.540, Speaker A: Yeah, so, you know, we've hung out a few times in real life, but, you know, I think you're kind of this prolific tweeter just tweeting your mind out on defi farming, the points meta and everything. So I think a lot of people would want to hear your story. So let's talk about that. So how did you get into crypto, and what do you do now?
00:00:33.440 - 00:01:14.144, Speaker B: So I initially got into crypto in 20 end of 2017 when my high school roommate told me to arb the Korea premium. So I did that for a couple of weeks, made a few thousand dollars, quit crypto for good, and thought, I'm never going to do crypto again. Fast forward four years. I came back from the military after went to military in Korea, and he actually happened to go to my college, and he was like, yo, like, what if we bought some NFTs? We're gonna make so much money. So he got me to buy the top of NFT. Summer, I think I bought some collection called Sneaky Vampire Syndicates. It was supposed to be by some bored apes artist.
00:01:14.144 - 00:01:38.970, Speaker B: It went down maybe 100%. I'm not sure. I lost a lot of money in that. So that's kind of how I started crypto. And after I had my NFT arc, what I did was, well, I happened, so I was trying to make my money back. So I was buying a lot of these NFTs, whatever people gave me a white list to. I was like, I can make my money back and bought whatever they gave me.
00:01:38.970 - 00:02:23.592, Speaker B: And one of those things that I bought was a fork of wolf game. Yeah. So I played the NFT Ponzi, but this one had a token attached to it and to kind of control the inflation, they had all these weird Ponzis attached to the token on top of the NFT as well. And there I made some money because I was kind of quick with Ponzis. And they also got me to bridge to this new chain called polygon, where gas is a lot cheaper. So just kind of affordable for me to play crypto. I think after I made, like, my $10,000 out of the three or four k I had left after giving after my NFT arc, I was kind of like, browsing around polygon chain since now gas is only, like, $0.30.
00:02:23.592 - 00:03:03.610, Speaker B: So I said, what can I do on this chain? What are some things to explore in crypto? And then I found Aave, and when I clicked Aave, they were showing me 5% APR for depositing USDC. And that kind of, like, blew my mind at that time, because I was like, wow. Like anywhere else in the world, they'll probably give you, like, 1.5% for USD, for, like, depositing your USD for, like, four or five years. Here, they're giving you 5%, like, right now, no questions asked. Like, this is a feature of finance, right? Like, $8,000 that I had at that time, or whatever I had, which wasn't that much. So the next thing I googled was actually high apy Defi Polygon.
00:03:03.610 - 00:03:13.992, Speaker B: And then I got introduced all the Ponzis. Actually, I think one of the first videos that it came across was one of your videos at that time, the food farms back then. So.
00:03:14.056 - 00:03:14.680, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:14.720 - 00:03:21.140, Speaker B: That's kind of, like when I kind of, like, got into crypto, like, the end of 2021, early, like, very early 2022.
00:03:21.880 - 00:03:34.420, Speaker A: Yeah. This. Do you remember this video? This is my most watched video. It's like a quarter of a million views. And it was just me looping things on Aave with my farmer hat. I'm not sure if you can see it there. And I was just, like, talking about.
00:03:34.420 - 00:03:50.454, Speaker A: Yeah, like, how did he remember Krill? This was such a scam with deposit fees and whatnot, but somehow no one really knew what they were doing, but it just kept going up, and I was like, farming and dumping. Farming and dumping. Yeah. Much simpler times back then. Much simpler times back then.
00:03:50.622 - 00:03:51.086, Speaker B: Life was.
00:03:51.118 - 00:04:00.182, Speaker A: Now everything looks like this, right? It's like this goose finance chart, just down. Only. No, every. Every project looks like this, but, you know, much simpler times.
00:04:00.326 - 00:04:26.908, Speaker B: Yeah. And then I found all these high API defi stuff, and after clicking a couple of things, the first thing I find that is moderately viable is some toon forks, which I think, I don't know, tag if you play with them. But some people listen to this, or people who played in the Ponzi's definitely have so toon fork, too, was a Ponzi made by some anon. But by the time I joined, it was taken over by Harriet the Phantom guy. It had. And Phantom was very hot. This was.
00:04:26.908 - 00:05:01.816, Speaker B: This thing had, like, a $300 million liquidity pool, which was supported by, like, 20% of Phantom's market cap at that time. Like, making. Pulling this entire policy together while it was inflating at, like, four or 5% supply a day. So it makes no sense, but it worked at that time. And so I'm seeing this, and I'm seeing. And then at that time, like, I didn't really understand the Ponzi aspect of it, but I understood the Genesis pool thing, which is like, deposit your dollars, get back, like, two to 3% returns in three days. That's like a 300% apr.
00:05:01.816 - 00:05:22.368, Speaker B: So I was like, wow, like, if you compound this, I'll be a millionaire in, like, three weeks. This is crazy. So I play these, of course. Of course. This is my first time interacting with anything Defi. So I think, as most people did in Defi suburb when I wasn't here, they never sell. They actually pair their assets with the Ponzi token and see it go down 95%.
00:05:22.368 - 00:05:44.900, Speaker B: So I also lose, like, half my stack, my first tomb fork that I ever played in. But afterwards, I kind of learned that, oh, like, selling is really good. Like, buying is really bad and selling is really good, which was something I learned very quickly in my time in crypto. So I kind of move around farming and dumping very, very quickly.
00:05:46.250 - 00:05:56.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's what you're known for. I was collecting audience questions, and one of the questions was, can you tell Andy to stop dumping on me? And I was like, he's never gonna stop dumping on you.
00:05:56.082 - 00:05:58.430, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm never gonna stop dumping on people.
00:05:59.890 - 00:06:16.320, Speaker A: But this is like your journey, right? Like, I guess you got wrecked with NFTs, maybe made some money on Wolfgang, discovered tomb forks. And I guess you ran your small stack to almost a million dollars in the first six months. Was this mostly on just phantom chain, like, with Harry Ponzi?
00:06:16.700 - 00:06:39.980, Speaker B: Yeah, tomb forks were actually kind of all around. I think the most prolific ones are definitely actually avax. Avax, Phantom and BSc. So, like, the typical chains. Yeah, I think Phantom was better for people who had money, like, initially. But for me at that time, like, phantom was, one, a little expensive, gas was a little expensive. Two, the yields were a little compressed.
00:06:39.980 - 00:07:14.502, Speaker B: I think people were a lot smarter. I think on Avax, people were willing to be a little bit, a lot more dumb playing around with their money. So I. So I think, like, big thing of how I went from ten k to 750k was actually, like, I found some, like, exotic bugs in these tune forks where devs were literally copy pasting, like, anything they see and running a toon fork is very profitable. And every time they set some parameters, thinking they're going to think they're cute, they're clever, whatever. They always make some mistake. Like they change some parameters, but they don't initiate the time timer.
00:07:14.502 - 00:07:49.926, Speaker B: So they don't know, like this timer actually happened for like three days. And then when they initiated again, the contract actually fetches the time when the contract was deployed like four or five days back and makes four or five days worth of emissions like 1 second. So if you stake your, if you stake your Ponzi inflation tokens, then you're going to get like a 400% return like in 3 hours. And it is like very evident because I was kind of like thinking about this for a long time. But I think people were a lot more excited about the Ponzi aspect. Ponzi aspect of numbers going up. So they didn't think about it that much.
00:07:49.926 - 00:08:44.314, Speaker B: So I was able to stake like $85 worth of governance tokens into a printer that was not like initiated on the front end, initiated for them with the contract call that was public and print like 25k worth of tokens, like out of $80, stuff like that. So I was able to see like outsized gains very quickly the first month when people had no clue what was going on. And that's how I kind of went from 30 20 to maybe like two hundred k the first month of how I was in defi, like well, ponzis. And after that I just like farm dump. I was also a pretty good trader, I think. So there are definitely several names people in the two and four space in you that are kind of like good for farming and dumping. I was one of them, there was a guy called Brando and yeah, good days anyways, like people that were pretty good at farming and dumping.
00:08:44.314 - 00:09:23.620, Speaker B: I was pretty good at day trading these as well. The inflation was based on six hour epochs where the inflation inflated like 4% something crazy. So I would just sleep like 2 hours at a time, like three times a day. So an hour and a half before the epoch I would wake up and start trading an hour and a half after until the hour and a half after epoch. And then I kind of like finish, see how everything unwinds, see how people trade, and then I'm like, okay, so I have like another four and a half hours until next epoch. So I'm like I'm going to sleep 2 hours. So I sleep 2 hours, wake up, do it again, and I kind of did this over and over and over again for maybe two to three months.
00:09:23.620 - 00:09:29.580, Speaker B: And yeah, like I have like 5600k. That's great.
00:09:30.000 - 00:09:51.910, Speaker A: Damn, that's crazy. Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty experienced with tube works, or I guess, tune finance in general, maybe not in a good way. I made this video. This was like, what is this? December at the market top? I had this farmer hat so no one would take me seriously, and then I got rugged. This is, like, my only rug in crypto. When.
00:09:51.910 - 00:09:59.390, Speaker A: When Harry ye partnered with that auto compounder, I forgot what they were called. It was like, the reaper finance or something.
00:10:00.450 - 00:10:01.178, Speaker B: Yes, yes.
00:10:01.234 - 00:10:19.702, Speaker A: Grim finance. And then I woke up and it was all gone. I was actually, like, on, like, a trip with friends, and then, like, my friends are partying, drinking, and then I'm just, like, on my laptop saying, oh, holy shit. I just lost a sizable sum of money. So definitely good memories. Yeah. Like, the pond, like the tomb.
00:10:19.702 - 00:10:33.850, Speaker A: Ponzi was insane back then. It was. I guess you're kind of exploiting it in a different way, and I guess, like, that was your edge. Back then, I was more. So less sophisticated. I was like, just like, you know, yield farming. I was also farming and dumping.
00:10:33.850 - 00:10:53.450, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess, like, one thing you learn as a prolific yield farmer is that selling is good. Right? Like, you know, you get these tokens. They're probably not that worth much. They launch at high valuations. Just dump it, dump it, dump it. So I guess that's kind of how you grew five figures to, I guess, high six figures.
00:10:53.450 - 00:11:08.260, Speaker A: How has your strategy changed since then? I guess you were doing, like, the super dgen stuff when no one really knew what was going on. Now that people kind of know what's happening. Right? People are more sophisticated. How do you try to look for outsized returns on your capital?
00:11:09.800 - 00:11:13.352, Speaker B: Should I fast forward a year and a half to now? Maybe that's a yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:11:13.376 - 00:11:16.500, Speaker A: Let's look at, like, seven figure arc, I suppose.
00:11:17.360 - 00:11:33.104, Speaker B: Yeah. I think even at the end of 2023, there were just outsized returns by farming. There were a lot of things you could do with your money. It was kind of boring, but you could still kind of. No, that's a lie. I think the second half of 2022 was actually really boring. There's nothing good.
00:11:33.104 - 00:11:58.182, Speaker B: We were always like, how do we make any money now? Farming is over. So it is really bad. But I think, yeah, 2024 is great. I think Q one was probably the bull run we're going to look back at in, like, a year or two years and be like, wow. Like, that was our opportunity to change our lives, and we missed it. There was Etherfi, there's Athena. Both of which, if you kind of, like, thought about distribution or thought about what's good.
00:11:58.182 - 00:12:20.108, Speaker B: I think, yeah, I think there were definitely outsized returns you could have locked in your pt for Athena. I sold very early, and that was like 90% APR. So getting 90% apr pretty much like no questions asked in your stable coins, was very easy. I bought some. I bought some. What is it? Ether five. It's.
00:12:20.108 - 00:13:03.966, Speaker B: I think that is a big trade that I kind of, like, made a lot of money on. That is like, yeah, that's where most of my p and l came from this year, which was people were trading the Eigen layer points for $0.15 on wheels market. And I was like, okay, so if you deposit to etherfi, how much you're getting? Like, what's that? Epr? And then I saw that if you just sell the ether, if you buy the ether five it, and sell Eigen layer points on whales market, then you actually make all the money back immediately from selling Eigen layer points. Each of our points are free. So I was like, wow, like, what a free arb? And I put like low six figures into buying. Selling the Eigen layer points on whales market.
00:13:03.966 - 00:13:24.640, Speaker B: And I probably bought like four to 500k worth of ether five. Its. Of course fast forward like four or five months. You get rugged by Wells market on the actual Eigen layer points, and it doesnt work out. But also March 15 ether five TgE's. And the TGE is a $4 for a bill. And I saw like a 3.5
00:13:24.640 - 00:13:29.140, Speaker B: x on my returns. I made seven figures in that trade.
00:13:29.880 - 00:13:48.292, Speaker A: And that's crazy. So, I mean, I know how PT and YT works with Pendle, but for our audience, can you kind of explain why you thought, you know, buying the principal token and the yield token was a good trade? I guess, like specifically for Athena or ether five, whatever, you know, is like easier to explain for you, like, from your perspective.
00:13:48.476 - 00:14:30.724, Speaker B: Yeah, so easy. I think an easier way to kind of talk about Pendle. I think some people who may know better about Pendle than me may be a little angry. But the PT is like the token which you sell your, which you can sell your future rights to yield to and compound in advance. You're basically getting upfront yield, and the YT is where you pay a premium to buy the rights to earn the points, or the yield with the underlying token that you buy into. So if you buy a, say, like USD YT, then you're buying the rights to get all the points, sats. Sats allocated to the amount of yt, USD yt USD's that you buy immediately.
00:14:30.724 - 00:15:00.636, Speaker B: Because you're basically saying that if my and all the yts have like a expiration time, so say the expiration time is like one month, and you buy like a million of it. Then after. For a month, you earn a million dollars worth of points. And then after a month, that's a completely useless. All you got was points. So these trade a pretty low price, of course, because they don't have any underlying capital behind them besides points. But in other words, you can buy a lot with at a low price.
00:15:00.636 - 00:15:05.908, Speaker B: So it's leveraged point sparring, which is what Pendle's known for, right?
00:15:05.964 - 00:15:43.174, Speaker A: And that's what propelled Pendle to crazy valuations. It's one of the few defi tokens that's actually performed. Of course, I'm not part of it. I mid curve the entire thing, as I often do. But I guess these leveraged points forming like buying YT made a lot of sense back then because the points meta was still pretty new, still pretty undiscovered. But what's kind of your take on, I guess, the current points meta? You kind of had this tweet where gains are almost always outsized when it's a black box, since I guess no one really knows about it. So I guess there's more edge to be had.
00:15:43.174 - 00:16:05.574, Speaker A: But once there's any clarity, the cost of capital starts to converge to whatever the market rate is, which you say, like eight to 15%. In other words, if you need a ten x, don't form points happy camper for, quote, unquote, no returns. Can you kind of go over, like, what you mean by this and where you see the yield farming or airdrop farming meta going forward for, let's say, the rest of 2024, it's kind of.
00:16:05.582 - 00:16:40.152, Speaker B: Like winding back to slightly. Before I made this tweet, I think even starting, like, mid April, I was kind of, like, flooding Pendle, and I was saying that, like, yeah, like until. Until Renzo. I think the people who buy white tees will make a little bit of money, but afterwards, people just lose money buying YT's. People will be not that excited buying YT and Pendle anymore, which will make pts, which is like the big capital, the real capital. Who buy, who give TvL to Pendle, not want to come to pendle anymore. The TVL will spiral down and Pendle will go to.
00:16:40.152 - 00:17:21.955, Speaker B: I said zero, but I think something between two to $3, I think now a little less. But was kind of like my Fud. Starting in, like, mid April. And this is kind of, like, extension of that, I think. I think people were kind of, like, so, end of 2023, people were kind of, like, busy buying majors, making kind of, like, actually trading. But now that the market's not good, now they don't see a lot of upside of buying BTC, like, all the majors and also looking horrible. They're kind of, like, looking to, like, squeeze whatever yields you can find in the market, and you look at, like, what could be what's kind of, like, a good yield that you can farm, and then there's not much, especially with size.
00:17:21.955 - 00:18:00.294, Speaker B: For me, even now, like, it's kind of like high seven figures, low eight figures. So there's not a lot to play with. So I can kind of, like, make some outsized gains type of like a. I can find edge. But if you have $50 million, $100 million, the only thing you can do is deposit the blast, deposit to linea, deposit the scroll, deposit to. Okay, name your next five l two that you would think will launch, like, a high valuation. And that's the only thing you can do, because those are the only teens foundation tokens that you can reliably believe that they will launch at a fair valuation.
00:18:00.294 - 00:18:04.010, Speaker B: That one you'll get paid out to. It won't get hacked so easily.
00:18:05.510 - 00:18:05.894, Speaker A: Right?
00:18:05.942 - 00:18:25.398, Speaker B: So. So that means that, like, there's billions of dollars in aggregate across the market competing to squeeze whatever is the best out of these three four options. So if you. If you give, like, a number. No, okay. Okay. So they're all competing to get these yields, but everyone's benchmark for these is not very high.
00:18:25.398 - 00:18:58.100, Speaker B: If you have, like, a billion dollars in the fund or. Or $100 million in the fund, even your benchmark is, like, 15 or 20%. So if you hear any metrics from anybody saying that, hey, I heard they might give, like, 20%, or, hey, I think Linea will give 20%. I think scroll will give 20%. Now everyone's interested. Everyone crowds in, and now the yields can press closer to lower. So, in general, I think the more clarity you give, the more likable it is for capital and the lower the yields are.
00:18:58.100 - 00:19:37.472, Speaker B: Of course, if you're linear, if you're scroll or any of these big l two s that actually benefit from having a high TVL, since it kind of, like, signals that, yes, indeed, we are better than all the other chains. And that's why she launched a higher valuation. It's a win win. But if it's, like, a slightly smaller, slightly smaller l two slightly smaller token, then getting all this TVL will just compress the yields, I think. I wouldn't mind where it was kind of like floating at a couple hundred million TvL and then it kind of skyrocketed to 500 mil and it didn't do much for their valuation. Right. It kind of like didn't do that.
00:19:37.496 - 00:20:11.590, Speaker A: Well, yeah, and even like blast, right? I mean, I thought it would launch, let's say three or 4 billion fTB, but now it's sub 2 billion. And, you know, I don't really see this TVO coming back. Blast is number seven, 1.338. They do have some native builders. They have like fantasy top and I guess some exciting projects. But, you know, I had this example of, you know, now Manta, right, Manta had like almost a billion TVL, I think. And now their TVL is sub 50, which is kind of insane.
00:20:11.590 - 00:20:31.892, Speaker A: And now the token is less a billion, and then mode is also sub 200. So I guess maybe l two tokens are this cycles pool. Two tokens, like Dex tokens, right? Like you just deposit capital, reform it and you just dump it, move on. Is that kind of how. Yeah, yeah. L two s are the new pancake swap. I think that's like a good way to think about it.
00:20:31.892 - 00:20:48.156, Speaker A: And I guess they also found ways for VC's or to convince VC's that, hey, like give us $20 million and we'll build a note too. And I guess, you know, farmers are like, yeah, like, fuck that. Like organize, farm and dump. Do you kind of agree with that assessment? Just, l two tokens are just right.
00:20:48.188 - 00:21:17.336, Speaker B: Now, l two farming campaigns. All the points campaigns are basically pool twos. They are pancakeswap farms. I I think it's very similar pancakeswap also in the sense that if you make a pancake swap, work on, like, tellos, I don't know, like some chain that you've heard of once in your life but you forgot about afterwards. Then of course it's not gonna do well. Of course it's gonna go to zero. But if you make like a good pancake swap, work on, say, arbitrum, like even in 2022 or early 2023, it did pretty well.
00:21:17.336 - 00:21:34.736, Speaker B: Like, it did pretty well for a while. And that's kind of how I look at these l two s. I think a lot of these have merit. I think they, I think they could exist. And of course, I only think one will win in each sector. Say, like ZK, there's like four or five leading ZK chains. I think only one will prevail.
00:21:34.736 - 00:22:20.608, Speaker B: At the end of the day, I think out of like, all the op stacks are a little different because they all function differently. I think the native yield narrative blast kicked it off, but I'm sure other chains will follow, follow through in the future. At least I think they should, because I think it's a good narrative. I think blast is a good chain, and I think only one will prevail at the end of the day. Like, will it be blast? Like, I am led to think so, but maybe better things will exist in the future. And in that sense, I think, like l one s, many will die, but at least I think one in each representing sector will survive and keep a modest valuation where we're probably not making fun of them in three years, or we're too busy making fun of the other 50 l two s that failed to make fun of the one that's less bad.
00:22:20.744 - 00:22:54.492, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess if your view is that, you know, yields are, I guess, converging to, let's say, you know, ten to 20%, because that's what people. That's like everyone's benchmark. Do you think that we're transitioning to a meta where it might be better to farm, quote unquote real yield, whatever, like whatever that means instead of points farming, you even had this tweet where, you know, if you have even like half a million, it's probably an easier life to live. Just farming things that actually pay you, like a real 20% or 25%, 30%. Instead of like trying to, you know, trademark teams. Yeah, try, try to trade.
00:22:54.492 - 00:23:14.960, Speaker A: Because airdrop farming is a form of trading, right? You think that it's worth depositing capital here instead of there. So you take this action. Where do you think farming goes from here? Do you think yields are just going to compress, or do you think that the meta has to shift to something that's more exciting or sustainable?
00:23:22.830 - 00:24:04.210, Speaker B: I think it really depends. Let me give it a thought for a second. I think it goes both ways. It's kind of right now, I think for like Q three and maybe early. Like, I don't, I don't know anything about these projects for the timelines, but I'm assuming Monad will launch, launch sometime in Q four, maybe early next year. And my mentality is actually that we're going to farm these l two s points programs, eigen layer symbiotic for the rest of the year with our ethereum, and then we're going to go at the end of the year to Monad and farm some incentives on Monad or whatever is hot on Monad. It's kind of like my thought of rotation.
00:24:04.210 - 00:24:53.338, Speaker B: I think yields are definitely getting compressed, but I think that happens at every bull market. I do think, or people told me that, like, every day for a while, like, all the food farms or whatever was printing like, 1% a day for such a long time, and then it kind of, like, tapered off, got less and less, and then it became what I saw when I kind of started defi in, like, early 2023. I think it'll be pretty similar. I'm not saying that the bull market will end right now, that it'd be very bad for my ethereum bags, but I do think yields will go down significantly for the rest of the year until there's, like a very. It's like, obviously, but until there's, like, a violent bull market where all the alts go up. Very. Like, all the alts go up and it costs capital to farm, these coins go up, it'll just be bad.
00:24:53.338 - 00:24:55.510, Speaker B: I don't think we'll be making a lot of money farming things.
00:24:56.650 - 00:25:15.672, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess right now you're farming Etherfi, right? Season two. Well, that just ended. But I. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I also have deposited some money into the super symbiotic LRT vault for Etherfi to also farm. Symbiotic.
00:25:15.672 - 00:25:19.832, Speaker A: It's so tiresome. But I guess, like, this is what you're doing now. This is on Twitter where you're like.
00:25:19.856 - 00:25:23.180, Speaker B: Just, oh, yeah, the ave looping for etherfi.
00:25:23.520 - 00:25:34.422, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, why is this a thing? Like, why, like, why are, like, why is Etherfi giving points to people that do this? This doesn't create any economic value. Right. Like, are they just trying to pump TVL and, like, mesh to them?
00:25:34.446 - 00:25:54.598, Speaker B: It pumps TVL. Right. Like, for every dollar that I did this, I actually had to, like, either buy Etherfi eth on the market or I had to stake directly with them to get this. So to them, it is economic value since the. How much delegated, like, the TVL delegated to them did go up for exactly how much I staked.
00:25:54.774 - 00:25:55.086, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:55.118 - 00:26:27.078, Speaker B: Of course, the net exposure is the same, but my net exposure is the same because I'm looping this asset and leveraging this asset at the cost of the idle capital at Aave, not from Etherfi. So I don't think they care too much, and I don't think they're. And right now, they're not paying that much either. In their tokens. Starting season three, since you're seeing 25 million tokens for two, three months, which is now like $60 million for 8 billion TVL. What is that? That's like 3% Apye for three months. So they're not even paying that much in their governance token anymore.
00:26:27.078 - 00:26:47.214, Speaker B: They're getting sponsored by each staking yield. They're getting sponsored by Eigen layer points. They're getting sponsored by Idle Capital on AAve. So they're getting a lot of. They're leveraging a lot of inefficient capital around crypto. They're not actually paying a lot themselves. So I think it's not that bad, actually.
00:26:47.214 - 00:26:51.934, Speaker B: Like, as we're speaking, I was depositing to Aave some ether five eth. Like right now.
00:26:52.022 - 00:26:53.890, Speaker A: That's right now, yeah.
00:26:55.870 - 00:27:11.886, Speaker B: Like 2 hours ago. And there's only like 100 ETH left. So I was like, I do need a deposit. Right? So I was trying to deposit to this for like 30 minutes and Stargate was taking a while, so I was like, okay, I can finally deposit. And I just did. So no more. No more disturbances, okay.
00:27:11.918 - 00:27:12.142, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:12.166 - 00:27:12.358, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:12.374 - 00:27:14.286, Speaker A: Okay. Now you can fully focus on that.
00:27:14.358 - 00:27:15.930, Speaker B: Yeah. You have a full bandwidth.
00:27:17.010 - 00:27:44.856, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, if the past 30 minutes was you on like half your bandwidth, and that was pretty good, you were giving some pretty, pretty good answers. I can't. I can't wait for the next 30 minutes plus. Yeah. And I guess, you know, I also just like wanted to bring out this tweet, you know, I guess like reminiscing on the past. Like, things are definitely better in arbitram defi summer when we were all a part of the wholesome 150 million op forming and dumping kronos exchange together.
00:27:44.856 - 00:27:49.340, Speaker A: And I was kind of curious. Guess how much tvl they have now? Chronos.
00:27:52.520 - 00:27:53.620, Speaker B: 300K.
00:27:54.360 - 00:27:55.380, Speaker A: What the heck?
00:27:56.200 - 00:27:57.344, Speaker B: Oh, genius.
00:27:57.512 - 00:27:59.688, Speaker A: You're genius. What the heck? How did you know?
00:27:59.864 - 00:28:02.976, Speaker B: I didn't look at it. But that was a educated guess.
00:28:03.128 - 00:28:14.830, Speaker A: Educated guess. Interesting. Yeah. I went from like 300 million. I remember like people were buying the Kronos NFTs and like, you know, trying to convince me that it was a good idea. And I guess, you know, this is, this is what happens.
00:28:15.690 - 00:28:52.410, Speaker B: I do think that anybody who shield this token when it is launching, I think of them very negatively or at least hope that they, or try to look for evidences that they kind of like grew beyond that in crypto. Because I feel like there's a very obvious, like. Well, it wasn't very obvious, but in my opinion, it was like a very clear path to zero. So if you're showing it that I feel like, either you were kind of, like, misaligned, or you were kind of like, ill intended, or you were just, like, not very knowledgeable. And, like, both is fine, but the latter is more fine than the former. So that's kind of how I look at it.
00:28:52.950 - 00:29:03.302, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. So I guess right now you're farming etherfi. You're just clicking buttons while we're recording. You're also farming linea and scroll.
00:29:03.486 - 00:29:31.906, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm farming linear and scroll. I think I was ranked. Yeah, yeah, I think I was ranked for linear dashboard on my public wallet when it, like, first launched. I think I'm down to, like, 30 now since I stopped farming my public wallet for a bit. Yeah, on scroll I have a decent amount of marks. All I can say is decent because I actually don't know how many I have since I farmed it on like, six different wallets. If you add it up, I think it's a pretty decent.
00:29:31.906 - 00:29:59.370, Speaker B: It's a sizable sum. I'm hoping that I get paid out pretty well from both of them, but I'm farming both them pretty heavily since I think it's like the last frontier of yield stacking. I think a couple of tweets ago, I was saying, like, the yields are compressing to 10%. The best you can do is to kind of like, compound all of these together. And the way to compound these is to farm Etherfi farm Nile Noori. We love dog. Like, it's a Dex that I farm and dump on.
00:29:59.370 - 00:30:20.270, Speaker B: They're great friends of mine, but I just dumped their governance token. I feel kind of bad. But by doing this, you can stack, like, 10% from ether five plus eigen layer, 15% from farming their stuff, and another like 15% to 20% from what I think is 15% to 20% from farming these l two s. And now you've gone from 10% to, like, 40% to 50%, which is. Sounds a lot better.
00:30:20.430 - 00:30:26.494, Speaker A: Feels a lot. Definitely does. I guess, like, I'm just, like, not bullish. Linia, launching a token because you don't.
00:30:26.502 - 00:30:27.782, Speaker B: Think they'll launch Tokyo.
00:30:27.966 - 00:30:33.210, Speaker A: I mean, they're getting sued by the SEC. Like, do you think they can launch a token right now? I'm not quite sure.
00:30:33.790 - 00:30:55.184, Speaker B: No. When people ask me what they should farm between scroll and linear, I actually, like, would tell them, like, hey, like, it's pretty. In my opinion, it's pretty similar. If I were you, I would actually farm linia first because linear has, like, a very clear roadmap of points decaying over time. I think I actually made a tweet about that as well. Maybe it's, like, right below this, too.
00:30:55.352 - 00:30:56.544, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:30:56.592 - 00:31:23.560, Speaker B: Like, there's like, they had, like, all this multiplier stuff where you were getting, like, less and less every month. So I was like, yeah, like, if you're gonna get 20% less next month compared to now, uniform, linear now you can just scroll later. That's kind of like my mindset. But you also need to count the fact, like, price and the fact that there's maybe, like, a 1015 percent chance now, definitely higher, that lineage just won't have a token. They were just, like, wrong, and they would just not have a token for much longer.
00:31:24.420 - 00:31:44.942, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, because, I mean, consensus. They've been talking about a metamask token since, I mean, forever, and they haven't done that yet. And then now they keep getting sued. Who knows? Like, maybe I'm too bearish on Joseph Lubin and his ability to drop governance rights to all of us. But, yeah, I'm like, just honestly. Yeah. Like, farming is so boring now.
00:31:44.942 - 00:32:23.298, Speaker A: It's like, you buy or stake with an LRT, you bridge to an l two, and then you just wait. Right? Like, that's kind of the extent of what you can do right now. And reasonably, you can expect 20% plus APy or APR, which is pretty good in the grand scheme of things, but it's not really anything that's going to, you know, make people rich. Yeah, it's not good for the vibes. Right. Because, like, every altcoins are dumping, and I don't think the current market gives people the opportunity to run it up. Maybe with memes, but even that part is that sector of the market maybe slowly dying.
00:32:23.298 - 00:32:58.870, Speaker A: And also, the average person is coming at a place of just not having an advantage because you don't have the insider information, the cabal information. I guess my question to you is, obviously you ran up ten k to a sizable amount. For someone that's watching this video now that wants to, I guess, go on a similar path, what kind of advice would you have for them? Let's say five figures to seven figures. How would you approach it if you had to do this all over again?
00:33:00.580 - 00:33:23.068, Speaker B: I would trade meme coins like you trade meme coins. I say almost as if I have a higher. Like, I have moral high grounds because I don't, like, actively trade meme coins. But I think meme coins are definitely better right now. Like, if you do defi. Like, if you do stuff that I farm, all it gives you is, like, at max like a 60% to 70% returns on your capital a year. So if you start with ten k, you're going to make $7,000.
00:33:23.068 - 00:33:54.730, Speaker B: You can't make that your full time job. The only way to run it up is to trade meme coins. I actually believe in this very heavily. If I started crypto again with five k, ten k would exclusively trade meme coins and never go on ethereum. I am very certain about this, and I think that's kind of why the vibes are bad, but kind of to get into this, I think there's definitely levels to the game. We're actually, Taki and I were talking in a discord server yesterday, kind of like me talking about this, where if you are a new entrant to the industry, you're definitely. You're at a massive negative edge.
00:33:54.730 - 00:34:26.834, Speaker B: I think when you were playing, like, Ponzi Defi, Ponzi's like Doom forks, the negative edge was like -20% as in, if you're like, a very blind participant, your return for every dollar you put in the Ponzi is probably $0.80. So you're going to lose money. But there's still a lot of variants. You might lose money, you might make money, you might lose money. I think for meme coins, it's a little worse. It's very skewed towards insiders and there's definitely levels of the game, but there's always ways to also improve. I think if you go into these telegrams, there's a lot of schizophrenic people.
00:34:26.834 - 00:35:04.405, Speaker B: There's also methods into making friends. Actually, I had, like, a one month arc when I was actually very inactive on Twitter. I think, like, end of May and beginning of June, where I, like, made a new account, made a new Solana wallet, made a new telegram account, and, like, try to, like, trade meme points of pumped out fun. And I was like, I can't do this. But I realized there's so many people in these telegram chats very active. There's actually ways to, like, make, I wouldn't say friends. Maybe friends, but initially allies who you're kind of, like, aligned with, then your bags and furthermore allies they kind of, like, work with.
00:35:04.405 - 00:35:40.410, Speaker B: And over time, I think you, I think you level up. I think your negative and edge goes away once you have. Once you're kind of like, talking with people after you've been, I don't know what to call these. Like, actually didn't participate in any of the community takeovers. Like, after you've kind of been like, been a part of these ctos, whatever. You kind of know, you kind of hear things. You know, like, you hear some good news, you, you hear some things, might do well, whatever, and you start to, like, I say, like, perform better, and you're, before what used to be, like, for every dollar that you put in, you might lose like forty cents.
00:35:40.410 - 00:36:20.254, Speaker B: A lot of these meme coins now it's looking like you might actually break even. You might do a little better. And I don't know how to, like, think about this, because as we saw yesterday in the chat, some people look at it as like every, every layer of outperforming. The lowest level. Like, no information on the market is a degree of symmetric information, inside information. But I don't, like, necessarily agree because I feel like if you're just doing things together, like if you have friends or if you are, if you, yeah, I think it's a part of networking and I think there are levels to the game. I guess I shouldn't say that very publicly, but that's kind of how I think about it.
00:36:20.254 - 00:36:57.060, Speaker B: And I think there are still, still a lot of ways for people to kind of improve, meet more people, make more friends, learn more, and all these things make you a better trader, even if it's on pumped up fun. And if I went back, I would do exactly this. And I probably, I'd probably be in like 150 telegram chats, try to dm like ten people at the same time, try to do everything at once until like, I found a way into kind of like being more connected or having a better knowledge in the game. And that's kind of how. Kind of how I operate.
00:36:57.930 - 00:37:47.716, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. It's the crypto markets are so rigged in the favor of insiders. So for an average person to just outperform or just make money, you either have to get lucky or you have to be, you have to make friends, right? And when you say make friends, like, I don't think you mean, like people are like pumping and dumping on each other. I think it's more so the fact that, hey, you know, if you know a bunch of people, then you get more information, and with that information, you have a better idea where to farm next. Where to? Yeah, like, yeah, you can like shrink your decision tree and then make better decisions. Whereas if you know nobody, then your decision tree is infinite, and then you're probably gonna fall into some scam, right? Like that's being shown on TikTok. Yeah, I definitely agree.
00:37:47.716 - 00:37:53.254, Speaker A: You definitely need to network in crypto either. Just start a channel.
00:37:53.342 - 00:37:55.198, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:37:55.374 - 00:38:26.142, Speaker A: No, yeah, I mean, I always tell, like, encourage people to, like, I'm, like, very shy. I'm very introverted. Right. You probably noticed because we hung out a few times, but it's like, I still put myself out there, you know, like, making videos and, like, shit posting on Twitter because, I mean, first of all, I mean, shit posting is kind of fun, but it's like meeting people in New York. Like, in real life, it actually gives me a lot of value because Twitter, very toxic. YouTube very toxic. I meet people in real life, it's like, wow, these people are not toxic.
00:38:26.142 - 00:38:54.904, Speaker A: Right. It's like, really, really wholesome, and it actually helps me become more optimistic. I think it makes me a better person as well. So, like, the real life human connection, I think, is very, very important. Crypto. And also, you know, I guess if you can befriend devs across different ecosystems, then, you know, they can just kind of, like, tell you, oh, like, yeah, like, this ecosystem sucks, right? Just bridge out, please. Or, oh, yeah, like, you know, we might be doing stuff in the next couple weeks, maybe stick around.
00:38:54.904 - 00:38:59.504, Speaker A: I think that's kind of like. Do you kind of agree with that kind of style of networking?
00:38:59.552 - 00:39:32.726, Speaker B: I absolutely agree. I think it's turned out to be very favorable for me. Like, I think I was very lucky that I made a lot of deaf friends in 2023 when there's nothing to do with these, like, big l two s, big caps. I was just farming on arbitrum, like, farming on train, dumping things. And I made a lot of dead friends back then. And then now, like, the time comes for all the l two s, I ended up, like, making friends, like, becoming friends with some people who are going to make some random foundations. I went, well, I went to eat Denver and, like, talk to some random people and ended up making friends with, like, people who work, like, random, like, random chains, random foundations.
00:39:32.726 - 00:40:07.744, Speaker B: And now, like, when people randomly, like, tell me out of the blue, tell me, like, hey, like, I heard someone from this left then now I immediately know, like, I can correct the dots and be like, oh, that means, like, like, why is this l two? Why is this foundation? Whatever. Losing employees. Is this token worth less farming and all? Like, again, it affects my decision tree and it makes me make what I think is more informed choices. Of course, sometimes having these friends can fuck you. I think it definitely happens. Sometimes they tell you some things that aren't that accurate. You.
00:40:07.744 - 00:40:28.080, Speaker B: You buy, well, you shouldn't buy into tokens or sell tokens. Based on what your friends tell you. But when you do, like, maybe you get fucked, maybe you don't. So remember aptos about, like, aptos having like, a OpenAI partnership, Microsoft, all that.
00:40:30.020 - 00:40:33.960, Speaker A: I was not part of that cabal. I'm not really part of any cabals, to be honest.
00:40:34.340 - 00:40:58.280, Speaker B: But it was like the word in the street. And then apples went from like, $12, like 19, $20 went straight to, like, eight and was not great. So, like, sometimes you get fucked, sometimes you don't. So I think every, every choice you make is your own. But hearing, hearing things from other people always helps because at the very least, I'm looking at the markets from someone else's perspective.
00:40:59.020 - 00:41:26.810, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, it's. It's really easy to have bias in crypto, especially, like, you know, bag holder bias. Like, you know, it's like people that's been farming blast, like, now they feel kind of stuck, right? Because now there's, like, vesting. Token keeps going down, but it's like, oh, like, I can't leave now, right? But sometimes maybe it's best to just cut ties. I mean, like, I'm not, like, trying to talk down on blast. I do think it could be a good chain, but I'm just, like, seeing it as, like, one example of.
00:41:26.810 - 00:41:46.410, Speaker A: I guess it's like, it's like once you commit to something, like, you feel like you're stuck. It's like sunk cost fallacy, right? Yeah, there's always that in crypto. And I guess, yeah, it seems like, you know, despite you farming and dumping all the tokens from your dev friends, they still like you, so, you know.
00:41:47.750 - 00:41:51.930, Speaker B: They think of an asshole. But I'm also helpful at times, so it goes both ways.
00:41:52.270 - 00:42:19.864, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I'm curious, like, what, like, what are your life goals? I mean, you know what, like, you know, you kind of talked about this, right? It's like, after three months of, you know, pretending I'm busy, I'm finally gonna do a podcast with him. And I asked you, like, who's, like, who's this profile picture? And it was like, it's like your ex. I never bothered to change it. Like, like, what are you doing, man? You have. You have to change your PFP. Like, you can't dull on the past.
00:42:19.864 - 00:42:20.584, Speaker A: You have to.
00:42:20.632 - 00:42:41.500, Speaker B: It's like a. Well, I use this account very long ago just to, like, put music on my, just as, like, save music on Twitter so I don't lose it. So I didn't really use it very actively. I put the picture by exterior because I'm not sure, actually. I just need to make a Twitter account. And then it didn't have a profile picture. I was like, let's put something on there.
00:42:41.500 - 00:43:06.300, Speaker B: And then again, that's probably a lie. I think something I was thinking back then at the end of 2022, or maybe early 2023, when I was putting this profile picture, was likely that I just felt like it'd be funny if I put in a female girl, like a girl profile picture and then see what people think. I thought it's like a social experiment. And actually, for the first three or four months of me being active on Twitter, people did think I was a girl. So I guess that was my work. Yeah.
00:43:10.400 - 00:43:12.000, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:43:12.120 - 00:43:36.462, Speaker B: I put it as a joke. I never bothered to change it since. Yeah, like, I had nothing to change it to. Like, if I change my profile picture, I want to change it to something that kind of, like, captures, like, what I'm doing in crypto or, like, what I think is, like, me, but there's nothing because yield farming is also a name. It came up, like, out of the blue. I was trying to get a d bank id, and then they were like, you need to put a name. And I was like, what do I name myself? Well, all I do is yield farms.
00:43:36.462 - 00:43:49.688, Speaker B: I can name myself yield farming, and then it turned into this. So I have no idea, like, what my name came from. I have no idea what my Twitter tag came from, and I don't really have an idea what I'm doing with my profile picture. But here we are. They all come to place together.
00:43:49.824 - 00:44:10.020, Speaker A: Now, I kind of want to pivot to audience questions, because I got a bunch, actually. I think a lot of on chain farmers respect what you do. Farming and dumping, looking for Alpha. And I guess one of the questions, I got a few of these. Do you do any work around checking if the contracts are safe before entering a new protocol? If so, to what extent?
00:44:11.770 - 00:44:32.138, Speaker B: Yeah, so this, I definitely did a lot more before, I think, when I was aping into the pancakeswap forks, arbitrum, or any chain, something much more deepen. I checked the code pretty thorough. Well, not thoroughly, because I'm not a good device. Not. Not a dev period. So I kind of put get the code, see what I from. It's kind of obvious from what the code base is.
00:44:32.138 - 00:45:11.264, Speaker B: Put a. Stuff it in the diff checker, and like, great, it's the exact same. And then I'm like, okay, so it's probably not getting exploited now. Like, what? How much perm? Like, what perms does a dev have that could rug me and I checked that and that's about it. In terms of like how I check contracts for, for lending markets. I kind of check the collateral that exists in the lending market, the borrow caps, the oracle that they use and like the contracts behind these or the team, there's usually from lending markets. There could be a lot of way, not a reason for you to want to change Oracle because maybe Oracle and bad maybe like you need fallbacks, whatever.
00:45:11.264 - 00:45:52.960, Speaker B: So you need to have like governance perms, not governance, but like deploy your permissions on the Oracle is deployed. That also means that if they swap out the Oracle to something like not correct. If they swap out the Oracle to say like one BTC is like $2 or a million dollars and borrow out everything and rug you, then you're rugged. So I kind of think about like the reputation of the team as well. Nowadays a lot of these things matter a lot more in 2023. I think in 2024 when we're basically dealing with VC backed chains, VC backed projects, Aave, Etherfi, there's not a lot of worries in what you're actually farming because it's so centralized. You, you know, the exact person who's actually behind these keys.
00:45:52.960 - 00:46:15.700, Speaker B: So it feels a lot better now in 2020. Yeah, 2022. 2023. I probably slept like four or 5 hours a day maximum because I have to wake up in the middle of the night to see like am I exploited? Like is something bad happened? Actually it saved me because I woke up at 04:00 a.m. and that's how I bridged out of Phantom, my multi channel exploited before all the bridge money went out. But I don't do that anymore. I sleep like eight, 9 hours.
00:46:15.700 - 00:46:26.120, Speaker B: I wake up at 09:00 a.m. and I'm like, I can sleep more, sleep three more hours till twelve and I feel great. Like I'm not very worried about my money like nowadays, which is, yeah, big life.
00:46:26.820 - 00:46:51.922, Speaker A: I remember during the 2021, like on chain bull market, I would like refresh VfAT tools. I think that was the website like every single day. And then I would cross reference that with rug doctor to make sure that, okay, like this is not a rug. I'm like, all right, I'm deposited capital. Yeah, yeah, but like now it's like, yeah, like you're farming. Blast, you know, backed by paradigm. Sure, I'll bridge money, dump the token bridge out of either fi.
00:46:51.922 - 00:47:25.220, Speaker A: Yeah, like, you know, I'll bridge, bridge and bridge out. So do you think that these like defined farming is just whale money games. Like, what's the end game here? Right? Like, are we just, like, farming all these centralized coins that will probably just go to zero eventually? Is our job just to farm and dump, get the fuck out? Like, accumulate more eth in USDC? Is that kind of how you view it? Like, where. Like, when do you stop farming? Like, when would you stop? You know, like, there has to be a number and, like, crypto farming?
00:47:25.260 - 00:47:49.422, Speaker B: Yeah, like, so the number goes up. It's good. I do think there's a number where I stop, which I won't disclose, but I would like to have, like, a house in the three or four core cities that I live in. And then a. And then there's money in. Enough money to kind of, like, give. Give my children or child a good life.
00:47:49.422 - 00:48:10.670, Speaker B: I don't even have a girlfriend. I've. I have my ex's profile picture on my profile. One of these days, I'll have a girlfriend. I'll marry, I'll have kids, and, yeah, I like to have enough money to support that child. And that's kind of like the level that I think about as, like, a first level. The second level is much, much deeper, which is, like, I want to have enough money wherever.
00:48:10.670 - 00:48:51.256, Speaker B: Even if the world, like, all the edge cases, all the tail edge cases of, like, doom happens in the world and I still can, like, afford to protect my own life and my family's. For example, like, say, like, there's a zombie accomplice and the world is, like, very clearly over. And even then, like, if you have a lot of gold bars, you can probably hire some people. Like, at least convinced me, like, hey, like, right now the world's, like, fucking over, but maybe in ten years it might be back. And this gold bar, when the world is back, will definitely, like, change your life. That's, like, an argument you can make. Of course, it'll probably cost more than a singular gold bar for them to protect you, but stuff like this can probably, like, help your survival in some.
00:48:51.256 - 00:49:18.272, Speaker B: To some extent. It'll just cost a lot more than it does now. Now, if you have a gold bar, you're buying a car, right? And maybe if that happens with the gold bar, you'll buy, like, two ramen. Like, two ramen noodles. Like, who knows? But, like, the marginal value money will decrease to zero, but it'll still be worth something. And having enough money and being prepared for all those scenarios would be great. Now, that's, like, a completely different territory from my first, my initial retirement number.
00:49:18.272 - 00:49:33.620, Speaker B: That's, like, the second number that I'm thinking about. Like, if I have enough money to like, have a bunker, like, diversify all the AI coins. So I'm like, not AI. Like something AI, or like somehow be AI alliance of an AI takes over the world. Like, they don't kill me. Like all these things. Like, if I can do that, that'd be great.
00:49:34.520 - 00:49:42.140, Speaker A: Like, do you actually believe in crypto and all this stuff, or do you just view it as like a game to stack more numbers on the screen?
00:49:43.880 - 00:50:06.320, Speaker B: A little bit of both. I think it skews more towards that. Crypto as a scam is kind of how I look at it. I do think it's a means to an end. There is a noble cause. At the end of the day, I think bitcoin does have value as a store, as a store of value. I think Ethereum will have value towards the settlement layer for all the smart contract related stuff in the world.
00:50:06.320 - 00:50:41.290, Speaker B: And I think Solana also is okay. It's like a settlement. I don't actually know the text, I'm just yapping here, but I think some core coins have some value at the end of the day. But right now everything's very overvalued. And all these coins that are out of the top ten, like Etherfi L two s, maybe one, will survive to provide a service and it'll find this PMF. But I do think at its core, they're overvalued by anywhere between five to 100 x and their core features for us to gamble on them.
00:50:42.590 - 00:51:04.590, Speaker A: You're right. Right. Yeah. I think the market is catching on. There's so much hate for VC coins. They're like just nuking. And now the people are calling for the memo coin super cycle, which, you know, of course, when price goes down, it looks like that thesis sounds awful, but when price goes up, which I think it will, eventually, people are going to be screaming it off the top of their lungs again.
00:51:04.590 - 00:51:36.698, Speaker A: How do you see this cycle playing out? Of course there's a non zero chance it's over. But assuming that we do see a longer cycle past 25 next year and whatnot, like, will these coins ever pump right? Or do all these farming tokens just trend to zero? Whereas maybe bitcoin needs Solana, some meme coins to go up. Is that kind of like the meta that you foresee in the future? And if so, like, how are we going to, I guess, like, position for it?
00:51:36.874 - 00:51:59.058, Speaker B: I think alts as a whole will trend to zero. It's. I have a strong belief in this, actually. I think most people do. I don't think it's only VC coins. I think all meme coins are actual, actually also headed to zero. So people lied about, like, the new l two being launched because there's too many l two s, but they're apparently not too unhappy about too many meme points existing.
00:51:59.058 - 00:52:32.800, Speaker B: I think meme coins suffer from a similar crisis where there are too many coins and value has to centralize and accrue to some. Some, like, very convincing central thing, in my opinion, that actually turns into, like, some Vc backed or some, like, very institutional thing that represents comedy and memes, not most of these meme coins. So at the end of the day, I do think meme coins will trend to zero and VC coins survive. But most of you see coins will just go to zero outright.
00:52:33.500 - 00:53:08.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the problem is that, you know, all these tokens, like, launch so high, so there's no way for people like you and I to make money off of Etherfi outside of this farming and dumping it. And because everyone just uses Etherfi to farm and dump, token goes down, the vibes deteriorate, and the same happens for everything else. The use case for crypto right now is to bridge to tokenless, l two s, bridge to fake lrts and just dump. That's why on chain gas is sub five almost every single day. You know, there's, like, nothing to do.
00:53:08.486 - 00:53:09.878, Speaker B: It's deflationary again.
00:53:10.054 - 00:53:13.286, Speaker A: Oh, okay, okay, okay. It's at 14 right now. As of.
00:53:13.318 - 00:53:15.358, Speaker B: Oh, it's back down 14. Okay.
00:53:15.494 - 00:53:34.348, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe people are trying to, you know, dump their tokens before the July 4 week. July 4. And then they can. It'll go back to, like, sub three. Yeah, it's kind of. It kind of sucks, right? Like, because I got into crypto, like, believing in attack, and I still believe in attack, you know, I still believe in defi, and I, you know, things like.
00:53:34.348 - 00:53:36.844, Speaker A: Like, things like Aave, I think, has a lot of value.
00:53:36.932 - 00:53:39.188, Speaker B: Well, I think Aave is a future of finance of some sorts.
00:53:39.244 - 00:53:51.284, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it just doesn't go up. Like, these tokens just don't go up. You know, I tried longing maker, and now it's, like, down 50%. Like, from, like, 4k. It's like, damn. Like, there's, like, nothing.
00:53:51.284 - 00:54:03.986, Speaker A: Like, nothing goes up. Like, there's, like, nothing to buy. You know, there's, like, all you can do is farm. But, like, now farming yields have converged. Maybe you buy meme coins, but the ev is. It's definitely minus ev, right. For most opportunities.
00:54:03.986 - 00:54:13.510, Speaker A: So it's like, you know, now people just spend their times complaining on Twitter. It's so sad. It's so sad.
00:54:15.130 - 00:55:01.042, Speaker B: Yeah, well, as I said earlier, that all these coins are a means to an end. I do think some coins will create some long term value. I think even Etherfi, maybe it becomes the retail staking layer, like Lido. Well, the governance token is worthless, but through the governance token, like Etherfi, like, you can reach a lot of retail capture where now you're providing a real service and real cash flow business. Lido makes money from their 10% cut. I think ETFi also takes a 10% cut and that's a real business model. Maybe the token started at billions and went to zero in the process of user onboarding and to become like a Lindy asset where people can trade it or people can use it easily.
00:55:01.042 - 00:55:14.898, Speaker B: But at the end of the day now you have like a 50 billion TVL business that actually works. And, you know, maybe every token, maybe every token buyer lost money, but at least you're a part of this. Well, some journey to a business that's kind of hard.
00:55:15.074 - 00:55:16.746, Speaker A: You're part of the community, you know.
00:55:16.858 - 00:55:18.830, Speaker B: Yeah, we're down money.
00:55:20.130 - 00:55:26.110, Speaker A: Yeah, like, you're down, but everyone else is down, so, you know, it's okay.
00:55:26.650 - 00:55:55.178, Speaker B: That's a shitty thing to say. But I feel like definitely, like people who bought Lido, like, are in for the, not in for. Like, they're at the end of their. They're getting the pride and accomplishment of making Lido price stay higher so that they could reach a wider audience, so that Lido could thrive. So it's like part of the big plan. I think tokens will have to go up to make people feel better about this at some point, and it definitely will. That's kind of like what all season is for, but I don't see it coming anytime soon.
00:55:55.178 - 00:55:57.030, Speaker B: I think the vibes are too bad.
00:55:57.690 - 00:56:27.576, Speaker A: Yeah, vibe is definitely bad. It's like, all I'm doing right now is just like farming. Like, I just hold a shit ton of eth and I'm just like farming with it. And like, I'm not really expecting crazy returns, but it's like, like, what else can I do, you know? Like, I'm not going to sit in stables. I mean, there are decent, stable coin yields, but I still want to believe in the tech and the bull market, and I will choose to continue believe in the tech, in the bull market, whatnot. And speaking of, I guess stop believing.
00:56:27.608 - 00:56:32.720, Speaker B: In it at the end of the bull market. Well, during the bull market.
00:56:32.880 - 00:56:57.630, Speaker A: I mean, at some point, you know, there will be a time and place to sell. And speaking of. Well, I'll still believe in the tech, but I'll be a believer in the stablecoin yields. Yeah. So speaking of which, this is a question. In the next bear, maybe we're in a bear, like a short term bear or whatever. You define that to be basically like a really slow market.
00:56:57.630 - 00:57:18.660, Speaker A: What kind of ApR do you think you can expect with staples or like delta neutral strategies in safe ish protocols? I know it's kind of hard to predict, but, like, do you think it's possible, like if you have a million, you know, can you, do you think you can get like 15% kind of safe? Make one hundred fifty k a year, just live off of that? Do you think that future is possible?
00:57:19.680 - 00:58:10.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I think 15% is going to be doable just because crypto will still remain exo, even if it's a bear market. Like, just less people gambling. But people are gambling and providing TvL, providing capital is basically like you get, you get governance tokens dump for free in exchange for kind of like giving validity to the casino which people are playing on. So you're still going to milk something like 15% somewhere. But this is kind of like the mindset that I grew into over the past six to six months to a year. Is that like next bear market? I will note, like, I just won't farm on chain if it's like 15%, because I think the stress of the exploits that could happen, the stress of managing my positions and whatever, it's not worth 15%. I may as well just touch grass.
00:58:10.950 - 00:58:11.606, Speaker A: Touch grass.
00:58:11.638 - 00:58:15.490, Speaker B: Buy t bills by t bills by, by SPX. Like whatever.
00:58:17.110 - 00:58:53.658, Speaker A: Right, right, yeah. And I think, you know, yeah. Like you mentioned in, I guess the first post, right? Or like early in the podcast where you figured out that in crypto, maybe the best strategy is to just sell, right? Like, learning how to sell is very important. I feel like that's something that I personally struggle with. I think a lot of people struggle with. It's like you're bullish crypto, so you buy stuff and then you're buying the dream, right? Like, you buy something, it might go up like ten x or whatever. It's like, how do you learn? Like, how did you learn to sell? Is it just because you got wrecked? So you're like, okay, like, maybe I should sell.
00:58:53.658 - 00:59:08.370, Speaker A: And then that's kind of like a, you know, a habit that stuck to you. Like, how do you. How do you enjoy selling? Like, do you enjoy selling? Right. Do you enjoy spreading your governance rights to some liquidity?
00:59:08.410 - 00:59:41.232, Speaker B: I like anyway, that governance rights to liquidity pool. Yeah, I don't enjoy selling. I do enjoy numbers going up. So I guess the same thing. I think the reason I learn learn to sell is mostly just because most of my crypto skillset comes from my experience in video games. I don't know if you ever played maplestory, but, oh, yeah, I did. So, like, in general, like, I've been pretty good at, like, what I kind of focus on doing in my life, whatever I want to do.
00:59:41.232 - 01:00:28.206, Speaker B: Well, in my life, I was generally pretty good at kind of like humble brag or kind of like flexing here, but I was, like, not bad at most things that I did. And the last kind of small gig that I did for money before crypto was actually a maple story. I was merging on a, I was like, buying and selling things as a basically core market maker for a private server of maybe like eight to 900 people. And I ran up like $200 to 15 or 20k in like six months. So my experience there is always buy and sell. Buy something for 5% to 10% below the market price and sell it to people who need it badly at 20% above the market price. And that's kind of like how I operated back then, and that's kind of operate now when things feel a little cheap.
01:00:28.206 - 01:00:56.430, Speaker B: When I see a red candle, I just buy some. When I see a green candle, I sell, and I just repeat, repeat this over and over. Of course, I have some. Like, I pretty heavy eth exposure nowadays because I'm pretty bullish. But engraving, my brain is always that you need to sell things because more things will come to you. If I don't keep on selling things to get my money back, people will keep on selling to me, and I'll just have too much inventory. And the only way to go about this is to continue selling.
01:00:56.930 - 01:01:11.024, Speaker A: Interesting. So I guess youre a, you know, with the ETH you have, you're farming, right? Maybe expecting like 20% to 40% returns and then with some capital left over with stables, maybe. I guess you're trading here and there. This is on hyper liquid, right?
01:01:11.152 - 01:01:11.512, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:11.576 - 01:01:25.696, Speaker A: One question I have is, like, I mean, I kind of farmed hyper liquid. I was mostly into HLp vault. And, you know, in hindsight, I wish I farmed it a lot harder. How did you know to farm hyper liquid pretty hard? Like, did you?
01:01:25.728 - 01:01:46.336, Speaker B: Oh, I didn't. I just saw the funding rates and I was like, wow. Like, you're telling me I can borrow etH but with lower margin and also get paid like 20% apr to do so. I was like, wow, like they're giving me free money. So I farmed. So I just use hyper liquid. And then like a week passed, I had like 3000 points and I was like, wow, it'd be really cool if I also got like twenty five cents per point.
01:01:46.336 - 01:02:06.256, Speaker B: That's like another 10% Apr. And I tried to get someone to buy my points for $0.40. They didn't, thank Lord. And like this continued for like three to four weeks. And this is like the start of the bull market. Like beginning of November when things started going up very quickly, funding rates were 100%. So it was vastly profitable to delta neutral form of hyper liquid.
01:02:06.256 - 01:02:39.842, Speaker B: So I just did that and, yeah, and then I had a lot of points actually, I got a lot of points from getting liquidated. So after I tried doing this, so the same problem after I on a really good strategy that sticks for me. I get bored and start trading, like things I want to trade directionally. So I blew up twice, once on UST. Actually I was shorting USD when it was going up from like two cent to $0.06. It got liquidated, my friends. And then I was like, wait, can you, like, I need AFK.
01:02:39.842 - 01:02:55.990, Speaker B: I need to like add margin to my Ust short. And then I added my margin, played for like two minutes. I died, tapped back and I stole the grid. I was like, damn, I just lost like five more, 5000 more dollars. Damn. But I got like 18,000 points that week, so worked out.
01:02:57.370 - 01:03:04.610, Speaker A: Yeah. And so I guess, like you just farmed it out of necessity. I mean, you didn't really farm it. You use the platform because it like helped.
01:03:04.650 - 01:03:08.230, Speaker B: I use the platform to either farm or because it felt like trading.
01:03:08.570 - 01:03:38.250, Speaker A: But I guess you had, and you had all these points and you couldn't sell it for like a low price. So you're like, well, like, there's some demand here. I guess I'll keep farming. And I guess that's kind of how you like, I guess usually you just try a bunch of things, see what works, and then once you find whatever edge that you have, you just like keep going for it. Like, how would you define your edge? Is it just like the video game background and like the, you know, like, yeah. What is your edge, like on chain?
01:03:39.560 - 01:04:08.354, Speaker B: I think I was, I think I, I'm very bored. I think that's my edge. I'm very willing to point things out to find out exactly how things work. For example, for Linea and scroll, I have 1010. I have 20 volts in linear and ten wallets in scroll. Trying different strategies with $1,000 deposited to, like, test what. What emissions, what point emissions each strategy gets.
01:04:08.354 - 01:04:35.090, Speaker B: So I know which ones are optimized. So I kind of, like, know, like, which one is the most cost efficient. In general, I'm not gonna tell any. Well, I don't tell many people, or I don't tell people in general because that's kind of my edge, but so I have a really good idea of, like, how to farm things better than others. I kind of. I sometimes look at the code, like, back in the Ponzi days, I looked at the contracts and kind of, like, found out that there are ways to benefit this, steer this to my. Yeah, make this work in my favor.
01:04:35.090 - 01:04:57.642, Speaker B: I think nowadays more. I think my biggest edge always in crypto or even in these video games, was always that again, I'm very free. I'm a very bored person. I'm willing to dish out, like, 50,000 messages in a discord server very easily. And that makes it really easy for me to make friends. Let me actually look back at this one server. Yeah.
01:04:57.642 - 01:05:27.990, Speaker B: So this server is less than a year old now because we migrated, like, a year ago. This is the server where we talked about Defi with the solidity forks. So it's all leafworks and shit. And I have 75,000 messages in the past year, and I've been pretty inactive the past two months. And this is, like, very normal for me. And this is one of the many servers that I'm active in. So because I'm so talkative and kind of am there all the time, I feel like I've been good at making friends, which has always been a huge positive in crypto.
01:05:28.810 - 01:05:43.790, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. And I guess even scrolling down your twitter, like, you're just like. It's like, sharing your, like, random tweets. It's like, oh, I stake blur and I got $100 a blast. That's a waste. Wait.
01:05:45.530 - 01:05:46.430, Speaker B: That again?
01:05:47.250 - 01:05:47.642, Speaker A: Okay.
01:05:47.666 - 01:05:48.470, Speaker B: Okay, good.
01:05:49.350 - 01:06:04.014, Speaker A: Scrolling down. Scrolling down. You're just, like, tweeting a bunch of random shit. I guess you're also shit posting in discord and. Yeah, I mean, I guess the. The point in crypto is that there's not that many people that show up. So if you actually just show up, then people notice.
01:06:04.014 - 01:06:24.050, Speaker A: Right. I think that's one of the things that I've noticed, too. It's like, I don't really consider myself to be, like, extremely smart, but I've shown up, you know, the past four years. You know, I still make all this content. I experiment with the content, and I think people realize that. And then people tend to be nice to me. And similarly, you know, like, if you.
01:06:24.050 - 01:06:46.996, Speaker A: If you give, you. It's like a give and take, right? Like, you. You share your information, you share good info, and then people are willing to share back, you know? I think that's, like, one of the biggest things that, like, at least for me, that's one of the biggest takeaways from this pod, aside from all your on chain shenanigans, is to just figure out, like, what your edge is. And part of that is just being a nice person.
01:06:47.148 - 01:07:04.460, Speaker B: Yeah, that's my takeaway all the time. I think that's what I usually tell people as well when they ask for edge in crypto. I say, just be nice to people. If you're not an asshole, if you don't scam, whatever, people will like you, and people will be nice to you. And I feel like that's how things went most of my time in crypto.
01:07:04.540 - 01:07:30.720, Speaker A: I guess I have, like, one or two more questions and thank you for your time. It's like, I mean, you're super young, right? I think you're super young, but, like, I guess if you could give advice to a person your age, right? Like, trying to get into crypto now, like, what kind of advice would you have for? Actually, let's let me rephrase that. Like, if you can, like, give advice to, like, you know, yourself, like, three years ago, like, what would it be?
01:07:32.020 - 01:07:36.682, Speaker B: Three years ago would be. That's, like, around when I joined crypto slightly before.
01:07:36.746 - 01:07:37.226, Speaker A: Right, right.
01:07:37.298 - 01:07:42.450, Speaker B: Like, me starting. Is that what you're saying, like, to Andy starting crypto three years ago, what would I tell him?
01:07:42.610 - 01:07:43.338, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:07:43.434 - 01:08:21.640, Speaker B: I feel like I tell him to be more positive. I feel like I got wrecked really badly in the NFT to bear market, starting where, like, my stack or I took a lot of, like, -50% -60% candles to my entire stack where I was very negative and I was not very. But even if I was talkative, I was kind of making friends. I made friends back in the Ponzi days because I was profitable and I was very sharp, not because I was, like, a good person. And if I could go back, I want to be a little bit more wholesome. I feel like I would want to be, like, I would not want to send some messages that I sent in 2022, which was a little bit. A little bit too asshole.
01:08:21.640 - 01:09:10.270, Speaker B: I would want to go back in time and not block some of the people that I blocked in 2022 with the mark saying they were annoying because I was dumping on them. I feel like I just try to make a more productive conversation and try to make more friends because looking back, like a lot of people that farmed the dumb tomb forks with me ended up being the Defi experts. Now, like, that's kind of like the same pool of people who are in crypto who transfer their skills over. So it's a very small world, and I really want to have. I don't want to be friends. I don't need to be friends with everybody, but I definitely want people to not dislike me, and that's kind of, like, my biggest priority. And, yeah, I feel like I've done some things in early 2022, which is definitely a little bit too asshole in the process of making money, and if I could go back, I would do that a little less.
01:09:10.930 - 01:09:39.764, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I guess, like, you know, play. Play long term games with long term people is one of my mottos, I guess. Last question I have for you is around risk management, because, of course, you know, being around on chain throwing, you know, like, millions of dollars, of course, the things you do now. Right. I think the things we do now is not that risky, honestly. It's like, maybe looping etherfi is kind of risky because your health factor is, like, 1.02,
01:09:39.764 - 01:10:11.890, Speaker A: but it's okay because I think it's, like, hard coded or. Yeah, and, you know, you're not really gonna get liquidated. But I guess there's always elements. There's always elements of risk in defi. Right? So how do you think about risk? Are you comfortable just, like, yeeting all your stack into etherfyth, like, looping it? Or would you rather just spread it out across different chains? So you're somewhat diversified. Can you just talk about how you think about risk being on chain, because it's not zero, never zero.
01:10:12.910 - 01:10:35.492, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely do diversify a lot now. I diversify between wallets. I've. I used to have, like, one or two public wallets. Now there's, like, three or four public wallets and a dozen ones that I don't even, like, mention different assets. I love ether five, but it's not the only asset that I use. I try to use different things with different assets, use different protocols.
01:10:35.492 - 01:11:03.750, Speaker B: Different chains definitely is the case. And I've also off ramped enough money where I feel like if my entire on chain thing went bust and I just went to, like, straight up zero on crypto. I have enough money to, like, kind of, like, well, I'd be very sad. I'd be crushed. But I have enough room to, like, look back, kind of, like, calm down, and think about, like, what I can do going forward. It wouldn't be like, my life is over. And I think also having the confidence.
01:11:03.750 - 01:11:34.772, Speaker B: Well, this is kind of, like, separate, but I think having the confidence in myself that, like, I'm smart, which kind of, like, got reinforced as I have any money in crypto makes me think that, like, yeah, like, worst case, I have, like, whatever stack I offer and then whatever I have whatever portfolio that I have in real life besides crypto, like, now, and I would just go get a job. Maybe I'll unramp again and do crypto again. If I ever get hacked for everything that I have and say I need to unramp everything that I've left my life and do crypto again, please stop me. But.
01:11:34.876 - 01:11:35.148, Speaker A: Okay.
01:11:35.164 - 01:11:43.920, Speaker B: Okay. I'll stop you and go to life. Like, it was a nice arc. I made good money. Even if I die here. Yeah. Like, if everything actually dies here.
01:11:45.060 - 01:11:54.148, Speaker A: Right, right. Got it. Yeah, yeah. Just let's. Let me know if you ever, you know, feel like you have to on ramp a bunch of money. Like, I. Yeah.
01:11:54.148 - 01:12:37.450, Speaker A: Like, we're in, like, that one discord, right? And I think there was. There's, like, that one member, I think he, for, like, whatever reason, he was using, like, a hot wallet for everything, and then he, like, got wrecked, and then he, like, disappeared. It's, like, there's, like, so many of these sad stories that people don't really hear about. Right, because there's a lot of survivorship bias in crypto. You know, you only hear about, you know, like, you know, people making a shit ton of money from meme coins and, like, you know, on chain, but you don't hear about thousands of people that got, like, destroyed on whatever, like, random meme coin or, like, random tomb fork rug, or, you know, like, whatever, phishing attack, right? So definitely use a hardware wallet. Like, please. Like, that's.
01:12:37.450 - 01:12:47.054, Speaker A: It's. It's 2024. There's no. There's no excuse for not having a hardware wallet. That's one of the. One of the things I want to share. That's gonna be it.
01:12:47.182 - 01:13:22.250, Speaker B: Biggest changes that I've been making is that I actually used to use, like, I just have a separate laptop for every new wallet that was, like, for the first four or five wallets that I had, I was, like, I can't do this anymore. I just. Wallets for all the new ones. I still have like bits and pieces left in my old wallets where they're technically hot wallets on a, on a laptop that I only use for crypto. But I've been trying to go to better practices because 2024 has been kind of like my calm down, risk manage. And of course there's edge, there's, there's ways to outperform, there's ways. There are pools around getting like 500% APR.
01:13:22.250 - 01:13:30.330, Speaker B: But in the big, the big picture is kind of to stabilize and to look for. Look forward to the future.
01:13:31.630 - 01:14:02.510, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, thanks for your time, Andy. One last question is, you know, like, my audience, I think, tends to be more defi native on chain native, but they want to make it, like, what tips do you have? You know, I mean, you already mentioned like slinging around share coins, but maybe a more humble. More humble tips, more humble advice that doesn't involve like slinging shitcoins. Like how do you, how can someone make it, you know, in, let's say in the next twelve months, some words of advice.
01:14:05.130 - 01:14:38.074, Speaker B: Be attentive. I think not. I think, but as a fact, if you're on top of things, you'll find ways to upfront a the market and find things that are very clearly loopholes where you could get outsized gains relatively easily. Crypto is not that sophisticated. The teams that are vc backed are not the smartest people and, or there are very smart people. But some of these things don't have very smart people or very smart mechanisms and you'll be able to exploit it for your benefit where you will be basically compounding your stack like 0.5%, 1% a day.
01:14:38.074 - 01:14:58.998, Speaker B: And now like even go get away with that for one month. Now you 1.5 extra stack very easily. So kind of, kind of against what you're saying. But if you have ten k, it's going to be a long road ahead. It's going to require a lot of like. It's going to require a lot of like tiered airdrops, good symbol tactics, whatever, for you to initially get a good stack to work with.
01:14:58.998 - 01:15:09.420, Speaker B: But if you even have like 100k, there are definitely ways to make things happen and make, make very acceptable and very good outsized gains.
01:15:10.480 - 01:15:14.680, Speaker A: Yeah, because I guess like, sorry, say it again. Aerodrome.
01:15:14.760 - 01:15:31.870, Speaker B: Aerodrome. It is so inspirational. I think if you're attentive and like base and knew about what aerodrome was, there are definitely ways for you to even without being like very risk on get away with like basically plus 30 to plus 30, plus 50% your stack in like two months.
01:15:32.490 - 01:15:54.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I mid curve aerodrome so much I farmed it day one since September. I was like in the ETh USDC pool. And then it went down 90% as all coins do. It pumped like $0.08. It pumped like $0.10. I'm like, bro, I made it. I dumped arrow for like $7,000 or whatever.
01:15:54.146 - 01:16:15.018, Speaker A: I was like, yo, this is sicken. And then it went to like $3 or like, whatever, right? I was like, fuck. Like, how did I not see this coming? You know? Like, aerodrome was a chosen child, you know? But I was like, how did you know to long arrow? Like, were you longing arrow? Like, where is this farming arrow? Like to pull one, pool two. Like, what were you doing? How did you know?
01:16:15.194 - 01:16:44.800, Speaker B: I farmed a lot of arrow? So I didn't know. Actually, when the Coinbase listing happened, I dumped it all at actually had like a million arrow tokens. And it dumped it all at like the initial pump to then a little bit more eight. But there was a day like, I think the first day of East Denver where I was actually like going, going to an event. And then I saw like a tweet saying like, coinbase Ventures has invested in aerodrome. I was like, yeah, like, easy. I like, tweeted this, like, look, it's this easy.
01:16:44.800 - 01:17:05.310, Speaker B: And I bought a lot of airdrome and I sold a lot on the way up. I actually was done selling by like $0.60, so I didn't make that much money. But it is a pretty clear signal where if Coinbase Ventures is investing in a back then $5 million market cap token or $8 million market cap token, it's going to go up.
01:17:06.370 - 01:17:18.840, Speaker A: Damn, I did not see that coming in my head. It's just like, all solid leaf works are just farming dumb tokens. But, you know, sometimes you just want to hold, you know?
01:17:19.340 - 01:17:24.400, Speaker B: Next time I will. I will fly to New York and put a gun to your head and say hold.
01:17:25.340 - 01:17:27.116, Speaker A: Or like, no, like, buy more.
01:17:27.268 - 01:17:27.940, Speaker B: Buy more.
01:17:28.020 - 01:17:41.676, Speaker A: I need you to do that for me, man. I need some hand holding. I'm just. I'm just like, farming Etherfy. And I'm like, bro, like, I'm gonna get like $10. It's like, fuck. And then even farming squirrel, I'm like, damn.
01:17:41.676 - 01:17:52.200, Speaker A: Like, tv all triple dollars. I'll get $12. I'm like, yes, okay, okay. 20% increase. Like, that's great. And then, yeah, it's. Yeah.
01:17:52.200 - 01:18:11.218, Speaker A: Anyways, I forgot what we were talking about. Yeah. Advice. No. Then we kind of got distracted with aerodrome because I totally forgot about aerodrome. I still cope to this day, you know, it's like, fuck. Um, yeah.
01:18:11.234 - 01:18:27.230, Speaker B: But I think stuff like aerodrome, like the being attentive, you'll find some edges. You don't even need to, like, buy this aerodrome token. You just need to, like, farm it after it starts going up. You're like, yeah, like, doesn't look that bad. It's the same thing as buying, but it feels a lot better when you farm it for free than when you versus when you buy.
01:18:27.930 - 01:19:29.290, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like, nowadays it's so hard to find something to farm that actually goes up in price, right? So I guess, like, now, right, because it's like the euthanasia roller coaster where stark launches at 20 billion, then Zksync is like 8 billion, and then, like, you know, the last scroll probably launches lower. It's like every future token expectation just keeps going down. So now instead of, like, trying to farm something to, like, dump day one, I'm more looking to farm things to accumulate, right? Like, farm maybe hold for like, six months, twelve months, if I can form some bull case on the team and maybe look for 100 xs there post farming. That's the mindset shift that I'm trying to go towards. The problem is it's so hard to find good teams tokens that's not over farmed. There are, I think, select opportunities, and that's my shift. And I'm also looking to buy Defi tokens soon.
01:19:29.290 - 01:19:30.354, Speaker A: Maybe.
01:19:30.402 - 01:19:33.910, Speaker B: Aave will definitely go up. Lido will definitely go up. Yes.
01:19:34.530 - 01:19:47.150, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, I have an entire thesis on Aave. It's just that buying it is so hard, you know, like, because there's a chance that it just, like, doesn't go up, like, the next year. And then the opportunity cost for airdrop farming with Eid.
01:19:49.690 - 01:19:50.830, Speaker B: Like, 30%.
01:19:51.130 - 01:20:04.904, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like, really, really high. But I guess if the expected return for future airdrop farming with Ethan goes down, there's less of an opportunity cost. So maybe that drives more capital towards, like, buying altcoins. Like, boring.
01:20:04.952 - 01:20:09.860, Speaker B: The markets will converge, something like that. And RDside tokens will surely go up.
01:20:10.360 - 01:20:13.540, Speaker A: Yeah, that's my coping mechanism.
01:20:14.480 - 01:20:19.960, Speaker B: Oh, actually, one thing that I didn't talk about that is probably alpha and could be useful to people who have small.
01:20:20.000 - 01:20:20.768, Speaker A: There you go.
01:20:20.944 - 01:20:41.248, Speaker B: Is actually meme coin. LPdd on Solana. This thing goes crazy. Like, I think buying meme, you don't need to buy them if you. If you have friends. I think this is the hard part. If you have friends who will lend you their meme coins and you lp it on radium, you get insane ApRs for LP'ing on radium if the volume is high.
01:20:41.248 - 01:21:13.808, Speaker B: I think for Billy right now, if you make the Solana like radium LP full range, you get 800% APR, two, a little bit over 2% a day in fees. And their permanent loss is like, the coin moves at 40, 50% a day maximum. If you balance every 10% increment, which is, like, a pretty significant increment, then you only lose, like, 0.7%. So you're making 1.3% on your full stack or the full stack of the lp that you have every single day. I am actually doing this. I had.
01:21:13.808 - 01:21:26.788, Speaker B: I had somebody lend me a little bit of Billy, and I did this. It wasn't. It's not vastly profitable. I made, like, $400 on 25K, but it feels good. I made. I made 1.6%. It feels.
01:21:26.788 - 01:21:37.756, Speaker B: It feels great. So I. I just. Stuff like this to feel alive. And I think if people have the effort and if they're locked in, they don't have many things to do to, like. Yeah. If you're.
01:21:37.756 - 01:21:44.730, Speaker B: If you're at home anyways, kind of like locked in on crypto, this is one of the options that people could take for relatively outsized returns.
01:21:45.830 - 01:22:09.360, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Crypto no longer offers, like, an easy way to make money. Right? Like, you have to really work for it, which is good, I think. There's no free lunch, but it takes a lot of work to get outsize returns to this outperform eat or something.
01:22:10.700 - 01:22:23.156, Speaker B: Yeah. And if everybody, anybody, like, listening to this podcast has questions about Defi, I feel like they can just hit me up. Usually telegram is much easier. Sometimes discord. I do answer. I just don't answer Twitter DM's, so.
01:22:23.228 - 01:22:24.116, Speaker A: No, really?
01:22:24.268 - 01:22:27.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't. I don't read Twitter DM's or I don't answer them at least.
01:22:28.620 - 01:22:35.200, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, wait. Do you mind? Okay, and wait. Actually, like, if you share your telegram, you're gonna get spammed.
01:22:35.770 - 01:22:39.554, Speaker B: My telegram is my Twitter handle, so if they want to reach me, they can.
01:22:39.602 - 01:22:40.430, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
01:22:41.650 - 01:22:42.950, Speaker B: I don't care that much.
01:22:43.450 - 01:22:45.570, Speaker A: I guess you just block them. Delete the chat or something.
01:22:45.610 - 01:22:46.906, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just block them.
01:22:47.098 - 01:23:07.146, Speaker A: Okay. There you go. Right. Just, you know, you're. After this episode, there's. You're probably gonna get, like, hundreds of DM's. Like, hey, like, what are you forming? What are you forming? What are you shorting? What are your longing? So hopefully you'll respond to, like, the more sophisticated, sophisticated questions and not like, the, you know, people trying to tikey.
01:23:07.178 - 01:23:12.074, Speaker B: I'll try to answer all of them since I basically put myself up for hire here. So.
01:23:12.162 - 01:23:12.754, Speaker A: Okay.
01:23:12.882 - 01:23:14.994, Speaker B: My duty to answer for a bit, at least.
01:23:15.162 - 01:23:30.000, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. There you go. Right. I do some positive good for the community, I swear. You know, Andy, he did ghost me for three months, so he owes me this. He owes me three days of responding to DM's, at least.
01:23:30.000 - 01:23:37.092, Speaker A: So if you're an onchain Degen, just, I guess the DMM on Twitter or, sorry, dmm on telegram.
01:23:37.156 - 01:23:38.716, Speaker B: Yeah, not Twitter, telegram.
01:23:38.868 - 01:23:43.044, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Thanks, man. This was a good conversation.
01:23:43.212 - 01:23:51.068, Speaker B: It was kind of nice looking back and thinking, like, talking about what I think is also very beneficial to me as well. It was a great time.
01:23:51.244 - 01:24:00.560, Speaker A: Yeah. Also, like, you know. Yeah. Like, when I, whenever I make videos, I have to, like, you know, obviously talk. Right. For a long time. So it helps me solidify some ideas that I have.
01:24:00.560 - 01:24:18.200, Speaker A: And then sometimes I'm like, wait, like that. That sounds stupid. And then I'm like, okay. Like, I should not be, like, you know, in this form or like, whatever. So it's always helpful to at least, you know, bounce ideas off of each other. And I think for the audience, too, you know, I think you said a bunch of stuff. Hopefully, you know, it doesn't go over people's heads.
01:24:18.200 - 01:24:43.270, Speaker A: I think. I think it was generally pretty easy to understand. Maybe, like, the ptyd stuff earlier was kind of difficult, but, um, you know, it's, it's good stuff. I think l two s as the new pancake swap forks makes sense, you know, and maybe they all just deserve to converge to zero, which I think is healthy. You know, like, just, like, just dump. Dump all the vaporware to zero and then see what comes out on the other, on the other side.
01:24:44.930 - 01:24:52.676, Speaker B: I really shouldn't say that for my own bags and my, yeah, well, not.
01:24:52.708 - 01:24:56.772, Speaker A: All l two tokens. Right? Like, you know, there will be select winners, but everybody.
01:24:56.796 - 01:24:58.200, Speaker B: Yeah. Especially my bags.
01:24:58.620 - 01:25:01.036, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, it's okay.
01:25:01.188 - 01:25:05.484, Speaker B: Good talk. I'll probably see you next month if you're in New York next month, so.
01:25:05.612 - 01:25:09.420, Speaker A: All right, sounds good. All right, thanks, Andy.
01:25:09.540 - 01:25:10.868, Speaker B: Yeah, good talk. Have a good day.
01:25:11.004 - 01:25:27.958, Speaker A: Yeah. Bye bye. Thanks for watching, and I hope you enjoyed the content.
