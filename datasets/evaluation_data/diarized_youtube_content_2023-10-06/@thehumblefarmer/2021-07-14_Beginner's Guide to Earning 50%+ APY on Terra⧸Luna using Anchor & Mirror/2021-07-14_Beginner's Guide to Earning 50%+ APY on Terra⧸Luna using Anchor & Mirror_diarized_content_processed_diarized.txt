00:00:00.320 - 00:00:29.447, Speaker A: What is up guys? Tyche here. Today I'll be going over two strategies that you can employ on the Tarot ecosystem to earn 50 to 60% APY on your assets. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Alright, so I've kind of foreshadowed on my channel that I'll be going over the Terra ecosystem more, right? For my last five videos were on Terra and today I just wanted like, I guess lay out on a spreadsheet like my actual strategy. Just so you can kind of understand it better, right? Because I'm doing many, many things.
00:00:29.447 - 00:01:07.925, Speaker A: But if you lay it out like this, it becomes more simple. It might not seem simple now, but throughout the video you'll understand it better. So I'll go over the strategy I'm employing right now as well as a pure stablecoin strategy if you don't want exposure to Luna. So before I get into the actual strategy, I'm just going to briefly go over how I bridge my assets from Polygon to the Terra ecosystem. Because I mostly cover Apollon. So essentially, as you can see here, I ported essentially all my stable coins from Polygon to Terra, right? As you can see here. And the way I did this is that I essentially took all my stable coins and swapped it for USD on the Define.
00:01:07.925 - 00:01:27.651, Speaker A: Define amm right? This is D U F Y N Exchange. That's the website. Because there's liquidity for USD here and you can't use assets like USDC on Terra because it's not I. It's not native to Terra. You need USD or Luna. There's not that much liquidity for Luna. There's a lot more liquidity for USD.
00:01:27.651 - 00:02:04.893, Speaker A: So I just took all my stable coins, swapped it for UST and I used the Polygon bridge to just take my USC from Polygon to Eth and after I did that I just took use the Terror bridge, right? So you have to do multiple steps. This the website is bridge.terra. money of just taking my UST here and then bridging from Ethereum to Terra, right? Pretty simple. Transaction fees are pretty low, so it wasn't too difficult, but that's what you had to do. Okay, so that being said, let's go back into the strategy of like how I'm actually doing this. So like I mentioned, I initially bridged over 16.4, 16.4k
00:02:04.893 - 00:02:40.139, Speaker A: to Terra. So what did I do with that to earn this much, I guess yield? So this is the layout of the Strategy essentially converted $6.4K of stable coins to Luna, right? Because I just wanted a little bit of exposure to Luna because I guess I felt a little frisky. And there's things you can do with Luna when you use it as collateral to borrow against it. And then I deposited whatever I had remaining into anchor, earning 20%. And then I can use Aust, which is my claim on my anchor deposit, as collateral to Short Farm on mirror. So let's.
00:02:40.139 - 00:03:09.477, Speaker A: Okay, too much talking. Let's actually go into how I'm doing this. So like I mentioned, this used to be 6.4k. Obviously the markets are down a little, so I knowingly took this risk. But it's okay because I wanted to do this because I can use my collateral to borrow against it, right? So it's like aave, you put something as collateral, you borrow dollars against it. And the borrowed value, which is $1,500, which I think is a relatively safe amount, I'm going to be liquidated if the price hits 3.6, which is totally possible.
00:03:09.477 - 00:03:28.581, Speaker A: But you know, I'm. I'm feeling a little frisky, like I said. So the borrow APR is 15%. So this is how much interest I'm paying Anchor to borrow this much. But because Anchor has these liquidity mining programs, they're paying you 110% to. They're paying you 110% to borrow. So my net APR is 95%.
00:03:28.581 - 00:04:06.381, Speaker A: Right. So this is how much I'm earning on Anchor on this much, right. How much I'm borrowing, which is, you can see here, I'm paying 15%, under 10%, I'm borrowing this much. So if this rate stays the same, I'm going to earn fourteen hundred dollars roughly by the end of the year. Obviously it's going to fluctuate, but in the time being, this is the math, right? So I have $1,500 of USD that I borrowed as well as the $10,000 of USD that I have remaining. I deposited everything into Anchor here. You can't see it because I wish I didn't withdraw.
00:04:06.381 - 00:04:39.077, Speaker A: I'm using it as collateral somewhere. And like now you don't really see it, but you can see that on Saturday, June, July 10, I deposited 11K, right. And I redeemed some because I earned a bunch of interest. And you need UST for transaction fees, right? Or just any assets transaction fees. So I just like wish drew them. So as you can see, I know this might sound a little confusing, but I started with 16 4k. I bought 6 4k of Luna, borrowed this much against it, earning this much interest.
00:04:39.077 - 00:05:06.237, Speaker A: With the remaining 10,000 and the 1500 I put 11,500. Right. Total, right. This ad, and that is earning me 20% interest, which is $2,300. And now I'm going to use this as collateral on the Mirror Protocol. Because right now on the Mirror Protocol there are these two things that you can do called long and short form. Where if you're a long form is like providing liquidity and basically earning swap fees and Mirror tokens.
00:05:06.237 - 00:05:44.155, Speaker A: And when you short form, you literally short an asset and you get paid to short, right? So let's get into the asset that I'm shorting and how I'm actually doing this. So let's get into the tutorial right now. All right, so let's get into how you can actually shorten asset on Mirror Protocol. So you have to do multiple steps. First you put something as collateral, right? Because when you short something on Mirror, you put an asset as collateral, you borrow against it and you immediately sell the borrowed asset in the market hoping to buy back lower, right? That's the definition of shorting in this case. I don't really care if Gold goes down. I'm just choosing gold because it's the least volatile asset available.
00:05:44.155 - 00:06:25.283, Speaker A: So the cool thing about Mirror is you can use a USD collider, right? So this, this figure you see here is essentially my claim on this much, right, 11 and a half dol, which is appreciating 20% a year. So like my collateral is appreciating roughly 20% a year and I can use that as collateral and I can borrow against it. Then you set a collateral ratio and you're going to be liquidated below the minimum, which is 150% and the safe amount is 200%. Obviously this depends on like the asset you're choosing. For me personally, I'm going to choose 180%. Though this might seem risky just by looking at this bar, if you actually do the math, it's not that risky. So I did a little simulation here.
00:06:25.283 - 00:07:13.505, Speaker A: So if I set my collateral ratio to 180% and hypothetically I choose collateral as $10,000, just like using numbers, I know I'm using 11k, but I mean it's math, right? It doesn't really matter what the numbers are. I'm just trying to capture how much gold would have to go up in order for me to get liquidated. So If I use 180% collateral ratio for $10,000, I can borrow this much. And in order for me to get liquidated at 150%, the gold would have to appreciate to $6,667. And the percent growth from this figure to this figure is 20%. So essentially gold would have to go up 20% in like a matter of days in order for me to get liquidated, which is very unlikely. And keep in mind that my collateral is also growing 20% in value.
00:07:13.505 - 00:07:43.861, Speaker A: Right. So if gold actually goes up 20% in the next year, my collateral ratio would remain the same. Right. Do you get the point? So, you know, under 80%, I feel comfortable with this. And with this ratio, I can mint this much in my mirrored iau, which I'm going to directly sell and I'm going to get to mint $6,500. So because I'm short borrowing an asset, selling it directly, I'll be earning these dollars and these dollars I can put back into the anchor protocol. Right.
00:07:43.861 - 00:08:01.039, Speaker A: Or I can use it to long farm. So it also gives you the flexibility. It's locked for two weeks to prevent spam attacks, I believe. But that's how you do it. And then you know, it has, has these things. You agree and then you sign the transaction and there you go. That's how you short an asset on mirror.
00:08:01.039 - 00:08:16.385, Speaker A: Right. In this case, gold. So hopefully this was helpful. And now, yeah, I'm earning 45% on gold. Shorting gold. Cool. All right, back to the spreadsheet.
00:08:16.385 - 00:08:36.177, Speaker A: Okay, so sorry if it's confusing, but I essentially shorted $6,500 worth of gold, which I'm being paid 45% and that's earning me roughly $2,900. Right. And in two weeks. Right. In 14 days, the $6,500 will be unlocked. Right. Because when I short an asset, I'm borrowing it and then selling it.
00:08:36.177 - 00:08:58.663, Speaker A: Right. So when I sell it, I get USD in return. So with the $6,500, I'm going to most likely do a long farm on mirror. Right. It depends what the best rates are going to be in two weeks. But most likely I might just like long the same amount of gold so I can remain delta neutral. Or I might just like long, like the nasdaq.
00:08:58.663 - 00:09:17.327, Speaker A: I don't know. We'll see. I'll update you when the time comes. Or if you're, if you want to be more risk averse, you can take the 60 $500 and redeposit it back into the anchor earned deposit. Right. So there's a lot there's a lot of things you can do on the Terra ecosystem just on anchor in the mirror protocol. Right.
00:09:17.327 - 00:09:30.727, Speaker A: There's so much flexibility. So hopefully this made sense. So on my initial capital, my annual income should be roughly $8600. Yeah, roughly. Right. And I do have exposure to the Luna token. Right.
00:09:30.727 - 00:10:03.455, Speaker A: So right now Luna is down like roughly 10, like roughly 10% or something ever since I purchased it, which is like not great. But I didn't want to speculate on the price of Luna. And you know, I'm earning like 90%, 95% APR, sorry, APY on anchor tokens. Right. So by using Luna's collateral, barring against it, I'm essentially increasing my anchor stack. Right. Because you know, if you're bullish Terra, then it kind of makes sense to farm all these tokens.
00:10:03.455 - 00:10:24.149, Speaker A: So yeah, hopefully that made sense. Let me know if you have any questions. And I think this is like the easiest way to lay it out, right? Just like using a table, like all that, this math. But let me know if that makes sense. So but what if you said like I don't want to speculate on the price Luna, I don't want to go over, I don't want to use this step to like borrow against it. Right. This seems awfully dangerous.
00:10:24.149 - 00:10:50.731, Speaker A: If Bitcoin dumps, then I might get liquidated. And that's a totally valid, valid argument. So what if you just purely wanted to just use stablecoins? Well, you see here, right? So let's say 16 4k, right? At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what the number is, right? Because the rate of return is going to remain the same, right? Because math amazing. You can trust me. So let's just say you just put everything into anchor, right? 16.4 K of UST, right. And then you're earning that much.
00:10:50.731 - 00:11:22.037, Speaker A: Well, you can use 16.4K as collateral on mirror to short form, right. I mean, same thing, go back to spreadsheet. So let's just say you like short $8,000 worth, right? Because you want to maintain like a safe collateral ratio. And then assuming that you know, these rates stay the same, then you can earn $3,600. And then once the short funds are unlocked, you can long from it again. Or if you're even like more risk averse, you can take the $8,000, put it back into the anchor earned deposit and do that.
00:11:22.037 - 00:11:59.415, Speaker A: Right? So you can do this. You can do this as well, right? And it's still 50%. So you know, there are many things you can do on the Terra ecosystem. This is why I wanted to just move all my stable coins there, right? And I also purchased some Luna token just because, I don't know, I'm a Degen or something. So let me know if that made sense. I think this is a pretty good overview of what you can do on mirror, right? And also I'm like earning anchor tokens here, right? I'm earning anchor tokens. So over time, as I earn $200 with anchor tokens, it's not that much, but I'm also farming it for free.
00:11:59.415 - 00:12:27.357, Speaker A: And if you go to the. Let's see, if you go to the Govern tab, whatever mirror token you earn, you can stake it here for 15% APR. So the actual number here might be higher, right? Obviously you're being paid in anchor and mirror tokens and if these values go down, then the APRs go down. But if it goes up, then the APIs also go up. Thank you guys for watching the video. Hope this was helpful. Just laying it out on the table like this.
00:12:27.357 - 00:12:30.245, Speaker A: Thank you guys for watching and have a nice day. Farming.
