00:00:00.800 - 00:00:20.310, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Humble farmer Taiki here and welcome to this week's edition of Farms of the week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out. The premium discord link will be in the description below. Prices will be going up at the beginning of next month, so let's get right into it. So, you know, it seems like the meta has been points. Points. I do think airdrop farming is the new yield farming.
00:00:20.310 - 00:01:01.494, Speaker A: I think the market is too smart and market has, I guess, is educated enough to understand that inflationary token incentives not going to be worth it. So instead of giving up tokens, let's give out points. Wherever the value of these points can't go down, they can only go up. And you know, I think if you're a dev, it makes sense, right? It's game theory optimal to just introduce points if you're a farmer, right? Like, it's kind of annoying, right? This is, this meme here of this, this anime guy just in distress because of all these points with all new wallets, new protocols, it makes no sense. And today, I mean this morning, like maybe. Yeah. Like a couple minutes ago it was announced that drift from Solana, they're also going to introduce a point system.
00:01:01.494 - 00:01:29.028, Speaker A: So I read through the comments section, every single video. It's like, why is Tyke not covering Solana? Is he an Eth Maxi? Look, I'm not an Eth Maxi, okay? In fact, I'm far away from it. So drift, I think, is a really interesting protocol. So, not this, but yeah. They raised $23.5 million for an application that's pretty impressive. Usually anything that raises over $20 million, it's usually for some type of l one or l two.
00:01:29.028 - 00:01:48.260, Speaker A: So the fact that drift raised this much money, I think is very promising. And, you know, I met, I think his name is David. And I also met Cindy. I went to Aslana Hackathon. I think the team is extremely sharp. So I definitely think that this is worth farming. And I'll be farming it, to be honest, whenever more information is publicized.
00:01:48.260 - 00:02:21.414, Speaker A: So drift is planning to launch their token shortly after the point squarem wrapping up in March. So that's what Cindy said. And in order for you to receive these points, you have to do some volume on drift. So, you know, trade or just market make or provide liquidity. So, you know, I'm not really a great trader, at least short term, right. I don't really have an edge like guessing where the market's gonna go in the short term. I'm more in the camp of, you know what? Like, let's let the Ga, like, the DJ's gamble on these tokens or, like, price, price of these tokens and then collect the fees by being an LP.
00:02:21.414 - 00:02:52.786, Speaker A: So that's definitely something that I'll be doing. You know, hyper liquid is also one of these, I guess, protocols with the point system. And, you know, if you go on Twitter, right, or just any social media, everyone's gonna claim how much money they're making, whatnot. But, you know, the data don't lie, right? Like, they introduce point system. People are trading and they're just getting wrecked. And if you think about it, I mean, in this time span, the markets have mostly been up only, right, except the past couple of days. So, you know, I talked about this in my podcast with Jason Moe last week.
00:02:52.786 - 00:03:42.410, Speaker A: But if you're making any money in the markets, then you're doing better than most people, right? Don't let mid curves like me or other mid curves on the Internet make you feel bad because, I mean, I guess I'm a mid curve. So there's no way that you can feel bad about my performance because I am literally in the mid curve. But just be aware that, yeah, points are cool, but this is how protocols, if you introduce a point system as a dev, you're basically farming the farmers. Even the manta airdrop people were pretty upset by it. You know, like, I did this poll, and this is a really bad way to run a poll, right. This is literally selection bias because the only people that's gonna vote for this type of protocol, like this type of poll, is people that's either really, really pissed or really, really happy and, like, nowhere in between. So this is like a very.
00:03:42.410 - 00:04:12.120, Speaker A: Not like a good way to collect the sample, but, you know, I just did it for the hell of it. And it seems like people are generally upset and, you know, they also, you know, let's keep farming engagement by saying, you know, celeste, stakers, yada yada, fake promises. Farmers are being farmed. So don't be a farmer, right? I mean, be a farmer, but don't be a farmer that gets farmed. Just be really. Or just. Just be aware that protocols are just going to keep pushing these airdrops off way into the future and they're going to keep giving away points.
00:04:12.120 - 00:04:49.610, Speaker A: But, you know, like, that's a way for them to generate revenue, right? Because if you're trading on a per protocol, they're going to profit off of you. If you're lending assets or borrowing assets on the money market, they're making money off of you and they're just giving away these fake tokens. But, you know, I think it makes sense to be selective. For example, I think drift is going to be worth. Or the drift tokens can be worth a pretty decent amount. And if you go to the protocol, of course you can trade, but I'm not really a fan of trading. I think you'll be receiving points if you provide liquidity in DLP so you can deposit capital into, I guess, bitcoin, either these vaults and then collect fees.
00:04:49.610 - 00:05:22.474, Speaker A: It's unavailable because I'm based in the US, unfortunately. Um, and there's also these market making vaults. I think these are more delta neutral where you can deposit a stable coin and then collect these apYs, I think. Right. I talked to Cindy about this. I think they're going to slowly try to phase this one out because DLP, this is a vam. And look, you know, I mentioned this before, I'm a mid curve, right? So like, don't expect me to, you know, explain everything, but I am pretty aware with vamms and they are pretty dangerous.
00:05:22.474 - 00:05:58.984, Speaker A: So if you follow me. This was back in. Yeah, like back Q three or Q two? Q three of last year. But I was doing this thing where I was just, you know, doing this scheme, I guess. I mean, it's not really a scheme because I mean, anyone could have done this, but there were these NfT perp amms and they were all V amms and both of them, they shut down their protocol or they shut down their v one because the system was not sustainable and the way it works. And I'm not saying that this is how drift works because I mean, you know, NFT perks don't really make sense because it's very illiquid. I mean, I'm sure at some point it'll make sense.
00:05:58.984 - 00:06:47.882, Speaker A: But there was this situation where, you know, with most per protocols, it's not really backed by any asset. And especially with NFT perps, of course, like you can't really back like a long position or a short position with like actual nfts. It doesn't really work that way. So let's say the price of a bored ape was 30 and the price of bored apes on this perp platform was like 35 or something because the platform needs to get it down to 30. It's going to incentivize people to short, it's going to incentivize new people to come in and short the price of bored apes. So the price goes down and the way that these per platforms incentivize is by paying out funding. And all the funding fees came directly from the insurance free, like the insurance fund for all these platforms.
00:06:47.882 - 00:07:26.250, Speaker A: So because the price of bored apes kept going down, I just continued shorting bored apes and I was making money from the short. And also, you know, I was also collecting funding directly from these, like these insurance funds. So I was like making money like both on the shorting and also on the funding side, of course. You know, at some point both platforms were like, yeah, like, okay, like tyke is just like stealing money, right? Taking eth away from our insurance fund, which came from the VC's, right. And like angel investors and whatnot. So it was a transfer of wealth from angel investors to Taiki Maeda. I made like 5678, I think, off of this.
00:07:26.250 - 00:08:13.160, Speaker A: And obviously it's not a sustainable design. And I was like, yeah, good for them for admitting that they made a mistake or they tried something and it didn't work. So I'm not saying that it works exactly the same way, but basically with vmms, it's virtual amms. So none of these assets are backed by actual, I guess, coins, physical coins. So, you know, just be aware that it's somewhat dangerous. One of our humble farm army members, I mean, I'm not going to read through this, but you know, just understand that it's not like risk free, right? There's, I mean, you know, if any platform is offering you like really high AP wise above, I guess, like the risk free rate, whether it be, you know, treasury bills or I guess, the eat staking rate, there is always additional elements of risk. So just something to be aware of.
00:08:13.160 - 00:08:55.628, Speaker A: But I think, you know, I mean, that's the risk with DLP, but I think they're going to phase that out. I'm going to be more, more interested in like these supercharger vaults where like maybe I'll deposit some stable coins. I might as well, maybe I'll even, you know, deposit some capital into Camino, borrow against it, and then deposit into drift, right? So I can farm both points. Same could go for margin Phi. I'm not a huge fan of these money markets. I made a video two years ago actually evaluating why money market tokens or borrow lend market protocols. These tokens just get dumped on because they don't really make that much money.
00:08:55.628 - 00:09:29.564, Speaker A: And the only value, I think will only accrue to these blue chips like Aave or maker or maybe not even compound. All these aave forks that introduce inflationary token incentives to get TVL I mean, like, who the hell wants to hold onto these tokens? So, I mean, I know a lot of people farming this. I mean, if you're farming it, you get coins, you dump it to accumulate more soul or bitcoin or ether or stable coins. Yeah, like, you should do it. But I am fully aware that, you know, these tokens are just getting dumped on. So I'm not really interested in Kamino or marginfy. I know Jito was a big airdrop.
00:09:29.564 - 00:09:42.860, Speaker A: I missed out on that because I'm a mid curve. I also think JLP. So this is Jupiter. Apy's are pretty ridiculous. It works the same way as GLp. And I was a big GMX guy in 2022. It was like the only asset going up in the bear market.
00:09:42.860 - 00:10:07.962, Speaker A: So I'm sure most of my viewers understand how GLP and GLP works. And if Jupiter, they're going to drop a token on the 31st. So eight days from now. So if they introduce escrow to Jupiter tokenomics or something, I will be aping into this for sure. But I think drift probably is better. It's probably more capital efficient. Just be aware of the risks.
00:10:07.962 - 00:10:16.706, Speaker A: Just read the documentation. Right. Just do it. That's gonna be it for the solenoid section. I like drift. I like JLP. Not a huge fan of the other point systems.
00:10:16.706 - 00:10:46.258, Speaker A: I think tensor is good. I think parcel is interesting, like the real estate perps. But I'm more of a fan of perps on Solana because, I mean, one of their use cases for or one of the narratives for Solana was that let's bring the Nasdaq on chain, right? It's like a. It's like a chain designed for quick trading and, like, you know, cheap transactions and perps. So I would expect drift to be worth something. And, you know, drift obviously is going to be way more capital efficient than, like, GLP. So, I mean.
00:10:46.258 - 00:11:07.004, Speaker A: I mean, it's going to be a good product, but it's going to be more of a farm from my perspective. So it's going to be for me, or at least for the solid section. So there's that. So, going back to, I guess, Celestia, right. I posted this meme, which did some numbers, right. It's like, you know, all my tia is staked, and I'm locked for 21 days. It's over.
00:11:07.004 - 00:11:51.370, Speaker A: It seems like people really like this. It seems like a lot of people thought I was being real, right? Or I was, like, not trolling. This is a troll, obviously, right? I mean, you know, if you stake Celestia anytime in the past month, I mean, you know, all these airdrops happening, and obviously, you know, I tweeted about this, but if, like, you have to sell your airdrops, right? Because if you're staking celestia, I mean, it's very illiquid, right? If you want to sell, you have to wait 21 days, and if things are happening in the market where you want to sell your celestia, chances are prices are going down. And if prices are going down, then if you have to wait 21 days, I mean, at that point, like, maybe prices are going to go down, like, 50% more, right, if we're in that market situation. So just be aware, right? I mean, Celestia, I think it's a good play. Pretty asymmetric risk return. But you don't need to bet on this.
00:11:51.370 - 00:12:17.944, Speaker A: You know, like, for example, like, I'm equally convinced on, I guess, like, Celestia and, like, maker, right? I've talked to my maker a few times, but, like, my maker bag is much bigger because maker is very, very liquid. It's the most liquid altcoin on chain. So, you know, I can just get out in one transaction if I wanted to. Like, in, like, 2 hours if I wanted to, right? Whereas for Celestia, I'm locked up. So just be aware of these risks. There's, like, no, there's no such thing as a free lunch. It's all, like, thesis driven.
00:12:17.944 - 00:12:36.706, Speaker A: It's also like. Like, it's all concept wise or, you know, it's. Yeah, there's, like, nothing proving, like, the celestial thesis that, you know, it's gonna make you a bunch of money or make me a bunch of money. Just be aware. And if you don't sell any of your airdrops, then you're just sitting on air, right. It's all fluff. So I like dimension, but, you know, it's being dumped on right.
00:12:36.706 - 00:13:05.360, Speaker A: Before the Evo market launched, my prediction for dimension was that it's gonna launch at one to $2, and then it'll settle somewhere around five. Maybe that's being priced in ahead of time. I mean, I honestly have no idea. But for dimension, I'm probably not going to sell my airdrop. I'll probably just stake it. And then for other airdrops, like manta or Alt layer, right? So alt layer, they announced their drop. They took a snapshot on January 17, and 10% of the airdrop is going to go.
00:13:05.360 - 00:13:32.234, Speaker A: Is going to go to Celestia stakers. And I don't think they. Yeah. So the claim site for TS stakers is work in progress. They don't have, like, airdrop eligibility criteria yet, but maybe they're going to do a claim page like a week or two weeks or a month after the token goes live. It's kind of annoying how all these teams are pushing off the celestial airdrops and whatnot. But also, how can you complain? There's nothing forcing these teams to airdrop.
00:13:32.234 - 00:13:58.912, Speaker A: In fact, all these airdrops, you can think of them as marketing tools. Alt layer, they raise so much money, restaked roll ups. So maybe this token does well going to Eigen layer launch. But most people didn't really know what this protocol did. And I would expect that most of these followers are fake. They bought these followers. Who knows? Things like this alt layer, I'm going to dump it at some point.
00:13:58.912 - 00:14:39.412, Speaker A: Maybe I'll just hold on to it and then wait until the ETH Maxis starts showing Eigen layer and then I'll just dump on the ETH maxis. Actually, the ETH Maxis are angel investors. Know the angel investors never lose, right? They never lose. But, you know, look out for this. I do. I still think, I still think that manta, I still think that they're eventually gonna give it to TF stakers maybe like a couple months after, I mean, they already dropped the token, right? So I still think that, you know, they can't really go back on their, I guess their claims that, you know, they are gonna like involve the celestia community. So I wouldn't give manta too much hate right now.
00:14:39.412 - 00:15:15.442, Speaker A: You know, if they don't say anything for, let's say it's like middle of February and they don't say anything, then. Yeah, like, you know, I think we should, I mean, right now I'm holding a rake, right. But, you know, this will become a pitchfork at some point, right, if Samantha just keeps ignoring us. So, you know, this is called activist airdrop farming, right? It's like, you know, we have to take matters into our own hands. We can't just, you know, let these teams just get away with it, right, if they keep lying to people. So, you know, activist airdrop farming, you know, you have to join me, right? You have to join me on this journey. Otherwise the VC's will get away with it for free alt layer.
00:15:15.442 - 00:15:34.746, Speaker A: I think it's gonna be a pretty decent airdrop. I think. I know people don't like this thing. It's worth twenty four cents. I mean, $2.4 billion dv like, I have no idea how to value these things, but hey, it probably pumps an eigen later launch, right? So that's kind of going to be my plan. It's not loading, but it's like $0.24.
00:15:34.746 - 00:16:07.024, Speaker A: Also that I mentioned, the claims are no longer live or sorry, the claims ended. All the people that didn't claim their dimension tokens, they're going to be going into the people that did claim. So I think only half the wallets claimed their dym. But if you think about it, right, most of the dym went to Celestia stakers. And I really doubt that anyone that staked Celestia, like, forgot about this. So I think most of the unclaimed wallets are like Solana wallets or like eth wallets. And all those wallets barely got any dym.
00:16:07.024 - 00:16:48.108, Speaker A: So, you know, I think in terms like redistribution, I don't really think we're gonna get that many new tokens. Maybe like 20% to 30% more tokens, which is great, right? I mean, if you got 200 tokens and you get, let's say 50 more, I mean, at the current pricing of dym on Evo, it's like $150, which, you know, like, that's great, right? You can't really complain about free money. I think crypto people, right, people love to complain about free money, but I think, you know, we have to be thankful and we should only be upset if teams lie to us, like manta network. We'll see. And lastly, also Jupiter, sorry, not Jupyter bear chain. So this has been hyped for quite some time now. I'm not really sure how to feel about this.
00:16:48.108 - 00:17:07.056, Speaker A: They raised $42.69 million, right? Or like $42.069 million or something at like a $420 million valuation. And they just dropped testnet. Um, honestly, I'm not going to be doing this. I'm too lazy, to be honest. But if you have the time, then you should do it.
00:17:07.056 - 00:17:59.654, Speaker A: Like, there's like no downside other than, I guess, like, the opportunity cost of your time. One of the reasons I'm not doing this is because it is EVM. And one thing about airdrops is that any airdrop that's on, like, some EVM chain is going to be massively diluted, right? Because all the money, all the capital, um, in crypto or most of the capital in crypto is on Eth mainnet and also l two s, um, and obviously they're all EVM, right? Um, so if there's any airdrop opportunity that is EVM. There's no friction for these eth maxis. And I guess, like, eat people or like irregular people to just bridge to a new chain and like, do all this, there's friction. Right? Of course, when it comes to, let's say, downloading, like the phantom wallet or the Kepler wallet on Solana and Cosmos. And that's why all these airdrops, that's not EVM, is less diluted.
00:17:59.654 - 00:18:51.534, Speaker A: And for that reason, if I had to spend 10 hours airdrop farming something, I think the risk reward of my time is better suited for non EVM chains over EVM chains. It doesn't mean that, you know, for example, like, you know, I would much rather farm bearer chain than, you know, like, what is it? Where's Camino? Right? Camino, for example, because I'm not a huge fan of, like, money market tokens. Just because something's on non EVM doesn't mean that it's going to be worth a lot. You have to think about, okay, like, how much is this thing going to be actually, like, worth? So obviously, l one tokens, l two tokens are going to be worth a lot more than any of these, like, app tokens on average. So I still think it's worth doing. But just something to be aware of. There was like this situation where on scroll, right, the Zkl two or like, whatever, right, general purpose l two L2.
00:18:51.534 - 00:19:29.202, Speaker A: On Ethereum, um, there was like this situation where I could have like, deployed a smart contract on scroll to receive some developer, NFT. And I'm like, yeah, like, let me just mint that Nft. Um, and then I did that, right on like a single wallet. And then a week later, scroll put out this announcement. It's like, oh, yeah, like 3 million developers minted, uh, this Nft on Skrull. Um, and obviously there's like, no, there's no way that 3 million, like, people, right, deployed a contract. It's more likely that like, maybe like a couple thousand people each, like all these, like, airdrop farming operations, like, just mint this NfT because they have some bots.
00:19:29.202 - 00:20:06.600, Speaker A: And all these bots, like, these bots are made for EVM, but not for non EVM. I would expect later in the year there would be a bunch of bots in non EVM land. So, you know, I mean, you know, there's such a thing as alpha decay, right? Like, if there's a bunch of money to be made in, like, like doing something, then at some point the market will figure it out and it's going to be diluted. There's no such thing as a free lunch, so just something to be worried about or just something to be aware of. But I think bear train, I mean, if you have time, definitely do this. I have Tia and Adam staked, so hopefully they'll give me some tokens. I mean, I'm not really counting on it, to be honest.
00:20:06.600 - 00:20:42.424, Speaker A: They already have nfts. I'm pretty sure that they're going to reward testnet users and NFT holders, overdose, passive holders, like me. But, hey, you know, who cares? I mean, you know, like, my expectation for, I guess, holding Celestia was that, where's that meme? I love this. Oh, yeah. My expectation for Celestia is that, you know, like, maybe in 2024, maybe once a month, I'll get, like, a pretty decent airdrop. And when I say decent, I'm not saying like, you know, $10,000, right? Maybe like $500, $300. I mean, that's a decent airdrop if you think about it.
00:20:42.424 - 00:21:06.620, Speaker A: And if every single month there is on average, like a $300 airdrop, then that's pretty good. But that doesn't mean that there's going to be an airdrop every single week or every single month. Maybe in January, there's three really good airdrops, and then in February there's no airdrops. But that doesn't mean that that was a bad play. I have no inside information. I have no idea who's going to be sticking. So who's going to be airdropping the Tsiggers.
00:21:06.620 - 00:21:41.090, Speaker A: But it makes sense from a developer perspective because it's free marketing. Think about how many people are talking about alt layer because of this airdrop. Thousands of people didn't even hear about this token, and now they're like, wow, you restaked roll ups. That's cool. It's mostly a marketing tool for these projects. Also, if you're building on cosmos, it's the ethos to airdrop, to the community. There's also some social layer to these airdrops that I think people are also overlooking, especially if you're like an eat maxi.
00:21:41.090 - 00:21:53.390, Speaker A: That's gonna be it for me, I think. I don't know if there's anything I want to talk about. Talk about mid curving. I'm a mid curve. That's fine. I love this meme. It's so good.
00:21:53.390 - 00:22:11.184, Speaker A: Especially because people think I was being serious. That's the best meme when you're being sarcastic. But people don't know that you're being sarcastic. Yeah, I mean, you know, like points, right? If you're a dev, it makes sense to do points. But don't let the devs farm you. Right? Just do not let the devs farm you. Right.
00:22:11.184 - 00:22:37.784, Speaker A: This is an example of hyper liquid dropping points and then the devs farming all of, all the traders. I mean, if you're an LP, you're printing money, right? Because all these people that think they can like ten x long or ten x short, they're just getting absolutely destroyed. But hey, you know, like transfer wealth, I suppose. Efficient markets. I suppose so. Thank you guys for watching. See you guys next week.
00:22:37.784 - 00:22:45.408, Speaker A: And if you like the content, please check out the premium discord. Prices will go up at the beginning of next month. Thanks for watching and have fun from it out there. Bye.
