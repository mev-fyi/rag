00:00:00.520 - 00:00:30.624, Speaker A: How. How both you got. And I'll share, of course, share mine as well. But how compound Enuma came to be and how things have just changed so much since the early inceptions, because, you know, there is a. There is this kind of changing environment of DeFi, but, you know, compound in particular, and Uma, shortly after, you guys were pretty much trailblazing what it is, you know, what DeFi is today. So would love to hear your stories about the inception.
00:00:30.792 - 00:00:34.540, Speaker B: Yeah. Robert, you existed before DeFi was a word, right?
00:00:34.880 - 00:01:24.836, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. So I guess I'll go first. I mean, so it was 2017. It was the middle of the sort of ICO boom, and I sort of looked around at the space, and everybody was using smart contracts to create tokens and to come up with, like, token sale contracts, and nobody was using smart contracts to build really interesting financial applications and markets. Literally, at that time, the only cool smart contracts that existed were zero x non custodial trades. And aside from that, there was basically nothing. And looking at the space, I was shocked because smart contracts are crazy powerful, and nobody's really exploring what you could build with them in terms of creating really interesting financial markets.
00:01:24.836 - 00:02:22.890, Speaker C: And so I basically decided that and there that I was going to build something with smart contracts that you couldn't build without them. And looking at the space, the most obvious thing was like, oh, why don't we use smart contracts to create interest rates? And why was that necessary? Well, because crypto is irreversible and it settles permanently. It's really hard to send someone crypto and hope to get it back. Right, whereas you can send someone money and it's very easy to get it back. Sending someone crypto, there's no way you're getting it back unless there's a smart contract or you really know each other. And so it seemed like a really ideal application that you couldn't really build through centralized services very well due to the trust factor. And so this was before DeFi was a phrase, and we basically got to work saying, well, let's build a completely autonomous market for people to earn an interest rate and borrow assets.
00:02:22.890 - 00:03:19.066, Speaker C: And it was a lot harder than it seemed because there was very few functional systems running in 2017. It took months of just pure R and D to even discover what was possible using smart contracts before we proved that something like compound was possible. We released a prototype in early 2018 and then shipped the first version later in 2018 and late summer. That was right around the same time. Exactly that the phrase Defi was sort of created wasn't created by us by any stretch. But that was like the sort of, like, beginning of sort of decentralized finance, you know, fully autonomous markets. You know, Makerdao was sort of, you know, our predecessor in a few ways, like they, you know, Psy, which used to be called Dai, but Psy was sort of, you know, early 2018 as well.
00:03:19.066 - 00:03:24.010, Speaker C: And Defi back then was like, you know, five projects. It was kind of a crazy time.
00:03:25.030 - 00:03:34.942, Speaker B: And, Robert, you're like a finance nerd, too, right? You've always been a finance nerd. Or did you. Did you come to be a finance nerd doing more of this DeFi stuff?
00:03:35.126 - 00:03:44.662, Speaker C: No, I was a finance nerd before Defi, and so I really wanted to do finance on a blockchain. I was one of, like, the five people that thought that that was cool. Well, Rob.
00:03:44.686 - 00:03:52.582, Speaker A: Well, what was, what was happening? What were you doing before 2007? What was like 20, 1514? What did that look like for you?
00:03:52.766 - 00:04:28.390, Speaker C: Yeah. So from 2007 to 2011, which was kind of like a dark age on Wall Street, I was working in interest rates, both in the sort of, like, analysis and modeling side. And after that, I sort of left finance and became a software founder, moved out to California, did this Silicon Valley startup World and Ethereum and smart contracts brought those two things together where I was like, oh, wow, you can program money. That's incredibly powerful. What can we build now that we can program money?
00:04:31.370 - 00:04:32.026, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:04:32.058 - 00:04:50.320, Speaker B: Yeah, finance nerd. Finance nerd. But, yeah. And Robert, I was trading interest rates from 2005 to 2013, which, you know, so co finance nerds. Chris, you were never a finance nerd, though. You've always been, like, a cool e commerce guy, right?
00:04:50.900 - 00:05:27.082, Speaker A: Prior to that, I was a bodybuilder. Interesting enough. But yeah, no, yeah, I was never a finance guy. I actually spent most of my early career in tech sales, hardware, software, like big Cisco and Microsoft, vmware type stuff. And I was doing that in New York, and then that was where I actually found bitcoin, because my office was right on top of the original Bitcoin center on Wall street. So I kind of got lucky, and I had a buddy of mine that moved to New York as well from Toronto, and he was just like, dude, you got to come down here. You got to buy some bitcoin.
00:05:27.082 - 00:05:56.010, Speaker A: Used to buy bitcoin off of a guy that was managing an auction with an Excel spreadsheet as the order book, wearing a bowtie. Like, it was pretty, pretty funny stuff, but, yeah, like, most. Most of my time was spent in sales, and then I got into e commerce and online marketing with a couple businesses that I started in 2015 through. Yeah, like 14 through 16. And then I just pretty much spent the rest of my time in crypto.
00:05:56.990 - 00:06:04.770, Speaker B: Wait, Rob, what year? Or. Chris, what year was this about the Bitcoin center on Wall street? Is this like 13?
00:06:04.930 - 00:06:06.390, Speaker A: Yeah, 1314.
00:06:07.170 - 00:06:08.670, Speaker B: That's fucking wild, man.
00:06:09.370 - 00:06:10.510, Speaker C: Yeah. You're OG.
00:06:11.050 - 00:06:11.830, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:13.690 - 00:06:38.196, Speaker A: I guess I just, you know, bought and hold bitcoin. I don't know how old you that is, but I still have the bitcoin that I bought then. Interesting enough, which is. Which is great, but yet it's, you know, it's just the journey, I think, for a lot of folks is different, you know, for me. And that's what kind of led to badger. But it was like, I've always been a believer. And, Rob, I think you mean you had a little bit of a debate with Brad on one of our poker games.
00:06:38.196 - 00:07:07.002, Speaker A: Hart, you might have been there too, a few months ago, but it was like, I've always believed bitcoin to be the premier collateral, right. The best part of money ever invented. And that has nothing to do with the permissionless platforms like Ethereum, but a lot of people are always doing this. Bitcoin versus ethereum. Bitcoin versus ethereum. This tribalism is just so ridiculous, right. And that's, you know, I was never on that side.
00:07:07.002 - 00:07:30.710, Speaker A: I've always been a big fan of eth. I've always been a big fan of bitcoin because they're independently amazing in their own rights. And just to see, I actually argue nowadays it's actually not as toxic as it was maybe a couple years ago amongst the communities. But, you know, that. That in itself has changed quite a bit over the years. But I'm happy to see it, at least now.
00:07:32.800 - 00:08:29.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it still feels a little bit adversarial just because I think. I think it sort of stems from bitcoin in that it is an asset that is created through social consensus and it has value because people believe it has value, and it's useful because people believe that it's valuable. And so it makes sense to try to convince everyone that it's the only important asset so that all capital flows into bitcoin so that its chance of success is highest. Right. Because it needs that social consensus. And I think the reason why bitcoiners are antagonistic to things that arent bitcoin, they also have good reason to be, probably dating from the 2013 to 2016 era, where everything that wasnt bitcoin really was just a tacky attempt before there was anything useful. That's not bitcoin in a lot of ways.
00:08:29.900 - 00:08:41.720, Speaker C: And so I can see the history there and why they're so skeptical of things that aren't bitcoin, even when super useful stuff like ethereum has proven that there's more than just bitcoin.
00:08:42.300 - 00:09:03.836, Speaker B: Yeah, but, Rob, we're also in this age of tribalism, right. So it does kind of make sense, like you said. But, Chris, you found a way to bridge the gap, right? Like Badger does seem to be. Give me the latest on what bitcoiners think of what badger is doing. They're like mostly pro it these days. Right?
00:09:03.988 - 00:09:15.400, Speaker A: No, no, no, sorry. If you. If you talk to, like, hardcore bitcoiners about badger, like, they. They're just like, oh, it's eth. It's centralized shit. Like, that's just how they talk. Right.
00:09:15.400 - 00:09:42.430, Speaker A: This is ridiculous. So, no, that's by no means our target audience today, or at least the users of badger today. That's where we hope to get through over time. But for the most part, the people that use our protocol are heavy defi power users that want exposure to bitcoin and also want to put that bitcoin to work and don't want to just leaving in a hardware wallet doing nothing, you know?
00:09:43.170 - 00:10:08.018, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think there's something to be said about the power of yield here. Right. Like the idea to have. I think the people in Badger, they're people that have bitcoin and are seeing all their defi friends put assets to work and actually earn more. I mean, that's pretty attractive. Right. And that's been a good amount of your users who want to do something productive with their bitcoin.
00:10:08.018 - 00:10:08.830, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:09.850 - 00:10:34.874, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. Right. That's, you know, that. That's the whole thing. And I believe over time, more and more, I believe, you know, I don't know what the timeframe is, but upwards of 50% of all bitcoin will live maybe fifty cents a bit much. But like 40% of all bitcoin will live on other chains and be used on other chains and made productive. And I don't necessarily see much of that productivity coming on the bitcoin network.
00:10:34.874 - 00:10:48.860, Speaker A: And that's not a bad thing. Right? Like, the interoperability and the composability cross chain is going to be very valuable and make bitcoin even more valuable because it brings additional utility. It's going to take, you know, it's going to take time to get there, but I believe it's going to get there.
00:10:49.760 - 00:10:55.380, Speaker C: Yeah. If you can make it not a pet rock and you can make it something useful, you know, it's better for everybody.
00:10:55.920 - 00:11:08.310, Speaker A: Yeah, most certainly. Well, Hart, like, what? Hart, what's been your story? I don't know as much about your story as I'd like to, but I'd like to learn more about it. Even pre, like, crypto.
00:11:08.930 - 00:11:59.068, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm canadian, like you, man. I went to high school in Toronto, I went to college in the states, and I graduated and worked on Wall street for eight years trading interest rates. So doing the finance nerd thing like Robert, but I traded interest rates at Goldman Sachs and was like, it was a weird job, man. It was really, really interesting. And I learned a ton of stuff that I didn't know because I didn't come from that background. I was like a computer science nerd in college, and that gave me lots of finance exposure, all kinds of shit that I like. I was literally the guy at Goldman selling bonds to the Fed when they were buying them through the financial crisis.
00:11:59.068 - 00:12:48.880, Speaker B: That was kind of fun. And then I did this fintech startup following that, and in early 2018, late 2017, I got pulled back into crypto and kind of like what Robert said. I look at, I think, ethereum's primary use case is finance. And that was sort of my thesis from early on that it just smart contracts plus money building an automated, programmable way of moving financial risk and moving money through smart contracts made all the sense in the world. And I was like, nobody's building derivatives or building ways to program financial contracts on Ethereum. And that's what drew me in the space back then.
00:12:51.700 - 00:12:53.840, Speaker A: And then how did Uma come to be?
00:12:55.150 - 00:13:35.466, Speaker B: So the original idea, I think, is just being kind of nerdy here. A derivative contract, like a traditional derivative contract, is this financial contract between two counterparties, and it's secured with margin. That's like cash money. You move around, but in the traditional banking system, it takes you, like, at least a day to move that money around. And it's really clunky. It works pretty well, but it only works pretty well at massive size. And I was really attracted to this idea of using smart contracts to create derivatives with continuous real time margining.
00:13:35.466 - 00:14:25.560, Speaker B: So I'm being like, super nerdy here. But the idea is, if you could move money really quickly, you could secure a derivative contract with a small amount of margin, because you keep moving those margin payments really quickly. And in theory, something like a blockchain like Ethereum could be a really beautiful way to do that. And this would let anybody write derivative contracts without, like, without legal recourse? And this would be a really powerful, wild way to effectively create a protocol for risk, like move financial risk across the world to anyone that had access to the Internet and digital money. And that seems like a pretty good thing to try to build and seem pretty fun. So that's kind of like the origin story, if you will.
00:14:26.780 - 00:14:59.924, Speaker A: And did you guys raise. Did you guys raise money? This is an interesting conversation for me because some people know, but Badger launched a few months ago without raising a dollar. And, you know, we're completely. We're completely intended to be a community run project and initiative, you know, a headless type organization, as Andre will call it. But it's very different from how some of the. And they call them younger defi projects, meaning like a year prior, but, you know, some of the projects came to be. So for you guys, did you.
00:14:59.924 - 00:15:04.000, Speaker A: Did you go down more of a traditional route? And how was that experience?
00:15:05.060 - 00:15:42.900, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'll start. So when we were creating compound, we had no idea if there was ever going to be demand for what we now call Defi. You have to appreciate that this was 2017, 2018, and we were building completely untested systems. Defi really did not exist yet. When I was asked what the market size was, I said, today it's basically $0, but eventually it's trillions of dollars. And I had one, no idea how long it would take before there would be market demand. In some cases, I thought it might be like five years and two.
00:15:42.900 - 00:16:38.016, Speaker C: Most of the sort of development activity and speed that happens now when people are launching products occurs because there's already lots of templates out there. There's lots of projects that have figured out a lot of very basic building blocks for creating smart contracts and creating autonomous products. But back in this day, there was really no libraries or existing contracts that you could copy, that you could copy paste from, that you could learn from. So everything we were doing, we had to basically discover for the first time for the industry. And so for us, it was a no brainer that we had to raise. There was literally no way we could have shipped compound in 2018 and had won a market, two users and three a means of survival. And so we raised venture capital money.
00:16:38.016 - 00:17:18.098, Speaker C: Our seed round was like $8 million or so. And it's because we thought it might take years to be able to ship compound. And for us, we wanted the plan to have more capital than we needed, mostly because everything we were doing was completely unproven. It was possible that we'd be sitting around building for years. And so that was sort of how we financed the business, put a team together, and sort of underwrote the initial development. And that was, I think, completely necessary at the time. It's less necessary in 2021 because a lot of the heavy lifting has been done at this point.
00:17:18.098 - 00:17:56.924, Speaker C: I don't want to say it's easy to deploy a protocol, but you're not solving problems for the first time. You're kind of dragging and dropping a lot of ideas that other people have created, for the most part, in new and exciting ways. So it's not like six months of R and D to build something. People are launching products with two weeks of engineering. It's crazy. And so I think teams nowadays don't need to have five engineers working for a year to be able to ship something. A lot of teams now have, like, two people, and they ship something in a couple of weeks, and there's a lot smaller hurdle to going live, and so there's less need for capital.
00:17:56.924 - 00:18:04.320, Speaker C: But back in 2018, I mean, it was, it was capital or death, you know? And so we went the round of raising money.
00:18:05.180 - 00:18:18.596, Speaker A: What were the. Was it hard to raise money, Rob, then? Because that was a weird time. Like, when was that, like, late 2018 or right before? You know, the. The Ico craze destroyed the market.
00:18:18.788 - 00:19:10.018, Speaker C: Yeah, it was like March 2018, and it was a really funny time because bitcoin hit its highs a couple of months earlier. Ether hit its highs a little before that, but was starting to crash. I mean, it was a time where crypto was cooling off and icos were over, just flat out over. You'd get ridiculed a little bit if in March you were pitching an ICO. And so it was like the beginnings of crypto winter, and that was sort of like, what set off a pretty long period of building. But March 2018 was still, like, a pretty good time to raise because there was still a lot of enthusiasm. The highs were only a couple months ago, and a lot of days we thought, like, we made it through the door before it closed, and after that, it got a lot harder.
00:19:10.018 - 00:19:20.380, Speaker C: $8 million seed rounds. You know, we were kind of one of the last ones of that sort of generation. And after that, it got pretty hard for teams to put together capital to be able to build.
00:19:20.960 - 00:19:46.090, Speaker A: Yeah, you right in that window. Like, it was that march. It was like March to consensus. I remember I was at consensus that year, and, like, the market peaked back up from, like, a big dip to, like, four or 500 million or something, a billion or something. And I remember people on fire again with like raising and some ICO stuff right around consensus. But after, like, it was that three month window and then it was just a death spiral.
00:19:46.390 - 00:20:00.370, Speaker C: Yeah. Then it was winter. It was like a true, like, you had very little. Most teams had very little capital and resources and they had to build with nothing. And that was, that was hard and we felt extremely lucky and that we made the right choice.
00:20:02.390 - 00:20:31.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree with you, Rob. I think, you know, it's, and I'll speak from, you know, just our level of experience. It's, it's. It's one thing to point, like, one thing I don't like that I see some groups do kind of like, they point and say, like, vc investment, that type of stuff's bad. That's stupid. It's like, that's actually like their marketing pitch, something along those lines, as if, like, you know, that's, that's a bad thing. Like, it's not.
00:20:31.420 - 00:21:16.564, Speaker A: There's different ways to do things, but, like, the way that protocols can trailblaze and bootstrap, really, it's a bootstrapping activity. Leveraging things like liquidity mining and things along those lines to take products to market, to take their business to market, is very unique and is not possible without the underlying templates that you speak of. If it's synthetic, how many, how many governance. How many governance modules are built off of compound or staking contracts are built off of synthetics. Right. Like, that's kind of part of so much of what exists today. And I think people that look at it negatively are really short sighted.
00:21:16.564 - 00:21:51.560, Speaker A: And it's more around the lines of the opportunities for bootstrapping have changed tremendously now. And actually, and I believe it's just going to change the whole way businesses go to market, you know, forever now, like, this is this, this in itself, and many people don't talk about this, but, like, this is a whole new playbook for taking businesses to market and accelerating at growth that, you know, you could never imagine. And we're going to continue to see a lot of this, but it definitely was a different time. And people that don't tend to respect the differences, I feel are short sighted.
00:21:51.870 - 00:21:52.982, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean.
00:21:53.126 - 00:23:26.180, Speaker B: Well, I'd add one other thing, Chris, which is like, when Rob was raising money and we raised money after him, tokens were actually evil. Like, they were literally evil. People, like, yelled at you if you had a token or contemplated the token back then, and like, Robert, you raised money without saying you're going to have any token if I remember, and like Dydx and like Dharma kind of were in that era, I think, um, it's actually one of the things, we raised money, $4 million seed round in June, um, of that year. But we actually did the thing where we said we were going to have a token. We said like, we think the point of crypto is these tokens can align, incentives can do powerful things. And again, going back to your point, like the market changed, um, now you can use a token to bootstrap your product and to actually, like, it's a really creative and interesting fundraising mechanism, but in 2018, it was like evil and you couldn't do that following the ICO boom. And one of the things, if you want like a prediction, I don't like this, but I could see if we cycle too high in this, this run right now, I could see us like maybe it's like 2022 that people are anti token again, if bad things happen through this cycle, might be interesting to see.
00:23:26.600 - 00:24:09.600, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, well, going back to the purpose of venture capital, I mean, venture capital is really good at one thing, and that's underwriting risk for long periods of time, right. There's very few other market participants that are willing to provide capital for teams to figure things out over years, not weeks or months. And that is the one thing they do extremely well. And when done correctly, it gives teams the opportunity to figure out things over market cycles, not to have to figure things out immediately, to wait and see how the world unfolds. And I think that's really valuable.
00:24:10.730 - 00:24:36.430, Speaker B: Robert, to your credit, youve been very consistent around that view. I actually remember taking a call with you because I was introduced. We had a common seed investor. I remember being introduced to you by this investor. I remember being in my dads backyard and you telling me exactly this. Youre like, im taking more money than I need because I dont know what the cycle is going to be. And its scary.
00:24:36.430 - 00:24:39.930, Speaker B: You were actually very consistent on this, to your credit.
00:24:40.090 - 00:25:28.486, Speaker C: Yeah, and I actually got that advice way back in the day from Brian at Coinbase, who said, yeah, we raise to get through the next market cycle and we raise enough capital that knowing that there's going to be massive bear markets, time to figure things out and to solve whatever problems occur along the way. And I think in crypto that's super valuable. Having a little bit more money than you think you need, knowing that things might take a lot longer. And sometimes you get lucky things happen sooner than you anticipated. But we had what I was thinking was going to be four years of Runway knowing that there wasn't even a phrase called Defi. It might take four years before people would want to use smart contracts to do finance stuff. It just so happened that it started to pick up relatively quickly.
00:25:28.486 - 00:26:02.316, Speaker C: And by 2019, just a year later, people were using these things in increasing scales. And it was a market that was growing roughly 30 x a year at compound, which are crazy numbers. The first year we had ten, $15 million of assets in the protocol. By the next year, we had 50. By the next year, we were in the hundreds. And right now it's at 9 billion. It grew much faster than anyone would have imagined, like even plausibly.
00:26:02.316 - 00:26:17.000, Speaker C: And maybe we could have gotten by with way less capital. Right. But I think sometimes you're better off just partnering with folks that are thinking in years, not months.
00:26:20.940 - 00:27:46.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I, you know, one of the things that's interesting to me and Rob, we talked about this a while ago, just really loosely, but one of the things I've always thought about it was it speaks to the difference in capital in the system and how nowadays capital accelerates so quickly. You're building off of more battle tested co base. But, like, as we see many, many times, again, one small change could break the castle. Right. So, and it's, and it's code that, you know, for the most part, the people that are building on top are not nearly as familiar as the creators. But, you know, when you talk about going from 15 to 50 to 200 to 9 billion, there's obviously a difference in how kind of you manage the security posture, the protocol and all these types of things when you're not seeing, you know, 100 or 500 or, you know, thousand x growth in capital within days, if not weeks. Like, how do you, how do you both look at that? Because I know it was kind of a slower, a slower move for both of you guys, but how do you see that versus some of the explosion that you've also experienced in the, in the recent times, but as it contrasts to newer protocols that are getting ready to launch or that have launched and that have seen that growth and had to, you know, build the a security posture extremely quickly?
00:27:47.520 - 00:28:34.610, Speaker C: Well, when we started, by the way, like, no one even was convinced that smart contracts were safe enough to use. If you think about the history here, I got sort of my eyes open towards Ethereum and building things with smart contracts when the DAO was hacked and Ethereum forked into Ethereum and Ethereum classic. That was a really bright memory in my mind. After that, the parity multisig wallet, which was like the equivalent of today's gnosis multisig. I mean, it was like the multisig wallet that everybody used had two hacks, both of which led to hundreds of millions of dollars of losses. And that was sort of the backdrop for when we were starting compound. Almost everyone I talked to at the very outset wasn't convinced that smart contracts were safe.
00:28:34.610 - 00:28:57.166, Speaker C: I used to pitch compound. I used to say, well, if they're built correctly, a smart contract can be safer than a centralized business. And a lot of people laughed and didn't take that seriously. They said, no, that's not true. These things are constantly, like, having disasters. You can't rely on them. And it was the mindset that this was unsafe until proven otherwise, and that was our mindset, too.
00:28:57.166 - 00:29:45.870, Speaker C: And so we spent close to a year before we launched. By the time we launched, we had multiple audits. We took everything with an extreme skepticism because we didn't believe that it could be done safely, because no one else believed it could be done safely. In a lot of ways, security and decentralization are opposite ends of the spectrum. The safest thing early on is for a team to have complete control over the code base, in my mind, to be able to react to bugs and crises and unknown situations. And because you have to assume that things don't work, teams today have the ability to take a lot of this stuff for granted. Other teams have proven that smart contracts can be safe, they can work, they can be reliable.
00:29:45.870 - 00:30:21.748, Speaker C: Obviously, people's standards have lowered over time, and I think there's a lot of reasons for that. But at this point, now, people understand that it is possible for this to be done safely without a smart contract bug. And it's a complete evolution of the mindset. And I think teams today are better off, but they don't always show that. They take it for granted sometimes. And you see this, like, again and again, where there's just like waves of projects and every single one of them, quote, gets hacked and loses money. And it's considered to be okay because everyone goes into that with their eyes open.
00:30:21.748 - 00:30:36.898, Speaker C: Everyone's moving fast and having fun and yada, yada, yada. I don't think that's necessarily a great approach, but at least nowadays, teams are pretty transparent. If they test and prod and that there's going to be spectacular failures, it.
00:30:36.914 - 00:31:18.924, Speaker B: Just seems, Rob, like, there's just multiple approaches. Now, your approach was, I think, the go to de facto approach of your era, right, where you're going to raise a bunch of money from Andreessen Horowitz and you've got all this other stuff, like you can't move fast and break shit and lose a bunch of people's money. It's not really acceptable, you know, but other teams feel differently and, like, they don't. It's just kind of a different beast. So it seems, Chris, like there's just more than one way to do this. Right now there are teams out there that are totally comfortable running an experiment knowing that it might not work. And there is something really cool about that.
00:31:18.924 - 00:31:27.440, Speaker B: To be able to run economic experiments and see what happens. It's just also scary and at worst verges on irresponsible. Right?
00:31:29.300 - 00:32:36.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, you know, to Rob's point, I don't know if they had a choice, right? Like, if you're that confident that the smart contracts you're building are going to work because no one's ever done it before and like, you know, it doesn't sound, it doesn't sound like anyone had a confidence that you'd be able to do it. And it takes a year that's much different from everybody, obviously, assuming these things are going to work because it has worked and it's worked to the tune of billions of dollars for a few years or a year and a bit plus. So I do think it's a very different time. I think a lot of it, not uncommon from business and entrepreneurship in general, but a lot of it comes down to the character, integrity, and the value and belief system of the people behind the business too. Right? Like when you talk about these grand experiments that people are doing, a lot of the times, you know, for whatever reasons, this is not a knock, but, you know, people hide behind anonymity. And many of the times it feels like, and I'm not speaking about any group in particular, but it feels like it's. It's kind of a quick thing to make a quick buck, you know? You know, let's call a spade a spade.
00:32:36.960 - 00:32:59.900, Speaker A: How much bullshit rug pulls are there all the time from people that like, you know, promise a bunch of stuff and then just steal a bunch of money from people, right? Like those are the somewhat think about someone that would do that, right? Like, as an individual and the character and morale of that individual and how off that is from, like, you know, what we're all out there to try and do and build and have a real impact on the space around.
00:33:00.850 - 00:33:11.350, Speaker B: Greed is a powerful force, man. You know, but I agree with you, Chris. It's not the way, you know, I think your mom would be proud. It's not the way she raised you, and it's not the way you're gonna act.
00:33:13.210 - 00:33:15.430, Speaker A: But my mom here.
00:33:17.330 - 00:33:18.322, Speaker C: Don'T bring her into this.
00:33:18.346 - 00:33:20.706, Speaker A: Art, don't bring my mother into this.
00:33:20.818 - 00:33:36.140, Speaker B: Your mom's a saint, man. I'm sure she's a lovely, lovely lady. We're all good. Yeah, but no, man, I mean, your mom should be proud. Like, she's got a nice, you know, she's got a son that's like, doing crazy shit in Defi and in crypto.
00:33:36.300 - 00:33:51.124, Speaker A: And I say that to her, defi, she'd be like, what the fuck is that? Mom's, like, first generation canadian from Italy. Like, she's fucking defi. Oh, my goodness. That's funny, man. That's funny. But, yeah, times are different. It's just.
00:33:51.124 - 00:34:10.750, Speaker A: It is what it is as it relates to, you know, what it was like to build then. Like, even for us. We just launched three months ago. I can't even believe that. It feels like it's been fucking a decade. Just the trenches that we've been through. And we built our co base primarily off of yearn v one vaults.
00:34:10.750 - 00:35:18.382, Speaker A: That was where our product co base, we built some optimizations around it, and we built our own reward and staking mechanism, which was a massive lift for us. But we also spent the time prior to launch through peer review, through audits, and we did all that type of stuff for the purpose of, like, we're not going to put. Even if this has been battle tested and it's been audited a bunch of times, and there's already been hundreds of millions of dollars in a protocol like this, we can't just go to market. It's just not the way to do it. We have to make sure that all the pieces kind of work together and also give us time to get as familiar as humanly possible with the code base that we're bringing forward in the system. And that, you know, we finished building, I think it was August range, and we didn't launch till December. And it was kind of just going through a lot of that process and timing ended up working out just because there was a little bit of the Defi summer burnout and then getting ready for the Christmas time in general.
00:35:18.382 - 00:36:25.470, Speaker A: Like, that's, you know, I talked to quite a few folks that, you know, have either recently launched or are about to launch. And it's like, you know, do everything, call it what it is, call what you're building what it is, and do everything you can to protect the most likely inevitable huge influx of capital that's going to come into your system. Like just recognize that immediately that is probably going to happen and know that it's going to throw you for a massive loop and it's going to be unbelievably stressful and difficult to manage. But at the same time, your number one responsibility is protecting those users funds and the integrity of the system. So what can you do to help do that? There's a lot of things because the space is matured, even certain coverage, protection or whatever you want to call them, insurance protocols like incentivize the shit out of that. So in case something does happen, make sure that their asses are covered. Make sure you use whatever incentives you can provide to drive people to go get that protection.
00:36:25.470 - 00:37:19.122, Speaker A: And Rob, to your point earlier, and we got a lot of shit for this at Baxter, but we kept as much control as we could for the purpose of agility around the contracts that we put into the market. People were saying, hey, throw a time lock on that. Hey, you know, you need to do all these different things. You should have, you know, a seven of nine and all the signers should be public. And, you know, people just kept going on and on around, you know, the governance and the management and upgradability of the contracts. But you know, like you said, and I'll agree with it and, you know, I'll echo it when protocols are launching. We feel, I feel like the best way to protect users funds and protect the potential disaster situation is to have as much control as you can with the intention and plan towards slowly decentralizing.
00:37:19.122 - 00:37:32.960, Speaker A: And that I hope more and more people think that way. And also, like I said, incentivize that protection and coverage day one for their users, if that's something that they can do.
00:37:33.660 - 00:37:57.970, Speaker B: Chris, that works. But it goes back to your earlier point, as long as the team you're trusting here at launch is credible. And it's interesting because I think that really doesn't work. If that team is anonymous or unknown, you actually need to go the other route where you can't give them that same trust you would to a credible known team. Do you agree with that or no?
00:37:58.350 - 00:38:08.494, Speaker A: Well, I don't know that. That's a hard one, right? Because like, you know, look, well, I was gonna say look at sushi, but, but look what happened with sushi too, right?
00:38:08.542 - 00:38:10.846, Speaker B: Like in those first, they're both examples, right?
00:38:10.958 - 00:38:57.000, Speaker A: You know, it's kind of both, right? Like there's certain people with certain, you know, certain belief systems that were, that were starting if it was sushi stuff at the time, and then you obviously have Mackie, but you know, it was the anonymity that gave the confidence for sushi Sef to take the funds or not take the funds, but cash out. And if they weren't anonymous, would that probably have not happened? I don't know. Right. But I would say more times than not hart the anonymous groups would be less trustworthy than the anonymous, than the non anonymous groups, I would say, yeah, I don't know. What do you think, Rob?
00:38:57.540 - 00:40:18.256, Speaker C: Well, I think at the beginning, before you've decentralized something and it runs completely autonomously, or through an extremely large distributed group where you can't get rugged, so to speak, in the early days, I think a lot of projects do work best if when you're using code that's never flown before and things can go wrong in a moment's notice, having the ability to pull the emergency cord, and it does rely on the reputation of the developers that they have, that they're not going to do anything malicious. Now, I don't think many people should trust a system with a large amount of funds or a large amount of their own funds before protections are in place. And I think any system shouldn't scale prematurely, but I do think reputation is a strong deterrent, and reputation includes the people involved, the people supporting them, etcetera. When everyone knows the identity of somebody, it's a lot less likely in my mind that they're going to deliberately rug somebody. Most of the situations we see are with anonymous founders. The worst possible combination is anonymous founders or team, and no restrictions on their ability to act. That's a terrible combination.
00:40:18.256 - 00:40:44.890, Speaker C: But I think a known team in low restrictions early on with low amounts of capital is fine, especially if people understand how it works. And I think you scale and you grow from there. And as the amount of assets in a system increases and the Lindy effect takes hold, and that code has been running safely, that's absolutely when and why and how you start to remove privileged access.
00:40:46.190 - 00:41:17.644, Speaker A: And I know there's no answer to this, but what timeframe would you put around that? Like, when do you start considering a set of contracts to be not ready for, obviously complete decentralization, but to have had a enough really smart eyes, enough attempts, and kind of a level of seasonality to them in the market? Is that three months? Is that six months? Is that a year? Is that a month? Like, where do you, where do you guys stand on that side of the fence?
00:41:17.812 - 00:41:39.740, Speaker B: I think we should put a rule of thumb around this, Chris, I think we can do that, right? I don't know if you can measure it, but I feel like three months with like $100 million in something is like. I feel like that's a pretty good sanity check that this surface area, the attack area is clear. Robert, what do you think?
00:41:40.360 - 00:42:18.536, Speaker C: Well, I think that's pretty good. I think the reason why it's good is because it has to be sitting out there long enough for black hats to be motivated to act. Something could be on mainnet for two years with $100,000 and it's not going to catch anybody's attention. You're not going to have people attempting to break into it. But I actually think the standards go up. When there was five Defi applications, compound being one of five, there was only five places to look. If you were a black hat, you'd spend a week on compound, a week on DYDX, a week on Dharma, whatever, a week on maker.
00:42:18.536 - 00:43:00.690, Speaker C: Now, everyone did. I know a lot of people that tried to break those respective systems, and you are more likely to catch the attention of white hat, gray hat and black hat folks. Now, there's just so many projects that the likelihood of being noticed is lower in a lot of ways. And so I do think it's a function of time spent with a large amount of assets. But I think the standards have gone up. Two years ago, I would have said, oh, having more than a million dollars in it, you know, in a couple months, you know, that's the test of time. You know, I'm not going to poke fun at a particular team, but there was a particular team that got hacked like, three times.
00:43:00.690 - 00:43:27.540, Speaker C: Right. And it happened like a week after their assets went from like 1 million to, like, 15 million. As soon as they started growing, that's when, you know, it clearly pulled black hats, you know, out of the woodwork to, like, take a look. Right. And immediately after they started growing is when, like, problems started happening. You know, they were on Mainnet for a long time prior to that. Right.
00:43:27.540 - 00:43:58.948, Speaker C: With no issues, even though the same issues and bugs and all that would have probably been there. So, you know, it is a function of the market dynamics. I do think there's a limited number of, you know, malicious actors in the space, and I think their attention is limited. I think it includes individuals and nation states. I mean, I'm pretty sure some of the more corrupt and evil nation states actually do play in that arena. North Korea in particular. But as a rule of thumb, yeah, sure.
00:43:58.948 - 00:44:16.970, Speaker C: $100 million in three months, you're probably fine. Assuming that there's no additional changes to the code base, and every additional change to the code base either needs to be small and well understood or be audited thoroughly. If that code base is changing, you have to reset the clock.
00:44:17.870 - 00:44:59.760, Speaker B: And I guess, actually, Robert, there's a whole other thing to talk about there, which is this tension between the nature of audits, which almost function like a waterfall style development structure where you do a whole bunch of work and then get this whole thing audited, versus the iterative agile development structure that teams preferred. And this is another thing that I think Defi is really tough with because the audit concept is like this slow, chunky, clunky, audit constrained thing, whereas people want to develop in an agile, rapid, quick and easy way. And I don't know, I'd actually be curious what's compound's approach on that.
00:45:00.580 - 00:46:01.622, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, at compound we always moved really slow. It sucks, right? It sucks to have a six month build process where our process has always been probably two months of design where you're really just talking about things, starting to spec them out, really just arguing and debating and analyzing how things should work. Two months or so of building and then it's on testnet and it's about two months getting ready for launch. That's a six month cycle. If you look at traditional software startups, six months would sound mind numbingly horrible to ship code. Everyone who's coming out of Silicon Valley startups, they have one week sprints where sometimes in a week you're pushing to mainnet four times. It's just a completely different pace and scope to do things in what I would call doing them correctly.
00:46:01.622 - 00:46:22.690, Speaker C: Other teams in the space don't spend six months for major releases. They do them in four weeks. Right. Or two weeks or whatever. But our process has always been extremely long. And it's also, yes, as a product of us, starting in 2017, when nobody trusted smart contracts at all. But it's a long process to get to mainnet.
00:46:22.690 - 00:46:25.330, Speaker C: Things have to be beaten up a bit.
00:46:28.320 - 00:46:31.576, Speaker B: So we're actually going to try something. Robert? Oh, go ahead, Chris. Sorry.
00:46:31.688 - 00:47:33.026, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I was just going to say we've been trying to figure out a badger kind of what that in between is. And like, there's only so much that we could speak to because you talk about a six month release cycle and we've only been around three months. How much can we actually developed there? But, you know, the approach that we've taken is kind of a combo because, you know, that's, that's another big challenge right now is the the auditor. In the auditing landscape, it's become unbelievably difficult to nail down high quality auditors. It's like, you know, a three or four month wait and, like $200,000 to be able to nail them down. And then by the time, like, you're there, you have a whole slew of new contracts and new things that you're trying to bring to market. And I think that's, Rob, to your point, a little bit of the test and prod type mentality in motion, but nonetheless, on our side.
00:47:33.026 - 00:48:12.584, Speaker A: We obviously have the internal reviews and the build process, but we built out a smart contract advisory board that's internal, external, but they're compensated through BadGR. And all they do is review new code as we build it and as it progresses along with. If we're looking to do an integration like with UMa, for example, that board will review it amongst the internal team as well. And then we have, you know, an external auditing group. We've kind of been lucky to nail down a really solid one on a monthly basis, but then we have them kind of just. It's just like this rolling thing. They're constantly, always reviewing new things as they're.
00:48:12.584 - 00:49:12.870, Speaker A: As the board kind of finishes their review, as the internal team finished their review. And then with our network of other groups in the space, community oriented projects in the space, you kind of have this peer review process that we help each other out with. And again, just review the code and run tests and do whatever is necessary to determine the quality of that and any potential gaps. But that's what we've done to be able to enable us to move faster at the same time, to be able to. I think the difference here, too, is we tend to take the approach of build off of an existing foundation, rather than the floor up and the ground up. So even the things that we're bringing to market is more around integrating how they work with our system versus building a new system, if that makes sense. So it obviously requires different risk parameters.
00:49:13.730 - 00:49:16.270, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that makes total sense. Chris.
00:49:16.850 - 00:50:11.040, Speaker B: Yeah. Chris. So we're actually trying something where we're moving towards a retainer model with a top auditor, and we're trying to do this to do what you're trying to do, too, which is can we have an established code base that's thoroughly been audited and then have an auditor on retainer review, well encapsulated, pull requests that are changes to our system to let us actually attempt to make forward progress on something that doesn't look like a six month review cycle, but it's hard, man. And I want. It's one of the things I'd like the DeFi space to move towards and the audit space to move towards, too, is figuring out a way to do these audits on an ongoing basis, rather than this waterfall structure that I think slows things down. And then, because it slows things down, I think it actually. People skip out on audits and it makes the space less secure.
00:50:13.940 - 00:50:46.806, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the audit situation. Like, you know, Emiliano, he's been working on something called review Dao, which is more of, like, a peer review activity, which I think is a really interesting concept. But, you know, this. This is just going to be forced to evolve now just because it, you know, it's just they're way too tapped out auditors, and it becomes too difficult for new protocols to even be able to get their stuff reviewed. So they're kind of forced to, in some instances, degenerate. Right. You know, and that's not good for the space as a whole, either.
00:50:46.806 - 00:51:44.580, Speaker A: And, you know, I think we're going to see a lot more protocols come together from a peer review perspective, but also, like, to help secure funding, or, like, almost pool funding for different type of, you know, general, good for the. Good for the community, and good for the, you know, the defi ecosystem type stuff. Like, even if it's crowdfunding for large bug bounties across any smart contract, or even bug bounties in general, like we've been. We started working with a group called Immunefi. It must have been like a month and a half ago, and we put a $500,000 bounty on our critical vulnerabilities. And he said, listen, we'd rather pay out half a mil or more than lose $50 million of users funds. At the time, there was three or $400 million of users funds in there.
00:51:44.580 - 00:51:57.060, Speaker A: So the bug bounty space, the peer review, and crowdsource protection, that's just going to be forced to grow tremendously, which I think, overall would be good for the space.
00:51:58.200 - 00:52:21.580, Speaker B: Chris, that's actually a interesting idea, this peer review. Imagine we had a group of projects all pool together and review each other's pull requests, review each other's code, and maybe we all contribute our own project tokens that could get slashed if we fuck up. There's something kind of cool there. I think there's an interesting idea there, too, that I like.
00:52:23.880 - 00:52:35.220, Speaker A: I agree. I think it's going to evolve tremendously. Like I said, it's forced to just because of the state of the market, I'm sure cool stuff come out, which I'm excited about.
00:52:35.840 - 00:52:53.520, Speaker C: Oh, everything in crypto is an experiment, right? So all the ways that people organize and, you know, create is evolving. And so it'll be interesting to see if there's different standards that emerge and, you know, experiments that are successful and like, change the way people think about this stuff.
00:52:55.380 - 00:53:07.520, Speaker A: That'S for sure. Well, talking about change, I'd like to hear some updates about your guys's project. So, Rob, I know you guys had a pretty exciting announcement today, but you know, what's, what's going on with Gateway.
00:53:08.460 - 00:54:19.326, Speaker C: Yeah. So earlier today, we announced and launched the Testnet for Gateway, which was based on a white paper we wrote called compound chain. But it's basically a standalone chain called Gateway that's meant to create one interest rate with assets from many different blockchains. So you can imagine it connecting to Ethereum, and having Ethereum assets supported, and connecting to Polkadot and having Polkadot assets supported, and connecting to Solana, and having Solana assets supported and connecting to binance chain and having binance chain assets. And all of these can be used in one interest rate market that looks and feels and works like compound. And it allows you to use an asset from one blockchain to borrow an asset on another blockchain. Um, it's a pretty simple and elegant sort of idea, and we think it's like a really useful way of sort of one bridging different blockchains together in a way that's not like making a wrapped token on another blockchain or like creating like a shadow token on another blockchain.
00:54:19.326 - 00:55:13.896, Speaker C: So instead of having like wrapped eth on four different blockchains, you know, having a system where you can basically use real ethan and borrow other assets and transfer value between blockchains easily. And there's a lot of advantages to this. Instead of trying to wrap tokens and have them on this random side chain and try to port value for every second that assets are on gateway, they're earning interest, and you can actually use them to borrow other assets. And assets sitting on this bridge chain are delightful. They're not annoying, they're not high cost, you're not like, oh, like, moving between chains is a pain in the ass. Ideally, moving between chains is as delightful as supplying assets to compound where you're earning interest. You can transfer those balances to other users or other contracts or your friends or whatever.
00:55:13.896 - 00:56:01.240, Speaker C: And all the assets in compound are transferable and portable for hundredths of a cent, not extremely expensive amounts of money. So one day soon, this will launch. Right now we're in a testing phase where you can play around with the system, you can play around with Ethereum assets. There's no other connected blockchains yet, but it's running as a proof of concept in a prototype, you can play around with it right now, if you go to compound cache, click on the link that says dashboard and maybe the link that says dashboard guide, which teaches you what to do. But it's a working system, it's a prototype, it's Alpha. This is one of the examples of how we like to ship code. As soon as there's a testnet, we like to ship it.
00:56:01.240 - 00:57:07.310, Speaker C: We don't build something, wait for it to be ready for production and ship to production. We're meant to have a long test net process for people to poke holes, find issues, you know, find the flaws, find the warts, find things that could be more efficient, you know, better, faster, cleaner, different, and use it as an opportunity to polish, perfect and improve before shipping to mainnet and handling users assets. So today is the Testnet release. You know, if you remember the sort of timelines I laid out before where there's sort of two months of, you know, design, two months of building, and two months of prepost before launch. We just launched a testnet today, and so it's probably two to three months before the system goes to Mainnet, but it's a big opening day in a lot of ways that introduces the next phase of building. And from here, the community can start to build what we're calling starports on other blockchains. A starport is sort of like a contract used to upload assets to gateway and down from gateway to that blockchain.
00:57:07.310 - 00:57:44.110, Speaker C: And so now we can start building starports on other blockchains besides Ethereum. We can start testing the system with validators. Validators are going to make a lot of money by running the validation process for Gateway. And we're going to beat up and test the system in a lot of ways. We're going to stress it, we're going to run scenarios, we're going to try to break it, we're going to try to come up with all the fail scenarios for it before it goes to Mainnet. So today was awesome. You know, I recommend anyone here who's bored, you know, go to compound cash and learn about Gateway.
00:57:45.530 - 00:58:03.220, Speaker B: So, Rob, it's like, it's a really, really elegant design. I agree with that wholeheartedly. So, like, if I'm to ask the annoying question, what do you, what do you think? I, what's your biggest fear about it? What's your current biggest anxiety? Or do you think it's just going to work?
00:58:03.680 - 00:58:44.882, Speaker C: Yeah, well, the biggest issue right now is this is similar to when we launched the compound in 2018. I was like, it might be a long time before this is necessary. It still might be a long time before there's Defi really on many different blockchains, or there's good assets on many different blockchains. What's nice about this is it really future proofs the compound ecosystem. It gives a tool to build one market that spans the markets running on Ethereum right now with other blockchains. But it might be a year before it's really even necessary. Things will continue to run on Ethereum.
00:58:44.882 - 00:59:17.960, Speaker C: They'll continue to be important and useful and continue to be an integral part of the Defi ecosystem. And compound might have put a lot of effort into gateway, which people don't see being used for a couple of months. It might be a year before people are like, wow, this is necessary and useful. And my biggest fear is that it takes a while before there's the real use cases. Really awesome. Assets living on other blockchains, defi growing in other blockchains to make it necessary to bridge them in this way.
00:59:20.460 - 00:59:22.440, Speaker B: Cool. That sounds great, man.
00:59:22.980 - 00:59:36.640, Speaker A: So Rob, tell me about the composability across these different chains. Are you primarily going to look at EVM compatible changes from a tooling perspective? To start, how are you guys thinking about that?
00:59:37.180 - 01:00:17.280, Speaker C: Yeah, what's really cool is it's actually up to the community entirely on what chains come next and how the chain is governed by comp token holders in a very similar manner to how the compound protocol is governed right now. It's not really up to me what happens to the compound protocol. The community can do whatever it wants with it without needing my permission, without needing my input. It's going to function very similarly for gateway. If the community wants to build a starport on Polkadot, they can. If they want to build a starport on binance chain, they can. If they want to build one on Celo, they can.
01:00:17.280 - 01:00:57.550, Speaker C: If they want to, whatever they want to build one on Tron, they can. And it's up to the community. And maybe the Solana community wants to build the compound gateway Starport on Solana. Great. The development and upgrading of this system is open to others to build. And so I'm actually curious and just excited to see where folks want to take this where development energy gets concentrated and I'm sort of, once we start to get the testnet running smoothly and move towards production, I'm going to sit back and just watch without an opinion on where it's supposed to go next.
01:00:59.090 - 01:01:04.242, Speaker A: Yeah, but with that being said, without imposing your will.
01:01:04.306 - 01:01:06.110, Speaker B: Yeah. What is your opinion, Rob?
01:01:07.360 - 01:01:17.540, Speaker A: Like where, how do, how do you, how do you see it evolving? Like even in the community's hands, with all their types of, you know, with their ability to make different decisions, like how do you see it evolving?
01:01:18.240 - 01:02:08.230, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean the way I see it evolving is wherever, you know, really big valuable assets are, that's where it should expand. Right. So like if you know a bunch of like billion dollar assets on it, that would be a great chain to expand to and integrate. It would be great to build one cohesive interest rate market that spans all the popular ethereum assets we have with a couple other billion dollar assets. If it's a chain like Tezos, yes, you could absolutely create a star port on it today. And maybe it's amazing to connect Ethereum assets with tezzis, but there's not really any other tokens that have large volume market cap and liquidity. So it might be like a really high energy, low output endeavor and maybe thats a bad chain.
01:02:08.230 - 01:02:52.272, Speaker C: So I actually think the best part is going to be waiting a couple of months and seeing which chains start to get assets and why theres no rush to integrate additional chains. I actually think this process is going to take a long time to play out, much longer than people think. My gut is that there's probably going to be a couple big assets on Polkadot. There's probably going to be a couple big assets on ledgers we don't even anticipate yet. People could connect gateway to flow, the NFT blockchain. There's all sorts of crazy permutations in there. I actually think the community should take it a little bit slow and just see where the assets are that need to be integrated.
01:02:52.272 - 01:03:21.300, Speaker C: One day there's going to be us treasuries on some blockchain. I don't know if the US treasury or investment banks or whatever are going to issue those tokens on Ethereum. They might make their own blockchain. They might use a special purpose one for an industry consortium, they might issue them on tezos, who knows? But wherever the big assets start to pop up is where I think gateway should build. Starports.
01:03:22.280 - 01:03:31.580, Speaker B: Rob, like, random technical question, does it make sense for a Starport to be built on Ethereum? Layer two or not.
01:03:31.880 - 01:03:54.950, Speaker C: You actually could. So you can basically build one anywhere that has smart contracts. So you could build a starport on optimism one day. You can build a starport on f two too. Even for traversing between different Ethereum segments. You could build those starports, and that could actually be a really cool and logical first step as well.
01:03:55.250 - 01:04:11.030, Speaker B: And I guess actually it'd be kind of cool because if you did do that, actually. So let's say you had USDC on optimism versus USDC on ethereum layer one. Could they have different interest rates?
01:04:11.980 - 01:04:24.748, Speaker C: Yes, but within gateway, they would be two different assets. It would be like optimism USDC and Ethereum USDC. And they might have different interest rates.
01:04:24.924 - 01:04:28.324, Speaker B: And somebody would arb them right. If they did.
01:04:28.372 - 01:05:23.040, Speaker C: Savvy user might just provide that liquidity to sort of draw the capital between chains as needed. The really cool thing about gateway versus how compound works today, and this is one of the things that people discover as they start to go into the docs and into the testnet to experience. The risk and liquidity models on gateway are much more advanced than the compound protocol today. And so stablecoins will be extremely efficient collateral to borrow other stablecoins about 100 times more efficient than compound protocol today. So it's going to open up crazy use cases like borrowing USDC on optimism, using Ethereum USDC at 100 x leverage, and making a fortune for small interest rate differentials.
01:05:23.860 - 01:05:28.440, Speaker B: So does that end up looking like a curve competitor? In a weird way.
01:05:29.030 - 01:05:31.530, Speaker C: In a weird way, yes. Yeah, for sure.
01:05:33.390 - 01:05:33.982, Speaker B: Cool.
01:05:34.086 - 01:05:39.090, Speaker A: How does this play into the bitcoin network? Would you be able to build a star port for the bitcoin network?
01:05:39.790 - 01:06:13.440, Speaker C: You know, it's possible that, like, lightning gets advanced enough at some point to support, you know, contracts, something like that. Absolutely. Like, you know, on bitcoin, you know, just the l one blockchain. I don't necessarily think, like, it's easy. You know, it's possible that maybe with some combination of, like, you know, time lock hashes and stuff, you can do it. Maybe, you know, it would require some real R and D, but the answer is possibly.
01:06:16.340 - 01:07:21.246, Speaker A: But, you know, when I, when you think about billion dollar assets, right, like, I see the first, like, you know, just look at other chains and what happens? So, you know, what are some of the biggest assets on? I don't know. Tron was USDT and, you know, the stable coins and, and bitcoin for the most part. And you're looking at other chains and they have this fragmented, they fragmented, you know, asset diversification across chains. But it's kind of all the same assets. It's just, what are the incentives on those chains to bring them there and use them? So do you see, like, the first iteration when there is multiple chains? I guess you suggested it could be a long time, which I can. Which I. Which I agree with, but do you see it really just being like, okay, we're going to bring bitcoin from Polkadot and bitcoin from Solana and bitcoin from ETH, and, you know, and then there's just kind of this interesting aRB money market in between that allows people to do different types of, you know, financial activities that they couldn't do before in a single asset world.
01:07:21.246 - 01:07:22.730, Speaker A: I mean, single chain world.
01:07:23.510 - 01:07:36.410, Speaker C: Yeah. The answer is yes. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out. There's a lot of unknowns still, but, you know, I think if you look a year forward, there's going to be all sorts of funky things like that.
01:07:39.270 - 01:07:45.866, Speaker A: Yeah, that's cool stuff. I dig it, man. Congrats on getting to test net. It's a big. It's a big advancement. Good for you. Yeah.
01:07:45.898 - 01:07:57.750, Speaker C: Thank you. Yeah. Testnet is still a big journey to Mainnet. We're not celebrating too quickly, but it feels really good to get this out there to the point where people can start to play around with it.
01:07:58.650 - 01:08:01.990, Speaker A: I like the name. I like cash. That's really cool. That was a good idea.
01:08:02.450 - 01:08:11.310, Speaker C: Yeah. It's meant to be an incredibly generic, I don't even call it a stable coin, a completely generic unit of account.
01:08:13.520 - 01:08:34.820, Speaker A: Is there going to be? Is there going to be? I would assume no, but I don't know. Would there be the level of scrutiny and rigorous kind of standards for assets being able to port to or even if there was a starport, be able to come into this universal money market?
01:08:35.480 - 01:09:14.855, Speaker C: Yeah. So the answer is these standards are actually going to be lower than compound protocol on Ethereum today by a lot. This is actually a good thing. So one of the sort of features out of the gate that gateway is going to support is sort of what we're calling supply caps, where it's like limiting how much of an asset can be used on the chain. And so this is something that we sort of like, for a long time wanted to build into compound. But, you know, the original code base is a little bit old, and so it's a little bit unwieldy to build this in, but it's going to make it easy to say, yeah, we can take almost any asset, maybe only $5 million of it, see how the market grows. Right.
01:09:14.855 - 01:09:55.900, Speaker C: But just take small amounts of many assets, especially because the ability to do computations on gateway is so much better than the ability to do computations on Ethereum. And solidity, it's going to allow just a huge increase in throughput. So small assets are welcome. We may as well have 1000 small assets, none of which individually are big enough to pose a risk. And collectively there's enough diversification that there's no real concerns. But it could support hundreds of assets in a way that compound today just can't.
01:09:56.600 - 01:10:02.150, Speaker B: And then, Robert, the supply caps would be increased by governance, by comp token holder. Governance?
01:10:02.320 - 01:10:13.590, Speaker C: Yeah, comp token holders control literally every single parameter of the chain. So just like they do proposals today to change parameters, they're going to do the exact same thing.
01:10:14.530 - 01:10:42.294, Speaker A: Well, what is, we talked about this earlier, kind of like a tighter grip on the control of the system as time goes on and moving more towards the centralization. I think this could be a little different just because of the nature of how long comps been market. But this is all new tech. So what's the plan around that? Like, is there going to be stopgates that the team manages, the team controls? How is that going to look?
01:10:42.462 - 01:11:24.790, Speaker C: No, there's going to be no functions that our team has that the validators don't. We're not going to be a privileged party at all when it launches. I think the best way to sort of launch this safely is to put real limits on the size of the markets. Limit each market to $5 million of assets where you don't have any privileged access or controls. But the markets are small enough that if there is a disaster, you're not vaporizing a billion dollars, you're vaporizing like 10 million, something small enough that honestly, comp token holders have enough resources to be able to handle a small disaster. Right. Just not a billion dollar disaster.
01:11:26.530 - 01:11:42.550, Speaker A: Interesting, because that, would you argue that kind of goes against what you were saying earlier, though, Rob, around that, because it's new tech, it's, you know, you're going through the strenuous six month process as you usually do, except this is much less tested than your existing contracts.
01:11:43.170 - 01:12:04.470, Speaker C: Yeah, we want this one to be battle tested before it launches, when it launches, to have limitations in place which compound never did. Right. There was never really limitations on the size of the market and prove the Lindy effect over time. And as it starts to get proven, I'll start to raise those limits and let the assets start to scale.
01:12:05.330 - 01:12:14.150, Speaker B: Trey, I think that makes sense, though, given where you're at now, having a different approach to launching this versus how you launched comp. Right, Rob?
01:12:14.490 - 01:12:46.450, Speaker C: Right. There's a couple other differences at this point. When we originally launched compound, there was only our team. And so it made a lot of sense for only our team to sort of have the emergency buttons when we launched something like this. You don't want a blockchain to have emergency buttons at the end of the day. You want a blockchain to have really no ability for anybody to tamper with it. I think that has to Trump know, sort of short term security concerns.
01:12:49.270 - 01:12:55.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing around with it, that's for sure.
01:12:57.230 - 01:13:13.370, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I imagine by Friday of this week it's going to get smooth and fun to play around with. We really did ship a pretty alpha prototype of it today. So you can play around with it right now. There might be a couple of quirks. It might be a little unwieldy. But, you know, by Friday of this week, it's going to be pretty smooth.
01:13:14.270 - 01:13:26.358, Speaker A: Sweet, man. I dig it. I dig it. Well, Hart, let me ask you, I want to get a feel for what's going on in Numa land. I know we got a couple things cooking, but you know, what's been the latest and greatest over there?
01:13:26.534 - 01:14:37.150, Speaker B: Yeah, we do have shit cooking, Chris, which is cool. The latest and greatest is just sort of a realization that there's this primitive of taking an ERC 20 asset as collateral and then designing a payout function that can be really arbitrary to then create a synthetic token, a derivative token. I think we're actually realizing that this concept is ludicrously powerful, that we can do. Actually, a lot of ideas here, Chris. What we're doing with Badger is this idea of taking Badger vault tokens and using them as collateral and then defining a payout token where we're going to create a synthetic token that's worth a dollar of that collateral at some expiry date. And all of a sudden we've just created a zero coupon bond and a stable asset on one of these badger tokens. Which is pretty cool because now we're taking what is otherwise a relatively illiquid and sort of unproductive asset.
01:14:37.150 - 01:15:15.432, Speaker B: It's being productive because the badger token itself is like. It's a bunch of underlying things doing interesting stuff. But we're now doing another layer of taking this asset that's relatively illiquid and making it into something useful, which is cool. It's like alchemy. Then we realized recently we can use the exact same primitive, this synthetic token primitive to create call options on any ERC 20 asset. We're actually going to publish something about this tomorrow, which I think is wild. Then we've got this whole idea of KPI options.
01:15:15.432 - 01:15:45.170, Speaker B: We can create options that will pay out a projects token based on any KPI. And then we've got a whole design for perpetual synthetic tokens that we're pushing out, we're going to test next week. So there's just a whole bunch of shit going on where we realized we can do this alchemy of transforming ERC 20 collateral into any arbitrary synthetic token. And there's a hell of a lot we can do there.
01:15:47.920 - 01:16:49.256, Speaker A: Yeah, there was an article that a community member wrote from Badger just around and we didn't even think about it as much about this like this, excuse me, but like you have this explosion of capital going into new protocols, into protocols in general, and it's being productive as you said, but it's relatively liquid. Like just in general. Most assets like, you know, you take, let's just use tokenized bitcoin for example. Like you can take it to aave, you can take it to compound, you could take it to maker, you can go to sushi or curve or, or uniswap. But once you deposit there, like there's definitely more use cases for CNA tokens or CWBTC and AWBTC. But for the most part, you know, becomes illiquid, right? Yeah. And that's gonna, you know, that really it should show, it should start to become clear for the community and the ecosystem as a whole that it's.
01:16:49.256 - 01:17:22.282, Speaker A: Because that's like as primitive as it gets. Right. Like there's going to be layers, layers on top of layers. And I believe the synthetic protocols like Uma are really going to help unlock that illiquid value. And more importantly it's going to help the greater defi ecosystem because it's going to give them the ability or give users the ability to continue on their journey and continue participating. Right. Because you've been able to unlock that at different stages and I, you know, I couldn't be, I couldn't be more fired up about, you know, just that concept in general.
01:17:22.282 - 01:17:28.350, Speaker A: Forget like Uma, forget badger for just in general, like what that's going to do for the space. I mean it's just going to be massive.
01:17:28.890 - 01:18:26.720, Speaker B: Yeah. Well Chris, this is something you and I have talked about a bunch that I think is really like just a really smart insight or observation on your part, which is this idea that you want to be a middle money Lego in this stack of Lego blocks? You want to keep stacking them. And if you're a project with a token or whatever else, you want that collateral to be in the middle of this Lego stack. Because not only does it demonstrate that you're being used to build something, if a badger vault collateral is actually stacked in the middle of this Lego stack and then it's being used to create a zero coupon bond or being used as collateral for something else or whatever else it might be, that's just good for Badgr. That just means that vault collateral is useful for the protocols perspective. It also creates stickier assets. It means your assets aren't going anywhere.
01:18:26.720 - 01:18:55.200, Speaker B: So I do think that this process of alchemy, of taking ERC 20 assets and then converting them into something else, that is at one level what compound does and gateway is doing it now cross chain. But this idea of I got this one thing, I want to swap it for this other thing and you just keep going on your journey as you call it. That's freaking powerful, man. I think that's really cool.
01:18:58.100 - 01:19:36.530, Speaker A: Yeah, I obviously agree with you. I mentioned to like you guys obviously can't build all these cool things that you're talking about. How are you guys connecting with? Have you seen just naturally with so many new projects in the space and also some of the newer projects from mid last year maturing a little more and getting rid of some of the ones that didn't survive that up and down swing? But how are you guys collaborating with different developers and different teams to have them? Because you can't build all these different things. How are you guys looking at that way?
01:19:37.270 - 01:21:06.520, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been playing with this concept of developer mining that I know badger and you are also interested in. And it's this idea of taking the incentive structures that Robert and compound led with around yield farming and being like, okay, that was incredibly useful for driving liquidity into various defi protocols. What if we can try to use the similar concepts to instead incentivize another really extremely important component, which is developers? And the difference here is we're trying to position UMA as a developer infrastructure itself. So can we use similar concepts to incentivize developers to build on our infrastructure and frankly reward them for their own ingenuity and their own good ideas? Answer turns out we can. And this has been happening pretty quietly. But we've had a massive each week we have about ten new ideas that get proposed in our governance system now from developers that want to build various synthetic tokens. And it's actually been a really powerful concept to try to reward builders using our infrastructure based on a measurable metric of their own ideas, popularity.
01:21:10.980 - 01:21:12.040, Speaker C: Hell yeah.
01:21:13.460 - 01:22:22.578, Speaker A: Hell yeah is. Right? Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's, you know, one of that, that's one of the challenges, right? Like, I think people are experiencing these challenges across a variety of different areas. One, it's like, you know, if talented developers can build something and like, like Rob was saying, like you can go to market in a week or two with a couple people and you know, in some instances, like turn that into millions of dollars, like in the same short time frame, like the opportunity cost of not doing that as a talented developer versus kind of working with or working on existing protocols or in collaboration with those protocols. It even spans like hiring folks, right? Like a lot of people talk about just the crunch in hiring really talented developers in our space. I think we can all attest to it. But just in general, having the right incentives are absolutely critical. And those incentives need to speak to, obviously compensation, but they also need to speak to, say, shared ownership.
01:22:22.578 - 01:23:22.470, Speaker A: Because why would I put my blood, sweat and tears into building something and then not have a say in the thing that I build? Like that really doesn't jive. And that's where the power of governance tokens when implemented properly can actually bridge that gap. Because if you have different type of incentive programs that based on tangible things like being able to bring revenue to a protocol because of the product that you're building with that protocol, or for that protocol wherever it may be, and then in turn earning a percentage of tokens, or tokens in general that allow you to then govern said pro send product that keeps that skin in the game, that keeps that shared ownership. And that's necessary to really delineate between, hey, I'm just going to go work for someone and work or work for a company, excuse me, and build some cool shit, or like, you know, just build my own and just degen it and, you know, bring it to market quickly, right?
01:23:23.370 - 01:24:31.808, Speaker B: I mean, Chris, like 100%, man, and you're like the king of this in some ways, but go back through how we even got here. Stock options have been around for a long time as a way to incentivize an employee of a company to sort of be aligned with the success of that company. But that's just within the walls of that company. We're now creating these incentive structures that are actually like grassroots, community driven and Badgr is this unbelievable example of building a community that did not exist six months ago, maybe six months ago, Chris, you can tell me better. It didn't exist eight months ago, right? You went from zero to something massive because you were able to align incentives and because you were able to give the community ownership in the thing they're building. And the evidence is in your own protocol about how successful that is and how many people you can get involved and the degree of energy that happens in that. And it's fucking wild, man.
01:24:31.808 - 01:24:42.340, Speaker B: It's unbelievably cool that that's possible with this weird crypto thing that lets us build and design incentive structures in ways we were never able to before.
01:24:43.530 - 01:25:14.422, Speaker A: You know what's funny to that point, Hart, and this ties it all together. Rob, this must have been maybe October, I'd say maybe the latest November. And we were talking about Badger and you said something like, you know, you're going to need a lot of people to build that out, man. Something like that. Like what you're talking about is pretty crazy. You're going to need a lot of people. And, you know, we just did our grants program for the month today and I just posted like right before we jumped on this and it's.
01:25:14.422 - 01:25:42.140, Speaker A: It's fucking nuts, dude. There's 58 contributors all earning badger every month and 98% of them have no legal name associated with their contribution. Right? Like, it's crazy. It's like so nuts. And to your point, Hart, it starts from, you know, it really just starts from people having that aligned. I believe, honestly, I think a lot of it. And this is where I think some folks miss.
01:25:42.140 - 01:26:35.472, Speaker A: It's not, it's not just about like giving that shared ownership and, you know, being really inclusive and working very closely around important decisions with this community early on. It's also about having a shared value and belief system. All right? And that shared value and beliefs is an almost shared mission. Like, for us, it's obviously bitcoin and bringing bitcoin to open finance. But even before we started, we identified 32,000 wallet addresses that either participated in decentralized governance over the last couple of years, used bitcoin and defi over the last couple of years, including compound, acre and balancer and all these types of things, and also supported public goods. And, you know, between these addresses, these are the ones that said, okay, hey, come and. Come and claim your badger.
01:26:35.472 - 01:26:48.460, Speaker A: And from day one it was people that had that, that shared belief system. And I think that's extremely critical when trying to build out a community, especially if the community genuinely is going to be leading whatever you're building, you know?
01:26:48.920 - 01:27:14.114, Speaker B: Yeah. Chris, every time we talk, man, I tell you this. I just mean it. It's like you have fucking nailed, I think, two important, extremely important things. You've just done it, you've executed on it exceptionally well. One is a clear mission that actually resonates with people, which is, okay, let's bring bitcoin to defi. Clear, simple mission.
01:27:14.114 - 01:27:33.080, Speaker B: I'll be honest, when you were talking about this, I didn't think it'd be that big a deal. I was wrong. There's people that care about this on a lot of them. Right. And then the other thing is you just authentically did it. Community first from day one. You know, you're not in it to like make a bunch of money for yourself or whatever else.
01:27:33.080 - 01:27:46.740, Speaker B: You're in it to build this thing with the community and have the community be successful. And it like, it shows. And those two things like, just fucking work. It's wild and. Yeah. I don't know, man. It's just cool.
01:27:50.850 - 01:28:07.258, Speaker A: Sure is, man. It's fun. Well, guys, we're at 90 minutes. I feel like the 90 minutes mark, I tend to get a little drowsy and a little beat up. Why don't. What do you guys think about opening the floor a bit, having a few people jump up and then we'll wrap up after that? What do you think?
01:28:07.394 - 01:28:08.570, Speaker B: Let's do it.
01:28:08.730 - 01:28:18.730, Speaker A: Alrighty. Alright, we got Chad and Tom. Chad from Roon, Tom from power trade, if I'm not mistaken.
01:28:21.150 - 01:28:22.210, Speaker C: What's up, guys?
01:28:22.590 - 01:28:23.414, Speaker A: What's up, buddy? What's up?
01:28:23.422 - 01:28:24.010, Speaker B: Tom.
01:28:25.990 - 01:28:27.798, Speaker D: Hart? I had a question for you.
01:28:27.974 - 01:28:28.350, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:28:28.390 - 01:29:25.570, Speaker D: When you mentioned that when you started Uma, you wanted to create this like defi margin system, which sounded like it was, it had a much. That vision had a much bigger scope than, than where Uma is today, which is normal for a startup. You have to start something achievable and build yourself up to that vision. I'm wondering, one thing I see missing in Defi in general is cross margining. So if you are, say you're minting a position in Uma, maybe you're minting some y dollars with bitcoin collateral and then you're minting y dollars with eth collateral. Those positions themselves are not cross margined with each other. And then you might be having other positions and they're all kind of like isolated margin, right?
01:29:25.870 - 01:29:26.678, Speaker B: Yep.
01:29:26.854 - 01:29:31.610, Speaker D: Do you see a way to solve that cross margining problem?
01:29:32.310 - 01:30:41.784, Speaker B: Yes, I think we just aren't quite there yet, but we're going to probably get there fast. So just actually, so for everybody to understand what Tom's talking about, if I have to lock up a lot of capital to mint asset a, and I have to lock up other capital to mint asset b, but if assets a and b are offsetting, I really shouldn't have to lock up capital on both sides to mint them. And I think that there's a lot to do here all about making things more capital efficient. And I just think that's the way DeFi is going to evolve. I think our strategy or structure is to put as much of the logic monitoring this off chain as possible. A general theme in the way we look at the world is that the rules of the game should be written on the blockchain, but monitoring whether those rules are actually being followed or not, should all be done off chain, where it's that much cheaper to do. And I think we're just on the path to getting there.
01:30:41.784 - 01:30:56.680, Speaker B: I think it's going to happen fast, and I think stuff is going to become increasingly more capital efficient, both with synthetic assets and then with just cross margining and all these just defi products in general.
01:30:58.940 - 01:30:59.340, Speaker A: Cool.
01:30:59.380 - 01:31:01.320, Speaker D: So not ready to talk about specifics?
01:31:02.300 - 01:31:59.244, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have any. Like, I think the biggest specific that I'm interested in, that's in the vein of what you're talking about, is how to make synthetic assets, the liquidity provision of synthetic assets, more capital efficient. So right now, on all these synthetic programs or products, ours included, you have the token holders which buy the synthetic asset. So fine, that's all well and good, but then you have minters who are creating the synthetic assets, and then liquidity providers who are often minting synthetic assets and then putting it in the amm pool. And there's actually a lot of capital inefficiency here, where the people minting the assets have to over collateralize them, and then they put them in an amm pool. That isn't that there's actually not a lot of risk there. The protocol is way over collateralized if you look at it from that lens.
01:31:59.244 - 01:32:22.470, Speaker B: And I think that one of the things that I'm really curious about is looking at how to increase the capital efficiency by effectively combining the minter and liquidity provider roles into something that would let you have a much more capital efficient structure for that side of the trade.
01:32:23.970 - 01:32:34.230, Speaker D: That would be very interesting. The new perps rollout could be interesting as well. You could have 30% collateralized positions, something like that.
01:32:35.210 - 01:32:36.138, Speaker B: Totally.
01:32:36.314 - 01:32:39.098, Speaker D: If you're just paying the funding, it.
01:32:39.114 - 01:33:07.310, Speaker B: Goes back to this idea of, if we do this synthetic token alchemy, where we take an ERC 20 asset and we have a payout function to create another ERC 20 asset, there's nothing wrong. If the first. If the collateral asset, that ERC 20 asset, is something weird, right? It could be another synthetic. You could do weird recursive loops of what that thing is in a way that I think could be extremely capital efficient and really, really interesting.
01:33:11.460 - 01:34:07.306, Speaker D: Indeed. And I just want to give a shout out to both the compound team and the UMA team in what year is this? 2021 in 2019. Everybody was still pretty skeptical about whether DeFi was going to work. I mean, other than people that were deep in Defi and everyone, there was this kind of, like, realization, I think, within the Defi community that governance tokens were about to be a thing. But the rest of the crypto community was still highly skeptical. And so there was two key events in my mind that really kicked off the defi boom and having people see the value here. The first one was Uma creating a uniswap pool to launch their token.
01:34:07.306 - 01:34:51.142, Speaker D: And it was the first major time that Uniswap was used for an initial listing. And so that was, I think, a very important event that made everybody go, hey, something's happening over here. What is going on? And then the second one was compound launching the governance tokenization. And I think that made everyone realize, hey, these governance tokens are actually valuable, and they're useful, and they have a role in the ecosystem. So, yeah, kudos to both of you. In my mind, you guys kind of kicked off the whole defi boom cycle and made a lot of people realize that we're building some valuable shit here.
01:34:51.326 - 01:34:53.198, Speaker C: Thanks, Tom. Appreciate it.
01:34:53.214 - 01:34:55.720, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Tom. That's awfully nice.
01:34:58.220 - 01:35:00.880, Speaker A: Chad. How goes it, my friend?
01:35:01.820 - 01:35:16.892, Speaker E: Hey, Chris, how's it going? Good to talk to you again. Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Chris, for moderating. This has actually been, like, a really great conversation. I've been learning a lot. Just kind of do some house chores and listen to you guys talk about your projects and stuff. It's actually been really educational.
01:35:16.892 - 01:35:48.530, Speaker E: So I appreciate you guys spending the time to. To both Robert Hart and you, Chris. So, first of all, thank you for that. My question I have is for Robert. That's out of curiosity. It sounds like compound gateway is predominantly geared towards evms of different sorts. I'm curious to understand what went into the decision to go after evms versus evms plus other pows or what have you.
01:35:49.670 - 01:36:24.310, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question. And I think you're right, it really does focus on evms to start. And I think that's because it's a system that's meant to hopefully bridge different DeFi ecosystems. At least that's how we think about it. Compounds coming from the early defi days, and we're sort of defi centric in a lot of ways. So we're really looking at chains that have smart contracts on them that you might want to port liquidity to, to do other things with it. It's not a trading platform.
01:36:24.310 - 01:36:38.550, Speaker C: It's really just a way of porting value. And so for us, the sort of 80 20 rule and the lowest hanging fruit was where can we build a starport using a smart contract or an EVM?
01:36:42.740 - 01:37:26.530, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess my first thought would be my understanding, and you're welcome to correct me if I'm wrong, is one of the predominant use cases of something like a compound finance is to three x long. Your position on Ethereum or some other ERC 20 token. I'm quite confident that there's a lot of people in the crypto community who want to use like, you know, layer one bitcoin loans for not, not, you know, pegs, you know, run BDC and what have you, but, but real layer one stuff. I have to assume that's something that, that you guys are looking into or want a service or something like this.
01:37:27.710 - 01:37:46.340, Speaker C: I mean, it's a lot of work to actually support native bitcoin. Um, yes, that would be amazing. It is not easy. Many teams have been working on it, and it is a herculean task, so to speak. And so, you know, I think the more logical place to start is probably the easier, lower hanging troop.
01:37:48.160 - 01:37:48.736, Speaker A: Well, Chad.
01:37:48.768 - 01:37:49.168, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:37:49.264 - 01:37:54.008, Speaker A: Herculean tasks, that's really what runes focused on, right?
01:37:54.144 - 01:38:37.348, Speaker E: Yeah, he's. Robert's absolutely correct when he calls it a herculean task. Connecting to, like, a layer one bitcoin, for example, is quite complicated for a whole host of reasons. There's economic concerns, there is complexities like reorgs and this kind of stuff. The Thor chain team kind of made it a vision from the get go to have a requirements in terms of being able to bridge two particular chains to be that, that requirement to be as narrow as possible or as little as possible. So in theory, that the Thor chain network can. Peg.
01:38:37.348 - 01:39:06.460, Speaker E: Not peg, excuse me, but connect to any layer one or even L2. Hell, like it can do L2. Layer two to L2 if it really wanted to. When the bitcoin. I'm sorry, when the for chain network launches, the second network, at least in a few weeks, it'll support five different chains. It'll be bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin, cash, litecoin, and Binance. To Robert's point, our first network was just binance only.
01:39:06.460 - 01:40:04.740, Speaker E: We chose Binance because it was a relatively easy chain to connect to. It has instant finality, for example, so you don't have to worry about reorgs or confirmation counts or any of these kind of complexities. And we felt that the binance community really didn't have any defi, so there was a kind of a need to be filled there. And so we decided to launch the first kind of chaos net solely on binance to support that community and to prove the economics, prove the security, prove that all the economic assumptions that we've made work out beyond the audits and reviews and all these things that we went through and actually tested real world commissions and make sure everything is as secure as we would like. And today we have, I think, close to $300 million tVL on that chain. And it's been going on for, I think, five months now, six months, something like this. Yeah.
01:40:04.740 - 01:40:54.392, Speaker E: I'm hoping that we can, we can move defi into a way that is chain agnostic, asset agnostic, doesn't know or care where you're coming from, whether it's bitcoin, whether it's litecoin, whether it's dogecoin, zcash, monero, you name it. It all can be interfaced into defi applications that give you layer one connection to defi. So, Thor chain's initial application is kind of like a uniswap, and exchanging access to a CLP using a slip base, uh, fee model. But there's no reason why we can't add something like what compounds do it. And compound is like the first. And, like, in, uh, total respect for, for the compound team, what they've done, it's a fantastically well developed, well engineered, smart contract. They've done excellent work.
01:40:54.392 - 01:41:54.950, Speaker E: Uh, uh, and that's the reason why this, this, uh, torching can't do the same thing. But instead of just doing for Ethereum, you can do it for any change. You can provide capital as ETH or dogecoin, and then get bitcoin out on the other side of it, and get like a loan, and only a loan, but actually potentially even a fixed rate loan, like an actual fixed, fixed rate loan, you are locked in for that time period of whatever your loan is, you get the time that you take it out. So there's really some great opportunity, and I'm really hoping that the larger community of Defi kind of pushes in this direction of chain agnostic Defi application that can service any chain, no matter where they're coming from. And I think a lot of things are happening in that way around the cosmos ecosystem as we're seeing more and more apps being developed and that ecosystem there, which is actually a really good model that they set over there. But, yeah, it's interesting to be fair. Robert, please don't get me wrong, I actually really like compound.
01:41:54.950 - 01:42:12.430, Speaker E: I love what you guys are doing. You guys are doing amazing work, amazing job. Total respect for you guys, a team and your model. You're talking before about, you know, taking it slower rather than faster. And we totally are with you 100% from that perspective. So you guys are doing great work.
01:42:14.130 - 01:42:15.710, Speaker C: Thanks, Chad. Appreciate that.
01:42:21.010 - 01:42:22.910, Speaker A: Grant, what's going on? Welcome.
01:42:24.290 - 01:42:58.962, Speaker B: Hey, what's going on? Yeah, thanks so much. It's been an awesome room. Great listening in. I had a question generally about interoperability across chain, and I know a couple of you guys are working on that, perhaps Leshner, if you want to weigh in, I had a question that's kind of two pronged. First was, you're thinking about Gateway. You're talking about how you're not going to take kind of the rapt approach. You're going to have legit ease being exchanged on top of Gateway and through starports.
01:42:58.962 - 01:43:18.400, Speaker B: Could you expand a little bit on how that would be happening and then also talk a little bit about what projects you took inspiration from as you were thinking about gateway in terms of past implementations of, you know, cross chain compatibility?
01:43:20.620 - 01:44:50.750, Speaker C: Sure, that's a great question. So for the first one, I would say, you know, just start with the docs. You know, like, I'd rather just jump to the second question, which is, you know, what was the sort of, like, thought process and inspiration for creating this? It kind of unfolded from the idea of saying, you know, one, how can you make a compound that in a autonomous, decentralized fashion supports more than just ethereum assets, where you have an interest rate market that's not limited to the eight or nine or ten, whatever assets that the protocol currently supports? How can you build a system that, like, supports the real, and I'm putting that in air quotes, that you can't see the real version of other assets. So that's the first question that sort of evolved into it. And then the second was in terms of, like, the actual bonding logic of how do you actually, like, bond assets from one chain and basically bond them into a new system that's at this point, like, starting to become sort of common technology. And we basically are just combining those two building blocks, bonding an asset on an l one to make it appear on the l two with the logic and the sort of business logic of what is a money market, to pass the assets back and forth between them. So that was sort of the thought process and the evolution that led to this.
01:44:53.650 - 01:44:54.850, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you.
01:44:54.970 - 01:44:55.990, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Grant.
01:44:58.890 - 01:45:00.880, Speaker A: Mike, how goes it?
01:45:01.500 - 01:46:06.590, Speaker F: Hey, guys. I had a question for Robert and Hart about regulation in defi. Like, we see a lot of protocols moving towards being meaningfully decentralized, partially as a mechanism to avoid being a target for regulation. But I guess my concern, or I wanted to know what your thoughts are, does that just move the target from the entities that they can't regulate that because they're not centralized, to where does that move the target? Because ultimately these regulators are going to look to regulate, perform their job as regulators, and prevent people from losing money in whatever means that people have to lose their money. I would think the nuclear option they have at the end of the day is to outlaw individuals from part participating in Defi, which I would hope it wouldn't come to it, but, like, is there some sort of happy medium where they can accomplish their goals as regulators and also in a way that can allow these protocols to continue to flourish?
01:46:08.810 - 01:46:10.098, Speaker B: Robert, you want to go?
01:46:10.234 - 01:47:17.280, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll go. So the key point that you just raised was prevent people from losing money. If you listen to what a lot of regulators are saying, that is their primary concern. That's pretty much always their primary concern. They want to prevent people from losing money. And there's a lot of ways that people lose money. I think this eye has sort of shifted away from like, oh, are people creating securities that could lose people money by people speculating and getting swindled or hoodwinked by flashy sales pitches to lose all of their money to what are these systems that are handling huge amounts of money and what keeps them safe? A lot of recent comments actually point towards a future in which regulators are more interested in communications around the safety of systems, how they work, whether or not they're audited, how they're audited, how the code is controlled and preventing the physical loss of funds, not through deception, so to speak, but through error.
01:47:17.280 - 01:48:22.792, Speaker C: And I actually do think that will be the future frontier of the intersection between DeFi and regulation, potentially, where regulators are literally analyzing how different autonomous protocols function, how they're built, how they're run, how they're maintained, and making sure that they're held to standards that protect user funds from getting vaporized or stolen. And I actually see that as a best case scenario in a lot of ways where the regulators are concerned about making sure that users are protected. And the scary risk of the future is protecting users from things going poof. And so they're going to be concerned and they're going to enforce standards that require everybody to sort of level up a bit to meet, you know, institutional grade finance grade systems, which, frankly, most of the industry does not even come remotely close to meeting and remotely doesn't try. So I think that'll be where more of the focus goes.
01:48:22.976 - 01:48:59.090, Speaker G: Robert, this is music to my ears. I know that we talked a bit about the lawn ticker change day, and I suspect that this is part of why you all chose substrate for your own chain, because this all boils down to governance and the ability to correct issues when they come up on chain. So I'm interested. Obviously, congratulations on the launch of the testnet today. But beyond governance obviously being a big part of it, what else went into your decision making process in terms of launching your own chain?
01:49:00.110 - 01:49:02.774, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, thanks, Peter.
01:49:02.822 - 01:49:16.650, Speaker G: I mean, the decision, full disclosure, I'm head of public affairs for parody. Robert and I have chatted about this for a while and obviously been working with Jared and the rest of your team on getting the thing up and running. So congrats.
01:49:17.030 - 01:49:20.158, Speaker A: So this is the layup then? So this is a layup question.
01:49:20.334 - 01:49:37.358, Speaker G: It's a layup, but also it ties. Ties in completely to a big part of why we all really realize the importance of governance. When you have a fiduciary responsibility, you can't say, oops, there's a bug, or we can't fix an issue on chain.
01:49:37.534 - 01:50:39.330, Speaker C: Right? And that responsibility is, over time, becoming less one team and more a community of users and stakeholders and token holders and the systems and applications that integrate them. When it came to the decision of launching a new chain, it really came down to whether or not this use case that we wanted could be met on its own. In a lot of ways, launching a chain was a last resort, not a first resort. And it was due to us not wanting to wait for a couple of years for things the ecosystem to mature compounds not meant to be a L2 scaling solution. It's really meant to create a market that natively supports many different blockchain assets. And the best way to accomplish that was to not wait for other things to exist, but to hurry up the future and launch a system that could basically begin to connect chains in the way we wanted them to exist.
01:50:42.280 - 01:51:31.552, Speaker A: You know. You know what I'd like to add here as it relates to governance, because it's been an interesting journey for us, being that we're not a legal entity and we've never been a legal entity and we manage billions of dollars and we've gone through some of these, we've been going through conversations with legal groups identifying potential frameworks for, for protocols like ours. And in the end of the day, you know, I think, Rob, to your point, is that a potential future state where it's more around, you know, how around the error side versus, you know, just total, call it robbery, call whatever you want, but deception, I think so. But I think that's much.
01:51:31.616 - 01:51:52.600, Speaker G: We're living this life right now already at parity with Polkadot. Right. It's a decentralized protocol. Any hiccups in the network, bugs, major hacks, any fixes need to go through governance. We just can't push a pull request in the middle of the night because we have the keys to a GitHub repo. It has to go through the community. So I think we're living it in a sense.
01:51:53.340 - 01:51:58.476, Speaker A: Yeah, living it. And what the regulators, how the regulators wrap their head around it are two different things. Right.
01:51:58.548 - 01:51:59.800, Speaker G: I think they like that.
01:52:00.240 - 01:52:07.808, Speaker A: Yeah. But they don't, they don't know. They don't know their left arm from the right arm. Right. When it's this, when it comes to this stuff. Right. So you're sitting in front of.
01:52:07.824 - 01:52:37.590, Speaker G: I wouldn't say they're completely unsophisticated, but um, you know, when it comes down to the nuance, especially like, you know, base layer protocol governance is a little more understandable than Defi protocol governance, where you're getting down to like, things are a lot more, how you say, the users of the protocol want to position how the protocol is used in their benefit in a different way than sort of like a base layer protocol. So I totally get that.
01:52:38.690 - 01:53:39.950, Speaker A: Yeah, no, and the point that I was really just trying to make was, you know, in the short term, there's. The regulators are going to come after the lowest hanging fruit, obviously, and there's. And when I say lowest hanging fruit, I mean, you know, clear bad actors and that, and that's going to be pretty easy pickings for them. And I think a lot of the protocols as we, as we work through this kind of weird, hey, they're figuring this whole thing out and we're moving towards what potentially you know, becomes this, this new world of Defi, you know, regulated DeFi or DeFi in a world with regulations, you know, I think a lot of protocols need to be putting up the right types of flags to say like, hey, we are a good actor. We are doing everything we can as relates to security posture and all this type of stuff that ensures the, or at least giving their best attempt at preventing loss of user funds. And I think that in the short term that's what we see. And then we eventually make our way, Rob, to the state that you discussed earlier as well.
01:53:42.370 - 01:54:07.530, Speaker F: What'S the prevent, like, the bad actors from like drawing like the wrong kind of scrutiny on the era. So like, let's say there was like an evil fork of compound that voted in some sort of predatory lending practice or something along those lines, like a version of payday loan practice where they, the borrowers sign away their future paychecks from a DaO that they work for or something like that.
01:54:08.230 - 01:54:08.942, Speaker B: Like that.
01:54:09.046 - 01:54:22.558, Speaker F: If something like that could even exist, certainly that would draw scrutiny to. And if that was something that was deployed on Ethereum, where would the regulators possibly, what could the regulators possibly do to regulate to prevent something like that.
01:54:22.574 - 01:55:17.720, Speaker B: From happening at that point? Mike, in my opinion, the regulators, in air quotes, the regulators will always can and will find somebody to go after, or at least they're not prepared to believe yet and maybe ever, that there's not ultimately somebody that they can go after when there is a bad actor. Because the entire concept of there being a bad actor means that like somebody is the ringleader of doing this bad thing and they'll go after them regardless of legal structure or whatever else. Right? But I just agree with Chris's point. It's like if the bad actors are plentiful, they're going to be the obvious scams and bad shit. We all want the regulators to go after them. That's like the right thing for our community and our ecosystem. And you have credible projects doing their very best to follow the spirit of what the regulators are doing and build.
01:55:17.720 - 01:55:18.580, Speaker B: Cool shit.
01:55:23.040 - 01:55:23.600, Speaker G: Thanks guys.
01:55:23.640 - 01:55:24.700, Speaker F: Appreciate the answers.
01:55:26.400 - 01:55:27.460, Speaker B: Thank you, man.
01:55:27.960 - 01:55:36.350, Speaker A: No problem. Peter, did you want to add anything? And doesn't look like anyone else has your hands up. So you have the, the last talking point if you like it.
01:55:39.170 - 01:56:36.260, Speaker G: No, I appreciate hearing more on the plans for compound chain. I've been looking forward to seeing how everything was going to work out in terms of your plans long term. I'm excited for what's to come. And obviously as the governance of such a chain expands, that's sort of in the wheelhouse of what we're excited about in terms of the future of this industry broadly. And I think Defi has been at the cutting edge of understanding how protocol level governance can be leveraged and not to be scared of this concept of on chain, stakeholder driven governance as an attack vector, rather being a place for value to be created broadly in this ecosystem for both the stakeholders and to help adoption. So, looking forward to see what happens.
01:56:36.680 - 01:56:49.580, Speaker C: Yeah, likewise. Same, and thanks for your organization building substrate as a great tool that we've been able to sort of piggyback on in the same way that so many teams have piggybacked on the compound code base.
01:56:53.290 - 01:57:01.830, Speaker A: All right, guys, well, Rob Hart crew here. Appreciate you guys spending some time. That was really great conversation a lot.
01:57:02.490 - 01:57:04.070, Speaker B: Yeah, Chris. That was fun, man.
01:57:05.730 - 01:57:06.258, Speaker A: Alrighty.
01:57:06.314 - 01:57:07.350, Speaker G: Thank you all.
01:57:07.930 - 01:57:15.282, Speaker A: We wrap it up. Rob Hart crew. Be well, everybody. Thanks for joining, and we'll. We'll talk soon.
01:57:15.426 - 01:57:17.310, Speaker C: Thanks, everybody. Go get them.
01:57:18.020 - 01:57:23.212, Speaker A: Go get him, daddy. Defi, over here. Go get him. Go. Break a leg, son.
01:57:23.396 - 01:57:25.600, Speaker C: I hope you're winning. Hope you're winning, son.
01:57:27.020 - 01:57:28.540, Speaker A: All right, everybody, be well. Ciao.
