00:00:00.240 - 00:00:35.096, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here and welcome to Farms of the week, where I'll be going over the farms I'm currently in as well as the farms I'm watching. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Alright, so let's start with the taro ecosystem, just because I haven't really talked about it recently, but you know, my setup has not changed. You know, this portfolio that I have here, I started with this particular portfolio where I put $10,000 into UST and 6.4k into Luna in early July. And now that value has appreciated the a little over two x in five to six weeks and this portfolio is yielding roughly 51%. It's, you know, it's pretty good.
00:00:35.096 - 00:01:10.608, Speaker A: I'm not going to go over the entire strategy because I have a whole playlist on it, so feel free to check that out if you're interested in how to set up this setup. But in terms of changes I've made, I've added more, I've borrowed more dollars, I've borrowed more UST against my collateral just because Luna has like three, like four x in value since I purchased it. My liquidation price is $15. I'm watching this carefully. It's kind of scary. But before I go on vacation on September 1, I'm going to probably just pay all of this back, or most of it back. Part of it is just sitting here on anchor earning 19.5%
00:01:10.608 - 00:01:36.436, Speaker A: and the rest is being used on mirror. Right now. If you go back to my page, in roughly five or six weeks, I've earned dollar 400 with mirror, which is pretty nice. Still shorting gold, still longing galaxy digital. It's, I mean, I'm pretty comfy with this setup. Like, I'm shorting gold just to collect the short farm APR and I'm longing galaxy to collect the long, long farm APR. And Galaxy is a stock I like.
00:01:36.436 - 00:02:10.880, Speaker A: So, you know, I just, I'm getting paid 30% to own a stock that I actually like, which is pretty nice. So historically, the short farm APR for gold is roughly 26% and the long form APR for galaxy is where is it? You can't find it always, right? Like roughly 33%. Right. So if you input the values here, 26, 33, and you put, you know, this is how much money I'm putting in, then this is how much I'm borrowing and this how much money I deposit in anchor and you get 51%. Right. So pretty good setup. I'm probably going to sell some mirror tokens.
00:02:10.880 - 00:02:44.374, Speaker A: I did a poll on my YouTube and on Twitter about like what? Like what's everyone's plans with mirror I and Anchor? It seemed like the consensus was like people are more bullish to anchor token over the mirror token. And I kind of agree. I do like the anchor token a lot more than the mirror token. If you look at the farm tokens for most decentralized exchanges, or just any exchange in general, it just kind of goes down over time. So I'm not too interested in thinking these types of inflationary tokens. At least with anchor I have roughly how much is it? $260 of anchor. At least this has a fixed supply which I'm a fan of.
00:02:44.374 - 00:03:19.938, Speaker A: And in terms of like, I guess news, there's this protocol called Nexus protocol. It's, it's not Nexus mutual, but it's a different protocol. And apparently there's going to be an exclusive airdrop for anchor governance stakers and they're going to be taking a snapshot in September. So if you, if you've farmed anchor in the past couple of months and you want this airdrop, I don't really know how much they're going to airdrop. But after this video, I'm probably going to clean this and just stake it in the govern tab here, right. And just earn 7% and this let us sit there. Alright, so that's what I'm doing for Terra, obviously, everyone.
00:03:19.938 - 00:04:01.580, Speaker A: There's so much hype around avalanche ecosystem mostly because of the avalanche rush, right? Like we've covered this for the past two weeks. I mean, you know, it's. We saw it coming, right? We saw it coming and now it's playing out. If you look into coingecko and you go to the avalanche ecosystem like literally everything is up. So I don't want to like go over like most of these, but I'll just highlight a few that I think is good. I guess for full disclosure, like, I'm not farming any of these right now because I'm like, my personal life is pretty busy right now so I'm not really entering forms the Degen farms just because I just don't have time to manage those positions. But the one thing I am farming is Benki, right? This is.
00:04:01.580 - 00:04:17.410, Speaker A: The Avalanche team has allocated $3 million liquidity mining program. This is my test account. So you don't see any balances here. But anyway. And there's always Ui bugs on Benki. But you can earn like roughly 10% on all these assets. And when you borrow you can earn.
00:04:17.410 - 00:05:03.280, Speaker A: Okay, you can't really see it, but you can earn decent APIs. So I made this video on August 20 a few days ago, but you can see like, hey, you can be paid 2% in bitcoin if you deposit your bitcoin here, but also you'll be paid 13% paid in Avax tokens and key tokens. And obviously the key token has done pretty well. I'm not sure how, how this token will do when Aave launches, but you know, we'll see, right? It is a farm token, so I suggest everyone be careful with it. So I'm in Benki in terms of other ecosystems that, you know, that you should look into, perhaps is pangolin, right? Pangolin is, I guess like the quick swap of avalanche. It's the decentralized exchange with the highest TVL. The rates aren't that good, but it's something.
00:05:03.280 - 00:05:40.890, Speaker A: And you can use auto compounders like yieldiac, right? They have really slick UI and snowball, right? They're both auto compounders. They also have stablecoin swaps, but I think they're mostly a yield aggregator. And in terms of the second to largest decentralized exchange on avalanche, it's Trader Joe, right? This is Trader Joe xyz.com, also pretty, pretty slick UI. I think they forked matcha, right, with the UI and whatnot. But the one cool thing that they have is you can zap token. So if you have, let's say a bunch of USDT and you want to enter the Joe evac pool, you can just take 1000 USDT and just swap it directly right into.
00:05:40.890 - 00:06:13.826, Speaker A: You can just lp immediately with one transaction. Obviously you'll be paying gas, but this is like a more user friendly tool. And usually I'm not a fan of auto compounders, right? Like if you think about what I said back in Polygon, I, I said like, auto compounders are not worth the risk for me. However, because avalanche fees are kind of high, right? You'll be paying like four or $5 transaction fee sometimes. Perhaps it is like something like a yodiac or a snowball. That's worth it for you, right? Obviously I'm talking about the product, right? Not the token. So I have no idea how the token will do.
00:06:13.826 - 00:06:43.100, Speaker A: But you know, this is something to look into. There's this thing called penguin finance as well. This is just a general farm. I'm assuming that there's going to be more applications coming online on avalanche every single week, right? That's the whole point of a humble farmer thesis, right? Like once a money market comes online and once a bunch of money flows into the ecosystem, then devs are going to flow into the ecosystem and like build their own application. So just check out for news. Just I guess follow my channel. Follow me on Twitter.
00:06:43.100 - 00:07:15.664, Speaker A: Follow avalanche on Twitter just so you can get like the latest news. Lastly, this is avalanche. This is like a launchpad for the avalanche ecosystem. You can go to the farming tab and earn roughly 86% lp ing for the avalanche token, which is zava and Avax. So something to look into, right? So hopefully that was a good one. These are right now, I think these are the main, I guess, forms on avalanche. But I'm sure that more will come online as well.
00:07:15.664 - 00:07:56.602, Speaker A: Okay, so I actually did this. I actually did this poll on my Twitter and on YouTube where I asked, hey, like, what is, what is everyone doing with, what is everyone doing with like their farm tokens, right, on avalanche. And I'm not talking about the Avax token, right? Because Avax tokens does accrue value, right? But what if the farm token and over 50% of people on Twitter. I got almost 1000 votes in a couple hours. But you know they're hodling, right? I don't really know how to interpret this. Is this bullish because there's so much conviction or is this bearish because there's a bunch of people with coins that have like a two, three, four x? Right. So it's up for you to interpret.
00:07:56.602 - 00:08:05.226, Speaker A: Interpret. I'm not really sure. On Twitter. Sorry, on YouTube. Let me refresh this again. So right now this has 564 boats. It's similar sentiment.
00:08:05.226 - 00:08:41.310, Speaker A: Like, everyone's just like saying farm tokens to the moon. I generally agree with the sentiment just because avalanche only has a little over a billion dollars in the ecosystem. And once Aave and curve launches, I'm sure that can go up to 510 15 billion. I'm just like basing this off of what happened on Polygon, right? Because when Aave launched, there was like roughly $10 billion locked in the polygon protocol. And avalanche is actually decentralized. So maybe the market puts a premium on that and maybe the market is more comfortable putting more money into avalanche, right? These are answers that I don't have. I mean, I don't have the answers to these questions, but it's something to consider.
00:08:41.310 - 00:09:05.960, Speaker A: Okay, so I do want to go over Polygon and Solana, right? Just because I feel like people have funds there and just want me to cover them. But obviously curve is a good one, right? You can earn 25% ish on BTCE or stablecoins. With some risk of impermanent loss or, you know, 11% ish on stable coins. Right. On polygon. And also, I do want to touch on Mstable. Right.
00:09:05.960 - 00:09:39.612, Speaker A: Let me connect to the polygon ecosystem here. Maybe you can see here. Now I have to connect 1 second. Okay. So if you essentially deposit your stable coins here, USD to USDC, etcetera, and you can stake it, then you can earn roughly 7% on dollars and paid, and be paid 6% in the MTA token and 8% in the Matic token, right? So I feel like if you're on polygon, I'm less connected to the polygon ecosystem as I used to be. Right. Just because I'm.
00:09:39.612 - 00:10:18.814, Speaker A: I just like, bridged most of my assets to the avalanche ecosystem. But right here you can earn over 20% on stables, which is pretty good, I think, when it comes to Solana, I'm going to talk about the same, I guess, farms that I talked about last week, but I still think sabres is still good. Right, sabre? So these rates used to be like 50%, but they came down a little bit. I mean, 48% on Luna and like 30% on stables and 30% on bitcoin. That's pretty good, right? I mean, if you have assets on Solana, then like the PBTC remBTC pool, like, these are pretty good APIs. And if you're interested, you can just check out, like defi llama, right? Defi llama.com, comma.
00:10:18.814 - 00:10:48.710, Speaker A: Go to Solana and see, like, how many of these protocols have locked up value. Right? So talked about Saber, I'll talk about radium, talk about soul farm and mercurial. So let's go over mercurial. There's just like a curve on Solana, or 27%, right? So it's okay. I think saber is better just from the API perspective, but this is something to look into and then solve form. This is a leveraged yield farming protocol. I'm not too familiar with this, so I'm just highlighting it in this video just to, I guess, you know, give.
00:10:48.710 - 00:11:19.340, Speaker A: Just let people know, like, what's available, as most of you know, like, I don't have any funds in the Solana ecosystem, but, you know, I do know some farms about. Around it. And this is something that you may look into. You can get higher yields, obviously, but you are going to be taking leverage, so that's always the risk. And lastly, radium. Radium always has decent, decent farms. The only thing is that the radium token is like super inflationary, right? So, you know, I think it's generally a token that you do want to farm and dump.
00:11:19.340 - 00:12:26.096, Speaker A: Obviously do your own research, right? If you're super bullish and you have a whole thesis on it, then yeah, maybe you can hold on to it. But think about it. Like, everyone's with all this, like with hundreds of millions of dollars in TVL and everyone's earning, you know, 60% to 100% APY APR, I mean, you know, people are just going to be using this as a revenue source, right? And there are other protocols that will pay you in both. So for example, if you lp for the Cope token and Ray token, you can actually earn both tokens, right? So this is dual gain, I guess. So this is, this, this is like the largest, this is the most liquid exchange on Solana. So I'm sure, I'm sure most of you know about it, but for anyone that was interested, then this is all the opportunities available to you. So terra avalanche polygon, Solana, I think that's like mostly the protocol, mostly the ecosystems that I'm interested in, right? Talked about the celestial and terrestrial season, right? With terra, terra being the moon, Solana being the sun, and terrestrial avalanche being earth, because of the avalanche, I still think that is the case.
00:12:26.096 - 00:12:53.930, Speaker A: I think most of the money will flow into these ecosystems just because no transaction fees are really, really cheap polygon as well. And you know, as much as I love Ethan, like, in the short term, it's not usable. Like, I'm not interested and I just don't want to be paying those gas fees. So yeah, look out for terra. Look out for avalanche. I have a good playlist on the terra ecosystem and I'm starting a playlist for the avalanche ecosystem as well. So there will be a lot of good resources for you to think about.
00:12:53.930 - 00:13:10.700, Speaker A: Which tokens do I farm, which tokens do I buy, how do I farm and dump, etcetera. So, yeah, I covered most of this in my live stream yesterday, so feel free to check. Just please check that out as well. So thank you guys for watching. Hope this video was useful and have fun and be safe farming out there. Bye.
