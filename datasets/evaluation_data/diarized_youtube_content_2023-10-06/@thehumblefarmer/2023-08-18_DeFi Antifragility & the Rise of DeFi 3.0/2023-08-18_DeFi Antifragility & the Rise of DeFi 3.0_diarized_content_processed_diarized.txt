00:00:01.040 - 00:00:31.270, Speaker A: Recently, I got a question from a subscriber asking me if DeFi is dead. With volatility going down across the board, fees have compressed, yields have dried up, and as a result, the fundamentals of some of these DeFi projects are looking a lot worse. And if you want to earn even a sliver of yield, you have to go out the risk curve, risk getting rugged, or play the airdrop game, which is kind of a crapshoot. And I generally agree with this sentiment. I think being in crypto, being in Defi is really, really exhausting right now. It's really hard to remain engaged. It's really hard to be optimistic.
00:00:31.270 - 00:01:25.704, Speaker A: And it got me thinking, and I've been thinking about this for quite some time now, and is Defi dead? And if it is dead, what's it going to take for Defi to come back to greener pastures? And this is what I want this video to be focused on. So feel free to strap in and grab some popcorn. It's going to be a longer video, but I'll have timestamps below so you can navigate through the different sections. So since May 2022 or June 2022, stablecoin Tbl on chain has been flat, meaning that, okay, like, maybe there's enough value for people to not want to bridge out, but people like, we're not really seeing, like, an influx of. Influx of people wanting to bridge capital from off chain to on chain. And until this gets to its previous all time highs, like, I don't really think we can call any pump in the markets a crypto bull market. And I think, like, a real defi bull market only happens once we get above, let's say, 200 billion in market cap and, you know, eventually reach a trillion.
00:01:25.704 - 00:02:15.808, Speaker A: And I think that's why we're all, that's why we're all here in the space, that's why my channel exists, because I truly believe that this can happen. And of course, I know that price went down in the past couple of days, but generally, this is the bitcoin volatility index in blue, and it's been at its all time lows. So prices aren't moving. No one's really using applications. And as a result, what value do these applications have? And if you think about it from a big picture perspective, I think what we learned is that these blockchain native applications have difficulty creating sustainable value because most yields, like sustainable yields in crypto, come from fees. And why do people pay fees? Well, maybe because there's market volatility, maybe because, you know, it creates value. But, you know, if you kind of think about it, like, if you kind of simplify it, it's just money going from one person to another person.
00:02:15.808 - 00:02:50.184, Speaker A: And if there's a lack of capital inflow, then it's like no new value is being created, right? Like, we're not really playing positive sum games. Like, these are zero sum games. And in order for Defi to come back, we need some positive sum game that benefits everybody, that creates value that people actually want to deploy capital on. Another form of yield is inflationary tokenomics. And I think people understand by now that it's not really sustainable. And by definition, it's a fragile system. It's great when money is flowing in because things are going up, but when money is not going in or money is leaving out, you know, everything just looks really, really bad.
00:02:50.184 - 00:03:14.104, Speaker A: And that's where we are now. And, you know, this is the agenda of the video. I'll introduce this concept of Defi, anti fragility and the death of old Defi, and then I'm going to coin a new term. I guess we're at the pa, like, at the phase where taiki is coining new terms now. And I think there's this new Defi 3.0, which I think is how Defi, you know, comes back stronger. So, you know, let's get right into it.
00:03:14.104 - 00:03:44.786, Speaker A: None of financial advice, because I have no idea what I'm talking about. So Defi, anti fragility. So I'm sure you've heard of the term antifragile by now. There's books written about it, but there's, like, three different, I guess, forms of, like, fragility where, you know, like, a system that can suffer or break easily from volatility. And I think Defi is kind of in this camp of fragile and, like, resilient, but it's not truly anti fragile. You can even argue that crypto itself is not anti fragile yet. Of course, it has, you know, survived, like, 15 years.
00:03:44.786 - 00:04:32.100, Speaker A: It survived, like, all these exchanges going bust, like FTX, Luna three AC. But in order for the system to be truly anti fragile, it has to be around for multiple decades, and it has to create value for millions and billions of people. And then, like, until then, I think, you know, we're still in this resilient camp, but, like, how do we get to anti fragile, right? It's. It's gonna be hard. Like, how does the system get, like, grow and, like, get strong for volatility from all the shocks that it's experienced? And, you know, that's kind of the theme around this video, because in its current form, I think we learned that DeFi can't survive these high interest rates and or lower volatility environment. And as a result, the entire system is fragile to the lack of stablecoin demand. The fed started raising rates march of 2022, and ever since then, tvo down.
00:04:32.100 - 00:05:22.306, Speaker A: And I think, I mean, I've written about this many, many times, and I feel really strongly about this, but I think that until on chain yields that are perceived very safe can offer higher yields, higher yields than the risk free rate, we can't have a sustained defi bull market. I think this is the prerequisite to a Defi bull market. It's not meme coin swapping, bringing retail back in. No. I think what needs to happen first is for stablecoin yields to go up across the board, enticing more and more capital to remain in the ecosystem and come into the ecosystem, and then we can play, like, on new projects, new tokens, because there's more, I guess, money within the ecosystem that people can make money out of, I suppose. And if you go a step further, I think that DeFi needs its own risk free rate. We don't need 15% stablecoin yields that go down in two weeks.
00:05:22.306 - 00:05:45.868, Speaker A: No, we need 10% yields that stay flat for five years. That sounds insane. That really sounds insane. But I think there is a path to get there. And this is how DeFi becomes anti fragile and kind of repeating same points. We need to keep stablecoin liquidity sticky, have stablecoin inflows, exceed outflows. And it's not going to be meme coins.
00:05:45.868 - 00:06:08.220, Speaker A: It's to create better products that incentivize people to encourage this behavior. We can't just tell people to remain in crypto because it's going to pump again with having. We can't say that meme coins are going to create billionaires. No, like, we need to create, like, better products. And this is where the rise of DeFi 3.0 comes in. Right? Like, how do we create better products? And.
00:06:08.220 - 00:06:46.388, Speaker A: Yeah, so I argue that, you know, Defi 3.0, it's not because. Right. I mean, of course, like, when there's market volatility and, like, printing new tokens and people buying it, you know, it can work, right? People can make money like yada, yada, yada, it kind of works. But to make it a truly, like, anti fragile system, we need a system where it doesn't rely on new tokens, it doesn't really market volatility and it doesn't rely on like interest rates going down. And it's all about creating sustainable sources of yield that's you know, separate from crypto native forces. And you know, whether, you know, like what, whatever's happening in the world, we just like need stable like yield sources that people can rely on.
00:06:46.388 - 00:07:23.678, Speaker A: And this is like where DeFi 3.0 comes in. So DeFi 3.0, it's a system that can survive periods of high and low market volatility, high and low interest rates, and also risk on and risk off periods. Okay? Like, I mean this is Trashfi, I argue is anti fragile. And you know, Defi needs to get closer to trashfi and even offer better products than tradfi, right? That's anti fragility, you know, stablecoin, Tvl flat. And you know, I've been talking about this concept of real world assets and tokenized treasuries and, and the entire idea and the entire thesis and the theme of my idea, DeFi 3.0,
00:07:23.678 - 00:07:48.550, Speaker A: is that crypto innovative applications can't create value within its own ecosystem. It's just like, it's not good enough. It's just not good enough. We need to be real with ourselves. It's not good enough. So if that's the current result, if that's the meta, then I think we need to import it from external sources so off chain yields to feed the on chain economy and that can in fact create value. Okay, that's kind of the idea.
00:07:48.550 - 00:08:38.990, Speaker A: So before I get into the concepts and the projects and the tokens, I want to give a quick disclaimer and just say that I think of DeFi 3.0 as a framework. I've been talking about certain projects like Makerdao, but I view Maker as a vehicle for DeFi 3.0 as the best, I guess, liquid token to like bet on that narrative for now. But I mean the goal of this video is I also want this video to be anti fragile, right? I want this video to be like seen by people six months for now and you know, think about and like onboard more people to like, you know, buy into this new idea we know six months from now. Like maybe Maker is like less relevant, right? And maybe there's like a new project that's like doing better. So you know, don't focus too, too much on like the individual projects.
00:08:38.990 - 00:09:16.512, Speaker A: I'm going to talk about them because I mean there's like nothing else to talk about. And there are steps being taken to you know, create better products that I've talked about, but you know, for me personally, I think of it as a framework and in the coming months, even coming years, I'm going to frame like my investing and farming strategies around this framework. Yeah. And you know, for example, like there's this new protocol called t protocol that I think is pretty interesting. You can participate in the testnet campaign, maybe get some airdrops and participate. I mean I might participate in the idea depending on the valuation. It's also like a tokenized TVO project.
00:09:16.512 - 00:10:09.628, Speaker A: So you know, I'll talk about Maker a lot because I'm going to get a bunch of questions and I've talked about it before and I hold maker for these reasons and you can also agree with this idea and, but like disagree with the idea that maker is a good hold. Right. So I don't want to like focus too much on the token price and like the token like itself, but you know, just giving a general disclaimer here, but I do like maker and I'll talk about it. So like real world assets, there's a growing trend of projects that's you know, buying t bills off chain, tokenizing it, and bringing that yield on chain. And of course if you're like a us customer, like maybe that doesn't create that much value because you can go to fidelity. But I think the permissionless nature of blockchains and giving anyone access to, you know, dollars and the risk rate, I think that's a pretty good value add. And I think adding financial engineering on top can even make for, you know, better types of like products.
00:10:09.628 - 00:10:44.026, Speaker A: Like for example, right, like right now this is maker Dao. You can stake dai to earn 8%. This is gonna go down to 5% on Monday, I believe, or Tuesday. And like most people, it's, I mean it's like most people are like, you know, it's like Justin sun depositing like 100 million daidem Olympus dow. I mean there's like a raft, I mean yeah, it's like mostly like whales participating in this, but you know, like imagine like 8% yield on dollars sustainable. I'm sure like that's gonna bring more capital on chain, right? I'm sure that's gonna bring, or that's gonna, you know, keep stable coin liquidity stickier. And right now this isn't purely sustainable.
00:10:44.026 - 00:11:17.936, Speaker A: But I do think that, you know, there, or I'll go through the ways on in which like where this, these rates can be sustainable and yeah, I'll talk you through it with the DAi savings rate going up from 3.5% to 8%, and it's gonna go down 5%. But I still think the DAi supply is gonna keep growing. In the past couple of weeks, the TvL, sorry, the market cap of DAi has gone up by a billion dollars. And like I mentioned, there's a new proposal. I think it's gonna pass Monday, and it's gonna lower the TSR to 5%. So in the future, you can stake Dai and earn 5%.
00:11:17.936 - 00:11:45.680, Speaker A: And if you think about it, this is now the risk free rate of defi. Because I think by now, people generally trust the peg of Dai. It's been around over five years, and it's. I mean, it's had its problems here and there, but I think, you know, you know, like, earning 5% on Dai, like, you know, a fixed rate on Dai, I think that's a pretty good proposition. And I think, right. Whether you like it or not, this is currently the risk free rate of defi and maker for now. For now, right.
00:11:45.680 - 00:12:16.540, Speaker A: It's the on chain Federal Reserve, okay? Like, if you're a defi project and you can't offer, like, a stable coin yield of 5%, no one is gonna, like, deposit money into your protocol, right? There's like, no way. And the token is gonna go to zero. It's kind of like stake deeds, right? If you can earn, like, four or 5%, like, staking eth, then, like, why would you deposit money into, like, some random defi protocol that's paying 3%, right? It makes no sense. So it kind of raises the bar for defi rates across the board. And it naturally brings you to up to. Right. Because if you can, for example, borrow USDC at 4%, then, you know, you can swap it to dai or in 5%.
00:12:16.540 - 00:12:29.516, Speaker A: And that's like a. Like a relatively risk free arbitrage. So it's gonna bring lending rates up. And generally the yield on chain should go higher. And I know what you're thinking, right? 5% is not good enough. Right. I can earn 5.3%
00:12:29.516 - 00:12:43.074, Speaker A: on fidelity. You're stupid. I agree. Right? I mean, I personally own some t bills myself. Okay. Like, for sure. But let's talk about how do we create a superior product, right? Because we need to be trash by.
00:12:43.074 - 00:13:05.618, Speaker A: Okay. Like, Defi needs to be trash by. Otherwise, people aren't gonna, you know, like, put millions of dollars and billions of dollars into this. And I think that, you know, with defi money, Legos, incomposible smart contracts through defi blue chips and, like, applications, people trust. Right? Like, not like new stuff. I think, you know, you can actually create value on top of the risk free rate and then create demand and value. So there's this new proposal on AAvE forums that's.
00:13:05.618 - 00:13:39.640, Speaker A: That should go live on the 19th. It's going to pass. I'm, like, 95% sure it's going to pass, and it's to onboard SDAI as collateral. So SDAI is staked dai. That's earning 5%, and it's a liquid derivative of staked dai, and the loan to value ratio is 77%, and the liquidation threshold is 80%. And then right now, Aave has its own stable coin called go, where you can borrow it at a fixed rate of 1.5%. So LTV of 77% loan to value means that if you deposit $10,000, then you can borrow up to $7,700 worth of value.
00:13:39.640 - 00:14:09.594, Speaker A: And given the liquidation threshold is 80%, you only get liquidated if SDI value falls to 9625. So this is 7700 divided by 0.8, right? That's how I get the math. But SDI is literally staked die, right? Like, it's backed by die, right. So I don't really see this happening, I think. I'm not saying that you should borrow, you know, like. Like, that's 2d gen, because, you know, there could be, like, some wonky things happening, but that's generally, like, what it means, right? This proposal.
00:14:09.594 - 00:14:42.810, Speaker A: And it can create these looping strategies that, you know, can offer, you know, ten to 20% rates if you want it to. So if you loop it once, as in, let's say you start with $10,000, you borrow $6,000 worth of go at 1.5%, and then swap it for steak die at 5%. Right. Then you have $15,000 worth of state die with $6,000 worth of debt, and your entire position is yielding 7.1%. Right? So, like, that's one loop, right? If you do that once, if you do it twice, you get 9.2%, and then each incremental loop increases the APR by 2.1%.
00:14:42.810 - 00:15:10.774, Speaker A: And then if you do it eight times, you get. You can get, like, 20% again. I'm not saying you should do this, right? I'm just, like, saying it's possible this is going to be super gas intensive. But I'm sure that if these strategies start to become bigger and bigger, there's going to be new front ends to enable this with one click. And, you know, like, if. I mean, like, let's say you live it five times and you're earning 15% on dollars, right? On Segdai, that's pretty good, right? And it's not coming from inflationary token, like mechanics. It's not coming from like ponsonomics.
00:15:10.774 - 00:15:33.798, Speaker A: No, it's coming from tokenized t bills. It's coming from the risk free rate. And whenever these t bills mature, the capital flows back on chain and it's creating value. And you know, if you want to mimic it, right, 69%, you can get these rates. But I mean, yeah, I don't know why I included that. I guess I'm still pretty immature. So in terms of economic value, right, like Avi makes money, right? They make 1.5%
00:15:33.798 - 00:16:13.972, Speaker A: on the borrow, right. The go stable and borrow maker makes money because they get to clip, like whatever the difference rate difference between like 5% and the risk free rate. And if not all staked, or if not all Dai is staked, then like not all, like the dollar, not all Dai is like being utilized. And like, you know, like the differential utilization rate means more like profits. I mean, that's kind of complex, I suppose. And also like the end user makes money, right? Like, I mean, like I would do this, right? Like if I make a bunch of money trading altcoins, which is very, very hard, then maybe I'm gonna loop it five times and earn like 15% and then just go to bed and come back in like a month and you know, like buy eat with it or something. I have no idea.
00:16:13.972 - 00:16:48.736, Speaker A: Right? Basically, right? It creates value, right? It creates value. And in the past, like the counterparty, if you think about DeFi, like old DeFi, DeFi 1.0, the counterparty was like other crypto participants, like paying fees to use applications, but it's not really creating value. Or token holders. If you're printing new tokens, then the counterparty is basically token holders because I'm dumping your token to realize that yield. But in this case, the counterparty is the us government interest payments. People are willing to pay aave money to borrow.
00:16:48.736 - 00:17:43.829, Speaker A: People are willing to use maker to use the state type product because I mean, the money is flowing from off chain sources to on chain sources. So all these protocols are making money, including the user, and it's creating value. These are positive sum games, and I think these types of products are needed. And of course, when this first launches, it's not going to be liquid, it's not going to be amazing. But I'm going to assume that SDI is going to be liquid on l two s at some point, all money markets are going to integrate it, because due to competition, and I think it's going to make for better and better products and hopefully maybe in the future, base chain, the Coinbase L two can offer one click leverage that has disclaimers that give people a 10% yield. And they say SDI earning this, you borrow at this rate through Coinbase lend or whatever, you kind of get what I'm going for. Right.
00:17:43.829 - 00:17:59.034, Speaker A: Um. Right, so, summary, defi 1.0 fees come from other crypto people with, like, you know, like, with different steps. But DeFi 3.0 fees come. Fees come from other crypto people and external yield sources, right? Because DeFi 3.0, it contains DeFi 1.0.
00:17:59.034 - 00:18:24.922, Speaker A: It's just introducing a new mechanic around tokenized t bills. And I argue that if people are making more money on chain, then, you know, like, maybe they're going to spend that money elsewhere, and then other DeFi protocols can benefit as a result. Okay, so that's kind of the idea. And like I mentioned, right, the go, it's under peg. It's like $20 million mark cap. It's not liquid, but I mean, obviously a blue chip. I think we'll get to, like, a multi billion dollar stable coin, like, market at some point anyways, so it's not like a.
00:18:24.922 - 00:18:38.650, Speaker A: Like, this video isn't like, oh, my God, like, buy everything. It's gonna pump, like, oh, like, oh, my God, like, we're so rich. No, no, no. It's. It's to understand where Defi is going, right. And to introduce this concept of Defi 3.0 and how I think this is, like, what makes Defi antifragile.
00:18:38.650 - 00:19:17.906, Speaker A: I mean, there's even, like, one click looping products already, right? I mean, I don't want to give people PTSD, but the mechanic here wasn't flawed. Right? I mean, you use interest bearing stable coins as collateral. You borrow stable coin and you loop it. Right? I guess, like, the collateral, like, this time around was not. Was very fragile, right? But if you replace this with SDAI, then, I mean, yeah, that works. And Mim is $50 million marking app, so it's like more liquid, but, like, maybe people aren't comfortable with it because of all the drama. There's other real world asset issuers like fracs, right? They're going to introduce Frax V three, which is like tokenized evils.
00:19:17.906 - 00:19:38.350, Speaker A: They're going to integrate, or they incorporated a Delaware C Corp as part of their fracs v three update. I have no idea when it's coming. I heard it's going to be this month, maybe it's next, I have no idea. But you know, like they're closely tied to curve. And then curve finance. They recently introduced this one click leverage. So it's similar to that average product.
00:19:38.350 - 00:20:16.272, Speaker A: But curve CRV USD is at $100 million mark cap, so it's pretty liquid. And you can borrow CRV USD, buy an asset and do the looping strategies I talked about. So we're kind of seeing the base foundations being built. And maybe this is less interesting, but just think about it. Maybe in a few months, all these systems are more liquid, people are using it, and then people can create products on top of that. And maybe, who knows? Maybe there's a super stake to die six months from now that's earning 10%. And you can LP super stake dai with stake deed, that's earning 5%.
00:20:16.272 - 00:20:32.228, Speaker A: And then you're LP earning fees and the underlying assets are also appreciating. It's like, whoa, that's passive income. Oh my God. We'll have people making tiktoks about it. Um, and we'll talk about, who knows that. Okay. Like maybe we're too early, right? But uh, that, that's kind, that's kind of the idea.
00:20:32.228 - 00:21:14.412, Speaker A: Um, and you know, going back to like maker, right. Um, I like these stable coin issues right now because, you know, if you think about like the fragility of the current system and the anti fragility of the new system, um, it's kind of dependent on the stable coin issuers because they thrive in a high interest rate environment. And you know, these defi projects, there's questions around regulations and whatnot, but they always deliver value back too. It's token orders. Unlike c five, for example, tether. Whenever you buy tether, or use tether on centralized exchanges, you as a user get 0% rates. But tether, they take the backing, buy tables, and they make a billion dollars every single quarter.
00:21:14.412 - 00:22:10.382, Speaker A: It's ridiculous. They're one of the most profitable companies in the world. Like, why wouldn't, why don't we ask for, why don't we better, sorry. Why don't we ask for this? Why don't we ask tether, give me some of that yield. But as long as people use tether and don't complain, they're going to keep doing this. And maybe this is too utopian in my way of thinking, but I tend to be optimistic by nature. If dai right stakedai offers like 5% yield like the base steak Dai, then if you think about it, they're kind of like, looking to like, vampire attack USDC and maybe tether, but like, mostly USDC because they, like, they don't give any yield back because you can mint dai with USDC, right? And if, like, when you do that, like what? Like, what does maker do? They convert or they redeem USDC into dollars in the backend and then with those dollars they buy t bills.
00:22:10.382 - 00:22:57.226, Speaker A: Okay, so, like, it's kind of like vampire attacking USDC market cap because it's increasing the amount of redemptions. USDC marking app is going down regardless for, like, many reasons. But it's kind of similar to, like, the stake deed argument of, like, why hold naked ether when I can hold stake deed? Why hold USDT when I can hold stake die? And I think this is the question that I think people need to start asking more. And, you know, like, not everyone is gonna stake, like, their stable coin into SDI, right? Similar to how not everyone that holds eth wants to stake it for, like, like, staked Eth for various reasons. But I think this is, like, a slow trend that I think will come to fruition in the coming months. I don't want to keep saying good things about maker. I do want to highlight its flaws and the risks.
00:22:57.226 - 00:23:32.296, Speaker A: For example, like, they buy tivos through, like, off chain entities. That's not, like, managed by, like, the DAO itself. So when it comes to transparency and reporting, it's like, really flawed and it's impossible to know how much money these entities are holding, like, in real time, right? Like, it's not really on chain, it's like off chain. This real world asset report for June came out, like the end, like end of July. And I read through this and it's like, not really, really clear, right? It kind of sucks. And, like, I guess, like, you know, maybe I do. So the yellow line is the diamark gap.
00:23:32.296 - 00:23:57.026, Speaker A: And like, this is like, the maker price. I do expect the Dai mark cap to eventually surpass its previous ultima, which was $10 billion. I really don't see why it couldn't. And maybe it's a good barometer of maker strength because in 2020 and 2021, Dai went up and then price went up. But I guess Dai peaked in early 2022 when Maker was already nuking. But maybe back then, Maker didn't really have value. Cruel.
00:23:57.026 - 00:24:35.162, Speaker A: And now they have these buybacks that actually accrue value to token holders. So, like, maybe that can change, but it's not like a perfect token, right? And I think maker is viewed as, like, the poster child of, like, bad DeFi tokens. So like maybe like I'm like just like not, I'm like super incorrect in like my way of thinking. But I still think that if you look at the underlying fundamentals of maker, I still think that, you know, it is like a good play for DeFi 3.0. And you know, I still choose to allocate and hold onto this token. And there's this new governance proposal. So this is pretty big.
00:24:35.162 - 00:25:24.422, Speaker A: I think it's going to go live probably on Monday. And the TLDr is that right now? Sorry. Yeah, so I'll talk about the different elements of this proposal, but right now, every 30 minutes the protocol is buying back $5,000 worth of MKRD and they're pairing that with $5,000 worth of Dai. So with that $10,000 position, they put it into a uniswap v two lp position. And in the past couple of weeks it purchased like $7 million with a maker, paired it with liquidity. And they have their own protocol on liquidity. And one of the proposals is to basically, instead of every 30 minutes, let's do it every 2 hours and then increase the size from five thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars.
00:25:24.422 - 00:25:47.270, Speaker A: So like nothing's really changing, right. So instead of buying $5,000 every 30 minutes, you're buying $20,000 every 2 hours. I mean like the dollar value is the same. I mean, maybe this is kind of cool. I guess it's like bigger numbers. Maybe people like that there's, that there's also, I guess like fear and like FUD around. I guess like the estimate of annual profits.
00:25:47.270 - 00:26:26.352, Speaker A: Because when I first made my maker video, I think this was like 80 million and now it's 8 million and it's like, wow, like the P ratio is so bad, right? And it's making no money. But I also think that this isn't like the right way to think about it because this is only, I mean, this is like an estimate, right? And it seems that the DSR, the die savings rate is going to be at 8%. But we know that this is only like, this was like a marketing like tool for like the Makerdao team to like just go like turn this online for two weeks to just grow the market cap of DAi, right? I mean it went up by a billion and now it's going to lower it to 5%. And if you just. Okay, so right now the, the amount of DAI in the DSR is 1.42 billion. Let's just round up 1.5
00:26:26.352 - 00:26:48.646, Speaker A: billion. The cost of the protocol at 8% is 120 million, cost of 5%, 25 million. So when, like on Monday, the estimate profits should go up by like roughly $45 million. Right. So, you know, like, no, like this, this changes. And I, and I still think that this is going to go up over time. And I guess another fear of concern, a point of concern is the system surplus.
00:26:48.646 - 00:27:35.012, Speaker A: So the system only buys back maker when the system surplus is above $50 million. So if the surplus right now is 54, then, you know, like, the protocol itself only has $2 million worth of bypassure for its own token. But I do expect this number to go up. And this is like the flaw maker too, where if you go to like, the real world asset report for June, this column here is 23 million. So this is like, how much interest, like, revenue that these off chain entities have generated that has yet to, I guess, be added back to the protocol. And we have no idea, like when, like, where this money is, when this is going to be distributed on chain and, yeah, like, it's not like a perfect system. So can this really scale? I have no idea.
00:27:35.012 - 00:28:09.944, Speaker A: But, like, maybe like, this is how it starts and then it, like, becomes more efficient over time. So at some point, this is going to be, this, this is going to be added back to here, which is going to result in eleven and a half million dollars with a buy pressure. Right. For the maker token. And also there's this block tower, Andromeda vault that can allocate up to $1.2 billion with the treasuries, and they've only allocated 600 million, so they can allocate like $600 million more. And if they do so it's going to increase, um, the, like, expected, um, revenues by $27 million.
00:28:09.944 - 00:28:46.128, Speaker A: Right? So, um, when, once the DSR goes down to 5%, it's going to increase the profit estimate by 45 million. And then once block tower, uh, deploys capital, it's going to also go by 27 million. So, um, I mean, like, the thing is, like, like I said, like, I have no idea when they're going to deploy this. Um, it's up to them. Right. Um, and this is like one of the flaws because, I mean, like, who are these people? And like, maybe they don't have, like, the best interests for maker at hand, but like I mentioned, right, like, defi 3.0 as a framework, I think maker is like the best tool to bet on that right now, but it doesn't mean that in six months it's still going to be like the best token to hold, right? I'm going to keep it fluid, right.
00:28:46.128 - 00:29:31.090, Speaker A: I'm going to just monitor it like week by week, keep really close eyes on it. But I still like this token. So I think reasons for the correction, of course, the market nuked recently, but, you know, estimated profits down, system surplus down. Maybe people don't think about it that much and it's like, oh, like that token. But I think all three are just noise. And I think the bigger thing to focus on or that I'm focusing on is okay. Like if like the recovery of TFI is gonna be led by tokenized TVL projects and maker is leading that charge, then for now I'll allocate here and then maybe in a few months, like some things will change and then I'll re evaluate my positioning at that point, right? Like I'm like really digging deep into real world asset protocols because I think that's where most of the value is going to be.
00:29:31.090 - 00:30:00.958, Speaker A: That's where most of the values go lie at least, you know, in the short to medium term. And this is rare for me to say, but generally, like, I haven't been a fan of like the maker doubt governance model and I'm still like not a fan. Right. I talked about how imperfect it is. And this is Ruhn, the founder of Maker and Ruin also, right. You know, people have mixed feelings about him. But I do agree because, yes, like, you know, increasing, like the Dai savings rate is not going to be good for profitability.
00:30:00.958 - 00:30:49.394, Speaker A: It's not going to be good for token buybacks. Like, you know, like token holders want buybacks now, right? But I also think that's like a short term, like a short mind, like short term mindset. And I think it's bigger to like think longer term, right? Because the ultimate goal is for Dai to like vampire attack USDC and tethere and to grow to like $100 billion die in the next three years. I'm not saying it's like, I'm not saying it's gonna happen, but I mean, this is like what ruin's going for. And you know, he recently like bought back a bunch of tokens. He's on like this benevolent dictator arc and you know, like I kind of agree with what he's going for because right now growth is king, right? I do think that makers should focus on growing the DAI supply and you know, instead of focusing on short term profits, let's grow the project and then focus on profits later. I do agree.
00:30:49.394 - 00:31:20.316, Speaker A: Right? And then focus on like, you know, network effects, economies of scale. Like that definitely makes sense. So another element of the proposal that I talked about is to increase the borrow rate, because right now you can borrow Dai for like 3.5% and then stake it in the DSR for 5%, right? Like, I mean, that's like bleeding value in the ecosystem. And this new proposal, right, is gonna. That I talked about is gonna increase the Dai borrow rate to 5%. So there's like no more risk free, like arbitrage.
00:31:20.316 - 00:32:15.576, Speaker A: But if you borrow Dai using like makerdao like application called Spark, Rune is basically promising them like a retroactive airdrop of this, of the spark token. So technically you can use stake de discolor or borrow die stake dai, and like, make no money from like the stable coin rate, but you will be earning free spark tokens for helping out the protocol or increasing usage. So maybe it's going to create adoption and who knows? I have no idea what it's going to do, but I would think that this would be value additive, at least to the diet market cap. I kind of want to summarize Rune's form rant because there's like. Yeah, I mean, Roon talks about a bunch of things in these forums. It's a lot, right? His head is everywhere. Yeah, I mean, he's like a founder, right? But, you know, ultimately he wants 10 billion market by end of year, 100 billion post endgame, which we'll talk about.
00:32:15.576 - 00:32:48.998, Speaker A: Buybacks are great, but let's focus on growth and then use like the five, like 8%, 5% DSR to get more estai integrations. And, you know, let's grow economies of scale and network effects similar to how, you know, with lido and stake deed. Stake deed doesn't offer the best yields, but people still choose to hold it because it's the most liquid and people trust it. So I think that's kind of what ruin is going for. And it wants to be like the lido of stablecoins, basically. Right? And I actually agree with this vision. For now, his endgame vision is kind of murky.
00:32:48.998 - 00:33:10.950, Speaker A: I have mixed feelings about it. But for now. So let's talk about Endgame. It's a pretty interesting thing that they're going for, but TLDR there's going to be six subdao tokens under Makerdao. So with governance, right, there's Makerdao and there's like six subdivisions that add value back to. It's like this pyramid, I suppose, right? Again, like, maybe that's a word. Bad word.
00:33:10.950 - 00:33:56.736, Speaker A: It's a triangle, right? It's a triangle. So there's a six of those under maker, and they're all going to have tokens. And the only way to farm these tokens is going to be through a fair farming distribution system where you have to stake maker or dai and or dai to earn these tokens. So basically, right, whenever this thing comes out, end of this year, early next year, you can stake these tokens to earn more tokens. Spark is an aave fork, and it has the most usage right now. I have no idea, like, what it's gonna be valued at, but, you know, he talked about this in one of his threads. You can borrow dai to retroactively farm to airdrop, and then once this token is liquid, you can also farm it by staking maker.
00:33:56.736 - 00:34:24.320, Speaker A: So I guess it's more incentives to hold and stake these tokens because you're getting additional yield. This is just one example. It can only farm these tokens. With these two tokens, subdao emissions will lower DSR costs. For example, if you can stake Dai to earn 10% in SPK, then technically they can lower the DSR to like maybe 2%. And then, you know, like, that's going to increase to maker profitability, which will result in more buybacks. So that's kind of cool.
00:34:24.320 - 00:35:10.840, Speaker A: And also the, with Endgame, they're going to rebrand maker and die, which I disagree with. But, you know, I mean, like, rune, like, he spends his entire life. I mean, this is like his life's work, right? And if he thinks it's like the best decision, I mean, only time will tell, right, people? I mean, yeah, like, there's like this, like, I think crypto, like, in general, like, people, like, just criticize founders and like, call them bad people. And sure some founders are bad people, but, you know, like, we need these founders. Like, we need to support them and we need to like, you know, let them like innovate and experiment and maybe, you know, I mean, if it's bad, like, maybe you're like, maybe, like, maker and die dies or make maybe. Who knows? Like, maybe it really helps with like, tradfi adoption later on. Who knows? I have no idea.
00:35:10.840 - 00:35:47.130, Speaker A: And, like, before I get in. Yeah. So as we wrap up, you know, like, I do share like, free research reports on HFA research and feel free to, like, you know, follow. There's a free newsletter, link will be in the description below. I also created a new telegram channel if you want to ask me questions, because crypto moves so fast, it's really hard for me to, like, make videos all the time thinking, like, talking like following up on like things I've said like two months ago, three months ago. It's really hard for me to just give general updates. So if you want to ask me questions, you can tag me here.
00:35:47.130 - 00:36:22.210, Speaker A: I can't guarantee I'll respond because I get spammed so often, but link will be in the description below. And also, if you want these research reports in real time weekly videos, feel free to check out the premium discord humble format research you don't have to join at this point in the cycle. The current iteration of DeFi, this is more like a therapy session. We're all like oh my God, what's going on? But feel free to check it out. You don't have to sign up, but just putting it out there. I don't run ads and stuff. So anyways, wrapping it up.
00:36:22.210 - 00:36:58.828, Speaker A: Summary in terms of where we are now and where we're going to go, DeFi 1.0 it started DeFi boom in 2020 with the compound liquidity mining campaign. Um, you know like inflation, tokenomics, like encouraging certain types of behavior that worked, um, but it died when, you know, fed started raising interest rates. Um, and people started to like sell their bitcoin and ether. Um, and then near the end of like the peak, like peak bull market, we had DeFi 2.0. And like all these projects basically died, right? This is like just peak bull market phenomena where people were like to see fork. Um, and I don't even think DeFi 2.0
00:36:58.828 - 00:37:37.260, Speaker A: should be like a term, but I guess, you know, it's cemented in like the, in like the history books by now, right? So I guess like the new era of DeFi. And this is like what the term I'm coining, right, DeFi 3.0. And I think the beginning of DeFi 3.0 happens when DeFi becomes anti fragile via real world assets. And I think we're going to start, or this movement is going to first start with a tokenization to t bills because t bills, or if you nice, if you tokenize t bills, they're fungible. So you know, you can integrate it with like different types of protocols. There's going to be like, I'm sure there's going to be like big real estate projects in the future, but that's kind of hard to integrate because they're non fungible.
00:37:37.260 - 00:38:17.974, Speaker A: There's like stocks, but there's like regulation issues, I suppose, and it's like less liquid and like what's the value of trading stocks on chain, right? At least with tokenized tpls, you can, like, you know, introduce like, new types of strategies. But I do think that, you know, the next phase of DeFi and, like, the next bull market is going to be led with the tokenization of securities. And with DeFi 3.0, we bridge, like, off chain entertainments to on chain, right? And then this way, DeFi is able to create positive sum games where economic activity and value is generated from real world assets. Because DeFi 1.0, the yield and fees come from other people. But DeFi 3.0,
00:38:17.974 - 00:38:56.024, Speaker A: the yield comes from other people and also external sources. That's very reliable. Right? The risk free rate from treasuries are the most reliable sources of yield out there. So to bring that on chain and add financial engineering on top, I think can catalyze the beginning of the next bull market. And then who knows? Maybe there's gonna be amazing new projects that come out or get launched as a result. But this is generally my idea. Even, like, Blackrock Slayer Fink, you know, he thinks that the tokenization of securities is gonna be like the next generation of markets.
00:38:56.024 - 00:39:28.816, Speaker A: So, you know, if DeFi were to get to, like a trillion dollars in TVL, it's not gonna just come from retail. We need stratify participation. Are they gonna be buying meme coins? Like, I don't really think so. Right? Like, they're probably gonna be, like, just deploying dollars into, like, tokenized t bills and maybe, like, you know, offering, like, more transparent reporting for their share. I mean, who knows, right? I have no idea what, like, what these stratified people have in mind, but I think your real world assets are going to become like the Trojan horse that begin the great capital migration from tradfi to Defi. Right? So real world assets is Trojan Horse. Defi takeover in the middle.
00:39:28.816 - 00:39:54.410, Speaker A: Crypto promotes crypto talks about, like, oh, my God, like, look at that. Traffic is like, oh, it's so good. It's so smart. Wow. Wow. You know, like, I'm bullish, right? Who knows? I have no idea. Who knows? But, you know, and so wrapping it up, this is something I want to talk about, because I kind of get the sentiment from people online that the bitcoin halving is going to cause a pump, because it's caused pumps before.
00:39:54.410 - 00:40:29.820, Speaker A: And I think it's more likely to happen than not. But I think if you just view that statement, that's hopium. We're just hoping that the halving leads to prices pumping. Of course, like, the disinflationary supply of the coin does matter, but it's gonna have less and less of an effect over time. And at some point, until blockchains can create real value for real people, we're not gonna see DeFi or cryptos get big. So I even argue that DeFi 3.0 has to happen for crypto to even experience a bull run.
00:40:29.820 - 00:40:57.484, Speaker A: There's also this hopium around meme coins. It's like, oh, retail comes back when meme coins start pumping. And I mean, I'm sure, like, sure, right. It's like, some people, like, love meme coins and, like, that's all they care about. But that's. I feel like that's also a very condescending way to, like, view, like, retail and, like, people in general, like, like, basically we're all retail, right? Like, like, I don't, like, invest in angel rounds. Like, I don't, you know, like, get paid money.
00:40:57.484 - 00:42:17.108, Speaker A: Like, I don't really have, like, inside information, right? I'm like, just out here, like, just grinding away, looking for any sources of value on this blockchain, like, similar to you, right? And I think it's more likely that these new types of defi products onboard more people instead of meme coins, because meme coins only target a specific type of psychographic of a person. And I think most people, they want to, like, invest in things that they see value in. And right now, there's not much, you know, like, unfortunately, there's, like, not much of value in crypto, right? I think there are slivers of value, right? And, you know, like, I'm, like, allocating capital and, you know, like, in the Defi 3.0 is a framework, right? So I'm like, okay, I have this framework and I'm going to invest accordingly, farm accordingly, because, you know, if new tokens launch, new products launch, there's only farming opportunities. I'll farm that instead of, like, some random Dex fork on Coinbase l two. Like what? Like what? Right? So I don't know. Like, I feel like, you know, instead of relying on hopium around having and, like, meme coin swamping and, like, you know, using those people exit liquidity.
00:42:17.108 - 00:42:55.800, Speaker A: You know, like, let's build better product like products, right? And, like, use the government interest payments as, like, exit liquidity, right? Like, imagine, like, you know, we're staking stable coins. We're like, we're like, dumping the yield, right, to, like, buy stuff, right? We're like, dumping the government payments for income, right? It's like maker is using the government interest payments like, buy back its token, right? It's like, let's use the government as liquidity. I don't know. I mean, people, people get upset by, like, that lingo. It's like, oh, like, you know, government is like bridging money on chain, like buying our bags, but it's a meme. Right? Like, don't take it too seriously. The point is, right, like defi three by, like, real value, right.
00:42:55.800 - 00:43:19.746, Speaker A: Real value. Instead of money going from one person to another, let's have, like, more ways to generate value and. Yeah, I think that's. Oh, yeah. So lastly, I'll talk about regulation risk. And as we wrap it up, of course, you know how legal are tokenized bills, right? It's like, not Kyc. Yeah, but you know, like, how legal is, like, most of crypto, really.
00:43:19.746 - 00:44:27.482, Speaker A: And I think when it comes to companies and projects to enter people's headspace mindshare to actually gain adoption. I kind of think of the uber example, because when Uber first launched, they didn't ask the government for permission. They just started signing up drivers. And at some point there were so many drivers that the government couldn't really say no to Uber because it was a, like, the livelihood of so many people. And maybe that's not a great analogy because I guess Uber drivers actually make a living and stuff. And maybe t bills, maybe it's cool, but maybe it's. Who knows? Basically what I'm saying is that I think it's more important for crypto projects focus on growth and then just create such a good product that if the regulators want to step in and say no, the regulators have to be like, well, if we do XYZ, then it's going to damage the markets too much.
00:44:27.482 - 00:44:52.800, Speaker A: It's not going to be great. So instead of shutting down this project, we'll make new regulation or new legislation that says maker. Your current model is not good. If you want to continue operating, go through ABC. Right. And then maker is like, okay, I'm so sorry. And then they go, they go through these additional steps.
00:44:52.800 - 00:45:26.370, Speaker A: It might not be like a clean transition, but I think generally, if you're in crypto, if you're just worried about regulation all the time, I think it's really, really hard to just remain interested. Maybe this is a bad take, but it's, I mean, it's my take, right? It's my video. It's my channel, so you're gonna get my take. And like I mentioned, right? Like I mentioned near the beginning, DeFi 3.0 as a framework. Don't focus too much on, like, the make, like, the maker token itself. Just think of that as, like, how I'm perceiving the markets right now.
00:45:26.370 - 00:45:52.118, Speaker A: I think, you know, I've come to the conclusion that going back to this first, how many slides is this? 77. Okay, something slides. That's a lot of slides. Going back to this original question around, you know, doesn't defy seem kind of dead right now? You know, if you think or. For me, I thought about. I mean, I. Yeah, like, I think about this way too much, but, you know, if I.
00:45:52.118 - 00:46:15.470, Speaker A: If I think about this, like. Like, in a more fundamental reason or fundamental manner, it's like, okay, like, yeah, like, it's. If you think about it, it's not. It's nothing. It's not an anti fragile system. And then I thought about, okay, like, how do we get to anti fragility? Well, like, the reason defi is fragile is because the risk free rate is too damn high. So I think for Defi to be anti fragile, we need to bring the risk free rate on chain.
00:46:15.470 - 00:46:45.080, Speaker A: And then, you know, if interest rates remain high, then Defi can compete. If fed cuts interest rates, well, technically, that should potentially, like, increase, like, or raise asset prices, right? Because, like, the discount cash flow model, et cetera. And then maybe that can lead to a defi bull market on its own. So no matter what the interest rates are, defi can survive. Therefore, it's anti fragile. When the markets are volatile, these platforms can make fees and the fundamentals look good. That's cool.
00:46:45.080 - 00:47:05.092, Speaker A: But if fees are low, well, at least there's yield to be had from real world assets. Okay, so antifragile there. If people are risk on, like, everyone's, like, celebrating, right? Everyone's high fiving each other. But if everyone's risk off, no one uses applications. Well, maybe, but they can stake stable coins and earn, like, 10%. Okay. Like, that's an anti fragile system.
00:47:05.092 - 00:47:21.360, Speaker A: So that's kind of where my head is at. Let me know what you think. This video is approaching 50 minutes, so. And I'm getting very, very tired. I need to eat lunch soon. Okay, so I'll wrap it up there. So thank you guys watching.
00:47:21.360 - 00:47:47.362, Speaker A: Now, if you don't mind, just try leaving a like, if you like this idea, right? It's hard being a content creator out here.
