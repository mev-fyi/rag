00:00:00.560 - 00:00:31.326, Speaker A: Ever since I made my first video about the bitcoin halving cycle, bitcoin's up almost 60%. How about that in two months? Crazy, right? So where are we in the cycle? You know, in the. In the video, I mentioned that this. This is the type, the shape that bitcoin tends to take where the takeoff period is catalyzed by the bitcoin having. And bitcoin slowly grinding higher before you. A major sell off, and then just going parabolic after the complete nuts. I think we're still really early.
00:00:31.326 - 00:01:14.070, Speaker A: Like, we're still in the midpoint before the first sell off. So it's natural to think, like, when can I expect the sell off? Should I start selling my bitcoin and all that and all those questions? And it's reasonable to expect that the first sell off occur roughly around 20,000, because that was the previous all time high. And, you know, there's also the round number theory where, you know, 20,000 is a big number. It's easy to sell bitcoin. People that bought bitcoin up here that got wrecked can now sell at a profit or break even. So people are really expecting, you know, we're going to keep going to 20k, we're going to go down, and then we're going to go completely to the moon. Here's a different approach I like to think about.
00:01:14.070 - 00:01:56.550, Speaker A: Instead of looking at the price, let's look at the. The overall market cap of bitcoin. So basically, taking the price of bitcoin and multiplying it by the amount of bitcoin in circulation, November 18, we actually hit an all time high in terms of market cap. What this means is that there is now more money invested in bitcoin than there were. Than there were in 2017. So everyone expects twenty k to be heavy resistance. But what if the buyers just keep coming in and we just blow past it? You're not going to be happy selling your bitcoin or even just like, not even buying bitcoin, because you expect this, you know, the pullback.
00:01:56.550 - 00:02:35.844, Speaker A: And if you look at just Google trends, bitcoin, we're not even close, right? Like, we're at 12%. Like, we're at the. We're at twelve right now, which means only 12% of. There's only 12% interest in bitcoin compared to where we were in late 2017. And, you know, in this channel, I like to try to educate everyone on how to make more money and how to invest in crypto assets. So I like to bring to attention this money flow in crypto. And I'll basically explain really simply when people make money in bitcoin, bitcoin tends to be the first thing everyone invests in because it's the biggest name and it makes the most sense.
00:02:35.844 - 00:03:26.150, Speaker A: People get greedy and, you know, they'll take the profits in bitcoin and put into large caps, like mainly Ethereum. And then, you know, as people make more money in bitcoin and ethereum, they'll invest in more mid caps and low cap coins that you see here. You don't really have to know what these things do, but quite frankly, I think the prices of these assets are going to go higher if bitcoin's price goes higher. So I'm going to take a look at Ethereum and Chainlink, the biggest market cap coins, ethereum being 53 billion market cap and chainlink being 5 billion in market cap. So take a look at this long chart of Ethereum. Let's start from the left side. You see the dollar 400 figure acted as heavy resistance in 2017, where the price of Ethereum was rejected twice.
00:03:26.150 - 00:03:58.530, Speaker A: And right before we just literally mooned. Let's zoom in. The $400 figure was heavy support. So, you know, we got, finally got past $400, came back to 400 and just went blasted off. And then it also acted as support here, here, before just plummeting down to like $80. Really painful. So where are we now? So we're at a similar point where the $400 figure is, you know, really is getting really, really important.
00:03:58.530 - 00:04:54.940, Speaker A: So if you zoom in on where we are now, this is October 2020, you see this trend line that I written that drawn in here, which has acted pretty well in terms of resistance and support. And $400 figure was important here, and $445 was important here. And I think I can say that Ethereum has already put in the bottom and we're going to go higher. How much higher? I don't know, but I think it's totally possible that we eclipse 1600 and go even two k. Like, I'm not going to give a price target, but I think Ethereum is going higher because of this money cycle. And as people get more greedy, they're going to invest in smaller market cap coins. So this is a relatively young crypto asset called Chainlink.
00:04:54.940 - 00:05:31.368, Speaker A: When, you know, Chainlink literally went from $4 in June to $20 a five bagger, a five x in August. And then, you know, we're at roughly $13. Now, similarly to Ethereum, we can see that there are, you know, really important price levels to look at. And I like, just take a look at this channel. It was, it consolidated here before just going to the moon, and then it acted as heavy resistance here three times, actually. And now we're at the point where if you zoom in, we try to get rejected here twice. So once here and once here.
00:05:31.368 - 00:05:53.134, Speaker A: But now we're putting in support here. So, you know, full disclosure, I own these two assets and I think it's going to go higher. And, you know, similarly to Ethereum, you see this channel that, you know, it's a, it's bouncing. It's bouncing here and I think it will go higher. So this isn't investment advice. It's not financial advice. I can't give that.
00:05:53.134 - 00:06:10.870, Speaker A: But, you know, just thinking about, you know, other than bitcoin, what kind of assets should I invest in? Ethereum and Chainlink are the two assets that I'm looking into. Thanks for watching. And if you can smash the like button and subscribe, it'll really support the channel. And see you later.
