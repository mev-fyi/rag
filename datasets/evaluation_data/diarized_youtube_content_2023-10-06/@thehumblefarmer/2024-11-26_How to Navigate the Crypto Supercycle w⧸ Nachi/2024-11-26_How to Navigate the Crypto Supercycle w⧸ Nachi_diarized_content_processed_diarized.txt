00:00:00.080 - 00:00:12.920, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Tyche here and welcome to the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. I'm visiting California, my home, for Thanksgiving, so I don't have my usual setup here with me, but I had to get the myth legend Nachi on. How are you doing today?
00:00:13.040 - 00:00:13.848, Speaker B: I'm great.
00:00:13.984 - 00:00:24.740, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. So I think anyone on crypto Twitter or crypto X knows who you are. But for those that don't, can you give a brief intro of how you got into crypto and what you do now?
00:00:26.090 - 00:01:25.120, Speaker B: So I joined crypto back in 2018. Before that I worked in Trevi. I was a fixed income fund manager looking for 5 to 7% returns every year. So it's a pretty boring job. And then I actually saw bitcoin went from like 1k to 20k in 2017 when I was like b is I was busy, so busy working on my job and I, I, I felt like I really missed out something. And then I, I actually decided to quit my job in 2018 when a lot of things don't go in my fam favor. In my old job, I also suffered from a pretty serious trauma or eye disorder, which means I couldn't work normally for one to two years.
00:01:25.120 - 00:01:49.992, Speaker B: So that led me to think about what I want to achieve in my life. And then because trading has always been my huge passion, I always wanted to trade full time, making trading as my full time job. So I decided to make a reboot decision to quit my job and then going the crypto rabbit hole in 2018.
00:01:50.096 - 00:02:16.590, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really similar story to mine. I didn't really join at the bottom, but I know I saw bitcoin pump. I thought it was a scam. And then a few years later I'm like, okay, this thing's actually cool. So I also I guess quit my job to just really dive into this full time. So I guess I was reading your previous Block Beats interview. I can link that in the description below for the viewers, but I think you've had your first big win.
00:02:16.590 - 00:02:21.538, Speaker A: That's not bitcoin during defi summer. Can you just briefly talk about that?
00:02:21.674 - 00:02:58.170, Speaker B: Right. So I started dive into the space in 2018. So at that point I was just slowly trying out different protocols and I came across defi. There are only a few protocols defi protocols back then. But I was very interested in trying out new things. So I tried out Kyber. I also look at what maker does and, and, and dive deeper and I really think that there, there's a huge potential right there.
00:02:58.170 - 00:03:36.894, Speaker B: And at that point the V the val the valuation of all these defi tokens are extremely low that you can, you can, at that point AAVE is still, you know, rebranding and then you can basically buy all these defi coins at really, really low valuation because no one was using it. But I, I really sense that there is something very promising and right there, once I've tried long enough, it's just, it just lacks some catalysts. But I always know that it's time will come.
00:03:36.982 - 00:03:49.374, Speaker A: Got it. So I guess you were just accumulating all these defi tokens while they were cheap, while TPL was still very low. Did it help that you had a trash fight background so you could kind of see this early?
00:03:49.542 - 00:04:36.212, Speaker B: I think that helps a bit. But to be honest, at that point no one believes that defi would really be becomes huge. And at that point I was introduced to a lot of friends working in crypto and then I asked them about defi. Basically even, even those working in crypto doesn't really believe in defi. I remember that some, some crypto friends working in the space saying that finance could never be decentralized. You know, first, you know, first meeting, basically telling everything that basically tell me to get out of defi. Don't invest your money in it, don't invest your chips in it.
00:04:36.212 - 00:04:48.228, Speaker B: But the more I try it out, the more I find it could be pretty promising. It just lacks some catalysts which will.
00:04:48.284 - 00:05:22.452, Speaker A: Come at some point in 2018, 2019 and even in the early parts of 2020. DeFi is pretty clunky, right? It didn't really work, but I guess you were intellectually curious so you would try things out. You saw that, okay, if there is some catalyst in the future, there can really TVL can actually pump. But your friends didn't really believe in it. How do you build conviction in something where you're the only one that's like a believer, right? How do you be contrarian and believe in something in crypto, I think you.
00:05:22.476 - 00:06:13.090, Speaker B: Just need to have patience in the whole crypt, in the whole whole crypto space in general. No matter how you don't believe, no matter how things look clunky, look looks like games. It doesn't look look to be promising. You just have to be super open minded in this space to be able to rep the gains earlier than most, most people out there. So I just keep monitoring the defi space. I listen to every podcast I can hear and I also speak to everyone working in the space that I can reach at that point and then just slowly Gaining my conviction. I always tell myself that Defi doesn't work right now.
00:06:13.090 - 00:06:50.670, Speaker B: It has no users. But it's also true that no one really believes in it. No one thinks it's going to work. That's why it has such a low valuation. But if I'm the right contrarian and I'm right on this thesis, then it would be life changing for me if I accumulate these tokens early. So I just start accumulating some of the tokens early at that point. Basically at the start, like a starting position, this kind of stuff.
00:06:50.670 - 00:06:53.070, Speaker B: Take it as a core option at the start.
00:06:53.190 - 00:07:15.098, Speaker A: I guess that was Defi Summer or that was before Defi Summer. And once Defi Summer got started, everything went up 100x and you decided to just really cash in on, I guess, your bags. Let's talk about this cycle. So I have some questions around. You know, the things that you've been bulbosing. I mean your profile picture is a horse with. With a hat.
00:07:15.098 - 00:07:28.778, Speaker A: So I'll ask about memes later. But I think previously you've mentioned that you think we are in the beginning of a golden bull run. So can you kind of expand on that and I guess your mental framework for where we are in the current cycle.
00:07:28.874 - 00:08:30.718, Speaker B: Right. So I believe that we didn't really have an off season for the whole. For the whole bull cycle from early 2023. We only have a meme coin bull cycle and a bitcoin boost cycle. So. But we are fine. But we are finally entering the phrase that when bitcoin hits 100k and then people start to look at other altcoin bags outside of meme coins and I give or Yi finally starts pumping, I think that's the time that people really finally start to rotate the capital outside of bitcoin and some people rotate some of the capital outside of meme coins to chase other altcoins because we are finally entering this phase of all season which typically lasts around like two months or could be two months or more.
00:08:30.854 - 00:08:49.182, Speaker A: So I guess you've been a big proponent of holding bitcoin Solana and meme coins. I guess mostly right. Do you think that there could be a rotation to things like eth, as you said in other tech, I guess alts or is it like a short term rotation? How do you think about which sector will perform the best this cycle?
00:08:49.246 - 00:09:28.416, Speaker B: Right. To be honest, it's already proven that memes perform the best this cycle thing. No one can really bargain on that. And then for the main for majors you have bitcoin solana and then you can also say basically microstrategy outperforms so much, even outperforms Nvidia. If you, if you look at the price from early 2020, that's just freaking crazy. So on the other side you can now C Capital rotating to. To other other tokens.
00:09:28.416 - 00:10:24.762, Speaker B: The EVE ecosystem is already started started pumping and there are also a lot of like old Dino coins from last cycle pump a lot like 50%, 60% of nowhere in a few days. So it's for sure that capital has already. Some of the capital has already rotated outside outside to like the EVE ecosystem, the old L1 Eco, the old L1s for instance, to look for some extra gains. And of course a lot of those old projects will run this momentum to basically pump their own coin. So that's what happens. You see in the past week or so there are so many Dino coins pumping, but I'm sure that a lot of them are like the insiders pumping it for the retail to join. Right?
00:10:24.866 - 00:10:55.358, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like the XRP people. I mean, okay, I'm not going to hate on any single coin, but people on Twitter have claimed that XRP people are trying to be an advisor for the Trump administration. And then the coin starts pumping the crazy amount. You've mostly been bullish Solana this cycle over eth, right. And I think in a past interview you said that Solana is like the eat of the cycle. Right. It's gaining users and whatnot.
00:10:55.358 - 00:11:00.366, Speaker A: Do you think that Solana will continue up forming ETH or what are your views there?
00:11:00.438 - 00:12:04.500, Speaker B: I mean Ethereum at its moment, I think it started to show that it's finally catching up. That doesn't mean that Ethereum is a, is a strong, you know, is a. Is stronger than Solana as the whole ecosystem in this stage. It's just we are at the, at the later part of the cycle such that all the leg gas will get pumped and Ethereum is just one of the biggest Legos in the space. So you know, Solana just hit around all time high. So of course naturally it would need some, some healthy consolidation and then for, and then for other other L1s including Ethereum to, to make a run before Solana to make another big run. So the go the capital just keeps rotating from here and they're searching for, searching for more gains in the.
00:12:04.500 - 00:12:05.856, Speaker B: In short, in short term.
00:12:05.948 - 00:12:25.656, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess it's all these capital rotations. It's like okay, Bitcoin pumped and it's a lot of pumps. So let's try to pump the things that are unpumped. But I guess are you playing these rotation games or are you just sitting in your hands in your higher conviction bags just trying to manifest pumps? How are you positioned right now?
00:12:25.808 - 00:12:57.880, Speaker B: So of course I have my core bass, I have my core backs, I have my core pass a lot of them in memes. But I also have some of the capital taking part, taking. Taking part taking the. Playing the rotation game in others ways. So I just put some of the capital in other sectors such as AI. I put some capital in other L1s just, just to play some, some short term rotation games. That's it.
00:12:57.920 - 00:13:23.796, Speaker A: So let's talk about your memes because you said that you know, you, you have a core meme holding. It seems like you were contrarian and early and right for DeFi in 2018 through 2020 and you have been bullet posting memes throughout the cycle. So you have been right there as well. This is a tweet from when is this? November 8th. So this is like good goat. Morning Nero and Mudang. Welcome to our new zoo.
00:13:23.796 - 00:13:35.520, Speaker A: So it seems like you're bullish the animals here. Can you talk about your I guess meme thesis for this cycle and we can talk about the individual coins later. But just you know, let's start with like what is your main point thesis for the cycle?
00:13:35.600 - 00:13:44.220, Speaker B: I'm not going to say something spectacular like Murat said. I'm not going to.
00:13:44.520 - 00:13:45.940, Speaker A: He's a great speaker.
00:13:46.520 - 00:14:14.172, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Honestly, of course for, for everyone like you know, holding the meme coins, holding the meme coins they want to hold. They always want to listen to like super spec spectacular story. We are in this ultra super duper meme con cycle for like 5 to 10 years. Honestly. No one knows. No.
00:14:14.172 - 00:14:51.696, Speaker B: And no one has has crystal ball to be to. To be honest, the only thing, the only thing I can say that we are already in, in in midway of this meme consumer cycle. So a lot of meme coins, you know, pump so quickly from, from nothing to a few hundred million or even to a billion. And of course gold is the outlier. It pumped to nearly a billion from. From zero for like 15 days. So we are definitely in a meme con super cycle.
00:14:51.696 - 00:15:46.564, Speaker B: And we are right, we are right there how long and how many years it's going to take? Honestly, no one knows. But I believe that the meme coin space still have a lot of room to grow bigger and we are now in the mid stage. Mid stage at least for a lot of meme tokens. We are at a meat stage of it. And then for some of the new memes like AI memes like go I think we are still at the early phase because the AI memes only started for around two months. But if you talk about memes like with existed more than one year already and not to mention about Doge and Pepe for instance, they existed much longer. So for some of the memes we're in the mid cycle.
00:15:46.564 - 00:15:53.002, Speaker B: For some of them memes we are still on the early cycle. Depends on what you think about this.
00:15:53.106 - 00:16:20.348, Speaker A: I definitely agree. Why do you think this is happening? A lot of people say that it's because VC coins are just launching at too high of a valuation. Retail gets fleeced. So if retail is going to speculate on crypto coins, they might as well speculate on things that could pump or things that are lower market cap. Like memes have like do you have any views on like why this is happening? Whereas like last cycle it was more around tech and defi and alto ones.
00:16:20.444 - 00:16:58.304, Speaker B: Good question. So basically I think that the the sector which attracts most most capital no matter is because of entertainment. No matter is because of of money ultimate ultimately the most. The the sector which attracts the most demand will win. So what does retail. Well so the space, this space right now is still consisted of mostly retail. So what does the retail care about? So they care about money, they care about entertainment.
00:16:58.304 - 00:17:55.910, Speaker B: I think that's you know like most read most retail in this space really really cares. So does those VC coins give you how retail make a lot of money? Definitely not because they raise as sky high valuations. You can see that from all the coins listed early half of this year they were all down only. So all the coins listed in Binance early of the year were down only. So there's no money to be made for by, by this retail but they get wrecked. And also whether there's an entertainment value right there, I don't think there's. There's much either because a lot of those VC coins are are just the natural extension of other other VC coins last cycle.
00:17:55.910 - 00:18:44.242, Speaker B: So there are not many innovative stuff here. There are not many new stuff that the retail can play. So there's also not much entertainment value there. For instance for Defi last cycle you can say that all the Defi games are new. So the loop boring in Compound AAVE and then you got wi Fi and then you got all the Ponzi stuff Lunar everything is so new. It's so fresh. Right? But in this cycle you, you don't all those VC projects don't really offer this kind of entertainment value and they don't offer offer an opportunity to make make money either.
00:18:44.242 - 00:18:47.682, Speaker B: So what was the game in town? Memes. That's the only.
00:18:47.786 - 00:19:13.852, Speaker A: I agree. Like I mean last cycle, you know I was known for aping into Ponzi yield farms and I mean we all knew it was a Ponzi but it was just fun, right? It's like oh my God, this coin. Stake it here at million percent apy. Why is it pumping? I have no idea. But MMORPG game. But I think the yield farming game has mostly been solved. We all know how it ends.
00:19:13.852 - 00:19:49.180, Speaker A: At some point it goes to zero and obviously right like meme coins are dangerous and most go to zero. But we have already seen all these stories of like whiff or any of these coins pumping and retail is naturally just going to want to chase these pumps. And speaking of chasing these pumps, you mentioned AI memes in goat. I also love the goatsy. So you posted here that you notchy. If Truth Terminal wants to hear it directly from the horse's mouth, then I shall speak. I have acquired 4% of goat supply.
00:19:49.180 - 00:20:07.362, Speaker A: 4%. It will be the trade of the cycle. So first of all can you kind of talk about your goat thesis and did you just mark it by 4%? How do you think about position sizing here? But yeah, but first let's talk about your goat thesis.
00:20:07.426 - 00:20:54.560, Speaker B: AI memes are the perfect intersection between AI and memes which you talk about is the Omega cycle which everyone should have listen to to your V to your video, right? Yeah. So basically it unites the left, mid and right curve easily. Right? So when the AI memes like go out, you can see so many not only left curve people with the right curve people or the venture venture venture guys. The vc. The VC guys even they can't invest in these memes in for the vc. But all of them are very interested in GO and this new matter. So I think this point is very clear for everyone.
00:20:54.560 - 00:21:27.478, Speaker B: But I want to talk about the significance of Truth of Terminal and Go and how it kickstart this crazy new experiment. And I think you know, everyone didn't know about AI before ChatGPT released. The gap between the reality and. And. And dream was. Was. Was so big and no, nobody really really knew what what is AI.
00:21:27.478 - 00:22:23.130, Speaker B: But when ChatGPT released everyone was like boom, okay, I know what is what is coming next. I know what stage AI is at right right now. So I think actually the AI memes give me this chatgpt Moment in crypto actually. Why? Because it actually I think a lot too many people focus in trading the memes and making money. But a lot of people actually didn't realize that we. We've only spent two months starting from this new AI meme method started by Truth of Terminal and go. And then we have already seen so many experiments started already.
00:22:23.130 - 00:22:49.220, Speaker B: For instance, you can see a lot of boss actually can read and understand what people treat on Twitter and then reply them meaningfully. And then you can also see Dao setting up to. For. For AI to make. To make best for. For. For.
00:22:49.220 - 00:23:25.930, Speaker B: For different portfolios. And then you also see some. Some new. All different kind of AI new experience which have never been seen. This cycle which is so innovative actually reminds me so much about like what we've experienced early Defi Summer. What we've experienced in Defi Summer. And to me, this really like the chat GPT moment in AI cross crossover crossover crypto because everything is so new.
00:23:25.930 - 00:23:38.850, Speaker B: You never know how. How far this. This would. This would go. Because these are AI boss. You never know where the ceiling is. So just.
00:23:38.850 - 00:23:40.502, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah.
00:23:40.646 - 00:24:06.442, Speaker A: I think the two things you said earlier makes a lot of sense. Things like go. It unites the left curve, the right curve and the mid curve. Right. So people like me, we can all buy into this because it's pretty easy to rationalize. And I think I've been saying like the AI meme coins, right? Like Omega Cycle. I've kind of been like memeing online, but I'm not even sure if meme coin is term.
00:24:06.442 - 00:24:33.460, Speaker A: I'm not even sure if the meme coin or if meme coin is like the right word. I feel like they're more tokenized LLM or tokenized AGI, but maybe that sounds too complicated and nerdy. So we'll keep it as like meme coins. But all these agents, they're going to keep improving with the tech. So you can't just evaluate it for what it is now. You kind of have to dream, right? For the future. It allows you to dream, right? This is a new sector that allows us to dream big.
00:24:33.460 - 00:24:51.124, Speaker A: It's like, what could this be? I don't know. But it's going to get a lot bigger. And I think that's one characteristic of a future bubble and reflexive cycles. It's similar to how you saw Defi early but no one else was like. Or everyone else was like, oh, that's not going to work. Right. It's kind of clunky.
00:24:51.124 - 00:25:15.280, Speaker A: And then wifi just goes from Zero to a billion market cap. And then everyone's like, wow, this is the future of finance. So it always takes some initiating catalyst to get people to dream. And then over time, things will develop and then it'll convert more people over time. And that's kind of the cycle I think will look like for these AI memes. Do you have any thoughts on that?
00:25:17.340 - 00:26:11.386, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, of course. Honestly, if you look at the meme space right now, most of them, most of them are dogs and cats. But honestly, how far and how different these dogs and cat memes can go, right? Basically, we have a very clear answer in our head. But for AI memes, actually, no one knows how far and how crazy they could go. So basically, for investing in crypto, you want to invest in something which allows people to dream big, dream huge with. With no limits, Right? Why do. Why does people love porn? Ponzi last cycle, like, like Lunar, for instance, is because the positive loop just enables you to keep going higher and higher.
00:26:11.386 - 00:26:32.860, Speaker B: There. There are no limits. Right. But for these animal memes, there are limits because there are just animals. But for these AI memes, you never know how big and how crazy they could go. This is actually the kind of the dream and Ponzi element that everyone would want to have.
00:26:33.560 - 00:26:34.340, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:34.840 - 00:27:00.020, Speaker B: That's why when I saw that tree talking about my Andreessen sending 50k to Andy to start this dusted whole new AI research and truth of Terminal, this kind of thing, and then in my head, I was think, okay, this is it. I have to keep hitting the buy button. You have to keep as much as I can.
00:27:00.720 - 00:27:40.598, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, you. I think you hit the buy button a lot of times. How many times did you have to click the buy button to get to 4% of go? Like, I mean, how do you think? Like, how do you. First of all, I have so many questions. How do you think about position sizing? So it's clear that, you know, you build conviction on this trade, but, like, okay, like, obviously you're like a very successful trader, so you have a lot of money, but is this like, you know, is this like a under 10% sizing for you and you're just thinking of holding it for the cycle? How do. How do you build conviction? How do you think about sizing, portfolio construction? Can you kind of just touch on those points?
00:27:40.734 - 00:28:39.480, Speaker B: I really have to get very excited for me on the trade before I can build meaning, meaningful size. So. So for, for instance, like, when I look at Go this kind of really rare opportunity, and then on top of my head, I was like, okay, I, I, I must, I must get, you know, if I, if I can, at least 5 to 10% of my portfolio, at least. So basically, basically at least 5 to 10%, I'm willing for this kind of, of trade, which I think the sky is the limit. And then I also assess that the risk is pretty low. Then I will risk all the money I, I have. I mean that all, I risk all the money that I built into this position.
00:28:39.940 - 00:28:41.196, Speaker A: Got it, got it.
00:28:41.348 - 00:29:40.770, Speaker B: Right. So but for, but for other trays, for instance, if there are, there are already like established projects already listed on sex, which is, you know, much, much safer. And then I would be able to take very variable sizing ranging from 5, 5% to 30%. Depends on my conviction on the trade, both fundamentally and technically. And yeah, that's basically it. But for building positional, for building size, of course, I, I do buy trenches, so I usually at least do four trenches. So usually after I, I, I bought the first and second trench, I would get a very good feeling that whether this trade has a high probability to, to win or not.
00:29:40.770 - 00:29:42.386, Speaker B: And then I take it from there.
00:29:42.458 - 00:30:08.400, Speaker A: Got it, Got it. Yeah. So I guess I, you know, I've read all the market wizards books and there's some commonalities there. I guess you first build conviction, you buy a little bit, and then you get a feel for the narrative of the thesis. And then, you know, as you feel more confident, you can add more over time. So I guess you kind of have tranches like, you know, you buy once, then second time, three times, and then you eventually get to a size that you want. Is that kind of, is that clear?
00:30:09.580 - 00:30:41.164, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct. That's correct. And one point I want to add is I really like to own leader of this, of the space. For instance, like the meme sectors, I own all, I own all the leaders of different subsectors. So for instance, for, for dogs, I, I own doge. I don't, I own with and, and a bit of bonk. And then for cat coins, I will only I own some podcasts.
00:30:41.164 - 00:31:05.000, Speaker B: So I always like to, to buy the leaders because I just feel better and less volatility. I can also build a bigger size. There's also a bigger mode and there's also better liquidity. And of course, if the trade is a new matter and it's still, and it's still relatively early, then it's even better.
00:31:05.620 - 00:31:56.124, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah, I've kind of had this question or I don't know the answer to the question I've been asking this myself, but obviously with meme coins, the first meme coin has a moat, right? It's like the first, right? Doge is the first. Therefore Doge will probably not be flipped by any other meme coin. But when it comes to the AI memes, maybe they're not pure memes, they're more of like a tech play. So potentially they could get flipped. You had this tweet here where you bought some, I guess, AI 16Z Zerbro, some Fartcoin. Do you think goat will continue to be number one or do you think it could be flipped? And I guess like, you know, you own a lot of go, but can you just briefly talk about, you know, the small, like the mid to smaller cat memes? Do you still think that they're decent trades?
00:31:56.252 - 00:33:20.904, Speaker B: The reason that I own so much gold is because I, I think that the leader of, of this, this space actually for, for a lot of different sectors is the same as well. Because Truth of Terminal is the first AI experiment and the first AI meme, it came out of nowhere and then it was the first supported by a 16C. Basically its dominance cannot be competed by any other AI memes. Even if you think that other AI memes can, can make a better board, they can treat better, they can reply messages to people better, but that doesn't matter, right? Because if you learn about the story between like Bitcoin and all the other, all the other bitcoin folks trying, trying to beat, trying to beat Bitcoin, no pro, no, no projects really work and enable flip Bitcoin because people will always think that the first one is all, always, will always have a special, special space in this, it will also have a special space. So basically to me, gold is the BTC in AI memes. It will never be flipped. So that's why I own a huge chunk of gold.
00:33:20.904 - 00:33:26.104, Speaker B: And for the other AI meme best, I only hold a much smaller position.
00:33:26.192 - 00:33:45.900, Speaker A: Okay. No, I appreciate that thought. That's really interesting. I keep, you know, going back and forth on this. I think I do agree, I think I do agree the story is very compelling and technically bitcoin doesn't have the best tech, but it's the first. You can say that for a lot of other coins. But now I do want to pivot to audience questions.
00:33:45.900 - 00:34:00.754, Speaker A: So Mr. Ng here asks with these memes, what is your take profit strategy? And I guess, do you have some useful things you've learned this month from just trading memes on chain that you.
00:34:00.762 - 00:35:15.252, Speaker B: Didn'T know before profit taking strategy while trading memes on chain. So I think a prudent strategy would be when for instance if you want to look at all the AI memes and then you do some. I know a lot of people actually don't do any research but they a first research research later. I think that's all right if the size is more and you're willing to risk everything. But for me, my approach is I still do some research no matter what because even for AI meme projects there are still so many that I want to spread my best into the ones which have a high probability to hit. So I normally won't ape into a meme when it's just launched, but I want to wait longer until there's a high probability that it will survive before I enter into a position. So that's my strategy for entering the position.
00:35:15.252 - 00:36:21.076, Speaker B: So for take profit strategies and for these new AI memes I will usually know, take some off after it went up for, for a few weeks just to you know, lower, lower my cost a bit and then, and then ride the rest. And honestly I'm very good at looking at technicals but for, for, for all these early memes there are actually not much technicals that you can take, you can rely on, but you can look at like how bas roughly how diversified the holders are, whether there's a strong, strong, you know, cabal behind by looking at the, at the price action, whether they're controlling the memes and controlling the, the price well, whether the project makes sense, whether it has more longevity, this, this kind of of stuff. Right? And then when you make, look at all these stuff and make it, make a judgment and then you decide whether you size up or not.
00:36:21.148 - 00:36:43.610, Speaker A: Hey Tyche here. If you're enjoying the content, please like and subscribe.

Now back to the episode. So I think you're number six now on Binance. Of course you know, this goes, this changes every time but you've been a very successful trader I guess on Purp's Spot, etc.
00:36:43.610 - 00:36:49.094, Speaker A: How did you get here? And I guess what are some common traits of successful traders, right?
00:36:49.182 - 00:37:32.520, Speaker B: How do I get here? I just keep grinding, you know, every, every cycle, every month, every week maybe, maybe every day. Just, just keep maintaining the drive to get, get better. Being very open minded, very humble but. But still, but remain but remains having the Drive to get better and better. So when you look at all those, all the most successful people, for instance, like Steve Jobs would always say, like, stay hungry, stay foolish. Right. No matter how successful you are, stay hungry, stay foolish.
00:37:32.520 - 00:38:27.654, Speaker B: That's what I always, always remember. So my goal is just, just keep getting better and better, proving to myself, my family and, and everyone that like even someone who suffered from, from severe adversity many years ago can live or can live a very different life, can, can prove themselves, can earn respect from, from other people. And yeah, I just, just want to do something which is meaningful, meaningful to me. And then later when I make, you know, when I become, become, became a great enough, enough, enough trader, which I, I started doing is trying to, to make donations here and there to, and to, to make the world better.
00:38:27.782 - 00:39:14.148, Speaker A: No, that's, that's really great of you, you know, and thank you for sharing earlier and just now that I guess when you were working your old job, you had some trauma and you couldn't really work for a year or two. Can I dig a little bit deeper on that? So, I mean, you don't, you don't have to, you know, talk or you can go as deep as you want, but I guess what did you learn from having this, you know, this trauma? And you obviously bounced back, but obviously I think every person in crypto has gone through their ups and downs. Right. Like when everything's pumping, it's like, I'm a genius. And then you wake up. I think in your interview you said that in May 2021, I think there was a day where everything went down like 50% in a single day. And your portfolio 70%.
00:39:14.148 - 00:39:27.140, Speaker A: Right. So I guess how do you deal from things like big pullbacks or drawdowns or just these trauma events? Is this constant belief in yourself. Yeah. If you can expand on any of those points.
00:39:28.000 - 00:40:16.008, Speaker B: Right. To, to be honest, when I suffered from, from that trauma. So I had an eye disorder, which basically I have really, really blurred vision one day when I woke up. So I look at my computer and then everything is blurred. I can't work, I can't see anything. I don't know what, what, what happened. And then it took, it literally took me more than one year to find out I have a rare eye disease, which is something that could be, the situation could be moderated and fixed short term, as long as I don't do some crazy things.
00:40:16.008 - 00:41:04.710, Speaker B: But I need to do an operation. But it does, doesn't mean that the operation must be successful. There's some failure rate. There so even if you complete the operation, the situation may not get stabilized. And if you do another operation discount stuff. So I really don't this does first time in life that I really can't calculate my probabilities on how much probability that I'll get I'll be blind how much probability that I recover this kind of stuff. So I was, I, so I had depression back then because there are, there's just so much uncertainty right there and even the doctor at that time can't tell me what's coming.
00:41:04.710 - 00:41:56.530, Speaker B: So what I did was, you know, I just do a combination of things. I did a lot of meditation, I went to Chinese doctors to, to subscribe some medicines to help with my emotions. And then I do a lot of exercises all the time. That's how I, that's how I gone through it. And then, and then luckily I, I, I, someone introduced a good doctor to me and then told me, told me what, what, what really happened. And then later I did the operation, got the problem temporary fixed. Although I still have some eyesight issues which means that I actually get tied quite easily.
00:41:56.530 - 00:42:56.762, Speaker B: So that means I have to focus a lot of time on my trace. For instance, I don't have the luxury to be able to for instance doing a lot of trees like sharing a lot of trees on, on online at the same time also manage my trades. Well, I, I have to. That's why I can only only trade once in a while. But I, but I, but I, but I bounced back so, so so much after, after my eye eye problems were fixed and then in hindsight it's probably like the best thing that's changed my life because after that happened it made me think about what is really meaningful to my life. What do I really want to achieve. It made me very driven and have a, and made array certain, certain, certain goal on what I want to achieve.
00:42:56.762 - 00:43:03.756, Speaker B: And then things just get better and better when I grind harder and harder in the, in the past few years.
00:43:03.898 - 00:43:23.208, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. No, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing that. You know, I guess I've shared my story before but I mean it's not really similar but I guess like I lost my mom to cancer when I was young and it was like hard but I like got through it and I think I became like a better man as a result. Like, like a stronger man.
00:43:23.344 - 00:43:24.616, Speaker B: I didn't know that.
00:43:24.768 - 00:43:57.470, Speaker A: Oh no, no, it's okay. But it's more, it's more like this idea that you know, the, the world beats you down. It's like something you have zero control over. And then you're like, what the fuck is happening? And then once you bounce back, you feel like you can achieve anything. And I think a common misconception maybe is that successful traders in crypto or just anywhere in general are just eternally online. But it sounds like, you know, you don't have the luxury of just looking at your screen every single like 16 hours a day. Right.
00:43:57.470 - 00:44:15.990, Speaker A: So I guess your trading style has to adjust for I guess your eye condition. Right. So I guess now you just have to build a lot more conviction on each trade. You have maybe you have like a longer time horizon. Like what would, like what is your trading style? Like, how would you describe your trading style?
00:44:16.410 - 00:45:06.874, Speaker B: Actually it's better that way because honestly I want to see. I honestly believe that the longer the time horizon, the easier to make big money. So the shorter time you sit on a trade, the less money you can, you can make you. When you, when you look at the history or the investment legends, all the big traits are made by sitting on a, all the money are made on, on seating rather than like trading day, day in, day out. So Right. I think that's, that's not a, that's actually not a big problem. So I would say my style is this highly discretionary and directional and I pick, I pick my best very selectively.
00:45:06.874 - 00:45:49.620, Speaker B: But if, but if I chose that bed, I normally go bigger than, than, than a lot of people. So you will see that, that my trace it as long as it went well, you go really, really well. Because I selectively, I, I, I, I normally only pick those like double H a setup which has a very high probability win and then I add on the position when the probability is in, in my favor. So my hit rate is normally pretty high. And when I hit the trade is usually pretty damn good.
00:45:50.320 - 00:46:11.130, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, so your hit rate's pretty good. You said that you only take really high probability bets or asymmetric risk reward. So what are the characteristics of these highly probabilistic trades? Just yeah, can you talk about what you need to see for you to put on size?
00:46:11.870 - 00:46:46.500, Speaker B: Right. The high probability traits are the ones with fundamental and technical both aligned. So for instance, an example would be finding gold early. So fundamentally it's a very new matter. No one knows where the valuation is. Sky's the limit. And then it's also the first of all the AI new experiments.
00:46:46.500 - 00:47:08.682, Speaker B: So that's AAA fundamentally. And then for technically or look for the good time, some of the better timings in the chart to enter my positions at the size and slowly build up the size.
00:47:08.746 - 00:47:18.234, Speaker A: Basically you look at the fundamentals, the narrative and the technicals, and if all those align, then those are the setups that you typically want to take.
00:47:18.322 - 00:47:59.994, Speaker B: Yep. So that's basically Druckenmita's approach. Right. If you listen to his story, then Drucken Millers has, at least he talked about, he has two masters in trading. One master is very good at fundamentals, one master is very good at the technicals. So basically his approach is to combine both of them because there are just so many projects, so many stocks out there. So why don't you just pick those dogs with, with, with the best chart with the best fundamentals and then go back on it?
00:48:00.082 - 00:48:12.410, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I think he's, he's famous for just, you know, sizing up on trades, you know, because, and going for the jugular as he says, because if the trade idea is so good, then why aren't you betting more, bro? Right, exactly.
00:48:12.490 - 00:48:12.826, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:48:12.858 - 00:48:13.450, Speaker A: That's what I said.
00:48:13.490 - 00:48:46.022, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one, that's one of the common traits I mentioned about, which is look for best very selectively with high probability. Look at risk, reward. And then the, the trader should be very confident to make big bets. Even if it's contrarian. You should have strong risk management and then you should have good position. Good position sizing. And the last thing I think is very important is as a great trader doesn't give a.
00:48:46.022 - 00:48:59.492, Speaker B: About taking losses. If you're confident enough in, in making money in your trades, you don't, you, you don't care if you need to take a 10 million of loss or 20 million of loss, you'll make it back.
00:48:59.596 - 00:49:32.516, Speaker A: I love it. I love it. I don't know where you're like, I don't give a, I don't give a. About losses. Yeah, but speaking of losses, right, you, you have, it sounds like when it comes to memes, you're betting on the leader because winners should continue to be winners over time. When do you admit that you're wrong? So you have Doge Bonk with popcat go, right. And I'm sure you have other memes and for you to put them on, they're pretty high conviction.
00:49:32.516 - 00:49:52.140, Speaker A: But not all trades end up panning out. So I guess take any of your past trades or current trades as examples. But what, what do you do when you know a trade goes against you? Do you just cut losses and move on? Or like, what do you need to see for you to be like, okay, like I was wrong. Time to just Move on.
00:49:52.520 - 00:50:18.750, Speaker B: Right. First of all the trade. The trade. The first sign that the trade is wrong is you're making losses. So that that's the first sign. And the second sign to me is it doesn't look right in the chart such that when you enter into a position you would have a certain expectation on on your. On the positive scenario that it should.
00:50:18.750 - 00:51:10.260, Speaker B: It should go up in. In certain ways but if it doesn't and then it it get get dumped and then there is some like very bad patterns or huge volume or huge volume pattern happening which which I think has a cause of concern or it dropped below a certain certain strong support that I didn't expect it to happen. I will start to cut but I won't start the. I won't cut 100 of my position. I will also cut in trenches. So sometimes depends on the scenario I will sometimes I will cut half first. Sometimes if I'm very sure about ratio that I'm wrong then I would count like 75 and and leaving the the rest and and for further confirmation.
00:51:10.260 - 00:51:37.230, Speaker B: And of course I have a lot of losing trace in the past as well and I don't mind sharing and one of the worst loss I had is actually shorting on Luna last last cycle. So I I knew Luna is a bubble but I shorted a bit too early and I didn't manage my risk good enough. And then that incurred a pretty big loss.
00:51:38.170 - 00:51:51.250, Speaker A: I think I heard a lot of stories like this where everyone knew as bubble they kept shorting on the way up. But maybe the best time to short was when it was going down. When it starts going down, that's when you should short instead of trying to picot time to top. Right?
00:51:51.370 - 00:51:59.856, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. The best time to shortly is always to ride on the momentum similar to to how we buy breakouts.
00:52:00.048 - 00:52:33.350, Speaker A: Right? Right. Well, thank you Nancy. We're almost an hour in to the conversation. I know you're a busy guy so I don't take too much of your time but I have two more questions. So I always ask this to or this. I always ask this question to a guest but I think a lot of people watching this interview probably sitting on five to six figure portfolios and they really want to make it. So let's just simplify, right? Let's say someone has like a $50,000 portfolio right now and they want to get to like a million, right? That's a lot of people's dream.
00:52:33.350 - 00:52:44.466, Speaker A: How would you advise someone to take a mid size stack and turn it into a large size stack at this Current juncture of the market.
00:52:44.618 - 00:53:16.882, Speaker B: Right. That's a really tough one. And honestly it really depends on each person's circumstance. So if you are new to the space, then you just join the space and then you want to write to five to seven figures. There's still a learning curve you need to make even. I advise you to stick to DAX screenout all day. Basically everyone new to space has to pay some tuition.
00:53:16.882 - 00:54:12.890, Speaker B: So you have to expect that you make, make losses in the first few, few months no matter what. So if you're in that kind of scenario, then I would rather put more of my money into the, into the majors and then take a certain small proportion of your money to play the, the new stuff. If you want to to take more than 10x in a short time, of course you have to stick to deck screener. You're constantly monitoring what is the new meta, what is the new trend. And then you have to ape earlier than, than a lot of people ape early. That's why, that's how people can, can, can make more than 10x20x out of those meme coins. But it's also very difficult and I know a lot of people who are able to make it this way.
00:54:12.890 - 00:55:18.480, Speaker B: They make, they pay a lot of tuition in the first three to six months before they call the big fish. So I think people, people just started trying this out, playing this new game should expect the same. But if you already stick to Dex Greener for like, for, for like six months plus, then I assume you have a pretty good experience in, in chasing memes, in playing memes and then you could be more aggressive about it and just focus on what's the new matter, what's the new matter which is going to become 10x or 20x bigger in the next few months or so and then you just do more research and then buy the leader and then, and then spread and pray into some of their better quality projects in that matter. So yeah, that's basically it.
00:55:18.860 - 00:55:27.956, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess if you're new, understand that you're new, you're not a genius. Just allocate experts some percent of your portfolio.
00:55:28.148 - 00:55:30.676, Speaker B: Self awareness is extremely important.
00:55:30.828 - 00:55:45.040, Speaker A: And I guess the last question I have for you is there's a lot of people watching this and they want to make it. Depending on like what everyone has their own definition of like wanting to make it. But do you have any final words of wisdom to, you know, like the viewers of this podcast?
00:55:45.200 - 00:57:17.680, Speaker B: First of all, I think everyone who grinds hard enough will make it at the end. So the Difference is only about the time. So don't try to over leverage, don't try to think, don't try to aim too too big, too too too greedy and garage too fast because that's always the, the, the best way to ruin yourself. I strongly believe that we are in a very strong, you know, a very, I strongly believe we are in a very strong super cycle that will take many, many years know a 10 to 15 years kind of cycle for, for the, for the space to start, become mature. So there's still a lot of opportunity for you guys to actually ride on a lot of different opportunities. So I, I mean don't, don't try to rush to make it this cycle because when you have Trump, when you have Trump now, you basically are guaranteed to, to have a super cycle like in a, in next four years, meaning it still will still have downside. But Bitcoin probably only have you know, 40 to 50 of, of drawdown now in the bear cycle.
00:57:17.680 - 00:58:01.100, Speaker B: So you, so you have a lot of time to, to make it in this space. I still strongly believe that we have at least you know, 10, 10, 15 years or even 10, 20 years before this space mature. And so take things slowly. Don't try to make it, make it make a crazy leverage leverage bad or like a crazy leverage on your portfolio or even, even a few times, you know, just one time of over leverage with Dell experience and discipline would kill you. So yeah, take it slowly.
00:58:01.600 - 00:58:13.144, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, don't try to, don't try to run it up in like a month. Right. I think you're just saying like if you manage the downside, the upside will take care of itself. So just never.
00:58:13.232 - 00:58:39.960, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. All the investment legends, you know, their portfolio become huge because of compounding effects. It's not because of. You make a crazy trade and you, you make 10 million and overnight. It's not about that Investment is a marathon. So you make your returns by slowly compounding over over years.
00:58:39.960 - 00:59:15.728, Speaker B: Not not by you know, making a crazy. I know I, I know there's something really, really bad like look on chain, you know, always posting some meme coin traders making you know, more than 10 mil or you know, turn a few, a few hundred dollars to a few million. This kind of trips actually, this kind of trips actually mess up people's minds because you know, people will feel FOMO by, by, by by playing some really high risk strategies, but they shouldn't.
00:59:15.824 - 00:59:27.408, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much Nachi, for, for your time. I think you know, there's a lot of good nuggets and I definitely learned a lot. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your time. I.
00:59:27.408 - 00:59:32.786, Speaker A: I know you just had your final words, but do you have any final. Final words before I. We stop. We stop recording?
00:59:32.888 - 01:00:04.886, Speaker B: I think that we are entering the parabolic phase of the cycle. So I think the next two months are going to be crazy. But try not to lose your mind because towards the most crazy, most euphoric phrase of the cycle. Like in. In six. In like two months or so, when everybody shouts for like crazy targets like bitcoin to. To 200k, if.
01:00:04.886 - 01:00:28.854, Speaker B: To 10k is where you should. Should have a lot of caution and then keep, you know, talk to your. Your normie friends who never go into. Into the space about whether they are interested in bitcoin, whether they have made his first purchase. I think the time that they. They've got interest, they've start. They've started to have to be very interested right now.
01:00:28.854 - 01:00:37.058, Speaker B: But the time that. When they. They start to aggressively buying, that's the time that. That's the time that you should start to exit.
01:00:37.154 - 01:00:49.218, Speaker A: Okay, that. That's. That's very encouraging for my bags. You know, a few months of parabolas and then when the normies start buying. Evacuate. Evacuate. Yeah.
01:00:49.314 - 01:00:50.546, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:00:50.738 - 01:00:59.806, Speaker A: Start evacuating at least. Okay, well, thank you so much, Nachi. I. I love this conversation. I think the audience will too. And I hope you enjoyed episode. Yeah.
01:00:59.838 - 01:01:02.814, Speaker B: Really enjoy it. Thanks so much for having me. My pleasure.
