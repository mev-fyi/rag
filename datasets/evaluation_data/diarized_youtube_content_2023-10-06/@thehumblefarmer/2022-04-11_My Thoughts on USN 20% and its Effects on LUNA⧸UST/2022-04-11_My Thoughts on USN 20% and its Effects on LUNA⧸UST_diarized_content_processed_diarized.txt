00:00:01.000 - 00:00:40.285, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here and welcome to the Monday market update. In this video I'll be going over my thoughts on USN, right, the new algorithmic stablecoin that's going to offer 20% yields that's native to denier ecosystem and like I guess like my thoughts on how that's going to affect Luna and ust. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. None of this is financial advice and this is going to be the agenda of the video. I'll be going over what is usn, right? How does that work? Like how is that going to affect USD and why that led me to sell some of my Luna, right? And I'll give my reasonings then and then expectations for us and moving forward. Cool. None of this financial advice.
00:00:40.285 - 00:01:21.965, Speaker A: Okay, so the USN news came out last Thursday, right? And you know this led me to sell somebody Luna last week. I'll go over my reasoning later. But you know, Mr. Cole, Zoran Cole, a well respected member of the crypto community came out with this out of nowhere, right? And it kind of lit like a few views within the I guess the crypto Twitter community. And by the way, if you're in crypto and you know, you're trying to you know, be active and you're not on Twitter, then like you're just going to fall behind, right? Just that's just FYI Twitter is super toxic, right? It's just a bunch of people like you know, it's like sausage fest. People are trying to dunk on each other. But you know, you have to, you have to be on Twitter, right, to get the most up to date news.
00:01:21.965 - 00:01:27.121, Speaker A: And you know, for every 50 bad tweets you're going to read, there's going to be one tweet that actually might help you.
00:01:27.153 - 00:01:27.393, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:27.449 - 00:02:04.223, Speaker A: But anyways, in this article he mentioned, you know that on 420, right? Smoke some weed. And there's also going to be like this thing called usn. It's like NEAR is going to launch it and it's going to be a native algorithmic stablecoin in partnership with other well capitalized stablecoins. Ok And I'll touch on the well capitalized stablecoins aspect later. They're going to offer an attractive 20% APR, right? So it's really similar to that of Luna and USD which he thinks Mr. Zorin Cole is going to ignite defi capital rotation into near ecosystem. Siphoning the TVL from other alt L1 protocols.
00:02:04.223 - 00:02:57.775, Speaker A: And I do agree with his thesis. So before I go over the thesis, right, and what I've been saying for the past couple of months, you know, take a moment, like, how does this make you feel? Because, you know, I've seen so many bad takes on Twitter, right? People that quite frankly, like, lack the critical knowledge, critical thinking, critical thinking skills on how this is going to affect the market, right? Because, you know, maybe you see this and you're like, wow, like, no way it's going to work, right? Like USN USD. Like, no, they're just, this is copying, right? They're losers. Like, they don't know what they're doing, right? Like, the only way to get adoption is by copying other people's successes, right? I mean, I feel like, you know, it triggers a lot of their emotional response. And most of this response comes from mostly comes from like two buckets of people, right? First, people that have missed Luna, right? And they're kind of salty. They think it's a Ponzi and they're like, okay, USN is also another Ponzi currency. I'm not going to invest any money.
00:02:57.775 - 00:03:29.809, Speaker A: Another camp that doesn't like USN are like the Luna Maxis, right? And quite frankly, I like Luna, right? I wish. I hope UST works. I really align with Do Kwon's vision. But you know, I'm not a maxi, right? I'm trying to just extract value from the markets at the end of the day. And, you know, I guess having these emotional responses, I think it's normal, right? You know, it's similar to how like Ethereum Maxis, you know, when it comes to Cardano, like, they don't really see them as a threat. So, you know, they don't really, you know, attack Cardano. They just like joke about it.
00:03:29.809 - 00:03:57.577, Speaker A: Whereas for like Avalanche, right? Ethereum axies, they see Avalanche as a potential threat. So they kind of attack Avalanche, right? Consistently. And I think it's natural for humans to kind of feel defensive when, you know, they feel threatened by something. And I think that's what's happening, right? Or people are just like angry to begin with. I think a better mindset to have when it comes to us and its effect on USD is think of it like this. Hmm, interesting. USN 20% yields, huh? Okay, okay.
00:03:57.577 - 00:04:59.615, Speaker A: So if that's going to happen, how can I predict capital flows into the near ecosystem in the next couple of weeks and how's that going to affect my portfolio? This is how you should be thinking about the markets, right? Like, I feel Like a lot of people in crypto, like, you know, people, like most people in crypto, like, they, they'd rather like sound smart and be right over like making money. Whereas I think the correct scenario, correct approach when it comes to approaching markets is that even if you think something might have, you know, like maybe you don't, maybe you don't think USD is a future, right? But you know, in the short term, like USD 20%, I mean, that's pretty safe yields, right? I think we can all agree on that. And in the past, let's say a couple of months, like, do you think like 20% stablecoin yields would be attractive for the wider market? Yeah. So like, I feel like, I felt like Luna and UST were pretty easy bets to make, right, in 2022, but a lot of people didn't make it because they were just so set in the fact that, okay, like Luna, USD is a Ponzi. So I'm not even going to think about like putting money in it. I feel like it's like a flawed statement. And you know, like people that are against Luna, right.
00:04:59.615 - 00:05:45.543, Speaker A: I feel like most of them, like they were like their portfolio would have done much better if they just like kept like put their entire portfolio into USD and anchor yields. And I feel like that's kind of, kind of ironic, right? It's kind of funny if you think about it and also kind of sad. But you know, let's, let's keep going, right? This is, I feel like this is how you should be thinking about the markets. Not like, oh, it's not gonna work, right? I feel like that's just completely, I feel like that's completely off because at the end of the day like market doesn't care about your feelings, right? Like you can write like a 20 Twitter, like 20 tweet thread about like how USN is not sustainable, how UST is not sustainable, but the markets don't care, right? Like markets are gonna move the way it's gonna move and our job is to predict that and make bets, manage risk and hopefully reap the rewards.
00:05:45.639 - 00:05:45.919, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:45.967 - 00:05:52.327, Speaker A: Market reward will reward those with critical thinking skills instead of people saying it's a Ponzi, not going to work.
00:05:52.391 - 00:05:53.047, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:53.231 - 00:06:00.799, Speaker A: Okay, so disclaimer. This is, my hypothesis could be wrong. I have a risk managed portfolio and I'm going to assume that the 20% is real.
00:06:00.847 - 00:06:01.023, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:01.039 - 00:06:12.291, Speaker A: So for the rest of the year I'm going to assume that's real. I think it is real. But you know, I'll just say that, you know, Just that's going to be the base assumption. Okay, let's talk about the USN narrative. So I think the USN narrative is.
00:06:12.323 - 00:06:13.371, Speaker B: Very, very important, right?
00:06:13.443 - 00:07:08.735, Speaker A: And I think the timing of the US on launch is very strategic from the near team's perspective, right? And you have to keep in mind that like, you know, like the near team, they've been working on this for a long time, right? I mean they're like a really well capitalized company. You know, they're not just like launching this as a fork, you know, to like pump their coin for like two weeks, right. They have a plan, right? Like, so if you think about it and like anchor yields, right? There's been a lot of FUD around Lunaust and how anchor yields have been subsidized and how it's going to go down. And like once it goes down, like what's going to happen, right? And you know, anchor yields adjusting is going to happen on May 1st. So anchor earn is going to have dynamic earn rate where if the anchor yield reserve is declining, then at the beginning of the month anchor yields can go down by 1.5%. And you know, if the anchor yield reserves are going up, then it can go up 1.5%.
00:07:08.775 - 00:07:08.927, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:08.951 - 00:07:17.463, Speaker A: So it's going to be dynamically adjusting at the first of every month. So I think it's fair to assume that on May 1st the anchor rates are likely dropping to 18%.
00:07:17.519 - 00:07:17.711, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:17.743 - 00:07:37.379, Speaker A: Because right now it's 19.5 and with the dynamic earn rates, it's probably dropping to 18%. So you know, with us and launching on let's say 420 and anchor rates dropping to 18%, what do you think is going to happen to the narrative? What do you think is going to happen to people on Twitter, social media about like, you know, like what do you think people will be talking about?
00:07:37.427 - 00:07:37.659, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:37.707 - 00:08:14.799, Speaker A: And this is me kind of predicting what people are going to say in the future, how people are going to manage their capital in the future and then allocating my portfolio, you know, in accordance to that, right. I think 20% is, I mean USD has approved that 20% is very attractive. And you know, I mean, you can look at the lunar chart, right? It's literally up only. And I think, you know, similarly, even though people aren't going to like usn, right? You know, they're not going to like it. But I think it is going to kickstart a new narrative. Assuming that, you know, like Bitcoin isn't nuking to like 25k or something, you know, how Strong is it going to be? That's the question. I have no idea.
00:08:14.799 - 00:08:41.869, Speaker A: I'm only here to hypothesize. So one thing you should understand is that you know, USN isn't going to be the same mechanics as ust. USN is going to be over collateralized to begin with. It's not going to be you know, like ust. It's kind of, it's going to be like similar mechanics to WAVES and usdn. I have a video on WAVES in USDN that I made like a couple weeks ago if you're interested. So what how USN is going to be, it's going to be over collateralized to begin with.
00:08:41.869 - 00:09:28.801, Speaker A: It's, you know, I'll talk about the yields too. And if you think about who's backing near, right? Who's going to be helping like I guess the NEAR team, like manage the USN peg. You can simply look at the backers and the operators that the NEAR ecosystem has. If you look at the Luna and USC ecosystem, who backs them? Well, it's JUMP crypto, right? Like one of the largest market makers in crypto and three arrows capital, which is like one of the bigger like VCs I guess in the crypto space. And they all have a vested interest in making sure that USC is not going to like lose its peg. Similarly, NEAR also has investors in JUMP Crypto and Three Arrows Capital. So, so you can bet that you know, both jump and 3ac is going to have a vested interest in making sure that USN isn't going to lose peg, right? At least in the short term.
00:09:28.801 - 00:10:17.561, Speaker A: Right? That's the key in the short term. I'm not talking about like what the future of USN is going to be like when I'm 60 years old. I'm talking about in the near term. Okay? And with like, with how like well capitalized the NEAR ecosystem is, right? I mean they raised like half a billion dollars in the last couple of months right through Tiger Global. I mean all these VCs and because of the over collateralization, because of the backing, because of the strength of the team, I think USN is going to be considered safe and I think the 20% yield is going to be considered safe in the short term. Okay? With those assumptions, I think TVL for USN or at least the market cap for USN is going to grow. And also whenever you see like super high TBL for new projects, you can assume that, you know, there are like VCs seeding liquidity to create more confidence for you know, like particular protocols.
00:10:17.593 - 00:10:17.809, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:17.857 - 00:10:18.761, Speaker A: This is what happens in crypto.
00:10:18.793 - 00:10:18.937, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:18.961 - 00:10:42.945, Speaker A: I mean just like laying it out there and I'm not really sure where the like 20% yield comes from. My hypothesis is it's going to be similar to that of waves. So the near staking yield right now is roughly 10%. So if USN starts out 2x over collateralized, it can offer 20%. And even if it's not 2x over collateralized, you know, they can subsidize those yields similarly to how like UST is subsidizing yields.
00:10:42.985 - 00:10:43.371, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:43.473 - 00:11:06.527, Speaker A: I mean this is just a marketing spend for these ecosystems to gain tbl, create more confidence in the ecosystem, its stablecoin, et cetera. Okay. And I'm sure this is triggering emotional responses from like you know, various people right now. But you know, the important thing is like to not be emotional and think about what's going to happen when this thing launches. Yeah, suck it up if it hurts your feelings. To be honest, the market doesn't care. I don't care.
00:11:06.527 - 00:11:19.701, Speaker A: No one really cares. Right. Like only you care. And you know like you can, you know, you can share, you can, you can be like this on Twitter, YouTube all you want but at the end of the day like markets are going to be markets and like we're going to move, we're going to move on like you know, past you.
00:11:19.733 - 00:11:19.853, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:19.869 - 00:11:32.437, Speaker A: Like we're going to forget about you. So you know, I think the important thing to realize here that a lot of people with very basic takes are having is that I don't think USC and USN are competing for the same market.
00:11:32.541 - 00:11:32.781, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:32.813 - 00:11:34.261, Speaker A: If you're just looking at the surface level.
00:11:34.333 - 00:11:34.685, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:34.765 - 00:11:53.327, Speaker A: Like algo stable coin that offers 20% yield. Sure. Like you know, if you think about it like anyone with like, you know, like 80 IQ can say yeah, like oh, like you know, they're competing. But if you think about like what the goals of USN and USC is, I don't think they're really going for the same market.
00:11:53.431 - 00:11:54.075, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:54.695 - 00:12:02.103, Speaker A: From near's perspective, I think they just want a NEAR state like NEAR native stablecoin that's gonna have some value accrual to near.
00:12:02.239 - 00:12:02.559, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:02.607 - 00:12:05.835, Speaker A: Instead of like having like usdc, USDT and die.
00:12:05.915 - 00:12:06.419, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:06.547 - 00:12:08.635, Speaker A: I think that's like where the NEAR team comes from.
00:12:08.675 - 00:12:08.827, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:08.851 - 00:12:16.051, Speaker A: They're just trying to create a NEAR native stable point. What's wrong with that? They're not trying to create a trillion dollar asset that like USD is trying to go.
00:12:16.083 - 00:12:16.251, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:16.283 - 00:12:29.355, Speaker A: Like I think the NEAR team is going to be completely Happy with us and being, you know, a multibillion dollar, right. Maybe $10 billion stablecoin, right? Like maybe like 12 months from now that's going to be very liquid in the NEAR ecosystem. Like, what's wrong with that?
00:12:29.395 - 00:12:29.571, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:29.603 - 00:14:02.985, Speaker A: Like they're not going for the same market. And if you think they're going for the same market, then that's where your logic is flawed and they're going for the same market, then you know, that's probably triggering an emotional response if you're like a Luna Maxi, for example. Because I think UST and Luna has done a great job, right? I mean, I've been covering the Luna ecosystem, the Terra ecosystem since July of last year, right? So, you know, like, I like to think that I know what I'm talking about, right? Like with Bitcoin Miami, right? Michael Saylor was literally talking about like Luna and USD, right? And he's like, oh yeah, like hardest money on earth backed, you know, backing a digital stable coin. It's a trillion dollar opportunity, right? I mean, you know, you know, I think DO Kwon has done a great job with like marketing like brand awareness with Luna and ust also with like other partnerships with, you know, like Avalanche, for example, you know, because a lot of people just assume that they're going for the same market, right? So they're like, oh yeah, it's not going to work. But you know, that's probably not the right way to think about this, right? Not the right way. And you know, there's been chatters, right? Like, is this going to be like the new own fork, right? Like alcohol stable season, you know, and maybe, maybe so, like, who knows, right? I think it's a more sustainable one than like own forks, for example, right? Like, I mean, own forks, like it just like stares up an elevator down. And I think from a strategic perspective, I think it's pretty well done from like the new, from like the NEAR team, right? The launch timing and offering subsidized stable yields in a treacherous macro environment, right? Like, what do you think is going to happen? My hypothesis is that it's going to bring more TVL into the NEAR ecosystem.
00:14:02.985 - 00:14:45.365, Speaker A: And you know, I also encourage everyone to listen to this, right? You know Jose from Delphi Digital, right. Backing Terra and Jordy that I guess like Jose, Jose was like the bull for USD and Jordy was like the bear in USD, right? And you know, this is like a two hour conversation. I recommend everyone watch it because I do agree with both Jordi and Jose when it comes to the risks and the potential upside of USD. And one thing that you know, people don't realize is that Jordi, even though he was a bear, right? He was like the Luna bear and he had questions about the longer term sustainability of Luna. He mentioned that he still had money on Anchor because he's like, okay, like thank you for the free yield, I'll take it.
00:14:45.445 - 00:14:45.757, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:45.821 - 00:15:53.665, Speaker A: And I feel like that's how like, that's why people are like Jordy are successful in the markets because they have a bias, they have their own opinions. But you know, if they see a market opportunity in the short term, even if it doesn't need to go along with their long term views, they're still going to extract value from like the Anchor yield reserves in the short term, right? Like you don't have to believe in ust like 10 years from now to put your stables into Anchor, right? Like I'm not saying put all your stables into Anchor, you know, I feel like there's like too much risk in that, right? Even though I do like Luna and ust. But like, you know, at least I don't know, like a third of your stables on Anchor, right? Like from a risk adjusted return basis. Like I'm sure that's pretty okay, right? Most people are too busy calling it a Ponzi and prefers not taking like the free money that you know, UST and Anchor are offering, right? And if you just like thought about it this way, then of course Luna was going to go up in the past six months, right? No, like it's, it's simple economics. Evgeny, right? He's from Proximity Labs, the defi incubator for the NEAR ecosystem, right. And he retweeted this ref finance, which is the AMM on near native on testnet had USN on. And I think USN is real.
00:15:53.665 - 00:16:15.857, Speaker A: The 20% I'm not really sure on. But you know, USN is real for sure, right? So no putting it like I guess conclusion wise, right? Trying to summarize things, let's say the 20% are zero, right? And given the backing, right. Given the over collateralization to begin with, USN is going to offer safe 20% stablecoin yields. What do you think is going to happen?
00:16:15.961 - 00:16:16.369, Speaker B: Right?
00:16:16.457 - 00:16:44.445, Speaker A: Put your emotions aside. I think there's going to be demand for usn, right? Similarly to how there was demand for ust. Okay. So you know, I guess going, going back on like the reason why I sold Luna. Sold some Luna, right? I still hold like a bunch, you know, with I guess the competition for USD, like I Said they're not competing for the same market. However, there will be competition in the short term, right. You have to separate those things.
00:16:44.445 - 00:17:34.413, Speaker A: So I don't think people that have money on anchor are going to like you know, pay slippage bridge fees to bridge over their USD onto near for like 20%. Right? Like I have money on anchor even if it goes to 18%. Like I'm not going to like know bridge that to like, I don't know, like avalanche swap it for you. Like USDC bridge it to near swap that for you. Like I'm not gonna go through that mess, right? Because I mean 2% is like trivial. However, you know, given what I've laid out, you know, if like a trader has like a hundred thousand dollars and they want to put in the stable coins like previously, maybe a month, a month ago they would have put that into anchor. But maybe, you know, maybe that money is going to go to usn, right? I mean that's like, I feel like, I think that's logical, right? So I think this is short term headwinds for Luna and USD.
00:17:34.413 - 00:18:04.093, Speaker A: Like it doesn't change the long term fundamentals, but in the short term it creates headwinds. So you know, Luna Fighters will have a field day, right? I mean, you know, it's already happening. I'm comfortable betting on DO Quantum in the long term, right. Like I'm not like, I'm not a maxi in the sense that I think like I don't come with the mindset that like oh yeah, USD will for sure be a 10 trillion dollar asset in 50 years and you know, it's going to be. I don't really think that way. I just think of in the mindset of from a risk adjusted return basis, right. From a risk order perspective, I like betting on Luna.
00:18:04.093 - 00:18:07.525, Speaker A: I like having some of my funds on ust, you know, simple as that.
00:18:07.565 - 00:18:07.837, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:07.901 - 00:18:24.541, Speaker A: And that's worked out well for me in the past nine months. So I took the screenshot last week. So maybe it's going to be more bearish. I mean, I don't know. But I expect Luna to kind of trade sideways. I don't really expect pumps. Maybe it'll dump, I don't know.
00:18:24.573 - 00:18:24.885, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:24.965 - 00:18:29.389, Speaker A: To be honest, I have no idea. But you know, I just also.
00:18:29.517 - 00:18:29.853, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:29.909 - 00:18:48.007, Speaker A: Sorry if that hurts your feelings but you know, I think you know, Luna Do Kwon is going in the same. Is going in like a really good route when it comes to like how to handle their business and to gain adoption for UST, right. Because if near can do it. Like, why can't other L1s do it?
00:18:48.111 - 00:18:48.471, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:48.543 - 00:19:39.317, Speaker A: So to prevent that from happening, you know, Luna naturally is going to have partnerships with Avax, right? So, you know, maybe if the NEAR native stablecoin is usn, maybe the Avalanche native stablecoin would have been like, usa, right? Like, think about the memes, like usa, usa. That's probably not going to happen because the Luna Foundation Guard and AVA Labs have a partnership. They swapped assets and UST in the future is going to be partially backed by Avax, right? And similarly, you know, Do Kwon alluded to these partnerships moving forward, I think they're going to also hold Adam and Soul, you know, I guess, like in the Luna Foundation Guard and whatnot. So, you know, through these business development partnerships, I think they're, you know, going to dissuade these other L1s from creating, you know, native stable coins. But, you know, other L1s, like, there's nothing stopping them from creating these stable coins. You know, maybe what ends up happening is like, you know, NEAR is going to launch their own native stable coin. It'll do well.
00:19:39.317 - 00:20:10.865, Speaker A: And then two months later, some new L1 is going to launch a new stablecoin. They're going to offer like 24% yield, and maybe that's going to be some crazy season. You know, it's like stablecoin farmers are going to have a field day and whatnot. But, you know, who knows? Like, we'll see when that happens. I also took the screenshot, but, you know, you can kind of see that the Luna burn rate is kind of decreasing. So, you know, headwinds, tailwinds are decreasing. So, you know, I just took some risk off, right? I mean, it's all about managing risk for me, right? Like, I didn't sell the top, but I don't care, right? I caught the medium move.
00:20:10.865 - 00:21:01.155, Speaker A: I still own, like, Luna, right? I still own it, right? It is what it is. But, you know, just wanted to take risk off the portfolio. But I'm still like, bullish like Luna, right? Because what did I do? I sold Luna to buy USD, right? So I still believe in the system, but, you know, I don't believe that I was taking the right amount of risk given, you know, these narratives forming. So my base case, what I expect, let's say in the next couple of months, right? I don't want to offer a timeline because I don't know and I'm making many assumptions here. However, my base case is that U.S. senate will grow big to a multibillion dollar stable Coin people are going to get angry, right? They're going to be, you know, like people are going to be angry and I think I'm going to like, you know, collect some profits off of that, right? That's my base case. I mean I'm positioned for it, right? I've been positioned this way for the last couple of months.
00:21:01.155 - 00:21:45.151, Speaker A: For better or for worse. Assuming that market doesn't rock CPI number coming tomorrow, right. You know, so maybe people are de risking into this event. Who knows, right? I can't predict. At the end of the day I'm like some dude on the Internet trading magic Internet coins. Like I'm not gonna predict like I'm not gonna time like these inflation prints and whatnot. But you know, something to watch, right? In terms like you know, all volatility, right? And where does like my multi billion dollar case like market cap case come from? Well if usdn, right from WAVES ecosystem can hit a billion dollar market cap and you know how, you know how kind of murky the waters are there, I just can do much better than that, right? I mean they're much better capitalized, they have better execution like in the terms of like having better operators, right.
00:21:45.151 - 00:21:50.719, Speaker A: With jump crypto whatnot and like no offense to the WAVES team, but I think the NIER team are a much stronger team.
00:21:50.847 - 00:21:51.135, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:51.175 - 00:22:29.657, Speaker A: And this is, I took this screenshot last week too. But you know, when I took the screenshot like they had a market cap of $1 billion, right? I mean, I mean crazy stuff, crazy stuff. So if USDN can hit a billion then like usn, I think it can be over a billion dollar, a multi billion dollar stablecoin, right? Like why not? Huge risk is that the 20% isn't real and it's lower. So like I said, my assumption is that the 20% is real. But we'll see, we'll see how it goes, right? And you know I am bullish. Near as I've mentioned, I'm positioned right. Like you know, I, I either die by the sword or I live by the sword.
00:22:29.657 - 00:22:43.325, Speaker A: I'm positioned right. And just because I'm bullish doesn't mean like my entire net worth is in here, right? Like you know, like it's, it's a risk management position. But I'm bullish. We'll see how it goes. We'll see how it goes. I think that's the end. That's the end.
00:22:43.325 - 00:23:06.491, Speaker A: So in terms of, was it in terms of narratives, I kind of changed it up a little bit here, right? So E 2.0 emerge. I kind of lowered it to light tailwinds because, you know, I don't even know if it's going to happen in Q3 anymore. I'm kind of in tracking it. But I think, you know, people used to say like, oh, yeah, June or July, and now they're saying sometime in 2022. So that kind of worries me.
00:23:06.523 - 00:23:06.691, Speaker B: Right?
00:23:06.723 - 00:23:18.455, Speaker A: That kind of worries me. Even though I do think the merge is not Christian and it's going to be bullish. Light tailwind usn as anchor rates go down in May, this could also be a heavy tailwind. I don't. I don't know, actually. But, you know, this. This is dynamic here.
00:23:18.455 - 00:23:39.055, Speaker A: This used to be a heavy tailwind, but, you know, even though they've been buying, like, no one really cares, right? I mean, it's kind of crazy how narratives work in crypto. And I expected this narrative to be, like, much stronger. But macro is just too treacherous right now. And light headwind, you know, anchor rates lowering. You know, this is. It is what it is. Still bullish, Luna, right? I believe.
00:23:39.055 - 00:24:05.285, Speaker A: I hope USD does well. But, you know, this also Luna, for those reasons last week. So that's going to be the conclusion of the video. Hopefully this video is useful. The markets are pretty treacherous, right? I mean, everything is red, right? It's pretty sad. Near is green. But, you know, even though I do think that near has a bunch of fundamentals, a bunch of catalysts that are not priced in properly, if the entire market's nuke, then nothing is stopping near from nuking.
00:24:05.285 - 00:24:37.839, Speaker A: So always manage your risk. Always manage your portfolio. Not financial advice. It's your money, right? I'm not telling you to do anything. I'm just sharing my research, my thesis, and, you know, who knows? Either near dumps, right? And I look dumb, that's fine. I'm taking on that risk, right, by making these videos. Or near like, goes up and I'm like, yeah, like, you know, those flutters, right? I mean, like, proved you wrong, right? I mean, do your damn research, right? I feel like a lot of people, they just like, look at the surface and like, have, like, shape their opinions.
00:24:37.839 - 00:25:01.801, Speaker A: But, you know, like, if you just put in. If you. If you, like, put in as much work as me, right, Like a lot of other quality analysts, you know, there's a lot of edge to. There's a lot of edge to be had in crypto if you just put in the time instead of like, just, you know, blindly following, like, whatever you see in the headlines. Okay, thank you guys for watching. Hopefully this video is useful. Let me know what your thoughts are.
00:25:01.801 - 00:25:17.025, Speaker A: Right. What do you think about USN USD? Yeah, I mean, yeah, the markets look like absolute poo poo. Absolute. You know, my chips are on the table. We'll see how it goes. Thank you guys for watching and have fun farming out there.
