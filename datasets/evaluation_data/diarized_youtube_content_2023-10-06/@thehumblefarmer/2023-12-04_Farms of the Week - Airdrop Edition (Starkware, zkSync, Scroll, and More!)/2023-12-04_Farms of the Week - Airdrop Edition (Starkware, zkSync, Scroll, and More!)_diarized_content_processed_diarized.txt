00:00:01.160 - 00:00:16.886, Speaker A: What is up guys? Humble farmer taiki here. And welcome to this week's edition of Farms of the week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. And check out the premium discord link will be in the description below. So I'm traveling. That's why I don't have my rake with me. I thought that airport security would probably think I'm bringing on a weapon.
00:00:16.886 - 00:00:40.360, Speaker A: Little do they know that I'm just a humble farmer, but I was able to bring my farmer hat. That's why it's a little indented. I had to fit it in my suitcase. But that is how dedicated I am to my craft. But anyways, I want this episode to be focused on l two airdrop farming. Just because a couple days ago this screenshot was leaked. It wasn't really a leak and it doesn't look real just because there's some typos here and whatnot.
00:00:40.360 - 00:00:51.928, Speaker A: But following people after this screenshot was circulating on Twitter, the starknet team basically came out and said, I mean, this is a bunch of mumbo jumbo. Didn't really say anything aside from the.
00:00:51.944 - 00:00:53.522, Speaker B: Fact that know, like we do, we.
00:00:53.546 - 00:01:34.266, Speaker A: Are going to have a token. We are working on our airdrop eligibility factors and whatnot and stay tuned basically, right? It's like, you know, like screw it. But I do think that we are at the point in the cycle where in the next couple of months, let's say two to twelve months, we're going to see a bunch of tokens just start to airdrop this for a few reasons. So first of all, I mean, obviously at some point they do have to do an airdrop. And we've also seen this trend. Various projects like Pith network and Celestia do their airdrops and both of these airdrops have done pretty well. If you look at the price of Celestia, I mean it's, I think it like launched like two $3 and now it's like up only, right? Same goes for pith.
00:01:34.266 - 00:01:37.350, Speaker A: I mean, it kind of went up only and then now it's like kind of consolidating.
00:01:38.170 - 00:01:39.770, Speaker B: But if you, you kind of have.
00:01:39.770 - 00:02:30.180, Speaker A: To think about the incentives from the team and the investors because the team, they've been working on this for a couple of years and investors, they want to cash out. And if you look at all the tokenomics of most projects in crypto, it kind of looks like this, where there's a one year cliff and then there's a three to four year vesting period. So if the team and investors believe that we're going to enter better market conditions in, let's say, in the next twelve to 24 months, then it would make sense for them to drop a token now, because twelve months later, let's say December of 2024, their tokens are going to start to become liquid. Maybe bitcoins are going to be all time highs. Ethereum is pumping. Maybe there's more animal spirits, more people interested in crypto, and there's going to be ample liquidity for people to cash out. Of course, this is a cynical view when it comes to crypto, but I do think that teams should get paid.
00:02:30.180 - 00:03:05.816, Speaker A: They're working on this stuff. They're trying to build infrastructure and whatnot. And it makes more sense to drop a token now and then start to think about selling the other tokens in 2025 or so. So for that reason, I do think that next year we're going to see a bunch of l two tokens get airdropped. 2021. I talked about the alt l one rotation, and I guess, you know, I got kind of known for that. But I do think that maybe next year 2025, we're going to start to see all these tokens drop, and maybe these l two s are going to incentivize their ecosystem through farming emissions and whatnot.
00:03:05.816 - 00:03:48.968, Speaker A: So I think as humble farmers we should plan for our future selves, right? We want to be in a situation where, let's say, twelve months from now be like, you know what, past psyche. I'm so proud of you, right? I'm so proud that, you know, Taiki, twelve months ago was farming this shit, right? And you also want to think about your future self, right? Like at the end of the day we all want to, you know, make money. We all want some form of financial independence, passive income, whatever it is. And we want to set our future self for that. Because if we get a bunch of airdrops twelve months from now, then we can sell it for cash, ether or whatever, you know, enter some farms. Then, you know, maybe the passive income meme will actually be a thing. So let's first talk about the Starknet starquare, this token, to be honest.
00:03:48.968 - 00:03:52.760, Speaker A: Okay, let's first talk about the ecosystem. I will be honest. The ecosystem sucks ass.
00:03:52.800 - 00:03:53.032, Speaker B: Okay?
00:03:53.056 - 00:04:34.950, Speaker A: Like I've used this ecosystem. It's literally trash just being honest here. Maybe it'll get better in the future. And my mindset typically for these l two s is that are they really going to airdrop their token when the ecosystem is dead? If you look at the arbitrum ecosystem, they did the airdrop in March of this year, and that was following their ecosystem. I mean, their ecosystem is pretty legit, right? Since early 2021 ish, there's a bunch of applications, people use it, and at that point it makes sense to reward the users know that used arbitrum. So does Starknet really want to do an airdrop right now? Because, I mean, if you look at, like, these apps, I mean, I lp'd for Jediswap.
00:04:34.990 - 00:04:36.334, Speaker B: I bridged like $50 over.
00:04:36.422 - 00:04:57.274, Speaker A: I sold half my ETH for USDC, and it took like ten minutes for my transactions to go through. I mean, it was an awful experience. But hey, you know, like, maybe I'm eligible for the airdrop, but I do. If you want to check it out, maybe Jediswap is good. Ikubo, the number four. This could be interesting. They are VC backed and whatnot.
00:04:57.274 - 00:05:22.788, Speaker A: I think whenever you're airdrop farming, I think it's better to avoid rugs or try to avoid, avoid rugs and only enter projects with some form of a VC backing. I know it's less degen, I know it's less exciting, but if you're in the game to airdrop farm, you just want to bridge some funds over, just, you know, enter applications, funds that you're willing to lose and just hope that, you know, twelve months from now you.
00:05:22.804 - 00:05:24.164, Speaker B: Will be rewarded to do so.
00:05:24.332 - 00:06:01.078, Speaker A: And I'll talk about other l two s. If you want to bridge to these ecosystems, I recommend orbiter. There's also, I mean, I do think that people should use each native bridge. For example, if you're bridging to Starknet, you should probably use their main bridge. But, you know, their main bridge is from Mainnet, Ethereum, and gas costs have been pretty high just because the market's been pumping recently and there's a lot of demand for block space. But if you want to bridge from, let's say, an l two to l two, I think orbiter is pretty good. You can go from, let's say, optimism to, I mean, you know, I'll talk about scroll later, but, you know, you can technically bridge from optimism to scroll.
00:06:01.078 - 00:06:23.170, Speaker A: So give some options. So actually, let's talk about scroll first. So this is another l two. There's too many l two s. To be honest. I think there's this phenomenon in crypto where VC's have so much money they don't really know what to fund. And instead of funding applications, they just back infrastructure like layer one l two s, and they just launch at absurd valuations.
00:06:23.170 - 00:06:48.170, Speaker A: Yeah, there's too much block space, not enough applications. But that's a topic for a whole other video. So it's another l two, they don't have a token. They probably have a token. And if you want to farm this, you can go to look at these applications and whatnot. But I think farming ambient number four, I think this is interesting ambient. Their Dex is going to be built into parachain and they recently raised $6.5
00:06:48.170 - 00:07:10.962, Speaker A: million. This was announced July of 2023. It's got some decent names. I think it was around a $60 to $80 million valuation that they raised that. And you can do a double whammy. You can bridge the scroll, maybe hit some checkboxes, and then you can lp for ambient and then maybe be eligible for an airdrop. I haven't done this yet.
00:07:10.962 - 00:07:39.596, Speaker A: I actually lp'd on Ambient on Mainnet. I don't do it anymore because I, you know, for various reasons, but you know, like bridging the scroll, forming the ambient airdrop and the scroll drop might make sense. We also wrote a thread on this on ambient, so I'll also provide this in the description below in case you want to actually learn about the tech and what makes this different from other dexs, because there are also so many dexs. Zksync is also another good candidate for airdrop farming. It's an l two.
00:07:39.668 - 00:07:41.748, Speaker B: It's actually got a pretty respectable amount.
00:07:41.764 - 00:08:02.194, Speaker A: Of TVL at 160. Not great, but respectable. Their top TVL Dex is sync swap, which I think is okay. They're on multiple ecosystems, they've been around for a long time. They don't have a token either. So it might be good to double whammy airdrop farm. But I do want to bring your attention to Maverick protocol, just because I do think the tech is semi interesting.
00:08:02.194 - 00:08:54.790, Speaker A: They did their token launch on binance like the launchpad, so I'm not sure how much upside there is in the token. But if you look at their Dex, this is on Zksync, but it's got 8 million TVL. And you look at these rates, USDC eight pair paying 100 to basically triple digit APR, and what difference does Maverick have relative to, let's say, uniswap? And they have these things called modes, and I'm only going to talk about mode right and mode left, just so you kind of get a gauge on how this works. But from a retail LP perspective on a cheap chain, I do think that this does add some value. So, you know, the problem with providing liquidity is that you have to set a range for yourself. You're basically, you know, making a bet that I think either price is going to be between 2000 and $2500. And as long as it's within that range, I'm going to make fees and money, essentially.
00:08:54.790 - 00:09:31.838, Speaker A: But how the hell am I supposed to know? Okay, like, I don't know where price is going to go. And if there's a way to automate where liquidity moves, maybe that's useful. So mode, right, if you deposit liquidity into a pool, the liquidity will only follow the market price to the right. So if market goes up, then it'll follow the liquidity. So if you're bullish, then maybe it makes sense to enter mode, right? And as price moves, you're, you know, this, providing liquidity for higher and higher ranges. Therefore you're more concentrated, you're making more fees, higher APR. Similarly, you can do mode left, where if you deposit liquidity into the pool and price goes down, it'll follow that liquidity.
00:09:31.838 - 00:09:43.102, Speaker A: So, you know, this is better than, let's say, providing full range liquidity because you're just getting better rates. Of course, there is impermanent loss and whatnot, but whenever I talk about airdrop farming, I really don't think you should.
00:09:43.126 - 00:09:47.830, Speaker B: Be depositing that much capital into these applications. And what I would suggest is maybe.
00:09:47.950 - 00:10:00.714, Speaker A: Open like five to ten wallets, you know, this bridge across all these wallets, maybe enter a few dollars, whatever makes sense for you, and hope. Pray to the airdrop gods that you'll be rewarded.
00:10:00.842 - 00:10:26.652, Speaker B: That's kind of what happened to me with arbitram. I had six wallets. I just used a bunch of arbitram applications over a long period of time, and I got a bunch of tokens like $30,000 worth in six accounts. And I just market dumped that shit immediately. I'm like, okay, bam, I'm out of here. Okay. I mean, not, I didn't do it immediately, but, you know, I waited a few weeks, but generally with these airdrops, I just want to stack more eth.
00:10:26.652 - 00:10:28.308, Speaker B: I kind of view these airdrops as.
00:10:28.324 - 00:10:31.212, Speaker A: A way to accumulate more ether, let's say.
00:10:31.396 - 00:10:38.988, Speaker B: So, you know, Maverick is pretty cool. There's also like mode both, which moves liquidity both ways. And there's a mode static, which is.
00:10:39.084 - 00:10:40.172, Speaker A: Basically a full range liquidity.
00:10:40.196 - 00:11:07.194, Speaker B: But, you know, it's, I think it's pretty interesting, but starkware, I think it's cool. Zksync scroll. There's a lot of opportunities. Last one to talk about is Linia. I haven't bridged Linia, the TVL has been growing pretty steadily. There's a bunch of these, you know, sync swap everywhere, right? So maybe sync swap is pretty interesting as an airdrop farm, because maybe they're gonna be this l two cross chain Dex. I'm not really bullish that type of narrative, but, you know, maybe there's something there.
00:11:07.194 - 00:11:58.050, Speaker B: Mendy finance I've never heard of. I'm at the point where maybe I'm too humble nowadays, but if I'm entering a lending protocol, it's really hard for me to deposit any capital in size aside from Aave. But like I said, if you're only depositing chump change into these applications, then maybe that doesn't really matter. Maybe you can get some airdrops along the way. But I do think it makes sense to start thinking about airdrop farming l two s, because, like, in my experience, it's like as soon as, for example, once the arbitrary airdrop happened, everyone was asking me, like, how do I airdrop farm? Okay, like, that's probably the wrong way to think about airdrop farming. You want to get ahead of it, okay? You want to be farming these things before the airdrop actually happens, because once it happens, you can't do anything. Okay? It happened.
00:11:58.050 - 00:12:26.396, Speaker B: And I think crypto is kind of cool in a sense, where during the bear market, during a boring market, there's not much to do. But the system, the entire economy, right? The crypto economy has a way of rewarding people that stick around, and I think that's kind of cool. It also creates wealth within the ecosystem. And I know people get angry about VC's and teams dumping and whatnot, but teams and investors, they fund these projects. We get tokens, we dump it.
00:12:26.468 - 00:12:27.476, Speaker A: Can we really complain?
00:12:27.588 - 00:12:56.250, Speaker B: We get free money. Know it. Yeah, like, you know, this is how the world works. Okay, so, anyways, last thing I'll talk about, you know, I've been talking about Kanto a lot, but I do think that farming Kanto is pretty interesting. It's one of the projects that I'm currently, like, pretty bullish on. And, you know, you don't even have to buy the token, right? Like, you can LP for CnodUsDC, you know, ping 24% node, USDC, and note is an over collateralized stable coin. So, you know, it's actually over collateralized.
00:12:56.250 - 00:13:18.946, Speaker B: So, you know, there isn't that much dpeg risk. And, you know, if you like, I guess, the native asset, you can introduce pool twos like Kanto Adam Kanto eat canto note, you know, I'm famous for having this Netflix documentary of the Kanto video, Kanto videos and nobody watches. But you know, I kind of have it have a good time doing it because I think it's kind of fun.
00:13:19.058 - 00:13:33.234, Speaker A: So lastly, I'll talk about arbitrum short term incentives program where the arbitrum dao is giving away ARB tokens to various defi applications. And you know, there are some juicy farming opportunities. We've talked about them in other episodes of farmers of the week, so I'm.
00:13:33.242 - 00:13:39.194, Speaker B: Not going to spend too much time on it. Check out the playlist. But you know Pendle, they're incentivizing liquidity.
00:13:39.242 - 00:13:41.270, Speaker A: Camelot is incentivizing liquidity.
00:13:41.650 - 00:13:46.230, Speaker B: You know, Stella Finance, perennial GMX.
00:13:48.090 - 00:13:48.490, Speaker A: Mux.
00:13:48.530 - 00:13:53.476, Speaker B: Protocol, silo finance trader Joe. So I do think that the best.
00:13:53.548 - 00:14:20.216, Speaker A: Farms on paper is going to be on arbitrary. But I also think it's worth considering these other l two ecosystems like Zksync, like Scroll, because I think there are opportunities to double dip aerodrop farm. In the case of scroll, you can do scroll and ambient double whammy. Kill two birds with 1 st. I think it makes sense. But yeah. For more farms of the week, make sure to like and subscribe this video.
