00:00:00.280 - 00:00:36.952, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here. And in this video I want to discuss what the hell this thing is the a tri crypto pool on curve finance and whether this is a good yield or opportunity for you to park your capital. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Alright, so they, so curve launched this two days ago on June 9, coinciding with the launch of Curve V two, where they're launching an algorithm for exchanging volatile assets. Why is this important? Well, Curve originally was a decentralized exchange that specialized in swapping between, like, assets, for example, USDC to dai, dai to tether. Right, stable coins.
00:00:36.952 - 00:01:16.692, Speaker A: Same goes for wrapped bitcoin to REM bitcoin. Right. And they didn't really allow for the swapping from like, USDC to bitcoin until now. And they're competing with uniswap V three, I think. And they, with this launch, they also released this paper and I don't think anyone really understands this, right? It's just a bunch of graphs and math equations that no one can wrap their head around. And there's a good thread by Mister Hoddle kryptonite agent trading that goes over his takes. And essentially they're, I think, from like a 90 IQ perspective, right, from my perspective, they're, they're introducing constant concentrated liquidity, which is similar to what Unisol V three is doing.
00:01:16.692 - 00:02:09.584, Speaker A: So I'm not going to argue about the technology, why it's better, why it's not better. Like, I'll let the beta males on crypto Twitter figure that shit out for me as a farmer, putting my farmer hat on. Like, what I'm thinking about is, okay, given the yields, what are the risks? And with those factors, is it better than the other opportunities that curve polygon is giving me? Right? So let me go over, like, a more mathematical approach to do this. So initially, I did not understand what this thing was. So I asked the community, like, anyone with, like, anyone with a bigger brain, tell me what, like, what's going on? And curve, whoever is running curve's Twitter deserves a raise. But he said that, or he or she said that, you know, this HRI crypto pool is similar to providing liquidity for the one third, one third, one three balancer pool. So essentially providing liquidity, 33% of stablecoins, 33% of ETH, and 33% of bitcoin.
00:02:09.584 - 00:02:44.612, Speaker A: Right? So you're providing liquidity to facilitate the swapping of these assets. And before I touch on the topic of impermanent loss. I have a video explaining what this thing is. I have a collaboration video with Benjamin Cohen. I'll provide this, I'll provide a link to this in the description below. But like, an overview of what impermanent loss is, is like when you provide liquidity and the price of one asset goes up relative to the other, the pool has to maintain an equal ratio of these two assets. So if it goes up, then the pool will sell the outperforming asset, buy more of the underperforming asset.
00:02:44.612 - 00:03:14.232, Speaker A: So it meets in the middle. Right. So when you provide liquidity, you always end up, I guess, owning more of the asset that underperforms and less of the asset that overperforms. So it's a little complicated with this one third, one third, one three ratio. But Mister Weeb here, where is he? Yeah, Mister Weeb here shared this tool. Well, his, his profile picture is very on brand. But anyways, he provided this tool here of like, what would be.
00:03:14.232 - 00:03:56.886, Speaker A: Let me just go back to zero here. Like, what would be the impermanent loss for this particular pool with this weight waiting, right? So let's say I'll do this for two scenarios because. And it's important to do this because you have to compare providing liquidity for this, a tribe crypto pool, to the providing liquidity to sushiswap, right. The bitcoin eth pool, because this pool is giving you 22% apY, whereas the atri crypto pool is giving you 10%. Right? So for you to park your money on this hyd crypto pool, like the rewards, has to be significantly much better for this than sushiswap. Because, I mean, if it's the same, then you should go to sushiswap. And if sushiswap is better, then you should obviously go to Sushiswap, right? From like a profit maximalization perspective.
00:03:56.886 - 00:04:37.398, Speaker A: So let's compare the impermanent loss in the case for this triple pool versus a dual pool. So let's take one scenario where bitcoin just goes to the moon. It goes up by 100%, right? So it doubles and ETH goes. ETH triples in value, right? In this case, you're going to end up owning more USDC and the impermanent loss will be 9.23%. Okay, so what happens on sushi? So let's say right now, bitcoins about roughly 36k. ETH is 24k. So let's say you're providing liquidity on Sushiswap and bitcoin doubles in price, right? To 72,000 and ETH goes to 7200.
00:04:37.398 - 00:05:03.050, Speaker A: Well, in this case, the impermanent loss is 2%. Okay, so you can already see that. Okay, if bitcoin and ETH goes up, then I'm better off providing liquidity for sushiswap. But what if it goes down, right? So let's say bitcoin goes down 25% and ETH goes down 50%, right? Don't be mad at me, Eth. Maxis, this is an example. In this case, the improvement and loss is roughly 4%. Let's compare that to this example with Sushiswap.
00:05:03.050 - 00:05:52.734, Speaker A: So if bitcoin goes down 25%, it goes to 27,000. But if it dumps 50%, then it goes to 1200. Right? Well, in this case, the impermanent loss is also 2%, which is much better than 4%. So just looking at the data, right, does it make sense for you to park your money in here when you're exposing yourself to more impermanent loss risk? Well, as the lower base APY compared to sushiswap, which gives you less implement loss risk and higher APY. Well, for me personally, like, if I. If I had to choose between the two, I would just go with Sushiswap for those reasons. And, and like, I don't want to knock on this particular pool because it's, I mean, 10% is still really, really high, right? It's just like not as high compared to the, I guess this pool with the stable coins and the sushi pool.
00:05:52.734 - 00:06:35.160, Speaker A: And that's primarily because of these liquidity mining programs. So for curve a polygon is allocating $5 million worth of matic to this particular pool, right? The dollar pool, right? Which is why you can earn 20% on your dollars. And for Sushiswap, there's a $30 million liquidity mining program where $15 million of matic is allocated and 15 milligrams of sushi is distributed to people that LP. And you can see it here, right? You're earning sushi and matic every day just by providing liquidity. So if it weren't for these liquidity mining rewards, perhaps it is. Perhaps this pool is really good, right? I mean, 10% is nothing to scoff at. However, given the other opportunities out there, there's too much opportunity cost.
00:06:35.160 - 00:06:48.480, Speaker A: And for me personally, it doesn't make sense to park my money on a tri crypto, if that makes sense. Thank you guys for watching.
