00:00:00.240 - 00:00:19.134, Speaker A: A few weeks ago, I started bull posting Uniswap, and a lot of people were confused. I didn't really understand why until I realized that a lot of you are idiots. So in this video, I'll dumb it down and give you three reasons on why I think Uniswap is gonna go up. Reason number one, CEO of Uniswap, Hayden Adams. Just look at him. What do you notice? Just look at him. Look at his face.
00:00:19.134 - 00:00:32.320, Speaker A: He's balding. He's balding. I think this is something that the market doesn't consider. I think the prerequisite for a founder to build a successful crypto exchange is to be bald. Right? Think about CZ Binance. Number one exchange. He's bald.
00:00:32.320 - 00:00:51.280, Speaker A: Cz's bald. Bnb up only really, really bullish. I know what you're thinking, but right now, the CEO of finance is Richard Tang. He has hair, but this is really, really bearish, right? Just look at the types of assets he's been listing. He's probably going to go to jail. The thing is, when people think about Binance, thinking of CZ, and CZ is bald, that's very, very bullish. Next, Coinbase.
00:00:51.280 - 00:01:04.524, Speaker A: I already know what you're thinking. Right? Come on, come on. Right? Brian Armstrong. Look at his head, right? That's like the baldest head that I've ever seen in my life. Really, really bullish. So I think Hayden understands this. A couple months ago, he was kind of posting on Twitter.
00:01:04.524 - 00:01:38.108, Speaker A: People have been calling him gay, right? He's like, oh, like, why are people so homophobic? This is not so great. Why don't people make fun of my hair instead? So I think he sees a light. I don't think he's capitulated on his hair yet, but I think the moment he capitulates is going to be one of the bullish moments in uniswap history. This is a huge catalyst that people are not considering. I think the Unisol token is going to have a pre bald regime and a bald regime. And I think the bald regime is going to turn out in hindsight, right? Like two, three, four years from now, it's like, oh, yeah. Like, you know, Wall street analysts will be saying, yeah, like, you know, when he shaved his head, that's when Uniswap decided to, like, put like a 30 x.
00:01:38.108 - 00:02:09.888, Speaker A: So, you know, reason number one, he's balding. Really, really bullish. Reason number two is that uniswap foundation is poor, right? They need money and they're going to pump their bags. So I took the liberty of looking at the unisoft Foundation Q two financials and apparently they're spending like $36 million in the next 1.5 years and they're going to run out of money by the end of the year or end of 2025. So first of all, why are they spending so much money, right? Like what's the reasons for some reckless spending? Reason number one, they know they're going to turn on a fee switch soon. So you know, it doesn't really matter, right? They're going to make some money, that's great.
00:02:09.888 - 00:02:37.386, Speaker A: Or they're fucking stupid. Now if they're fucking stupid, you know, I'm fucked, right? Like I bought a bunch of tokens, I'm fucked. But hopefully they're not fucking stupid and you know, they have reasons to turn on a fee switch and whatnot. Speaking of the fee switch, you know, they put that, put out this proposal February of 2024. This is really long. I didn't really want to read this, so I took the liberty of going to chat GPT and asking AI, hey, can you summarize this shift for me? This is very long. And AI decided to agree with me, which is really, really bullish, right? Hey Taiki, the Uniswap foundation is poor.
00:02:37.386 - 00:02:58.312, Speaker A: Haha. They need money. They're gonna pump their bags. So I mean, people think that this is gonna be the AI super cycle and if AI thinks that Uniswap is gonna go up, then obviously it's gonna go up. Reason number three on why I think Uniswap is going to go up is that, you know, the tokens are vested. So it's been four years since the Uniswap token airdrop. I mean, you know, happy, I guess, anniversary by the way.
00:02:58.312 - 00:03:43.730, Speaker A: But that also means that the advisors investors team, they've all got their tokens, right? And think about the VC's, look at them, right? This is one of the biggest VC's in Uniswap. Like for Uniswap a 16 z, they're fucking bald, right? They're gonna bald or they have balded their bald and they're gonna pump their bags, you know, and like last month, a 16 Z crypto, they put out this proposal, or they put out this blog post on how to generate cash flow for app tokens, aka how do we pump our bags? And I'll summarize it for you, right? So that, you know, you know, like dummies can understand. There's two ways to pump their bags. First is to create a chain, right? L two app, chain, whatever. Second is to say, fuck the sec, right? Like, fuck you, Gary Gensler. You're bald or you're balding, we're gonna go after you. So, you know, create a chain.
00:03:43.730 - 00:04:00.126, Speaker A: I mean, like, that's cool. I don't even know how this is gonna go, but, I mean, if they create a chain that's gonna pump our bags, that's great. Number two, if fuck the sec, I can get behind this, because Gary Gensler. I mean, no one really likes him. He hasn't capitulated on his hair yet. I don't even know how old he is. He's like 60 years old.
00:04:00.126 - 00:04:32.609, Speaker A: If you're 60, you're balding, you haven't shaved your head, then there's something wrong with you. So pretty bearish, right? Genzel is pretty bearish. But, you know, that's good, right? I mean, a six and z, right? Fuck the sac. And, you know, one of the authors for the article said that. Yeah, like, you know, securities laws. Like, fuck that shit, right? We're going to tell our portfolio companies to adopt the Duna standard, and then, you know, we can just flip the middle finger to Gary Gensler and then pump our bags. So what does it do now? I don't even know what this means, but apparently it came into effect July 1, 2024.
00:04:32.609 - 00:04:52.880, Speaker A: That's great. And then they kind of write a bunch of things, but the most important thing, I think, is that under the Doona, right? So if Uniswap or their portfolio companies adopt the Doona legal entity, their tokens are not securities, right. They're gonna. They can pump their bags. They can do whatever the fuck they want. And, you know, fuck your answer. That's kind of like the TLDR of this entire fiasco here.
00:04:52.880 - 00:05:16.844, Speaker A: So obviously, uni chain, if they do a unit chain, that's pretty bullish. If they do a fee switch, or like they say, fuck giganzilla, that's also bullish. The timeline, right? February, they put out this v switch proposal, unit pump from six to $17. May, async and Z stepped in to delay the vote. Not bald enough. We need Hayden to shave his head. It retraced all those gains.
00:05:16.844 - 00:05:39.864, Speaker A: July was when Duna was signed into law. And then last month is when they published an article on how to pump their bags. So it seems like the stars are aligning. The timeline makes sense if you look at, like, why they delayed the fees or proposal. The important word that they use is that they postponed it. So they're going to do it again at some point. And I have a feeling that they're going to do it relatively soon because the tokens are fully vested and Hayden is losing hair every single day.
00:05:39.864 - 00:06:06.834, Speaker A: And AI also agrees with me. So that's kind of the TLDR on why I think it's going to go up. But, like, you know, you might be asking yourself, you know, like, what if you're wrong, right? Tyke, you've showed so many bullshit before. They've all gone. They've all gone down. What if you're wrong? So, and I think for this part, I need to go full screen here so I can, you know, be more up close and personal. So, like, what if I'm wrong? Then I'll just pretend that this never happened.
00:06:06.834 - 00:06:33.390, Speaker A: I'm shameless. They're balding. I'm shameless. I'm shameless. I'm shameless. Close.
