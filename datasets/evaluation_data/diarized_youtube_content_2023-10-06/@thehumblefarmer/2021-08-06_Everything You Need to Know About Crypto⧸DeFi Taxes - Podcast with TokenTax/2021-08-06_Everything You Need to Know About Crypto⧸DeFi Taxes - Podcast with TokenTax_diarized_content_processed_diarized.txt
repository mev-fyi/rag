00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.010, Speaker A: Guys, taki here today. I'm very honored to invite Zach and author of Token Tax. Today we'll be discussing crypto defi taxes and answering any of the questions that I might have. So welcome on. And how are you guys doing today?
00:00:13.110 - 00:00:15.286, Speaker B: Thanks for having us. We're doing. I'm doing great.
00:00:15.358 - 00:00:16.570, Speaker C: Thank you for having us.
00:00:17.230 - 00:00:25.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So just as a quick introduction, before I start asking questions, how did token tags get started? And are you two Defi power users as well?
00:00:27.730 - 00:01:11.670, Speaker C: Yeah. So we got started back in 2017. Product hunt, Google hackathon. Google had a hackathon, and out of a thousand ideas or startups submitted, we ended up taking first place. So I'm one of the co founders, and when we submitted it back then, we ended up winning 100 grand and a bunch of other prizes. And we basically use that money to just bootstrap the first iteration of the product and launched it right after that, just started getting paying users, and we've bootstrapped it since then and just kind of grown every year, adding new functionality, adding new features, just sort of driven by what our users and customers want. That's how we got into DeFi.
00:01:11.670 - 00:02:04.606, Speaker C: A lot of the team are degenerates in the weeds, trying all the new protocols, farming when things come out, and so. But, you know, even earlier than that, before there was DeFi, you know, we knew some of the maker founders when margins started coming out, and a lot of other. A lot of cpas and people out there really didn't know what to do with people's crypto tax situations. So we were a resource for cpas accounting firms, as well as individual tax investors who are individual crypto investors who just needed to file their own tax returns. And so we kind of got our start in 2018. We were growing, growing as the market started to drop. We were helping people figure out how to track their tax loss in 2017, while the people made a lot of money and then ended up losing it.
00:02:04.606 - 00:03:08.974, Speaker C: And the way that accounting rules work in the US is some people ended up owing the IR's more in taxes than they actually had by the time they came and found us later in 2018 to figure it all out. So a lot of our company has to do with personal finance, teaching people about what's possible, what's allowed, what accounting methods even mean. What does it mean to track all the different times you bought Ethereum and so on? And so that's something that's really underpinned a lot of what we've developed. And then we were working with individuals originally, and then a lot of those people went on to start protocols, start companies, start funds in the space. And so we organically started working with businesses and llcs and corps and things like that as we've grown, just to support whatever our customers need on the tax and accounting and record keeping and just consulting advisory, both in the US and all over the world. We've got users in dozens of countries at this point. I think we've got tens of thousands of users all over the place.
00:03:08.974 - 00:03:25.140, Speaker C: And we're the engine under the hood for a lot of accounting firms and cpas, people that you see on Twitter, crypto cpas, crypto attorneys. They outsource a lot of the record generation, the 89 49, to us before filing for their clients. And we also file returns and everything as well.
00:03:25.640 - 00:03:32.352, Speaker A: I see. Thanks for answering. Yeah, good to know that, you know, your team is full of the agents, too, so that's where. So it's good to know that you know where we are.
00:03:32.376 - 00:03:54.972, Speaker C: Yeah, that's why. Yeah, that's why we're so far in the weeds and, you know, that's why we can anticipate. All right, this is what's going to be a really big problem next tax season. Luckily, taxes are a lagging indicator, so it's kind of like, all right, we need to sync BSE. We need to sync matic. All right, how do we. How do we get the blockchains done? How do we start pulling the right metadata? Luckily, we don't need it as much of real time as, you know, people trading on the exchanges.
00:03:54.972 - 00:04:06.348, Speaker C: So we have a little bit of time to follow up. But, yeah, certainly we know what's going on in the space as much as. As we can. As much as anyone.
00:04:06.524 - 00:04:26.404, Speaker A: Yeah. And I can imagine just keeping up with all the new ecosystems must be pretty difficult. Right? Because the. That, I guess earlier this year we had binance, smart chain, then Polygon, and then you have all these other blockchains like phantom Avalanche. And I'm sure your clients are, like, asking, hey, like, can I use products there? You use products there. I'm sure, you know, your team is working really, really hard, especially in a bull market.
00:04:26.452 - 00:04:26.612, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:26.636 - 00:04:31.972, Speaker A: Because I'm sure in a bear market, there's not that much demand for crypto taxes, but in a bull market, a bunch of new clients come in.
00:04:31.996 - 00:04:33.940, Speaker C: So it's a. Yeah, it absolutely flows.
00:04:34.060 - 00:04:34.612, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:04:34.636 - 00:05:16.810, Speaker C: And it changes. You know, in a bull market, it's, you know, people have money to pay for the expertise and the amount of time it takes to figure these out in a bear market people may have lost money, but we can help them get a chunk of that back from the IR's. A lot of people don't understand, hey, if you invested in something and lost money and you tracked your records, you actually submit that capital loss on your tax return and it shields even ordinary income and it rolls forward as a loss to shield other capital gains in the future or even ordinary income up to 3000 per year. So, you know, in other words, the IR's can subsidize some of your investment losses if you do things the right way, track your data and submit your tax returns.
00:05:17.550 - 00:05:57.548, Speaker A: I see, I see. Yeah. And I'll ask you later, I guess in this, according to, I guess, like, I guess, tax tricks that people can do, like whether it be like an LLC, things like that. But before I get into that, I just want to talk about common misconceptions between, I guess, Defi and I, I guess, taxes in general, because I see a lot of discussions on Twitter, social media, everywhere that people on the comments section saying, yeah, I'm not going to report my taxes because DeFi is, there's no KYC. Right. But do you want to clear up that misconception and how you can't actually hide from the IR's, especially with increased regulations coming in the next few years?
00:05:57.724 - 00:06:36.680, Speaker B: Yeah, there's definitely this idea, broader than Defi, even in the larger crypto community, that crypto is somehow completely anonymous and shielded. And that can be true to some extent. But the fact of the matter is that everything is on the blockchain. And so it's just a matter of time before the IR's. And they've already decided to, I think they put another 30 million into crypto enforcement for the coming fiscal year. It's just a matter of time before they figure out a, you know, how to basically, like, parse that information and how to get information. And there's been, you know, efforts, enforcement efforts in the past as well.
00:06:36.680 - 00:07:05.930, Speaker B: You know, back in 2018 with Coinbase and a couple of the other, like, major exchanges, getting IR's summons. I mean, DeFi is to some extent probably a little harder from an enforcement standpoint, but it's just a matter of time before they figure out how to do it and get the right people in the right places to be able to look up the data, which again, I mean, all of it's out there in the open. It's kind of the opposite of anonymous. Every transaction is a matter of public record. It's all out on the blockchain.
00:07:06.550 - 00:07:33.538, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Because I guess my feel on ramp to DeFi is a centralized exchange like coinbase and finance, and those entities tend to be regulated. And that means that IR's technically have whatever ETH address that I send funds to and they can just track whatever I'm doing. Then it's not really anonymous. Right. I guess the addresses themselves are anonymous, but it's not going to take that much effort to track it back to my name and et cetera.
00:07:33.594 - 00:07:44.270, Speaker B: Yeah, right. You take one step and once you figure out like one sort of link in the chain, like the rest of it is all sort of publicly available. So yeah, definitely a misconception.
00:07:45.610 - 00:08:33.604, Speaker C: And I mean, the IR's gave guidance in 2014, you know, kind of the only guidance they gave over a ten year period. Washington, all disposals, all sales of crypto have to be reported. So one really common misconception was, oh, I traded crypto to crypto. So I've only ever bought crypto. And it's like, no, if you sold bitcoin and bought ethereum, in other words, if you traded crypto to crypto, that is a taxable event and had to be reported. And so as you, as you mentioned, you know, when we see people get audited, they subpoena the data from all the centralized exchanges and we'll just see on the list like we need the data from this ETH, all these ETH addresses, they know exactly which centralized exchanges and just wallet addresses are connected to people's centralized exchanges. And they know, okay, you're on Bitfinex, you're on BitMex.
00:08:33.604 - 00:09:09.406, Speaker C: We need all this data. So we have clients all the time come in, they get the letters, they're getting audited and they're just surprised the IR's knows all this stuff. They are up to. Usually people who had never reported anything until they're getting audited, then they come to find us. So yeah, it's a really common misconception that people don't have to report anything in crypto or that people outside crypto think, oh, it's so anonymous, it's illicit activities, things like that. That's certainly not the case. But yeah, the biggest misconception I've heard over the years is people thinking crypto to crypto was not a taxable event.
00:09:09.406 - 00:09:34.120, Speaker C: And sometimes you'll hear people say, oh, there's three year statute of limitations, this and that. Well, if you didn't report anything, all they have to do is simply say, oh, suspected fraud, tax fraud. And they've, you know, they go all the way back. I saw one recently, like all the way back to 2009. So, you know, that that's another misconception people have. They think, oh, I didn't report from a couple years ago, so I'm good. And it's very obvious on the blockchain, you know, they get your coinbase account.
00:09:34.120 - 00:09:54.560, Speaker C: They see you went back to 2013 and didn't report anything. So it's good to get that tied away and squared away, especially as people start to have really material sums of money and they had no idea they had a reporting obligation. So once people figure that out and they start getting in compliance, it's just a big weight off of their shoulders and makes everything a lot smoother for them going forward.
00:09:55.180 - 00:10:26.392, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And my general motto is don't mess with IR's, so just try to report taxes. So going off a tangent of what you said, like crypto to crypto, I guess trades are taxable events. I had a question about, like, I guess taking, for example, bitcoin and turning it into rap bitcoin, right? Because technically I am taking a crypto and turning it into a new crypto, but it's the same thing, right? Bitcoin to bitcoin. Is that a taxable event or like, how does that essentially work?
00:10:26.576 - 00:11:08.894, Speaker B: So technically there's no like concrete guidance on this, just like everything else. Like, they definitely did not issue any. I mean, wrapping stuff didn't even come around for, you know, back when the IR's issued their initial guidance. I mean, this is like, it really depends on what you decide with your tax advisor. Technically, like you said, it's crypto to crypto and WBTC is a separate token than BTC. And so the most conservative answer is generally that that's going to be considered a taxable event. But there are different perspectives and if you can sort of like, you know, prove in like a facts and circumstances case that, like you didn't really, you know, realize or recognize any gain.
00:11:08.894 - 00:11:48.138, Speaker B: Like that kind of thing might fly under audit, it might not. I think the short answer is technically it is considered. It would be considered a taxable event. But, you know, what you decide to do and how you decide to treat that and, you know, at the end of the day, like, whether you consider it a taxable event or not, your total gains are sort of going to be the same in the long run, right? So, like, if you, let's say you, you know, you buy BTC at 100, you wrap it. Sorry, let's say 10,000, you wrap it at 15,000. There's like a $5,000 taxable event there. But then later on you might liquidate it or you might sell it for 20,000.
00:11:48.138 - 00:12:19.340, Speaker B: And so then you've only had a $5,000 incremental taxable event instead of what would have been $10,000 if you had decided not to recognize that first one. So you can sort of go like. You could. You could say that it's sort of a wash and that it goes either way. It's, of course, like a timing difference. So the short answer is, generally speaking, like we would advise, like from a CPA standpoint, we would say if you're going to be conservative, yeah, you would treat that as a taxable event. But some people are pretty insistent that it's not.
00:12:19.340 - 00:12:26.938, Speaker B: And that's, of course, you know, something. A decision to make in consultation with the CPA or your tax advisor, whoever's preparing the taxes.
00:12:27.124 - 00:13:06.608, Speaker C: Yeah. And Tyke, just to add to that a little bit, you know, you'll notice a recurring theme with a lot of the questions that you ask here probably, which is, you know, the IR's hasn't given any guidance and it's truly a gray area. So in situations where things are a gray area, where the. In the lack of clear guidance from the IR's, in the absence of clear guidance from the IR's, we just suggest be consistent, be conservative. So, you know, what's very clear is that if you're going to do that, you're trading from Ren BTC to WBTC as a taxable event. Then you better do the same Ren BDC did. Any other wrapped bitcoin coin or all your other wrapped coins should also be a taxable event.
00:13:06.608 - 00:13:46.102, Speaker C: There are people that argue there are CPAs, preparers, et cetera, or individual taxpayers who are arguing, hey, there's no economic substance in this. It's like I'm trading one s and P 500 ETF, an exchange traded fund for another s and P 500. They're exactly the same asset and they move in lockstep. So that is technically more like a deposit and a withdrawal. And truly we reach out to the IR's and we have these ongoing conversations and we hope for clear guidance in these matters because that would make everything so easy. If we could just say yes or no and be done with it, it would make everyone's life so much easier. All of our clients, all of ours.
00:13:46.102 - 00:14:26.490, Speaker C: But unfortunately, given that there isn't clear guidance and that arguably people could see it both ways, so what are what Arthur pointed out like being conservative, calling it a taxable event when you're recognizing a gain that is more conservative. And then in other times if you have a loss, let's say you bought your bitcoin for 60,000, then you wrap it into Ren BTC when it's 45,000. And you did that just to get a taxable loss. Well now is that a taxable event? Is that more concerned? So you can see why it's a very slippery slope here and why it's so difficult. And again, you know, hate to always go back to this, but yeah, you need to talk. You need to figure out what's right with your situation. Look at everything.
00:14:26.490 - 00:15:11.974, Speaker C: Think about it about from being consistent across all the similar types of transactions and just being conservative. Whatever you're comfortable with, with your CPA, with your preparer, it's not a simple decision, you know, unfortunately. But. And what is, what is very clear, what is black and white? Trading bitcoin for ripple trading bitcoin for Ethereum, that's a taxable event. You have a capital gain or a capital loss based on the us dollar amount difference between when you bought it and when you sold it for that other coin wrapping. You know, unfortunately it's a gray area, but all we can really do is give our clients and our users all the information that's out there, the whole spectrum of choices. But like Arthur said, you know, if someone has no clue what they're doing, you may want to just opt into a hit.
00:15:11.974 - 00:15:39.018, Speaker C: I'm just going to be conservative, consistent. They're all taxable events. Go from there. And as you pointed out, the biggest thing is once you sell all your crypto for dollars, the magnitude of your gains are exactly the same. Whether each of those incremental wrappings, et cetera, was a taxable event, wasn't, et cetera. The dollars you made are the dollars you made in the end. So there, there may be a timing difference, but the beauty of this is that the magnitude of your gains are what they are in the end.
00:15:39.018 - 00:15:50.252, Speaker C: Once, once it all comes out in the wash. I think that's why the IR's is probably comfortable with people filing different ways until they give clear guidance, which would be the perfect solution. And we're hoping for that to come soon.
00:15:50.436 - 00:16:22.926, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. Yeah. Because for me personally, I am also relatively conservative when it comes to these things. So I purchased, I have some bitcoin from August and September of last year which I want to bring into defi to use as collateral to yield farm with it. However, if it's then like still that bitcoin is in short term capital gains territory. Uh, so if I wrap it, then I have to wait another twelve months for, you know, for it to go to long term capital gains. So, uh, there's also like those minus differences there, which is kind of a headache.
00:16:23.078 - 00:16:49.258, Speaker C: Yeah, and that's another gray area. Right. Because look, if you, if it's not a taxable event, then, you know, theoretically the holding period wouldn't reset. But you're exactly right. If you don't know, then you kind of got to plan for a worst case scenario. You know, it's not a bad idea to kind of think, well, the IR's may look at this and when I explain all the facts to them, they may just pick worst of all worlds. So your capital losses, they may say no, you know, their capital gains, they may say yes, that is a taxable event.
00:16:49.258 - 00:17:19.910, Speaker C: That's what, that's how it works for securities, for stocks and bought, like Tesla shares, Google shares for Wash sale trading. If you buy something and that, or if you sell something and buy it back within 30 days, if it's a loss, they actually disallow that. That's a wash sale for a security for a stock. If it's a gain, it's recognized and you have to pay taxes on it. Now, a lot of people have disagreed. A lot of knowledgeable accountants, cpas have disagreed. Do wash sale rules apply to crypto? And the IR's hasn't given clear guidance.
00:17:19.910 - 00:18:02.116, Speaker C: You know, for us, all we can say is in the absence of clear guidance, again, be consistent, conservative, and use common sense. You know, your intent matters. Did you accidentally sell Ethereum and then buy it back? Cause you're just, you know, you're playing the market. You, you liked it one day and you didn't like it two weeks ago, or were you literally doing it to get a tax loss and then buying it back immediately? You know, that may be looked at differently by the IR's. So unfortunately, you know, there are a lot of gray areas here. It's a lot to take in. But if you can become an expert at this, it will pay dividends across your whole financial ecosystem of hopefully, what we try to preach to people is start a 401K, get these low hanging fruit.
00:18:02.116 - 00:18:54.704, Speaker C: We're not just about crypto and we're about teaching people, empowering them for their own investing knowledge, for their tax knowledge, to know what are the rules, what are the parameters, so that it's not just billionaires and people who have private wealth managers at Morgan Stanley who get to do these things like tax loss, harvesting, oh, tracking my tax lots and specific identification. We want to democratize access to that knowledge. And so that's why Alex and I started token tax. Now it's been five years, but that was our big thing. This knowledge exists. There are products out there that let you know Excel works. A lot of CPAs use Excel, but in order to track your tax lots and figure out, hey, I bought Ethereum 30 different times, but I want to sell the one that I bought two years ago, but at the highest price to get a long term capital gate, we develop software to let people do that.
00:18:54.704 - 00:19:10.352, Speaker C: You know, that's what our minimization algorithm does, but it allows you to track your tax slots in real time. So that's, that's a big differentiator from us, you know. Yeah. We are also the market leader in Defi. It's hard. Defi is whackable, don't get me wrong. Don't expect miracles, to be honest.
00:19:10.352 - 00:19:46.662, Speaker C: But people who have tried every product, we have a lot of influencer types, they've tried every product and they're like, yeah, token tax is head and shoulders above in DeFi, and we want to preserve that lead, but it is really hard. We invest a lot of engineering resources and time into, like you said, all the new blockchains, you know, what's coming next, what's in the pipeline. And plus, you know, the old hats, the Ethereum blockchain, all the DeFi ecosystem, new protocols, level two, level three, there's always something new coming out, which makes the job really interesting, exciting, but yeah, probably maybe more information than you needed. But we just like to add as much context as we can.
00:19:46.806 - 00:20:17.160, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Yeah, thanks for that. So I think that's a good transition to, I guess, explaining what the product actually does. So I guess from my perspective, I use DeFi, right, Ethereum, polygon, other blockchains. So if I want to file taxes for, I guess this year around, like, let's say March of next year, do I just provide a, like my ethereum addresses and then your software will just do everything for me? Or is there like other work that I have to do in order for me to like file my taxes over crypto?
00:20:19.060 - 00:20:43.410, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a whole range of services that we offer. So people who just, you know, I have finance and Coinbase and I dabbled on Uniswap and I made a couple trades. So, yeah, for Uniswap, you just. So for Binance, Coinbase, you follow the instructions, connect via API or download the CSV drag and drop it in. And it's like magic. It makes your 89 49, makes you an income report. You just give it to.
00:20:43.410 - 00:21:00.698, Speaker C: It makes every tax form you need, you just give it to your CPA. Or you can hire, you know, our team to file, or you can file yourself in turbotax and make Turbotax. No. When you start adding in DeFi protocols, it gets more complicated. Uniswap that is automatically supported. It's easy. You just plug in your ETH address, and the Uniswap magically appears.
00:21:00.698 - 00:21:27.262, Speaker C: We know what your gains and losses are on all trades. So as it gets more complicated, what's tricky is, you know, like you mentioned earlier, you do yield farming. So that's actually a different tax form. And this is, you know, the IR's, this is in us, that's a different tax form than the old school when you just traded crypto. That's a schedule D. An 8949 rolls up to a schedule D, which rolls up to the 1040, you know, so a lot of competitor. Oh, we do four tax forms.
00:21:27.262 - 00:21:54.230, Speaker C: Well, really, it's one set of numbers that rolls up three times. But, you know, it's. But yield farming, you know, that's a different tax form. It's income. It's either schedule c, ordinary income, perhaps other investment income. This is another thing that people need to work out with their tax preparer based on how actively they're doing it, whether they have losses to offset. You know, something else that I think you wanted to bring up was our gas fees, our expenses.
00:21:54.230 - 00:22:42.474, Speaker C: You know, can you use that to offset income? And the answer is, you know, theoretically, we just want to, we say, use common sense. If you made 100,000 yield farming and you spent 20,000 on gas fees to do that yield farming, theoretically, you should be just paying taxes on 80,000. But in practice, on your tax forms, we need to make sure you're doing it on the right tax form so that that's allowed. You know, so it's like, okay, I'm kind of running a business as a yield farmer, and I have this income. You know, there are a lot of different ways that it can be handled. Different CPAs attorneys have different preferences, but theoretically, it goes back to these same core foundational ideas of use common sense. You know, if you made 80,000 in yield farming revenue and you add a lot in gas fees, you probably shouldn't be paying taxes on the full 80,000.
00:22:42.474 - 00:22:59.960, Speaker C: That doesn't really seem fair, but it's a matter of making sure your accountant knows how to take those expenses and roll them together with the income to make sure that you're only paying the amount of taxes that you know, that you should based on the income you had, not the top level revenue, the income, the profits.
00:23:00.340 - 00:23:05.036, Speaker A: Got it, got it, got it. Yeah. That's really nice, being able to use, I guess, the gas fees, which is.
00:23:05.068 - 00:23:37.598, Speaker C: Very for you if you're yield farming. So, yeah, you plug in your ETh addresses and theoretically, like magic, it should work. But if something's unsupported, if you were, you know, messing around on badger, messy. Oh, I'm on level three of this new protocol that's very obscure and I have income. You may have to do manual work. You know, most people who are Defi degens have to do manual work when they look at their ETH addresses and they say, oh, that wasn't a deposit, that was income. Oh, that wasn't a spend, that was a trade for this.
00:23:37.598 - 00:24:09.384, Speaker C: And, you know, you can link up two trades. So we, we're always rolling out new tools to try to make this as efficient as possible. But we have our, like, regular automated software and then we have our CPA assisted accountant assisted vip and gold level packages. That's for real. Defi Djens probably need something like that where you have a dedicated token tax accountant who will take all your data, your ETH addresses and work with you. You know, we try to do as much of the heavy lifting as we can, but we say, all right, it looks like you were doing this on synthetix and you had this and this debate. You know, this happened.
00:24:09.384 - 00:24:35.528, Speaker C: This is what it looks like in your final outputs. You had these gains, this amount of income. Does that check out with you? And you'll probably say, oh, yeah, that does look right, but I also had these expenses. Did we include those? Oh, yeah, you did. So that's typically how the process goes on. Defi reconciliations. Those of you who are out there who have been trying to do it in excel or use other software, you'll probably realize these things all come in as deposits and withdrawals.
00:24:35.528 - 00:25:08.872, Speaker C: And then that's the starting point and you kind of have to go from there. So our software automates as many of the contracts, as many of the protocols to say, oh, that actually was a trade, that was income, et cetera, as we can. But there are always new levels, new things coming out. So all we ask from our clients is to be patient. And you asked another thing for 2020, a lot of people are showing up now giving us our data. Keep in mind that you could actually come and use the crypto tax software in real time during 2021, and it's a lot easier to keep track of. Oh, I made my first trade on that protocol.
00:25:08.872 - 00:25:37.554, Speaker C: It's showing up as a deposit withdrawal. It should be a trade. You know, you tell us that and then we can fix it in an automatic way going forward. An ounce of prevention can save a pound of cure in a lot of ways. So most of our returning users, come 2021, they use it throughout the year, and they can see what their capital gains and losses are as the year goes on, and then even make mock trades like, oh, I'm going to sell some ethereum. Let me see how much my gain or loss will go up with each accounting method. Fifo lifo minimization.
00:25:37.554 - 00:26:05.962, Speaker C: That way they're empowered to make their decisions before they make a trade, right. And then they can do what's called tax loss harvesting. So come the end of the year, I've got this much bitcoin, this much ethereum, all these random other tokens I've been farming. What is my unrealized gain or unrealized loss? You know, what savvy investors and people with wealth managers and hedge funds do is, oh, ive got these unrealized losses. Oh, I bought, you know, I bought Moderna. Thats way up. But unfortunately, I bought Tesla at the peak its down.
00:26:05.962 - 00:26:39.754, Speaker C: Im going to sell my Tesla stock and get a capital loss and use that to shield other income I already have. So our tax loss harvesting dashboard tool allows software users to do that. And then our higher level packages, you actually get a call, get on, get on the phone, get on a zoom with one of our accountants who help you manage that process and hold your hand through it. So it just depends how comfortable you are in excel and coding or whatever, making your own decisions versus wanting a financial professional. And obviously the price ranges accordingly, as you can imagine.
00:26:39.882 - 00:27:20.538, Speaker A: I see. Yeah, it sounds like a lot of work for a Defi degen. And I guess it's good that your team actually has a bunch of Defi dgens that can empathize with what we're going through. And I guess it, I guess, like, if you're like yield farming as much as I am, it's worth tracking how much you're putting into a particular protocol and how much you pull out just in case software doesn't detect it. Right? For example, this obscure form I'm in, I'll just say, okay, I'm tracking, I put, let's say $5,000 in it. And after a month, I pulled $9,000. So I can just say I made $4,000 without going through all those hoops in the middle.
00:27:20.714 - 00:27:28.298, Speaker C: Uh, so that's exactly right. And, you know, people that do that for themselves, it's just, it makes it so much easier. Sorry, Arthur. What do you guys.
00:27:28.474 - 00:28:02.388, Speaker B: I was just going to say, I mean, adding on to what you said earlier, Zach, like, what you're, what you just described, Tybee, was like, if doing that as close to, like, real time as possible will make tax season, like, infinitely easier if you already have, like, some idea and you've been tracking this stuff in real time, and it's also helpful for, like, understanding your sort of investment strategies and your performance. But just from, like, making taxes easier standpoint, doing things, like, as much as you can, like, during the year, as opposed to waiting until, like, you know, tax season shows up, will just make things, like, a million times easier for you when it's time to actually do your taxes.
00:28:02.564 - 00:28:08.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad I kind of did that right now. So I'll keep doing that in the future.
00:28:08.660 - 00:28:41.272, Speaker C: It's just being financially literate, too. Like so many people, they're buying and selling things and making sure they have no idea how much they make in dollars or eth or anything. So to me, that's problematic for a number of reasons, because realistically, you're doing this for one, to explore the technology, but also to build your financial health, to build your savings. So tracking that even just informally in Excel, et cetera, or using a software like token tax, but at the very least, just keeping track on whatever spreadsheet, it's a really smart thing to do.
00:28:41.416 - 00:29:32.270, Speaker B: And it's really easy in defi between liquidity pools and compounding and all the different stuff you can do. It's really easy to get to the point where you're making dozens or hundreds of transactions a week and all of that stuff, you know what you're doing when you're doing it, but when you come back and look at it months later, it's like you got a transaction list. Some of our larger customers have thousands or sometimes even tens of thousands of transactions that we have to sort of wade through, or that they have to wade through and try and go back and think, like, what was I doing at this point in time? Like, what are all these things? The software makes it easy when things are supported, but it's just so much easier if you're doing some degree of, like, you know, tracking and maintenance in real time so that you understand exactly what you were doing so you don't have to try and remember it.
00:29:34.170 - 00:30:02.760, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Thanks for that. So speaking of, like, smart things to do, I get. I got this question a lot from my audience, but are there, like, particular tricks you can do with, like, forming my own llc, for example? Right. Because I believe filing as just like, a normal, like, person compared to, like, running a yield farming business, that has different tax implications. Right. So what do your clients, like most often do? I guess with, like, llcs or just like, any other tricks that you're aware of?
00:30:02.840 - 00:30:24.648, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. You know, I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions. Setting up an LLC will not actually help most people. Because you live in California, you'll have to pay $800 a year. You'll add a whole level of compliance. It'll be a flow through LLC. Your business as a yield farmer, whether you set up an LLC or not, you're already able to deduct your expenses.
00:30:24.648 - 00:30:58.004, Speaker C: You know, oh, I went to that conference to learn about yield farming. Oh, I paid these gas fees. Setting up an LLC does not get you that benefit. It does provide liability protection if you need that, which, you know, most people don't. So, you know, I'd say of the people that show up who thought they were doing the smart thing by setting up an LLC to save money on taxes, ultimately they spent more money. It didn't result in any tax savings because you already, as a quote, unquote, sole proprietor, can take the deductions for a self employed business. So there's a really common misconception.
00:30:58.004 - 00:31:26.590, Speaker C: You know, there can be advantages. If you're making a lot of money, a couple hundred thousand into being an s corp, paying yourself a salary, you need to be on payroll. Long story short, those are the only people who realistically are benefiting. And, you know, it can be marginal. And that's something to talk to a CPA or an attorney about. You know, I'm sure Arthur will have more to add on that. But one of the biggest prop, one of the biggest mistakes I see people making is like, oh, I'm just going to set up an LLC.
00:31:26.590 - 00:31:51.392, Speaker C: I'm doing this as a business. I want tax deductions. That's not how it works. Your tax deductions, you already could take them as a self employed person. You know, and this is the same if you're a consultant. Whatever you're doing, you know, an LLC doesn't change that. If you're a single member LLC, or even setting up a Partnership LLC, those taxes just flow through to your personal account, and you don't really get a benefit for it, and you create extra admin.
00:31:51.392 - 00:32:13.110, Speaker C: Now, you need to file a business return for your partnership to hire a CPA. For that, you have separate books, bank account. It's time, you know, so be very, very, very thoughtful about. You know, a lot of people get bad advice to set up llcs. I'll tell you who benefits from, you know, people setting up llcs. The attorneys setting them up. You know, not to be too cynical, but.
00:32:13.110 - 00:32:17.066, Speaker C: But I mean, in some cases. And the accountants make sense. And the accountants.
00:32:17.098 - 00:32:18.834, Speaker B: Yeah. Don't forget this. Don't forget the cpas.
00:32:18.882 - 00:32:19.994, Speaker C: You'd have to do the benefits.
00:32:20.082 - 00:32:59.234, Speaker B: Yeah, no, Zach's exactly right. Unless you have another independent business reason to set up a separate legal entity, like an LLC or a corporation or whatever it is, generally speaking, your solo crypto investor, your defi investor, is not going to do anything other than generate more paperwork and more professional fees for accountants or lawyers to deal with that stuff. You're going to protect yourself from liability. But I don't know, you know, if you're trading crypto, like, you're not, like, particularly liable. There's nothing that you're doing that is, like, really necessitates, like, preventing someone from suing you. Right. You don't need to protect your assets in that way.
00:32:59.234 - 00:33:16.110, Speaker B: I mean, that's obviously, like, a question for an attorney to answer. But it's just. Yeah, it's. Generally speaking, it's like, Zach's totally right. Like, the idea that you're somehow, like, getting tax benefits without any other sort of business incentive, this, like, it's definitely a misconception. We see that all the time.
00:33:16.500 - 00:33:57.992, Speaker C: You know, the joke in crypto is like, well, all right, if you're mining eth and your mining rig is in a factory and it burns down, and. And then you have this liability that for those people occasionally we see. Yeah, I started an LLC so that I have liability protection in case that happens. So obviously, that's a pretty far fetched thing. If you're just trading crypto, who's going to sue you? Who do you need liability from? But I will say some people out there taking money from a lot of people, taking people's money, investing it, that you probably. I mean, you almost certainly should be talking to a lawyer about what legal structure makes sense, because, yeah, those people could sue you and say, hey, you took my money. What happened to it? So that's something I like to call out.
00:33:57.992 - 00:34:16.285, Speaker C: You know, people putting a bunch of money in someone else's ETH address, letting them farm it for them, invest it for them. They. They may be taking chances. They may want to talk to an attorney about setting up some type of corporate structure, an LLC, whatever, a C Corp, to protect their personal assets unrelated to this venture.
00:34:16.437 - 00:34:16.741, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:16.765 - 00:34:41.936, Speaker B: If you're going into business with other people in any meaningful way, like, generally speaking, like, some type of partnership or corporate structure is going to be helpful, but, like, your solo crypto investor, most likely, unless, again, you've got a whole bunch of mining rigs set up, probably not going to get you any tax benefit. Probably just going to get you a state tax bill and a big CPA bill and maybe an attorney bill, too.
00:34:42.128 - 00:35:02.258, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess the general answer is it kind of depends on the person, right? Like, it depends on your situation. There's no black and white solution for, like, everyone. Right. It's just like, depending on, like. Like, where you are in life, how much money you're moving, like, what other, like, liabilities you have. Like, talk to a CPA, talk to an account, and figure it out then.
00:35:02.384 - 00:35:35.236, Speaker C: Uh, so true as always. But honestly, for generally, for most individuals who are investing crypto, it does not make sense. And 90% of the people who I see who set up llcs, they regret it when they. When, you know, when we go through the math with them and we say, all right, and you paid that fee, now you need to close it because you're not actually using, you know, you're not actually saving any money, now you got to pay a fee to close it with your state. You didn't file it last year, you know, so for some people, it does make sense to. And those people will probably have the sophistication to hire an attorney or an accountant to figure it out for their team of them. Joe Schmoe.
00:35:35.236 - 00:35:37.268, Speaker C: Yeah, or a team of people that.
00:35:37.284 - 00:35:54.878, Speaker B: Are going to help them, like, you know, move stuff offshore and do, like, all sorts of more elaborate, like, tax maneuvers, like, for that stuff. I'm sure there's. There's definitely, like, some tax benefits involved, but you have to be, like, making a ton of money to make that kind of thing worth it.
00:35:55.044 - 00:36:43.974, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. So the next question I have is, I guess we kind of covered it, but I guess being more, I guess, concise with what actually happens is how do LP tokens get taxed? Right? So let's say I entered this, like, farm pharmax, where I provide liquidity for, let's say, a stable point pair, USDC and Dai, and let's say this is a crazy farm and every week I earn 10%. Right. So I provide $1,000 and next week, no, it's there. And I have $100 worth of farm tokens, which counts as income. So does the $100, is that income already or do I have to claim that for that to actually count as income? If I just let it sit there for, let's say, for the next three months, does that count as income if it's just not claimed?
00:36:44.142 - 00:37:15.310, Speaker B: Yeah, there's different schools of thought on this. I think the simplest answer is that. And what we see most often is that the claim is the tax flexible event. So if you're just letting it sit there. But of course it depends on the structure and like the specific nature. Like your typical LP, like I would say, and Zach, I don't know, correct me if you disagree, but I would say, like, when you actually claim that money for purposes of compounding it or doing something else with it, once that money is like yours and like in your wallet, that I think is probably would be considered the taxable event.
00:37:16.130 - 00:37:56.410, Speaker C: Yeah. And just to add on to that, what we know for sure is it's either the claim or when it goes in the wallet. Right. So you could, you know, if you're going to be one of those people, like, well, the worst case scenario is, you know, you can use that as a barometer. But yeah, like, what we know for sure is if you put in a thousand and money accumulated and eventually you claimed it and now it's 3000, then you add $2,000 of income at some point, either as when it came or when you claimed it. This goes back to the, you know, be consistent if you're going to do, if you're going to say, hey, that income event was when I claimed it on this plot, you know, then do that consistently across all the farms you're doing. Right.
00:37:56.410 - 00:38:29.010, Speaker C: It's when people try to say, oh, I'm going to do this one when I claimed it because, you know, it went down from when it came in there, you know, don't try to cherry pick because that's what the IR's will look for. For like, no, you're not being consistent, you know, so as long as you're consistent, making a good faith effort, you know, hate to say, hate to beat a dead horse, but it's a gray area for now. But so, you know, what we know for sure is eventually that that is income. The timing of it, you know, like Arthur said, most people do file it as an income event when they claim it.
00:38:29.430 - 00:39:09.958, Speaker A: I see. Is there any scenario where like an LP position can be a long term, can be in long term capital gains? Because I feel like how LP tokens work and how you earn income, especially if you like, compound whatever interest you earn back to the position, it's. They're all short term, right? Like, even if I leave my LP tokens in it in a particular form for a year, and I use something to hyper compound, uh, if I let it sit there for a year, hypothetically, um, which is like a rare case. Uh, but would that count as long term capital gains or would the safe route be just assume everything is short term capital gains because in order to compound, you kind of have to claim it and then redeposit? Does that make sense?
00:39:09.974 - 00:39:40.324, Speaker C: I think you answered your own question. Yeah, I think you literally answered your own question. Like, you know, it's probably short term capital gain, which is conservative, you know, which is a higher tax rate. Now are there people out there, hedge funds who have big legal, you know, who say, well, I'm literally taking money and I'm, you know, I'm compounding it. And so not all of it should be income, some of it should be capital gain. This is actually, you know, what carried interest is in some way. I mean, Arthur knows more about this than this is sort of the argument of carried interest in hedge.
00:39:40.324 - 00:40:39.190, Speaker C: A lot of big private equity firms are sort of getting under scrutiny with the IR's and getting in hot water about basically taking what arguably is ordinary income, or as you said, short term capital gains, which are sort of taxed at the same rate, and try to shift it to long term capital gains. And that is something that the IR's does watch. You know, the KKRs, the Blackstones of the world, they want to do whatever they can to shift compensation from their management fees, which is income, and taxed at a much higher rate, to long term capital gains. But to answer your question, not only is it maybe short term capital gains to be conservative, but arguably it's income, it's ordinary income, so it's actually more. And theoretically those are kind of taxed at the same rate, but there is fICA self employment tax up to a certain, certain level. I don't want to get too much into the details, but to be the most conservative, that money that you're earning from yield farming, that might be ordinary income or other income.
00:40:41.210 - 00:41:54.460, Speaker B: I think at least in part. And like, I think at least in part, it depends on the way that the protocol works, right? Like if you're investing in something like urine, where you make your deposit into like a vault, and then it, you don't touch it again, and you're not actually actively claiming anything, and it's all activity that's happening in the vault. And then at some point you withdraw and you just end up with a larger share. I think you could make the argument in that situation, since you're not doing anything, that you could see that as a long term capital gain if you held it for longer than a year. But I think, generally speaking, Zach's right, that, I mean, you sort of, like, it depends on the data that's available and the way that the protocol works. And like, generally speaking, if you're economically better off as a result of something that you did, that's considered income, right? Like, it's going to be something that's taxable. And it's like, if you are economically better off, meaning like, you now have those tokens that you can earn more income from, right? If you're compounding, you're economically better off because you took something and now it's making more money for you, like, that event is generally going to be considered income.
00:41:54.460 - 00:42:13.380, Speaker B: And so that's back to what Zach was saying about common sense. If you feel like there was some type of economic benefit that occurred, for example, in a claim or compound situation, chances are you've incurred a taxable event. Like you're better off. You should probably be paying tax on that.
00:42:14.120 - 00:42:15.420, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:42:16.120 - 00:43:18.218, Speaker C: And in practice, we can talk about these hypotheticals, but then to take a step further, when we're actually looking at the data on the ethereum blockchain, et cetera, it becomes even harder, right? Because you have to sometimes different amounts put in results in different amounts coming out. And so. But all we can really do, what we try to do to help our clients is, say, from the spectrum, on the spectrum of income, ordinary income is probably taxed at the highest rate until you max out your FICA. If your CPA is filing your activity like you're a self employed person, you know, versus other income, and then short term capital gains are taxed at the same income tax rate, but you don't have FICA, and then long term capital gains or taxed at a lower rate, and people, you know, based on their activity and their intent are going to file different ways. And Arthur is exactly right. It really depends on the protocol, how it works. Was it more like a long term capital gain, or was it more like you were doing a regular activity and it was ordinary income? And so it's not necessarily a one size fits all.
00:43:18.218 - 00:43:30.042, Speaker C: In a perfect world, the IR's will give 80 pages of guidance and say, yeah, this protocol is taxed like this, these rewards are taxed like this. That would be a beautiful thing. It would make everyone's life so much simpler.
00:43:30.186 - 00:43:37.510, Speaker B: And they would keep that guidance up to date, like every day as somebody releases a new protocol. That would be really amazing.
00:43:37.890 - 00:44:07.102, Speaker C: Yeah. And we love to be, like, in a working group to help them figure these things out because it's like an ounce of prevention, saves a pound of care for it. You know, cpas and attorneys are going to be arguing over this for years and so much time, it's just going to be billed to clients. And, you know, if the IR's would give clear guidance, it would solve a lot of those problems. But, you know, they have their reasons and they're, you know, limited in the resources and staff they have. And these are very difficult concepts to understand, especially as, you know, it's whack a mole. Like this one came out.
00:44:07.102 - 00:44:21.738, Speaker C: It's not exactly the same as that one. And so I think the IR's is hesitant to say things that could be misinterpreted or. So they're kind of leaving it to the private sector to figure this out on their own, and then they're going to take what is submitted and they're going to go from there, at least for now.
00:44:21.874 - 00:45:05.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess it's difficult for everyone given that everything is, like, in the gray area. So speaking of which, speaking of gray areas, like, how do, let's take me for example, right? Like, I'm just like, farming, like almost every day, 24/7 what steps can I take to prevent the potential for audits? Because I think I'm going to try my best to report my taxes, but maybe I make a mistake or two. Have you heard of any horror stories of people getting audited with regards to crypto? And what's the best steps that I can take to, you know, prevent those, like IR's audits?
00:45:06.880 - 00:45:29.910, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think the most important thing, you know, it's less about avoiding audits. You know, audit risk depends on how much money you make. If you're self employed, a lot of things that are kind of outside of your control. The more money you make, the more likely you're to be audited. If you're self employed, you're more likely to be audited. So not everyone will have equal audit risk. If you make 30,000 a year and you just get a w two very, very, very small chance you're going to get audited.
00:45:29.910 - 00:46:26.112, Speaker C: But what you can do so that the audit goes well and isn't painful and isn't, you know, disastrous, like there are horror stories. The horror stories are because people didn't do anything, they didn't try, they didn't make a good faith effort. What the IR's wants to see, they understand how complicated this is and they are understanding, you know, as long as you. A good faith effort means use attack software, you know, put in the work, track your records. If it turns out that, oh, like I, you know, more of it was ordinary income and a little bit less of it was short term capital gains. But the tax difference is very minimal, they're not going to have a problem with that because you reported everything, you put all your transactions on there. Where, where people have horror stories is, oh, they just, oh, I know that Coinbase is in the US, so I'm just going to report Coinbase and I'm going to assume the IR's doesn't know about binance, doesn't know about my ethereum, that, you know, it's just you're asking for trouble, you're asking for a disaster.
00:46:26.112 - 00:46:58.750, Speaker C: And they're not gonna, they're not gonna be lenient because you went out of your way to not disclose everything. And that's who is getting those letters and had to check like under penalty of perjury. Did you submit all your information to the best of your knowledge? So all you can really do is don't stress out too much. You know, a lot of people are gonna have mistakes. Like, like we kind of pointed out the dollars you put in, the us dollars that you literally put in, in your on ramp. And someday you could take a snapshot of your portfolio or you could even sell everything. Worst case scenario, and you'll have an amount of dollars.
00:46:58.750 - 00:47:30.812, Speaker C: The difference between those two things, it's an algebra equation that needs to add up to your income and your capital gains in each of the years combined. So there is a solution here. It's not like an impossible black box. The timing may change, but the most important thing I think is make a good faith effort. If it's beyond the scope of what you can do, hire a professional, talk to a professional, talk to a CPA, hire a firm to help you and factor that in before you start messing around on all these protocols. Truly people expect miracles. They show up at our site.
00:47:30.812 - 00:48:05.576, Speaker C: And if you have been doing ton of degenerate defi that's not supported, obviously a $200 software isn't going to be able to solve all your problems. CPAs are expensive, especially ones who know how to do defi and fix your manual transactions. Unfortunately, we're bootstrapped. We're not trying to get rich. My co founder and I didn't pay ourselves for the first several years, poured the money back into the company so we could hire all stars like Arthur and poach him away from big four firms and just build the offerings that we have for our users. But keep that in mind. We're a startup.
00:48:05.576 - 00:48:20.076, Speaker C: We're doing the best we can. And the IR's is understanding. They just want to see truly a good faith effort. Don't hide things. Just try your best. If you overpay, in one year, it'll balance out. It'll be six of one, half dozen of another.
00:48:20.076 - 00:48:42.052, Speaker C: Because in the end of the day, the us dollar is in, and the us dollars you have at the end of the. Whenever you get out of your crypto or take a snapshot, that is an algebraic equation that can be solved, you know, so don't stress too much. That's. That's the most important thing I could drive home. As long as you're making that good, fit effort. And I don't know if Arthur has more to add about avoiding audits or.
00:48:42.076 - 00:49:03.610, Speaker B: Whatever, but, yeah, avoiding audits is like sort of a fruitless effort. Like, I think Zach's right. Like, do be consistent, do, you know, be thorough, make a good faith effort. And, you know, if an audit happens, which it may like, you know, good luck. You'll be, you'll be okay as long as you did all those things. You know, honestly, it'll be annoying for sure.
00:49:04.270 - 00:49:27.376, Speaker C: Yeah. So many people think, oh, there's all these really smart things I should be doing to save money on taxes or to avoid. And, you know, the truth is, the IR's is smart. Like, they know. So they close the tax loopholes. They have the GLT, you know, they have the gilti tax. For people who are doing foreign offshore shelters, even, you know, really savvy big entities, they end up not saving money now because the IR's says, all right, that sounds like a tax loophole.
00:49:27.376 - 00:49:59.414, Speaker C: And they do. They close these things and all you could do is make a good faith effort. There are a few things you could do to make sure that you're legally paying the amount, you know, you're not overpaying your taxes. One of those things is specific identification is allowed. So, like, token tax has our minimization algorithm. It's like, I said you don't have to use FIFO first in, first out, if you're tracking your tax lots. So if you're, you know, mining ethereum and you're getting Ethereum at different times every week for the last five years, you go to sell some because you want to buy something.
00:49:59.414 - 00:50:29.268, Speaker C: You can pick the tax lot that results in the smallest tax liability, which is going to be a long term capital gain that you earned at the highest price in that range. And so our software allows you to do that in real time. That's one thing you can do. A second thing is tax loss harvest. Sell your positions that are underwater toward the end of the year. Um, and, you know, a third thing is just don't, don't over. Don't stress that, like, you're not doing all the, oh, I don't have a legal structure.
00:50:29.268 - 00:50:51.786, Speaker C: I don't have this and that. You know, just do the easy things like unrelated to crypto. Max out your retirement every year because that shields you from taxes. If you have a job, max out your 401K if you don't have a job. I mean, sorry, if you're self employed, do a traditional IRA, talk to a CPA about this. But those are the, quote, unquote, you know, free lunches. And there are a million of them.
00:50:51.786 - 00:51:15.628, Speaker C: You know, CPAs account, like a lot of people online will say, buy my book. There's a million tax loopholes. To be honest, most of those are more trouble and more hassle than they're worth and more stress, and then people have it hanging over their head. But there are some free lunches that people don't take advantage of. Max out your retirements. Be smart about tracking your tax lots and tax loss harvest. You know, if you had a really big year, you had 80 grand in gains.
00:51:15.628 - 00:51:21.480, Speaker C: Go find some capital losses you have in November and December. Sell those positions and save money.
00:51:23.070 - 00:51:30.566, Speaker A: Yeah. Tax loss harvesting is definitely even in stocks. You can witness them, right?
00:51:30.678 - 00:51:30.878, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:30.894 - 00:51:42.094, Speaker A: I mean, stocks that tend to do worse just sell off in November and December just because no institutions are like, okay, I'm just going to use this as an opportunity to lower my, I guess, taxable income and whatnot.
00:51:42.222 - 00:51:51.550, Speaker C: Because they're savvy. Yeah. And then you push it down the road. And if you really like that stock, you can wait 30 days and buy it back. You can wait. You can buy a correlated asset. That's where some of the case law here came from.
00:51:51.550 - 00:52:09.086, Speaker C: Like for wash sales. People would sell a stock that was so, and then buy another one. And the IR's actually ruled. Nope. There is no economic substance to that transaction. You sold an ETF that was exactly the same as the other ETF you bought. We're disallowing your loss.
00:52:09.086 - 00:52:25.280, Speaker C: So you can kind of use that as, like, our common sense benchmark of. Yeah, if you sell bitcoin and buy it back immediately. Sell it at a big loss, buy it back immediately. The IR's might not allow that. Yeah, technically, watch sales don't apply. I see crypto cpas every, every day on Twitter. Watch sales don't apply.
00:52:25.280 - 00:52:41.220, Speaker C: Crypto is down today. Sell it and buy it back. It's like, it's a little bit of an oversimplification. You know, I hate to see that, because people read that and they make decisions that could blow up in their face. So all we can really do is give people a common sense explanation on a lot of these things that are gray areas.
00:52:42.690 - 00:52:51.722, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I mean, this has been a great conversation. I would like thank you both for answering all the questions and I guess sharing tax alpha, if that's even a.
00:52:51.746 - 00:52:52.310, Speaker C: Thing.
00:52:54.970 - 00:53:06.910, Speaker A: To wrap up the video. Is there anything that you want to tell my audience about, I guess, any more alpha that you can share about defi crypto taxes that might benefit my subscribers?
00:53:09.100 - 00:53:52.486, Speaker C: You know, I think, like I said, we, our token tax users, you can see people shouting us out on Twitter. We infuse our product with personal finance skills, and, you know, but if you don't use token tax, that's fine. Get smart about personal finance. You know, use the best credit card reward account you can. Max out your retirements, track your tax lots, not just for crypto, but for stock, too. You know, if you're, those of you, buying Moderna, buying, buying biointex, buying Tesla, buying all these stocks when you sell them, you know, I've seen dozens of Robinhood 1099 bees where all these people who are learning how to trade stocks, they have all these wash sales. So they're losing their losses because they're buying and selling meme stocks.
00:53:52.486 - 00:54:11.034, Speaker C: But they don't understand that, hey, those losses you got, they got disallowed because you bought it back in seven days. So just get smarteen about what the rules are. You know, wait 30 days if you're trading stocks to make sure it's not a wash sale. They're just low hanging fruit. And we try our best at Tokentax, you know, come check us out. Talk to us on intercom. The bottom right, little blue chat guy.
00:54:11.034 - 00:54:23.626, Speaker C: We're here to answer your questions. If you're a customer or not. Or you can tweet at us at Twitter. I mean, okentax. Sorry. And, you know, we'll do our best to answer our questions. We have tax loss harvesting webinars later in the year, but that, you know, we.
00:54:23.626 - 00:55:00.162, Speaker C: We've built that tax lot tracking and the tax loss harvesting into our basic software package. But if you have complicated Defi and unsupported protocols, you may be beyond the scope of that. But that doesn't mean it won't work for your binance, for your coinbase, for your Gemini, and that will go a really long way. In fact, that'll probably be the most material part for a lot of people. DeFi DGens factor in that you may need to hire an accountant to figure this out for you, at least the first year until you get into a good rhythm of how to track this. You know, people don't factor that cost in. Cause this is really hard to figure out, especially people who are making a lot of money.
00:55:00.162 - 00:55:37.316, Speaker C: Um, you know, and it's a material amount of money to figure out your gas fees that you spent. You know, you don't want to overpay your taxes by 10,000, but it's going to take, you know, 10 hours to figure out going blockchain transaction by transaction on ether, you know, on. On the Ethereum blockchain to figure out what happens. So please just be patient. Please do your homework a little bit before getting way too in the weeds with a big amount of money on certain things. And, you know, just get smart about credit cards, retirement accounts, taxes. These are the low hanging fruit that pay for themselves many times over in the course of your life if you get smart about them.
00:55:37.316 - 00:56:09.610, Speaker C: And we love this stuff. Points and milers. You know, before token tax, I was teaching personal finance, entrepreneurship, making math about money and those things, and teach for America for a little while in between accounting and finance and different corporate accounting and investment banking type jobs. And a lot of our team are really into that world. Just the financial hacking life, hacking your finances. So do yourself a favor and try to learn about those things as much as you can.
00:56:10.400 - 00:56:13.272, Speaker A: Awesome. How about you, Arthur? Do you have any alpha for.
00:56:13.456 - 00:56:55.418, Speaker B: Oh, man, I'm just like. I'm just like the. I'm the boring CPA to Zach's, like, dynamic CEO. Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know if I would call it alpha, but the one trick we, like, didn't talk about that I've seen a lot more discussion about lately is opening a self directed IRA so you can, like, take a retirement account, like the type of retirement account that you would, you know, in IRa, that you would ordinarily either regular or roth, that you would ordinarily invest in stocks and stuff, and you can use that to invest in crypto. I don't know. I don't know if I've seen one that lets you go all the way into defi, but that's sort of a cool move that I've seen lately. And especially useful if you're going to be generating a ton of gains.
00:56:55.418 - 00:57:38.806, Speaker B: If you anticipate that your strategy is going to pay off and that you're sort of in it for the long haul, using one of those to shield some of those gains from tax can be really awesome. The other side of that, the flip side of that, of course, is that if you lose money in that, that you don't get the benefit of the losses. So it's sort of locked in one way or another. And then I think it's definitely a stretch to call this alpha. But going back to what we said earlier, if you're a serious dgen and you're doing hundreds of transactions for thousands of transactions, keep track, do your best. Keep your own records to some extent, or use software like token tax. Either way, whatever it is, just keep track of it in real time.
00:57:38.806 - 00:57:54.830, Speaker B: It'll make your life a whole lot easier. If you're trying to pay your taxes at the end of the year and you're looking at thousands of transactions, it'll be really nice to have some real time records to understand what you were doing. So calling that alpha is probably a stretch, but that's sort of where I would leave it.
00:57:54.990 - 00:57:59.358, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a Roth Ira is definitely alpha because, I mean, depending on.
00:57:59.374 - 00:58:02.454, Speaker C: How old you're, you can like life alpha for sure.
00:58:02.542 - 00:58:14.134, Speaker A: It's like, I max out my Roth every single year, and it's just like, nice to, you know, pay less taxes because of it. And me personally, I hold GPTC on my. In my Roth Ira. Nice.
00:58:14.222 - 00:58:15.650, Speaker B: Because you're in crypto.
00:58:16.190 - 00:58:25.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, obviously, like, I'm hoping that GBTC gets back to its. Or it gets back to, like, the part. No, yeah, like, no discount.
00:58:25.670 - 00:58:28.334, Speaker C: The discount goes away. Yeah, yeah.
00:58:28.462 - 00:58:29.934, Speaker A: But like, if you have an erotic.
00:58:29.982 - 00:58:32.238, Speaker C: That's a fascinating one, but yeah, like.
00:58:32.254 - 00:58:51.702, Speaker A: If you have an eratha ra then, like, anything, any trades that you do is like, tax free, essentially. So hopefully more digital assets can be supported in, like, brokerage accounts in the future. But right now, I think it's mostly GPTC and E. And like, there's like some defi ETF's, but, like, they're like, not really that complex.
00:58:51.886 - 00:59:07.310, Speaker C: Well, yeah, and that's what Arthur was saying. So a self directed IRA, you can actually buy literal bitcoin. That actually gets you a regular IRA. You just go to Merrill edge, set up an IRA. A self directed IRA. You don't have to buy GBTC. You can buy physical.
00:59:07.310 - 00:59:39.534, Speaker C: In fact, you could buy houses. You can kind of buy. It depends. You need, but it requires enough resources to justify. And we don't do this, but you hire a firm that's kind of the principal that oversees it. But there are cool things out there. And since we went there, the most free lunch of all is an HSA, by the way, if people don't know what that is, if you have a high deductible health plan, like health insurance from Obamacare, whatever, you can max out an HSA, which I believe is 3500, maybe that's changed.
00:59:39.534 - 01:00:02.564, Speaker C: And that money is pre tax going in and pre tax going out. So you can invest it in whatever you want. So it's like even more magical. A Roth IRA that you said you have to pay the taxes upfront and then you don't pay the taxes when it comes out. So you have to do that math. Like, is my tax rate lower now? Well, then that's good. Whereas a traditional IRA, it shields taxes now.
01:00:02.564 - 01:00:09.196, Speaker C: But you do pay taxes when it comes out, so. But the HSA is like the best of both worlds, and it's limited in how much you could do.
01:00:09.228 - 01:00:55.192, Speaker B: But, yeah, just to throw this out there for everyone, that's not, like, super savvy in this stuff. HSA is a health savings account. So that's like, generally speaking, like money that you are anticipating that you are going to spend at some point in your life on healthcare, that's sort of the. That's sort of the rule. And, like, for most people, like, it makes sense. It's hard to think about it when you're sort of young, but, like, why would I put all this money away for healthcare? Like, I'm young and I'm healthy, but, like, at some point, it's sort of like coming back to where we're talking about, like, thinking about things long term from a personal finance standpoint, at some point, you or a loved one or some of those, you know, your family members or whatever it is, you're going to need to spend that money. And so you might as well put money away now, allow it to grow tax free for this particular purpose.
01:00:55.192 - 01:01:27.990, Speaker B: So that when you do have those expenses whenever, you know, whenever down the road, whenever it happens, you're not spending your wages at that point or your money, your savings account or whatever it is you're spending from this, like, other pool of, like, money that has grown tax free that you set aside. And so now all the other money that, you know, you've made at that point in time, hopefully you're millions and millions of dollars of crypto earning or whatever it is that money is, like, there for you to spend on, like, whatever ridiculous, you know, boats or houses or whatever it is that you want to buy. You don't have to spend it on your healthcare.
01:01:28.490 - 01:01:34.266, Speaker C: Well, yeah. And healthcare is broad, and you can use it to pay for kids and your grandparents, you know.
01:01:34.338 - 01:01:34.682, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:34.746 - 01:01:45.910, Speaker C: It's one of those things that, you know, you're Lasik. You're hearing it, you know, whatever, it's. You'll be able to do it. So. But, yeah, free lunch. Yeah. Yeah.
01:01:45.910 - 01:01:46.462, Speaker C: Seriously?
01:01:46.526 - 01:01:47.366, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
01:01:47.478 - 01:01:54.250, Speaker C: Adult diapers. A much bigger market than baby diapers. Shocking. Arthur and I both have babies.
01:01:54.590 - 01:01:56.262, Speaker B: You mean like, literally? Yeah, yeah.
01:01:56.326 - 01:02:09.498, Speaker C: Sorry. Literally and dollar wise and figuratively. We're full of a lot of random. Interesting, quote unquote life alpha, at least in our own minds. Okay, well, that was a question for us, but no.
01:02:09.554 - 01:02:09.826, Speaker B: Okay.
01:02:09.858 - 01:02:11.690, Speaker C: We'll end the video for users. Thanks.
01:02:11.730 - 01:02:14.350, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll end the video on the adult diapers alpha.
01:02:15.690 - 01:02:16.594, Speaker B: Sounds great.
01:02:16.722 - 01:02:24.154, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyways, thank you guys for coming on. I'm sure this video and I'd love to have you on later, I guess.
01:02:24.202 - 01:02:43.030, Speaker C: Yeah. When the taxes have fallen. Yeah, around tax season, you know, now is not. It's not on people's radar, but, you know, if your users are talking about this or watching this in February or September, we're happy to do a follow up with. I'm sure they'll follow up with specific questions. Do. We could do it more q and a?
01:02:43.370 - 01:02:46.130, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe you can do like, a live q and a or something.
01:02:46.290 - 01:02:47.370, Speaker B: Yeah, sounds good.
01:02:47.450 - 01:02:47.690, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:47.730 - 01:02:54.430, Speaker C: But great to meet you. Thanks. Thanks for. Thanks for. Thanks for your editing and post. Hopefully anything that was weird, you could.
01:02:54.930 - 01:02:59.870, Speaker A: Now. I'll keep the shadow. I'll make sure to leave that one in there.
01:03:00.170 - 01:03:00.810, Speaker B: Thanks.
01:03:00.930 - 01:03:03.714, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for coming on and, yeah, have a nice day.
01:03:03.762 - 01:03:05.588, Speaker C: Good luck. Yeah, yeah.
01:03:05.644 - 01:03:27.708, Speaker A: And make sure to follow tokentax on Twitter. They're already one of the leading brands in this space, and I think they're positioned well, especially because, I mean, I think we're all bullish crypto long term, and there's going to be just more and more demand for your services in the future. So, yeah, follow them on Twitter. Just visit their website, see what they have. Because, you know, I'll probably be using token tax in, like, five months from now.
