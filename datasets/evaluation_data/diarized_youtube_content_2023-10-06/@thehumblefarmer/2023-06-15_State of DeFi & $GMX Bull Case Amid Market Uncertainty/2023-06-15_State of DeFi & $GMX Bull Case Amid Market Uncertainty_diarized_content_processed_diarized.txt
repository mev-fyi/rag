00:00:01.040 - 00:00:24.142, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And today I just want to discuss the state of Defi and also why I'm still positive on the perp dex sector as well as GMX. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Link to the premium discord is in the description below as well. So let's get right into it. So I've been saying that, you know, I think that GMX is in its bottoming process. And, you know, I mean, I've been saying that, right.
00:00:24.142 - 00:00:54.520, Speaker A: But boy, oh boy, has it been a very steep bottoming process. And hopefully, right, this is the bottom, right? And admittedly right. In the wise words of Warren Buffett, I didn't think it would go down this much. But no, we're here. But why do I still think that? Why do I still think that it's going to be a strong coin. So whenever the market's correct and whenever sentiment is bad in the markets, no altcoin is going to be able to really just decouple and go up. Only maybe some low market cap coin can do that.
00:00:54.520 - 00:01:34.636, Speaker A: But generally, right, like anything over, let's say, $100 million cap is typically going to trade in line with other altcoins in the majors. And recently, right, we had the SEc go after some coins, calling them all securities. And then it also led to, you know, platforms like Robin Hood delisting Ada Matic. And so, and then this morning, we got news that Celsius is going to be just dumping. Like market dumping or maybe, I mean, yeah, I'm not sure how they're going to be dumping these coins, but they're going to take all the matic Ada link dots, et cetera, and convert it into BDE. And either so, you know, definitely, like, not great, right? Not good for sentiments. And it generally feels like it's a sin to be positive.
00:01:34.636 - 00:02:02.768, Speaker A: Any altcoin, you know, in the, in the short to medium term, longer term. Right. Of course, like, we can all be positive on, like, whatever fundamental bets you want to make, but in the short term, it definitely does not feel great. And of course, GMX has, you know, suffered immensely. I think it's like down 50% from its all time highs. And I think, like, the most it's been down was like roughly a year, like roughly 70. But this was back in 2022 when the platform was less battle tested.
00:02:02.768 - 00:02:49.898, Speaker A: But historically, one thing like, one observation I'll make is that perpetexis, I mean, mostly GMX, has typically led Defi out of despair phases. First was back in June, July of 2022, when three AC went the bust after Luna collapsed. Of course, it led everything to just nuke in price, but GMX was basically the only token in Defi that was actually up on the year. I think GMX and GNS was the only, like, coin, like above $100 million market cap that was actually positive on the year. And, you know, it would. It went from like roughly $15 to, you know, $60 from, you know, end of Q or beginning of Q three to the end of Q four. And, you know, it led us out of markets because it has good, strong fundamentals.
00:02:49.898 - 00:03:24.758, Speaker A: It benefits off of volatility and therefore, therefore. And then I guess, like the most recent nuke we had. I mean, you can kind of argue that this is like a nuke, but I think we're in the process of a nuke. So I'm talking about past nukes and how GMX has recovered and obviously. Right, the most recent one was FTX when, you know, FTX rugged everyone, and it led everything to nuke in price, right. Bitcoin is 16k either actually, either put in a higher low, but generally, like, everything just kind of nuked. And when Ftx rugged GMX, it went down.
00:03:24.758 - 00:03:49.020, Speaker A: I can't see this. GMX went down. What is this? On November 9, it went down 27%. And in the following day, it was up 35%. And then within like two days, it was like putting in. It was basically like, you know, putting in like new local highs, which is kind of insane. And I'm not really saying that that's going to happen, but typically, I'm just saying that, hey, you know, like, when markets nuke, when sentiments bad, like, everything just goes down with it.
00:03:49.020 - 00:04:18.618, Speaker A: But historically, I think perp Dex is mostly. GMX has been like the strongest coin coming out of these types of despair phases. And yes, this is not a good look. Right? I mean, it seems like. It definitely seems like systematic selling, and I've been kind of absorbing the supply unsuccessfully. But, you know, like, obviously, like, I have a bag, right? And, you know, like, I am biased. But let's talk about, like, you know, why I still think that, you know, it could be a good play.
00:04:18.618 - 00:04:38.386, Speaker A: And one of the reasons why I think it outperforms is that it actually, you know, has like, strong fundamentals and it actually makes money. Right. It pays like a yield. That's not inflationary tokens. It pays a yield in either. And it also allows for various yield farming strategies. So I'll talk about one strategy that I've been doing that's been, you know, working pretty successfully.
00:04:38.386 - 00:04:58.670, Speaker A: Of course, no, Gop, you get to be the house of the casino, right. The GMAX casino. And you get paid in fees. And also, if traders lose money, you make money from that. But if traders make money, Gop loses from that. But typically, retail traders tend to be super long. So whenever the markets go down, GOP tends to actually benefit.
00:04:58.670 - 00:05:33.756, Speaker A: And actually, I'll do, like, an all time chart here. But while I wait for that to load, let's kind of discuss this farmers hedge strategy, because I got a bunch of questions about it. I mean, I've talked about this strategy many, many times on this channel, but I was, like, quickly walk through, like, how it works and why I love it so much. So, basically, the concept is using a money market such as Aave, where I use something like ether as collateral, which is what I'm doing now. Then I borrow avax, right, on aave. And then I sell that avax, right? So I have ether as collateral. I borrow Avax, paying 6%.
00:05:33.756 - 00:06:02.180, Speaker A: Sorry, 5%. It's not that great, but that's fine. And then I sell my avax that I've borrowed, right. I go to buy Gop, take my avax, like, everything that I borrowed, and, like, just, like, sell it right into GoP. And then, you know, basically, my debt is denominated in Avax. But I've sold my debt, and I basically denominate in GLP. So when the markets actually nuke in price, like it did a couple days ago, you know, like when Avax.
00:06:02.180 - 00:06:20.180, Speaker A: Yeah, like this. This is a painful candle, right? So I think I put this position on somewhere. Yes, like some. Somewhere here. And then it's kind of nukes, right? And when this happens, of course, the value of my debt just nukes in price by, like, 20, 30%. But the value of GLP kind of maintains its value. Of course, it kind of goes down.
00:06:20.180 - 00:06:41.550, Speaker A: But the composition of Gops like this, it's like 5% avax. The target weight is 24% eth, 20% btC, and then roughly, you know, 50 ish percent stable coins. So actually, it's. I mean, yeah, you kind of get the point. So it's basically like a 50 50 pool. So when the market's nuke, GoP goes down less. And if the markets go up, then typically GoP goes up less.
00:06:41.550 - 00:07:17.150, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a soft hedge strategy. So, you know, I've been doing such things as buying more ether, buying more GMX, and of course, right. I guess to manage my risk, I'm doing so by using the ether as collateral and then like shorting Avax like this. And you know, when the markets go down, yes, my entire portfolio is sad, but at least I get to protect some downside. And, you know, I'm paying like a 5% interest rate to borrow Avaxen, but, you know, this position is paying me 12.5%. So I'm technically being paid to soft hedge. So that's why I call it the farmer's hedge.
00:07:17.150 - 00:07:50.580, Speaker A: Maybe I can turn that into a meme, but that's kind of how it works. And you can do this for like other money markets too, right? You can borrow ether and then short it. I mean, I don't like shorting either, to be honest, but I kind of consider Avax to be like a farm token. I don't think it's going to perform that well. If sauna and polygon is a security, then like avalanche is probably a security and has like the lowest market cap to FTV ratio. So that's kind of like my macro bearish view on Avax. And basically I'm just making a bet that the Avax e to ratio just continues to go down like this.
00:07:50.580 - 00:08:19.310, Speaker A: Right. Not great. So, no, that's kind of how it works. But yeah, like generally perpetuxes benefit off of volatility and yeah, I think these tokens will outperform the average altcoin, of course. Right. Like, I'm just saying that like, when the markets do bounce, I think these coins are going to bounce a lot harder and potentially put in new local highs or even all time highs, but that remains to be seen. So let's talk about, you know, the catalyst for GMX.
00:08:19.310 - 00:08:53.670, Speaker A: And we kind of saw this. Actually, let me just refresh this because I need some data to show. But basically how GMX works is, you know, people have been complaining about how the fees are super low and the volume is low, and that's kind of how it works when the markets are looking bearish. If there's no excitement in the markets, then no one's going to trade on leverage. And if people are losing money, then they have less money to leverage trade with. And people have been saying GMX is kind of dead. But yesterday we kind of saw this big light blue dildo and I was actually tracking this.
00:08:53.670 - 00:09:31.556, Speaker A: And this is actually one of the reasons why I was like, you know, saying, hey, like, you know, I think GMX is going to be like probably like one of the better tokens to be allocated into. So how GMX works is that, you know, when someone has a position open, they're paying like a 0.1% fee to open the position. And also they're paying like the funding rate. And the funding rate only goes to GMX stakers and GOP holders once people close the position. So the fees have been low, but that's only because there was a lot of these positions that were, like, open, that were like levered long ether that has not gone liquidated and the person hasn't really closed their position yet. So this position.
00:09:31.556 - 00:09:52.764, Speaker A: Right. So basically yesterday I was saying, hey, like, the three largest positions, GMX are about to be liquid. And if liquid, $3.5 million in fees are going to go to the platform holders. I suppose so. You know this position was getting turbo wrecked, right? This person got liquidated. This person? Yeah, I mean, yeah, like, this person is like long the top, I suppose so.
00:09:52.764 - 00:10:18.112, Speaker A: Just gone wrecked. And then this person down won't like, yeah, basically, like, not great. And, you know, if you want to, I guess I'll provide a link in the description below. But you can actually check for open positions by going to this website. It kind of looks so that you can, like, filter for size. And, you know, most people tend to be bullish. They're like, they have the bullhorns, right? They're long.
00:10:18.112 - 00:10:51.466, Speaker A: But, you know, like, most people lose money. So, like, that's kind of how the platform works. But, you know, like, those positions got absolutely annihilated, like, pretty bad, right? It's just like, yeah, I mean, I've shown this, but yeah, it's pretty bad. And, you know, like, GMX, the asset isn't only reacting that favorably. You know, you can argue that, hey, like, it's up like 3%. Well, you know, like, the majors are like, kind of flat. But, you know, like this, this is like, you know, pretty painful, right? You know, it's not great, but I do think that, you know, it could.
00:10:51.466 - 00:11:26.248, Speaker A: I mean, I'm not calling the bottom because I thought, like 50 ish dollars was like, near the bottom, but let's talk, like, why I think this could be the bottom. And I has, like, multiple reasons. Like, one is, like, fundamental in the sense that, I mean, yeah, like, you know, it's just made a bunch of fees and whenever we see these big fee candles, it kind of becomes like a shelling point for people to pay attention to. Right? It's like, oh, my God, like, GMX made a bunch of money. Oh, that's kind of cool. And then next week, the fees are going to go to GOP holders and also GMX stakers. And I think that's also going to bring incremental TVL to the platform and which also results in like more fees.
00:11:26.248 - 00:11:54.938, Speaker A: Right. So a bunch of open interest got wiped and traders got absolutely rinsed. Sorry, I keep going back and forth on this platform, but that's one of the reasons. Yeah, I guess another reason. Yeah, let's actually go here. Yeah. I mean, this thing always takes a long time to load, but I think it's like two part.
00:11:54.938 - 00:12:33.346, Speaker A: Right? I mean, first of all, the data looks good. Stick and yield, GOP holders make money. I think the GMX staking rate is going to be like 10% next week, and then maybe GOP is going to be like ping 30% or something. I mean, I'm just guessing because it kind of depends how the platform does this week, but despite us being in a bear market or whatever market, not like a bullish environment, the GOP supply, the TVL has been going up and up and up. And yes, it's kind of stagnated because volumes have been low. But if GOP is paying 30% next week, for example, then I'm sure that more people are going to pile into this position. And there's another catalyst on the horizon, right.
00:12:33.346 - 00:12:58.630, Speaker A: GMX V two, which I've talked about, it went live on Testnet on avalanche in late May, and it went live on Testnet on arbitrum on June 12. So if nothing goes wrong, we should expect V two launch to happen sometime in end of the month or sometime in July. Fingers crossed. I have no idea. Right. Because developer timelines take forever. I mean, this thing was supposed to come out like November of last year, or at least I was told.
00:12:58.630 - 00:13:27.158, Speaker A: But I think that's gonna be a catalyst because I know for a fact that they're gonna be incentivizing. I have no idea how, but they're going to be incentivizing liquidity. And we have like dozens of, maybe not dozens. We have a bunch of arbitrum defi projects that's been waiting for V two to launch to build products on top of GMX V two. And I think it's going to naturally create more farming opportunities in the future. Of course, it remains to be seen. You have to wait until the market's launched and whatnot.
00:13:27.158 - 00:14:01.678, Speaker A: But I think it has the tailwinds of the fundamentals look good, V two, right. A catalyst is on the horizon, and this really hasn't percolated yet. But I mean, it hasn't happened yet. But with coinbase and binance under scrutiny by the SEC, maybe it makes less sense for people to have significant money on these exchanges and then look into on chain perpetual dexs. And you know, GMX isn't the only one. There's the YDX, there's all these other forks and whatnot. But you know, GMX is like the most liquid place to trade out of most of these platforms.
00:14:01.678 - 00:14:33.860, Speaker A: So it should receive some incremental flow. So you know, that's kind of my bull case, I suppose, for JMX. Of course, you know, I am biased and you know, like, you know, I didn't think it would go down this much, you know, I mean, but like jokes, that's kind of the bet I'm making. And you know, to simplify where I'm at, I'm long. Yeah, I'm basically long like a basket of perpetual dexs, long ether and then I'm short avex. It's kind of like my main short to medium term strategy. It can also become a longer term strategy.
00:14:33.860 - 00:15:06.846, Speaker A: But you know, like let's worry about that once we get there. So let's talk about some farming opportunities. Right? I mean I talked about GMX, but I also want to talk about MCB, like Mux protocol. I'm not like saying that people should buy this, so again, right, I don't, I'm not necessarily saying that, but where'd it go? MCB is basically a perp Dex aggregator that also has their own GOP type of asset. So these are the metrics, right. I mean it's kind of up and down, like not too great. I'm not a huge fan of the tokenomics.
00:15:06.846 - 00:15:30.062, Speaker A: I think the tokenomics are like, like really bad. But you know, this is like their equivalent of GLP. It's on the up and up and up. They, but they also aggregate trading through GMX and GNs. So they're trying to become like the best place to trade because you can post collateral on Mux and then you can trade like, you know, they're like the most. Through their aggregator. It'll give you the best rate.
00:15:30.062 - 00:15:58.812, Speaker A: Basically it's sitting at a 50 million ish market cap charts not loading. What is it? Like a $44 million market cap. And typically aggregators have not been great investments. For example, one inch, it's a quarter of a billion dollar market cap. I think this is too high because the point of aggregators is to save you money so they can't really charge you fees and. Right. So like it really shouldn't have like that much value outside of like vc selling.
00:15:58.812 - 00:17:13.088, Speaker A: But I mean this thing is worth quarterbling. But maybe it's not good to use this as a comp because yeah, I mean like what the hell is this? But I think per text aggregators you can make a like if you're optimistic you can make a case for it. Like I'm not saying that this is gonna happen but I think how perpetexes can potentially monetize is you know if it does become like a good place to trade then some of the liquidity is gonna route through their own LPD, right? So they can maybe like most volume goes through GMX because it's like the best place to trade. But maybe some like if the open interest on GMX is too high then maybe like that demand flows to, flows through like aggregators, sorry, flows through like its own LP. And you know this is how, how they monetize and also like platforms like GMX gns, right, gains, they all have like referral codes, right? It's like hey, like use my referral code to get 10% off on trading fees and whatnot. And what mux can do, right, is have their own referral code, right, to give off the, to give discounts to traders. But there's also like rebate where like if, I mean I don't do referral codes, right? But hypothetically if I were to give you a referral code, right, to trade and you like lose money, then I get like 10% of the fees or something, right? That's kind of how it works.
00:17:13.088 - 00:18:00.310, Speaker A: And then like if more volume is being routed through aggregators some of that can flow too. The token holders, right, for the mux protocol I mean it remains to be seen. But I do think that with more forks coming and as more liquidity gets fragmented I think there's going to be more of a case to be made for aggregators, for perpetuals. And though Dex aggregators, I mean I use one inch pretty often but like I would never buy the token because there's no like no value cruel, right, for aggregators. But I think for perfs there could potentially be value cruel for aggregators because you know you can, you know direct some flow through your own LP and also maybe you know take the rebate and then just give it back to like you know token holders. And then traders benefit too because you know they get like the 10% off code or. Yeah, like they get like 10% off or something.
00:18:00.310 - 00:18:36.626, Speaker A: And if you look at the token price, I mean this is kind of interesting, right? Of course. Like, it was down only in 2021 because their product was not good. And then they pivoted, I think, in, like, September or something. But if you kind of zoom in, it's kind of been in this uptrend, like, McB, the asset. And I think, more importantly, I think denominating tokens in ether is important, because if you're not outperforming either, then what the hell? We should all be staking either and earning the 5% rate. I'm waiting for this load. But quite recently, we've seen some pretty big buys for McB.
00:18:36.626 - 00:19:03.770, Speaker A: There's been a few addresses that have gotten funded from binance and bought, like, one to 2% of the supply. And I'm not sure what's not loading. But basically, the point is, it's actually putting in higher highs. Okay, there you go. It's actually, like, you know, in an uptrend against ether, of course. Like, no, it started out from, like, a super low base, so of course it's gonna generally be uptrending. But.
00:19:03.770 - 00:19:26.230, Speaker A: Sorry. Like, I think my platform kind of. Or, like, you know, yeah, like, my laptop kind of slow. Sorry, my desktop kind of slows, um, when I'm recording. But, you know, it seems like we're in this pretty good looking uptrend. Um, you can argue, like, maybe, you know, you know, like, resistance. Resistance support.
00:19:26.230 - 00:19:45.340, Speaker A: Okay. Like, I'm not sure what's. What's wrong with, uh. Okay, okay. Resistance, resistance support. And then maybe, like, this is resistance, and, like, we're, like, bouncing off support, and, like, maybe we're going to put, like, new local highs. So, like I mentioned, I'm not a huge fan of the tokenomics, so, like, maybe no, like, you know, like, in, like, buying altcoins right now is generally scary.
00:19:45.340 - 00:20:26.172, Speaker A: But the point is, I think it's an interesting platform, and I think, you know, it's also a really interesting form. Right? So it's very similar to GLP. You can provide liquidity for MuXLP and be paid 22% ish in either and then 7% in mux. And Mux is a token that you farm, but you need to invest it over a year to turn it into MCB, which is, like, the most liquid tokenization. And, you know, it has all these assets. Right? You can have to do the math on, like, the exact composition, but it's, like, roughly 50% volatile assets and then 50% stable coins. Of course you're being exposed to a bunch of bridge risks, and it's like a multi chain thing, right? And there's like a centralized component to it.
00:20:26.172 - 00:21:14.846, Speaker A: So I mean, do your own research and whatnot. But I think, you know, there's a reasonable chance that, um, Mux LP in 2023 is going to be like GLP of 2022. Because in 2022, right, um, GLP was paying like escrow GMX and like, no, that was like, like a lifesaver, right? Like GLP, like, um, it was like one of the reasons why, like, I didn't get completely wrecked in a bear. So you can make an argument that, hey, like, if you think that per decks aggregators can potentially be a thing, and this is like the highest quality aggregator, then why not like allocate some capital here, farm it, and, you know, if the token sucks, then you can pull out whenever. But if the token is good, then, you know, like in the year 2024, you'll be investing your mux into MCB, which might have some value. So I still think that, you know, it's an interesting form to look into. So there's that.
00:21:14.846 - 00:21:58.452, Speaker A: And I'll also talk about this. So if you remember, you know, quickswap, right? Like, does anyone remember quickswap? You know, if you throw back to like the Polygon days when it was going up only. Right. You know, we see some sad patrick here, but, you know, they've been around for like three years, to be honest. They're building on top of Polygon and now they recently dropped their Zke VM. Like they dropped a perp Dex on ZkevM, right? I mean, there's so many GMX forks, it's kind of annoying, but it is what it is. But, you know, you can provide liquidity and be paid 4% in ether and 14% in quick tokens and 18% in USDC.
00:21:58.452 - 00:23:00.508, Speaker A: So, you know, they're basically compensating the yield by just like, you know, giving you like a bunch of tokens. The composition is like this, so it doesn't really go over like the math, but it's like, what, like six, eight, like roughly $900,000 of stable coins. And then, yeah, it seems like, you know, it's like a two to one ratio of like volatile assets and stable coins and maybe. Right? Like, maybe you don't feel comfortable with matic because Robin Hood's gonna nuke it and then, you know, Celsius is also gonna nuke it, but, you know, like, is it being priced in? I mean, yeah, like, people are like this shorting matic to Hadestown and you can technically do the same thing, right? I mean, I don't recommend shorting, right. But like, just for the sake of talking about it, right. You can technically use like ether s collateral, borrow matic, right, at like 5%, and then like just dump it here. But you know, like, does it make sense to shortmatic after it's already down 30% in a week? I'm not quite sure.
00:23:00.508 - 00:23:36.302, Speaker A: Maybe it makes sense as long as there's so much supply headwinds. But I still think it's a pretty interesting form. And it could be like a good way to play, I guess, polygon ZkVM, for example. So lastly, I'll just like quickly talk about a stable form. And this is on main net, so it's like not that exciting, to be honest. Yeah, and it has to be this protocol called raft. So raft is kind of like, it's not like a direct liquidity fork, but it's kind of like liquidity where you can use Etherex collateral and borrow a stable coin called R.
00:23:36.302 - 00:24:10.350, Speaker A: Liquidy only allows you to use ether as collateral, whereas raft, you can use state eth as collateral, and it's backed by wintermute jump. All these VC's, it's audited by trail of bits, which I think is like the number one auditing firm in crypto. So maybe it's less risky from that extent, David, and live like a week and TVL 45 million, yada yada. Right? So you can use stake deed, which is paying 45% right now, and then you can borrow r. I think you're paying like a 0.5%, like the last time I checked. I think their rate varies depending on market conditions, but I think it's like roughly 0.5%
00:24:10.350 - 00:24:46.760, Speaker A: what you can do. Right? So you can use stake deep disclateral borrow r, paying 0.5%. And then you can go to aura Finance and go to here, and you can put your stake coins in here and then farm Lido. So the team has a bunch of like Lido and state deed in their treasury, and they're going to compensate our liquidity or incentivize our liquidity for like the next six months. I think you have a screenshot. Yeah. So, you know, they're gonna have like $600,000 worth of incentives over a six month period, mostly in Lido.
00:24:46.760 - 00:25:10.580, Speaker A: And I think stake deed asset as well. So they're gonna be using that to incentivize liquidity for r. So yeah, I think it could be a good stable form. And even if it can be like a weighted earn yield on ether and like also boost that yield. And, you know, it seems like in terms like safety, part of the emissions are going to be reimbursed by Lido. So. And, like, Lido retweeted their launch.
00:25:10.580 - 00:25:48.810, Speaker A: So, like, maybe they're going to be like an unofficial partnership, right? Because there's also, like this protocol called labor finance that, like, pumped a lot, but, like, now it's like down only because it was like a pure farm token. I mean, in my opinion, right? Like, I'm not, like, I'm not hating on them, right. But they're saying, hey, like, you know, just be careful with these, like, new protocols and I'll share these dashboards too. And I guess also, like, you can also use raft safety than r a 50 50 ratio and then earn the staking rate. Whoops. And also be paid, what the heck? Also be paid in lido tokens. I actually think Lido is a pretty good token.
00:25:48.810 - 00:26:22.630, Speaker A: I mean, there's like bull and barricades for Lido, but if you can farm it like 1011 percent using stable coins or put like a USDC pool, right. Basically like eat stablecoin pool and be paid like 16% lido. I think that's pretty attractive. Like, not gonna lie. So I just, like, wanted to share that. And I'll also include this in the description below. But, you know, I've been trying to, like, learn parsec and they have, like, pretty interesting dashboards and you can kind of track like, the growth of rafts to the r token here.
00:26:22.630 - 00:27:21.054, Speaker A: Mean, I guess it's like, not that exciting. And, you know, Libra is like still dominating, I suppose, but, like, maybe raft is like, gonna benefit and then there's also like this where our supply, etcetera, maybe it's not that interesting, but hey, like, might as well. So to wrap up, I still like perpetaxes. I think coming out of the despair phase in crypto and altcoins, I think per Texas, notably genetics has led the markets, the defi markets, you know, to new highs or like, basically, you know, it kind of leads the defi sector. And in terms of evidence, we saw this back in June, July of 2022, post Luna and three AC, and also post FTX in November of 2022 as well. And is the same, is history going to repeat? I'm not quite sure. Of course, I'm making a bet that, you know, I think GMX will outperform if the markets do bounce.
00:27:21.054 - 00:28:02.266, Speaker A: And I do think that, like, when there's market uncertainty, any product that, you know, pays like a reliable yield that the markets generally trust, I think, you know, has stronger tailwinds and, like, you know, and whenever, you know, it makes, like, a bunch of fees within, like, 24 hours, it kind of becomes, like, a shelling point for the community to rally around. So. Okay, this thing is not loading, but. Oh, okay, sorry. Like, my desktop is really slow right now. Yeah, basically, it led the markets out of June 2022, and it also led the markets post FTX. Right.
00:28:02.266 - 00:28:22.830, Speaker A: That's kind of the point I made. So we'll see, right? We'll see. I own GMX. I own McB, and I own Pika, the Pikachu token. It's down, like, 25%, but it's more like a longer term thing. Maybe I get wrecked, but basically focusing on GMX. So thank you guys watching.
00:28:22.830 - 00:28:36.278, Speaker A: See you guys later. And if you want more content, I uploaded three videos a week in my premium discord with daily updates, so feel free to check that out if you want to. I accept crypto now, so I can do that now. So thank you guys watching. See you guys later. Bye.
