00:00:00.280 - 00:00:24.534, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And in this video, I'll be doing a fundamental analysis video for Wu trade, providing liquidity as a service. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. So the goal of this channel is, you know, I try to invest in fundamentally selling projects that will accrue value over time. And by understanding, you know, the fundamentals and what makes the product valuable, you can build conviction for your tokens.
00:00:24.534 - 00:00:57.202, Speaker A: And with conviction, you can avoid panic selling them and really catch the insane multiples that crypto can give you. As always, none of this is financial advice. And I do own Wootrad tokens as a disclosure. So this is the agenda of the video. It's quite complex and there's a lot to cover. But, you know, at the end of the video, I think you'll understand, you know, what makes Wootrad special and what distinguishes them away from the competition. So first, what is the problem that they're trying to solve? Well, for a small asset class, crypto, right? A relatively small asset class, there are hundreds of exchanges.
00:00:57.202 - 00:01:31.906, Speaker A: This leads to fragmented liquidity, where traders and buyers get worse rates. What does this mean? Well, right now there are over 500 cryptocurrency exchanges, but the entire asset class of crypto is just over $2 trillion. Right. And if you think about it, these exchanges, they can only tap into the liquidity that they have. Right? So this applies to centralized and decentralized exchanges. For example, Uniswap can only offer, you know, trading pairs that they have locked into the protocol. So you might get worse rates if you want to buy things in size.
00:01:31.906 - 00:02:04.010, Speaker A: But what if, in theory, both centralized and decentralized exchanges can tap into a central hub of liquidity? Deep, deep liquidity. That is the problem Wu trade is trying to solve. Right. So the way they do this is the Wu trade builds something called a dark pool. And the dark pool is a pool of liquidity. Centralized and decentralized exchanges can tap into to offer their customers better trade executions. And Wutrade is under Kronos.
00:02:04.010 - 00:02:28.822, Speaker A: Kronos is the parent company of Wutrade. And Kronos is a large firm based in Asia. They have roughly 100 employees, 65 of them working for Kronos, which is a high frequency market maker and quant trading firm, and 35 of them working for woo trade. So they're a legit business. It's like a, it's like a full. It's like a fully fleshed out business. And, you know, these guys are for real.
00:02:28.822 - 00:02:57.838, Speaker A: So, you know, one of the traders shared how much volume that they're doing on binance. As you can see, in the. In 30 days, Kronos, the parent company, spot, traded roughly 300,000 bitcoin and traded 450,000 bitcoin futures. Right. So these guys are not messing around like they know the business. And on FTX, they are constantly the top three in terms of volume when it comes to market makers. So this is good to see because, you know, the parent company, Coinos, they're in crypto every day.
00:02:57.838 - 00:03:34.060, Speaker A: They're trading billions of dollars of crypto every single day. They know the problem with liquidity, and they can solve it because that's what they do. So we went over the dark pool, but Kronos Research is a parent company at Wootrade, and Woo has three branches. So the dark pool is 1. Second is Woo X, and Woo X is a retail facing exchange that's going to offer zero fee trading. Lastly, there's also a thing called Wooventures, and Woo Ventures invests in projects that provide strategic value to Kronos and Woo. And the benefits from, you know, these vc type investments will be distributed to token holders.
00:03:34.060 - 00:04:29.206, Speaker A: So how does wux offer free trading? Well, to understand this, let's look at Robinhood, where, you know, Robinhood offers free trading for stocks and equities for retail investors. And if you understand Robinhood Robinhood, then you'll understand how Woox works. So let's say you want to buy 100 shares of Apple on Robinhood, right? How does it actually work on the backend? Well, you, as a customer, tells Robinhood, I want to buy 100 shares of Apple. And Robinhood doesn't go to the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq to execute this trade. No, they essentially sell your order flow to someone like Citadel, where Citadel can say, you know what? Okay, I'll front run this retail trader, and I'll pay Robinhood so I can clip this arbitrage. And that way, Robinhood earns a tiny fee and citadel earns a small arbitrage. And on the surface, as a customer, it might look like I'm getting a free trade, but nothing.
00:04:29.206 - 00:05:00.980, Speaker A: There is no free lunch, right? There is never a such thing as free trading. Someone is always making money on the backend, even though it might seem free on the surface. So this is called payment for order flow. And this is something that woox also does to offer free trading for investors. So how would woox work? Well, the answer is simple. It's literally the same thing. So take the same exact diagram as I showed you for Robinhood, and replace Robinhood with woox and citadel with the dark pool.
00:05:00.980 - 00:05:32.676, Speaker A: So if you wanted to buy one bitcoin. Right on wux. Woox will take your order, flow it through the dark pool where high frequency quant firms and trading firms or market makers can front run your bid, clip an arbitrage, pay wux in exchange for that, and you can get your crypto for zero fees. Right? Like I said, there is no such thing as a free lunch. So this seems awfully complicated. Right? There's a lot of things going on in the backend. So, you know, if Wu wants to do this, you want the team to be to have relevant experience and know what they're doing.
00:05:32.676 - 00:06:08.096, Speaker A: Well, let's take a look at the co CEO, Mark Pimentel. Well, he literally worked at Citadel, right? Like trading millions and billions of dollars every single year. So, you know, he knows how dark polls work, he knows how to talk to market makers or quant trading firms and knows their needs and demands. How about the other co CEO, Jack Tan? Well, he actually has been trading since age 14 and has over a decade of experience at Deutsche bank and BMP. How about the CTO? Right. Hopefully he knows what he's doing to. Well, yeah, he actually built out the derivatives trading and market making system infrastructure.
00:06:08.096 - 00:06:24.040, Speaker A: Right. So these guys are for real? Like I said, they're their employees from. For Kronos, right. And Kronos is one of the largest quad trading and market makers in the industry. They know the problem and they know how to solve it. So I went over the dark pools. Woo x.
00:06:24.040 - 00:06:58.598, Speaker A: What is woo Ventures? They're like a VC arm under Woo and Chronos, where they can invest in. In crypto projects that will add strategic value to Kronos and Wu trade. And whatever profits and rewards that this investment makes can be shared and distributed to token holders for Wu. So how this would work is, let's say Wu Ventures invest into a crypto startup. The startup will vest tokens back to Wu trade, which will be given back to Wu token holders depending on the agreement. And they already made one investment in Dodo. And Dodo is a decentralized exchange and aggregator.
00:06:58.598 - 00:07:28.384, Speaker A: That's one of the leading Dexs by daily volume. I believe they're on ethereum and binance smart chain. And the cool thing about dodo is that they're actually already tapping into the woo dark pool. Right. So anyone that uses Dodo can just get better liquidity because they're pulling liquidity from woo dark pool, and not just working with whatever capital they have locked up. Great. So we went over to dark pool, we went over wux and wooventures, right? They're all pretty cool.
00:07:28.384 - 00:07:54.760, Speaker A: So let's go over tokenomics to see how that part actually works. Okay, so let's look at the distribution of Wu tokens. So this is pretty much in line with what I've seen with other quality protocols. You know, 20% to the team, 5% to the advisors. You never really want to see a project that has roughly half of the tokens to investors and founders because they can just dump on you. So, you know, this seems in line with a good project. And, you know, this chart might seem confusing, so.
00:07:54.760 - 00:08:31.332, Speaker A: But don't worry. Essentially, this means that for institutions, for like, high frequency traders, quant firms and market makers, the more woo that you buy and stake, the better rates you get. So, for example, let's say you're a firm doing roughly $40 million in daily volume. Well, if you stake no tokens, then you pay 1% maker fee or 3.5% taker fee. But if you pay, or if you buy and stake two and a half million woo tokens, well, all the swaps are free, right? So there's gonna be institutional demand for woo to get better, to get better rates. And this works on the retail side as well.
00:08:31.332 - 00:09:10.570, Speaker A: So in terms of woo, for retail traders like you and I, it's sort of like BNB and FTT, where if you hold a token, you're gonna get better rates, right? You're gonna get reduced rates. And the cool thing about woo is you can also stake it as well. So you can stake it for double digit aPy, which is something that I'll be doing in the future whenever this is rolled out. And the cool thing, the really, really cool thing about woo is that according to the white paper, 50% of revenues, 50%, like half of their revenues is going to be used to buy back and burn the token. I think that's insane. So in February, they burned 5.2 million Wu, roughly $300,000.
00:09:10.570 - 00:09:38.374, Speaker A: So there's always going to be constant demand for the woo tokens, which should put a floor in the price of woo. And, you know, as more and more people use woo, the value of the token goes up. Well, as the value of tokens goes up, you know, there's, that means more and more people are using the platform. And if more and more people are using the platform, the protocol is generating more revenues. And if the protocol is generating more revenues, the protocol will be buying back more tokens. Right? Which is really cool. So we talk, went over the tokenomics.
00:09:38.374 - 00:10:20.360, Speaker A: What do they have in the roadmaps ahead, and what have they done so far to help us understand, like, if they're legit or not? So in terms of daily volume on Wu, in late February, they actually reached over $100 million in daily volume. And I think the average daily volume is around 60 million. And I got to, I got to talk to a few of the Wu traded members, like the team members, and they said that their goal is to reach a billion dollars per day in volume. And they sounded pretty confident that they're going to achieve it. And given their connections, given their backgrounds, I think that's definitely possible. Lastly, this is the b two b Wu Chi network growth by a month. As you can see, it's going up into the right.
00:10:20.360 - 00:10:45.376, Speaker A: This just means more institutions are tapping into the dark pool. So that's high frequency trading, quant firms and market makers. And this is the roadmap for the rest of 2021. They're going to launch Woo X and staking this quarter. I don't know when, but I hope so soon. Apparently in Q three, they're going to roll out futures and a mobile application. And Q four, staking for asset management.
00:10:45.376 - 00:11:18.400, Speaker A: I'm not sure what that means, but I'll be looking forward to, you know, all these features that, you know, Wu token holders will be able to enjoy in the future. So we went over all these things, but, you know, do they have any competition? Right? That's always important. Well, I think one of the biggest competition that they have in the Defi space is Orion protocol. They're a top 200 project with $300 million market cap with a 1.5, fully 1.5 billion fully diluted. And if, you know, if you look at the website, you see this, right? You see all these partners, you know, it's pretty cool.
00:11:18.400 - 00:11:57.562, Speaker A: Like, oh, my God, like, how can woo ever overtake these guys? They seem to have a relatively big moat. But if you look at the team, it's a bunch of engineers, it's a bunch of smart people that, you know, are really passionate about crypto. And I'm sure that, you know, they're great people and I'm sure that they're very, very smart. But, you know, ask yourself when, if you were to invest in a protocol that's gonna provide dark pools and, you know, better, liquidity, would you rather invest these guys or, you know, these guys, right? I don't know about you, but my money is with Mark, Jack and Terrence. Right. And not Alexei. Like, sorry, Alexei, I don't know who you are.
00:11:57.562 - 00:13:04.160, Speaker A: I'm sure you're a great guy, but, yeah, I'm not gonna put money towards Orion protocol woo all the way. I think the bigger. I think the bigger competition, right. The biggest risk that woo faces is what if a centralized exchange like Binance and Coinbase, instead of tapping into woo's liquidity, what if they make a dark pool of their own? Binance actually processes 33%, roughly 33% of all crypto transactions right now, which is huge, right? Binance is a major player in Coinbase, which they're going to direct list IPO soon, I think roughly holds 11% of crypto assets. So instead of worrying about Orion or other DeFi protocols, if you're a Wu token holder, I'll be looking more carefully into what Binance and Coinbase has in mind when it comes to providing liquidity aggregation or dark pools. So, with all that being said, wu trading roughly a dollar right now, I still think it is a pretty good investment. None of this financial advice, but I'm just going to be averaging in anything below two to $3.
00:13:04.160 - 00:13:35.590, Speaker A: The fully diluted is 3 billion, which might seem like a lot, but if you think about the problem that they're trying to solve and, you know, all their. All the products that they're going to roll out, right? There's woo dark pool, there's the woo X and Woo Ventures. All that combined, I can totally see this being over a $10 billion project. I don't know about you, but, you know, I'm very bullish on woo. I'll be staking it as soon as the staking product goes live. And, yeah, that's the end of the video.
