00:00:01.080 - 00:00:12.270, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. Welcome to the state of DeFi Report for April. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. Link to the premium discord description below as well. So let's get right into it. So this is gonna be the agenda of the video.
00:00:12.270 - 00:00:59.750, Speaker A: Let's talk about the shipple upgrade and the echo bubble and talk about the me seasonality and reasons to start being a little bit more cautious. Then I'll talk about Trader Joe, the metrics behind Trader Joe, how it looks like really killing it, and talk about future narratives that might pop off in the defi markets, as well as know my general view on the altcoin. So, non essential advice, let's talk about the chapel upgrade. You know, before the actual hard fork. I think, you know, if you asked around, probably like seven out of ten people probably would have told you that this was going to be a bearish event, right? Or like a neutral to bearish event. But obviously, like, as the upgrade happened and even before the upgrade, like, we were like pumping into Chappella and even after Chappelle, like, we just like, you know, keep putting in these green candles. And it's been a while since I've seen a three handle on bitcoin and a two handle on Ethereum, like above 30k, above two k.
00:00:59.750 - 00:01:27.182, Speaker A: And it's like, wow. Like, it's. It's been a while since I felt this way. Like I. Even as a crypto bull, I'm still in this, you know, phase of disbelief. And, you know, also, like, these lse tokens, like, you know, are also going crazy. So let's think about, like, why this happened, because, like, how, like, why are people buying into this, right? Like, shouldn't this be a bearish event? Like, aren't these Eid whales gonna withdraw their eid? Like, you know, they're gonna dump it on, like, on my face.
00:01:27.182 - 00:02:07.760, Speaker A: Like, why? Why are we pumping into this? And I think this is like a lesson that we constantly learn in crypto. And it's the fact that I have no idea what it is about the crypto markets and people in crypto, but people just get way too bearish or way too bullish ahead of certain events that everyone knows about. And I've talked about how, you know, everything in crypto that is perceived as bullish is almost always sell the news. Because if, like, if the entire market knows about a particular event and, you know, can't position themselves ahead of time, then anyone that wanted to buy a particular token will have. Would have already bought. So when the actual event actually happens, then, like, there's, like, no one left to buy. So, like, that's why it's always sell the news.
00:02:07.760 - 00:02:47.758, Speaker A: And then I raise this question of, like, okay, like, well, if it's pretty much consensus that, you know, Shanghai is going to be a bearish event, like, like, wouldn't that be, like, a sell the rumor by the news event where anyone that wanted to sell probably would have sold before the event because, like, I'm gonna sell ether because people are gonna dump on me. Time to just the risk ahead of the event. And also, you have to think about this element where there's a bunch of people that don't really have that much crypto exposure. They were looking to buy any dip that comes from Shanghai, right, this. This hard fork. And they were asking themselves, you know what? Like, I don't have, like, that much crypto exposure, but I'm gonna wait until April or May. So if we see a dip from Chappella from Shanghai, I'm gonna buy that dip.
00:02:47.758 - 00:03:08.182, Speaker A: So if there is no dip, then what are these people gonna do? And maybe that's, like, what we're seeing now. Maybe it's a short squeeze. To be honest, I have no idea what's happening. Anyone that tells you they know what's happening has no idea, or they're, like, lying to you, because I honestly have no idea. My mindset is 2022. Super bearish, super sad. So much PTSD.
00:03:08.182 - 00:03:21.560, Speaker A: 2023. It's going to be if you do an accumulation year, recovery year. So just buy things you like and just hold on to it, right. And earn yield while you can't. Like, that's kind of my mindset. I'm not, like, really trying to complicate things too much. It's like, you know, if you're bearish.
00:03:21.560 - 00:03:47.818, Speaker A: Sorry, if you're bullish, crypto, like, you know, like, are you. Are we really in this game of, like, selling ether at two k to buy back at 1700? Like, what if it doesn't get there? It's like, I'm not smart enough of that. Like, let's just, you know, just have a general strategy and stick to it. And, you know, I think with this upgrade, it just shows us that positioning. Right. How the market positions ahead of an event is way more important than whatever catalyst is bullish or bearish. You know, it's like, if you think about, like, the solidly.
00:03:47.818 - 00:04:18.120, Speaker A: Right, the phantom season solidly, it's like I was like, bearish solidly, but, like, everyone's hyping it up. And then when solidly actually launches, like, everything goes down. And that's the case for arbitrary two. It's like everyone anticipates arbitrageum multi season post airdrop. Everyone buys these altcoins, but when the actual airdrop happens, it's like, am I really gonna take my arbitrum token, dump it for like, altcoins? Probably not. And we kind of see like the celtic news happen over and over again. But I guess like for consensus bearish events, it's gonna be like seldom use packet rumor type events.
00:04:18.120 - 00:04:51.108, Speaker A: I wrote the squiggle in my last video. I felt like, you know, Shanghai probably gonna be a good place for eat BTC. The bottom, I will say that, you know, like eth withdrawals being live, it's like it for sure will introduce some incremental sell pressure. But you can't always just think about like the supply side. You also have to think about the demand side. And you know, even like bitcoins, like being sold by the government, like Mount Gox and whatnot. But, you know, people like, there are just way more buyers than like whatever, incremental buyer, sorry, incremental sellers are left in the markets.
00:04:51.108 - 00:05:32.264, Speaker A: And, you know, as it goes, like, you know, when I look at bitcoin, I'm like an EBT Siebel, right? I think that's pretty clear. I literally have a Defi channel. But I started out as a bitcoin maxi, and I do think that it's important to always not get too caught up in this pure ether, pure defi, pure NFT mindset. I think bitcoin is leading us out of this bear market. And I think the narrative around digital gold is very, very important. So on the left hand side here, you see the chart for gold, the weekly chart in zero eight, 2008 2009 in a post financial crisis. And on the right hand side here, you see gold, the weekly chart.
00:05:32.264 - 00:06:17.194, Speaker A: I guess for the past couple of years and after the whole Cyclone Valley bank fallout, gold is really pushing for all time highs. And the price action here, it really looks similar to what we're seeing here. The question you have to ask yourself is, if gold hits 2200, hits all time highs, what's that going to do to the price of bitcoin? I mean, it's just a narrative, right? Like, there's no reason for bitcoin to trade in line with gold. But I do think that as bitcoin enters the zeitgeist, it's in the mind share for millions of people. If people are looking. Or if the older people, if the boomers are showing gold to their clients, then I'm sure that the younger audience, they're going to say, you know what? I don't want to buy gold. I'll just buy bitcoin or something.
00:06:17.194 - 00:06:57.060, Speaker A: And then that money should slowly trickle down into ether, defi NFT, altcoins. And I guess that's why we're in this space, right? Like, we did not endure a brutal 2022 bear market just to get footed out because there's been so many fud events, right? Like USDC, Cyclone Valley bank, the wells notice for Lido, Coinbase, kraken being sued, binance being sued, like, whatever. Like, you know, there's, like, so many reasons for the markets to go down, but the markets have continued to climb a wall of worry. And I think how price reacts to news is how the markets like to show their hand. And I think we are in the beginning of an uptrend. I'm not saying up only. And they'll talk about, like, my reasons to be cautious around these levels.
00:06:57.060 - 00:07:47.066, Speaker A: But, hey, like, you know, just don't lose sight of the big picture. And, you know, people have been calling for bitcoin dominance, but, you know, I don't really see that much upside for bitcoin dominance above 55%. You know, like, I have a fat position of tricrypto, and I think tricrypto, right, it's an lp token, right? 33% bitcoin, 32% ether, 33% stable coins. I think it's like an eth maxis way of hedging against bitcoin dominance. But, you know, if bitcoin just continues to, I guess, dominate the entire markets around, like, this, the red square, I'm probably gonna just, like, pull out of tricrypto, and that could just be like, you know, super heavy ether and probably ride that for, like, the next couple of years, to be honest. Now, let's talk about the echo bubble thesis, right? And the may seasonality. And this is, like, my reasons for being relatively cautious right now, despite, I mean, like, I'm like a bull, but, like, I'm still in the disbelief phase.
00:07:47.066 - 00:08:26.622, Speaker A: And this echo bubble is this concept of, you know, crypto follows four year cycles with the bitcoin having and, you know, following the 2018 bear market. In 2019, we literally went up only for six months, you know, pretty crazy run before just, like, withering away for the latter half of the year. And now people are saying, hey, like, you know, same thing, right? Four year cycle, 2019 2023 mirror this thing, let's pump into June, and then let's sell into May. Sell into June and go away. There's no fundamental reason for why this should happen, but it is happening, maybe because crypto is super reflexive. And if people believe that certain things will happen, it will just naturally manifest itself. It's a very reflexive asset class.
00:08:26.622 - 00:09:16.230, Speaker A: It's really hard to value crypto tokens, so it's more dependent on how people are feeling. It's all about the vibes, if I were to be completely honest. Um, it's kind of freaky, right? It's kind of freaky. Um, but it seemed like, like, will this repeat? Um, I had mentioned this two months ago that, hey, like, I think this can happen, but if it does happen and people start really, like, you know, like, you know, pumping it, I do think it makes sense to start thinking about selling in April and May. The concept is if people expect it to pump into June, then people will think about selling in June. But, like, I guess, like, the smarter people, it's like, maybe not smarter money, but, like, you know, like, to. If you think about their score, it's like, if we're pumping into May, why not sell into May? But if everyone thinks that, then why not sell in April and just have a general de risking strategy? That's kind of the concept.
00:09:16.230 - 00:10:10.098, Speaker A: I don't really believe in seasonality stuff, but the data doesn't lie. And I think as crypto matures as an asset class, it becomes more traded by institutions, larger players. I do think that legacy correlation is relatively important just to be aware of. And there's this concept of selling million go away, where generally from the period from May to October, on average, over the past couple of decades, the average return is roughly 2% for the s and P, whereas from November to April, it's roughly 7%. So people generally, I have no idea. Maybe people go on summer vacations and it's more pronounced in the Dow Jones industrial average. But, you know, there's, like, this consensus seasonality thing of, you know, just from May to October, just chill out, maybe raise cash, maybe like, buy treasuries, go for those yields.
00:10:10.098 - 00:10:46.378, Speaker A: And it's just something to be aware of because I took the liberty of looking at the bitcoin price, and in the red box, it highlights every single, like, I guess, like, the price action of bitcoin for the month of May. And I guess, like, what people are looking at is like, okay, like, if we're going to see nicobubble, like, maybe we pump into May. Right. But if you look into the other years, that's not really how it works. And I think the adage of selling megaway actually works in crypto, even though there's no real fundamental reason for why this should happen. Of course, in 2017, we were up only. But I mean, 2017, I don't think we're in the 2017 market conditions.
00:10:46.378 - 00:11:15.682, Speaker A: So let's look at the other months or other years. In 2018, you pumped it into May in the bear market and just retraced it all. Really, really brutal price action. And then 2019, right, just like up only. And in 2020, which I think is, like, where, you know, maybe it's like, a good analogy, right? Where we're at is we had the COVID crash, right? In like, February, March. We went up only until May. And then, you know, it was like the bitcoin having in 2020 was sort of a self news event.
00:11:15.682 - 00:11:39.044, Speaker A: We basically went sideways for a couple of months before, you know, like, really going parabolic. And in 2021 after this parabolic rally, we had the chinese Bitcoin Miner fund. Like in Tesla selling bitcoin, all that. And, you know, like, this was like, when I woke up and my portfolio was down, was like, down 30%, and I was like, oh, my God, like, did I get liquidated? Mobi. Right. That's literally, like, how I was feeling at the time. I'm sure some of you can relate.
00:11:39.044 - 00:12:18.956, Speaker A: If you were in the markets back then and then in 2022, that was basically when, you know, Luna collapsed. And then in June, like, three ac collapsed, and that kind of, like, led to the selling crescendo. And I do think that, you know, we've bottomed to in November when FTX happened and there were, like, no, like, no incremental sellers after FTX. And just looking at this, maybe it makes sense, like, you know, de risk in, you know, starting in may, right? But, like, like, when I say de risk, I'm not saying, like, hey, let's go 100% cash. Like, go short. I'm just saying, hey, like, if you own a bunch of altcoins, like, maybe, like, you know, favor the majors, favor LP tokens, maybe think about hedging. Maybe think about this raising cash.
00:12:18.956 - 00:13:05.756, Speaker A: And don't get too euphoric, right? Like, because if you think about, like, the higher price goes, the risk reward gets a little bit worse, of course, over, like, a five year time horizon, like, you know, 30k bitcoin, two k, like, pretty good entries, but we're not really trying, like, you know, or, you know, if you're watching this video, you sort of care about short term price action. And to be honest, like, I don't really expect, like, a crazy dump. Maybe we see some correction. I think the most likely outcome is something like in 2020, wherever, after a face melting rally, after, like, a crazy sell off, maybe we just consolidate for a few months before resuming the uptrend in the latter half of 2023. Early Q, early 2024, especially with the bitcoin having. That's kind of like my most likely outcome. But, hey, you know, just, just let's think about de risking strategies, right? Yeah.
00:13:05.756 - 00:13:55.700, Speaker A: So let's think about, I guess, like, ways to reduce volatility in your portfolio, especially because on chain fundamentals haven't looked that great for a while, even since the loading collapse. So the red line is a stable coin market cap, and it just really hasn't gone up. And especially with the whole USDCD peg. It's like, maybe people feel less confident about the on chain markets, but crypt price is still going up despite this happening. So maybe it's literally people not buying things on chain, but, hey, just depositing money fiat to a centralized exchange and buying coins on decentralized exchanges. So maybe it's reasonable to expect coins listed on centralized exchanges to outperform, like, things that are purely on chain. But, hey, like, you know, over the next six months, you're gonna make way more money buying things on chain than things off chain, you know, on average, of course.
00:13:55.700 - 00:14:29.654, Speaker A: And in terms of, like, retail activity, maybe this isn't, like, the best indicator, because, you know, I only make videos, like, once a month now, not because I'm lazy or something, but these videos take a long time to make, and I don't want to make more videos for the sake of making these videos. And, you know, every time I upload a video, I have subscribers. And it doesn't seem like that many people are interested in defi. And, you know, like, let's be real. Like, you know, it's really hard for Defi to compete with, like, one of your treasuries when they're yielding, like four, four and a half, 5%. It's totally reasonable. And, you know, even like, YouTube, right? It's like, you only lost 550 subscribers in the past 90 days.
00:14:29.654 - 00:15:15.424, Speaker A: You're doing a great job, right? Like, you know, it's giving me this Green Arrow, or it's giving you a thumbs up sign. And, I mean, at some point, this trend has to shift, right? At some point, people have to stop unsubscribing. I mean, maybe, right? Like, who knows, like, maybe like, my videos aren't that great, but, like, at some point, like, you know, higher prices should lead to more interest. But, like, defi itself still in this relative bear market, I guess, of course, we're seeing, like, certain sectors do really well. But on average, I think that on chain altcoins have been suffering for quite some time now. And unless this trend shifts, unless the coins come back online, you know, I think it's reasonable to be cautious. But of course, right, like, maybe the bull case is, I mean, prices are going up despite people not being interested.
00:15:15.424 - 00:16:18.798, Speaker A: At some point, people are going to become interested, they're going to start coming back, and then anyone that's positioned right now, they're going to reap the benefits. So, you know, there's like, many different ways to slice the pie. But, you know, I also can, like, feel myself, like, looking for reasons to sell. I'm not like that close to popcorn curvy, but we had like, this good banter where it's like, you know, we all feel this 2022 PTSD, it's like, do we deserve higher prices? It feels surreal that prices are going up. Like, you know, like, how can in this macro environment, like, how can this happen, right? Like, I listen to so many macro podcasts, it's like, how can, like, you know, how can they allow this to happen? And, you know, I'm like, looking for reasons to sell. It's like the whole selling Mei and go away thing, it's like something that I looked into and I'm like, yeah, like, maybe I should sell it into may, right? Like, you know, there's like no fundamental reason for why I should do it, but I just feel like this PTSD at the back of my mind saying, hey, like, you know, tyche, like shit, sell, sell, right? It's like, hey, like, you know, like we're bound to go down. But, you know, I think throwing away the bear market PTSD, I think you have to view this year as a recovery, accumulation year.
00:16:18.798 - 00:16:50.420, Speaker A: Look at the big picture, right? It's like, did we really endure 2022 just to, like, you know, sell bitcoin at 30K? Probably not. I'm not a trader. I'm not gonna over trade. I'm not smart enough for that. So for me, I'm just like, hey, let's find coins I like and hold onto them, right? Don't over trade. And if I want to de risk, maybe I prioritize LP tokens. And I think about hedging strategies because I maintained for quite some time now that I do think that, hey, like, I mean, I said this back in December, right? I think LP tokens, like shared crypto and GLP, they're gonna outperform one year treasuries.
00:16:50.420 - 00:17:34.931, Speaker A: And then I guess, like, the mindset is like, hey, like, why would anyone buy crypto when people can earn four to 5% clipping one of your treasuries? Well, like, you know, like, maybe right? Like, maybe right. That's like a bare case for defi. But no, crypto, I think, is in a secular bull market. And I do think it pays more to be bullish than bearishen. And I do think that tricrypto GOP is, like, my way of looking at the crypto store value. Of course, you can buy vue, bitcoin, and ether as store value, but from a risk management perspective, I don't feel uncomfortable holding the majority of my portfolio into these LP tokens. Once a week, I look at the yield, and I'm like, oh, some guys, they get off on porn.
00:17:34.931 - 00:17:57.312, Speaker A: I just look at my yields on a weekly basis, and I'm like, oh, yeah. Like, you know, this. This really gets me going. Arbitrum on comdex pays 23%, you know, 33% tether, 33% bitcoin, 33% ether. It's a good way because, you know, it, like, automatically rebalances. So if bitcoin goes up, then the pool will. No, I mean through, like, I guess, in permanent loss, it's gonna sell some bitcoin into ether, stable coins, et cetera.
00:17:57.312 - 00:18:23.168, Speaker A: And it's like a. You know, it's like a good way to, like, rebalance your portfolio, right? Like, you just, like, pile money into tricrypto, and it's gonna automatically, for you, you're gonna renew the swap fees, etcetera. And then GLP, you know, pays 20% consistently. There's always fud, right? There's like, you know, there's like, techy haters saying, hey, like, you know, you're gonna go to zero. But, hey, like, in GLP. I've held GLp in GMX for over a year now. And, hey, like, it's done so well, right? It gave me the arm token.
00:18:23.168 - 00:18:57.696, Speaker A: Airdrop gives me capital appreciation. It's great. I will say that Gemx, synthetix, they're gonna come soon. And I was looking at the documentation, and it's. It's gonna allow for more assets to be listed. So, for example, they can list things like Solana, right? Because right now, GOP can't list these assets. And then I was like, okay, like, how is this going to work? Like, how is this going to tie in the GOP? And I was asking one of their team members, he's like, hey, like, is GOP still going to be around or is it going to be like, you know, separate, et cetera? And he mentioned that GOP is not going to be integrated into v two and v two will have isolated pools for each pair.
00:18:57.696 - 00:19:17.830, Speaker A: So it's going to be similar to, I guess, uniswap, where if you want to trade bitcoin, you go through the bitcoin pool. Right? I mean, which pretty obvious. And I was like, wait, but like, one of the beauties of GMX, I guess, is like, is GOP, because GOP definitely has probably a fit. And what did that fragment? Liquidity. Yes. And he acknowledges that. Or is she right here? But LP's will also be taking on less risk.
00:19:17.830 - 00:19:54.538, Speaker A: And it seems like GOP and these isolated pools will run simultaneously over some time, but at some point GOP is probably going to be sunset, which kind of makes me sad. But who knows? Like, maybe, you know, like the team knows. I mean, yeah, the team definitely knows better than me. And maybe like, the ETh USDC pool is going to yield like 40%, like a year from now and it's going to be like de facto way to, I guess, LP on chain. So I know, still bullish GMX, still bullish GLP. But I guess, like, the thing is, if you have escrow GMX, maybe start vesting them, right? Because I have no idea what's going to happen if they do decide to get rid of GOP. It's probably not going to happen like anytime soon.
00:19:54.538 - 00:20:18.806, Speaker A: But hey, just start thinking about this if you care. So I guess, like, you know, if you want to be risk on while still, like thinking about, like, downside risk, I think LB tokens, right? You have the stablecoin volatility reduction. I guess, like, you know, it stabilizes your portfolio to some extent. Of course, if the markets pump, then you underperform either. But hey, like, that's the trade off. You take, right? Or you make right. And then I guess for hedging strategies.
00:20:18.806 - 00:21:02.040, Speaker A: I've been talking about this for some time now and I think it's starting to manifest itself. And I guess, like, I'm not like, really bullish on the avant eth ratio and, you know, if I do decide to take off my bitcoin hedge and like, you know, I go full into ether and whatnot, of course that's gonna increase the volatility of my portfolio. But what I can do is I can short avax against my collateral so that, hey, like, I get to protect my downside, but also cap my upside. So, like, my strategy, which I've been doing since last year, you know, on and off, is, you know, something is collateral. Borrow avax by GOP. And I think Avax can reasonably pump into the avalanche summit happening in two to three weeks. And I talked about this hedge zone, right? Roughly $20 to $50.
00:21:02.040 - 00:21:27.106, Speaker A: I mean, I don't think it's gonna get much higher unless we enter, like, a full blown bull. But, hey, like, in that case, like, even if I'm short Avax, I'm gonna be totally okay, because, like, the rest of my portfolio will probably be doing much better. And this is an Abax eth ratio. Nothing against Avax team. My friend works there. You know, I respect anyone that works at Eva Labs, and I respect builders in general. But the token itself, it seems like it's bleeding.
00:21:27.106 - 00:22:09.198, Speaker A: And, like, I don't feel like, you know, I. I feel comfortable, like, you know, longing either. Shorting daybacks against it, and then, like, just, like, doing various yield strategies there. Yeah. So, like, the idea isn't, like, just to be, like, full on short, but the idea I'm trying to push is, hey, just buy coins you like, and if you want to protect downside, you can short something like Avax if you are bearish to avax eth ratio. Yes, you cap your upside, because if bitcoin was 40k, maybe avalanche at dollar 30, and you lose money on the hedge. But I guess if you're long in general, then whatever money you lose on the hedge will be made up for more than made up for by whatever upside left in the crypto markets.
00:22:09.198 - 00:22:42.416, Speaker A: And there's this avalanche summit happening May 3. And I'm probably gonna. I mean, if Avax comes into this, I'm probably gonna start scaling into these shorts, because in 2022, there was a summit in late March, and we pumped into the event before, I guess, like, really collapsing. I'm not expecting the same thing to happen. I expect Avax be ranging for the next year or so, and I'm, like, happy to just collect the yield while I'm at it. One thing that's concerning is that on Avalanche, the Aave supply cap or the borrow cap for Avax has been hit. So I can't really borrow Avax.
00:22:42.416 - 00:23:13.102, Speaker A: So I might have to figure something else out, because this really makes me sad. But there's this other money market, if you remember, right, banki you can borrow Avax here. But in a bear market, it's really hard for me to deploy capital into new projects in size. I just get PTSD. Even like Euler finance the money market with like twelve audits would like raise VC Capital. They recently got exploited, they got their money back, but it's not like a good time for like anyone that like lost money temporarily. So just an idea.
00:23:13.102 - 00:23:38.506, Speaker A: Maybe it's not viable due to like if you're like a risk averse person with the evacs, borrow caps. But hey, an alternative is benky and I might do that soon. So that's enough about bitcoin, ether, Metro talk, hedging talk, right? I'm sure that most people want me to talk about altcoins, so let's talk about that. So Trader Joe has been doing really well. It's one of the biggest beneficiaries from the arbitrageum token airdrop. And I was like, okay, like there's so much hype. Let's do an experiment.
00:23:38.506 - 00:24:44.552, Speaker A: So what I did was, well, like in order for Joe to really appreciate in value, it really has to take some market share away from uniswap, right? So I was like, okay, like how's the best way to test this? Well, why not? Like why don't I just make the same ranges for arbitrary USDC and do a side by side experiment of Trader Joe, right? LP on trader Joe versus LP on uniswap. And, and if I make more money on Trader Joe then that's super, super bullish and I will hand over fist buy these Joe tokens and yeah, I mean, yeah, like Joe upon me, it's like the only, it's one of the few tokens that like really benefited from the orbit from token Airdrop because every other Arabtrome native altcoin like kind of like pumped and dumped and I guess they're pumping recently, but I'm not really like, I'm not a huge fan of those altcoins they are shipping right there. I really like the team, I really respect the team. I talked to them quite some time. They're going to introduce revenue share with estro, right? So maybe that can be like a narrative, right? It's not a worthless governance token. You can actually be paid yield. Right now it's only available in Avalanche.
00:24:44.552 - 00:25:11.318, Speaker A: But there's also like this automated liquidity strategies via auto pools, maybe. That's interesting. I'm still of the belief that I think most LP's in crypto are going to be on the more sophisticated side and they're not going to use automated liquidity managers. But, like, who knows? Like, maybe as more protocols for QNDB three, like, we can kind of see, like, more of these protocols start to develop. Yeah. So let's talk about liquidity book 2.1. It's a twist on unity b three.
00:25:11.318 - 00:25:28.886, Speaker A: It's not a direct fork, but it kind of works the same way. And let's talk about the experiment. So, okay, let's set the same ranges and, you know, and see, like, how much money I make. So trader Joe has a 0.8 and 0.2% people, and Uniswap has a 1% and a 0.3% people.
00:25:28.886 - 00:25:55.900, Speaker A: So I just kind of ran this simulation or experiment side by side, and I'm like, okay, like, let's do this. So let's do a dollar 21 to a dollar 45 range. And I did this March 29. So I took my arbitram single sided, deposited for this range. And if people buy arbitrum and it enters the range, then people are going to be trading in and out of my pool, and they'll be collecting transaction fees. And I guess, like, the verdict is, like, how much money I make, like, ultimately. So March 29, I did this.
00:25:55.900 - 00:26:14.576, Speaker A: On the right hand side. Here, you see uniswap. Left hand side, you see arbitrary. Sorry, arbitrage. And initially, you can add this number up. Yeah, I think this was, like, late March, but this was, you can add, like, the deposit balance and the fee balance. So it's like $1,421 roughly.
00:26:14.576 - 00:26:46.428, Speaker A: And then on the install, I made $1,426 ish, right. So it seems like I make more money. I'll pay when you saw fee three. But just keep in mind, like, take this with a grain of salt. It's like, this is, like, super tiny, right? Like, I mean, it's purely an experiment, but maybe it's insightful and interesting. You, and then a couple days later collected more fees. Maybe you can say, hey, I made $1,445 on Trader Joe and then $1,455 on uniswap.
00:26:46.428 - 00:27:10.720, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess experiment one, I think uniswap wins. Okay. You're much better off helping on uniswap over Trader Joe. And I guess, like, for an explanation of what happened, I deposited arbitrary. Yeah. So I think the price of, like, arbitrary was like a dollar 19. And I'm like, okay, like, let me just sell into it right into dollar 45, where, you know, if arbitrum goes over 145, my pool will be 100% USDC plus whatever fees I earned.
00:27:10.720 - 00:27:34.028, Speaker A: And you can kind of think of this as, hey, like DCA out of arbitrum between 125 to 145 and collect any transaction fees. And then on April 3, after running this for like a week or so, it seems like it get like, you know, this first experiment favors univ threes, 1% pools, over 0.8% pools for Trader Joe. Cool. But hey, like, that's. I only did it for like a week. Let's do another experiment.
00:27:34.028 - 00:27:54.154, Speaker A: So on April 3, arbitrageum went down. So I did the same thing for a dollar 20 to dollar 40 for these two people. And you can see it here. And this was yesterday before arbitram, like literally pumped like into the moon. You can kind of see that on the bank. I'm making more money on uniswap over trade. And then this morning I took the screenshots.
00:27:54.154 - 00:28:19.902, Speaker A: So, you know, because arbitrum is like a dollar 50 something right now. My poll is completely USDC, right? So I dcA'd out of arbitrum into USDC and I collected whatever transaction fees from this pool. And hey, Univ three makes more money or LP on Unity V. Three makes more money than LP on Trader Joe. Like, why is that? Because I'll talk about the liquidity book 2.1 design later. And I do think it's actually offers significant advantages.
00:28:19.902 - 00:29:04.424, Speaker A: So, like, why do I make more money on Uni b three? I think the simple answer, the explanation is that if you look at the 24 hours volume and even like, I guess like the seven day volume, it's like basically 50% of volume on decent sized exchanges goes through Uniswap. And there's like this uniswap, sorry, Delphi report that was launched July 27, where it went over. Like, you know, if people use aggregators, like, more trades should be routed through curve and other dexes because it's more capital efficient. However, the truth is uni v three just gets way more trade volume, and llps just make more, more and more in fees. Because most crypto people, they don't use aggregators. They don't really check for the best price execution. They literally just go to uniswap.org
00:29:04.424 - 00:29:32.090, Speaker A: and like, click the buy and sell button. So naturally, if that's the, the nature of human behavior in people within crypto, then, you know, LP should naturally be incentivized to LP on UDP three. So I think that's like the harsh truth about LP's right now and dexs. But who knows? Like, maybe the trend shifts more in Trader Joe's favor with these liquidity book improvements. Like I said, take this with a grain of salt. Like, I am really famous. I'm really known for missing out on Joe pumps.
00:29:32.090 - 00:29:52.830, Speaker A: If you remember, right back in, like, August of 2021, I was super early into evacs. I bought evacs. I bought penguin, right, instead of Joe. And all my friends made a ten x on Joe, where I made a humble two to three x on Penguin. And that was a very sad camper. So I'm really, like, bad at, like, making money off of Joe. I don't even know own Joe right now, despite it going up, and my friends are happy.
00:29:52.830 - 00:30:15.390, Speaker A: Anyways, maybe, like, this is an interesting experiment, but let's talk about the liquidity book 2.1. So this is, like. I think it's, like, an actual innovation when it comes to, like, you know, concentrated liquidity. If you know me, like, I'm. I love uni v three. I think univ three is, like, one of the most beautiful protocol designs I've ever seen. Right? Like, trying to replicate a central limit order protocol on chain by introducing different ranges.
00:30:15.390 - 00:30:37.994, Speaker A: I think that's beautiful. But the thing is, like, you saw here, the uniswap fees, they accrue separately, right? Yeah. Like, you know, the fees, they're like, I guess they're separated and you have to claim them. And it doesn't really auto compound back into the actual pool, but that's kind of what trader Joe or liquidity book 2.1 does. So this is, like, not my LP, but someone else's LP, but they Lp for Joe Avax. Right.
00:30:37.994 - 00:31:15.652, Speaker A: The advisory was, like, you know, like, one night. And how it works is with v two one or. Yeah, whatever fees that gets generated within these. Within these bins, it gets auto compounded back into wherever the trade happens. So, like, 24 hours later, this is, like, what the shape look like, you know, compared to this. So, ideally, right? Like, if you think about it like, this shouldn't make for more capital efficient LP, because as more and more trade happens within, like, a certain range, the fees go back into that range. Therefore, you're gonna have more of a more share of your LP within particular.
00:31:15.652 - 00:31:41.136, Speaker A: I mean, I'm not sure if, like, people, like, truly understand how cons really, really works, but I do think that it's, like, pretty innovative. And, no, I do like Joe. I don't own Joe. But hopefully this gives you a good insight of the innovations happening within Defi, because people talk shit about defi all the time. It's like, whatever. But, hey, devs are building, the devs are doing something. And when the devs do something, price goes up.
00:31:41.136 - 00:31:58.274, Speaker A: Whoa. Crazy stuff. Yeah. So liquidity book to bring one auto compound fees back into the pool, which should increase the efficiency of your LP positions. And with stake, Joe, I guess, v two, they're going to implement a 25% fee. So for the 0.8% fee pool, they're going to take 0.2%
00:31:58.274 - 00:32:29.110, Speaker A: to SGL stakers, which. Which might be something promising, to be honest. I guess, like, the argument against this is like, you know, because Uniswap has no revenue share, right? So it's really competitive for LP's. So if Joe takes a 25% fee, then I'm, like, more inclined to go to uniswap, right, if I. I want to be an LP, but who knows? Like, let's wait for the data. And the data for data will speak for itself, you know, like, it's been up only. But in the grand scheme of things, like, if they can actually compete with Uniswap, can't they be a multi billion dollar protocol? I think so.
00:32:29.110 - 00:32:52.620, Speaker A: Right. Especially if they can introduce revenue share. But, hey, you know, this is something to consider. So let's talk about other altcoins and future narratives. I'm going to go pretty fast. I'll provide some resources in the description below. Yeah, but, you know, like, the ultimate markets have been doing that well, right? Bitcoin dominance going up, either dominance going up on chain markets have been pretty stagnant, maybe because of the whole USDC thing and, you know, the lack of retail coming back.
00:32:52.620 - 00:33:20.170, Speaker A: You know, we've talked about this before, and also my YouTube metrics, I guess, feels like there's a lot of anxiety when it comes to all coins. Like, I mean, I feel this too, right? It's like, I own all coins. They go up in price, but it's like. It's like. Like, oh, my God, so much anxiety. Like, so much anxiety, right? So much PTSD. And this is like the Wall street cheat sheet, right? Psychology of an altcoin holder, right? Like, I mean, this is like a meme, right? I found this on Twitter.
00:33:20.170 - 00:33:34.726, Speaker A: I thought it was kind of funny, but it's like, hey, like, whether price goes up or down, you just feel anxious. It's like, oh, my God, like, it goes up. It's like, oh, it has to go down. Like, you know, so much unrealized p. Now it goes down. I'm like, oh, my God. Like, why am I holding this shitcoin? Like, I don't even believe in this stuff.
00:33:34.726 - 00:33:54.246, Speaker A: It's like, oh my God. So, yeah, I mean, I feel like people only feel this if they like buy altcoins that they don't really believe in. So I generally, you know, suggest people to buy things that they believe in. So like it goes up and down. Like you don't care, right. You just like write it into next bull market. But you know, you kind of see this behavior across all the markets.
00:33:54.246 - 00:34:13.770, Speaker A: For example, Butterfly, which I'll talk about, they released their white paper, right? It pumped like 20% and then people sold them to it. Right, right. This general salt and use mindset across the markets. But you know, like I mentioned in the screenshot earlier, like LSD's have been doing really well. So let's talk about this sector. I've talked, I've shared this chart before. This is Lido ETH ratio.
00:34:13.770 - 00:34:43.780, Speaker A: And Lido tends to pump really hard against ETH and then slowly enters a distribution phase, maybe because of all the VC's and the seed investors. I'm not like a huge believer of this ratio. It's just something to be aware of. Lido is up a lot on the day, including rocket pool FXS. So, you know, just something to be aware of. And I guess, like the mindset is okay, like, I think LSD is like, LSD finance surely will be like a good sector, right? A good narrative. But is it better to allocate into the newer project or like the older, older guard, which is like, you know, lido, et cetera.
00:34:43.780 - 00:35:23.912, Speaker A: For example, there's Dinero, right? With the redacted cartel, the butterfly token. They recently released this white paper or this light paper that introduced this new decentralized coin backed by Ethereum block space. And I guess the TLDR is that, you know, it's going to be an overclouded stablecoin backed by ether and PXE, which is like the state version of ETH. And then it's going to come after Shanghai. So, you know, they don't have to incentivize that much liquidity. And then Daenerys, which is a stable coin, they can build out liquidity on curve using, you know, a bunch of CBX that they have in their treasury so they can kind of copy like the Frax eat playbook, right? Because Frax literally used the CVX in their treasury to bootstrap the growth of their fax eat. And then maybe.
00:35:23.912 - 00:36:05.228, Speaker A: And then redacted is going to create a public impermissionless RPC called the redacted relayer, which is going to allow users to use the narrow for gas and for mev resistant transactions. Lots of fluff, lots of. I mean the product isn't out yet, so maybe you can argue that, hey, like just buy into the things that's already live, but maybe this is something that could get interesting. It's a pretty low market cap, I guess. Um, I'm not gonna read through this, but you know, I've been trying to build out an intern team, right? Um, and I know like they helped me research things. Um, and yeah, feel free to pause this for like the bull and like the bear case and like the supply dynamics. But hey, you know, like maybe it's interesting, right? Maybe it's a good play on the decentralized coin.
00:36:05.228 - 00:36:38.196, Speaker A: Narrative, deadlifting narrative, Zika sync narrative, bear chain narrative, low market. Yeah, like, you know, you get, you get the whole gist of. There's another thing called like unsheath, like us, this, like, I mean, I've known about this. I never bought into it because I was like, like, what's the point of this? I don't really think there's, there like this needs to exist. They're trying to build out this index of LSD's where, you know, unsheathed. Right. It was like this basket of LSD's and they're trying to decentralize the validator stack because right now Lido has the majority market share that's not fully destined centralized.
00:36:38.196 - 00:37:16.246, Speaker A: Like let's, let's create this basket, let's incentivize things like REIT and Frac seed so that like less capital flows into stake deed, which I mean I get, but like is there really demand to buy into stuff like this? Like maybe, like maybe I have no idea. But I mean price is going up only and maybe, you know, like it's like these newer projects that's building on top of the existing protocols that will benefit the most over things like Lido. Like, you know, like holding Lido, holding FXs, rpl. Just do it. Like, I mean it's a good sector. Like if you buy it now, it's probably a higher prices twelve months from now. So you know, just something to consider.
00:37:16.246 - 00:37:52.818, Speaker A: But just looking for a newer project because maybe if you think about like the percent growth, of course, like if you're starting from zero, like the percent growth is going to be much higher, like much faster than, you know, like whatever light it was at. Now the next altcoins that's been doing well is Pendle and flash stake and kind of goes around trading yield and by the way, I don't own any of these tokens. Like butterfly, I do not own unsheet, I do not own Pendle, flash take, I do not own. I'm just, like, making these videos just so that, you know, you are aware of what's happening. And then Pendle, right, TvL is up only. Flash stake tv all up only. I mean, that's.
00:37:52.818 - 00:38:48.010, Speaker A: It's only 3 million. But, you know, Pendle has been one of the bigger benefits from the LSD narrative. And not gonna lie, like, I remember, like, back in 2021, I played some poker session at a casino. I was driving back, listening to podcasts, listening to, like, a Pendle podcast, and I was like, yeah, like, like, what the hell is this? Like, you know, this. I legit thought that this would go up to zero, but hey, like, you know, they kept building, they survived, they found prkfit, and ultimately, like, this token is up like ten x from the bottom. But, like, isn't this the type of stuff that you want to find in a bear market, right? It's like the teams that got dumped on for like two years that kept building and then priced her up after finding pop market fit, right? It's like, if this project is going to be around in two years, like, I'm sure that price will be, like, up here, right? Like, you know, so it's hard to buy into things that's already pumped a lot. But sometimes, like, that's maybe like the best thing you can do because there's a reason things are pumping because people are using it.
00:38:48.010 - 00:39:13.792, Speaker A: In Pendle and flash, they create a marketplace for yield tokens, allowing people to get a yield upfront and to speculate on the price of yield tokens. For example, you can lock up 100 stake teeth and get like five eth today. I mean, it depends on, like, what the market is pricing it in it, but it's like the basic idea. And, you know, their main gross driver on arbitram is the GOP market. So if GOP didn't play the rate, it's like 25%. You can lock up 100k. GOP get 25k today.
00:39:13.792 - 00:39:56.010, Speaker A: And I mean, you know, if you think about DeFi and, you know, if you believe DeFi is gonna hit like a trillion dollars in TVL, like a decade from now, then surely, I mean, this type of yield trading product has to be. Has to have like some usage and primary for it, right? So from that sense, I think it's pretty, pretty cool, pretty promising. They have this VD pendle model. They have, like, this new thing. I mean they're not associated with the team, but like, you know, they're trying to accumulate these V pendletoken maybe that's interesting. I will say that no, the TVL has been going up, but some of it has been incentivized. And I feel like right now the DeFi market is incentivizing protocols with higher TVL, even if the TVL isn't really that sustainable.
00:39:56.010 - 00:40:41.992, Speaker A: But I guess from a fundamental perspective, that's how tokens should be valued. Maybe, but there's some reservations, I guess. And like the yield here, right? You know, you have to lock up ve pendle to get like the Max yield. You know, you're going to get like most likely get like the lower yield and most of it is being paid on penal token. So I guess there's like some concerns about sustainability, but like if you think about like any project out there with less than $100 million market cap, like, they're not going to have everything figured out, right? Because if they have everything figured out, they're going to be like a multi billion dollar protocol. And I guess our goal is to find these things trying to build, trying to find product market fit. And yes, like the model might not be perfect, the option might not be perfect, metrics might not be perfect, ui, ux, yadda yadda.
00:40:41.992 - 00:41:19.678, Speaker A: But I guess we're more investing into the future of Defi NFTs crypto and I think it's really, really promising, to be honest. I guess the concern is it's mainly driven by emissions. I understand how it works, but it's still pretty hard to use a platform. I got onto a phone call with the team for both Pendle and flash stake. They explained it to me, but, you know, I still have a hard time grasping how it actually works. And like, how do you actually use it for, like, I guess like for profit driven motives and whatnot. But I guess, like, you know, as lsds gain more adoption, naturally there's going to be more and more demand to, I guess, get people get their yield upfront.
00:41:19.678 - 00:41:51.490, Speaker A: So, you know, maybe instead of buying Lido, maybe these are the types of protocols, right? These tangential projects within LSD's that's going to benefit the most. So let's talk about arbitrary sync, like I mentioned, like, you know, arbitram tokens, all the news, right? Like whatever. There's not that many like alternative projects that excite me fundamentals wise. And I think, you know, if you look at the arch, yeah, look at this, right? If you kind of look at this arch token ecosystem. It's like most of them kind of aren't doing that well. The fundamentals aren't that exciting to me. If, if I were to be completely honest.
00:41:51.490 - 00:43:03.912, Speaker A: I do expect Arbitrum Altseason part two once arbitram grants go live and they incentivize certain protocols and whatnot. But until then, you know, the altcoins on Arbitrum Zksync, it's just trading off of hype, and it's like a very pvP. And from my experience, I think the most of the positive price action has been seen in these cross chain applications that's deployed on L2s with already, like, decent product market fit. So when it comes to, when it comes to, like, you know, like, newer projects launching on Arbitrum, like, like, most of them are cash grabs, right? It's like these devs, like, just for something, introduce the token and say they're like the premier Dex on Arbitrum, and then it goes like a $10 million market cap, and then it goes to zero. So I think there's, like, a better risk reward in buying into projects that's been around for, like, let's say, a few years that's actually like, like deploying, like, projects on these L2s and has actual users. So, full disclosure, I don't know why it's not showing this, but actually, yeah, hold up. That was a poor screenshot.
00:43:03.912 - 00:43:29.926, Speaker A: I own this token, to be honest, I'm not a huge believer in this token. So I'm gonna. When I said selling me and go away, right? It's like, I'm probably gonna sell this in May and go away. So, you know, I don't want to hype it up too much, I guess. But I do want to talk about gamma, because I do think it's interesting. I do think it has potential. And they're a uni V three automator.
00:43:29.926 - 00:43:54.060, Speaker A: I think I have it here. So, yeah, you can kind of see here. So with the uniswap V three license expiring, we're kind of seeing all these V three forks come up. And, like, most retail participants don't know how to lp, so they might want to outsource that into something like gamma, which will create these strategies for you. And you can deposit it. So this is quick swap on Polygon. You can deposit USDC ether.
00:43:54.060 - 00:44:18.606, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, USDC ether, and then earn 34% in swap fees and also the quick swap token emissions. So I think it's kind of interesting. The only reason I want to talk about this. This is more for like the comedic reasons. So, you know, I thought the license expiry is going to lead to more forks. That's going to implement a liquidity manager like gamma. I don't really have a longer term thesis because like Unib three is king.
00:44:18.606 - 00:44:41.672, Speaker A: I love unity. You know, Trader Joe is also cool and Trader Joe is not going to implement gamma. Right. They're going to create their own thing. But, you know, it's one of the things that they talk about, right. And you kind of see like this, this was it, this theme across this video. It's like, you know, these teams that's been around for quite some time now that's like, you know, actually getting adoption.
00:44:41.672 - 00:45:32.222, Speaker A: And I didn't know this at the time, but if you go to my channel and you look up visor, right, you see this video like a year ago and it's so funny because basically the Gamma team let me move my camera. The gamma team, they, they're the same team as advisor, basically, and they have like new devs and whatnot. And I made this video back when Uni P three first came out and it's so funny. So, yeah, so basically, like, they've been around for what is this, like when? Literally two years ago. And sometimes I like to look back on these videos and I'm like, yeah, like, these videos are so bad, but I guess people watch them and, yeah, so I just want to play this video because I just thought it was so funny. Let me make sure. Yeah.
00:45:32.222 - 00:45:51.710, Speaker A: Okay. What is up, guys? Taiki here with less hair. And in this video I'll be going over why I traded my visor tokens for alchemist tokens. If you like the content, please. Like and subs. I thought it was so funny. It's like, what, what type of content was I making here? It's like, because you know that when Univ three came out, I was like, oh, yeah, like these automated liquidity managers.
00:45:51.710 - 00:46:32.166, Speaker A: Like so, so good, right? So good. And, you know, like, I have more hair here, right? And I have less here now. So like, maybe that's like a bearish or whatever, basically, right? It's like some of these projects that's been around for quite some time, I legit thought they were gonna go zero, but they're around. Like, they're literally around. And I think it's better to side with those types of projects, right? Like devs that's been building for like multiple years instead of like aping into new tokens with like, anonymous devs. I think you know, in a bear market or in like this type of market environment, the people left on chain, they're like more smarter, they have higher standards for things to buy. So like I said, like I'm gonna sell this in May or before May and go away.
00:46:32.166 - 00:46:58.210, Speaker A: But I do, I do think it's interesting. I do think it's interesting the TVL is picking up, they're gonna have more partnerships. Maybe that's, maybe that's interesting. Yeah. And you know, Pendle flash take, right? They're also on arbidrum, right? They're not like a pure arbitram token, but they benefited from arbitram. And you know, same for gamma swap and sorry, same for gamma. And then there's this other thing called Unidex and this token is like up only it's pretty crazy.
00:46:58.210 - 00:47:17.464, Speaker A: I've known about this as well. I never bought into this because I didn't think the product was that good. But I guess the market doesn't really care. But also it's like a small cap. So it's like whatever right there. This unity Dex is a meta aggregator for Defi, amms and perps. So they're trying to be not only like a spot amm aggregator, but also like a perps exchange aggregator.
00:47:17.464 - 00:47:57.324, Speaker A: So you can go to new decks and then you can like lever along eth ten x, and then Unidex will find like the best price execution for you. And then maybe, you know, 80% of your trades will be routed through GMX, 10% will be routed through Quinta, 10% through, I don't know, like some other Dex somewhere. And that way you can kind of get like the best yield or the best rates and then Unidex can take some, some cut. These are my Internet. Hopefully you can see this. But it's pretty interesting because I believe. Yeah, so, yeah, so they sold a token that the team sold their tokens in November 2020 for like twenty k.
00:47:57.324 - 00:48:33.610, Speaker A: And they've been shipping like since then. And they have this interesting model where I believe I don't have it on here, but basically like the team doesn't really have like an allocation and the only way the team makes money is through like the fees. So I think 15% to 20% of the fees goes to the team. And like that's literally like their working capital. Of course the team put like in their personal wallets, probably bought their own token at some point, right, if they really believed in what they're building. So they probably have their own tokens, but there's like no direct exposure that the team has to token or, you know, they didn't give themselves tokens basically for free. So that's kind of cool.
00:48:33.610 - 00:49:08.462, Speaker A: They're already live on Zksync, so maybe this can be viewed as, like, the GMX of Zksync. And they're also trying to build out their own app chain built on the optimism stack. This app change thesis, right? It's been hyped and whatnot. There's, like, very few chains or very few applications that's actually done it. But maybe you can argue that, hey, this is, like, a pretty low valuation. Maybe you can bind to this maybe a year from now, once the Zksync token is live, maybe it's going to be worth, like half a billion or something, right? Like, you know, ultimately, you kind of have to have a longer term time rising when it comes to altcoins. I'm not in this game, like, flipping all the coins.
00:49:08.462 - 00:49:54.700, Speaker A: And I will say, like, you know, sometimes, like, I like, like, sometimes, like, you know, I think it helps sometimes, like, just buy a little bit of altcoins, like micro caps, mid caps, small caps, just to get into this mindset, because it. If you have bear market PTSD, like me, it's really hard for me to, like, just one day be like, oh, yeah, all season time and buy, like, five altcoins, right? It's. It's impossible to go from zero to 100 real quick. So what I'm started to be, like, what I've started to do is, like, I'm, like, starting to buy some altcoins, right? Like, gamma. It's like, you know, like, shorter term. It's like, okay, like, whatever. And then I buy these micro caps, and then I, like, whenever I buy these micro caps, like, they all go down, like 40%, 50%, and I really get pissed at myself.
00:49:54.700 - 00:50:34.252, Speaker A: It's like, I allocate, like, 1% of my portfolio in these micro caps. It goes down 50%, and I'm like, did I really, you know, get rid of, like, 0.5% of my portfolio because I wanted to pump this micro cap? I'm so angry at myself. But also, right, you kind of have to get in this mindset of being comfortable with the risk and get into this mindset of, okay, like, low cap, bad project, whatever, I'll buy. Yeah, I'm not gonna talk about these micro caps, but, you know, maybe it helps to, like, just slowly think about altcoins, because at some point, retail will come back, right? They just have to, or at least in my opinion. So, I mean, going back to new decks on ZkSync, right. They have a live product, TP 1.5
00:50:34.252 - 00:50:51.362, Speaker A: million you can deposit into the USDC vault, earn 34%. There's a three day lockup, I think, and there's like a .6% fee. So it's not the best product. The UI is like not that great. But hey, they actually have product and what was gonna say. Yeah, so it's really similar to like gains.
00:50:51.362 - 00:51:08.784, Speaker A: Right? So I think they use an oracle, to be honest. Like you're better off trading on GMX Gns, to be honest. But who knows? Maybe it's like a good ck sync play. Yeah. So, you know, most arbitrary sync only projects. Just not a huge fan of, right. Just on average, very low quality.
00:51:08.784 - 00:51:37.608, Speaker A: I think the higher quality lies within these teams that's been around for, let's say over a year that's been building behind the scenes. People wrote them off as dead projects like myself. But then I come back a year later, two years later, and I'm like, wow. Like, they kept building. Right? Like, this is what happens when devs build. Like, wow, like very, very, very surprised. So, yeah, I think right now, like, the market is rewarding TVL even if it's not like, like organic or even if it's like partly incentivized.
00:51:37.608 - 00:51:59.536, Speaker A: And the market is also rewarding projects that are multi chain, that's proved themselves to not be rugs. I think that's kind of like the trend that I'm noticing, which I think is reasonable. And I think, I think, I think that's kind of healthy. And ultimately. Right, it's like I talked about. Yeah, so that's the last slide. But, you know, we often think about, okay, okay, like, are we in a bear market rally, etcetera.
00:51:59.536 - 00:52:48.510, Speaker A: But no, I think this type of chart pattern is very healthy. I think. I mean, you can argue that, hey, like, you know, maybe, you know, this little pump is like what we're seeing here and we're gonna dump again. But like, you know, why are you watching my video? Like in this market, right? Like hopefully because you like crypto, you like defi, you want to figure like you want to keep in touch with all the devs, like developers, builders, whatever fundamentals. And ultimately I think, you know, this type of chart is like, what's really promising? It's like, yeah, things that went to zero basically and then recovered and, you know, most of the tokens are already out, all the non believers have sold. And, you know, we had a washout of old token holders and now you know, only, like, the strong survive, right? It's like you have to have conviction in crypto. It's like I'm not in this game to, like, trade 10% gains.
00:52:48.510 - 00:53:11.744, Speaker A: I'm in here to, like, hold coins for many months, deal with the volatility, get laughed at when it goes down, celebrate when it goes up. But I guess, like, that's kind of the game we play. So 53 minutes in, I don't know what else to talk about, I guess bitcoin up. I mean, everything's up really good. Really cool. I guess the may seasonality is something that gives me pause. But hey, you know, eat BTC.
00:53:11.744 - 00:53:36.342, Speaker A: Like, I remain a bull. And if you wanted to reduce volatility in portfolio, really consider LP tokens. I think they're really good. You know, it's. Trust me, like, once, like, once you ape into LP tokens, it's hard to go back, right? It's like, you know, it's like, where is it? Where is it? Yeah, it's like I mentioned, right? It's like, you know, like. Yeah, like I. Yeah, like I said, like, some.
00:53:36.342 - 00:53:53.554, Speaker A: Some men get off on porn. I get off on, like, 23% yields on tricare. That. Right? I mean, it's the humble farmer way, I guess. I guess in terms of altcoins, right? Like, I guess, like hedging, right. I might hedge against Avax, to be honest. Like, you know, I keep saying this for Avax.
00:53:53.554 - 00:54:32.738, Speaker A: I kind of feel bad, but I guess we're talking about financial markets, right? So you can have to separate, like, your emotions and, like, token price. But, you know, the concept is, hey, I'm going to continue to hold on to my high conviction altcoins. I'll probably, like, buy more altcoins, to be honest, in the coming weeks and months. And then if I want to protect my downside, instead of selling my altcoins, like, why not, like, short a token that I'm not really bullish on? So. Yeah, it's good, right? You just scroll down, like, most things are up, you know, most things are green, you know, I guess if you. And, you know, like, ultimately, like, I think we're all confused at this point and I want to share it. I forgot where this was.
00:54:32.738 - 00:55:04.140, Speaker A: Was it this one? No, it's not this one. Yeah, so this is. I shared a chart before in my last video, and I'll end the wrap up the video here. This is market cap, so total three is this total three? Total three is the total market cap, excluding bitcoin ether. So it's mostly stable coins and, sorry, altcoins and stable coins. And what I did here in this equation is I took total three and I subtracted the market cap of USDC and tether. So it still includes Dai and other stable coins.
00:55:04.140 - 00:55:48.740, Speaker A: But you know, mostly right there, mostly out. And then I divided that the market cap of Ethereum, and you can kind of see that the trend for altcoins against ether is mostly down. Of course, the altcoins that do really well, right, they're going to give like 1020, 30 x gains, but most of them just like get kind of wrecked against ETh. So it's just something to be aware of. And you know, that. I think that's why, you know, like, you know, like generally in a recovery year, like most people like flock to bitcoin, flock to either first safety, and then once people start to feel comfortable, then they diversify more into altcoins, into defi, into nfts. And hopefully, hopefully we start to see this trend shift away from bitcoin dominance, away from ether dominance, back to altcoin euphoria.
00:55:48.740 - 00:56:07.428, Speaker A: But that's a man can dream. A man can dream. So thank you guys for watching. See you guys later. Link to the premium discord is in the description below. And as the markets heat up, maybe I can be more spicy and talk about two altcoin, sorry, two videos a month or something, right? So look out for that. Thank you and bye.
