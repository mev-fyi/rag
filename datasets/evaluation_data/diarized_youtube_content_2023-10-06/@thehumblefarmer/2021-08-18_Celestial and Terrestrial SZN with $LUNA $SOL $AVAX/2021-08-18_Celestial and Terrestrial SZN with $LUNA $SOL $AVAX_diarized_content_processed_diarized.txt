00:00:00.480 - 00:00:29.928, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here today I like to discuss the ongoing and upcoming celestial and terrestrial season. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. So shout out to Sokka for saying this first, but hey, Luna is the moon, Solana is the sun. So it's celestial season. Well, now let's throw in avalanche, which is an avalanche, I guess. So it's sort of like a terrestrial season, right? So we got the sun, moon and earthen all coming together to just pump our bags, I guess.
00:00:29.928 - 00:00:51.592, Speaker A: And the reason I say this is obviously Luna has done really well. Solana has done really well. Like the two coins that's outperforming the market, actually reaching all time highs. And I think avalanche is the next one coming. I don't do price targets, but I do think that, you know, this is going to be bullish for the token price. And I'll explain more empirical evidence on why I think that is right. I'm not just trying to like pump things, I guess.
00:00:51.592 - 00:01:52.582, Speaker A: I guess I'm like talking bullish about things. But, you know, there's actual reason and logic behind why think avalanche will increase in value over time. And the bullish news that was announced earlier today, like I saw this when I woke up, was avalanche Rush, the 180 $80 million liquidity money incentive program in collaboration with leading DeFi Dapps Aave incurve. And if you look into the article in more detail, they allocate $20 million of the Avax tokens for AavE users, essentially saying, hey, like, if you use Aave, we'll pay you avalanche tokens for free and $7 million for curve users. And the reason this is so bullish is that there's actually precedent on what this actually means for the ecosystem and what this actually means for the token, the gas token. Right. Because if you look back and think back onto the polygon liquidity mining program with Aave, right, this is $40 million, which was more money, but this was launched April 14 and half of it, right, half of the half of the 40 million.
00:01:52.582 - 00:02:39.640, Speaker A: So $20 million was allocated from April 14 to June 14, which is three months. So you can expect similar rates as like what we experienced in Q two of 2021, which, if you remember this was super bullish for Polygon. And if you go back to the chart of Matic, right, take April 14, which was roughly here, the price was trading at roughly forty cents, and to the peak it went up to 550%. And to the current price, it's roughly 232%. Right. So there's precedence on whenever AAvE launches with huge liquidity mining programs, the gas token tends to do well. I can't say the same for the AAve token, but, you know, there's, it just means that there's more money going to, like, more money flowing into the ecosystem, which is going to be bullish for, you know, the gas token.
00:02:39.640 - 00:03:19.634, Speaker A: Right? So there's that. And looking back, like, if you remember, like back in April, like, when I first saw the Aave liquidity money program with Polygon, I was like, alright, I'm going, I'm going apeshit, right? Because I missed out on buying a smart chain. So I knew that the next thing that launches with lots of money coming in is going to just do really, really well. So three months ago, I said don't, don't sleep on quick swap. And the matic ecosystem, I'm like, all right, I'm going to form 10,000 matic. I farmed 10,000 matic and I made $18,000 in May. So, like, you know, I was mostly farming with stable coins, but I was like, just farming the hell out of these degenerate farms.
00:03:19.634 - 00:03:54.608, Speaker A: I don't think I'll do that this time around just because I'm, I guess I'm more conservative now. But, you know, it's, I do think it's going to be bullish. The avalanche ecosystem. And, you know, congrats to, congrats to the avalanche team for doing so because $180 million is a lot of money because polygon, imagine like, just like, think about like how, how much the polygon ecosystem is thriving, right? And they only allocated $100 million to, for defi adoption. But avalanche, they're like, all right, we're gonna one up you. Where is it? $180 million. That's a lot of money.
00:03:54.608 - 00:04:07.832, Speaker A: And also, like, this is launching tomorrow, right? The banke liquidity mining incentive. I'll be putting some of my funds here. But you know, when Ave launches, like, yeah, you gotta go. You gotta go. Ape ave. Yeah. And congrats to Eman.
00:04:07.832 - 00:04:23.976, Speaker A: Essentially he's saying, all right, polygon, I'm coming for your ass, right? Like, look at his eyes. Like, you do not want to fuck with him, right? Look at his hair, his jawline. Yeah. Like, he, he's, he's definitely not playing around. He's definitely gonna be crazy. Like, it's, it's gonna be wild. So, you know, I'm bullish.
00:04:23.976 - 00:04:53.840, Speaker A: Avalanche, short to midterm. Also Luna and Solana too. But I feel like those tokens have gone up so much that I don't really know. Like, I missed out on Solana. I feel like I'm okay just setting this one out. Maybe, you know, I'll probably be trolled by the comment section, but it's okay because, you know, I remember I talked about this article about like, aave exploring Solana avalanche and L2 expansion. Well, it didn't really give a timeline, but, you know, avalanche happened, right? So it actually happened to.
00:04:53.840 - 00:05:23.700, Speaker A: So this vishal, he's not trolling. So I'm sure Solana is going to come sometime soon. And I mentioned that right now, like, the Solana ecosystem has over $2 billion locked with no, like, legit money market, right? With no pure money market. And I speculate that if Aave does launch on Solana, given how much money is already in the ecosystem, and given how many vc's are in the Solana ecosystem, I think Aave will surpass like $10 billion of TVL. Right. Maybe that's too ambitious. Maybe 5 billion is like a safer bet.
00:05:23.700 - 00:05:56.390, Speaker A: But, you know, I think that's gonna be super bullish. I'm not too bullish. The Solana equals, like these tokens because like, they're like, if you, if you know anything about the Solana ecosystem, it's that like, all these projects are VC backed and there's like, I feel like there's gonna dump on my face. So, I mean, if you're farming this with dollars or farming this with like bitcoin or something, then yeah, yeah, you can like farm to accumulate or dump. But I don't think I'll ever be buying any of these tokens just because, I mean, they're just like VC bags and I don't want to be there. Exit liquidity. But, you know, you can argue that I'm coping.
00:05:56.390 - 00:06:26.272, Speaker A: Who knows? But it's pretty funny, right? I mean, celestial because sun and moon and avalanche terrestrial. Okay. I'm sure it's become like less funny the more I explain it. But in terms of bridging assets over, I know I'm going to get a lot of questions over to. I mean, I already made a video on how to bridge assets to Luna, the terra ecosystems. So check out my 43 minutes video that I posted last week for different ways to do that. For avalanche, I recommend this.
00:06:26.272 - 00:07:00.870, Speaker A: This is the main bridge on the avalanche network. It's pretty fast, it was pretty safe pretty quick, and it's backed by the avalanche team, so I'm sure it's a safest option. I'm sure there are other bridges, but, you know, I do that, like, whenever I bridge, I just use like, the main bridge, right? Just because I don't want to like, worry about getting wrecked or something. But like I mentioned in my live stream, I'm gonna be putting all of my chain link into avalanche, right? And, you know, it took $4 to bridge from ethereum to avalanche. And I don't know how it's so cheap. But, you know, $4, it took five minutes, you know, that's pretty good. Yeah, it's.
00:07:00.870 - 00:07:24.764, Speaker A: That's the UI there. If you want to bridge assets to Solana, I'm not that expert. So maybe you can Google or YouTube elsewhere. But if I do have. If I do move funds to Solana, I'm going to be using FTX because I believe withdrawals from FTX to Solana are free. So that's pretty nice. Obviously, FTX is backed by SPF, who's also a huge backer of Solana.
00:07:24.764 - 00:08:00.188, Speaker A: So I'm sure, like, that's going to help. But, you know, looking at the coinmarketcap and I remember, like, this time last year, I was looking at the top ten, top 20 and I'm like, what the fuck are these tokens doing, right? But I'm glad to see that Tera has flipped litecoin, stellar, ethereum, classic, and like, ICP Tron, all these things. I feel like back in May, like, terra was behind tron, I'm like, what is going on? Solana, obviously number ten, doing really, really well. I pretty bullish Solana ecosystem. Short term, medium and long term. I just don't own any. And avalanche is all the way down here at number 33.
00:08:00.188 - 00:08:38.900, Speaker A: So I do think it has room to run. Not financial advice, of course, but, you know, if you. History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. And if you think about the run up to the matic token and the insane bubble it entered, I'm sure Luna, Solana, avalanche is gonna all enter bubbles. I can't predict the top, but, you know, there's gonna be some euphoria, like, around all these ecosystems. And, you know, although I don't want my bags to crash, you have to expect the crash coming, right? Because over time, more and more money will flow into these ecosystems. Everyone will be, you know, like, everyone will be giving like, ridiculous price targets and that's gonna mark the top.
00:08:38.900 - 00:09:02.314, Speaker A: So, you know, as my, like, my plan always is to just farm and dump over time. Just be humble. The stack gains, you know, I don't need a ten x, I'll just keep stacking two x, three xs. And you know, if you're in crypto for a long enough time period, then, like, we're all gonna make it, right? So thank you guys for watching. Super excited. I just woke up. So sorry if I sound a little weird, but I literally woke up.
00:09:02.314 - 00:09:23.990, Speaker A: Open Twitter, saw the news, I'm like, alright, I may be in it. Oh, sorry. One last thing is there's actually liquidity on quickswap on Polygon for buying Solana. And these rates are actually pretty good. Like, if you want to farm solmatic, you can earn 124%. The deposit is like less than 2 million. So you're going to incur lots of slippage depending on how much money you're moving.
00:09:23.990 - 00:09:50.010, Speaker A: But you know, there's actual liquidity there and actual avalanche too. There's even less liquidity and lower rewards. But you know, there's liquidity on Polygon if you want to speculate on the price of these tokens. But like I said, always do your research. Use me as a data source. But, you know, don't, don't ape into whatever I'm doing because I'm just a retail investor just spending way too much time on crypto. So thank you guys for watching.
00:09:50.010 - 00:09:58.890, Speaker A: Have a nice day and have fun farming out there. And let me know how excited you are about Luna, Solana and avalanche, celestial and terrestrial season. Thank you.
