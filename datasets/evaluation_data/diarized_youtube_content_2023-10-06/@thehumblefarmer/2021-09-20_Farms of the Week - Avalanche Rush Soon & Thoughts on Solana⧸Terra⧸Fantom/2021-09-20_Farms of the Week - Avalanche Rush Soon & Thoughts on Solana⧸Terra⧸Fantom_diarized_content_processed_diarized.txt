00:00:00.280 - 00:00:15.974, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tsaiki here. And welcome to farms of the week, where I'll be going over the farms I'm currently in as well as the farms I'm watching. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Alright, so it's a red day, right? You know, let's, let's, let's call it what it is. You know, I'm in pain. You're in pain.
00:00:15.974 - 00:01:02.116, Speaker A: You know, we're all in pain, right? At least we have that going for us. You know, we're all, we're all in this pain together. You know, chances are there's gonna be thousands of people watching this video and you can know that, you know, everyone else that's watching it is know has the same mentality, right? And the question is, the question is like, are you scared? Are you selling yada, yada, yada? And you know, the simplest answer is like, no, I'm not selling and I'm not really scared. Right? I mean, this is just a pullback, right? I mean, if you've been in crypto for a long time, it's like, I mean, yeah, it's down 15%. Like, cool, what's up? You know, it's like, who cares? And the reason I feel that way is because for me personally, like my system, at least in crypto it's pretty simple. I do the, I do the damn research. I build a conviction, I build a thesis, I deploy capital and I wait for the thesis to play out, right? And right now I've already deployed my capital and I'm waiting for my thesis to play out.
00:01:02.116 - 00:02:03.726, Speaker A: In fact, I mean, it's already played out. However, I still think it has more room to run. And I can go over, like, why that is. But before I get into that, I just want to kind of go over like the mentality that people should, I guess, think about when approaching the crypto markets. Because I think days like this is a good time for you to self reflect on whatever tokens that you're holding, right? Do you actually have conviction on these assets? And like, what is the reason you're holding them in the first place? A good mental model to think about this is hypothetically, let's say you're bag holding some random altcoin, right? You're down on your entry and let's say you have $1,000 in it, right? The question you should ask yourself is, you know, you have a $1,000 in there, so hypothetically, if you took out that $1,000, right, and you had a fiat, right, you had stable coins or whatever, would you redeploy that $1,000 back into that coin? Right. Because if the answer is no, like, why the hell are you holding the toy? Right. Why are you holding onto it? Right? You just said that, you know, if you had $1,000, you would not buy that coin, but you have a $1,000 in that coin.
00:02:03.726 - 00:02:25.022, Speaker A: It's like, you know, I mean, psychology is, like, a hell of a thing, right? So, like, obviously, like, when you buy something and it goes down, you. You kind of want to, like, hold onto it, but, you know, like, that kind of mental model might help you in reassessing opportunity cost and getting, like, through, like, all the emotions that you as a person go through, right. We all go through it. Right. We all bag holdings. It's whatever. But, you know, it's.
00:02:25.022 - 00:02:42.808, Speaker A: It's not good to keep bag holding things. It's. It's okay. Right. It's a mistake. But, you know, if you learn from it, then, you know, you're just gonna do much better in crypto. Okay, little lecture there, but let's just go over, like, why I think avalanche, at least the cycle for avalanche, is not over, right.
00:02:42.808 - 00:03:07.812, Speaker A: Because let's be real. We are no longer early in avalanche, right? Early in avalanche was when I started covering it mid August, and we were accumulating it back, like most of August. But now that it essentially peaked at $75, that's essentially when I was at work. Anyways, we are no longer early. I don't think we're late, but we are not early. Despite what other influencers might tell you, at least in my opinion, not financial advice. I could be wrong.
00:03:07.812 - 00:03:23.636, Speaker A: So the TVL on Avalanche, when I first started covering it, was under $200 million. And I said that when AAve launches, it's going to get to 10 billion. Right. That was a pretty bold call. And so far, I think it's playing out. I mean, this was 4 billion before the market dumped. Right.
00:03:23.636 - 00:03:44.782, Speaker A: Because TVL is based off of, like, bitcoin, eth, avalanche, etcetera. So obviously, when the price goes down, you know, TvL goes down. Right. Crypto is very, very reflexive in that sense. And I get a lot of questions, like, why is this figure different from defi llama? Well, defi llama, I don't think they update as frequently as marker. Right? It's a marker IO. You can see the website here.
00:03:44.782 - 00:04:06.896, Speaker A: So marker has bank key at 1.9 billion. And they also have v, which is another money market at 300 million, whereas DeFi Loma does not have that. So I think marker is a better way to track TVL. So, you know, just another tool for you to look into. However, the biggest alpha that I can share with you, that I've already shared with you is bridging data. Okay? I think this is the number one thing.
00:04:06.896 - 00:04:59.356, Speaker A: This is the most important data that you should look at if you're considering, like, entering, leaving, selling, buying. Like, anything about avalanche, right? Because the idea is that if there are more people bridging into avalanche than there are bridging out of avalanche, then, like, the ecosystem should do well, right? I mean, it's. It's like, not like, it's not rocket science, right? I get a lot of requests for Ta. I have people sending me like ta. But Ta doesn't really matter, at least in this phase of the cycle, because what matters is how much people are bridging, right? Because if my thesis is that avalanche is gonna hit 10 billion TVL, then I need to track that thesis, right? Because that's my thesis, right? My thesis for avalanche isn't because, you know, it's a Fibonacci replacement retracement or whatever, right? It's not based on TA. It's based on fundamentals. So I'm more worried about the fundamentals than I am about Ta, if that makes sense.
00:04:59.356 - 00:05:41.846, Speaker A: And I think this is the best way to track fundamentals. I mean, fundamentally, they've been super strong, right? So it's like, since September 8, if you don't count today, we've only had one red day on the 9th, right? And every day else, or every other day, it was essentially green. Today is red, obviously, because it's a red day. And I speculate that, you know, people have to, you know, I guess, bridge some funds back to the Ethereum mainnet to pay back some of their loans on, like, you know, eth layer one, Aave maker, makerdao, etcetera, right? So, you know, if. If the markets weren't red, I suspect this would be green too. But, you know, like, this is this one. It's just one red day, right? If we had, like, three consecutive red days, then I would start to be scared, right? Because then my thesis starts to get wrong, right? So that's my system.
00:05:41.846 - 00:06:32.914, Speaker A: Build a thesis, track the thesis and see it play out. And also, like, the one of the reasons another question I get is, like, you know, is avalanche rush going to be a selden use event right. Because, you know, there's, there's like, I mean, people love, like, people, people love saying that everything is going to be sold in use event because it makes them sound smart. I mean, I get, I get it, right? And avalanche rush is speculated to launch September 22 because, I mean, the avalanche labs team, even though they've never mentioned it explicitly, they've like, dropped all these hints about like, oh, yeah. Like, September 22 is our one year anniversary of Mainnet, you know, like eyeballs by the CEO and Aave. Just the governance proposal for Aave just got approved on the 19th, right. And generally, once these things get approved, it takes like a few days for these things to get deployed.
00:06:32.914 - 00:07:02.276, Speaker A: So, you know, three days after this, it's 22nd. So it makes sense for, you know, just happened. If it doesn't launch on the 22nd, it's gonna look pretty bad on the avalanche team because, I mean, they're not really communicating with that well and they've dropped all these hints, etcetera. And I thought the celtic news impact. I agree with Wayne Gary and sentiment here because, I mean, obviously some things in crypto is a cell to news event, right? Like, I mean, Cardano made it. I'm sorry. Cardano smart contracts launching and sell the news event.
00:07:02.276 - 00:07:21.644, Speaker A: It makes sense, right? Because it's mainly retail driven and people get excited on the way up. And then when smart contracts launch on the 12th, nothing happens. Right? There's no apps. You can't use it. So people kind of lose self esteem over that. I don't mean to bash on Cardano. I'm just using it as an example.
00:07:21.644 - 00:07:44.990, Speaker A: And I'm probably going to deploy capital into Cardano at some point in the future. But anyways, that is different from what's happening with Avalanche Rush because what is avalanche rush? Avalanche rush is when avalapse. Right? I guess the Avalanche foundation is going to throw money into the ecosystem. Like, okay, please, like Taiki, like, use our ecosystem. Use our blockchain. I'll give you money. Just, I'll throw you money.
00:07:44.990 - 00:08:14.646, Speaker A: Please, please use it. Right? And they're essentially doing that to everyone. So that's essentially like, why people, I mean, that's why I've been, like, front running this, right? I mean, I suspected that we'll hit $10 million, so let's just, like, front run the opportunity. And I don't. It's hard for me to think that, you know, aave launching, right? And probably locking in at least 5 billion TVL as well as, you know, all these other protocols like Kyber coming in with avalanche rush, it's gonna bring in liquidity. It's gonna make the ecosystem more legit. So if you can hear my dog.
00:08:14.646 - 00:08:36.930, Speaker A: But I really find it hard for this to be a Salton use event. My opinion, though. So that being said, let's just go over some forms, like Kyber. So Kyber launched on Avalanche. They have two pools, USDC, a stablecoin pool, and an ETH apex pool. It's actually not that good if you compare to Trader Joe. So I'm not a huge fan of this.
00:08:36.930 - 00:08:54.270, Speaker A: Also, Kyber on Polygon, it was a pretty botched. I mean, it wasn't a botched launch, but it wasn't like a good launch. They also have a lockup on your rewards. So me personally, I'm not interested. Another farm that, you know, I think I always talk about this. This is like, what I mean, right? I have all my assets. Point on Benki.
00:08:54.270 - 00:09:14.092, Speaker A: It's overlooked, it's underlooked. It's not as exciting. As for writing liquidity, you know, like, these yields aren't double digits. However, you know, I'm. I've mainly more. I've mainly been in capital appreciation mode just because, you know, like, I think this is the phase where, you know, things just trend up. And when Aave launches, like, that's when I'll be transitioning to more of, like, a farmer.
00:09:14.092 - 00:09:34.030, Speaker A: At least that's how I speculate. But it's. I think it's overlooked because right now I have my Avax bitcoin eth here, earning yield. And you can be paid to borrow, which is a concept that's kind of crazy. So, for example, let's just focus on USDC. If you borrow USDC, you pay 6% to Benki as interest rate. However, they'll pay you 10.6%
00:09:34.030 - 00:09:58.092, Speaker A: in rewards because you're using the protocol. This is avalanche rush. For now, I'm just using this. But when Aavey launches, I'm probably going to transition my funds there because I trust aave way more than Benki. Not because I don't trust Benki, but because I trust abhi a lot. Alright, so now let's dive into the terra ecosystem as well as Solana Phantom polygon. Yeah, and Solana Phantom polygon.
00:09:58.092 - 00:10:21.090, Speaker A: So not much has changed outside of price going down a little bit. My setup has not changed, to be honest, outside of, you know, I kind of pivoted my mirror long form into the Apollo form. Right. So Apollo is an auto compounder that I'll go into later. However, I will say that you know, like, I did take profits on my mirror tokens. As most of you know, I'm not too bullish to mirror token. I think it's a farm token.
00:10:21.090 - 00:11:03.332, Speaker A: That's that I'm going to personally use as my income source, right? And so far I've earned almost $700, just like farming mirror and selling it, which is nice because I can take this and put it back into anchor earn and, like, be paid 19.5% or something, right? So, you know, I had funds on anchor. I had to pay back some of my borrowed amount because, you know, my liquidation price was like $19, like early in the morning. And as I didn't want to deal with it, right, I'm just going to lower it to $14. All my borrowed funds, essentially, or not all, but most of it are in here earning 90.6%. So, you know, I can easily, whenever I want, wish you all some, and then pay back. Let's go over to Apollo.
00:11:03.332 - 00:11:25.826, Speaker A: So, you know, I, like I mentioned, I'm not too bullish on mirror token. So if there was an auto compounder, I would love to use them, right. Because what an auto compounder does is it would harvest your mirror rewards, split it up 50 50 and redeposit. Redeposit it back into the LP position. And yes, there. There is spectrum protocol that, you know, people like. However, like, I don't fully trust it because it's a lot.
00:11:25.826 - 00:11:52.314, Speaker A: It's unaudited and the team is anonymous. However, with Apollo, it's also an auto compounder, but they have backing from Pantera, right. A really big VC and do Kwon. So if Dou Kwan is putting his name behind it, then I feel comfortable as well as, like, a bunch of other VC's, right? So, you know, it's. So as you can see, my galaxy position is here earning 33%. You can see this for most other mirror. Mirror positions.
00:11:52.314 - 00:12:06.548, Speaker A: If you want to, like, know, like, how to do this, check out. Check out Danku R's video. Let me just give him a shout out here. Danku. Really good channel. He has a video on Apollo. I can't find it right here.
00:12:06.548 - 00:12:29.790, Speaker A: So check out his video if you want to know how this works, because it's kind of confusing. You have to unstake from mirror, put it back into terra swap, and then redeposit it, right. It's really confusing. So check out his video if you're confused. Okay. And they, right now, they have this community farming event, which is, you know, it's a pretty cool way to distribute tokens. So phase one lasts like three days because everyone aped in, right? This, the TVL was like 200 million.
00:12:29.790 - 00:13:03.338, Speaker A: And phase two has started. In phase one, I collected 42 Apollo tokens. Phase two have nine tokens. Essentially what's happening is instead of like, instead of like the mirror rewards being redeposited back into your lp position, your rewards are essentially being sold to buy Apollo at a price of 25. Sense. So this is a way for the Apollo team to build up their treasury and also distribute tokens to the community, to anyone that wants it. And I like these community farming events because it makes me feel involved.
00:13:03.338 - 00:13:40.754, Speaker A: It makes me feel like, you know, I'm not like being dumped on by the VC's and whatever. So, you know, it's something that you should consider and that's what I'm doing on the terra ecosystem. Okay, so let's talk about Solana. Because when I made my video with Chris, Chris McCann about the Solana ecosystem, I liked it. And I was going to bridge over, however this was, I mean, a few days after there was a, there was like a 17 hours outage, right? I mean, I'm still bullish, Solana, in the long term, but in the short term, this is not bullish, right? I'm not bearish, Solana, but this is not bullish, right, in the short term. So I have no interest bridging the Solana right now. And also, like, after this happened, people became more bearish.
00:13:40.754 - 00:14:08.780, Speaker A: So the AP wise went down, right? And these AP wise are super reflexive because on the way up, everyone's super excited because AP wise are high. People are buying the farm token, but on the way down, people lose money. People like farm and dump. And then the APYs go down because all the interest is being paid out in the farm token, right? So, I mean, it's, it happens everywhere. It happens all the time. You know, it's. History repeats everywhere, right? So not interested in slot right now.
00:14:08.780 - 00:14:43.574, Speaker A: In terms of phantom right now. My strategy hasn't changed. Right now, I'm still lending out my eth on Taro on this poll spooky phantom eth. This is a leveraged geo farming protocol, meaning that you can take your liquid, you can take your LLP position, use it as collateral, borrow more money against it and put it back. And just like two to three x leverage your farm position, right. I'm not interested in doing that because that's risky. And I, I don't think this is like unaudited people think it's safe, but, you know, I'm still, you know, kind of cautiously optimistic.
00:14:43.574 - 00:15:24.650, Speaker A: So always your own research, right? I don't fully trust this, but, you know, I'm still, I'm just farming on here for the culture, so, you know, I can report back my findings to my community, but what I'm doing is like, I'm not gonna leverage yield farm, but, you know, if these, if these djens and if all these apes want to leverage yield farm, I'm happily being the, being the lender of ETH, right, because they want to borrow ETh to leverage leverage yield farm. So I'm just gonna be there, I guess, be their lender for ETh. And I'm earning 27% at this moment. So it's pretty nice. And, you know, it's scrolling up and down. On Fantom, you can earn, like, on phantom, you can only like 37% here. On USDC, you can earn 58% here.
00:15:24.650 - 00:15:53.614, Speaker A: Keep in mind, this is risky, right? I mean, the reason these rates are so high is because they're risky, right? If these rates were safe, then everyone would pile in. So, always doing research. Yeah. I don't fully trust it, but I'm just in it for the culture. In terms of other phantom ecosystems, I mentioned that I was not really interested in deploying capital onto phantom because everything was overextended. Well, with the recent dump, Phantom is like down to almost a dollar. You know, these valuations are kind of getting more, more interesting.
00:15:53.614 - 00:16:32.654, Speaker A: And I've also often meant that, often mentioned that I like spooky swap because they have Phantom foundation rewards. What you can do is you can go to boo, right? You can stake your boo into xboo, which is yielding roughly 30%. Right. So you get a cut of the transaction fees that boo generates and you can take your xboo and stake it here and earn 17% paid in Phantom. So essentially what's happening here is you can take boo, which is the number one exchange on Phantom. I like betting on the number one exchanges, and then you can stake it here to earn 46%, right? Essentially. So, you know, if phantom dumps again, probably be scooping some phantom and or boo up to do this.
00:16:32.654 - 00:17:03.464, Speaker A: This is something I'm watching. Last thing I want to go over is something that's overlooked and it's always polygon and curve. So for anyone that's new to yield farming, I really encourage people to look into polygon just because it's the most mature ecosystem and it's the most cheap ecosystem, right. Because it's super, super centralized and there's nothing wrong. I mean, there's nothing wrong with that, right? I mean, it's a trade off, right? If you want. If you want decentralization, you have to pay higher fees. If you want lower fees, you have to go where it's super centralized and it's fine.
00:17:03.464 - 00:17:35.132, Speaker A: It is what it is. So the stable pool on curve isn't that great anymore, right? It's roughly like, you know, 9%, 9.5%. But I think what's really overlooked by everybody is the HR crypto pool. So this is when you provide, essentially this is a pool of three assets, stablecoins, bitcoin and ETH. So you're being exposed to impermanent loss, but you're being. But essentially, you can deposit your bitcoin or ETH or stable coins and earn roughly like 29% on this position. So let me just say, I mean, I have a video on this.
00:17:35.132 - 00:18:10.418, Speaker A: I'll provide a link to this in the description below. You know, like, what is, hi, crypto. But let's just do like a live demo, right? So let's say, you know, let's start with zero here. The pool weight is 33%, essentially, right? And what impermanent loss is, is like if an asset goes up a lot, then a pool will sell that asset to buy more of the underperforming asset, right? So it's in called impermanent loss. People find it scary, but let me just show you proof on, like, why. I think it's not that big a deal, especially when it comes to bitcoin, ETH and a stable coin pool. Right on curve.
00:18:10.418 - 00:18:24.898, Speaker A: So let's say the worst case scenario, right? Bitcoin doubles, right? Bitcoin doubles, like Kumbaya. Like everyone's like, super excited. And ETH also pumps. Eth triples, right? Like, oh, my God. Like, super bull market. Impermanent loss must be crazy. Oh, my God.
00:18:24.898 - 00:18:54.438, Speaker A: But in reality, impermanent loss is like only 9%, right? And if you're being paid 26%, like, who really cares, right? And on the downside, like, it also, like, helps you, like, bite it up, I guess. Because if you. If you deposit bitcoin and bitcoin underperforms, the pool will sell some USDC to buy more bitcoin. Right? So I'll provide a link to all this in the description below. But, you know, it's impermanent loss. I think people get too scared of it. Impermanent loss only matters.
00:18:54.438 - 00:19:26.796, Speaker A: I mean, impermanent loss is only a big deal if you're providing liquidity for a coin that's gonna go to zero, right? So, like, if you. If you lp'd for iron finance, right? Like, impermanent loss, like, was like 100, right? You lost it all. Or if you op a token that, like, goes 100 x, then impermanent loss is like, it's pretty wild. So always keep that in mind. So, yeah, I went over a bunch of ecosystems. Hope this video was useful. Where's price at now? Okay.
00:19:26.796 - 00:19:42.674, Speaker A: I mean, it's not too bad. So thank you guys for watching. Have a good day. Have fun forming out there. And, yeah, just ask yourself, like, do I have the conviction? Right? What is your thesis? What is my conviction? And then I think it'll allow you to navigate the crypto market a lot more better. All right, thank you guys for watching. Have a good one.
00:19:42.674 - 00:19:47.650, Speaker A: And check out my private discord if you wanted to know how I'm navigating markets. Thank you.
