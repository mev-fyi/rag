00:00:01.240 - 00:00:46.300, Speaker A: What is up guys? Tyke here and welcome to Farms of the Week, Harmony Edition. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so let's start out with Defi Kingdoms on Harmony, which is currently my highest conviction farm in all of crypto. And the easiest way to understand it is that this is a game with a decentralized exchange built into the game and you know, the form token which is called Juul that you can earn by being a liquidity provider going to have in game utility. So, you know, unlike other farms where people just like farm and dump the token, you know, just to, just for income and cash flow there, there is potential that, you know, the farm token could appreciate in value if this game does take off. And before I get deeper into this game, into Defi Kingdoms, I'm just going to recommend you, you know, if you have this video at 1.5
00:00:46.300 - 00:01:14.148, Speaker A: x speed or two x speed to go back to one x speed, because I'm going to unmute the website and I just want you to appreciate the music that they have, the background music. Alright. Alright. I'll stop you with the awkward silence there. But you know, I'm not gonna go over the game in too much detail. I'll just be talking about this form more from I guess the farming aspect. So I'm gonna go over the gardens to Marketplace and the bank.
00:01:14.148 - 00:01:35.558, Speaker A: Okay, so let's go over to the gardens first. And you can see that the music changed a little bit. It's just like a more calm and peaceful music. And you have, you have this guy that's picking, picking jewel from his garden. He got some bunnies running around. But if you go to the druid, right? If you go to the druid, you can essentially see, I guess, all the forms available on the platform. So let's wait for the harmony RPC to load.
00:01:35.558 - 00:02:06.548, Speaker A: But these aprs are going to be in the four digits, right, which is kind of crazy. Now, these aprs aren't real in the sense that most of your tokens are going to be locked. But I'll go over the farm tokenomics later in the video. So right now, as you can see, the TVL is 160 million, 137 million in the Dex and 28 million into the bank. And I'll go over the bank later. So most of these are pool too, meaning that, you know, it's going to incorporate the jewel token. Right now I'm currently in two pools, the jewel USDC pool and the jewel one pool.
00:02:06.548 - 00:02:30.932, Speaker A: So they're pool too. So, you know, if the game does fail and the token goes to zero, I lose all my money, right. But, you know, I'm, I'm making them make. I'm willing to take that risk because I, I really believe in this project and I think it can work out. So let's just wait for this load. But yeah, I'm in the jewel one pool and the jewel USDC pool, which is, I believe, right here, the high aprs. And if you don't want exposure to the farm token, right.
00:02:30.932 - 00:03:03.830, Speaker A: You can also be a liquid for like one buSD, one USDC, one eat bitcoin eat, et cetera. So, you know, this could be a good way to establish your bullishness through on the, on the, on the harmony tokenization, if you're interested. So, you know, I'll go over to farm tokenomics later. So let's go back to the map and go over to the marketplace. And this is where now this is a decentralized exchange. Yeah, you just go to the trader, right? Who are you? Who's like selling jewel, but you can take your one tokens or just any token and just swap it for anything, right? And this is the highest TVL form or, sorry, highest TvL dex on harm. On the harmony ecosystem.
00:03:03.830 - 00:03:37.830, Speaker A: So most swaps you should be doing through here. Lastly, I'll go over the bank. So the bank, so I guess the jewel token, it also operates on the X sushi model, where if you stake your jewel token and convert it into X jewel, you can earn part of the protocol fees. If you go to teller, you see that if you stake your jewel, you can earn one third of the generated trading fees. So this could be a way to, if you have Juul and you're bullish on it, you can stake it, etcetera. And on the gaming side, they do have random airdrops to people that hold X jewels through these NFT airdrops. Through these airdrops.
00:03:37.830 - 00:04:03.956, Speaker A: The team is essentially mitigating the sell pressure on the token. And speaking of the price of this token, it's gone up. It's been kind of up only. And if you go to the market cap, it's not like a cheap farm by any means, but if you're farming this, not third pool two, or with maybe one USDC, could be a good way. I believe in this. It's high. It's like a really high conviction form for me.
00:04:03.956 - 00:04:45.414, Speaker A: So I'm being exposed to pool two, and I'm okay taking that risk. So I have a little presentation prepared for you guys going over, like, more of the farm tokenomics. And I like where I see this, this particular project going. Let me real quick and go over to the presentation. Okay. So essentially, I guess one thing that people should realize is that, like, when it comes to decentralized exchanges on new ecosystems, sushiswap is always everywhere, right? But they're never the number one exchange. They're always like number two, number three, number four, etcetera, because they just can't compete with the aprs of like, the native Dexs, right? Because sushi is on all ecosystems, so they can't really give like, super high inflationary rewards.
00:04:45.414 - 00:05:28.248, Speaker A: But, you know, if you're a Dex on a native ecosystem, right, you can give out like higher apRs, which means you're going to lock up higher, higher TVL. So, you know, I guess, like when I entered the, the avalanche ecosystem, the one mistake I did was that I bet on Bingo Trader Joe. Obviously I'm coping and Joe did much better. So I learned from that and said that, you know what, I'm really going to identify the number one Dex and just bet on that and just like, form that token. So that's kind of what I'm doing right now. So in terms of like, the TVO recently, I think a couple days ago, Defi Kingdom has actually flipped sushi in TVL. So that thesis is playing out, and I don't really see that changing anytime soon, given where the team is going with the game as well as like, the farming apRs, which is pretty nice.
00:05:28.248 - 00:06:21.008, Speaker A: And the Defi kingdom's dominance is at 49%. So I just want to touch on like, this vertical of gamification and Defi because whether or not, you know, Defi kingdoms ends up becoming the winner, and maybe there are multiple winners, right? There's no way to predict. I think the vertical with the highest potential right now is gamification and defi because, I mean, I make farming videos. I make defi videos and like, I'm trying to, like, educate people about like, the beauties of farming and, uh, decentralized finance, but it's a complicated concept, right? Like, it took me a while to understand it, and I'm sure it took you a while to understand as well. So maybe a game can have, I guess, can reach a wider audience and it can teach a lot more people about, you know, like, why Defi makes sense. So, you know, I've spoken to multiple teams that's working on, you know, this particular vertical. My personal debt is on Defi Kingdoms but I just wanted to shout out two other projects that are working on, I guess the same concept that are working on cool things.
00:06:21.008 - 00:06:33.688, Speaker A: So the first thing is going to be Defi land. They're based on Solana. They won a hackathon a couple months ago. I believe they're well funded. And I talked to the team, I mean, they're great. I'm not farming them right now. I think they have a token.
00:06:33.688 - 00:06:57.722, Speaker A: I don't know if they're alive yet, but they're going to have a token. They're based on Solana. The second one is Project Oasis. They are on the binance marching, I believe, and they do have a token. If you're interested in gamification and Defi, maybe these two are projects that you should check out. But I'm just gonna keep talking about Defi kingdoms because that's what this video is about. And one of the reasons were like, when it clicked, like why I'm like, oh my God.
00:06:57.722 - 00:07:34.442, Speaker A: Like this game has so much potential is that they had this, this nft sale of like the Gen zero heroes. And the heroes are like the characters you used to play in the game and they literally sold out in ten minutes. And the sale value was $4.5 million, right? So everyone just wanted this game. There was so much demand, there's so much hype. I'm like, okay, like if the community just like buys just like sweeps the entire floor, I guess, of like Gen zero heroes, then I should be paying attention to this a lot more. And the cool thing is that, you know, people were able to purchase these heroes for, I believe, 1000 to 2000 jewel when the price of jewel was $1.50
00:07:34.442 - 00:07:56.204, Speaker A: or roughly $1.50. But now the price of jewel is roughly $3.70 and those heroes are being listed for over four x, the price, which is pretty, pretty insane. So if you're interested in like the game, the gaming aspect, right, I really suggest people subscribe to crypto with Tosh. He has under a thousand subscribers. Let's change that. Let's get him off with hik, let's get him higher.
00:07:56.204 - 00:08:26.862, Speaker A: And you can see that the floors of Gen Zeros are like 2.5k jewel for rare ones, four to four and a half k for legendaries, and ten k for mythical ones, which is pretty insane, right? I mean, these, these, these NFts are going for crazy amounts. And I'll go over this later. But also heroes can help you unlock some of your locked tokens, which could provide value for anyone that's farming this as well. So let me just go over to farm tokenomics. And this is a little confusing. It took me like a week to fully understand it and I like got myself confused the first time.
00:08:26.862 - 00:09:08.686, Speaker A: But hopefully with my better understanding I can explain it to you. Okay, so don't get confused. But these are, I guess in defi kingdoms there are epochs and each epoch is one week long. And you know, essentially, like with the tokenomics, the longer you wait to claim, the more tokens you can unlock, right? So if you claim right now, you unlock. Right now we're on epoch seven. So if you claim your farmed tokens, you get to unlock 17%. But if you wait till next week to claim, then you can unlock 19%, right? So it's kind of like ponsonomics where people are incentivized to not claim, and if people aren't claiming, then they're not selling it, right? So it's kind of maintaining the price of the jewel token.
00:09:08.686 - 00:09:43.852, Speaker A: So let me just give over. Let me just show you an example of how this actually works. So we're in epoch seven, but you know, let's assume that we go back in time and what we're at epoch one. And let's just assume that, you know, every, every epoch, we get to farm 100 additional jewels, right? So first epoch, we have 100 tokens and then 30 pocket 300 tokens. So if I claim in epoch one, I unlock five joule, right? Because I get to unlock 5%, but the 95% is locked. If I claim any epoch two, I unlock 14 joule, right? So I didn't claim any PoC one. I waited until epoch two and now I'm in the 7% bracket.
00:09:43.852 - 00:10:12.110, Speaker A: So I get to claim 7% of 200, which is 14. And if I claim in epoch four, then I get to claim 11% of whatever I farmed. So that's 44 joule. So essentially the longer you wait, the more you get to unlock. Obviously, if you claim your tokens early and lock more, you can still stake it in the bank for extra and earn protocol fees. And I believe like whatever fees that the game makes through, like actual, the actual game extra holders get. Get some of those fees as well, which is pretty interesting.
00:10:12.110 - 00:11:08.866, Speaker A: So once, once you claim like whatever tokens, like whatever that's locked is going to be vested until q three of 2022. And at that rate, it's going to be unlocked linearly over the next twelve months. So you know, if you're going to be claiming immediately, then you're going to have to have a really long time horizon for the game, which could be dangerous, but who knows? Like maybe that's a blessing in disguise because maybe this game takes off or something. You know, that's kind of the tokenomics of this farm and this is like a graphical representation, it's kind of obvious but like. And obviously, you know, the amount that's unlocked goes up over time and the multiplier which is like the APR, it also goes down over time. And yeah, we're on epoch seven right now and I think for me in the US a new epoch happens like every like Tuesday or something. So what I'm personally doing right now is that I'm gonna farm my jewel and just let it say I'm not gonna unlock it, I'm not, I'm not gonna claim any because I just want to have, I guess, more liquidity.
00:11:08.866 - 00:11:40.812, Speaker A: I want to be able to claim more like in the future. I have conviction in this one. So like I'm not really incentivized to sell this token immediately. I'm taking on the execution versus by the team, right. Because if I wait until like let's say like q one of next year and the game fails, then yeah, I wish I would have sold earlier but you know, there's no way for me to know and you know, I talked to the team, they're great and you know, I'm fine taking all the risk and I'm not saying this is the best strategy, right. There are people like doing other strategies, right? People are. Some other people are like claiming it, hyper compounding it, claiming it, and then staking the next jewel.
00:11:40.812 - 00:12:39.586, Speaker A: There isn't the best, there is no best strategy because it's so uncertain like how the game will play pan out. But given, you know, how fast nfts sold, given the valuation of these nfts, I think it makes sense that, you know, this game could potentially take off, you know, and maybe check out Defi land and Project Oasis too for a potential gaming play as well. And Defi kingdoms, they announced that they're looking to expand into the phantom ecosystem as well. There's going to be an AMA with Austin from FTM alerts happening tomorrow, I believe, so I'll definitely be tuning in and I'm not really sure like what their expansion plans are, but I'll wait for that. And I don't know if you can see the Twitter handle, but this is Kevin, right, the CEO of Ava Labs and he's also like trying to get like Defi kingdoms into avenge ecosystem as well. So it seems like these foundations like Ava Labs, the Phantom foundation, they see the value in Defi kingdoms. And, you know, this is a trend that, you know, you would like to see continuing if you are farming this token.
00:12:39.586 - 00:12:59.380, Speaker A: So, you know, Defi Kingdoms really like game. I'm trying to understand the game more. You know, I'm like, watching crypto with Tosh's video. So, you know, if you're interested in the gaming side as well, then, yeah, subscribe to crypto with Tosh and let's get him over a thousand subscribers. Okay, cool. So that being said, I have a few more other farms to. To discuss, so let's get into that one.
00:12:59.380 - 00:13:24.274, Speaker A: So first is Artemis. Artemis, I don't know how to pronounce it, but they're essentially a launch pad for harmony projects and game and harmony is a really new ecosystem. There aren't really like that many projects out there. But, you know, it's cool regardless. So if you go to the website, you can go to Artemis earn, and you can essentially be a liquidity fighter and earn the Artemis token. Right? So these aprs are pretty high. I don't really believe there.
00:13:24.274 - 00:13:43.650, Speaker A: I don't think there are any lockups. So there's a lot of people like farming and dumping this. If you look at the price chart, it kind of going down. This is the hourly. If you look at the daily, it's a much more grim picture. Bam. So this is what happens with most farm tokens because people just use it as an income source and there's really no incentive to hold it.
00:13:43.650 - 00:14:13.096, Speaker A: So it's interesting what Defi Kingdoms is trying to do where there's in game utility for the token, which if it works out, then that's great. If not, then it just becomes, it's going to look like this, right? If the game, if no one adopts the game. Next I want to look into tranquil finance. This is going to be a money market, right? I believe they're going to launch the 31 October. It's going to be in like two weeks. They're a fork of compound, I believe. And even though they're not live yet, you can actually go into the testnet to see what it looks like.
00:14:13.096 - 00:14:42.424, Speaker A: So let me just go to the testnet so you can see for yourself. Okay. Yeah, so it's a compound fork. And yeah, you can deposit harmony, bitcoin, eat tether, or USDC is collateral borrow against it. These numbers are not real because it's a testnet. But it's cool, right? You know, I'm a money markets guy, and you know, if this does launch and if I, like, I'm not sure like, who the team is, but, you know, they received $50,000 from the Harmony foundation, so that's a good sign. And if it's a compound of.
00:14:42.424 - 00:15:03.324, Speaker A: Sorry, if it's a fork of compound, then, you know, the smart contracts should be more battle tested. But, you know, something to look into. It's a money market. So last two or last three farms or, sorry, last two forms I'll go over is curve. Obviously, everyone loves curve. I love curve. Unfortunately, the curve rewards that they're receiving from harmony is really low.
00:15:03.324 - 00:15:34.820, Speaker A: I believe they're getting like $3 million from the Harmony foundation, which is kind of sad, but I think we're all spoiled from like, you know, like avalanche laughs and like Phantom foundation giving more tokens. But, you know, just on curve, you can earn 11.37%, which is an okay rate for stable coins. I think the more important thing is that curve is actually here. So which is going to essentially build out liquidity and I guess help establish the peg for Dai, USCC and tether. You know, it's all right. It's all right.
00:15:34.820 - 00:16:04.014, Speaker A: Lastly, I want to go over sushi. So there's been an issue with the RPC's on Sushiswap, so it doesn't load sometimes. So fortunately I have this tab open called VFAT tools. Let me just refresh the page here. So I'll provide a link in the description below. But this also shows, I guess, all the forms available on harmony. And I guess, you know, if you go to the harmony tab here, it'll essentially show all the farms available right now.
00:16:04.014 - 00:16:24.102, Speaker A: So. And I'm not gonna go over this like all of this, obviously, but it could be something that to look into. But okay, it's not loading. But you know, you get the point. You can check this whenever sushi swap is buggy with harmony, but it's all right. I believe their sushi swap also got harmony rewards. I think those got depleted because the rates that I saw like were really, really low.
00:16:24.102 - 00:16:48.982, Speaker A: But you're still getting sushi rewards, I believe. But given the buggy website, it's kind of hard to tell. Lastly, I just want to touch on the fact that aave is coming on Harmony. I don't know when I believe they're getting $5 million in one tokens, which is really low compared to like $20 million from Eva labs. But it's something, right. And the more important thing is that there's a trusted money market coming to harmony. So all.
00:16:48.982 - 00:17:09.158, Speaker A: It's like, to be honest, it's really hard to tell, like, when this is actually coming. Um, but, you know, it's coming, it's coming. So Harmony is a really new ecosystem. Uh, it's trying to get built out. Um, it does have problems with liquidity. Like, when I first switched ones over. Like, I had to pay like 1% leverage to, like, swap from like, just like regular assets like USDC and whatnot.
00:17:09.158 - 00:17:34.886, Speaker A: Uh, which is kind of a pain. But, you know, that's kind of like the pains of being or the costs of being an early adopter. So, you know, I do, I do like the technology. I do own, like, barely any harmony tokens. I'm just staking it to a validator. I do think I do want to be gaining more exposure to the harmony ecosystem. And I guess, like, my main exposure is Defi kingdoms, right? Just farming jewel and just hoping that it works out.
00:17:34.886 - 00:17:58.350, Speaker A: And if you go to the discord, I really encourage everyone to go to the discord of Defi kingdoms because that discord is popping. Yeah, everyone is super engaged. The team is doing a great job and I really encourage everyone to look at Defi Kingdom. So thank you guys watching. Have fun farming out there. And if you want to know how I'm farming in this market, please check out the private discord link is in the description below. Thank you guys for watching and have fun farming out there.
00:17:58.350 - 00:17:58.930, Speaker A: Bye.
