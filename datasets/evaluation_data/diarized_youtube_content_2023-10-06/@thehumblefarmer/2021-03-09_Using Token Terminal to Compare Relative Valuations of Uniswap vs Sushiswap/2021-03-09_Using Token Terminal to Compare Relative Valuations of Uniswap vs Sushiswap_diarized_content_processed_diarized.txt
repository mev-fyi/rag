00:00:01.040 - 00:00:22.890, Speaker A: Welcome to Quick Defi Alpha. And in this video, I'll be using token terminal to compare the relative valuations of Uniswap and sushiswap to better inform our financial decisions. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. And check out the playlist on Quick Defi Alpha. And none of this is financial advice. So let's get started. So what is token terminal? Token terminal basically allows us to compare traditional financial metrics on crypto assets.
00:00:22.890 - 00:00:44.068, Speaker A: It's currently free for all of us to use. I think it's like a free trial to acquire more customers. So I encourage everyone to check out the terminal here. And it's really cool because you can check out the revenue. So, for example, the total revenue paid in Defi cumulative is approaching a billion dollars. That's a lot of money. And you also can look at the price to sales, et cetera, for all these protocols.
00:00:44.068 - 00:01:15.430, Speaker A: So if you scroll down here, we can see which protocols are generating the most revenue. So aside from bitcoin and ethereum, we see that Uniswap has generated around $96 million in revenue in the past 30 days. And Sushi swap generated $43 million, roughly 45% of that of Uniswap. So you would think that the Sushiswap's valuation would be roughly 45% that of uni, right. Well, let's check out Coinmarketcap. So Uniswap currently has roughly a $32.5 billion valuation.
00:01:15.430 - 00:01:51.214, Speaker A: Okay, how about Sushiswap? Four and a half. Hmm. Does this mean that Sushiswap is really undervalued? Does this mean that Uniswap is really overvalued? Well, to better inform ourselves, let's look at Coinbase's valuation, which is a centralized exchange that's set to IPO relatively soon. So we see that Coinbase has roughly generated $1.14 billion in revenue in 2020, and they're going to IPO at around $100 billion. Pretty hefty valuation. So I quickly made a this chart on Google sheets took like five minutes.
00:01:51.214 - 00:02:26.722, Speaker A: So for each protocol, what's their evaluation? What's the 30 day revenue we don't have for Coinbase? What's their annualized revenue? In billions. So obviously, Coinbase, this is going to be a little underreported because 2021, their revenue must be much higher. But for the sake, it's simplicity. Let's stick to this data. And in this column, I took the valuation divided by the annualized revenue. So we can see that compared to Coinbase, uniswap is undervalued. Right? It's generating around like the same revenue annualized to Coinbase, but it only has a third of the valuation.
00:02:26.722 - 00:03:23.678, Speaker A: But more importantly, we look at Sushiswap with a valuation divided by annualized annualized revenue of 8.72, which is roughly a 10th that of Coinbase. So when I see this data, I basically think to myself, okay, if I want more exposure to Dexs or Amms, instead of buying Coinbase stock or buying Uniswap governance tokens, I'll probably buy sushiswap. And this doesn't mean that I'm bearish uni like I own more uniswap tokens than sushi, but if I'm going to add exposure, I will be using sushi instead. The cool thing about token terminal is you can also look at if you scroll up the price to sales ratio, and obviously the lower price to sales the better. And we see that keeper Dao is roughly at three, sushi swaps roughly at nine, and Uniswap's roughly 29. And there are other protocols here, right? And you know, if you see a low price to sales ratio and you've never heard of that protocol, maybe you should check it out.
00:03:23.678 - 00:03:43.668, Speaker A: Like I've never heard of token one. But if you look at the 30 day revenue, I think they were like top ten. They were right here. They were generating $6 million in the past 30 days. So I've never heard of this protocol, but maybe this means it's worth checking out. So thank you for watching.
