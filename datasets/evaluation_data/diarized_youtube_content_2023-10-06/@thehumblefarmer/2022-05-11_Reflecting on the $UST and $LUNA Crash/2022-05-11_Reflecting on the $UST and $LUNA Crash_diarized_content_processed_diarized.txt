00:00:01.320 - 00:00:52.235, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. So, you know, let's discuss everything that's happened in the last 24, 48 hours because it's been really rough, right? It's one of those. I wouldn't really call it a black swan because we always knew this was possible, right? But it's one of those tail risks that, you know, we always know that exists, but we sometimes don't account for it because, you know, it's really difficult to quantify the actual likelihood of these things happening. And. Yeah, so let's first discuss everything that happened. And you know, instead of talking about Luna ust like the future or whatever, I'm not really going to focus on that because at this point, it doesn't really matter what I think. It just kind of matters how do Kwon Terraform Labs and like its backers, right, how they're going to respond.
00:00:52.235 - 00:01:10.697, Speaker A: So I don't really have an edge in like predicting what's going to happen. So I'll just more focus on like the human elements of my channel, myself and just crypto in general. And. Yeah, let's. Yeah, let's talk about everything. So obviously I put out this tweet yesterday. You know, it's Danku, right? A fellow YouTuber.
00:01:10.697 - 00:01:52.121, Speaker A: We both covered Terra. I had him on my channel like 2 times, 2, 3 times. Overall. Good guy. And, you know, he was really feeling bummed out last night about, you know, like talking about Luna, you know, being bullish, like, it's Luna and like seeing it implode before your eyes. And, you know, I felt the same way, right? Because it's one thing for me to lose money, right, in the markets, right? That's, that's my fault. But given that I have the platform, which I'm really grateful to have, right? The fact that, you know, I have this platform and I've been bullish Luna and USD for seemingly almost the past 12 months, you know, definitely got complacent, right? And you know, it's.
00:01:52.121 - 00:02:45.383, Speaker A: It's like impossible not to feel guilt, responsibility because, you know, as my channel grows bigger, right, it's one thing when my channel has like 500 subscribers, right? I can just like talk about like, whatever, right, Like Doge to the moon, whatever. But at this given point, right, at the level that my channel is, you know, I have to have to be better. You know, it's because I feel like my sentiment when it comes to Luna and USD, which was kind of like consensus at this point, but, you know, it was still complacent where, you know, I was like, yep. Like, I think Luna, right, with the UST mechanic, with the tokenomics can outperform in like a bearish environment. We kind of saw that earlier in the year, right, where it like outperformed the rest of the market. And, you know, I was complacent in the sense that, yeah, like, I think the USD peg is fine, right? It's got a bunch of backers backing it. They accumulated some bitcoin.
00:02:45.383 - 00:03:38.725, Speaker A: But obviously, you know, when, you know, when these things get tested, depending on the magnitude of the stress, you know, we can really see, we can really see things unwind. And you know, I was gonna make a video yesterday, right, for Monday, but I was a little bit too overwhelmed with everything was going on. So I was like, okay, let's give it a day and cover it tomorrow. And I was preparing material for, you know, today's video because, like, whenever I make these videos or like, traditionally I like to format it, right? I prepare like 10 tabs and like, or like create like a slide deck. But this video is like more improv too, right? I kind of want to just have like a heart to heart, you know, because sometimes I give off this robotic nature, you know, that's what people tell me. But I do have emotions and, you know, I don't think, like, emotions are talked about enough in crypto. Right.
00:03:38.725 - 00:04:19.135, Speaker A: And anyways, yeah, it definitely sucks, right? Because yeah, like I said, it's one thing for me to lose money, but it's another thing for you know, people to, you know, buy into what I'm saying and have them lose money. It's, you know, it's, it's really tough, right? It's been pretty bad. It's. Yeah. So, you know, just for transparency reasons, right. I guess, like the amount I lost, I have to do the math, but I think I lost roughly 7 or 8% of the portfolio, plus or minus 1% on either side. 6 to 9%, I guess, but probably like 7%.
00:04:19.135 - 00:04:52.329, Speaker A: Ish. Like, fortunately, I took profits a couple weeks ago on Luna. You know, I diversified like my stablecoin risk and. But obviously, you know, like, we stake UST to earn 20% and then it depegs like 40%. Like, oh God. So, you know, I was hit on both Luna and UST Right now I'm primarily out of those markets just so I can start with a clean slate. You know, like I mentioned, I'm not going to talk about Luna and USD, but my base case, right.
00:04:52.329 - 00:05:25.755, Speaker A: Keep in mind, I have no idea what the hell is going to happen it mostly depends on how they're going to, how the team is going to react from this. But I think what's likely I could be wrong is I think UST will re peg and it's going to contract in market cap significantly. And I think Luna, the asset is going to like suffer a lot. It's going to be really difficult to bounce back from this because it's one thing for USD to de peg back in May of 2021, right? Because a similar thing happened 12 months ago. But USD was a small market cap. Right. It didn't really hit the rest of the market.
00:05:25.755 - 00:05:52.313, Speaker A: But given that USD was a top 10 asset, I think a lot more people have exposure to USD and Luna. And if that's going to be, if that's the case, then when it does, you know, blow up, it's going to affect the rest of the market. And we kind of saw that yesterday. So that's my outlook. Right. And even if UST and Luna does come back, I think it's going to take some time for the system to, you know, improve. I think they're going to have to redesign the system.
00:05:52.313 - 00:06:12.143, Speaker A: Right? Because obviously this design system, it didn't work. Right. It didn't withstand this stress test. So if they were to come back from this, then, you know, first of all they have to defend UST first. Right, Whatever. Whatever that means. And then after that they're going to have to recreate the Luna design.
00:06:12.143 - 00:06:34.665, Speaker A: I don't know what they're going to do, but I think that's going to be the best path forward for them to pivot into a different model. I don't really know how, I don't really know where that's going to go. But yeah, that's kind of how I think about it. Right. Like, I'd rather it's just like de Risk now and then buy back higher once it's proven itself. That's kind of my sentiment. So that's my sentiment.
00:06:34.665 - 00:07:37.995, Speaker A: But yeah, going back to like my, I guess, like the more personal and human side of this channel, you know, I really try to, you know, first of all, like do good research, right. And hopefully my ideas have been helpful historically, even though recently I feel like my research hasn't been that good. To be honest. You know, when I started this channel, right, back in late 2020 or early 2021, right, when my videos got like 12 views on average, I had to add my girlfriend and like my family members to like comment and stuff, right. It was, it was in those days I really came To I created this channel, started making videos in the hopes of educating people, right? Because making videos was a way for me to be like, for me to take accountability, to do good research and you know, to formulate my thoughts right in a concise way. And over time, right, my very first couple of videos I was like, hey, like I'm buying these governance tokens, right? Great thing. And then I got wrecked and then I'm like, okay, like that's not the way to go.
00:07:37.995 - 00:09:07.091, Speaker A: Let's focus more on like how money flows through ecosystems, demand, like supply demand dynamics and hopefully that's going to be a better way to invest in whatnot and you know, in like a super bullish environment, right? I think I did pretty well, right? On average. But you know, in this hyper market, you know, it's USD has imploded and you know, I think one of the things that like I really value a lot is like my ethos, you know, like I said like when I started this channel, right, it was with the intention of helping people, educating people and really being the part of the industry for a long term. I don't do cash grabs, right? Like I like, I don't run ads, I don't do paid promotions, I don't even participate in seed, seed, seed rounds, right? I get offered them but like I just like don't do them just so that like I understand like how everyone feels. I have to you know, participate in the secondary markets as does everyone else. Because I think it's a little weird when you know, influencers just get like an advantage over everyone else just because, you know, they have a following. So I'm gonna maintain that ethos, right? So yeah, I'm going to maintain that ethos and you know, like I said like this video is unscripted so like I'm kind of losing my train of thought. But I guess the point is like, you know, I try to have good intentions.
00:09:07.091 - 00:10:03.729, Speaker A: I really try my best when it comes to sharing ideas, sharing research. You know, I hope this moment is a way for everyone to understand that like, you know, I could be wrong, I'm usually wrong. You know, anyone making videos on YouTube, anyone tweeting on social media, whatever, no one's perfect. At the end of the day, no one knows how markets move. Sometimes we're caught off side, sometimes we misallocate and at the end of the day we're just trying to do our best to manage risk and have realistic expectations and definitely like when it comes to this, right, definitely didn't to the best of My abilities, but I think I know exactly how I want to rebound. You know, like I said, I'm going to be, you know, part of the space for a very long time. I'm not going to let this affect me.
00:10:03.729 - 00:10:46.219, Speaker A: In fact, you know, this gives me more. This gives me more motivation to work harder, to be better, and, yeah, just keep bringing the best content that I can create. I want to get to the point where you can doubt my ideas and my research, but you can't doubt my integrity. That's my North Star, and I hope that's been made clear in the past year and a half or so. Yeah. So bring it all back, right? You know, definitely. This is like, you know, this is gonna.
00:10:46.219 - 00:11:00.771, Speaker A: Yeah, this is, like, not good for markets. Right. It's probably gonna bring some negative headlines in terms of regulation. You know, maybe this video is the bottom. Right. Like, imagine that. But yeah, it's definitely doesn't feel great right now.
00:11:00.771 - 00:11:28.885, Speaker A: Right. And, you know, I don't want to be that. That guy saying, like, oh, you know, like, manage downside, manage risk. But I guess, like, that's kind of how I have to be now, you know? Yeah, it's. It's rough. I hope everyone's doing okay. You know, I guess what you can expect from me is that, you know, I'll keep stripping, I'll keep doing my best.
00:11:28.885 - 00:11:57.691, Speaker A: Not gonna let this stop me, you know, because, you know, this is part of the game. Right. I mean, I come from a poker background. You know, I've had more painful moments than this. And every time, you know, it's like seven steps back, eight steps forward. Right. Like, I don't know how I came up with those numbers, but, you know, that's how I've persevered my entire life and got to where I am, and I'm not gonna let this stop me.
00:11:57.691 - 00:12:18.615, Speaker A: And I hope that, you know, you guys will stick through me with the journey, and I hope everyone's doing okay. That's kind of how I feel about. Feel. Feel right now. Yeah. Not much else to say. Yeah, that's about it.
00:12:18.615 - 00:12:29.969, Speaker A: This is the. This is how it is. When I don't have a script, I just, like, blank out because English isn't my first language or whatnot. So. Yeah, it is what it is. Thank you guys for tuning in. Yeah.
00:12:29.969 - 00:12:32.745, Speaker A: And have a good one out there and see you guys later.
