00:00:00.280 - 00:00:17.166, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here. Today I'll be going over obvious health factor, what it means and how you can protect your collateral from being liquidated. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. So people have been asking like, hey, isn't your health factor pretty dangerous? I mean, it's 1.4. It's. It's an orange color.
00:00:17.166 - 00:00:54.170, Speaker A: That means it's dangerous, right? But the health factor. Well, later in the video, I'll give like a mathematical proof to show you why I'm not in any danger. But the health factor doesn't really consider what you're borrowing and what your collateral is, right? It's like taking some ratio and like calculating 1.4. The more important figure is if you click on the details tab here, it'll show you that the liquidation threshold is 77.67%. This is the most important number for your particular portfolio. And it's like roughly 78% because I'm borrowing dying WBTC. Like, if you're borrowing against, like, Ethan or like matic, for example, it might be lower.
00:00:54.170 - 00:01:32.136, Speaker A: But the liquidation threshold, the definition is the percentage at which a loan is defined as under collateralized. For example, a liquidation threshold of 80% means that if the value rises above 80% of the collateral, the loan is under collateralized and could be liquidated. So that's the most important thing. If. So, essentially this means that, hey, like, if I. My loan value, right, $17,000 that you see here reaches 77.67% of the value of my collateral, then I'm under collateral, collateralized, and I could be liquidated.
00:01:32.136 - 00:02:12.760, Speaker A: So this is a more. So let me just show you, like, a more mathematical way to look at this and what this actually means. So I took the. Made a spreadsheet, essentially took how much bitcoin I have, how much dai I have, and like, rough, roughly, my total is 30.8k, right? And the loaned amount of my USDC and dai is seventeen k, and the liquidation threshold is 77.65%, right? So essentially this means that if my collateral reaches $21,900, then by default I'm under collateralized and could be liquidated. And the mathematical way you look at this is if you know how to use excel, you just take e eight divided by e nine.
00:02:12.760 - 00:02:59.386, Speaker A: So essentially take how much you're borrowing and divide it by your liquidation threshold. And that's how you calculate your liquidation level, right? So let's just go back to my portfolio and see, like, hey, like what would have to happen for me to get to, like, $22,000, right? Because most of my collateral is in Dai, then that means that bitcoin would have to dump so hard for me to get liquidated. And it's not just like dumping. Obviously, bitcoin can go down, right? I mean, we just saw bitcoin down 50% and eth go down 60%. But it's not just like, go down. It has to happen overnight. Because if bitcoin's dumping, then I can easily be aware that it's dumping and pay off my loan, so I don't get liquidated, right? So this is my explanation.
00:02:59.386 - 00:03:44.144, Speaker A: McCarthy would have to drop roughly 30% from its current value. And if you take an account that dai, assuming that Dai will be stable, my bitcoin value must fall 65% overnight for me to get liquidated, right? And if you think about it that way, like, is that gonna happen overnight? I mean, probably not, right? I mean, unless, like, there's some crazy news, like, I don't think that's gonna happen. And obviously, like, 65%, it could dip that much, like, over a course of months. But, I mean, it has to happen overnight just because I can pay off my loan anyways. Because, you know, it's not that I don't have this money. Like, I'm just using this money to farm somewhere else, right? I'm borrowing the money to use somewhere else. And if I see that, hey, I'm at risk of being liquidated, I'll just pay it off, no issue.
00:03:44.144 - 00:04:20.242, Speaker A: So hopefully this gave you a better understanding of, like, your health factor. I mean, the health factor is lesser relevant, right? What's more relevant is your liquidation threshold. And for me, I can easily do this calculation because my loaned amount isn't going to change because it's stablecoins. But if you're borrowing, like, eth against your collateral, then I guess the math problem will become much difficult. And also it'll become. And, like, even though, like, 30% overnight is unlikely, given my structure, like, if your collateral is like, a bunch of eth and matic and like, aave and, like, volatile assets, then you. That could happen overnight.
00:04:20.242 - 00:04:38.002, Speaker A: And maybe you should increase your health factor. So, you know, you gotta think for yourself, right? You can't just blindly follow what I say. Just do the math. See if you're at risk. Ideally, you don't get liquidated because you do lose some money if you do get liquidated. So hopefully this helps you. Thank you guys for watching.
00:04:38.002 - 00:04:39.650, Speaker A: Have a nice day and be safe out there.
