00:00:01.000 - 00:00:34.320, Speaker A: What is up guys? Humble farmer taiki here. And welcome to this week's edition of Farms of the week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord. The link will be in the description below. So it definitely feels like airdrop season. And I talked about this in last week's video where teams, they're more incentivized to drop a token sooner rather than later because most tokens have a one year cliff. So if the team and investors want to cash out, then it's better to start the timer right away so, you know, they won't be holding illiquid bags when we potentially see the next bear market.
00:00:34.320 - 00:00:57.662, Speaker A: And we've seen the salani custom really well, which I'll talk about later. But I just got this. I mean, I'm recording this 12:22 p.m. this came out 12:00 p.m. where Coinbase is gonna list Siem, which is gonna be an aave fork on base chain and it's gonna be airdropped. And I read through this, unfortunately, if you look at this, 69% goes to the community. Okay, you know, Brian Armstrong.
00:00:57.662 - 00:01:35.858, Speaker A: Thank you, sir. But only in order for you to be eligible for Dadrop, you have to be an early supporter to protocol and acquire OG points and other community quests that were host on Galaxy. I definitely did not do this, but whatever, right? Like, in my experience, money market tokens like Aave Forks, they just get dumped to oblivion. No one really trusts these protocols over the long run. But I do think that's gonna be a pretty good farm and dump opportunity. We've seen a lot of tokens listed on centralized exchanges do really, really well. And it might just be a token that gets traded.
00:01:35.858 - 00:02:11.174, Speaker A: But I would expect that this token will just be dumped. And if you look at the actual application, it's literally an Aave work. I guess you can trust it because I mean, coinbase is putting its name behind it. And if they're literally just forking Aave and just changing the UI, I mean, they didn't even change the UI, then maybe this becomes an interesting farming dump opportunity. I definitely don't care about this token to buy it. If the APR is at launch ends up being like 200% APR, 300% APR for ether, then perhaps it's worth, you know, just consideration. But let's talk about the main topics.
00:02:11.174 - 00:02:44.652, Speaker A: I did want to first address the Solana ecosystem. And the Jitto airdrop was actually insane. We had people that staked one Jito soul which was like I mean, under a, they received like $10,000. And if you did this across multiple wallets, then yeah, like you can literally turn $1,000 into $100,000 and still own the underlying asset, which is Jiro Sol or the staked version a soul. I know people that did this across like ten wallets. Unfortunately, I was too lazy to do this. I don't have that much funds on Solana.
00:02:44.652 - 00:03:21.092, Speaker A: I'm still biased towards the EVM ecosystem just because I understand it really well. But I mean, this is creating other speculation for other types of airdrops. So let me just talk about the other potential farming airdrop opportunities. So marginfi is definitely one. They are probably gonna be the leading lending market, money market on Solana right now. You can receive points where you can stake Jiro Sol, MSO all these assets and get these points, and you can go to the points tab here and look, point systems. I'm kind of tired of all these point systems.
00:03:21.092 - 00:04:13.042, Speaker A: It definitely makes sense from a developer perspective, why giveaway tokens when you can just give away fake points? Of course, these points will eventually be converted into tokens. But like I mentioned earlier, I think Jirasoul was a really good airdrop just because, you know, liquid staking derivatives, and they also have tangential narrative around flashbots, around like MeV and whatnot. But like, money market tokens typically just get dumped on the Jitto airdrop was only good just because no one farmed it. So there was a limited amount of tokens that got distributed to a very small amount of people. But I can definitely see in the future, more and more people deposit money in the margin, five, which might dilute the potential for these airdrops. And if you add the fact that money market tokens aren't going to be worth that much on average, then maybe most of the solid airdrop opportunities have mostly passed. There's also Kamino, which is another money market.
00:04:13.042 - 00:04:35.216, Speaker A: I think they allow lp tokens as collateral, which is kind of cool. I talked to the team. The dev started Hubble finance, which was kind of like a meager dao fork. I mean, back in 2020, whatnot. But I think they're focusing their time on this. You know, it could be worth, right? If you own soul, you might as well like just lend it out, maybe borrow some USDC, enter some farms. You can like loop it elsewhere.
00:04:35.216 - 00:05:13.952, Speaker A: But I think it's pretty cool. But I think, you know, probably the only airdrop farm that I think is probably worth your time on Solana ecosystem. I'm not saying that margin fight at Camino is not going to be worth it, but if you like, I really doubt that it's going to be the size of the Jito airdrop. I think it's very, very unlikely. I think the one airdrop that has a lot of penetration tensor, which is a blur fork, essentially, on Solana, they took away a lot of market share away from Magic Eden, and Magic Eden raised at like a billion dollar valuation. But all those VC's are probably just really, really sad, and they're probably trying to invest into tensor right now. We've seen NFT prices for the Solana ecosystem do really well.
00:05:13.952 - 00:05:52.014, Speaker A: For example, matlads. I think this is going to be the blue chip on the Solana ecosystem. I run HVA research, who, we wrote about this back in August, NFTs on Solana. When we posted this, it was like, what are you doing techie? Why are you talking about Solana NFTs? But August 7, this thing was at 60 to 70 sol, and now it's basically at 200 sol. So you three x, your Solstack and Solana also basically like four or five x. In the meantime. Do I own any? No, but I think that if you want to farm tensor, you probably should be bidding the Bluetooth nfts.
00:05:52.014 - 00:06:30.924, Speaker A: And I think mad lads is one of it. They're trying to build an exchange called backpack, and they also have, or they also innovated with this thing called xnfts, which are executable nfts, which, I mean, I don't really know what the actual value prop of that is yet, but who knows? Maybe it's worth considering. And I'll provide a link to the description for this research report, if you are ever so interested. But let's talk about the main topic. And I think this is kind of interesting because I don't really think people are talking about this, and I haven't started doing this, but I definitely will by end of year. And it's around Celestia. So, Celestia, if you look at the token, I mean, it's been parabolic.
00:06:30.924 - 00:07:03.544, Speaker A: It launched at roughly $2 in November, and now it's at $10, a literal five x on a pretty large coin. And today, like markets, I mean, it's down, but Celestia is up. You can see like this big wick here. I mean, Celestia is pretty crazy. I definitely wish I owned some. I definitely wish I started this airdrop farming operation, which I'll talk about, but going back to this, no sleep. John, I think is a pretty interesting account when it comes to the, I guess, the modular ecosystem.
00:07:03.544 - 00:07:41.948, Speaker A: He works for Hyperlane, which I think is building on top of celestia. So I guess it's in his interest to, you know, create Celestia hype. But, you know, he's been talking about this idea of a Tia airdrop season. There's, like, only a few people talking about this. And if you think about, like, really large airdrops, if everyone's farming in airdrop, it's very unlikely that that airdrop is going to be worth that much. A few exceptions for things like arbitrum and whatnot, right? Like, if you formed arbitrum, you know, you could have made a bunch of money, right? Like, I definitely, like, benefited a lot from it. But I think, you know, I mean, I guess by making this video, it's going to kind of dilute this idea.
00:07:41.948 - 00:08:05.914, Speaker A: But, hey, you know, I'm a humble farmer. We all look for humble opportunities. And let's talk about this idea. So if you remember back in last bull market, there was this idea that if you. Where is it? If you. If you stick atom, you're going to get a bunch of airdrops, right? And Atom is an asset that has very little value, or at least right now. There's a lot of drama when it comes to governance.
00:08:05.914 - 00:08:58.203, Speaker A: The community, it's, you know, it's, it's a pretty hard asset to own right now, and it is down from its all time high, which is like roughly $45. But if you take into account all the airdrops you could have received in the last bull market, I'm pretty sure that all atom stakers, I mean, if you got in early enough, are up. Obviously, if you staked the picotop, then it's very unlikely. But in the last bull market, if you stick to Atom, you see all these airdrops, like osmosis, Juno, and, I mean, this is only a little bit. There are other airdrops, like stride archway. I mean, there's, like, a lot of other airdrops, right? But basically, if you just staked Atom and held onto it, it could just receive free tokens. And for tokens like Juno, of course, Juno is in the dumpsters right now, like, under $0.50.
00:08:58.203 - 00:09:39.766, Speaker A: But if you imagine, right, like, you just hold Adam, stake Atom, Adam is going up. You get the Juno airdrop, and it immediately, like five xs from like nine dollars to forty five dollars. Um, it's crazy how it's like, at like $0.47 right now, but that's besides the point, anyone that staked Adam and remained, like, high conviction in Adam and started, I guess, creating like 1020, 30, 40, 50 different wallets that held like 15 2030 atom, which isn't that much money in the grand scheme of things. They could have, like, just made a million dollars. Like, I'm not even joking, obviously, you know, these people had to be patient to receive these airdrops. But I think, you know, I mean, if you stake Adam, you still get a bunch of airdrops.
00:09:39.766 - 00:10:32.890, Speaker A: For example, Adam stakers received the celestial airdrop. And I don't think anyone is, you know, sad about, you know, holding Adam down that much when you receive a token that looks like this. But if you look at Celestia, let's try to understand, like, what Celestia is. And look, I'm not going to pretend to be an expert when it comes to Celestia, but, you know, there's always this argument and I. I guess, yeah, this narrative argument around modular. The monolithic thesis and the modular thesis, similar to Ethereum, where you scale the base chain with, like, mainnet via l two s and l three s, and then there's also the monolithic narrative, which is like what Solana is trying to do, where instead of fragmenting liquidity across various l two s and app chains, let's try to build everything on one chain. And if it can actually scale, if one chain can actually scale, then that should be a better solution, at least on paper.
00:10:32.890 - 00:11:05.066, Speaker A: Can it actually work? Who knows? But part of Solana's appreciation are investors betting on that thesis? And maybe Solana is a good hedge against Ethereum in the upcoming cycle. I have no idea. I'm just thinking about these things in terms of probabilities. Vasilastia is. I'll link this in the description below, but it's a new scaling tech and it's also trying to, I guess, ride the modular narrative. And like I mentioned, I'm not going to try to be an expert. Without getting too technical, Celestia introduces the concept of modular blockchains.
00:11:05.066 - 00:11:51.260, Speaker A: So instead of long blockchain doing everything, modular blockchains specialize and optimize to form a given function. And they're trying to become the data avail data availability layer. And it's going to make it cheaper and easier for new developers to spin up new blockchains and new roll ups. And, you know, Celestia also scales with the number of users, and it could be an attractive value proposition if you're a developer trying to, you know, create a new roll up, for example. And, you know, Celestia's utility token roll ups need to buy TIA and stake it essentially to pay to use the solicit data availability layer. It's a proof of stake network. Like I mentioned, it bootstraps new roll ups, and then it should also allow for potential airdrops.
00:11:51.260 - 00:12:32.648, Speaker A: So let's talk about that. So if you look at the celestial ecosystem on their main website, and you look at the all section, there's all these apps, right? But if you look at any l one website, they're going to claim that they have hundreds of partnerships. But I mean, these partnerships is kind of like fake. It's like our new l one partners with link Chainlink to use their oracles. Cool, right? But everyone does that. It's not really like a real partnership, but solid steel, I think, is a little different. So, for example, if you look at this section roll ups as a service, all these projects should have a token.
00:12:32.648 - 00:12:51.570, Speaker A: And if you look into l one, l two tokens, they're usually worth a decent amount. And eclipse, for example, is interesting. I'm trying to load up the website here, for example. It's not loading, but I. Yeah, there you go. So I believe, yeah. So they're trying to become Ethereum's fastest L2, powered by the Solana virtual machine.
00:12:51.570 - 00:13:51.700, Speaker A: Of course, we kind of have to wait until this thing actually launches to see how viable this option is. But I mean, these, this is a bunch of buzzwords. They have a bunch of, you know, VC's investors that's gonna, you know, like try to make it a thing, you know, surely, I mean, this thing will probably launch at, let's say a $3 billion FDB. When it comes out, it's going to have a token and it uses Celestia and it's probably going to drop a token, and part of the token might go to Celestia stakers. You can say the same thing about things like Caldera and, you know, I mean, I'm not going to go through every single application on here, but going back to this thing, go back to the alt tab, you know, there's all these networks, and if you look at Manta Network, for example, actually, let's just not click. But Manta Network, they raised at a $500 million valuation. And I heard that it was confirmed that they're gonna give away some of the token to T's stakers.
00:13:51.700 - 00:14:38.760, Speaker A: So if you think about it, right, I mean, think about 2024, 2025 TS stakers should receive a decent amount of airdrops. So from a humble farmer's perspective, how do we capitalize? And of course, we don't really know, okay? Like the devs end up figuring out how the tokens are distributed and I have no insider information, but it's all about thinking and probabilities and trying to set up yourself for success. And if I think about it, okay, I think it's definitely plus ev for your money spent. Or, I mean, actually, I'm not gonna talk about it from your perspective. Right. I can only talk about it from my perspective because I'm literally a person on the Internet wearing a farmer's hat, holding a rake, making videos on the Internet. Definitely not financial advice.
00:14:38.760 - 00:15:32.120, Speaker A: Right. But, okay, like, in the next couple of years, TS stakers should receive airdrops. How do we maximize that opportunity? And if you look at past airdrops for Cosmos stakers, and look, I don't even know anything about this token, but Atom stake. If you held, if you staked at least 25 atom, or, you know, held 150 atom on your wallet, then you receive this och token airdrop, first ride. I believe if you held, yeah, so if you held ten, if you look at the Cosmos hover, right? If you held ten atom, I believe if you staked ten atom, you received this airdrop. And then for archway, I believe, yeah, if you stake at least 25 atom, you received these airdrops. And of course, the more tokens you staked, the more tokens you receive.
00:15:32.120 - 00:16:30.206, Speaker A: But I think developer and like teams should, you know, air towards the side of giving away, or I guess distributing more tokens towards smaller wallets. Because if you give most of your tokens to whales, then maybe that's not great for decentralization. It's really hard for developers to prevent civil attacks for buy humble farmers like you and I. But I think it makes sense for, let's say, at least stake 25 TIA across multiple wallets. And maybe that's going to be a good benchmark, a good starting point, and at current prices, that's going to be roughly $250. But let's say you want to stake 30 TIA across different wallets because you want to be safe, right? It's better to be safe than sorry. Maybe it makes sense for people to buy TIa across centralized exchanges or dexs like osmosis, and just spin up 1020, 30, 40, 50, even 100 wallets if you have the time and the money to do so.
00:16:30.206 - 00:17:09.623, Speaker A: Whatever makes sense for you. Of course, there's opportunity costs because, yes, Ti is up a lot. How much more can I go up? I have no idea. But I'm more thinking about it in terms of, okay, how much airdrops can I actually receive if I know, if I like. When I'm talking about this airdrop farming operation, I don't really care about the price of TIa. I only care about maximizing the amount of wallets that receive future airdrops that go into TIa stakers. And like I said, I'm not doing this yet, but I do want to do this by end of year because there's a decent chance that these teams, maybe they take a cut off, like a snapshot of TS stakers on December 31 or something.
00:17:09.623 - 00:17:18.791, Speaker A: I have no idea. But I will definitely do this. Maybe I'll do like 100 wallets if I have a time. Actually, that's a lot of work. Maybe I'm too lazy for that. And that's going to be a significant opportunity. Cost of capital.
00:17:18.791 - 00:17:59.870, Speaker A: But at least ten wallets, right? $300 across ten wallets, that's like $3,000. It's not some change. But I definitely think that if you just think about the EV, right? So, you know, expected value. So like, whatever, like, the payoff is, multiply that by the probability of all these outcomes happening. I mean, you know, even, even if Tia goes to zero and I lose $3,000, like, I think the EV, and like, the decision making that I like early, this decision making process, I think is definitely a plus Ev one. So definitely think it's worth considering. You know, there's a lot of demand for farming videos, which is understandable.
00:17:59.870 - 00:18:26.560, Speaker A: And, you know, I think Solan ecosystem, I think most of the opportunities have passed. I talked about l two farming opportunities in last week's video, which I think is pretty useful. But I think this time around, I mean, yeah, like maybe farming seamless, whatever this token ends up doing could be interesting. Maybe you farm and dump, you know, you farm this thing on chain, then you dump it on people buying this token on centralized exchanges. Cool. Okay. Like, I mean, that's my, that's my counterparty.
00:18:26.560 - 00:18:55.122, Speaker A: That's great. I. But if you want to talk about, I guess, positive, some thinking games, then, yeah. Like starting or at least thinking about a TIa staking airdrop farming operation probably makes sense. And it's definitely something I will do. Ideally, I do it when Tia goes down. But to be honest, given the nature and given like, the EV of like, this airdrop farming operation, even if Tia is trading at $50, I'll probably start do it right.
00:18:55.122 - 00:19:39.662, Speaker A: I'll do it regardless. And, you know, you can go to Kepler dashboard. I mean, Kepler is like the cosmos wallet. And Celestia, you can stake it for 17% APR, which comes from token inflation. And if you're going to stake it with someone, you should stake it with someone that, I mean, first of all, doesn't take 100% commissions. Okay, what the hell is that? You also shouldn't stake with centralized exchanges like Coinbase, because I think I forget what it was, but maybe it was these wallets. But anyways, like most tokens, they don't really give away tokens to centralized exchanges.
00:19:39.662 - 00:20:07.672, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. So tokens that were delegated, you know, didn't get the token. Or, sorry, if you staked with Coinbase, binance or Kraken, you didn't get it just because, well, like, decentralization concerns. I mean, sure. Like, that kind of makes sense. So who would I stake with? I mean, to be honest, you have to do your own research, maybe stake across multiple node operators. But, you know, like, I think it's definitely worth your time if you kind of agree with.
00:20:07.672 - 00:20:49.372, Speaker A: But the potential for ti air drop season probably going to be next year, probably not going to be an instant payoff, right? So no instant gratification here. Maybe if Tia goes up and whatnot. But hey, just be aware of it. Just keep it in your radar. And there's a chance that a year or two from now, we go back on this video and be like, wow, humble farmers that started the airdrop Celestia airdrop farming staking operation. That was smart money, right? That was smart money. And you definitely want to set your future self up for success because we're all living in the present, the now, and we only know what happens, or we only know what happened in the past and what we're living in right now.
00:20:49.372 - 00:21:30.342, Speaker A: And there's uncertainty around the future. But if you're trading, investing, doing whatever, we're all trying to set our future selves for success. So I always think about, okay, future Tyki, how do I make future tiki proud? And you should ask yourself the question if your name is Bobby, right? Like my name is Bobby. Like, how do I make future Bobby proud? And, yeah, like, just start thinking about these things because there's a lot, there's a lot of opportunities right now, like just buying tokens for capital appreciation, I suppose. But there's also other opportunities in the form of airdrop farming. So thank you guys for watching. Hope you guys enjoyed the video.
00:21:30.342 - 00:21:45.030, Speaker A: And I'll see you next week for a new edition of farmers of the week. Bye bye. And check out the premium discord link will be in the description below for humble farmer. Army research. I've been running this for over two years. Yeah. Check it out if you're interested.
00:21:45.030 - 00:21:48.330, Speaker A: No issues. If not. Okay, so thank you, astronomer. Bye.
