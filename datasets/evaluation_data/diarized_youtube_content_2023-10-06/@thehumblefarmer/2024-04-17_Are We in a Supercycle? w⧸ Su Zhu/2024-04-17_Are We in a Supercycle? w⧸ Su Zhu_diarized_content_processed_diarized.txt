00:00:00.280 - 00:00:21.158, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. So I understand Su is a controversial figure. However, I personally learned a lot from him last cycle, and I wanted to hear his takes on the current market. And if I'm doing that, then I might as well record a podcast, share it with the world, and anyone that wants to watch it can watch it. If you don't want to watch it, you don't have to watch it. No one's forcing you. So I think I recorded a pretty honest conversation with Su, so I hope you enjoy.
00:00:21.158 - 00:00:28.614, Speaker A: Thank you. What's up, everyone? Taiki here. Welcome to episode 17 of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I have Rickmi Suzu. How are you doing today?
00:00:28.742 - 00:00:29.566, Speaker B: Very good, and you?
00:00:29.638 - 00:00:37.358, Speaker A: Good, good. So I don't think you need intro, but can you just briefly tell us how you got into crypto and I guess your entire crypto journey, how you got here?
00:00:37.494 - 00:01:25.430, Speaker B: Sure. That's bitcoin very early on, but from seeing it being used, I heard about it when I was in Hong Kong and Macau, and then didn't really trade it that much. Just did some arbitrage later on, learned about ethic ICO, didn't buy it, but was watching that time, was doing foreign exchange, mainly emerging market ndfs, and then by sort of early 2018, it decided stop doing fx and just focus entirely on crypto. So that's when kind of the three ac journey proper as a crypto fund began. And we had a pretty good run over a few years, variety of strategies, liquid and illiquidgesthenne, um, alta and bitcoin. So it was good fun.
00:01:25.590 - 00:01:40.530, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, what allowed you to, I guess, leave forex to join or just go full or all in, into crypto in 2018? Because I think 2018 wasn't a great time to get into crypto. Uh, so, like, what did you see in the space back then that allowed you to just go all in?
00:01:41.390 - 00:02:25.940, Speaker B: So I had kind of seen, uh, the wealth creation, the rapid wealth creation in 2017. I had an equities trader who, um, kind of blew up his equities book on my firm, but he was so busy trading icos and trading Ethereum that he was like, whatever. And so I saw that I'm like, okay, there must be something more there that I need to focus on. So in early 2018, actually, there was a. There was a firm in Hong Kong called Census markets. And actually, I think this is the first time the story's ever been told on a podcast, but there were a few guys there that had just quit their banking jobs to start a crypto market, making firm, trading firm. And so we invested in that.
00:02:25.940 - 00:03:04.520, Speaker B: That was outside of three years at that time. And then later on we kind of, that firm did quite well. We did quite well on basis strategies back then. There's a lot of contango, a lot of funding trades, mainly BitMex, OKX, these two probably top two Bitfinex. And then by the end of 2018 we decided, why don't we wrap it into three arrows and just stop doing FX altogether and focus entirely on crypto. So kind of had some help getting there from bringing in new people. I think that's always important as well, to make sure that you align yourself with talent whenever you can.
00:03:06.180 - 00:03:21.812, Speaker A: Yeah. And how was the, I guess the last bull cycle? I remember you did the GBTC trade, you were just farming things during DeFi summer. Can you just tell us about your memorable trades, maybe biggest wins, biggest losses and the biggest lessons that you took.
00:03:21.836 - 00:03:51.570, Speaker B: Away from those trades, maybe starting with grayscale. Grayscale was a really good trade because at the time, actually everyone thought the trade was already dead because it had been around for a few years, really. Grayscale Ethereum was kind of how we made a lot of money really fast because at the time 2019, people thought Ethereum was kind of dead. Anyways, its a very high bitcoin dominance environment. I think ether versus bitcoin was around the 0.018 to 0.03 range at that time.
00:03:51.570 - 00:04:32.712, Speaker B: It had reached an zero four during the Constantinople hard fork and then that was the one where they actually reduced POW issuance from three to two. And so everyone bought it thinking that, okay, now it's finally going to rally. And then it proceeded to have again versus bitcoin, very similar to the merge, um, price action wise. But anyway, so it was in the backdrop of very, very weak, uh, demand for anything related to Ethereum. And so Grayscale had announced their Ethereum trust was going live and, and um, you know, like JBC was yielding around 25% but you have to wait a year. So it was really, and it was 2% management fee. So it was like kind of like a 20% trade.
00:04:32.712 - 00:05:11.410, Speaker B: People did it, but no one did it on any kind of looping and no one did it. Kind of thinking they're going to hit the ball to the park by then. And a lot of people thought it was actually going to die at some point because it's going to arb to zero or something, but no one thought it good in discount. People just thought eventually get Arb zero. So they thought it was like a waste of capital. Now, we decided to go really big on Grayscale Ethereum because we just thought, okay, well, there's a nice convexity there because if in a year there's demand for Ethereum and no one has these shares besides us, then it's a nice trade to have and you can set your own price. So that ended up playing out really well.
00:05:11.410 - 00:05:46.628, Speaker B: Where it was around 400% premium, it wouldn't say as high as 1000% premium. But I think in terms of realized premium, probably realized around 300%. So it's kind of a quick way to, you know, forex your ether stack. Um, so, and that was really good. Another, I guess, key thing we did starting to do then is that, you know, we realized that, well, grayscale ether, you know, there's people willing to lend against this because it is good collateral, right. Or, you know, reasonable collateral. So someone, if they're lending dollars, lending ether, they can lend against it.
00:05:46.628 - 00:06:42.794, Speaker B: So we realized that then we could, you know, do that trade while continuing to do other trades. So kind of having a multi dimensional portfolio. And so I think we were really good at doing that multidimensional portfolio where the collateral is being used to then do farming. I mean, the collateral is in a longer term trade while the loans are then used to do other trades. So that was really good. I think that backdrop also allowed us to do like farming really well because when compound first launched, actually also very similar to Athena this cycle where the dollar yields are like 500% to begin with, later drip dropping down to 100%. But that was something where you wanted to basically double sided farm Dai on compound when it launched, farm on the highest leverage, you can basically to get the comp rewards because they were rewarding borrowing and lending, essentially.
00:06:42.794 - 00:07:20.160, Speaker B: So you can just deposit it and withdraw the same asset repeatedly. Right. It's kind of a, it pumps up the TVL figures, but it's actually really absurd that you get paid for it. Yeah, but you know, that was the environment of DeFi summer. So, you know, we did that trade, but the key, I think, where we kind of did it really well versus other people is that we were like, well, you still need to keep the ether exposure or the bitcoin exposure, because if you don't have the exposure, you are then risking like either just doubles and then your yield is kind of pointless. Right? So think around that time, either was around 300 or 400 range. There were big sellers at 400 repeatedly at that time, some big funds.
00:07:20.160 - 00:07:54.154, Speaker B: Um, and so, you know, we, we were, while we were farming 200%, we then bought, like eth futures, then ETH options as well as bitcoin options, basically to try to keep that upside exposure using the yield. And I think that that's a, that's usually a good strategy when yields are very high. Probably also means the market's in a pump because, you know, money that doesn't exist in a vacuum, right. If people are willing to pay you high funding, they, like, they have to be making money at some point. If they're not making money, then it's going to be an implosion, like a massive one. So either it's going to be a massive implosion or everybody wins. That's typically the right way to think about it.
00:07:54.154 - 00:08:45.880, Speaker B: So then if everyone's going to win on the long side, too, you're simply getting a cut from financing it. So you might as well make sure you also eat the, you know, eat from both meals, I guess, is the way to say it. So that we did well separate from all that we did venture. The first was really Darabit, and then we also bought a lot of saps under the basic premise that there was an unlock premium that was happening each time where, because 2018, end of 2018 was so brutal, most people thought these products would kind of die. So you could buy them and on main net they would already start pumping because they simply shipped and you could access a wider range of people that would be part of that community. So, you know, Polkadot, Solana, Avalanche, Filecoin, there's a number dfinity, there's a number of these that we did in various sizes. Probably the most famous one we're most famous for is probably Polkadot in 2020.
00:08:45.880 - 00:09:31.284, Speaker B: But we did Solana as well. And we did a few others. And then I think 2020, 2021, we did some, you know, locked trades where you're buying Avax locked. And then, and then in the ecosystem fund, there was near Luna Mina, a few of these other ones, too, where it's kind of, you're buying at pretty big discount and then, you know, you're locked for some period of time. So I think it probably would have been wise to sell spot and then buy that round. But, you know, we didn't really tend to do that, actually. We'll be curious what would have happened if we did, because maybe it would have been like not much of a pump, but then it would have been like a smoother ride in some of these coins, especially in near, probably the most obvious one.
00:09:31.284 - 00:10:29.594, Speaker B: But yeah, I think it was a good mix of strategies, kind of opportunistic also directional. So I think that was kind of a, that was kind of a backdrop where I think the liquidity mismatch between the books, you don't really think about as much in a bull market, because liquidity mismatches kind of get shrugged away. A good example of that is now with staked ether, right. There is actually still a liquidity mismatch between ether and staked ether. But in a bull market, you don't have to care so much because it's like, well, it trades at 99.5% maybe, but if you get a big systemic risk, then for a few days you can possibly get a very, very big deep peg. So I think that liquidity mismatch was kind of where we earned a lot of money before, and then also where we paid a high price, where a lot of the portfolio was stuck in a liquid stuff, that everyone had the same positions.
00:10:29.594 - 00:10:34.786, Speaker B: So pretty much, yeah, I remember last.
00:10:34.818 - 00:11:16.890, Speaker A: Cycle very vividly where I remember you doing the compound trade, where no one really knew how to value these tokens. So as soon as they saw TVL go up the token pumped. So when you were just lending and borrowing Dai and just looping it, it's very reflexive in the sense that, I mean, I did it for Matic as well, where, you know, I couldn't really afford 8 million fees back then, but I just went to polygon cheap chain and then I taught people how to like a lever loop farm. But I guess the question is, you know, they say history often repeats, but it often rhymes. What similarities do you think you see this cycle to last cycle and how are things different? Do you think the market has matured more and how does it affect how you trade? I guess the liquid and private markets.
00:11:17.670 - 00:11:45.640, Speaker B: I think its matured in some sense. In other ways. I think the same games get obfuscated or reskinned rather. So I think a good example of that I think is lending. I think theres going to be a very weak OTC lending market, but it is starting to come back. I also think that with ETF's collateral, that's going to be a lending market that gets quite big at some point at banks, potentially, if there is a huge market collapse at some point banks might actually be in trouble because they have to liquidate. ETf's very fast.
00:11:45.640 - 00:12:28.486, Speaker B: But I think defi side people understand that the pool two game doesn't work. So if you try to do that, no one will play it because they'll already do kind of an inductive thinking and say okay, or reverse induction from the future and say, okay, what is the last step? Okay, it's gonna die. Okay, so then the next last step, also gonna die. So it's gonna die right now. So, you know, that's why you haven't really seen, like, Olympus forks do well or kind of, you know, pool two games do well in general. These kinds of crypto mechanism games are just reminding people that it's gonna end at some point. And smart money, you know, also wants to be where new money is, right? They want to be where meme coins are.
00:12:28.486 - 00:13:16.186, Speaker B: So I think that's one way where I think the market has gotten more efficient, I guess you call it, and that they don't want to play those games, but then they're also playing other games where it's still obfuscated. Right? Like when a meme coin launch, you know, some of them are fair, but of course, a lot of them are also, you know, the team snipes the supply, and then there's a whole way that these are done. So I think I. That the game is always changing, right? But general mechanisms are quite similar, I think, in terms of farming. I think Athena is a good example of a very high yield that happened because of basically locking. When you stake in Athena, when you stake USD, you're getting the perp yield, but you're forgoing the shards. You're not getting as many shards, but you have liquidity too.
00:13:16.186 - 00:13:48.120, Speaker B: Like, you. You could, in theory, dump your s USD in the market. Then when you lock USD, it's still seven days, but you can't sell it anymore, but you get a bunch of shards. So essentially, I think that's a cool design because it's like they're. They're giving you Cirque supply, right? They're giving you cirque supply up front to make sure that the TVL grows fast, early, and gets mind share. So it's a yemenite. It's very well done in that because the protocol is still undervalued, or felt like it's undervalued.
00:13:48.120 - 00:14:31.700, Speaker B: What you're getting doesn't need to dump, necessarily. And then they make you restake it, right? Because if you have your Ena, you need your Ena to stake so that you get the bonus yield. Say it's similar to pendle, similar to, like, pretty much everything. That curve, you know, that. That has had that model where these models break down is further along wherever that is no longer true, that the coin is cheap enough that someone can buy it on its own, and then it becomes a mechanistic game where it's like, okay, let's force people to buy it who don't really want to buy it, and then make them lose money. And then hopefully it's going to be okay. But seems they're not quite there yet, but yeah, and then obviously points is the big mechanism of this cycle.
00:14:31.700 - 00:15:22.662, Speaker B: And I think it's actually too early to say still, if points are going to work. I think they've definitely worked in some cases and not in others. I think that naturally, if you really think about it, it's just the same as a pool two, except we don't let the pool two trade. Where people are farming, people are, let's say, doing something semi irrational in a pool one to then get the new coin. And so the pool two game in the past was, well, the new coin you get, we're going to give you 10,000% apy versus either. So then that way you're not going to always dump your pool to coin. You might actually farm with it or buy more of it, right? And all that, you know, kind of dies when a few whales nuke pool two and then it's over because the 10,000 API doesn't account for it doesn't compensate when you go down 80% a day or something.
00:15:22.662 - 00:15:56.716, Speaker B: So points is quite similar where points is like, okay, I'm giving you something, you don't know what it is or you don't know quite how much it's worth. A. But if it's optically high enough, then you might start doing some dumb stuff, hoping that. Hoping that when the points go live, then that's actually worth something. But it could be that everything you've done is pointless, right? It's a bit like if your, if your mom tells you, if you do your homework for five years, then at the end of the day, you know, you rack all these points, and then at the end of five years, she's like, well, knowledge. Knowledge was your reward, right? You already got so much knowledge, you don't need any more reward. And then you might be like, huh, maybe.
00:15:56.716 - 00:16:24.354, Speaker B: But you scammed me, mom. Right? So, you know, that, that, that's something that is just very obvious. So I think that's why, you know, margin fi. You see a bit of angst when they're like, where are my tokens? And then, you know, friend tag the. I think they did it really well where they just gave up the tokens. The VC's gave up the tokens. It's going to be a lot of popularism, though, because I think unlike with tokens, where you do the tokens, points is super centralized.
00:16:24.354 - 00:16:41.198, Speaker B: They can just make shit up all day, right? They can. Next week, say, we're going to dilute everyone who's been farming it. We're going to do triple bonus points coins for like two months now. Everyone was doing it before then pulled. They're like super rugged. Or you could do like one year bonus. Or you could say, like, at the launch of the token, you say, okay, anyone who pulled before launch, they don't count.
00:16:41.198 - 00:17:12.472, Speaker B: Like, it's just completely made up. Right? So that's good and bad, right? It's good in the sense that you have less, like exploitation farming potentially, but it's bad in that, you know, there's going to be a lot of pressure to, you know, if the points don't perform well, it's. It's just dead. Right. So, you know, blast. We're kind of seeing that angst as well because, you know, it's. People are now not sure if this stuff is worth anything.
00:17:12.472 - 00:17:32.450, Speaker B: They spend a lot of time farming it. In a way, it's like a negative. It's a vicious cycle because as the community gets, like, more mad, new people are going to be like, you farm this just to dump on me? Why? Why would I buy it? Right? It's like, it seems ridiculous because the anger creates bad vibes, which creates more bad vibes. And then eventually people just like, screw it.
00:17:33.070 - 00:17:53.286, Speaker A: Yeah. It's like the reflexivity in vibes. It feels like this cycle with points and like, all these things, we're just rehypothecating the same system that we created last cycle. But I guess now with points that projects have more power. It's similar to how. Yeah, like with blast, Pac man just keeps issuing more points. And now there's gold.
00:17:53.286 - 00:18:09.606, Speaker A: And Pac man says if you bridge out a blast, you lose all your points. And then we had Machu big brother lose punt, $5 million. Or he lost like $5 million or something in apes. And then he got like a million dollars with a blur and he's like, all right, fuck this. But he still keeps playing the game because I think maybe he has a gambling addiction or something.
00:18:09.718 - 00:18:34.306, Speaker B: Yeah. Points, I think, is one cool thing, is that it's a bit like a loot box where you're like, I'm not sure if I was rugged, if I was unlucky, or if it's better not luck next time. Whereas a pool two, it's more obvious exactly what's happening. Like, well, whales are nuking or like, there's not enough demand because you don't know what the demand for points is right now. Like, no one knows what the demand for Eigen layer points really is. No one knows that, right? It's. It's.
00:18:34.306 - 00:19:02.768, Speaker B: It's priced off, let's say, celestia or priced off something else, but no one knows what that's worth. So that is structurally the problem. And, like, points are often died off other points, right? So, you know, in the case of like, re. Like, restaking points, like, those are, there's probably no genuine demand for it. They can only value it. Versus, like, other points, like Etherfi token is live. And so that gives a.
00:19:02.768 - 00:20:07.580, Speaker B: It gives a comparable to value against. But it's very pyramidic in the sense that everything is valuing off one thing, which itself is not very liquid. So, like, the question is how many people are willing to buy it versus how many people are willing to do many irrational actions hoping to get it. And that's exactly what GBC is, right? Because GBDC is a relatively thinly traded stock at a premium to bitcoin. And you're sitting there, you're saying, okay, how many people are going to do actions that they wouldn't normally do, like, lock up their bitcoin in a trust, uh, to then, uh, try to sell that to somebody, right? And then if you think about it, the ratio of people who put in to do that versus people willing to buy it, premium was like maybe 100 to one at some point, right? Um, in large part because neo bank models, they got client bitcoin and they said, okay, let's put it into a GPDC trade because what else are we gonna do with it, right? There's no other yield. You're gonna put it in badger. You're gonna put it in, you know, aave, like, it's just not real yield, not good enough yield, right? So, you know, I think it's something where people are doing it because everyone else is doing it and then everyone else is doing it.
00:20:07.580 - 00:20:34.520, Speaker B: Makes it now seem like, okay, it's a launch pool that this coin that we all got together and made could make, could be worth something and that actually. So pool two works in the beginning, right? Let's keep in mind wi Fi worked, and that's why everything else then came and why I and yfi too, also worked. So it's something where it does work until it doesn't. So the first ones work and then the last ones don't. So timing is everything.
00:20:35.620 - 00:21:15.156, Speaker A: Yeah. And with all these pull two, quote, unquote Ponzis. The cost to reproduce new ones are so low that if one thing works then people just keep making new ones and then it dilutes the bid because there's limited amount of capital in crypto and then things start to collapse. And speaking of a collapse, I do want to talk about one thing you mentioned earlier around implosions. And you know, you entered the e trade during a high bitcoin dominance regime where etc was also hovering around 0.04. And you know, right now I think bitcoin dominance roughly around 57% EPTC hitting new lows. Where do you think we are in the cycle? Do you think we're.
00:21:15.156 - 00:21:27.568, Speaker A: I think in unsteady lads, we a different podcast we did, you said like maybe we're in early 2020. Do you still think that were early to mid cycle vibes or do you think that were later on?
00:21:27.664 - 00:22:06.082, Speaker B: I think its still relatively early to mid cycle. I think that normies are starting to come down and I also think that a lot of family office money is getting quite interested in crypto, especially because they dont like the opportunities in Shatfi as much. Commercial real estate is in trouble. There's a lot of issues in some emerging markets and so I think that'll create a big bid over time. I think that retail will probably come a bit later in the cycle. They're coming. Actually, the meme coin frenzy is still mainly natives playing meme coins.
00:22:06.082 - 00:23:02.338, Speaker B: It's almost like NFT traders playing meme coins and then wealth effects from crypto natives trading meme coins. Because if you even look at the type of meme coins being traded, like you asked the man on the street, he doesn't know these memes. In fact, he'll be shocked when you tell him what the mcaps are. So the man on the street is not here yet to play meme coins, but he is starting to hear that meme coins are back. So I think that's kind of around crypto. Love analogies, but I think kind of analogy is a little bit broken because you've already broken all time high before having, which hasn't happened before. So either it's like an acceleration and that means we're going to like also be a shorter cycle, like a left translated cycle, or it's going to be something more like, you know, fewer dips now and then it's just like less supply.
00:23:02.338 - 00:23:03.098, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:03.274 - 00:23:26.832, Speaker A: So yeah. What do you think about cycle theory? Because, you know, obviously you came up with the super cycle and then because we hit all time highs worth having, people are saying, oh, this is going to be a shorter cycle, left handed cycle. How do you think about, do you even use cycle theory when it comes to trading the majors and altcoins and, yeah, like, how does this affect your views?
00:23:26.896 - 00:23:57.986, Speaker B: I think it's somewhat, I think it's somewhat useful, but I think that you have to also take each situation differently because know, each cycle you have random stuff happening that are kind of exogenous to the system. Right. Like two cycles ago it was ethereum and smart contracts. So if youre trading bitcoin on cycle theory, you know, its useful, but youre missing a lot of the point of that cycle. Right. And this cycle really is a solana led cycle. Now, if we really zoom out a lot and its actually dragged down by other stuff to a large extent, and then its a bitcoin ETF cycle as well.
00:23:57.986 - 00:25:03.984, Speaker B: So, you know, I think that that is, psychotherapy doesn't really account for that kind of stuff. Well. And I also think that there's a lot of fundamentals that are shifting on different chains. So I think people probably would be better served by some kind of a broad time based analysis. I do think that toward the end of this year is going to be an event you want to start selling into because I think that the likelihood of next year in the spring, there being more volatility in all directions, this gets higher and higher because I think actually right now we're in a low volatility regime still, even with this weekend up, it's still relatively low volatility on bitcoin. We haven't seen a 25%, 30% dips, in part because I think of the unit bias as well. Like when the numbers are very high, the volatility is decreasing in part because like a $1,000 move now, now looks like a dip to buy, whereas that's like $30 when it's 3000.
00:25:03.984 - 00:25:43.050, Speaker B: So you wouldn't buy a $30 dip, but you might buy $1,000 dip even though percentage wise it's like the same. Right. So that's one cool thing about like a very, very high unit price, which is that it just feels like you're buying dips even though it's like small percentages. That's one reason why I think bitcoin is up for me either, actually, because bitcoin, like the dips, like, you know, would you rather buy a $1,000 dip on bitcoin or a $100 dip on ether? Right. Getting more dollars when you buy the bitcoin dip. So you got to buy the bigger dip. So I think that's actually a big effect for normies, especially because, you know, it's.
00:25:43.050 - 00:25:58.300, Speaker B: I think the bitcoin price action now looks very logical to normies. Theyre like, this makes sense. ETF's got approved, halving is coming. Everythings just logical. And so that theyre like, I totally get bitcoin now. Before, maybe I thought it was a scam or was confused, but now I just get it.
00:26:00.040 - 00:26:44.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely, my partner or my fiance, she thinks she dog crypto was a scam last cycle, and now shes like, oh, yeah, bitcoin kind of makes sense. I definitely agree with, I guess, your take on the normie mindset. And speaking of big corrections, a couple days ago, we're recording this on Monday the 15th, but we saw a huge wipe across the board when it comes to altcoin. So bitcoin and ether didn't flinch that much. But just general altcoins down anywhere from 20% to 80%. And I do want to share this post that I saw on Twitter, and I'm not trying to, you know, poke fun or anything, but we had this account where crypto nerd said, just woke up and realized I got liquidated overnight. I was three x long five.
00:26:44.666 - 00:27:09.094, Speaker A: I lost everything I had, don't have much in the bank account, had a million dollars in binance. Lost everything. Feels really bad. And fortunately, I think Binance has an 83% liquidation ratio. So he still has 180k left. And he's grateful, uh, that he could, he can run it up again. But as someone that, you know, ran it up huge and then, you know, just experienced huge drawdowns.
00:27:09.094 - 00:27:34.664, Speaker A: Um, how do you bounce back mentally from events like this? Um, and after, you know, or I guess, you know, people watching this, maybe they drew down ten to 80%, depending on the type of altcoins they hold or they held. Uh, you know, how. How do you bounce back after these, these wipes out, uh, these wipeouts? Do you just keep chugging along because you still believe in the cycle? Yeah. Like, how do you read the.
00:27:34.712 - 00:28:14.102, Speaker B: If you. If you. If you read the market wizards, the, like, tratfi version, pretty much all the big traders have had big blow ups early in their career. It's just a matter of when it is and how it's done. So I think that there's actually, like, a pretty high correlation with having blown up a few times and being plus ev. It's simply a misestimation of how high the EV is relative to the risk of ruin. So risk of ruin is something that is harder to price on a daily basis because whenever the day doesn't, it doesn't happen, then you're like, oh, it doesn't matter.
00:28:14.102 - 00:28:58.982, Speaker B: Right. So I think that, like, know that it's part of your journey, I think, and also know that it's not a, it's not a big deal in the day, right? Like, if you think about, like, simply Jesse Livermore, he made and lost a billion, like, three times. Like, that's not, not a big deal, right? You just do it ten times. If you want, you can do a hundred times. But the, but the thing is, like, the key is to learn from each time and then make sure you don't, like, get greedy and try to, like, win back your loss fast and, like, regroup, figure out what you did wrong, figure out if your process is wrong. You know, like, I know traders where, you know, they'll have someone monitor their account. If it draws down too much, they, like, lock them out.
00:28:58.982 - 00:29:22.690, Speaker B: You know, that actually is a good practice. If you, if you find that that tilt is the main problem for you. Like, I used to work at a prop trading firm in Singapore and, you know, a sister firm nearby. Like, they would turn off your computer. If you drew down, like, $2,000, the computer would just shut down. The positions would get auto closed, and then you'd be sent home. And it sounds stupid, but that's how you risk manage, like, 100 traders in an arcade.
00:29:22.690 - 00:30:29.266, Speaker B: You just say, look, I don't care what your reason is, but you lost money, so you're obviously not doing well that day. So go home, think about it, and come back tomorrow. So, you know, obviously trading with that kind of a risk limit, you actually will have a lot more discipline because you're like, okay, I'm actually trading the best setups. Do I know what I'm doing? Am I just gambling? Am I just speculating? So I think that, you know, if you're someone who takes a lot of positions and you don't quite size them properly to your risk, you know, having that kind of a drawdown experience is actually really useful for, say, okay, what is your actual alpha? How do you harness and finesse that alpha and not, you know, let it creep into all sorts of other things? I think that there's a tendency to treat trading as a, as a sport, which I think is, is the right way to think about it. Like, it's less so of a game, actually. I think to think of it as a game is actually a mistake because, yes, it's a game. But if you believe it's just a game, you won't take it as seriously as you should.
00:30:29.266 - 00:31:13.630, Speaker B: Whereas if you think of it as a sport, you know, think about it as something that you're continuously getting better or worse at based on what's happening. That requires your mental focus as well and requires your physical focus. I think that making a game implies that you can just lose the game, press restart button and play again, or you just reload, GG reload or respawn. Whereas you can't actually do that. You know, kind of balance it in a way that you can learn from mistakes, you can risk, manage appropriately. I think that that's really important. But at the same time, like, assuming you do end up blowing up, you know, a big account.
00:31:13.630 - 00:32:03.782, Speaker B: I known so many people in crypto who grind, who've grown back from, like, losing, like 90% plus, I know at least 100, I think. So that's part of the beauty of crypto, which is that it just takes one, or especially at smaller sizes, it just takes one or two big ideas to make it all back. And actually, you know, it's like the hard times, make tough men thing, it's like, you know, having had that, you're supposed to then, you know, grind the trenches. I mean, how many posts have we seen, like, last couple of months ago, where it's like, I lost it all in FTX, everything went liquid. I couldn't get any access, but then I made it. I've regained my FTX highs and more, and it's like, you know, maybe they're farming airdrops by following guys like you, or maybe they're, you know, doing other things, but, like, there's just so many opportunities, it's actually kind of insane. And so I think that, you know, if you, if you focus more on, like, oh, gosh, like, you know, I can't do it anymore.
00:32:03.782 - 00:32:38.440, Speaker B: I can do it again. I mean, it's, um, it's quite defeatist because you also know that other people have done it, right? Like, in fact, if you know how to do it once, it's much easier the second time because it's like a, think about, like, a road that you've gone down and you've seen it and you come back again. You know, roughly how the road goes, maybe, like, there's branches that have fallen, trees that have fallen, but you know, roughly what it looks like to do that and think of it as a challenge right at that point where it's like, okay, let's do it again.
00:32:39.900 - 00:32:52.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess by learning through experience, we have to have an innate belief in ourselves that we can do it, because otherwise, you know, people that draw down, you just leave, but the people that stick around, they just keep grinding.
00:32:53.600 - 00:33:11.496, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, if you don't have that belief in yourself in the first place, you should not enter trading at all because that's not a, that's not something that suits you, right. Because you have to. Essentially, when you're trading as a market, you're saying the market is mispricing something. So I'm going to do an action. I'm going to risk capital that is trying to prove that the market is wrong. Right.
00:33:11.496 - 00:33:53.004, Speaker B: Whether you're buying or selling. So if you don't have the desire to wager your beliefs versus the common beliefs versus market beliefs, then you shouldn't even be putting yourself in a position to draw down. So if that's the case, when there's no shame in that as well, then, you know, you can just hold, or you can just, you know, put in cold storage or you can have your friend hold, you know, in some kind of managed thing. And that's a common approach for a lot of people, right. Especially what I've noticed that as people have more money, they become more humble because they've also seen more. So, you know, if you meet family, obviously, well, they'll be like, you know, they use a lot of advisors. They use a lot of like, safeguards, maybe several levels of safeguards.
00:33:53.004 - 00:34:30.472, Speaker B: It's because they know after seeing multiple generations and multiple things, they've just seen all the folly that humans can do if they have a lot of discretion, right? At the same time, this is never going to create wealth. Right? Like, that's also why second gen, third gen is very hard to create wealth, because in this mentality, all you can do is preserve wealth. You can't really create wealth. Right. So there, there is that kind of inherent, inherent contradiction in that to create great wealth, you have to take great risk, but to preserve great wealth, you have to take incredible, like, you have to have incredible paranoia.
00:34:30.616 - 00:35:12.636, Speaker A: Yeah. And I, I want to talk about this tweet where I think last cycle you had this thing around linear welt versus log welt. I guess to be more broad, to give you more room to talk about things. I often get this question whenever I interview guests for this podcast where if someone has, let's say, five figures low to mid five figures, how do they get to, let's say, seven figures, you know, what kind of trades that they should or what kind of trade should people be looking into. And how do people find these asymmetric risk word trades that can really give people an asymmetric.
00:35:12.668 - 00:35:33.366, Speaker B: Sure, sure. So at the five figures mark, you literally will just want to try every single project that anyone ever talks to you about. And you should try it. Have a spreadsheet, stay organized, know, like how to claim the airdrop, know the discord links, know everything, and just do this. Last cycle, DyDx airdrop was worth half a million dollars, I think.
00:35:33.558 - 00:35:34.638, Speaker A: Yeah, that's crazy.
00:35:34.694 - 00:36:24.712, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you just use that once. So I think that, you know, this cycle, for instance, if you. If you just bought remelios and spread them across wallets, don't, don't put them on one wallet, you're gonna start getting a lot of airdrops, like the, you know, one you get back almost all your principal, like, in one go, right? So I think that look for spots like that where, you know, you get rewarded, like in a non linear way, kind of. And I mean, you're obviously an expert in that space. I think that. I think that other than that, you know, it's a lot of it is about like playing event driven, playing opportunistic, where again, you have an edge because you can come in and out and it's quite okay.
00:36:24.712 - 00:37:05.598, Speaker B: Liquidity for you, whereas for other guys, it not. So whether that's like meme coin sniping launches, or whether it's like, think about, like a lot of meme coins. If you had strategies where you buy them once they reach a certain volume profile or like the go to profile, you would have cashed with, you would have cashed slurp, you would have cashed much other ones, bowdoin. And if you're disciplined enough, like, one of them pays for 100 losses, right? Or 50 losses, and even your losses are not going to be total losses. So I think that that kind of, that kind of framework, like, we'll look for convexity. You know that you're going to need convexity to make it 100 x. So, like, anything which is less convex, you try to avoid.
00:37:05.598 - 00:37:43.060, Speaker B: So something that's like less convex is like, like, like trading like ether versus bitcoin or Solana versus ether or something like that. Like, that's not convex. That's for the whales. So you leave that game for the whales, and for you, you figure out like the five to seven game, which is like, just takes like, you do higher dd than other people. You have some info edge that, okay, this is coming out. Events coming out. You catch one coin pumping, like three x on, you know, from going from maybe 50 to 150 mark cap, that's pretty much all you need, right? Like, last year, there were so many coins that went 30 x even in bear market, right? Like, rollbit was like a 30 x in a bear market.
00:37:43.060 - 00:38:09.938, Speaker B: Flex was a 800 x in a bear market. Obviously, liquid wise, maybe more like a 20 x in a bear market. Unibot. So there's always those opportunities. You will definitely have to catch some of them in order to grow your account size. If you don't catch any of them and you're trading just majors, your account's too small to actually trade majors, in my opinion. And you're actually very likely to get liquidated in doing so.
00:38:09.938 - 00:38:52.356, Speaker B: And so you don't catch that natural convexity that crypto gives, which is that populism stuff where you can get one DYDX airdrop and make half a million dollars. Think about forecaster, another great example, which I miss, unfortunately. But the DJ and airdrop, I believe, is, like $100,000 if you just use it five times. And again, it's an app where you're like, I'm not sure why I can expect forecaster Airdrop to give me 100k, but that's the humility required to be a small scale count, trying to go big, because it's like, you will never know the reasons why for things. You just know that, okay, people are talking about it potentially. There's Alpha. I mean, friends is another great example, right? Um, I remember I was chose frontside very early on by Evan, uh, Evan ss six.
00:38:52.356 - 00:39:11.350, Speaker B: And I. And I joined because of him, and then, you know, went through a phase in the middle where, like, no one used it. And they're like, okay, Fred egg is dead. Racers a scammer, blah, blah, blah. And then that's what they renounced, like, all the team points and the vc points. Now it's like, resurgence, it's coming back huge. So it's like, just don't.
00:39:11.350 - 00:39:31.122, Speaker B: Don't overthink it. Like, don't. Don't think you can predict deterministically exactly what happens in the future. You really can't. But you want to put yourself in a position where you're doing things that if they worked and they made sense, people could say, of course that makes sense. But then you don't actually know that it will happen. You can do maybe ten of those things, and most of them won't actually happen, but the one that does, it'll pay a lot of money.
00:39:31.122 - 00:39:40.470, Speaker B: And the ones that didn't they don't even cost you money. Like, if you sign up for these things, it doesn't cost you much money either. So, um, yeah, stay humble, base.
00:39:40.850 - 00:40:11.516, Speaker A: Yeah. I think this is why poker players do really well in crypto. Um, there's this element of pattern recognition. Um, it's like, I have one analyst, uh, that, like, farmed Jiro Sol across, I think, like, ten wallets, spent, like, 50 minutes, and he got, like, a 100k airdrop. I was like, oh, my God. I was, like, coping so hard because I can't believe I missed the Jito airdrop. And then immediately after I saw that, I started to, like, stake Tia across a bunch of wallets, because, I mean, I had no expectations, but I don't have to risk that much capital.
00:40:11.516 - 00:40:36.398, Speaker A: I can just spread it across a bunch of wallets and just wait for things to come. And then I got, like, the diameter drop, which was really big. And, you know, obviously, when you're doing these things, you don't really know if it's going to happen, but you want to put yourself in a position to succeed if you do get lucky. And I think that's kind of the mentality you have to have when you trying to run up a low, let's say, five to six. Figure four.
00:40:36.574 - 00:41:04.690, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. There's a venture component, like the venture mentality, too. Like, if you ask venture guys, they'll, of course, show you their bags, but they'll also say, look, I also know that most stuff will fail because that's the structure of venture in the first place. So they're actually extremely humble in that they don't say, I know this will, for a fact, succeed. And then, ironically, for a lot of higher leveraged purpose traders, they'll be like, I just know bitcoin isn't a pump. I know it. Or, I know that ether is going to dump.
00:41:04.690 - 00:41:39.146, Speaker B: That element of humility is very much needed for convexity, like, uh, exposure. Because to be able to have convexity in your portfolio like that, you have to, uh. Like, ironically, it takes more humility to hold a coin for 100 x than to just sell it for five or ten x. Because if you are very certain that you're like, okay, I know it's top because of these reasons, and then do it. Whereas if you're humble, you may say, I don't. I don't. You know, I've already been up on this coin.
00:41:39.146 - 00:42:24.440, Speaker B: I don't know why it will keep pumping, but I'm humble. I'm already in the trade, and I have no reason to, let's say, let the market do its work kind of thing. Because the problem with over certainty in those aspects too, is that you'll inevitably fall bias to psychology. You'll basically be looking for reasons to do something. And the thing about the market is that whatever you look for reasons to do something, you always find you can look for reasons to either take off or add or close. You can always find those reasons. So if you already have an implicit bias of what you want to do, then overvaluing reason versus, let's say, a more stoic venture like process is really important.
00:42:24.440 - 00:42:44.690, Speaker B: Like that example that you gave, right? It's like it takes very little time, but it takes humility to do so. Because if it was wasted time, you'd be like, I wasted all my time splitting across hundred wallets. I'm an idiot. But if you're humble, you're like, whatever, probably waste of time. Maybe it's not just, who cares? Just do it.
00:42:47.030 - 00:42:50.530, Speaker A: That's literally the expectation. I was like, fuck it, I'm just going to do it.
00:42:50.830 - 00:43:11.786, Speaker B: I saw a lot of arrogant traders last cycle where they're mainly trading perks on Bitmax or OKX. And when Defi started out, they're like, what is this defi shit? It's so small. Call me when it's big. And then, wait a second. You guys all made 100 x, right? So. Yeah, and so that, that happens every cycle. Like whatever you think you're doing is like more important.
00:43:11.786 - 00:43:23.190, Speaker B: You know it better, it's a better game. It's all these things probably like, probably the small guy that's starting to do it, he's gonna, he's gonna mog you quite hard this cycle. It's just quite guaranteed.
00:43:23.490 - 00:43:36.470, Speaker A: Yeah, because I guess for something to go 100 x, it has to be so out of consensus. Because if everyone thinks it's good, then chances are people own it and it's already up a lot. But if everyone thinks it's a piece of shit, it's like in the shitters.
00:43:36.930 - 00:44:14.172, Speaker B: Exactly. Like Ox is a great example right now because like, you know, TCR bought it. And then I see some chats, like, did he really buy it? Why would he buy it? It's like. But it's like the fact that you don't almost believe that he bought, even though he like very clearly deducts it to buy it, just proves that, like why he's much better than you, right? Which is that he can buy it before his consensus and then sell it to you once you all believe it. So it's like that. Like, that element of. Of the few versus the many is ubiquitous in crypto, where ultimately the few buy from the many and the few sell to the many because of math, right? Like, there's this notion people have, like, that everyone can sell the dogecoin 69 cent pump.
00:44:14.172 - 00:44:44.110, Speaker B: Like top. Actually, only a couple people can sell it. Everyone else has to buy it for that pump to be the top, and then the bottom is the same for that to the bottom. Many people have to sell it. Only a few can buy it. Right. So you want to place up in a position where relatively few people are doing something, and then when you sell, you sell to the many, and then when you find yourself doing things that everyone is doing, uh, know that that has negative alpha because you are likely providing liquidity for someone who did the same thing as you, but just way earlier than you.
00:44:44.110 - 00:45:10.212, Speaker B: Right? So that that few versus many is a thing you have to always think about. Like. Like, great examples. Like, if you buy Ethan in the merge, like, you are now very much part of the many. The people who bought Eth, like, six months before the merge, they're going to sell them to you because they did everything the same as you, except that they did it before you. So you don't want to give that kind of time edge to people. You want to be in the time edge.
00:45:10.212 - 00:45:13.840, Speaker B: You want to be on the razor's blade of the time edge.
00:45:14.500 - 00:45:15.308, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:15.484 - 00:45:18.932, Speaker B: That makes all the difference. Timing is everything. So. Yeah.
00:45:18.956 - 00:45:47.136, Speaker A: And I think we. And I think this is why I think the markets are becoming more efficient, because I think Lido topped two months before Chappella, and I think l two tokens topped l two tokens topped a month or two before EIP 4844. So people buy in anticipation of the event. And if you're buying because, oh, EIP 4844 is happening in two weeks, you know, if you were going to buy my bangs, then you are dexed liquidity. So you do have to predict these narratives and rotations because.
00:45:47.208 - 00:46:12.538, Speaker B: Absolutely. A great analogy to traffic markets is, like, index rebalance, right? So in the early days of index rebalance. So index rebalance is like, you know, S and P 500 or MSCI global or FTSE, where, you know, there's, like, 100 stocks in a basket. Right? And based on some criteria, as companies do, well, they get added to the basket. They get added to the index. When that happens, you know, there's a set, you know, criteria list, some public, some nothing, so that they can't exploit it. Companies can't exploit it.
00:46:12.538 - 00:47:03.356, Speaker B: But basically, you know, they'll, they'll have a announcement and then they'll say, okay, in 60 days, we will add the stock. And then you look at the performance of these stocks going into the, we call it the addition date. So there's like announcement date, audition date, right? And this is one of the biggest stat ARB trades in the world for, for many, many years. It still is, uh, where people are saying, well, how do you trade stocks that are about to go into this big index? Right? And in the early days, like these stocks just all moon into the index, like going to the addition day. And then they moved even after the addition day because now it's like part of the best continuum of flows. Later on, people started to predict what stocks will go into the index, okay? And then the edge started to taper off. And then on the edition date, the price will dump a lot because like that date, everyone wants to sell that date.
00:47:03.356 - 00:47:41.498, Speaker B: So then they sell. And so then banks sort of get smarter and they say, you know what? Im going to actually just try to own the flow. Im going to try to find the flow. So they go to the guys who have to buy the edition date, edition, and they say, how about I guarantee you to sell the edition date price and then they essentially have a guaranteed sell order of the price on that day, and then they then trade it around to buy into it. So then the impacts went even less because, you know, they have the flow. They actually know what they'll do with it. So, for instance, if you, if you buy the entire market's edition day buy flow, then that means that no one will buy it unless you buy it.
00:47:41.498 - 00:48:19.170, Speaker B: Do you see what I mean? Because you guaranteed to sell to them on that print. So in other words, there's, there will be no one in the market buying because they need to. You have controlled all of it. So in that particular case, you know, Mario can actually nuke huge on the addition date, which would be completely fine for your client as well. Who sold you the clue, who wants to buy the print from you at that flow because he gets a lower price. But it completely screws over everyone trying to play the addition game because they're hoping for the buy to come, but it never comes. So I remember there was this Vietnam stock where a bunch of guys who were positioning for a pump on it and it was going limit up like twelve days in a row.
00:48:19.170 - 00:49:16.754, Speaker B: And then what the manager of the fund, of the index fund did was they went to the team, like they went to the founder of the stock and said, how would I just buy it from you at a discount like on some kind of a corporate driven window? So then on that day, there was no buy flow and then it would limit down 20 days in a row after that because everyone is hoping for the buy to come. And not only did it not come, but it was actually the flow had already been cleared. So that is exactly very, very similar to that similar effect in crypto where it's like it used to be that on the Ethereum hard fork day, that is the day you have to sell because Constantinople proved it. A few other folks below proved it because there's no buyer after the fork. Everyone who thinks that the upgrade is bullish has to buy before that happens, thinking that they will sell either that day or after it. So think about what you would have to believe to be a buyer after that day. You'd have to see it pump through.
00:49:16.754 - 00:49:52.824, Speaker B: But then who will buy it? Like you're, like, you're waiting for the pump to then buy because you didn't buy it before, so you must. And then that like, psychology dynamic is everywhere in finance. So now it's like an ultra front running where like you said, two months before or three months before and unlocks a great example where, you know, maybe before they want to see, wait, is this a bullish unlock or not? But now teams are getting smarter. So like, say, is a great example. Wherever they're not even waiting for the unlock, they're just trying to sell ODC, right. And then they're trying to dump it out. So at that point it's like the team can front run their own unlock by trying to sell to people before they unlock.
00:49:52.824 - 00:50:18.046, Speaker B: So there's like a front running of the front running. Um, so yeah, that's actually market getting more efficient, right. Because now you don't need that volatility where of like first it goes up, then it goes down, then it's just like flat. Uh, so, but of course the mechanisms where it does. So it's always intriguing. Like how does it, how, like in, in theory the unlock should, if it's perfectly priced, it should have no impact, right? Cause it's just known. So the price should be completely flat.
00:50:18.046 - 00:50:31.662, Speaker B: Right. In practice, you know, people are like, okay, is it bullish unlock? Or, you know, maybe there's like new money coming in or something or maybe. And then like, oh, shit, it's not. And then it goes down. Um, that actually is pointless. It should just be like this, right?
00:50:31.806 - 00:51:04.566, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, and, yeah, I think last cycle for me, it felt like, it was pretty easy to trade in narratives. You just see something on Twitter in the timeline, it's like, oh, yeah, let me buy that. And it just keeps pumping. Maybe that was the byproduct of just there being so much retail money in crypto. It feels like the capital base in crypto isn't really growing. Even you mentioned earlier, the meme coins. It seems like crypto natives are just bidding these memes, and the average normie doesn't really know anything about it.
00:51:04.566 - 00:51:40.886, Speaker A: And even rollbit, right? You gave that example. That rotation lasted three to six months before it's just retracing. I mean, it's still up a lot, but it really hasn't continued to pump. Like a lot of people may have led you to believe. So, first of all, when, like, how do you predict these narratives ahead of time? I think some people on Twitter have expressed concern around. It seems like a lot of the price discovery is happening in the private markets and not the public markets, and it's really, really hard to trade the liquid markets right now. So how has your views on.
00:51:40.886 - 00:51:46.490, Speaker A: Yeah, like, first of all, like, how do you predict these narratives? And how do you think about liquid versus private?
00:51:47.710 - 00:52:38.122, Speaker B: I mean, predicting narratives, you need to do your research, right? Like, you need to know what people are working on, what kind of narratives have funning behind them, what kind of narratives could make sense and expand the narrative expansion range of things is important. So I think that it's an art, not a science, but I think that. I think a quite obvious one, that a way to think about it is okay as it goes up, will more people believe in it or not? If yes, then that can expand. If not, then not. So I think on the public versus private, I mean, I think public markets are a little overvalued, but I think it's overly stated by VC's. I think the problem is that deal flow is very tight, contested. So what's happening now is also that founders are getting more efficient.
00:52:38.122 - 00:53:03.780, Speaker B: Founders are smarter. Um, you know, last cycle, uh, we, as well as, you know, Alameda and others, we would never negotiate valuation with founders because we. We took the general view that it's all mispriced, actually, because, uh, I. You know, the ftvs were too low. And I think that's been borne out by the results, too. Like, even stuff that, like starcore, like, everyone made fun of. But the FTV still opens much higher than the.
00:53:03.780 - 00:53:28.220, Speaker B: Than the price. Right. So I think that, like, for good deal flow, there's still a lot of opportunities. It's the people who don't have any deal flow now, or it's hard to get listed on exchanges, and then maybe coins get relocked by teams. I think that the pie, the way that the pie is eaten is changing. So I think for 2nd, 3rd year funds, it's not great because they can't get tier one deal flow. Uh, plus, you know, let's say they do ten.
00:53:28.220 - 00:53:47.684, Speaker B: Let's say they make ten bets. Eight don't do that. Well, one does well. But maybe, you know, the exchange requires relocking of investor tokens for another two years, something. Then you're kind of like the last to eat, right? You're kind of the. The passive money bags guy that, you know, the exchange will eat before you, the team will eat before you via their ecosystem allocation. Retail will eat before you.
00:53:47.684 - 00:54:12.340, Speaker B: You're like. You basically have to make sure that it really works to actually finally get to eat. So I think that's why there's a lot of angst on, like, private market valuation. But I think if you just look at the facts, it's still like. And it's a number of games here. Like, one, Athena pays for 100 losses, so maybe 50 losses, so absolute losses. And so it's very not deterministic.
00:54:12.340 - 00:54:32.446, Speaker B: Like, your. Your view on how venture is depends on whether you did five or six deals or not. And that same last cycle, too, right? Because now we only, you know, we see the saloon of axis, but there were lots of layer ones that didn't pump. I mean, I can name at least 15 that you probably haven't heard of that. Uh, or maybe you have, but the audience has not heard of that. We're hyped at some point in 2018, 2019. Like thunder.
00:54:32.446 - 00:54:58.482, Speaker B: I don't know. Like, there's. There's just a lot of these, right? So, um, I actually think for most people, it doesn't make sense to compare public versus private because they don't have. They don't have that as a decision point anyways. I think maybe for some funds, there's that decision point, like liquid funds. But again, it's like, you know, think about icos, think about coin lists, right? The stuff that you could have bought on coin list. Almost all of it did stupidly well.
00:54:58.482 - 00:55:27.398, Speaker B: And the only problem is that the allocation is too small, right. If you bought flow, I think it was like a 500 x. Can't remember. Like, it was a known strategy that you just get all your friends to KYC on pointless and then just buy every launch, right? And Max size, it's free. Money, basically because they're just, they're hoping that is a community distribution. So I think, I don't know if you consider that public or private market, I guess. And maybe that's more like pre, like pre listing kind of dynamic.
00:55:27.398 - 00:56:22.406, Speaker B: But in general, there is a huge alpha in buying before the exchange liquidity because there's a whole set of people who buy new coins when they come out as a pascal's wager. So if you can produce a new coin that can get to the platform that that's on, that'll create that new inflow, same as an index rebalance, they don't care what it is, that they're just like, okay, new coin, I buy it, gamble it, I try it. So that public private gap will always be there because of those flows and also because public people prefer, well, I mean, the private, they prefer, well, they will not. No one likes to like, do a project, do everything, and then like, let's just like price it and design it so that the people who just bought it will lose money. Like, that would never happen, right? Like, so they're going to change all the numbers so that at least investors are up on paper. Then once they're up on paper is the question is can they actually get out? Probably not in many cases. But if they sell SaaS, maybe they can.
00:56:22.406 - 00:56:52.940, Speaker B: If they hedge with perks, maybe they can. So they, you know, the let investors go to the wild and, you know, lead that up to the wins, but they still structurally have an edge because they are in before liquidity event. I think that public markets are, they have good opportunities, but it's, again, it's very extreme distribution. Like many, many alts are now down in the year. Many stuff that was hyped has not gone up at all. So depends on what you're good at, I guess.
00:56:53.770 - 00:57:37.900, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. It definitely feels harder, at least in the public markets. And now I want to pivot the conversation to more psychological because I think you're known for those crypto tweets that is very thought provoking. But I'll first start with this question. I think when I've interviewed people on my channel, a lot of people said that people looked up to you last cycle and because you demonstrated that it is possible to make it like running a fund or starting from a small base capital and just like running it up huge. But I want to, I'm curious, who are your investing heroes? Who have you learned from and what are some, I guess, lessons from the top traders that you took away from and applied to your own trading.
00:57:39.320 - 00:58:42.660, Speaker B: I think Soros is a big one. He emphasized that you have to have a 3d thinking model, like a 3d portfolio, a 3d model of, of how markets are behaving. Uh, and so he talks about how, you know, they'll have a foreign exchange overlay on top of an equities position on top of a commodities position. Um, that was very impactful. And also his thoughts on reflexivity about how many times, uh, you know, nothing is bullish or bearish, but think he makes it so is something that I think is really, really like, like, and then smartest honeydotty, he always talks about how price leads narrative, right? So the notion that like people collectively believe a narrative and then the price moves once they believe it, is completely unfactual, completely fictitious of a concept. It's more that after the price moves, we then search, grasp at narratives to explain it. And that's in the structure of the human mind because the mind is actually incapable of forming a narrative without a stimulus.
00:58:42.660 - 00:59:22.474, Speaker B: Stimulus. We respond, right? So if we see something happen, then we try to explain what happened, try to rationalize that if nothing happened, there's nothing to rationalize. So knowing that there's opportunities to create the narrative, right? So that's why after the eth whales buy the eat, then they say okay, well here's got, here's why you need to buy it. Because the merge is coming, right? And they're like, aha, the merge is coming and then it's pumping into the merge and then after the merge, like, okay, that was cool. So, but crypto's filled with that. Traditional markets filled with that. There are so many examples from 20 1718 where like, you know, like the z cash.
00:59:22.474 - 00:59:53.320, Speaker B: I don't know if you were that around much then, but like, you know, remember there's a zcash fork, there's a high hybrid fork that somebody got him. Rhett, we're basically, he was in an airdrop to bitcoin and Zcashenhe called Z classic. He's gonna fork out the team allocation. But this thing did like this thing did really well up until the day of the thing before the fork. And then on the day of like it just completely died like that. Died about two days like down like 90%. It was very, very high.
00:59:53.320 - 01:00:22.130, Speaker B: So reflexivity matters a lot. Think about how you create that kind of. And that's more from the point of view of like as a creator of narrative, I think, I think another great influence, probably Paul Tudor Jones. Like I watched his trader documentary quite a bit in the early days. That helped a lot. And he has the concept of, like, you have to bring high energy to whatever you do. Like, you have to treat like a sport.
01:00:22.130 - 01:00:43.974, Speaker B: So there was, like, they would show him, like, trading at, like, 03:00 a.m. like, currencies on the phone. They would show him, like, you know, really analyzing the charts very, like, athletically. Like, being like, okay, this, that, this, that. I think that's actually important. So if you're, if you're like, a directional trader, you have to be actually relatively, um, engaged. Right, with your.
01:00:43.974 - 01:01:08.636, Speaker B: So that means, like, trying to stay fit. That means, like, treating it like a sport. That means, you know, uh, being like, a pugnacious person almost. I think that that's required to. So I think, I think those probably my biggest influences. But there's so many. I mean, I've read all the market wizards books, actually, before I started three eras, and that was actually one of my biggest reasons why I started the fund, because I just thought, you know, it's actually not that hard.
01:01:08.636 - 01:01:15.940, Speaker B: You just kind of do it and you see how it goes and you don't know. But if you believe in yourself, market presents infinite opportunities.
01:01:16.060 - 01:01:36.450, Speaker A: So, yeah, you just have to stay in the game. And, yeah, I mean, I read all the market wizards as well, and that's why I started this podcast, because I took, I learned a lot reading those interviews. And I'm like, okay, let me just interview people in crypto that I respect and, you know, see, I mean, and I selfishly do this because I want to learn, and then I might as well just share with the audience as well.
01:01:36.950 - 01:02:40.248, Speaker B: You know, there's actually a guy, there's a guy named Anthony Lewis at Tomasik, and he actually wrote, like, he interviewed myself, SVF, I think CMS holdings, a bunch of other guys. This is, like, early 2021, but he interviewed, like, all the, like, top crypto traders for a while and, like, for like, three, three, four days each. And he wrote this, like, huge text up, but he didn't publish it because then, like, all the, like, a lot, a lot of the, you know, the wizards are not so wizardish, right. But, uh, yeah, you know, like, like, if you, if you have, if you have emotional interest in, like, creating that book, like, you can probably, I can probably connect you and then, like, you, you can get those materials. Because I think that, I think that there is an element of, like, okay, even SPF was like, was criminal and diddly stuff. Was he a market wizard? I think certainly he was a wizard of some kind. Right? And to get that stuff written down and, like, seen and read, if only to be able to identify it happening again next time is very, very cool.
01:02:40.384 - 01:02:51.040, Speaker A: Okay, so while we're on this topic, what do you think are the biggest mistakes that people make in crypto, whether it be psychological risk management? Yeah. Can you just share?
01:02:51.860 - 01:03:14.720, Speaker B: I think they compare too much to other people. I think they benchmark too much to their near peers, and that's a mistake that mid curvers do a lot. So when they're in a certain peer group, they're like, I want to be better than my peer, so I want a girlfriend that's harder than his girlfriend. Maybe I want a car that's better than his car. And I want, like, if he bought eth, I'll buy, like, maybe 1.2 x long so that I make more than him. I mean, you see it now in the Kyle suit battle ball.
01:03:14.720 - 01:04:11.424, Speaker B: Like, it's like he's looking at what I'm doing and then be like, okay, then I need to do something different. Like, actually, he can just trade his own book, right, without caring about what I'm doing, but because he wants to beat me. Or you want to beat, like, your friend now, you're not optimizing your own wealth. You're simply just trying to, like, stay ahead of some curve. And that is, like, really dangerous thinking, actually, because the real goal should be self mastery and mastery of content and mastery of the thing itself for its own sake. And as soon as you evolve toward that mentality, then you unlock true potential, because it could be that your friends are all idiots, so you're gonna, like, outperform them, and you're gonna make, like, $20,000, right. Conversely, like, you could be the best of your group, and then they copy a lot of what you do, but you learn nothing from them because you're just feeling like, you know, I'm the smartest guy here.
01:04:11.424 - 01:04:46.402, Speaker B: Here, I'll teach you about this. But you're not learning anything from them. So a big believer in that. You are the people you talk to in crypto, so make sure that it's as little about wealth flexing and about, like. Like, positions as possible, and more about primitives, more about talking about what is going to, like, what are coins? What are new technologies, what is, like, BRC 20? Like, what is an airdrop? Right? Like, these kind of things will. Will bring you into a much more. I mean, it'll at first feel like it's a waste of time.
01:04:46.402 - 01:05:26.400, Speaker B: It'll be like, you know what coin is? You know, what coin did he buy? At what price can I do it to? But over time, you'll realize that you can reach a level of mastery that allows you to pattern recognize, as you said, and also to understand at a deep level why coins move. I had that tweet, which is alt BTC. I think it might bottom. And then the guy at the conference was like, you're joking. Whales decide what it bought. It's not guys like us. It's something where crypto is powerful in that if you tweet good stuff, like whales will dm you and ask you why you think that.
01:05:26.400 - 01:05:52.824, Speaker B: And so it's kind of like this MMOrpg where, like, you know, like, whales surface and they're like, they'll, they'll message the smaller fish and be like, hey, show me a coin. Or like, tell me why you think, like, the having is going to be bearish or bullish. Like, that is the power of crypto. And then, so make sure that the people you discuss things with are as intellectually honest as possible.
01:05:52.952 - 01:06:15.900, Speaker A: Basically, yeah. I mean, crypto, Twitter, like CT, is very toxic. But I do like the fact that it's more of a meritocracy where it doesn't matter what your background is. As long as you tweet and post good ideas and you do it for long enough time, people will recognize you. How do you utilize crypto Twitter? Do you think it's mostly just noise?
01:06:16.360 - 01:06:58.300, Speaker B: I think it's not that toxic, actually, either. And I think the way to think about it is it's just like a frat, right? It's like a hazing ritual. So you got, like, you know, I think for people from different cultures, or maybe they don't, like, understand Internet culture, they think of it as like, wow, this is like a cesspool of, like, you know, this or that. But I don't think that's true. Like, I think that 95% of people on CT, they're genuinely trying to learn and they're trying to share thoughts. They're trying to show you their bags, but they're also trying to learn which bags to buy. And I think that in almost all cases, like reading CT selectively on something, it will make you a better trader.
01:06:58.300 - 01:07:42.636, Speaker B: The problem comes when people start to use it for, uh, too much socializing and not enough, like, actual knowledge harvesting. I think that when it goes more into socializing, then you have to make sure that you are getting out of it something that is improving your trading and investing. And especially in bear market, this is extremely important because you don't want to be one of the many, right? Like, if you're part of the many instead of the few, then you can just read CTA and get fud out of your bags. You, like, withdraw from Binance, go Max short BNB. And you're like, okay, FTX collapse now, binance. Because that was a common view, by the way, in early 2023. Very, very common.
01:07:42.636 - 01:07:55.960, Speaker B: No one dares talk about it now. People pretend that they didn't have that view or it didn't happen, but, like, it did. It was a thing that happened. And it was mainly a CT narrative, actually, because if you ask normies, I don't know a single normie that thought, binance is going down.
01:07:57.140 - 01:07:57.500, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:07:57.540 - 01:08:15.572, Speaker B: Like, not one, because you just ask him. People like, wherever. Where'd I go? You tell me to go where now? Like, he'll look at you like, you're an idiot. Right? So. So, like, just. It's a good way to, like. A good trick is to ask yourself, what are normies thinking right now? Like, wake up.
01:08:15.572 - 01:08:46.818, Speaker B: Say, like, normilia, what are the normies thinking if that happens? Like, do normies care if the answer is no, then you're. Then you may be in, like, a bit of, like, a whirlpool, like, narrative, right? And sometimes coins. I've seen a lot of coins overly cater to CT at huge detriment when they could have just gone with a more mainstream narrative, like, last cycle. There's coins that went thousand x that you never heard of on a CT. Right? There's coins that did extremely well that very rarely get discussed in that context.
01:08:46.874 - 01:08:47.470, Speaker A: So.
01:08:48.450 - 01:09:21.906, Speaker B: Especially coins on BSc, but coins of many exchanges, really. So there is a possibility of, like, all becoming poor together if you discuss with a lot of people. And then there's a collective desire for poverty that actually happens very frequently on CT. But I think it's a net useful way for you to meet people, for you to build up a brand, build up how you think and share that. All the best ops we got were from Twitter. We basically. I mean, I started from a 800 follower.
01:09:21.906 - 01:09:43.386, Speaker B: I had 800 followers end of 2018. So, um, I remember I went to the hobby event in December 2018. That was right before they shut their office after just. Just having, uh, spent 3 million to renovate it because the bear market. And, uh, I said to the guy, hey, follow my Twitter. I'm trying to build it up. I have 800 followers.
01:09:43.386 - 01:09:49.058, Speaker B: So when we have 800, then each person I met, I was just like, follow my Twitter, because that's, like, one. Like, plus one each time, right?
01:09:49.074 - 01:09:50.070, Speaker A: It's like, yeah.
01:09:50.930 - 01:10:19.270, Speaker B: And these guys just thought I was insane. Like, why are you, like, why are you asking me to follow your Twitter? But, you know, by, I think by mid 2019, I had maybe 6000 followers and that was like eight x growth. And then for a while, there was this meme of, like, will my follower account grow faster or slower than bitcoin? And then at some point, your follower count just like moons, right? Because you're so on and so forth. So I think, put out your true ideas. Grind it. Like, don't, don't, don't treat it as, like, a sprint is a marathon. Life is a marathon.
01:10:19.270 - 01:10:46.750, Speaker B: So, like, what? Like, while it's true that CD is toxic, like, you can also just mute people, right? Like, and don't. Don't block them because maybe one day you want to, like, listen to them, but if you block them, maybe they re block you. They get to dm them. It's like, I made a mistake of blocking too many people at one point. And then when I had to, like, get into gcs, like, group chats on. On Twitter, like, six people have to unblock, reblock, unblock, and it's just a bit of a hassle. So I recommend just muting.
01:10:46.750 - 01:10:53.450, Speaker B: If you don't like someone, just mute them later. If you get added to a chat with them, then you can just unmute. No one ever knows.
01:10:54.870 - 01:11:04.902, Speaker A: Yeah. The next question I have is, what are some biggest misconceptions about the crypto market that you see people talk about? Yeah, biggest misconceptions.
01:11:05.086 - 01:11:39.010, Speaker B: The biggest misconception is that the goal of crypto trading is something other than something other than very doable and very simple. I think that people overcomplicate it a lot and they also try too many different strategies. Find what your edges, find what suits your personality, and just do it. That is how you make a lot of money trying to do what everyone does. Like, in terms of, oh, that guy did this. I wish I did that. That guy, you know, that would never get you anywhere because you don't.
01:11:39.010 - 01:12:01.430, Speaker B: Even if you copy that specific trade, you can't copy the way he thinks about it unless he lets you invest in him or something. So keep it simple. If you're a long cycle trader, you can just, like, trade every month or so, do a rebalance. That's probably enough, you know, and then you'll miss a lot of intermediate moves, but you don't care because that's, you know, that's what you're focused on. So.
01:12:03.250 - 01:12:11.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's the same as he who chases two rabbits, catches none. It's like the master of none. Yeah. Jack of all trades, master of none.
01:12:12.210 - 01:12:13.018, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:12:13.154 - 01:12:45.970, Speaker A: You just have to understand your own personality, right. A lot of people, maybe they're not cut out for altcoins or just certain types of trading, so maybe they're better off airdrop farming or just DC ing, which is not that exciting if you think about the types of trades people flaunt on crypto Twitter. But you just have to be self aware and understand, what is my edge? And what is your edge, do you think? Is it crafting narratives, the balls to go max long? And whether the volatility. What is your edge, do you think?
01:12:47.190 - 01:13:25.182, Speaker B: I think at its core is talent. I think I'm very good at identifying talent. So last cycle, actually, most of the best ideas are not even, let's say, originally my idea. It's just that I hear about it, we discuss it, and then we do it together. That was true for Defi and Arthur Chong, really kind of Arthur Chong and Andrew Kong kind of really brought me into defi with synthetix, and then later on with Wi Fi and with grayscale as well. We were also kind of, you know, we did the trade, like, in the right sizing. But the idea generation comes from other people.
01:13:25.182 - 01:13:56.290, Speaker B: I'm a big believer in young people because I think that, in general, if there's a room of people, the youngest one probably actually is the highest alpha. And that's quite different from, like, in traditional markets, where the oldest guy maybe is the highest alpha. So you want to listen to the elder, and everyone else doesn't speak in crypto. Like, you want to find the youngest guy who's in the game. Be like, what coins are you buying? Like, why are you buying them? What's the narrative? What. What are you watching? Like, that is how you know. And that's same as web two, right? Like, a lot of web two pieces that I speak with, they're like, you know, they'll ask 16 year olds, what are you doing on your phone every day? What are you.
01:13:56.290 - 01:14:23.780, Speaker B: Like, what apps are you watching? And the answers will shock you quite, you know, quite a few times. So I think that's always been my edge. Like, being very open minded, being very willing to listen to all, you know, all forms of knowledge, generally believing in this kind of few versus many. Right? In the beginning, very few people understand, let's say, the chain link, and they'll maybe see a call and be like, this is a scam. And maybe they'll do like a Zeus capital. Here's my short thesis. Right.
01:14:23.780 - 01:15:06.320, Speaker B: But that is where the opportunities are. I think that's something that I've always believed, in part because I think I'm a big believer in the outsider who creates value as opposed to, like, it's made from within consensus and institutions. The average normie, he believes that innovation comes from within institutions or from within the establishment, whereas most crypto people, especially early crypto people, they believe that it's the opposite. They believe that all innovation comes from outside the institutions and eventually becomes institutionalized. Right. So that's been my. Probably my biggest edge, really, just that having that framework of thinking about how money is made, how knowledge transmits through people, across time.
01:15:07.180 - 01:16:04.072, Speaker A: Yeah, I think betting on young people makes sense. I hired someone recently, and he's like, a college student, and I ask him, like, what you're doing? And he's literally running incentivized testnets where he pays like, $10 a month running these nodes. And then he, you know, once in a while he gets, like, a ten k airdrop, and he's like, oh, my God. Like, this is life changing money. So maybe it's the fact that when younger people have less money, so they have a drive to look for these asymmetric opportunities, and then maybe the older people, they don't have that drive anymore, so they're just stuck holding, like, the majors and, like, boomer coins, whereas the younger people, they're always looking for, you know, things outside the box. And, yeah, you have to be open minded because I think, you know, cycle after cycle, I think the second cyclers, the third cyclers, fourth cyclers, they get more jaded and more cynical about the space. But it is that perpetual optimism that allows you to, you know, buy district everyone hates.
01:16:04.072 - 01:16:11.230, Speaker A: But it's like, what if, right? It's like the whole what if meme with Alex Weiss. Like, what if this happens and then just dream bigger?
01:16:11.930 - 01:16:48.268, Speaker B: Also, there's a tendency, especially if you become, like, crypto old money, you become starting to think, like, well, like, whatever was cool in your day, that was, like, the definitive what was, like, going on and everything else now. Like, I don't pay attention. I don't really care. And so, you know, like, I have some friends, like, from the 2013 era, and they're still talking about, like, stuff that happened then. Like, you know, stuff that would, like, there are probably fewer than a thousand people in the world that would understand it, but they, like, still think about that. Stuff like, that is something where no one remembers what happened. 2016 no one.
01:16:48.268 - 01:17:34.036, Speaker B: Like, how many people who bought, who buy Ethereum today even know that it had a, like a hard fork or even know what a hard fork is, actually. Yeah, I would say under 5%. So the, not only is the average iq getting lower, but also the ability to analyze that history is getting lower. So that presents a huge amount of opportunities, actually, because it means that if you're older gen, you have a weakness in the markets, because, for instance, you may think, well, my bags are the best bags. Young people will come, they'll grow up, they'll earn income, and they'll pay me money, they'll pay me rent. I am like the rentier layer. And everyone on the house will have to.
01:17:34.036 - 01:17:43.292, Speaker B: They'll work a thousand years to, you know, let's say we solve longevity. Like, a young boy will work a thousand years to buy one of the coins that I got very early. Right?
01:17:43.436 - 01:17:44.124, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:17:44.212 - 01:18:04.642, Speaker B: And there's a very self serving narrative. It's a very rentier mentality. But in reality, the dude is just going to buy some slot on meme coin and make them, right. He's going to be like, yeah, no, I'll pass. And every cycle, though, this happens. So that's why, you know, last cycle was a very bitcoin, like, maxi cycle in 2019, and then, like, basically the bitcoin Max thing didn't happen at all. Dominance went quite low.
01:18:04.642 - 01:19:01.536, Speaker B: And then this cycle, like, most natives, were very over positioned on ETH and then, like, eth defi, and then that's, like, not happening, right? Not. And then Solana, which is like, became the people's coin after the Alameda dump, then kind of shocked everyone. And, like, given BNB, like, literally no one talks about BNB on CT, but there's, like, 100% yield on out launchpad and on launch pool. And it's, like, very close to all time highs, whereas, like, most coins are not, like, even slot is not as close to all time highs as being as BNB is. So it's just this thing where you have to go and look at what people are actually doing. And the only way to do that without having any framework is ask young people, because they don't have your framework, so they won't see it from that point of view. They won't put it in an analogy or a category, or they'll just say, okay, we're all buying these coins now because of this.
01:19:01.536 - 01:19:31.044, Speaker B: And that's how we're thinking about it. So you get to play the game on its own. I remember in the beginning of Defi somewhere people were like, oh, but this has already been tried before. Like, it won't work. It'll be hacks or, like, there's no volume, like, there's no usability. And I think what they miss is that it's a new game, right? New games. People don't know the rules, so you can't ask the old game players to learn the new game, usually, especially if they have money.
01:19:31.044 - 01:19:34.560, Speaker B: Like, the wealthier they are, the less likely they are to learn new things. Right?
01:19:34.860 - 01:20:22.650, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think in 2020, I think the bitcoin Maxi narrative was, oh, yeah, everyone's going to buy my bags. And now the narrative, I guess last year was, oh, you know, everyone's going to buy my eat bags, but that doesn't happen. And maybe next cycle everyone's going to say they're going to buy my Solana bags, but that's not going to happen. It's really hard to predict these narratives, and narratives happen because no one really expects it. Right? And speaking of narratives, what do you think will be the biggest narratives this cycle? Is it going to be things like, AI can defi bounce back after the whole sec uniswap fiasco? Or is it going to be something totally out of left field that even we're not even aware of? What types of things do you think can bring new games this cycle?
01:20:26.630 - 01:20:44.006, Speaker B: It's a good question. I think. I'm still not convinced on AI. Like, I studied bitten, sir. I think it's okay. I mean, it has community. I have an ex defiance analyst that he's working on it.
01:20:44.006 - 01:21:13.080, Speaker B: Like, he's building a project on it. So I see people building on it. Like, a lot of my friends are tal whales, so I can see that going up and doing well. I think AI is cool, too, because anything can be AI, but at the same time, that's also bearish because it's just very dilution, in fact, like, essentially, let's say you see your AI with your coin doesn't pump, but then AI is pumping, then is it AI? It's like a tree falls in the forest, right? But no one hears it. Yeah. Ultimately. Ultimately, there's no definition of what is an AI coin.
01:21:13.080 - 01:21:59.448, Speaker B: And the AI coins that have been around, let's say there was an AI rally late 2023, right, where, like, you know, fetch and these kind of coins did big moves. I don't think we're going to get that again because you kind of need, like, a cabal, like, rally on these coins to justify that. But I think Tao is an interesting one because it got some hate from an Eric wall type, which is always kind of bullish, because it's a bullish hate into a community. He's the kind of guy who fought hex before the 100 x. Right. He's the kind of guy who would fud link before the hex. So, like, actually, I got interested in top specifically because of the fud, because I was like, okay, this sounds bullish.
01:21:59.448 - 01:22:22.120, Speaker B: It's kind of like when I put it rune, and then in rune went to. Then went to $20. So, yeah, it's a bullish fud. Fud is always bullish, almost. I don't think there's anything I would put my. I would like, you know, say this is gonna be narrative. I think Aux obviously will be a huge narrative this year, because aux ultimately is a.
01:22:22.120 - 01:22:55.934, Speaker B: I mean, it's both, like a social token as well as now we have a product behind it. And also, you know, it's kind of like a. It's kind of like a three AC ether rocks. Think about it that way. It's, like, owned by, like, owned by, like, three AC alliance whales and has had a big flush out from the highs and get some stuff going. I think, like, you want to look for these idiosyncratic coins in general. Stuff that can go 100 x, and people will be like, have to buy after ten x already.
01:22:55.934 - 01:23:35.884, Speaker B: Like, you don't want to buy something where after ten X is, you already know who's going to sell and, like, why they're going to sell. I think that that's been the problem with a lot of CCT coins, because it's like, why is the CDC coin? It's almost like the top. Like, last year, there was a moment in time, like, kind of frozen in time, when, like, every influencer started to show ox, and it was like, basically, as it was going up, people started pretending they owned it and everything. And then that turned out to be the top of ox at eight cent. But, like, I think find something that you really like. I would love to ask you what the next narrative is, actually, because, I mean, you would know. You're younger than me, so you should know.
01:23:35.884 - 01:24:03.912, Speaker B: And I should be asking you, but I. I. Okay, so I think that points trading, like, wallet trading, could be interesting, right? Like, if you can, right now, whales market, you're collateralizing points trading. But what if you can just trade wallets, like, you can. So I have a friend who built that. So you can basically buy and sell the wallet itself. And I think that then you can borrow against the wallet.
01:24:03.912 - 01:24:34.694, Speaker B: So when you. So you could, for instance, farm a bunch of points in a wallet and then you could sell it to build that tech on. On EVM. Not really a narrative, but it's something where I think that enables some interesting behaviors. It could actually bring about the end of the points where I like, I mean, for instance, let's say on a hyper liquid you were licked, but then you have like points still. But you need that. You want that money to be.
01:24:34.694 - 01:24:38.158, Speaker B: To then trade with, but you don't have any collateral to like, short points with.
01:24:38.334 - 01:24:39.050, Speaker A: Right.
01:24:39.430 - 01:24:46.410, Speaker B: There's a way you can transfer that, that kind of tech. That would be really interesting. I don't know.
01:24:51.590 - 01:24:52.302, Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
01:24:52.366 - 01:24:53.370, Speaker B: I'll leave it there.
01:24:53.790 - 01:25:25.376, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really hard, even if you ask me. I don't even know what narrative is. I mean, I think AI, of course, will be a big narrative, but if everyone tries to be an AI coin, then everything is diluted and maybe only a few coins. Pump. I thought real world assets are going to be huge, and we have Larry Fink showing it and whatnot. But I don't think rwas have less of fundamentals. And people really care about the pump of mentals.
01:25:25.568 - 01:26:02.728, Speaker B: Yeah, they have very little pump mentals. And also the yields are too high on non crypto assets versus RWA assets. So I don't know if that's going to work. I do know a project they're doing, decentralized Airbnb. Kind of interesting, where the company has no tokens, but then the hosts and the guests, they farm tokens by renting out their place. So if that gets a lot of people actually, you know, like, ultimately the thesis there is that the host, the super host, especially on Airbnb, they're the ones who actually have the. That have the trust.
01:26:02.728 - 01:26:23.430, Speaker B: Right. Like, if you're. If you're someone who wants to rent to plays, if you know that the guy has a listing on Airbnb as a super host, you don't need to render from Airbnb. You just rented from that guy himself. Right? So that guy were to put his property on like a web3 platform, and then both sides are owning tokens now you're just like saving tons of money, especially even staying for free. Right?
01:26:24.130 - 01:26:24.586, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:26:24.658 - 01:26:26.630, Speaker B: So, you know, stuff like this kind of thing is.
01:26:27.450 - 01:26:47.680, Speaker A: Yeah. What are you talking about? This. I, you know, there's this app called Blackbird. I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's basically a loyalty program for restaurants using crypto tokens. And I've been eating. I've been eating to earn for the past six months. I think I gained a few pounds.
01:26:47.680 - 01:27:14.994, Speaker A: But I think it's kind of interesting where, you know, when it comes to other, like previous loyalty points, they kind of have to give people like cash or like, I guess, rewards upfront. But if you're a crypto company, you can just hand out points and tokens that are illiquid. And then once you're doing so, you get the crypto natives to farm across the board, you onboard more restaurants, and then something that connects the real world to crypto, I guess, consumer apps, I think, for sure.
01:27:15.162 - 01:27:17.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm pretty bullish on raps in general.
01:27:18.090 - 01:27:18.562, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:27:18.626 - 01:27:48.932, Speaker B: Yeah. There's a. Another company I saw where it's. They're going to try to be the crypto.com of this cycle where, you know, the cards are very easy to use, they're usable everywhere, and you can load from a cold storage wallet, which you can't do right now on pretty much any wallet. So, you know, there's reg Arb there that you need to be able to do that. But, you know, people forget like the Monaco token went like 100 x if you had a card and you just like spent money, you got, you made like a million bucks if you got the best card, basically because the coin went up so much.
01:27:48.932 - 01:28:20.610, Speaker B: And that's like, we haven't quite seen that yet where like a b, two c product with a token makes its consumers rich. Yeah, but that will certainly happen. But that will certainly happen. And that's partially, partially why I think it's quite early in cycles, too. I think right now it's still natives playing money games and GBDC and, you know, bitcoin ETF inflows. Like we could very well be in for a very exhausting, like five year cycle where it's just like slower pace on that basis. But see.
01:28:21.390 - 01:28:40.710, Speaker A: Yeah, all right, well, the next question I have is what are some trading and investing rules that you live by where. Yeah, general rules you live by. If you can share your wisdom that you've accumulated in the past, let's say five to ten years, I think our audience would love that.
01:28:41.810 - 01:29:21.378, Speaker B: I think the biggest is to try to ask yourself, why might I be wrong and try to write those down and look at them every day. Halter Jones had a fantastic quote that, you know, I should have done more of and all traders should do more of, which is that every day you mark your book at the last price. You don't, you don't ever. You don't ever think like, oh, I wish I sold higher or wish this or that. You just say, why am I owning it at the today's price, not at yesterday's price and not at the price you bought it, but today's price. Having that humility and that discipline is really important. I think also, you know, being really open minded, stay open minded.
01:29:21.378 - 01:29:43.550, Speaker B: Know that, like, you know, I had the tweet which went viral, which is like, you know, don't focus on the bags that you fumbled in the past. The ones you're fumbling now are just as big, if not bigger. Right? And it's, uh, yeah, every OD will tell you that it's literally true. But then a lot of, like, not, like, just newer people in crypto be like, no, no, I fumbled so hard already, I'll never make it back. And it's like, no, watch as you fumble yet more bags every day.
01:29:43.940 - 01:29:45.828, Speaker A: Right? Yeah.
01:29:45.924 - 01:30:28.408, Speaker B: So, you know, because when you've been around a lot long enough, you would have fumbled like, eth ico, us ico, tron ico, bnb ico. I mean, I can go on. I can list 100 fumbles that you could have made, all of which could have made you, like, eight figures, right? I can name you more fumbles than you probably even know. Trades that could have made money. Like, big money. So that's, like, the thing that, I mean, it requires you to be full time in crypto to be, like, having that perspective. And most people are not full time in crypto, right? So they're gonna be like, you know, if they somehow managed to, let's say, buy Olympus at, like, very, very early days and they follow that, it's gonna feel like, well, I'm never gonna get it again because, like, how did I even manage to do it? Maybe some friend told me, right? But for full time, if you're.
01:30:28.408 - 01:30:49.604, Speaker B: If you can, if you commit to the game, if you commit to crypto, then, yeah, it's like, that is very, very common to, like, there's just so many fumbles, like, we're doing right now. Even, like, you know, just to have, like, a podcast, you're already fumbling.
01:30:49.652 - 01:30:49.948, Speaker A: I know.
01:30:50.004 - 01:31:24.622, Speaker B: Bags, right? That's all. To end it soon, it's just fumble nonstop. But, no, it's like, it's just literally, it's incredibly difficult to overstate how fast moving the market is. I mean, think about bomi, right? Bomi went from zero to, like, listen on binance within, like, a day and a half. So if you were just, like, taking a flight, you like, missed the whole thing. But it's not to make you fumble everything, but it's to make you realize that, like, not to stress too hard over what you fumbled before next time. Kind of a framework to not fumble it.
01:31:24.622 - 01:31:42.960, Speaker B: But, you know, cycles are extremely, extremely powerful at the. At wealth creation and wealth destruction. So respecting that requires basically having that framework of saying, continue to be hungry, continue to learn.
01:31:44.060 - 01:32:00.090, Speaker A: Got it. Just curious, how do you. This is an audience question that I'll just pull up real quick. Do you even use Ta when it comes to trading or, like. Yeah, like, what's your view on Ta? Do you think it's useful? Do you think it's just.
01:32:00.550 - 01:32:20.606, Speaker B: TA is definitely useful. I think order, order, book flow is useful. It is also astrology for men, but astrology is also useful. So I think it's. It's kind of a mix of the. Yeah, it's like the masculine feminine. TA is masculine astrology, you know, but because people all look at it, then they care.
01:32:20.606 - 01:33:00.490, Speaker B: It's like, astrology also works because people will be like, I am this, so I behave like this. So then if everyone believes it, then they will actually start to self fulfill the prophecy, you know? And if you read your astrology, if you read your astrology, like, every week, like, to predict that, then you will actually do the things that it tells you to do. It's all because the line between, like, advice and prediction is a non duality, that there's no difference. Right. If someone gives you advice and they also predict things for you, like, where does the line end? So, same with ta. Like, does the market fall? Ta, does ta work? Like, the market knows what ta is, so ta is a part of the market. Right.
01:33:02.310 - 01:33:15.740, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. Well, anyways, we're, like, an hour and a half in, so thank you so much for your time. You know, we are fumbling bags. Yeah, like, we're fumbling bags right now, but I think our audience will enjoy it.
01:33:16.240 - 01:33:17.400, Speaker B: All good? All good.
01:33:17.560 - 01:33:34.420, Speaker A: Cool. Just to wrap things up, do you have any final words of advice or wisdom that you want to share with our audience? We're all retail trying to make it. Just what advice would you have for the average person out there that's grinding in the trenches?
01:33:35.280 - 01:33:56.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I think join discords, don't join telegrams. Make sure you find smart people to, to talk stuff with. Uh, stay positive. Try to, you know, try to keep your job while you do crypto, if you can. So you can feed that, like, loop. When you have a solid base, then you consider going full time, but don't. Don't, uh, do it too early as well.
01:33:56.658 - 01:33:57.310, Speaker B: So.
01:33:58.210 - 01:34:45.174, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, just one final question. Um, I think this is something a lot of people don't talk about because of, I guess, the masculinity of crypto, which tends to be a lot of, like, male dominated. But I think if you view crypto as a sport, even in sports right now, we have athletes coming out with just being more vulnerable with their mental health problems. Like, Richard, listen, with Brazil and whatnot, like, how do you, you know, manage your mental health? Because I'm sure, you know, you've had wild swings, and it's really, really hard, or it's really easy to be hard on yourself and say, like, you know, like, I. I can't do it again. Or, you know, like, how do you keep your positivity? How do you keep your mental health sharp? Your. Like, your.
01:34:45.174 - 01:34:46.374, Speaker A: Your mental edge?
01:34:46.542 - 01:35:14.860, Speaker B: Um, I think one of the most important. I think one of the most important is to be. Be really grateful for the opportunities you have, right? Like, you. You're in such a rarefied position even to be able to speculate or to be able to trade or invest. So be grateful, like, every day when you look in the morning, be grateful for a lot of things and be genuinely grateful. Not, you know, you may start doing it as an affirmation, but later on you may realize, wait, I am actually genuinely grateful. For instance, you have all your limbs, you have all your eyes, you have your faculties about you, right? That you have an education.
01:35:14.860 - 01:35:39.902, Speaker B: You know, there's. There. There's people in refugee camps that have no food. There's people that have no ability to ever even climb, like, anything. So I think, you know, that's one of those things that, like, you know, chinese parents will tell you when you're a kid, and it's like, you know, finish your rice because. Right, right, in Africa. And you think it's stupid, but actually, you're like, your parents are Lindy.
01:35:39.902 - 01:36:16.344, Speaker B: You should learn that, right? You should learn that, in fact, there are kids with no rice, so eat your rice and be appreciated that you have rice. You know, and that's in the Judeo christian context. It's like, you know, like, you say your grace before you eat a meal, right? And the idea there is that, well, you could not have food, for instance, and then you'd be a lot hungrier. So it's a blessing that you have that. So count. Counting your blessings is really key because that's part of also how you assess your faculties and you assess your. How you might do, you know, a recovery or how you might do something new.
01:36:16.344 - 01:36:57.910, Speaker B: So know that, like, you have free will, basically. And if your life is a movie, or if your life is a. Is a story, know that. Then everything happens for a reason, in the sense that you, for instance, may have done something that's very lucky and good for you now, but that actually is unlucky in the future, whereas something that feels unlucky now can be very lucky in the future. I've witnessed that many times in my own life where, you know, if you don't, you think this is very bad for you. Actually, it's very, very good for you within just a couple years. And something that you think is very good for you is then very, very bad for you.
01:36:57.910 - 01:37:39.860, Speaker B: So, you know, the ability of the human mind to, at any moment, actually know what is good or bad for you is very, very hard to. So having that humility to say, I don't actually even know what is that, good or bad for you at any moment. You have to take that perspective and say, you know, some of the biggest firms are started by people who failed twice. I mean, CZ failed four times before you started binance. So it's something where having that experience and having that always learning mentality can come naturally to you when you start being grateful for what you have. So.
01:37:40.680 - 01:38:07.080, Speaker A: Yeah, and even with, like, the whole market wizards books, most traders interviewed, they just blow up once. You know, they make a bunch of money, they feel they have an ego, then they blow up, and then they hate themselves, but they just keep going. Anyways, thank you, sue, for your time. Yeah, I think our audience will get a lot from this. Awesome. Yeah. Any kind of words.
01:38:08.380 - 01:38:09.572, Speaker B: All good. All good.
01:38:09.756 - 01:38:10.396, Speaker A: All right.
01:38:10.508 - 01:38:11.068, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
01:38:11.084 - 01:38:12.292, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah.
01:38:12.396 - 01:38:13.052, Speaker B: All right, take care.
01:38:13.076 - 01:38:13.300, Speaker A: Thank you.
