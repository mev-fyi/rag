00:00:00.440 - 00:00:42.181, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. Today I'll be going over the farms that I'll be in for the next week or so as well as exploring the farms that I'll be going into in the next couple of weeks. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Alright, so in my most recent video about, you know, the best polygonomatic yield farms for the month of July, I mentioned that I'm just gonna wait for everything to launch and then compare the APRs APYs and then deploy my capital where I see fit. And I mentioned that I'm only going to be participating in safe forms because you know, I'm going on vacation on the third, so I don't want to deal with, I'm going to Hawaii. I don't want to deal with like looking at charts, dealing with impermanent loss, dealing with potential rugs.
00:00:42.181 - 00:01:41.405, Speaker A: So you know, you got to be humble. You can't always go for the best yields. Depending on the life situation that you're in, depending on life events coming up, you can adjust your farming strategy, right? That's part of being a humble yield farmer and that's the main purpose of the channel, remain humble. And so when I made that video I had essentially all my capital deployed in AAVE just for the flexibility of like borrowing against it, providing liquidity and whatnot. But as you can see, I kind of just took off all my bitcoin, all my stable coins and just putting like whatever matic I farmed in here, right? It's not really generating anything but you know, it is what it is. So for my bitcoin I decided to put it curve right in this REM Bitcoin pool generating roughly 2% plus 6 plus 10, so you know, roughly 70% APY. I expect this to go down, right? The base APY and these rewards to go down just because this is such a good form and I expect more and more people to port their funds over to here.
00:01:41.405 - 00:02:16.943, Speaker A: I also think this HR crypto pool is pretty underrated. I mean I feel like people don't like this just because there's impermanent loss risk. I go over this on my June 11th video where I talked about a track crypto. It's essentially so when you're entering a tri crypto you're essentially providing liquidity in three assets like this, right? 30, 33% waiting in each and you are exploiting permanent loss. So let's say if bitcoin goes up 10% and eth goes up 20%. Well then there's 0.28% impermanent loss, which is kind of nothing, right? I mean there's nothing wrong with that.
00:02:16.943 - 00:02:55.259, Speaker A: And when you're earning this much in rewards, then like what's the big deal? So, you know, I think if I wasn't going on vacation I would deploy it here. But just because I just don't want any headaches just because I'm not going to be like interacting with my capital. I'm just going to be humble, remain humble and just put it. It's okay to underperform sometimes, right? So that's where I'm parking my stable coins. And I'll provide a link to, I'll provide a link to this tool in the description below. So where am I putting my stablecoins? Well, I mentioned that, you know, I am excited for Kyber, right? The Rainmaker liquidity mining program. Five and a half million dollars in the next two months.
00:02:55.259 - 00:03:22.983, Speaker A: So the APY should be pretty high. So I was excited for it. But it turns out that, you know, the stablecoin pool, it's yielding 11% and 14% which I mean, obviously that's good, right? I mean compare that to a bank, it's really, really good. But I expected to be higher and there were some UI UX issues. The Kyber team, they're not that good at communicating what the hell is going on. So I don't want to deal with it. So sorry, Kyber, not going to be deployment capital with you.
00:03:22.983 - 00:03:41.935, Speaker A: So I'm just going to stick with DeFi. Right. I participated in round two, round two of yield farming and now this is round three and 45% APR on stablecoins. It's pretty good. And there's other forms as well. There's a bunch of stablecoin farms and you can compare the APRs for USDT. USDT USDC.
00:03:41.935 - 00:04:08.723, Speaker A: You get the point. But you know, I'm totally fine parking it here. People have asked me like, hey, isn't this risky? Like it's, it's not like a blue chip project. Yes, but you know, I've done my research and I have reasons to believe that I think this is safe. But always your own research, right? Like if I, if I get rugged, there's no one else to blame but myself. So you know, I've been farming roughly 270 of this feels pretty good. And you know, at roughly 12, define a day.
00:04:08.723 - 00:04:20.211, Speaker A: I'll go on vacation for five days. So I'll come home like 60 defined tokens. Right. My capital is working for me. You know, it's gonna be, gonna be humble. Stack some coins also. Yeah, I guess that's like a general overview.
00:04:20.211 - 00:04:39.275, Speaker A: Nothing too exciting, nothing's changed. But just updating you guys on what I'm doing. But if you want to, I guess explore more options, then, yeah. Check out my video on the best Polygon and Matic Yield Farms for July 2021. And also Curve is also on Phantom. Right. This is FTM Curve fi.
00:04:39.275 - 00:05:09.899, Speaker A: And these yields are also really good. So for the Bitcoin pair you can earn roughly 28%. And for stablecoins you can earn roughly 25%. And obviously it is a pain in the ass to kind of bridge your funds over to Phantom, but in return, if you're willing to go through those hoops, you can earn Pretty good APYs. Yeah, just, it's hard. I mean, it's just harder to deploy capital on different blockchains because going through bridges, paying gas fees, it's a hassle. But you know, if you already have funds deployed on Phantom, then this is pretty good as well.
00:05:09.899 - 00:05:52.525, Speaker A: So that being said, I'll be in this farm, I'll be in Curve and define for the next week or so, right, Until I get back from vacation. And when I get back, I'll be diversifying my funds from Polygon to most likely Terra, the Terra ecosystem. So on Sunday I'll be releasing a video collab video that it would Terra Bytes. I think they're one of the best YouTube channels covering the Terra ecosystem. And to be Frank, I think Terra has one of the best forms right now. I'm currently not in them just because I just like don't want to enter this new thing while I'm on vacation. But on Anchor, Anchor is like a savings protocol which targets a 20% fixed rate on dollars.
00:05:52.525 - 00:06:30.889, Speaker A: Right now it's at 19.5. It's, it's oscillated between 17 to 22%. But this is really, really good, right? You park your dollars here and earn fees or just earn rewards. And the cool thing about Anchor is that, you know, remember in the month of May, we were all spoiled by AAVE paying us to borrow, essentially paying us to borrow in lend. Right. Well, on Anchor, the same is happening where if you borrow dollars, you'll pay 15% interest rate, but the Anchor protocol will REWARD you with 157% paid in the Anchor token. So if you borrow, you're essentially getting paid to borrow.
00:06:30.889 - 00:06:53.865, Speaker A: Right. With much higher fees, there is risk. Obviously the Thing with Anchor is that right now you can only use Luna as collateral. And the price of Luna is really, really volatile, or it could be volatile. During May, it went from $22 to like $5. So, you know, there is liquidation risk. So you can't be too aggressive in borrowing and lending.
00:06:53.865 - 00:07:44.773, Speaker A: But you know what? I'll definitely be participating in Terror ecosystem in the future. So look out for that video on Sunday as well as Mirror. So I think this is the most extravagant form that I see is, you know, if you don't understand what Mirror is, it's essentially a synthetic asset protocol where, you know, you don't have to be an American to buy like US stocks and whatnot. Right? Because American stocks, I mean, they're one of the best wealth generators in the world, but only Americans have access to it. So these synthetic, I guess synthetic asset protocols like Mirror, they allow people outside of the US in Asia and other countries to gain exposure to the price of these stocks. And as you can see, there's this thing called long and short farming. I'm not going to go over in too much detail because there's a video coming out on Sunday where essentially you can get paid to long and short.
00:07:44.773 - 00:08:38.499, Speaker A: So let's just focus on, let's just focus on Tesla, just because everyone loves Tesla. If you provide liquidity out for Tesla. So let's say, yeah, if you provide liquidity for Tesla, you get 41% paid in transaction fees and in Mirror tokens. But if you short Tesla, you get paid 56%. So what you can do is you can long $1,000 worth of Tesla and short $1,000 worth of Tesla, so that essentially it doesn't matter if the price goes up or down because you know, you're delta neutral, right? Because you're short and long, the same ratio, but you'll be capturing this 41% plus 56%, which is like roughly 97%, which I think is pretty cool. So, you know, video is coming up where we'll go over all the risks and how to do this. But, you know, I think everyone should keep an eye out on other ecosystems.
00:08:38.499 - 00:09:11.811, Speaker A: I know I made a name for myself just going ham on Polygon, but hey, you can't be a polygon maxi. You got to be a yield maxi. Got to go where the yield is. Got to go where the highest yield is on the risk adjusted basis. You can't just go to like a million percent apy because there's so much risk involved. But according to my research, Mirror Anchor Luna, I think is a pretty safe place to park your capital. I know a bunch of funds that are like farming this a crazy amount and I think I'm going to have Do Kwon on on my channel who's the founder of Terra.
00:09:11.811 - 00:09:48.653, Speaker A: So you know I really like what they're doing. I like that Terra there's actually real world use cases for the blockchain, right? Because a bunch of like if you think about Ethereum and Polygon, I guess outside of NFTs it only targets people within the ecosystem. But Terra actually has real world use cases where over two and a half million Koreans are using Terra or is using their stablecoin to I guess transact on their mobile application. So that's a brief overview. Going on vacation. So I'll be more quiet. I have a video, I have a few videos pre recorded where I'll be releasing it to you over time.
00:09:48.653 - 00:10:11.923, Speaker A: But you know, just gotta remain humble and depending on your life situation I guess deploy different strategies. Right? Because that's the point of farming. You know, things come up, life events come up. We can't just be in front of our screens all the time. And in those instances it's okay to go risk off, right? It's okay to underperform. I guess the more djens for a week or so. Thank you guys for watching.
00:10:11.923 - 00:10:14.755, Speaker A: Have a good one and have fun farming.
