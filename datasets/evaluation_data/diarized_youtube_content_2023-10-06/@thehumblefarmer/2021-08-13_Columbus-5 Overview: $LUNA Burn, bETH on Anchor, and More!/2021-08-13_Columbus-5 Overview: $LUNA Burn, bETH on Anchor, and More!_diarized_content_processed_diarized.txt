00:00:00.400 - 00:00:37.137, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. Today I'm very honored to invite two guests onto the show, first being Danku, who I believe has one of the better Terra YouTube channels. All the links will be in the description below. And Joseph. Joseph helped me onboard the Terra ecosystem back in June when I asked the Twitter community to like, hey, are there any Twitter Luna experts? And Joseph kindly helped me out and walked me throughout the entire ecosystem. So I figured I might as well have them on the show to talk about Columbus 5, because I feel like it's something that's overlooked by the wider crypto community. But essentially I think it's as bullish as EIP 1559 for ETH.
00:00:37.137 - 00:00:46.881, Speaker A: So now that I gave the intro, I'll just let Danko take it away from here to talk about Columbus 5 and other exciting things happening in the Terra ecosystem.
00:00:46.913 - 00:01:11.009, Speaker B: So, Danku, yeah, thank you very much for the invitation and congrats to the 50k, man. I think it's a huge milestone for yourself, right? So as you said, right. My name is Danko R. I'm in Germany. I started just recently a YouTube channel about the Terra ecosystem mainly. But it's not only Terra, it's kind of also what you can do all around it. Focusing now more and more on Solana and Polygon and so forth.
00:01:11.009 - 00:01:37.493, Speaker B: And you can find me either you will see it in a moment on YouTube or on Twitter. And my crypto journey began in 2017 when I bought my first bitcoin. But I was young and scared, so I just said, okay, maybe not today. So I sold basically all of this. I just kept a little bit, so I didn't get me any kind of rich. And then in 2020, just when everything started again in Defi, I came back. And then a few months ago, I onboarded on Terra.
00:01:37.493 - 00:01:39.785, Speaker B: And now I'm happy to be here. Thank you for the invitation.
00:01:40.805 - 00:01:43.345, Speaker A: How about you, Joseph? How did you get into Terra?
00:01:43.965 - 00:02:14.295, Speaker C: Yeah, so, hi guys, My name is Joseph. You guys might know me as the Penguin on Twitter. I got into Terra when Mirror first came out, which was around December of last year. At that time, I didn't know too much about. I didn't know about the whole stablecoin model, you know, just thought Mirror was a cool platform, you know, played around with it and from there on out kept on following the whole ecosystem. And of course Anchor came out in March. So I think I was just.
00:02:14.295 - 00:02:34.945, Speaker C: I think I was just. I just thought it was so easy to use, right. Compared to Defi platforms and Ethereum. Is this Easy to use. There were no, I mean there's relatively no like little to no fees right. On Terra, so fell in love with it, started tweeting about it a few months ago and I am where I am today because of that.
00:02:36.245 - 00:02:52.105, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. And I'll have all The Twitter links, YouTube links in the description below, so make sure to follow these two. I think they're one of the best sources for, I guess, Terra news and content. So can you tell me more about Columbus 5? Because that's something I'm really super excited about.
00:02:52.965 - 00:02:55.945, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe you want to give it a go first, Joseph?
00:02:56.565 - 00:04:15.935, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So Columbus 5 is just, this is an upgrade, you know, for the whole Terra ecosystem, similar to how Ethereum has their own EIP 1559, right. This is, you can think of it as Terra's version of a protocol upgrade. Right. So the main things that I think people are most excited about is the simplification of how Luna is being burned, right? So if you are new to the whole Terra ecosystem, they have the Terra ecosystem as this two token system, right? You have your ust, which is a state or Terra stablecoin and then you have your Luna, right? So in the whole Luna community would like to say, oh, burn more Luna. So why are we burning Luna in the first place? All right, we burn Luna because we want to mint UST, right? So when you mint one UST, $1 of Luna gets burned. So in Columbus 4, when this was, when this was happening, right? So basically the senior that is happening from this system is all going into a community pool, which in the beginning or the early stages of the Terra ecosystem, it made sense because he wanted to fill up the community pool to fund projects.
00:04:15.935 - 00:04:57.425, Speaker C: But now throughout the early earlier this year, the community pools is getting overfunded because there's too much USD getting minted. So it didn't really make sense to a point. I think at one point there was a billion dollars in the community pool. Right now in Columbus 5 they're proposing to, instead of those revenue generated going to the community pool is going to be burnt instead, which is similar to EIP 1559 and where the transaction fees gets burned, the seniorage from minting Terra Stable coins get burned. So that is the main and key factor where all the lunatics in the Terra community is excited about.
00:04:58.485 - 00:05:25.565, Speaker B: Yeah, because I think in the end you're introducing like also for Ethereum scarcity, right? It's a deflationary process that has started. And let's see, right, the more UST we need, the probably more the price of Luna will go up because it's getting less and less Luna on the market. So pretty interesting kind of where we're going, right? And we are also having some slides with us where we see that right now it seems that the people are very interested in getting more ust.
00:05:26.025 - 00:06:20.745, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's crazy how like around the same time like EIP 1559, I mean EIP was like 1559 was like I guess being worked on for many years. But the Ethereum developers kind of change the tokenomics to be more bullish. I mean there are other benefits too. But with Columbus 5, I guess whenever Luna is burnt, I guess the senior edge went to the community pool which was being overfunded. So they were like, okay, let's just, just burn all the Luna to make it more scarce. Also this Columbus by making the tokenomics more bullish. And I like the Luna tokenomics too because it's pretty easy to understand where as long as there's demand for USD and as long as more people want ust, the price of USD gets above a dollar and to get it back to a dollar there's a little arbitrage process where Luna gets burnt and Luna, the supply of Luna decreases over time.
00:06:20.745 - 00:06:36.255, Speaker A: As demand for USD goes up, Luna also goes up. Obviously there's other supply and demand mechanics too. But yeah, I think that's one of the most important things I guess for us, for retail investors because I guess that's going to directly affect our wallets.
00:06:37.315 - 00:07:09.743, Speaker B: Fully agree. I mean in the end that's what we all want. Let's be honest, we are all investing in Luna. I think Taiki, you said on your YouTube channel, any way that you're holding Luna, it would be no surprise that Joseph and me are holding Luna. So we want to have more U.S. team and I think that's maybe a good point to talk about the second big piece of Columbus 5, it's the upgrade to Stargate. So for the people that maybe don't know, the Terra blockchain itself is from the Cosmos SDK buildup that's the basis for it itself.
00:07:09.743 - 00:07:50.747, Speaker B: So that's why it's a proof of stake blockchain itself. And the whole Atom and Cosmos ecosystem itself will be connected now to the Terra blockchain over the upgrade to Stargate which is enabling this IBC protocol. And that's in the end just enriching and giving more exposure to the UST itself as stablecoin. Because hopefully everything that we see on the Atom side, Atom Cosmos side will also Then use ust. We have the big dex over there that is called Osmosis that right now has no stablecoin in there. You can just basically use their own coin to trade against the different blockchain that are right now connected. And they're just looking forward to finally get UST over there.
00:07:50.747 - 00:08:18.547, Speaker B: I think this will be a game changer and drive a lot of demand. And nobody wants to say anything that I just keep on because Stargate is so cool because it will also increase the speed of the Terra blockchain. I think it's already fast, but this will make it even faster. We're not talking about Solana speed yet, I think, but it's making it super, super quick.
00:08:18.731 - 00:08:47.457, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean you can go back. So I think there's a second point we didn't hit which was the Luna staking rewards will actually be increased. Right. So if you're familiar with the terror ecosystem and you go on Terra Station, if you swap the UST and Luna, there's. There's two places you can do it, right? There's the terrace Terra swap part, which is. Which is doing it from like amm like similar to swapping from let's say Uniswap or Pancakeswap. Right.
00:08:47.457 - 00:09:10.925, Speaker C: And then there is the on chain swap on Terra Station. So this on chain swap actually generates fees which is currently in Columbus four being burned. But then now instead of being burned, this is going to go straight to the Luna stakers. So this should increase Luna staking rewards by quite a bit. We don't know exactly how much it but I think we'll see in a month.
00:09:12.025 - 00:09:38.597, Speaker B: Yeah, and I mean that's super cool. And I think then the other piece that you see here, I mean we just put up the tweet of Do Kwon itself. Is that a lot of. I mean there is. You always tell me, right? Heiki there is not so much on Terra, right? Do also content about other blockchains because you will run out of content. But with Columbus 5 now, finally we will hopefully onboard a lot of new projects that we also have a look in a second. Right.
00:09:38.597 - 00:10:15.443, Speaker B: Because a lot of people were just holding back to kind of wait for Columbus 5 to go live and that will hopefully get not of new protocols like Mars Protocol that is out there and all the other names starter and so forth. So pretty, pretty wild what probably will come there and then two other things and then we can go into details if you want. Taiki. So there are some kind of side topics I think that are super interesting that are Coincidentally now going live with Columbus 5. Right. There will also be soon ozone going live, which is an insurance protocol. Just a few days ago the wormhole to Solana went live, which I think is super, super bullish.
00:10:15.443 - 00:10:23.755, Speaker B: And then on anchor we will have soon be eth. I don't know. It should be even just live in a few hours. Right. It's not too far away I think Joseph.
00:10:23.795 - 00:10:23.995, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:24.035 - 00:10:25.135, Speaker B: It's super, super.
00:10:25.955 - 00:10:59.959, Speaker C: So for those unfamiliar with Beth, it's basically a wrapped version of Ste and Steth is what is a. It's a liquid staking derivative you get from staking on Lido Finance. Right. So with beth, once you use it as collateral on Anchor, you will then be allowed to borrow UST and you'll get paid for your UST currently because of Anchor borrowers incentives. Right. This is basically they want to pay you to borrow on Anchor. Right.
00:10:59.959 - 00:11:13.675, Speaker C: And then we can get into details of why they're doing that. But basically you get paid to borrow, which you know, it sounds ridiculous if you're talking to any, I don't know anyone. Right. So that should be a pretty interesting development.
00:11:14.055 - 00:11:58.415, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's super bullish for Anchor as well because right now I have Luna bonded on Anchor and I'm borrowing against it. I think I'm being paid like roughly 30% for borrowing USD and I'm sure a bunch of people, myself included, I'm going to I guess bridge over, stake the ether, beat eth, put it into Anchor and just borrow more and get paid to do so. So added functionality is, you know, pretty cool. And yeah, I guess one question I had is that I think on when you stake your Ethereum on Lido, you get roughly 5.5% or 6% of paid in interest. But like do you get interest paid when you put your BE on Anchor or do you don't get paid any staking rewards?
00:11:59.475 - 00:12:03.055, Speaker B: Yes. So the staking rewards stay or. Go ahead Joseph, take it over.
00:12:03.875 - 00:12:34.635, Speaker C: So yeah, I mean once you. So your staking rewards stay when you have Beth, if you don't use it as collateral, it will go to. There's a claim section on Anchor where you can claim it in ust. But then if you use your BETH as collateral, the staking rewards that's being used is used to fund the 20% interest for depositors on Anchor. Right. So that's, that's how anchor generates the 20 interest for, for whoever wants to deposit USD.
00:12:36.375 - 00:13:20.225, Speaker A: Yeah. And in the future there's going to be more I guess staked assets. I think Solana B. Solana is going to come at some point in the other assets as well. So you can already start to see like, you know, Anchor is going to start to build their ecosystem, their project, to, I guess, not only be Luna and be eth, but more assets as well, which is going to be pretty bullish for, I guess, Anchor, right? Because that's going to mean more liquidity coming into the ecosystem. Because I'm sure that there are people who own ETH that want to put it as collateral on Anchor, borrow against it and use the UST on Mirror, Anchor, et cetera. So I think Luna the Terra ecosystem is pretty new because mirror came out December 2020.
00:13:20.225 - 00:13:34.881, Speaker A: Anchor, I think came out like February, March of this year. And I guess in crypto everything like moves so fast. And yeah, I think what they're doing is pretty cool. And obviously like, we're all, we're all bullish. The Luna ecosystem.
00:13:35.073 - 00:14:12.277, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty bullish. I mean, the interesting part is that Luna itself is not that new. Right. So I think that's why it's also working as an ecosystem, having the Chai app in Korea, right, Where you basically can pay in a normal grocery store with your Korean won that are on the blockchain itself. So another stablecoin next to ust. So that's why there is something happening on the chain itself. So right now, I don't know if it changed in the last days, but the Terra Luna ecosystem was also, from the revenue perspective, number three, or usually number four, just Bitcoin and Ethereum are creating more real revenue.
00:14:12.277 - 00:14:18.425, Speaker B: And I think that shows how strong the concept itself is. And I think that's so important.
00:14:19.565 - 00:14:24.025, Speaker A: Can we get into the next slides? Because I think Joseph has some more bullish things to say.
00:14:24.645 - 00:14:25.301, Speaker B: Yes, man.
00:14:25.373 - 00:14:56.067, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically this was a tweet I tweeted out a few days ago. It was just trying to put some perspective into the value accrual mechanism of Luna. Right. So I think a lot of people in Ethereum community are now familiar with burning, right? Because that's a new concept that wasn't a thing until EIP 1559 came live. Right. So I basically did some calculations putting Luna's value accrual mechanism onto ETH.
00:14:56.067 - 00:15:24.985, Speaker C: So I think I calculated there's around $75 billion worth of stable coins on Ethereum. Right? And that's between USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI. Right. So $75 billion. Right. So if, if you burn $75 billion worth of Ethereum, that's, you know, I just did a simple calculation. When I was calculating this, this whole math, there was one price was around 3, 1, I think a price of ETH was around $3,250.
00:15:24.985 - 00:15:47.275, Speaker C: Right. So you just divide that by $75 billion. You had 23 million ETH burn. So keep in mind there's only 117 million ETH out there burning 23 million. That's almost, I don't know, 10 to 15% of the entire supply. Right. So that alone with the updated, with the current market cap and updated supply, I would put eth at around $4,075.
00:15:47.275 - 00:16:19.699, Speaker C: So obviously that's not how Ethereum's value accrual mechanism work. But if you want to put that in perspective and look at Luna now. So if Luna can get to that stage where UST gets to, I don't know, 10, 15, $20 billion worth of market cap, right. You can, you can calculate and see how much Luna will be burned because of that. And then, yeah, that's, that's how people, a lot of people extrapolate the price of Luna to whatever, whatever amount. Right. So it's not, it's not like fantasy numbers.
00:16:19.699 - 00:16:25.435, Speaker C: It's, I think there's some real math and some real, you know, calculations to it.
00:16:25.595 - 00:17:02.135, Speaker A: Yeah. And we have to, we have to be humble here, like this isn't going to happen like anytime soon. I think the market cap of USD is like a little over $2 billion right now, which is pretty good. But I think the most important asset in the Terra ecosystem isn't Luna, but it's ust. And I think I'm generally bearish algo stablecoins. I just don't think they'll work. But if there is a model that would work, I think what Luna is doing, or I guess what Terra is doing, is a good model where you design an entire ecosystem to create demand for ust.
00:17:02.135 - 00:17:35.079, Speaker A: So essentially, if you're bullish on the future utility of ust, which I think the majority of the panel here is, then it makes sense to be bullish Luna. And the cool thing that you can do with your Luna is you can put it as collateral, borrow against it and generate income. Obviously you want to borrow a safe amount so you don't get liquidated. I think that's what happened in May when the price of luna went to 20 to $4. There's a bunch of liquidations. That's always the risk. But I like the tokenomics.
00:17:35.079 - 00:17:46.355, Speaker A: And you can generate yield. Those are two of the, I guess, pillars behind my channel tokenomics. That makes sense. And Generating yield is a cherry on top.
00:17:47.295 - 00:18:07.891, Speaker B: You know what is I think also interesting about ust, there is also a community behind that actively wants to push ust. I think this is not for the other stablecoins. The other stablecoin are just like somebody uses it because. Okay, let me see. Oh, UST is the first one. I just go for it. I just exchange my winnings, yield, whatever, into the next stable coin.
00:18:07.891 - 00:18:51.023, Speaker B: I see maybe DAI is a little bit of a really community behind that. But I think everybody who holds Luna actively of course understands that it's about UST and also about kind of the concept behind that still we need to stand a test of time. As you said, it's a concept that needs to show if it works. But I think everybody who actively kind of tries to understand the system is just super actively on UST and pushing it everywhere out there. I think there is no day in Twitter where I see this kind of people saying, hey, take a look here. People are asking which stablecoin you like? Ust, usdc, dai and I don't know what. And LUNA is missing and then or UST is missing and everybody goes crazy and pushes in so that people start talking about it.
00:18:51.023 - 00:18:58.235, Speaker B: I think this is something that is special for stablecoin that I don't see in others and I think on a long term this will help.
00:19:00.215 - 00:19:00.871, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:19:00.983 - 00:19:09.287, Speaker C: I agree. I think in the next few slides we'll give a bit of insight into what would drive USC demand. Right?
00:19:09.351 - 00:19:21.447, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is just. I mean we touched upon the most topics already in the beginning when we quickly touched upon it. Right. It's just kind of now going through the topics. So Stargate and ibc. I mean if somebody is interested in.
00:19:21.447 - 00:19:38.957, Speaker B: I'm also no coder, but you see here the figures. It's making the blockchain even way quicker. Way more interesting for. And I mean it's appreciated for us. Right. If it's quicker on a long term, usually it's also more efficient, so meaning cheaper so that it's super interesting and good for every blockchain. Right.
00:19:38.957 - 00:20:02.337, Speaker B: As I said, it's probably not Solana speed yet, but it's just part of the game to making it quicker. I would just go over this. I think this is now more important because as said earlier. Right. So we have now IBC enabled. So kind of we're connecting ourselves now to the Cosmos environment that you see right now here in the middle. This is a great picture from Lario X, who is one of the most important guys that you see also on Twitter on the Terra community.
00:20:02.337 - 00:20:47.261, Speaker B: But the other piece that we just introduced or has been introduced a few days ago is the wormhole, right. Which connects now the Terra blockchain to Solana and before that we had already the bridge to Ethereum and to Binance Marching and as said earlier, right. Terra itself will grow and it will be good for the ecosystem if we have exporter to USD if more and more people are using it and the bridges and the wormholes and the IBC and on the other side even now Torchain. But the Bifrost is just enabling UST to reach all those different blockchains and this is just really, really bullish. I would say positive because so many people on Solana are already starting like Mercurial started to have now UST pool. We have Saber with the UST pool and probably more and more protocols are just now introducing USD. So this is super, super positive.
00:20:47.261 - 00:21:03.995, Speaker B: Yes, we have Cardano still there. I agree with you Takei. Right. I'm also positive on them. I think they will probably have a huge bump in the next time if once they enable defi. But yes, it's just a nice take here from Larry putting them on an own independent putting on the island.
00:21:04.815 - 00:21:28.605, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I'm not against Cardano, I think I'm definitely interested but yeah, I don't know who Larry is but I think it's funny that he put like a small jab onto the independent state of Cardano which is disconnected from the entire EVM Union and Cosmos Federation. Yeah, but I'll be talking about Cardano in the future too. Whenever they release my contract.
00:21:28.905 - 00:21:45.289, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they have interest. So I think what is now important for everybody who wants to also maybe do more on Atom in the future with ust. So you see that below the logo of Terra there is this kind of chemical thing there. I don't even know what the name in English is. Sorry, I'm not a native speaker. And that's Osmosis. Right.
00:21:45.289 - 00:22:05.465, Speaker B: And there you will probably be able to see for you interesting for sure. Take a lot of farming opportunities, right? Even now you see on osmosis APRs of 300% it's just average there right now. Of course the downside is you have no stablecoin so it's more risky. But for sure right now farming is super, super interesting on Osmosis.
00:22:07.965 - 00:22:08.865, Speaker C: So that's.
00:22:10.045 - 00:22:30.579, Speaker B: There you go. What do we have new projects? I don't know how much we should spend here. So just maybe quickly me introducing it and then you can take it over from there, Joseph. So the protocols that are live right now, we talked about Touched by Anchor Protocol. You showed it in on your channel several times. Mirror, we have Pylon, right. Which is a launchpad also very interesting.
00:22:30.579 - 00:22:50.165, Speaker B: There will be now new projects also launch tomorrow. Right. Tomorrow we will have Loop Finance, which will go live there. Then we have Loterra. So it's a lottery which went like super crazy last week. It went from 50 cent to $12 and now it's down again to 4. So sorry for everybody who bought the top, but that was really hard.
00:22:50.165 - 00:23:01.461, Speaker B: But I don't know, probably they come back and then terraswap is the last one, the icon there. And Joseph, have fun explaining the amount of stuff that is soon coming now.
00:23:01.573 - 00:23:06.845, Speaker A: I mean, you don't have to explain all of it. Whatever you're. Whatever you're most excited about. Yeah.
00:23:06.885 - 00:23:38.943, Speaker C: So like Danku mentioned, basically there is, I don't know, a line of projects waiting for Columbus 5 to launch. Right. So Columbus 5 itself is really. It's already pretty exciting. But I think what I'm more excited for is all the projects waiting for it to launch. Right. So what you can expect after Columbus 5 is just an inflow of all these projects and they range from, you know, Mars Protocol, which is like a borrowing and lending protocol similar to what you see in ABE or Compound on Ethereum.
00:23:38.943 - 00:24:02.201, Speaker C: And then you have astroport, which is like a decentralized exchange similar to Uniswap. Loop is in the same concept as well. And then there's. There's so many things out there, you know, ranging from launch pads and an Angel Protocol is actually a pretty cool one. It's. It's a. I think it's something that's really unique to the Terra ecosystem because of the yield you can get, a stable yield you can get from Anchor.
00:24:02.201 - 00:24:22.811, Speaker C: They basically is a charity endowment protocol. Right. So basically you can, let's say, put in a hundred dollars into so or so a charity. Right. And then they will use your yield, that is earning from the Anchor protocol to pay out to the charity. So it's basically a perpetual. You're giving forever.
00:24:22.811 - 00:24:35.695, Speaker C: Right. I think their slogans like you give once and you give forever. So that's something that's very unique to the Terra ecosystem that I haven't personally seen elsewhere in crypto. So that's what I'm more excited about.
00:24:36.035 - 00:24:49.127, Speaker B: Yeah. So I personally, I mean, I don't want to piss off anybody else. Right. But I have some favorites. Mars Protocol for sure. Right. So the Ave of Terra Then you have Apollo Dao which is the second icon.
00:24:49.127 - 00:25:07.645, Speaker B: Right. They are yield aggregator that will probably do a lot of interesting thing and then sure. Astro Protocol. Right. This is just probably they say themselves they are a mix out of Uniswap Curve Balancer. Right. So they said that we learn from everybody and now we just coming here with the perfect solution.
00:25:07.645 - 00:25:37.575, Speaker B: So looking forward and SPA protocol right here you can be basically a fund manager for somebody else and earn fees over it. So interesting concept, right. We are getting now fund managers and can show that we can trade or yield farm properly and they can invest in us. So crazy stuff that is just coming there. So the dry powder I have on the side right now just to be prepared is big. I have to hold myself back right now. I hope that they're coming sooner than later on.
00:25:38.435 - 00:25:39.215, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:41.155 - 00:26:08.195, Speaker B: Cool. Then I don't know if we should go now deeper into BE east itself because you mentioned it partly taiki how it's working. And you also Joseph said it's Lido itself where you can stake your eth. I think it's important that it's then locked until East 2.0 finally releases. So you cannot take it back but then you can move it over to the Terra blockchain and then you have Ben can lend again. And what you said earlier is that.
00:26:08.195 - 00:26:56.715, Speaker B: And you see it already in the white paper of Anchor Protocol that there was a clear plan to get more and more proof of stake assets over as collateral. And they said here be Adam B&B SOL and now that we have the wormhole, they immediately said it that BSOL is probably next. So I'm looking forward to probably use my soul that I right now already are using with different liquid staking possibilities like marinade to also put it over to Anchor. It's super bullish, super interesting. And I think also Joseph, I don't know if you want to touch upon this. There were interesting Twitter threads in the last days. The price of Anchor itself is going up again, right? Finally a trend reversal because I think there was a negative buzz around everybody's just dumping it because they don't see value in it.
00:26:56.715 - 00:27:00.415, Speaker B: I think governance is a big value. But Joseph, I don't know if you have a different take.
00:27:01.155 - 00:27:41.219, Speaker C: Yeah, so I mean this is in regards to the Anchor price which has been slowly decreasing since the May crash. Right. I think at the start when Anchor first launched the price of ANC token, which is the token for Anchor, I think got pumped up to I want to say as high as $7. And then it's been a slow decline. Now it's around, I want to say two dollars and a half. Right. So obviously the price moved a bit because of the news of BE coming live, but I'm personally pretty bullish on anchor as a protocol because, you know, the possibilities of what Anchor can do is amazing.
00:27:41.219 - 00:28:05.983, Speaker C: Right. As a savings protocol. You know a lot of those protocols we Talked about on Columbus 5, they're built on top of Anchor, right. They use Anchor's 20% yield. So it's not. So all those people that are using those protocols, all their ust being deposited into those protocols will be deposited into anchor. So I think the amount of value that is going to be on ANCHOR is going to be tremendous.
00:28:05.983 - 00:28:29.309, Speaker C: I honestly think they have the possibility to be a top five DeFi protocol in the next few months. Right. Because of B Ethereum and all the other B assets coming out. Right. So I think once ANC can fix their tokenomics and capture that value, I think the potential for where ANC can go is honestly, I don't know. I can't imagine it as of now.
00:28:29.357 - 00:29:15.165, Speaker A: But it'll be exciting even if you're not even. Because I have mixed feelings about governance tokens. Like I, I can, I'd rather hold something like Luna with where the tokenomics makes more sense than governance tokens because it's, it's hard to know where the value is coming from. So me personally, I feel like I'm gonna like dump half my anchor into Luna and like hold like hold the other half as a moonbag. But hey, like you know, like farming on anchor like this, barring against whatever like be Ether Be Luna is a way to like earn free Anchor. So I'm just like putting the farmer hat on. Definitely this is something, an asset that I'm willing to form to speculate on the future price.
00:29:15.165 - 00:29:33.287, Speaker A: But I guess to be honest, I'm not like I'm neutral on the anchor token. But I mean it's great. I mean right now it says like the total deposit is 900 million, but is that the total value locked in Anchor or is that just ust?
00:29:33.481 - 00:29:34.707, Speaker B: That's just ust.
00:29:34.851 - 00:29:35.475, Speaker A: Okay, okay.
00:29:35.555 - 00:29:36.251, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:36.443 - 00:29:41.539, Speaker A: But if you count B Luna, do you know how much is locked in Tinker? I heard it's in the billions or.
00:29:41.547 - 00:29:46.375, Speaker B: A few billion two point something right now, which is already.
00:29:46.915 - 00:29:49.135, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. This is before be.
00:29:49.555 - 00:30:04.215, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think BE is going to be huge because I'm sure there's a bunch of people that like hold eth and now there's a reason for like I guess put their funds over to their ecosystem.
00:30:05.395 - 00:30:46.701, Speaker B: You know what I would like to add there, I agree with you. Usually governance tokens are a big question mark, right? And as a farmer, you're usually saying you're a humble and honest farmer. You're saying, hey, I'm doing this to make money, so it's totally fine. I think the kind of small caveat you have with ANCHOR is that we don't have an infinite supply, like be it pancakeswap or whatever, right? So in four years it's over for anchor. And I mean you cannot take it from two perspective. First of all, just a farmer perspective, I don't care, right? Four years, it's four years. But I think from a community perspective, as Joseph also said, almost every protocol is coming is based on ANCHOR protocol on a 20% yield, right.
00:30:46.701 - 00:31:16.213, Speaker B: Whichever way it is right now, scooping up all the Anchor that is so cheap in four years when there is no distribution of ANCHOR anymore, he will basically decide about the future of the Luna Terra Luna ecosystem. Right? Because if he then says anchor, yeah, 2% from now on, I don't care. Right. I do the decisions here. That's why I took it as a community member and being bullish on the ecosystem and want to see it thrive positively. I see personally value in anchor. Right? But as I said, I'm also a farmer like you.
00:31:16.213 - 00:31:40.057, Speaker B: I also want to make money. So selling is nothing bad itself, right? Yeah, that's from their perspective. But yeah. So I don't know Joseph, if you want to quickly touch upon. So the news in the last days have been like crazy, right? Columbus 5 and then you go to the toilet for five minutes, you come back, you open Twitter again. It's kind of what happened, what happened. Right.
00:31:40.057 - 00:31:44.225, Speaker B: So Travala and Coinbase, I don't know if you want to touch upon them quickly. Yeah.
00:31:44.265 - 00:32:27.075, Speaker C: So I think this past week we've been spoiled as lunatics, right? So Travala is one of the biggest travel, I think agency booking site, right. They, they basically just enabled UST to, they said 3 million of their travel products or 3 million travel products right across the world. So I don't know if you want to go anywhere in the world, you can use us to book your flights with that. So I think that just goes along the line of trying to gain, we're trying to gain mass adoption for ust, right. So we're not trying to sell USC back into fiat, we're just trying to use usc. So if you think about that and how powerful that Will be. Luna will be in a good position.
00:32:27.075 - 00:33:12.341, Speaker C: And then Coinbase Pro, USC being listed on Coinbase Pro. I think that was a bit of a surprise for everyone because considering where the Stablecoin regulation was, but I think because Coinbase just listed them, I think there's a big relief from everyone because like I said, right, UST is the algorithmic Stablecoin and for them to pass, or for UST to pass the regulations team on Coinbase and to list them, I think that's a big deal that should not be understated. So that obviously will bring another. I don't know, I think coinbase has what, 60 million users and they will have exposure to UST now. So I think USC is in a good place. Yeah.
00:33:12.373 - 00:33:52.463, Speaker A: And I think Wrapped. Yeah, I think yesterday wrapped. Luna was also going to be listed on Coinbase too, which, you know, is, I guess. Yeah, like 60 million users now can buy Luna without having to pay ridiculous gas fees. Speaking of which, like, can you briefly go over bridging for my audience? Because right now, or the way I did it is I had to go through Ethereum, the Ethereum blockchain, and I did have to pay some gas fees, which kind of sucks, but it is what it is. But if you can go through different ways to get UST or Luna onto the Terra ecosystem, that would be really valuable for everyone.
00:33:52.639 - 00:34:19.467, Speaker B: Yeah. So for those of you viewers who maybe seen already stuff from me, everybody knows a video with me without a flowchart would not be a video. So I've brought with me a flowchart to trying to understand different ways. And I think there are. I mean, there are many ways. But also I like to go for the cheapest way because we don't want to get wrecked with the gas fees. So where you hold UST usually is on the Terra station, Right.
00:34:19.467 - 00:34:49.801, Speaker B: You can download it. There is also a Chrome extension and I think important for yourself. And that's what you mentioned, Joseph, also with the seniorage that is right now burned. So usually you can hear. Also you see you have a swap feature here. So if you have Luna, you can swap it either on the market or on chain and then you get ust and then there are a few ways. So I think right now one of the easiest way is if you go on the anchor page right now, you will see that they added like a small icon where you can now buy immediately and then they put you on transact.
00:34:49.801 - 00:35:13.725, Speaker B: Right. This is a Fiat on ramp. I used it myself now for the last week. You can usually expect like 0.5 up to 1% fee depending how much you are putting in there. The more you're putting in there, the less is the fee, right? I think I moved last week like 10k over there and it was 0.5% in a fee as a whole, right? And then of course you have the slippage thing.
00:35:13.725 - 00:35:52.831, Speaker B: I'm from Europe, so I'm also exchanged, so you need to just check it out for yourself. But it's cool because it puts it immediately on the chain and you have it in your wallet, right? So this is something very positive and it works and it's quick. So my average time was 12 hours that it took them from me putting the funds down, not with a credit card, with my normal bank account. So in Europe it's Zepa works another way is you can use sure exchanges. I myself in Europe it's very easy to use Binance. On Binance you cannot get UST right now. But on Coinbase we've seen it, right? You can right now get wrapped USD and also on Kucoin.
00:35:52.831 - 00:36:35.619, Speaker B: But correct me, Joseph, right? Both versions they still need to be bridged, which is again fees, right? So that's why it's not that cheap. I think a cheaper version is you just buy Luna. Either you have another asset like USDT that you want to get rid of or USDC you want to get rid of, right? And then you buy your Luna, you then send it to your wallet, which is basically just a few cents and then you swap it over here. I think this is one of the cheapest way, right? Buy it on exchange Luna, send it to your account and that's fine. If you have. If you don't want to use a centralized exchange, which I understand, right, you could have certain concerns there. You can either go on Uniswap or on pancakeswap and swap your whatever assets to wrapped ust.
00:36:35.619 - 00:37:24.191, Speaker B: Now Uniswap again, gas fees expensive, but Pancakeswap cheap, right? It's on Binance Smart chain. Of course you need to decide yourself if you want to use that, but I used it myself several times just the benefit of cheap fees. So I have usually I even buy Luna on Binance or Busd on Binance. I put it on my wallet on the bsc, then I go to Pancakeswap, swap it and then you need to go to the Terra bridge and then you have the bridge either from Ethereum or Binance marching. That's why I put here both opportunities and there you can bridge your wrapped UST to normal native ust and then it's also appearing on your blockchain, on the Terra blockchain and on the wallet. And if you do it on Binance Smart chain, we are talking about a few cents, right? It's super, super cheap. I did the math once.
00:37:24.191 - 00:37:45.379, Speaker B: I mean, I didn't even reach a dollar. If you go backwards from Terra to Ethereum or to Pancakeswap. Right? Or Unix for whatever it is there, you need to pay a little bit more. Right? There's an extra gas fee that is put on top of that. But who wants to bridge their ust outright? Nobody. We just stay in here. No, so just kidding.
00:37:45.379 - 00:38:09.535, Speaker B: I mean, those are three ways. So I just put here now also. And of where do you need to put your money in? So either on Binance or another exchange, right? I'm not paid by Binance. Buy Luna, put it into your wallet. You have another asset on a dex, then you can swap it to wrap ust, bridge it and bring it to your wallet. Or Transact if fiat on ramp works pretty good, super quick. And you put it into your wallet three ways.
00:38:11.405 - 00:38:31.221, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think so. This is really useful. Me personally, like, I used Polygon to like swap ust. You can use it, you can swap on the Define exchange, but there's not that much liquidity there. So I did have to pay some slippage and you paid it like the swap fees. So I think in the future I might just use Transact. I might have to pay like 0.5
00:38:31.221 - 00:38:41.321, Speaker A: or 1%, but it'll save me from the struggle. And like all the swap fees and slippage I'll have to go through. But yeah, I mean, which one did you use to.
00:38:41.393 - 00:38:43.561, Speaker B: Or which bridge did you use from Polygon then?
00:38:43.713 - 00:39:18.315, Speaker A: I just used a. I used the main Matic bridge ust and then ust to. Sorry, Polygon to East and east to Terra. And I had, yeah, I had to pay some gas fees. But, you know, it was worth it because, like, now I'm earning lots of yield on Anchor Mirror and like my Luna went up. So. Yeah, yeah, it's crazy because, I mean, I don't know if people front ran the Columbus 5 upgrade or Insiders knew about the coinbase listing, but the price of Luna has been pretty insane.
00:39:18.315 - 00:40:05.175, Speaker A: I think it's one of the few altcoins that hasn't underperformed Bitcoin since May, which I think is. That's a feat. So, I mean, yeah, I think we're all bullish, Luna. And yeah, I think at the end of the day it's like Luna isn't the most important asset, it's ust. And if you think about it that way, then the community also is pushing for UST utility across all blockchains. And I think that's the biggest metric to watch. If you're bullish Luna, it's like, where are, where's the utility of USD and is the market cap USD growing? Because if it is, then with Columbus 5 a lot of Luna is going to be burnt.
00:40:05.175 - 00:40:13.375, Speaker A: Do you have any other thoughts on, I guess, the future of Terra and where you see it in maybe six months to a year?
00:40:14.915 - 00:40:16.483, Speaker B: Joseph, you want to go first?
00:40:16.659 - 00:41:12.301, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, I like to say this often, right. I don't think we can imagine how big it will get. Like we just don't have the capabilities. Right? So for example, if you ask someone in the Ethereum community, back in 2017 when Ethereum was like under $100, right. Would you have imagined Ethereum to be where it is today with all these blossoming DeFi applications NFTs then, now Ethereum is what, $3,000? You cannot have imagined that, right? So in the same lens or same perspective, I would like to look at Terra Luna in that way, right? Like I know there's projects dropping after Columbus 5. Like I know that's for sure happening, but after that, the after effects of what applications are built on top of that, you know, and then what other applications or decentralized applications will be built on that, you know, that's something I just cannot comprehend.
00:41:12.301 - 00:41:15.505, Speaker C: So I'm just here along for the ride.
00:41:16.775 - 00:42:00.873, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, first of all, before I forgot because I think I have mentioned before and I see it right now here with those tweets, right? Congratulations also to the team and to all the core development team. Right. Those guys are just. If you say earlier, right, Joseph, when we were coming into the call that I'm not sleeping to cover everything that is possible, I think those guys are never sleeping. They post around the clock at Twitter developing stuff that's just crazy and something that I think we haven't touched upon yet here because it's not really part of this whole Columbus 5 and the side effects is UST, as you also said, it is basically the more demand we have, the better it is for the ecosystem and for Luna. And it's about the mainstream we are right now. We touched upon everything in Defi and on the chain.
00:42:00.873 - 00:42:44.239, Speaker B: But I think most importantly is that we get UST into the real world like Travala is right now doing. And for that, as said, it all started with Chai in Korea and there right now more and more third party apps coming to use a UST to just use it in your normal life like Alice is probably coming soon. We have cash IO which is coming soon. I hope that also they don't forget about Europe because I also want to pay with my in the future oit. Right. So the European so the euro stable coin. So once this gets started, I mean there's just a natural demand hopefully, right? I look forward to get my, my bread, my water, whatever with UST or whatever it will be in a grocery store and I think this is really the game changer.
00:42:44.239 - 00:43:19.315, Speaker B: Defi is interesting but I think there is a limit naturally to it. I think we see it with all the big Ethereum protocols. It seems like they blast it off but right now they're capping a little bit out. I think probably the same will happen to Terra, but the mainstream will I think not cap out if they start really using UST or whichever stablecoin they need, be it the pound, the euro, the Australian dollar, the yuan. That's really the big part where I agree with Dole then Moon, then Moon for sure.
00:43:20.215 - 00:43:54.765, Speaker A: Well, this has been a great conversation and thank you for coming onto the channel to explain Columbus 5 and the things coming up and especially the bridging part too. I think that's going to be really useful. So I'll make sure to have the Twitter links for Joseph and Donku in the description below, so make sure to follow them. The Luna community is pretty strong, so if you follow them you'll be I guess, exposed to a bunch of other lunatics that will be more than open to I guess get everyone throughout to understand Luna. So thank you guys for watching. Have a nice day and have fun out there.
