00:00:00.880 - 00:00:21.574, Speaker A: What's up, guys? Taiki here. And today I want to discuss the curve exploit and the implications for the broader markets and what I think happens to everything. So let's get right into it. Nice financial advice. So, there was a curve exploit a couple days ago where roughly $28 million, $27 million were exploited in either for these protocols. And this was something called a reentrancy attack. And you feel free to look this up in your own time.
00:00:21.574 - 00:01:06.108, Speaker A: It's gonna get too long if I talk about this, but this is a pretty common attack vector for smart contracts, and unfortunately, this wasn't really a bug in the curb smart contract. It was a bug on Viper, which is another smart contract programming language. Most deFi applications use solidity, and it seems like solidity contracts is fine. It's mostly contained within Viper, and I think most. Yeah, very, very few protocols use viber. But I guess it's a reality check that there could be bad code, and even if the founder and the team does everything correct, and there's external factors that teams have to be aware of. And also the curve ETH pool on chain was also drained, roughly 32 million CRB.
00:01:06.108 - 00:01:31.000, Speaker A: So CRB is very, very illiquid on chain, which causes a lot of problems when it comes to potential liquidations. So let's talk about that. If you've been keeping track of DeFi, you probably know about Michael Igorov, the core founder. His on chain position. He has $190 million worth of value. But this isn't really real value, right. That could be realized because most of his position is using CRV as collateral and then borrowing stable coins against it.
00:01:31.000 - 00:01:32.276, Speaker A: In this case.
00:01:32.308 - 00:01:32.476, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:32.508 - 00:02:01.532, Speaker A: He has $150 million with the CRB, borrowing $54 million of USDT. Is it actual $150 million worth of value? Definitely not. If he had to liquidate his position today, he maybe gets, like, 1020, $30 million with the value. That could be argued, but it's a very illiquid position. Advocate Avra. There's roughly $26 million here with $12 million worth of dollars stablecoins borrowed. Fraxland is a position here.
00:02:01.556 - 00:02:01.740, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:01.780 - 00:02:18.868, Speaker A: $22 million. And then, you know, you kind of get the idea. So the way he's, like, financed his, like, mansions and whatnot, and this is, like, the part that gets people angry. It's like, oh, my God. Like, he just took his illiquid altcoin, borrowed against it, and, like, bought mansions, and now that his price is going down, he's going to get liquidated, which is understandable.
00:02:18.924 - 00:02:19.476, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:19.628 - 00:03:10.138, Speaker A: But I'll try to reserve my thoughts on here on, like, this topic right now, and I'll try to talk more about, like, the risks to the rest of the markets. So, like, why wasn't this addressed? Like, why did Aave and, like, all these money markets allow this to happen? This has been, like, a pretty hot topic for quite some time now. And then in June 18, there was actually, like, this proposal from, like, a risk management company called Gauntlet said, okay, like, no, like, this is dangerous. Let's try to free CRV and not allow any more borrowers against it. And this was actually denied by governance. And, you know, like, this character called decent muse, he was like, okay, like, what the hell is this? Right? Like, this doesn't. I guess this is, like, a way for the CRB founder to sell indirectly and not angry the community, right? Because if whenever a founder sells their tokens, people get angry, right? It's like, oh, my God, like, you're dumping on us.
00:03:10.138 - 00:04:10.816, Speaker A: And maybe it's, like, also tax optimized, but, like, does he really have intentions to actually, like, you know, pay back his debt? Because, of course, if the CRB price doesn't go down, like, this is perfect, right? Like, no one's angry, but as soon as it goes down due to, like, an exploit, then it kind of poses threats to the prices, CRV. And also, like, these money markets. And then Mark Zeller, who's part of the Avi chan initiative, talked about, okay, like, well, I mean, yeah, like, I'm not gonna redo this, but basically, like, you know, the governance proposal did not pass. Maybe this, like, highlights, like, a flaw in, like, governance proposals where maybe AV and CRV communities are, like, too friendly, and they didn't really take this seriously. And I do think that they were gonna resolve this somehow, but unfortunately, like, the exploit happened, and now we have to deal with it. Now, like, what does it actually mean? Right? And I think this became a big issue because of this protocol designed by Fraxland. Because if you think about how Aviv two works, anyone can use any collateral and borrow against it, right? It's cross collateralized.
00:04:10.816 - 00:04:19.352, Speaker A: So, you know, like, Michael, right, he's using CRB's collateral, but he pays the same borrow interest rates for tether as you and I.
00:04:19.376 - 00:04:19.824, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:19.952 - 00:04:43.692, Speaker A: Which doesn't make any sense, because if he's borrowing CRB, then technically, like, his position is higher risk. So the bank should hire. Sorry. The bank should charge a higher interest rate, but that's not really how it works. And this kind of, like, highlights a flaw here. And, you know, Fraxeland kind of improves on that. So let's talk about Fraxeland and this kind of, you know, kickstarted, like, the whole fear in the markets.
00:04:43.692 - 00:05:16.938, Speaker A: And there's nothing wrong with Fraxeland. In fact, they have a very, very sound protocol design, and they have these isolated money markets, right? So, you know, like, if you're lending on, like, Fraxland, right, which is the money market for, like, EtH pool, even if there's, like, bad debt in the servi pool, like, you're not, like, your position is not going to be at risk. Whereas for Aave, if you're lending USDT and Michael can't repay his loan, then there's a chance that you won't be able to pull out your stable coin. And for the CRV market, for Fraxland, the half life is 12 hours, meaning that if the utilization rate is 100%, that the borrow rate is going to.
00:05:16.954 - 00:05:18.462, Speaker B: Double every 12 hours.
00:05:18.586 - 00:05:38.046, Speaker A: So the utilization rate basically means that, you know, every fracs that's lend lent into the protocol is being borrowed by the borrower. And if that's going to be the case for 12 hours, then the borrow rate is going to double, which, of course, has. It was happening a few days ago because, like, who the hell wants to lend out, you know, fracs to, like.
00:05:38.078 - 00:05:39.086, Speaker B: This particular lender, right?
00:05:39.118 - 00:06:17.570, Speaker A: Because he sounds like he's going to default. And, you know, if you do the math here, after four days, the interest rate was going to be like 10,000%. So, like, no matter the price of CRV, even if it's, like, flat, this position wasn't going to. Was going to get liquidated. So this kind of forced Michael's hand and he had to liquidate his vision, and there was fear in the markets because if he wasn't able to refinance his loan, I suppose, then there was going to be some liquidation, cascading liquidations. It was a ticking time bomb, because if he didn't repay in a few days, it was going to be liquidated. And what's going to happen when there's $2 million with a CRV liquidity on chain and there needs to be this much CRV sold in stock markets? It doesn't happen.
00:06:17.570 - 00:06:33.984, Speaker A: So in that scenario, in the worst case scenario, Aave holders and USDT lenders on AAve are going to be left holding this bag because the liquidator can't liquidate this position. Fortunately, Michael was able to kick the can down the road. He sold some curve OTC to these players, $0.40.
00:06:34.032 - 00:06:34.216, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:34.248 - 00:07:04.268, Speaker A: OTC handshake agreement, three to six month lockup. If the CRV price rises to $0.80 then they can sell. So it's a handshake agreement. There's no smart contract enforcing this lockup. They're just saying, okay, please buy my token and like don't sell basically. Right, and also right, like these backers also don't really give us a vote of confidence because ideally, right, maybe he's able to like raise money from other founders like Stani from Ave came from SODX or something or like VC's.
00:07:04.268 - 00:08:10.386, Speaker A: But like he's like lending, he's like borrowing or he sold like money CRV to like Machu big brother, right? And like cream finance, right? It's like these really aren't like the figures that you want like you want aligned for like your long, like if you're like a CRV holder. So it kind of shows that he was kind of desperate and you know like every single day there's like new like, like OTC deals being announced. But if you think about it, right, it's like very PvP and it's like very manipulative because if you're like for example a Machi big brother or you know, you have some inside information that there's going to be some OTC deal happening and you know that the entire market is shorting CRVD. You can literally participate in the round and just super long leverage long CRV on purpose on a centralized exchange and then profit when those shorts get squeezed. And then after that happens maybe these people can short CRB after the pump and then hedge this three to six month lockup. These holders, they're looking to profit and they're not necessarily super aligned. I'm not generalizing all of them, but on average more OTC deals get announced.
00:08:10.386 - 00:08:47.426, Speaker A: I would expect that like that's happening right behind the scenes. And then I guess like you know with the OTCdo the Fraxland situation was resolved, right? So as long as CRB doesn't really like nuked like $0.30 or something, right. His Aussie position is not going to get liquidated however, right? Like these money markets, they're not going to stand around and do nothing. Avrocadabra just introduced this governance proposal that's live right now to change like the interest rate adjustments for like the CRV market. So TLDR, right, it pushes the base interest rates to borrow mim the stable coin to 200%. And as the price of CRB falls it kind of like just like supercharges like, the interest rate.
00:08:47.426 - 00:09:25.760, Speaker A: So it's like, similar to, like, the fraxon situation. Even if the CRB price doesn't go down that much, the position can get liquidated. And it kind of accelerates the timeline for, like, Michael to just raise up capital elsewhere, which is kind of dangerous. I mean, there's, like, moral issues around this, right? It's like, oh, like, Fraxelande was designed like this beforehand, and now, like, abracadabra is gonna, like, like, do this via governance. But I mean, I totally understand, like, where the money markets, like, like, their perspective rates. Like. Like, why would, like, if I'm, like, the founder or if I'm, like, the lead dev for Abracadabra, like, why would I just, like, let this thing, like, just, like.
00:09:25.760 - 00:10:03.614, Speaker A: Like, blow up, right? Like, I'm gonna be the one, like, the first one to, like, raise interest rates to force Michael to pay off that loan, right? So that there's, like, no bad debt. And this is kind of equivalent to, like, on chain loan sharks, right? Like, if you, like, borrow money from the mafia and you don't repay, like, they come to your house and they, like, beat you up, right? It's. It's kind of like the equivalent, right? Except it's via smart contracts and, like, boosting, like, interest rates. And, you know, it's. Yeah, it's like a very PvP. Like, there could be, like, some cooperation happening here, right? Like, if all the lending protocols agree to not, like, do this, then it gives Michael time. And, you know, maybe he can liquidate his mansion.
00:10:03.614 - 00:10:49.704, Speaker A: Maybe he can, you know, like, he can sell his angel investing tokens and, like, equity OTC or something, like, slowly, like, drum up liquidity. But, you know, like, what Michael needs is time, right? If he has time, he can probably, like, save this cascading. Cascading liquidation from happening. But if all these money markets try to, like, like, turbo boost, like, the interest rates, then, like, the entire system is at risk and someone is gonna be left holding the bag, right? So, yeah, on chain loan sharks, I mean, it makes sense, right? I don't think we should be blaming Abracadabra by any means. So I guess let's talk about the bad debt, right? So, like, negative externalities for the rest of defi. So this is the obvious position, right? He has this much crb. He borrowed $54 million.
00:10:49.704 - 00:11:56.116, Speaker A: But of course, right? Like, if the market try to sell this, then, like, how much actual dollars can be salvaged? I'm not quite sure. And look, this is not gonna happen, right? This is very, very unlikely. But let's do, like, a simple experiment, thought experiment, so you can understand, like, the depth and, like, the risks to the Aave protocol. So if CRV can be efficiently sold for $30 million, which is, like, 80% haircut, which I think is kind of reasonable. Like, I'm not even sure, like, yeah, I mean, you can, like, argue with this number, but it doesn't matter, right? The point is, if the system can only liquidate $30 million worth of this, then it leaves a system with $24 million with a bad debt, because, yeah, you can't liquidate his position. So how is this bad debt going to be resolved? Well, it's going to be resolved with the Aave stability module, the safety module. And how it works is if you stake your aave on AAve, then you earn some yield, but you're also accepting the risk that whenever there's, like, bad debt, your locked aave is gonna be auctioned on the market to be sold.
00:11:56.116 - 00:12:28.584, Speaker A: So that's kind of how aave deals with bad debt. And if you want to unstake your aave, you have to wait a period of seven days. So, like, we've been seeing, like, a bunch of, like, people, like, try to unstake aave because they're scared, because, like, you know, staked Aave is, like, can't be sold. Right. You have to wait one week. Like, for example, there's, like, $200 million with a steak dahvi. But if the market knows that some of a can potentially be sold, maybe the market front runs this by selling, which I think is not the most likely outcome, but it's a possibility.
00:12:28.584 - 00:13:06.560, Speaker A: I'm just letting you know what could happen in the worst case scenario. Aave does have a treasury of $37 million, but this is also where they pay employees from, so ideally, they don't tap into this. So even if there's bad debt in the ecosystem, it's going to come out of here. So it's not going to destroy the markets ultimately. But, you know, either way, I think there's, like, a major headwind sort of token here. So in terms of summary and in terms of what I think is going to happen, I think Michael is still rich, too connected. And sure, he might not seem like he has the money right now, but if he can buy enough time, he's going to figure out a way to slowly sell his position over time.
00:13:06.560 - 00:13:12.130, Speaker A: I do expect a very slow bleed in the price of CRVD and Ave.
00:13:12.170 - 00:13:12.322, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:12.346 - 00:13:17.586, Speaker A: The token is going to have some headwinds, because until this problem is resolved, it's going to be really hard for buyers to step in.
00:13:17.618 - 00:13:18.098, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:18.234 - 00:13:19.770, Speaker A: Because, like, what if there's bad debt?
00:13:19.810 - 00:13:20.226, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:20.338 - 00:14:07.384, Speaker A: Of course. Like, it's not going to go, like, neither token is going to go to zero. There's always value here, but, you know, like, headwinds for these prices, because, like, Michael's position has to be unwound over time. So that's, like, half of the CRB supply that has to be sold. So, like, why would anyone, like, hold CRP longer term? It's not going to go to zero because you can buy CRV, lock it up, and earn the transaction fees, but also, if the CRV price is going down, then there's less incentive to LP on curve, and then you kind of have to think about the implications there. I can easily see aave striking up some deal with curve and Michael to protect the entire position so that there isn't some cascading liquidation. Because if there is a cascading liquidation, then AavE holders and Aave lenders are going to be left holding the bag.
00:14:07.384 - 00:14:11.696, Speaker A: So if you're holding, if you're lending USDT on Aave Mainnet, I would be careful.
00:14:11.728 - 00:14:11.896, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:11.928 - 00:14:32.488, Speaker A: Just be aware of the risks, because if there is a cascade cascading liquidation, there's a chance that you won't be able to put out, pull out your USDT. We kind of saw this with Venus protocol when there was, like, the bridge hack with binance smart chain, the BNB. I mean, basically, the binance team basically, like, took over that position just so that, like, liquidations won't happen. And they agreed that they're going to liquidate this position over time.
00:14:32.544 - 00:14:32.832, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:32.896 - 00:14:48.214, Speaker A: I. So I can see a similar event happening. Right? So, like, maybe Ave team is like, okay, like, Michael, like, we're going to, like, not allow liquidations here, but you have to promise us that you're going to pay, like, 20% interest rates for your USDT. Please liquidate your house.
00:14:48.262 - 00:14:48.494, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:48.542 - 00:15:03.102, Speaker A: Please sell your mansion in Australia. Please sell all your angel investments equity for dollars and, like, pay back our loan. And then, like, there's, like, the moral argument of, like, or, like, this, another argument of, like, is Michael willing to do that?
00:15:03.126 - 00:15:03.286, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:03.318 - 00:15:49.218, Speaker A: Is Michael willing to, like, liquidate his house mansion, like, miss out on upside for his other angel investments to, you know, like, get rid of this? I'm not quite sure. Right. And there's also the argument where, like, you know, if Michael can, like, hold on to all his, like, equity deals for, like, three years, then, like, at some point, they're gonna be worth billions, and then he can pay. So, you know, like, he. The point is, Michael needs time, right? If he can buy enough time, the entire situation is going to be fine. But I guess there's uncertainty around the time component, so there's a bunch of fear around there. And also, if ever could ever, for example, and Fraxland and other money markets agree to not boost up interest rates, then it's also a way for Michael to slowly buy time.
00:15:49.218 - 00:16:41.992, Speaker A: However, if one of them defects as an abracadabra, they're saying, you know what? Screw you, we're going to boost interest rates, then that also puts pressure on the entire system. Like, for example, if everyone doesn't do anything, then buys Michael time, maybe no bad debt happens, but if Evercade ever forces Michael to pay back $12 million or whatever, then Michael has to sell curve at lower prices as a form of forced partial liquidations. OTC. OTC markets, then that could also lead to lower prices, and then Aave has to do something. Hopefully this doesn't happen, but there's risk there. So implications for the rest of DeFi. Is this going to nuke our bags? Is this going to destroy Defi? I don't really think so, because I think most of the risk is contained within CRV and AAvE, as in the holders.
00:16:41.992 - 00:17:38.040, Speaker A: CRV holders are going to suffer, because who's going to buy this thing and what's going to be their fair value? Maybe it's very, very much lower then. Maybe AAvE holders and Aave lenders might be left holding the bag in the short to medium terminal. But I think the treasury can cover it. So I think it's gonna be fine. But if you're, like, an Aave holder, the token, then it's not gonna be good for, I guess, like, the image, right? Like the brand value and whatnot. Because no matter what happens, right, like, whether this happens in the next three months, three years, 30 years, Michael is gonna have to sell his CRV either through willing, like, by himself, or like, just like we're, like, forced and some bet that is likely to form somewhere. And I think it's gonna be on Aave, but I think Aave can, you know, use the treasury and the safety module, sell tokens and, like, figure it out, because, you know, like, like, worst case scenario, like, maybe Ave has to sell a bunch of tokens to, like, VC's, like, a significant discount to raise up cash.
00:17:38.040 - 00:18:20.228, Speaker A: I think a VC is willing to step up and, like, other buyers are willing to step up. To like, let that happen. And there's not gonna be like a down, like, like, like a spiral of like entire, like, systems, like, being destroyed, in my opinion. I think both tokens are gonna bleed. I mean, it doesn't mean that things can't pump via short squeezes and like narrative, but I think, you know, there's major headwinds for both tokens. Shorting is like dangerous because like I mentioned, there's like PvP games to be played where like some, some player can like OTC CRBD, you know, like, and then before announcing it, they can like this like lever long CRB and then like liquidate shorts that way. So like there's like that risk.
00:18:20.228 - 00:18:38.812, Speaker A: But I think, you know, CRB is going to experience like a slow bleed. I think Ave can recover, but it's going to take some time. And I think most likely outcome is like, you know, Michael is going to just slowly find ways to liquidate his positions of CRV or other assets and we don't really have to deal with like huge amounts of that debt.
00:18:38.836 - 00:18:39.200, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:39.300 - 00:19:06.968, Speaker A: I think the worst case scenario can be avoided. CRV price now is also going to be bad for projects that rely on the price of CRV. Like, for example, yearn, right? They're like an auto compounder. They kind of rely on CRB price being pretty high because that's one source of the yield. Same goes for Frac seed, because the growth of staked Frax seed kind of relies on like, LP rewards being high. It's not going to destroy these protocols, but it kind of puts like a cap on like how much they can grow. And then other money markets, they're probably going to be reluctant to list altcoins.
00:19:06.968 - 00:20:01.980, Speaker A: Maybe more projects are going to go like the Fraxland route. And like, maybe like the next generation of money markets are going to be isolated pools with variable interest rates instead of like cross collateralization. I think cross collateralization is like totally fine, but it's going to be limited to like, majors such as bitcoin, ether and other stable coins. Curve is part of grassroots DeFi. I obviously want it to succeed, but even if it goes to zero, like, it's not going to like destroy deFi, right? Liquidity is going to just go elsewhere and price nuking might destroy sentiment and people will call for the death of DeFi. But I don't really see it as like a huge risk to the markets, let's say like two months from now, right? But like maybe it's bad for sentiment. It's not going to be a Luna situation because, yeah, like CRV, like Michael gets liquidated, right? It's like, right, like it doesn't really affect us, you know, like with like the whole Luna situation, right? It's like all the VC's and like the funds were like levered to the tits.
00:20:01.980 - 00:20:44.938, Speaker A: So like when Luna went to zero, they had to liquidate their entire bitcoin and ether position, which like destroyed the entire markets. But in this situation, the only person that's like leveraged CRB is the founder, right? So maybe Michael's net worth goes down a lot, but that's about it in the grand scheme of things, right? Maybe sentiment's bad, but to be honest, other DeFi protocols, their token prices have been doing pretty well. Real world assets, Makerdao, they've been doing fine. Uniswap token has been doing well, maybe because their competitor seems to be going down. So I don't think it's like that big of a deal, to be honest. Also highlight some flaws in Aave governance. There's a lot of anger towards Michael, but, you know, the system allowed him to do this.
00:20:44.938 - 00:21:23.970, Speaker A: So maybe things has to be, you know, things has to be revisited there. So, you know, maybe Michael gets liquidated, right? Maybe, you know, the overall wealth in the Defi ecosystem goes down because like as a result, maybe sentiment doesn't recover anytime soon to smart contract risk and whatnot. But you know, like, I don't really think it poses a risk. Right? Like real world assets are still chugging along, right? Like, you know, the maker bold thesis is still intact. There's still innovations happening within like the Defi space. I don't really think it's a systemic thing. I just think that, you know, for some protocols that are affected, it's not going to be good for them, but for everyone else.
00:21:24.010 - 00:21:24.186, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:24.218 - 00:21:38.060, Speaker A: Like, if Aave loses market share, then maybe maker compound other margin markets can't take their place. If curve loses market share, then other dexs like Uniswap, maverick Protocol, ambient balancer, they're going to take out more market share.
00:21:38.100 - 00:21:38.276, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:38.308 - 00:22:08.770, Speaker A: Like that's just going to happen, right? I mean, that's kind of how I see this entire event unfolding. So hopefully this kind of gave a good overview of the situation in under half an hour, but that's ultimately how I see the situation going. CRV, not great, ave some headwinds there, but generally rest of markets, I don't really think it's that big of a deal.
