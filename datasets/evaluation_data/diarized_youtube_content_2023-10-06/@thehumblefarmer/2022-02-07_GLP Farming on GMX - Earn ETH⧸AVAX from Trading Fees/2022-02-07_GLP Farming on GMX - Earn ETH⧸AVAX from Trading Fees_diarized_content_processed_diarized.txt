00:00:00.360 - 00:00:21.838, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taki here. And in this video I want to go over GMX farming and why it's one of my favorite farms in this type of environment. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. None of this is financial advice. So what is GMX? Well, it's a platform that's currently available on Avalanche and Arbitrum. And it's a decentralized spot in perpetual exchange that supports low swap fees and zero price impact trades. Right.
00:00:21.838 - 00:01:03.812, Speaker A: TLDR, you can make swaps for assets and I guess leverage trade. And this is like the UI, right? You can just, you know, go like ten x long Avax if you want to. And on the other hand, you can also go short five x eight x or something. And also there's a swap feature where you can take, let's say Avax swap into USDC, etcetera. It's actually one of the lowest slippage ways to trade. And I think a lot of yield aggregators go through GMX not only for leverage trades, but also for just no spot trades as well. The, the beauty of GMX and the farming aspect that I really like is that you can be a liquidity provider on GMX and earn trading fees paid in Avax or ETh, right? This is called GLP, right? GMX liquidity providing.
00:01:03.812 - 00:01:39.328, Speaker A: And you know, I like it because it actually pays you in Avax or Eth, right? Like no, paid in farm token b's because a lot of other farms, they're like, oh yeah, 300% APY paid in our farm token. Right? It's like who cares, right? In like two weeks it's going to be like 50% because the token dumps or something. But when you're a liquidity provider on GMX, you actually get paid in Avax or ETH, right? Depending on the platform you're on. And it actually comes from fees. It's not like Amblan trust, it actually comes from the platform fees. So you can actually kind of track the fundamentals of JMX by just, you know, tracking how high the aprs are. And these aprs have been pretty high for the past couple of weeks.
00:01:39.328 - 00:02:17.406, Speaker A: And I think it's a really good way to, I guess, go risk on and also risk off actually. And I'll go over those strategies later in the video. So I took this screenshot a few days ago, so it might be a little outdated, but you know, right now on Avalanche you get paid roughly 46% paid in Abax as well as 36% in escrowed GMX. I'll go over that later in the video. On arbitrary side, you also get paid 34% and 44% in escrowed GMX. So, you know, I'll go over the tokenomics and how it actually generates fees later in the video. But what is GOP, right, like, GLP isn't like long, like buying some, like, altcoins and shit coins and, you know, like, taking on a lot of risk.
00:02:17.406 - 00:02:45.586, Speaker A: It's actually like basket of currencies that's similar to hr crypto that you can lp for. Right. Just think of it as being a liquidity fighter for a leverage trading platform. So on arbitrum, this is the target weight for GLP, right? So they want GLP to have these targets in like, in the basket of currencies. So 15% bitcoin, 25% eth, 6% link, 2% uni and 52% stable coins, right. So it's a pretty volatility muted position. And, you know, if you want to farm GLP on arbitram, you can, you know, long.
00:02:45.586 - 00:03:11.440, Speaker A: These are these assets, right, in these. In these weightings and be paid 34, 34% in Eth, which is pretty crazy, right? In 44% in escrow. JMX. Yeah. On avalanche, I like this better, right? I like it better because I don't want to long linger unity, like my personal preference. And I like avalanche for lower fees as well. But the target weight for GLP is 15% avax, 15% bitcoin, 20% eat and 50% stable coins.
00:03:11.440 - 00:03:38.964, Speaker A: And these target weightings change every week. I think it doesn't change drastically, but, you know, it's roughly 50% stable coins and 50% volatile assets. Okay, so I'm just going to focus on avalanche's side just because that's going to focus on. But, you know, if you go to the home page, it kind of shows you the current weightings and target weightings. So the number on the right side, right. So let's just focus on the ETH aspect. So the target weighting for ETH is 20%, but the current weighting is 27%.
00:03:38.964 - 00:04:02.360, Speaker A: Right. So it's never going to be perfect. But, you know, you can assume that it's going to be roughly in the. In the target weightings that I showed you earlier. And how the protocol balances the weightings is by just having fees whenever you want to buy GLP or mint GLP. And if you want to farm GLP, all you have to do is buy. You don't have to restake it anywhere if you just buy GLP, you just start earning fees.
00:04:02.360 - 00:04:26.498, Speaker A: But remember that the ETH weighting was currently higher than the target weighting. So if you want to mint GLP or buy GLP using EtH, it'll charge you a 0.37% fee. And on Avalanche's side, you can see that the target weighting was 15%, but the current weight is 7%. Right. It's underweight Avax. So the protocol will incentivize you to mint GLP using Avax by charging 0% fees.
00:04:26.498 - 00:04:49.522, Speaker A: So this is kind of how the protocol try to balances out. It doesn't, there's like no impermanent loss. It doesn't balance automatically. So maybe that's a good thing or bad thing. It just tries to rebalance through fees, right. So there's no implement loss. And I kind of consider GLP on avalanche to be quad crypto, right, because tricrypto on on curve is like 33% bitcoin ethan, stable coins.
00:04:49.522 - 00:05:40.928, Speaker A: But for GLP, it's, you know, 50% Avax e to bitcoin, 50% stable coins, right. So it's less, less volatile, but you also get to long, I guess, avax on top of it. And I asked KR, who is the mod on the discord, and he said, yeah, like, there's no implement loss. And in terms of how the aprs are calculated, it's calculated every, every week and it's updated every Wednesday. And that's like, why is it like every Wednesday? Like, why doesn't it balance every single day? And he mentioned that, you know, let's just focus on KR's response. If you think about, like, yes, trading volume, if you look at historical data, you see that on the weekdays there's a lot of trading volume, and on the weekends the trading volume drops off, right? So you can assume that, like, most people don't, like, you know, trade on the weekends. And if the trading fees are or the aprs are calculated every single day, then it's going to be very, very volatile, right.
00:05:40.928 - 00:06:07.380, Speaker A: Like every day you're going to see different aprs going to be really hard to calculate. Okay. Like, what are, you know, this week's fees going to be? So, you know, how it works is that, you know, whatever fees are paid this week, right, from. So from Wednesday to Thursday, right. Or I guess Wednesday to Tuesday, right. For that particular week, GMX, the platform, collects fees from last week, right. And this groups it together and uniformly distributes those fees this week.
00:06:07.380 - 00:06:39.422, Speaker A: And, you know, whatever next week's fees are that are paid right. For GLP holders, it's whatever fees are calculated this week. Right? So whatever fees paid out this week is from last week's fees and etc. Right? So that way, you know, it's more predictable and it's easier to be liquid for GLP. Okay. And, you know, one of the cool things about GMX is that there's a stats dashboard, and it actually allows you to track all these stats in real time. And it's kind of cool to see how many people are trading, how people are positioned long and short, and, you know, how much people are actually making on the platform.
00:06:39.422 - 00:06:54.742, Speaker A: So, you know, this is for avalanche. There's also one for arbitram. We can kind of see that, you know, this is the. The pink line is cumulative trading volume. So it's always going to be up. But you can kind of see that, okay, like, there's a lot of volume here on the week, and, like, last week, it kind of dropped off. But, you know, volume is doing fine.
00:06:54.742 - 00:07:10.910, Speaker A: And, you know, I guess fees are, you know, directly correlated to the amount of volume. And you can see that, you know, fees are going up. Right. And more fees means more rewards for liquidity providers like. Like myself. And, you know, you can also track how much people. How much money people are losing.
00:07:10.910 - 00:07:40.710, Speaker A: Right. You can see on avalanche, you know, in the past couple of. In the past two to three weeks, people haven't been doing that well. And this is because I feel like in the past two to three weeks, the markets have been bearish. And, like, this is the open interest, meaning that how many people are positioned short versus long? And, you know, people have been positioned short for a long time. And I guess in the most recent market pump, I guess people were caught offsides. And, you know, it's good because if people are short and markets are pumping, it means that they're losing money.
00:07:40.710 - 00:08:00.580, Speaker A: And if they're losing money, then it means more fees paid out to me. Okay. Okay. Let's go over to tokenomics, because I think it's one of the aspects that I also like about GMX. So for avalanche, holders of the GLP token earn escrow, GMX rewards, and 70% of platform fees. Right. So on avalanche, you get paid in Avax.
00:08:00.580 - 00:08:28.804, Speaker A: On Arbitrum, you get paid in ETH, and 70% of the fees directly go to the liquidity providers. 30% of the fees. Right? So the other 30% gets paid to GMX stakers. Right? So if you stake GMX, you also earn some fees. And, you know that that goes to you as well. And escrow, GMX, which I went over, is just GMX that's vested over twelve months, right. So I guess it's, it's, it's linearly vested every single day.
00:08:28.804 - 00:09:18.082, Speaker A: So every day you receive like one over 365 in terms of like, how much GMX you get to unlock from escrow to GMX, right? So, you know, gonna see here, you know, these screenshots are a little out there. So it kind of depends when you're watching this. But, you know, it's, historically, it's been roughly 30% to 50% paid in evacs and roughly, you know, 30% to 50% in escrow GMX. And obviously, this will get diluted as more people provide liquidity for GLP. And it also depends on how much trading and fees the protocol generates. I really like this type of tokenomics just because it's not like a pure form token. And it kind of aligns the incentives of liquidity providers, GMX stakers, as well as traders, right? Because if you're a trader, you want more, I guess, liquidity on the platform, so you can like, trade with like lower fees and whatnot, right? So GMX understands that.
00:09:18.082 - 00:10:03.650, Speaker A: So the majority of the fees go to the liquidity providers because they're the ones taking on the risk to be the liquidity provider. Also, for GMX stakers, you know, 30% of the fees goes into people that stake GMX. And there's also one other concept called multiplier points. It's kind of like Ve PTP on platypus on avalanche, where, you know, the longer you stake, the token, the more multiplier points you get. And the more multiplier points you get, the more fees you generate, right? So it kind of aligns people to stake their GMX for a longer period of time, right? So you stake GMX, you get get more multiplier points. And once you unstake, you lose the points, right? So it really does incentivize you to, you know, just keep staking your GMX. And this also applies to escrowed GMX as well.
00:10:03.650 - 00:10:29.224, Speaker A: And in terms of, like, the fees boost that you get, you get more Avax and eat depending on the platform you're in. But this only applies to the GMX yields. So it doesn't boost your GLP rewards, but it boosts your GMX yields. And the GMX yields are a little lower, right? So it's roughly 20% to 30%. But, you know, you can see the boost percentage here. So the longer you stake, the more boost you get. And the more boost you get, the higher this number goes up.
00:10:29.224 - 00:11:22.258, Speaker A: The documentation is really confusing, and that's the reason I had to ask the mod. So, you know, maybe some points in this video I got some few things wrong, but I'm just going off of whatever I see in the docs and whatever the mod told me. Okay, let's go over some risks because there are some risks because you're not just a liquidity fighter on the Dex, you're a liquidity fighter on a trading platform. So if a bunch of God tier traders came onto GMX and they just like 100 x short, 100 x long, and they get everything, right, well, there's a chance that you lose money, right, because you're taking the other side of the trade. But, you know, historically, I think you can assume that most traders are losing money, right? And I think on average, you know, even if you're optimistic about, like, people's ability to trade, you know, maybe they'll break even at best. On, I mean, on avalanche, you know, people are losing money on arbitrum, people are losing even more money. Right.
00:11:22.258 - 00:11:52.760, Speaker A: Arbitrum, they've been around since August on GMX. Sorry, on GMX has been live since August on arbitrum, and traders are down $9 million. And, you know, Avalanche, they've been on since like early, sorry, early January, and they've lost roughly $1.5 million. Right. So, you know, it's, I guess there's a risk that, like, you know, some genius comes online and, like, makes $100 million and like, you know, like, it comes out of us. But, you know, that's the risk you take and that's one of the reasons why there are such high rewards.
00:11:52.760 - 00:12:41.556, Speaker A: Right? Perhaps, you know, I guess, I guess one of the risks is that, I guess the markets have been pretty hard to trade recently just because, you know, people have got bearish now markets are like bullish yada, yada, yada, yada. But I guess one of the risks is that if we just enter this up, only market and apes just come onto the platform in like ten x leverage long, they can sprint money, and that could be a risk. So I think it's a good platform or good farm if you think that the markets will be choppy and a lot of traders are going to get wrecked. But if you think we're going to v recovery and every, you know, every leverage long traders and make money, then it might be high risk for you. Right? And, you know, you know, assuming Jeff Bezos is in yellow trading, get lucky seems like a nice way to DC strong assets and earn yield. There's also smart contract risk, as always, they're audited, but, you know, there's always smart contract risk. So let's go over a few strategies.
00:12:41.556 - 00:13:26.086, Speaker A: Two strategies that I'm deploying right now. One simple way is to spy GLP, right? You can just be a liquidity provider. You know, I think it's a pretty interesting pool, right? You get to long avalanche, bitcoin eth, right? Three assets that I'm bullish on and 50% stable coins, and also get paid decent yields. The other strategy that I want to go over is hedging with GLP. So I think last week or two weeks ago, I made a video about hedging and how I talked about, okay, like, there are so many good hedging strategies in defi, I'm probably always going to have hedges on, right? It doesn't mean that I'm bearish the markets. I'm just always going to have hedges on, right? So, for example, if I'm like 100k, like long crypto, I might have like a 20k hedge on, right? Just so I can minimize my downside, even though that might. Sorry.
00:13:26.086 - 00:14:22.170, Speaker A: Yeah, minimize my downside, even though that might minimize my upside. So what you can do, right, you can borrow bitcoin eth or Avax on Aave and mint GLP, right? So what you're technically doing is because GLP is 50% stable coins and 50% volatile assets. If you short Avax, for example, and buy GLP with it, you're effectively selling off 50% of your Avax into stable coins, and the other 50% gets split into bitcoin, eat and Avax, right? So if Avax goes up, you lose money, technically, because your short Avax and GOP underperforms. But if Avax dumps a lot, right, if the markets dump, then you make money from your hedge, because, you know, Avax is higher beta. And, you know, if bitcoin goes down 10%, chances are Avax is down 1520 25%. So I'll go over the math of how this might affect your portfolio. So two examples, short Avax market pump and short Avax market dump, right? And see how that affects.
00:14:22.170 - 00:14:51.924, Speaker A: So, hopefully you can see this. But I'm just going to use round numbers. $10,000. I mean, at the end of the day, the dollar amount doesn't really matter. It's more about the percent difference. So if you short $10,000 of Avax into GLP, you take $10,000 of Avax, and you split it amongst these assets. Right? And I'm just going to assume that the GOP weightings are the target weightings, right? So as I mentioned earlier, and as I shown earlier, the weightings are not perfect.
00:14:51.924 - 00:15:30.194, Speaker A: But, you know, for the sake of simplicity, let's just assume these weightings. So let's assume that, you know, bitcoin goes up a lot, and then higher beta plays, like Ethan Avax also go up a lot. In that case, you know, these basket of currencies, the value changes to this, right? And, you know, GoP is at $11,500. But remember that, you know, you should, you know, in this example, you're shorting Avax into this, and Avax is up 40%, right? So the amount invested, $10,000, your debt on Aave, it's actually $14,000. So, you know, because of this reason, if you. So there's no incremental loss. So I don't know why I have this here.
00:15:30.194 - 00:16:22.058, Speaker A: But if you use this strategy, you're down $2,500, right? But, you know, that's the risk you take, right, by hedging your portfolio. But what if, you know, you do the same strategy, but the market dumps, right? So let's say bitcoin dumps 10% eth 20%, avex goes down 25%. Then the value of GOP goes like this, right? Because bitcoin, Ethan Avax goes down. And, you know, because you're short Avax, you borrow $10,000 to Avax, and Avax went down 25%, you only owe $7,500. But because GLP is roughly $9,000, you make a $1,600 profit, right? So this is the kind of hedging strategies that you can do, right? And right now, I have an Avax hedge on. It's not because I'm bearish Avex. I'm, in fact, I'm super bullish Avax, right? Avex is one of the assets I'm super bullish on for this quarter and this quarter and beyond, or I guess this year.
00:16:22.058 - 00:16:48.692, Speaker A: But it's just me acknowledging that, okay, like, I'm risk gone in various parts of the portfolio. I kind of want to hedge. So I'm just going to hedge Avax and short Avax because it's the higher beta, right? That's all I'm doing. I mean, I'm still long avax in other parts of portfolio. For example, I'm like, I have a pretty big stack of Joe Avax on Defi kingdoms. So you know, it's not like I'm bearish Avax, but, you know, I'm just putting hedges on to predict my downside, you know, in case the markets do dump. Right.
00:16:48.692 - 00:17:09.096, Speaker A: Markets are strong right now, but, you know, just have hedges on. Right. Like, I don't really care. Right. I guess I'm down money right now, but, you know, the rest of my portfolio is up a lot more money, so it doesn't really matter. Okay, so hedging, you know, lower upside, hedging downside, you know, and also, if I'm short a backs, I'm also earning a back. So it's like it kind of balances off that way and I'm happy either way.
00:17:09.096 - 00:17:27.866, Speaker A: Right. And, you know, I think GMX the assets pretty interesting. And I own like 2% GMx in my portfolio. Not too big, but, you know, I plan on using GMX throughout the year. So, you know, might as well stake it and earn multiplier points, etcetera. Last thing I'll go over is the GMX blueberry club. This is kind of cute, actually.
00:17:27.866 - 00:17:41.826, Speaker A: It's kind of like this NFT collection to help boost. To help boost the treasury. So, you know, this is like one example of the NFT. It's literally blueberries. 10,000 have been minted a couple weeks ago. And, you know, it's pretty cool. The floor is roughly 0.25
00:17:41.826 - 00:18:18.430, Speaker A: e and they're pretty cute, actually. I actually have one for better or for worse, you know, GMX, these blueberries only applied to arbitram. And I'll go over, like, how that works. But, you know, I believe whatever money they raised from that treasury, right, from the mint, it goes into GLP, and it's like farming, right? And it's generating money for the treasury. And like, whatever, like trading fees go on. Whatever, like trading fees that blueberry club generates, it also goes to treasury. And if you hold blueberries, you can also get airdropped escrow to GMX if you're on Arbitrum.
00:18:18.430 - 00:18:48.472, Speaker A: So Treasury roughly almost $700,000 royalties year in fees. And you also get GMX airdrops. And this only applies to arbitrum, right. So if you hold GMX blueberries on Arbitrum, you get monthly GMX airdrops, which is kind of cool. So summary GMX, I think it's a good platform that's growing in daily active users and trading volume. GOP GMX stakers earn fees and traders benefit from liquid pool to trade from with the ability to short assets on Aave. It also opens up hedging strategies.
00:18:48.472 - 00:19:23.836, Speaker A: If you're feeling uneasy about market conditions, even if you're super bullish and you want to hedge in case you're wrong, you know, just, you know, just hedge. Right? Who cares? Right? You know, there are, I guess, black swan risks. I guess that, you know, if, you know, if a bunch of traders make a bunch of money, but, you know, I think it's fair to assume that most traders are break even or lose money. And it's kind of the same question where of like, you know, are you not going to open a casino? Right. Because casinos are very profitable. Are you not going to open. Open a casino because you fear that Bill Gates is going to come and Yolo his net worth on black and make a bunch of money? Right.
00:19:23.836 - 00:19:45.788, Speaker A: Usually not. Right? Usually not. You should assume that, you know, like, whales are whales for a reason. Like, whales aren't gonna come, like, yoloing their net words on, like, you know, like. Like longs or something, or like leverage longs or something. You know, like, they're whales because, you know, they've practiced risk management and they build up their wealth over time. So I'm not really, I don't really fear that scenario.
00:19:45.788 - 00:20:08.408, Speaker A: But I guess if we just go up 10% every single day, then it's going to be a really easy environment for longs to make money. So maybe it's. Maybe it's only a good farm if the markets are kind of choppy, right. So people go down, people will get bearish. People go up, markets go up, people will become bullish, and, you know, choppy markets, maybe it's the best way to make money on this. So, yeah, that's the end of the video. Hopefully you guys enjoyed it.
00:20:08.408 - 00:20:25.048, Speaker A: Thank you guys for watching. Let me know what your thoughts are on GMX and GOP yield farming. You know, I think it's a really good one. Right. I don't really like being paid in farm tokens, you know, usually. Right. Unless I'm bullish farm token and being paid fees on Avax in Avax is pretty cool, I think.
00:20:25.048 - 00:20:29.440, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah. Let me know what your thoughts are. Thank you, guys watching and have fun from it out there.
