00:00:00.600 - 00:00:42.001, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. And in this video I'll be going over the recent billion dollar raise by Terraform labs from various VCs and I'll be going over, you know what it's what the implications are for the US Tea Peg. And I'll be as the title of the video, making a case for Luna in a bear market. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment section below. So first of all let's go over this, right? So Luna foundation guard, right? Title lfg, right? Let's fucking go. Raised a billion dollars to form a bitcoin reserve for you, the USD stablecoin. You know this came from jump crypto, three arrows and other VCs and proceeds for the billion dollar sale is going to go towards establishing a bitcoin denominated forex reserve for UST Para's biggest stablecoin.
00:00:42.001 - 00:01:34.787, Speaker A: So I mean this announcement just came yesterday so it's not fully clear what this actually means, right? Because you know, we thought like hey like isn't USD fully backed by Luna? Or like, or like algorithmically backed by Luna? And are you saying that you know like now USD is going to be backed by both Luna and bitcoin, Right? It's, it's unclear. Right. And depending on when you're watching the video, like you know I might be completely off but you know, from my understanding, USD is still right backed by Luna but in times of, you know, crazy market volatility, the bitcoin reserve is going to come into effect to help maintain the peg. So let's go over the jump crypto announcement, right? And the billion dollar sale. It's titled the Automated Market Reserve. Right? Amr to backstop the USD PEG in times of severe volatility. And this is important because there's always been I guess this FUD around Luna about oh yeah, like it's, it's a Ponzi, it's going to collapse to zero.
00:01:34.787 - 00:02:58.857, Speaker A: And I mean those arguments are valid, right? You know it's definitely a ponzonomic system and you know when in times of severe market volatility there is a chance that you know, UST could de peg, right? And in the most recent crash I think UST went to like 95 cents, 96 cents. Much better than I think back in May of 2021 it went to like 80 cents or something, right? 80 to 85 cents. So you know, the USD peg is getting stronger and jump crypto said that yeah, the AMR is going to use its Reserves to absorb the demand and arbitrage that exists when US is trading below its peg. So you know, what is the, I guess the significance of jump crypto, right? So for those that don't know jump crypto, they're in market maker, right? They're arbitraging and they make a lot of money. They make a lot of money arbitraging market making crypto markets and they are long term aligned with the future of crypto. Because in the recent wormhole hack, right, the $305 million hack, right, where a hacker took, you know, this much ETH from wormhole, the bridge jump crypto, they put up $120,000 of its, 120,000 of its own ETH, right? $300 million worth of ETH to backstop it. Because, you know, they believe in the bridge and they want to support it in this stage of development and we're going to come out stronger than ever, right? So I know jump crypto obviously very well capitalized, very long term alignment crypto.
00:02:58.857 - 00:04:37.657, Speaker A: And you know, I mean they, you know, they put their money where they're, where they were. They put their money where their mouth is, right? Sorry, kind of blinking out. And you know, UST right now isn't completely decentralized, right? I mean, in an ideal scenario, right, there aren't really like, you know, big money backing the US Tea peg. But right now, you know, like market makers like jump crypto, you know, VCs like three arrows and terraform Labs, you know, is, you know, backing the peg, like behind the scenes, right? And you can expect that, you know, if we get some crazy market volatility, UST is being battle tested, right? Jump crypto is going to help maintain the peg, right? However, you know, you can kind of see that, you know, there are steps being taken in order for us to I guess become more battle tested over time. Because UST maybe this is a sign that like maybe UST being algorithmically backed by Luna, by Luna alone isn't enough to, you know, make it a decentralized stablecoin. Maybe UST can be a decentralized stablecoin that's backed by other decentralized asset, right? It doesn't have to be fully backed by Luna as long as ust it can be a censorship resistant stablecoin that can offer, you know, people around the world decent yields. And Jose, right, Jose Maria Meseta, he's from Delphi Digital, right, helped design the tokenomics for Mars and Astroport also goes over this aspect that, hey, like, you know, USD you know, there's always the risk of a bank run and you know, we're taking, I guess, initiatives to help backtest this.
00:04:37.657 - 00:05:42.359, Speaker A: And you know, if you kind of read between the lines of all these people, you can kind of see that, okay, like maybe in the future UST as a decentralized stablecoin isn't going to be fully backed by Luna, right? But maybe it's going to be backed by Avax. So atomize Bitcoin, right? You know, it can be a decentralized stablecoin backed by all sorts of decentralized assets. And maybe there's, there could be arguments against like why this might be bearish, the price of Luna, right? Because right now to if like USD is above tech, people can burn a dollar worth of Luna to mint one USD, right? And this kind of creates this powerful, powerful tokenomics aspect that if there's demand for USD, Luna is going to be burned and it's going to be deflationary. Right. And you can kind of see this in the history, right? Supply change. I'll provide this in the description. But you know, Terra analytics by Smart Stake, you can kind of see that, hey, like in a bearish, in a bearish phase, right? There's like high demand for stablecoin yields and it seems like, you know, more and more people are buying USD, you know, which is incentivizing a lot of people and like market makers like jump crypto to burn Luna, right? And you know, essentially profit off of the arbitrage.
00:05:42.359 - 00:06:06.121, Speaker A: And you know, Terra has. Luna has been a deflationary token recently. And maybe this is one of the reasons why the price has been doing well recently. And you know, and I'll be making a case why like maybe Luna can outperform in a bear market. Because in the 2018, 2019 bear market, you know, bitcoin outperformed most coins except chainlink. Right. So let's kind of zoom out here.
00:06:06.121 - 00:06:23.547, Speaker A: So chainlink actually outperformed in 2018, 2019. Right. As you know, it's going up only recently. It's like really underperformed. Right. So you can look at the link eth chart, right? So taking the price of link, dividing it by eth and as you can see in 2018 and 2019 and for the first half of 2020, like link just outperformed everything. Right.
00:06:23.547 - 00:07:08.325, Speaker A: And this seem to be like the same for bitcoin, but recently link has underperformed and you know, maybe, you know, the link bubble has burst. Right. I mean I like Chainlink I think has, you know, Pretty decent fundamentals, but maybe tokenomics has some issues. But maybe Luna can also be an asset like Link, right? At least in 2018, 2019 where it just outperformed ETH and BTC. You can look at the Luna BTC chart, right? So taking the price of Luna dividing by Bitcoin, right. This is, this has been right consistently in a bull market. The same goes for Luna eth, right? There, there isn't perfect price history but you know, it's, it's, it's, it's in an uptrend, right? And you know, part of the reason is because, you know, part of the reason, obviously it's because of the tokenomics, right? It's got strong economics.
00:07:08.325 - 00:07:33.385, Speaker A: And you know, the anchor reserve, right? Let's go to the dashboard. The Inca reserve recently got refilled to half a billion dollars worth of UST. So, so, you know, this is where the 19.5% is coming from. And in the short term, right, these yields aren't sustainable. Right. Terraform Labs, they're considering they're consistently having to replenish the yields, you know, because you know, these rates are way too high.
00:07:33.385 - 00:08:28.025, Speaker A: But you know, I have some USD on here and you know, with the recent announcement, a billion dollar raise with the understanding that, you know, there are market makers backing the peg, I think that, you know, this, I think the UST FUD is overblown. I think, you know, people FUD UST for engagement, right? Because you know, FUD gets a lot of engagement. But I think the USD peg is safe and I think these yields are really attractive in these types of market conditions. And also one thing I want to go over is that, you know, right now the borrow rate for anchor is positive. Meaning that if you take ETH or Luna, right, Put it as collateral and borrow, let's say UST, you're being paid to borrow because you're paying 12% APR for USD, but you're being paid 15% in anchor tokens. And for some reason the anchor token has like went up a lot, right? It's kind of doubled since the end of January. I don't really know why this is.
00:08:28.025 - 00:08:57.637, Speaker A: Right, but you know, it's happening. Maybe it's because, you know, they're, they're going to introduce a ve anchor. I don't fully buy into that aspect but you know, I mean, people are buying it for a reason. And you know, in terms of like anchor sustainability, if the, if the anchor price is going up, then it means distribution. APR is up, meaning that, you know, more people are Going to borrow, right. They're incentivized to borrow which is going to help replenish the anchor reserve. So in these types of markets I think there's a strong case to be made for USD.
00:08:57.637 - 00:09:12.381, Speaker A: 19.5% is really good and you know, you can't really get that elsewhere. Right. You know, the idea of there is no alternative. Stocks might be bearish, crypto may be bearish. You ust, right. Could be a good way to earn yield on your assets.
00:09:12.381 - 00:09:37.055, Speaker A: Right. So this video isn't really a bullish Luna video. It's more bullish the US Tea peg and the bullish anchor yields and the opportunities that this presents. So it's kind of over mirror, right? Because I went over mirror back in like July of 2021 and I've been, you know, historically, I mean I've been bullish when all this time and this idea of short forming. So let's just focus on Microsoft I guess. Right. Because, because right now it has the highest ratio.
00:09:37.055 - 00:09:57.295, Speaker A: But what you can do is you can take a ust which is you know, interest bearing Luna. Right, sorry, interest bearing USD. Right. So a USD is appreciating 19.5% per year and you can, you know, use it as collateral to mint or not mint, but to short form Microsoft. Right. So you know this position is appreciating 20% a year.
00:09:57.295 - 00:10:19.067, Speaker A: Right. So I'm using interest bearing collateral to short farm Microsoft right now which is yielding a 22%. So let's, if you actually look at historical mirror APRs, you can kind of see that. Let's go to the charts here. Short APR Microsoft historically has a had a short APR of 18.5%. So let's put that in the calculator here. Right.
00:10:19.067 - 00:10:37.281, Speaker A: 18.5%. What the hell. Okay, 18.5%. Okay, let's increase the decimal points here. 18.5%. And let's say you want to go delta neutral. Sorry, Delta neutral meaning that you want to short Microsoft and long Microsoft by the same dollar amount.
00:10:37.281 - 00:10:51.641, Speaker A: So if you go to the, if you go to the here, if you go to the long APR Microsoft here. 15.36% right. So let's just say 15.4, 15.4%. Okay. And in that case let's just use a round number.
00:10:51.641 - 00:11:21.415, Speaker A: Right. Let's say you put $10,000 in the USD uses this collateral to short form. And you know, I mean I have tutorials. Right. But you know, essentially you have to over collateralize. So in order for you to short form Microsoft you have to put up Collateral mint Microsoft and then sell it in the open market, right. So these positions has to be over collateralized and as long as your position gets to below 150% collateral collateralization ratio, you, you could get liquidated.
00:11:21.415 - 00:11:48.295, Speaker A: Right. So anchor, so mirror says you know, the Safe amount is 200% but let's actually do the math. So if you go to here, right, Microsoft short $10,000 in collateral liquidation level 150%. If you set the collateral ratio to be let's say 220%, you know you're going to borrow this much, right. And Microsoft would have to appreciate 47% in order for you to get liquidated. That doesn't seem unlikely in this type of market. So let's say 200%, right.
00:11:48.295 - 00:12:17.323, Speaker A: This safe enough. And in this case, you know, Microsoft would have to appreciate 33% overnight in order for you get liquidated. But keep in mind that you know you're using AUSD as collateral, meaning that ausd is appreciating 20% per year roughly. So it's not just that if Microsoft goes up 33% over the course of the next 12 months, you're not going to get liquidated because your collateral has appreciated by 19.5%. So let's just use $5,000 for the safe figure. I guess put it into here, right. Short form.
00:12:17.323 - 00:12:35.579, Speaker A: And at 18.5, you're going to receive roughly $900 per year, right. You're being paid out in the mirror token, right. And mirror token is a farm token. It's going to get dumped on, right. But you know, for the sake of this example, let's just put that here and then let's assume that you're going to go, you want to go delta neutral. So whenever your USD gets unlocked, right.
00:12:35.579 - 00:12:54.703, Speaker A: I think it takes 21 days, you can go back and long form it here, right. I'm not going to take like the current nominal value, right. Because you know these rates fluctuate. That's why I'm thinking like the historical value of you know, from this website. I'll also link this in the description. It's not like completely delta neutral, right. For with the way like long forming works.
00:12:54.703 - 00:13:47.489, Speaker A: But you know, it's pretty close to like delta neutral as you can get. We can also do is like you know, if you're bullish like gold for example, right. If you look at the price of gold, it's like doing well and you know like gold is gold, right. It's, you know, it's, it's not that exciting but you Know, maybe you can short a tech stock, right? Like Microsoft and long farm Gold. And you know, historically gold yields, you know, where's gold down here, right? 10%, right? So it's not yielding that much. But you know, if you want to short a tech stock like, you know, Twitter or whatever, right? Or Microsoft and then long something like, you know, gold, right? That's also a strategy you can deploy. But let's just assume that, you know, I just do Microsoft and if I do Microsoft, right? And short form on mirror, long form at current rates, at current historical rates, with the current price of mirror, you know, you can take USD and earn 36% with it, right? Which is pretty attractive if you want to go risk off, right? Let's say you want to go on vacation.
00:13:47.489 - 00:14:04.443, Speaker A: Maybe you can just open this position and just like go on vacation, right? Maybe that's something that's attractive to you. So the point I'm making here is that, you know, maybe Luna can outperform in a bear. I mean, look at this chart. This is, this is ridiculous, right? It's up so much. Let's take this off log so, you know, it's okay. Okay, that's. That looks a little bit more scary.
00:14:04.443 - 00:15:09.159, Speaker A: Let's zoom in so it's less scary right here. Maybe Luna can outperform in a bear. And I also forgot to address the idea of, I guess, you know, if Luna isn't like all the collateral, right? Not I guess, all the backing of usc, maybe that's less bullish Luna, right? Because, you know, less Luna is going to be burned. But maybe, you know, the different idea or different mindset that you might have is that like maybe USD being algorithmically backed by Luna isn't completely scalable, right? Maybe it has to be backed partially by Bitcoin, right? Maybe more by Bitcoin in order for USD to grow in market cap. So let's use round numbers, right? Let's say the limit for the market cap USD is 20 billion, right? With if like Luna is backing it, right? But maybe if it's like 50% Bitcoin, 50% Luna, maybe the upside is like, I don't know, 100 billion, right? I'm just using round numbers. Or in that case, you know, $50 billion with the Luna is going to be burned over that time period. So even though less Luna is being burned per ust mint, right? If.
00:15:09.159 - 00:16:21.475, Speaker A: No, if this type of system is going to be more sustainable, right, more scalable for the USD market cap, then it's going to be bullish Luna, right? Anyways, that being said, you know, this is like the bullish case, I guess for USD, right? USC holding Peg and if you see holds peg and you know, the market cap of, you know, Luna keeps going up, right? Or I guess USD keeps going up and you know it's going to be, you know, all things being equal, it's going to be bullish for the price of Luna, right? And as you can, as you can see, market cap is just going up, right? Market cap is going up for us. And I've often mentioned that, hey, I think, you know, Luna is the top five coin. I said this back in like sometime last year and people call me crazy. We know it's getting there, right? I mean, and I said top five not counting tether and usdc. So all it has to do is flip cardano, right? And you know, it seems more likely at this point. And lastly, I'll go over Mars just because people have been bugging me, right? And people have been like upset with me just because I haven't talked about Luna in a while. And like, you know, like, just because I don't talk about it on my channel doesn't mean that, you know, like I'm like I've abandoned it, right? You know, it's just like I just make videos that I want to make.
00:16:21.475 - 00:17:19.667, Speaker A: So, you know, I just haven't been that excited about the lock drop. So you know, if you go back to my video that I uploaded on Monday, right, I made a case like why money market tokens, like tokens, I'm just not interested in them, right? And you know, I'm not going to go over too much time in this video because I already like spent 23 minutes on this in this video. But you know, I'm not like bullish money market tokens, right? I'm bullish on apps and its effect on the ecosystem, but I'm not bullish tokens. So like for that reason, like I'm not really interested in this lock drop, right? Maybe I'm wrong, right? Maybe Mars like giga pumps and maybe I'm wrong. But like, you know, I'm not participating in lock drop, right? I'd rather just like park my, park my USD on anchor. But you know, I will go over like, you know, I guess the bullish case for Mars for I guess the entire Terra ecosystem and also for the Cosmos hub. Okay, so in this video with Danku, right? And Jose, right, I, you know, he's, he's at Delphi Labs.
00:17:19.667 - 00:18:09.543, Speaker A: He kind of went over this concept of smart contract to Smart contract lending. Because with money markets, every loan in Defi is over collateralized, right? So if you want to borrow $10,000, you have to at least put like you know, $15,000 with the e that's collateral, right? It's not really capital efficient. But with Mars it's going to allow for contract to contract borrowing. Meaning that, you know, these smart contracts, right? Or these types of lending, it's going to be under collateralized. You know, as retail users we won't be gaining access to this, but you know, it's going to whitelist some contracts in Terra applications and also for Cosmos applications, right? So I mean, you know this is. Terra is part of the Cosmos Hub, right? The Cosmos SDK, right? Terra is built on top of the Cosmos SDK, right? The Atom ecosystem. And as you can kind of see, if you hover over Terra, it's connected to all of these other applications, right? Namely osmosis, Juno, etc.
00:18:09.543 - 00:19:39.045, Speaker A: And what Jose Maria Macedo said that was pretty interesting was that what Mars can do is whitelist contracts, smart contracts for, you know, osmosis, for example, right? And it can allow leverage yield farming on osmosis by letting osmosis borrow USC under collateralized and charging them an interest rate, which I thought was pretty interesting. So not only is Mars going to be, you know, net positive for the Terra ecosystem, it's also going to be net accretive in terms of value for the entire Cosmos Hub, which I thought was interesting. Even see Juno here. Juno is also a smart contract blockchain. You know, Terra is connected, right? So in the future if Juno smart contracts want to tap into Mars for under collateralized lending, right? If the Martian Council allows it, right? If, if the Martian, if the Martian Governance Council votes in favor, it's going to allow for under collateralized lending. So you know, this is one of the reasons why I'm positive on the Cosmos Hub, right? I've made so many videos about the Cosmos Hub recently, at least this year, you know, if you've kept track with like, you know, both my long ass videos. So you know, with Cosmos Hub, as these blockchains get more built out, it's actually accrues more value for other blockchains, right? Because if Terra I guess matures as a blockchain, you know, these other smart contract blockchains can tap into Terra and I guess, you know, tap into like the innovation that's going on here, right? So you know, I think Mars is a really good protocol.
00:19:39.045 - 00:20:17.251, Speaker A: It's definitely needed. You know, I'm super Bullish money markets. I'm not participating in a lock drop because I'm not bullish at token. But if you take a macro perspective on the effect of Mars and what effect it's going to have on the entire cosmos hub, I think it's going to, you know, accrue more value for Osmosis Juno maybe secret, you know, like any other, you know, IVC blockchains that, you know, Terra is connected to. So that being said, I think that's the end of the video. How long has this video been? Okay, not too, not too bad for a tiki video. But you know, I think there is a strong case to be made for Luna potentially outperforming in a bear market.
00:20:17.251 - 00:20:38.211, Speaker A: And I'm not saying that Luna is going to do a chain link and like, you know, go up like 100x or something. I'm just saying I think there's a strong case to be made that in a bear market, Luna Bitcoin or. Yeah, Luna bitcoin, right. It's going to be, I think it's going to be in an uptrend and Luna eat is also going to be in an uptrend. That's all I'm saying. Right. I'm not saying it's going to pump.
00:20:38.211 - 00:21:05.065, Speaker A: I'm just saying that I think it has a strong chance to outperform the majors. Yeah, it's cool because you know, I think he mentions a here or maybe not, but chaos, right? You know, Luna is I guess taking on more of like fraxes approach. Right. Where you know, frax isn't. Is a partially backed, partially algorithm, algorithmic stable coin. And maybe I'll discuss FRAX more on my channel in the future. But you know, I think FRAX is also interesting.
00:21:05.065 - 00:21:32.489, Speaker A: Luna is interesting because you know, Luna just like holding Luna gains you access to gain exposure to an L1 and also a stable coin. Right. Which I think is cool. Less so. Right. It's not a null one, it's just, you know, it's just like a partially backed algorithmic stablecoin. But I think, you know, Luna is taking on an approach similar to that of frax, which I think is interesting, which I think is definitely interesting because you know, in a bear market like people I guess should be like bullish stable coins.
00:21:32.489 - 00:21:57.475, Speaker A: Right? Like maybe you're bullish like USDC growth. Right? Like maybe you're like bullish. Let's go here. Maybe you're bullish like you know, the market cap of usdc. Right. But there's like, no, sorry, but there's like no way to gain access to like the upside of usdc because, you know, Circle, I guess, is like the company backing it. And like, you know, we don't have access to like, you know, gain exposure to like circle equity.
00:21:57.475 - 00:22:28.989, Speaker A: But at least with Terra and ust, we can kind of, you know, bet on the growth of these stable coins and FRAX also. So, you know, maybe that's more attractive from an investment perspective. So, you know, as always, none of this financial advice, but something to at least consider. So thank you guys for watching. Let me know if you have your funds on anchor. Definitely cool farming opportunities here. There's definitely questions about, you know, the sustainability, sustainability of anchor yields.
00:22:28.989 - 00:23:05.295, Speaker A: You know, that's always a question, right? And you know, you should expect 19.5% to not be, you know, it's not sustainable, right? There are like a bunch of these YouTubers, other YouTubers, like, oh yeah, like I'm going to retire in the next 10 years by putting $1 million into anchor, you know, 20% a year, 200K a year. You know, it's so sick, so sick. You know, like those people, like, don't really know what they're talking about. These yields are not sustainable. If you listen to podcasts by the anchor team, you know, they've said that, hey, like, you know, we started at 20%. It's going to go down over time, right? But the goal is to offer better yields than, you know, I guess, other applications or defi applications and obviously banks.
00:23:05.295 - 00:23:42.985, Speaker A: So I would expect this to go slowly drip down over time, right? So the anchor team is like, maybe it's going to go to like 90% and 18%, 17%, 16%, but it's still going to, you know, be more attractive than like most other applications, right? Defi applications. Because I would much rather earn 19.5% in USD than like 200% in like some random like altcoin that's going to dump, right? This feels a lot more safe to me, I guess, in terms like the sustainability of these yields. So, you know, cool. Luna still holding it, right? For better or for worse. I still have it on national port for better or for worse, earning like 10%, I think. But, you know, it is what it is.
00:23:42.985 - 00:24:12.219, Speaker A: You know, macro markets looking pretty scary, right? Nasdaq putting in a lower low. That's pretty spooky. You know, bitcoin isn't looking that strong, but you know, in a sea of red, Luna doing well, right? I'm not saying that Luna is going to turbo pump from here, but what I am saying is that I think ust is going to turbo pump from here. That's the point of the video. So thank you guys watching. Have a foreman out there and let me know what you think about ust. The fud, the peg, billion dollar lfg, all that.
00:24:12.219 - 00:24:13.395, Speaker A: Yeah, have a good one.
