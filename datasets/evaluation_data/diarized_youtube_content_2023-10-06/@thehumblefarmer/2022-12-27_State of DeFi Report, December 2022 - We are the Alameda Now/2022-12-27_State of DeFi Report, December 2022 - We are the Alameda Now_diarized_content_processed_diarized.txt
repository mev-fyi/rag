00:00:01.080 - 00:00:57.634, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. Welcome to the state of DeFi Report for December. I hope everyone had a merry Christmas and, you know, 2022 awful year, right? You know, it's pretty bad, but, you know, instead of crying about the past, let's try to look forward into the future and think about, you know, what kind of stories, what kind of narratives, what kind of projects have the fundamentals to actually survive this type of bear market. Especially when, you know, people can clip four to 5% yield on, you know, I guess, fiat dollars outside the crypto ecosystem. So it's really crunching the types of yield opportunities that you can do on chain. A lot of people, right, less sophisticated people have been saying that farming is dead. And I will be honest, I think 90, 95% of farming, the basic yield farming that got retailed into crypto, single staking Eid to earn 20% or entering random pool twos, uni v two style pools, those are definitely dead.
00:00:57.634 - 00:01:40.560, Speaker A: I I think if you want to earn like, actual yield that you're going to be happy with in 2023, you're going to have to, you know, go out the risk curve or, you know, actually, like, learn different types of LP strategies they can do. I'll talk about that. I think GLP Tricrypto I talked about, but also the people that's probably going to make the most amount of sustainable yield are going to be people that actually know how to do concentrated liquidity not only for, you know, univ three. Right, uniswap, but also for nfts. And I'll talk about, you know, I've been trying to get into nfts more. I recently bought Apache Penguin and I've recently been sweeping floors of the penguin ecosystem and, you know, being an LP, so I'll talk about that later. And, you know, there's that.
00:01:40.560 - 00:02:37.412, Speaker A: And, you know, we'll also talk about, you know, Alameda, right? They're blowing the fuck out, right? So they were notorious for dumping. So, you know, who is going to take their place as the notorious farm and dumpers of, you know, the defi ecosystem? And, you know, if we don't step up, right, if the humble farmer does not step up to farm and dump tokens right now, right, like we have to take advantage of the liquidity that exists on chain, right? Like farm and dump, right? That is the motto for at least q one or it's been the motto for Q four and q one of next year and hopefully not in Q two, right. Maybe we can actually have some capital appreciation, but definitely looking into farming and dumping strategies. So before I get into talking about how we are the new Alameda, let's talk about the staked eth benchmark and LSD tokens. And these LSD tokens, they're not the ones that you find at Coachella. It's actually liquid staking derivatives. So things like lido, rocket pool, fracs, stakewise.
00:02:37.412 - 00:02:54.808, Speaker A: And I'll talk about why I think that sector has really strong fundamental tailwinds for Q one and Q two of next year. Okay? So let's talk about that. First, none of this financial advice. I have no idea what I'm doing. These are, I'm recording this on the 26th. I hold these three tokens, you know. Yeah.
00:02:54.808 - 00:03:28.304, Speaker A: I hold these three tokens. So I'm biased, obviously. But let's keep talking about the state detection. So, you know, if you think about, I guess, like, risk assets, right, when people can earn 45% yield on, like, dollars, it makes risk assets less attractive to hold, right? I mean, obviously. And that's one of the reasons why, you know, dollars have been leaving the ecosystem. But you can apply the same line of thinking for, I guess, on chain yield for crypto, you know, if you. If you're trying to, like, actually go out the risk curve, and that is the staked eat benchmark.
00:03:28.304 - 00:03:54.240, Speaker A: Okay? Because right now, right, you can stake eat using these liquid staking derivatives, whether it's frax, eat, lido, rocket pool, or ret stakewise. And you can earn, like, five to 10% yield, right. Pretty safely. Um, and, okay, maybe, maybe not okay. I mean, no, like always doing research. Um, and you can also, like, buy things like coinbase eat, right? Which is trading at discount. Um, and, you know, things like kucoin eat, cracking eth, you know, they're all trading at discounts.
00:03:54.240 - 00:04:11.172, Speaker A: And if you're willing to buy them and sit on them, you can actually earn, like, close to 10% yield, sometimes even more, depending on the discount. But, you know, for example, this is Fraxie, right? You can earn 8.5% on either, right? Uh, that paid. That's paid in Eth. And then this is the curve pool, 8%. Um, right. You can lp, and they're an 8%.
00:04:11.172 - 00:05:07.666, Speaker A: And as you can see, right. I mean, there's no wonder why Frac seed has been going up, because now they're offering competitive rates. So the concept is if ETh can yield you over 8% in a relatively safe manner, right? As in, you know, it's low risk of rug, low risk of exploit the farm. Like, the token isn't going to dump, right? So it's like relatively sustainable. Then the risk reward of other yield opportunities in Defi get really crunched, right? Because, you know, I can stake my ETh with Frax and earn 8%. So if there's like, this new project offering me 15% yield on ETh, I mean, first of all, like, where is it coming from? But, you know, secondly, like, you know what? Like, I don't, I don't, I don't want to deal with those stress, right? It's like, I'd rather just stake it with Lido, stake it with fracs, like rocket pull whatever, earn my 8%, and not even, like, have to deal with these, like, random defi protocols with anon founders with no track record. And that's, I mean, I've been saying this for quite some time now, but I expect, like, more.
00:05:07.666 - 00:06:00.460, Speaker A: I mean, it's already happening, but, you know, more defy tv, all right? Money to flow back onto mainnet to take advantage of this and to also de risk from bridge risk and for people to also de risk their money right there, like, TVL on, like, random protocols and reconsolidate it into, like, defi blue chips, which is curve aave, uniswap, etcetera, because, yeah, like 8%, 16%. Yeah, I mean, that's kind of a big deal, right? If some, like, random protocol can offer 16%, but is it worth the risk? Probably not, right? Probably not. And I think there's a relatively good case to be made for these DeFi 1.0 tokens to actually outperform in 2023. They're, like, memed as worthless governance tokens because they were down only against Eid in 2021 and 2022. It's been doing okay. But I do think that, I think the Alto one narrative is kind of dead right now.
00:06:00.460 - 00:06:38.830, Speaker A: There's no demand for block space. And if you think about the types of tokens with fundamentals that people are willing to hold, I think it's going to be cash generating tokens. And even if they don't share the revenue, even if they don't have revenue share, you can think of it as investing in angel. It's like angel investing. You're investing in the future or the protocol. Some stocks in the stock market yield 0% dividends, but there's still demand for them, right? If the fundamentals are strong and they're gaining market share and whatnot. So, I mean, I'm not, like, advocating for some of these tokens, but I think there's a strong case to be made for it.
00:06:38.830 - 00:07:27.368, Speaker A: And yeah, I think TVO dominance for Eat and it's L2 s will continue to go up. Arbitrum actually hit number four, recently flipped Polygon Avenge. And I think it's, I'm pretty sure Arbitrum is gonna flip Tron and binance smart chain in 2023. And, yeah, the second point in your project is going to have trouble attracting to Vo due to poor risk adjusted, poorer risk adjusted returns. And, you know, like, people can launch random, like, new projects and like, they can hype it up, right? They can like, you know, you know, pay influencers and like, shill it and give them seeded allocations. It's like, you know, it's probably not going to attract that much money, right? Like, in the integrand scheme of things. So, I mean, I feel like generally, like a rule of thumb that you can deploy, right, is maybe consolidate to your capital to, like, you know, the blue chips.
00:07:27.368 - 00:08:18.762, Speaker A: And then when, you know, money is flowing back sometime next year, hopefully maybe you can then, like, spread out across different protocols and then, you know, actually look at the fundamentals of different projects and allocate capital there. So that's kind of how I'm viewing it. And, you know, it's, it's kind of like, you know, if you can earn 45% on certificates of deposits on fidelity or something, then there's like no point earning 2% on AAve. And similarly, if you can earn 8% on ETH, then there's no point earning 20% on ETH on like, some random, like, whatever project, right? So let's talk about LSD tokens, right? Liquid staking derivative tokens, and why I think they have really strong tailwinds for the next couple of quarters. So let's actually look at this. So actually, let's look at this first, actually. So this is for all the l ones, right? I.
00:08:18.762 - 00:08:46.190, Speaker A: Hopefully you can see this. It says the staking ratio. So it kind of looks at the percent of the l one token that's staked relative to the entire circulating supply. So ETH has roughly 13% of their supply stake, whereas Cardano has 71% BNB. Like, you know, like, I mean, CZ has 90% of its staked. Solana. Okay, maybe this numbers change, but, you know, it's 69% avalanche, 61.
00:08:46.190 - 00:09:30.868, Speaker A: Polygon, 37. But, you know, it's like multisig. I mean, it's like the majority of one tokens, they have a pretty high staking ratio, because why not, right? Like, if you can earn, like, you know, in the case of staked ETH, right? If you can stake EtH, earn 5% ish and then use it as collateral and defi, you can lp for it, then there's like no reason for you to hold EtH over staked ETH. And I expect this number to match these figures maybe like 60% to 80% by the end of 2023. Okay, so you might be asking yourself, like, why, like, why is it only 13%? Well, it's because, you know, beacon chain withdrawals are not like yet. And Tim Baiko, right, of. He like helps work on Ethereum, but he mentioned that liquid, sorry, beacon chain withdrawals will be enabled around March of next year.
00:09:30.868 - 00:10:08.160, Speaker A: So what that means is if you actually go to. Okay, so let's actually go back to user scan. What you can do is you can look at beacon chain or beacon deposit contract, was it? Yeah. So you can look up beacon deposit contract and right now, like roughly 16 million. Right. Roughly $19 billion worth of ETH is staked with the beacon chain. And starting March, people can actually start to withdraw, I guess the ether on the beacon chain, this could be some fun right around March because there's going to be $19 billion that was previously locked, that's going to enter supply, and I'm sure that it's going to bring extra selling.
00:10:08.160 - 00:10:46.142, Speaker A: If you think about it, the people that stake in the beacon chain, they did it in 2020. And if someone was willing to stake at least 32 ether into the beacon chain in 2020, then if you think about the psychographic of that type of person, then chances are they're longer term aligned. They're probably well off financially. And even if they sell, it might be for the tax purposes. I don't think it's going to create significant amounts of selling, but there's definitely to be some incremental selling. We definitely can't deny that. I guess I can link this in the description, but nice dune analytics dashboard by Mister Hill dobby.
00:10:46.142 - 00:11:20.786, Speaker A: That kind of goes over like how the supply, the LSD tokens are distributed. So, you know, 13% fee is staked, like roughly 30% by Lido right there. Like definitely like the monopoly, you know, kind of goes over here. And what I wanted to go over is here, right? So right now, 89% of, I guess, etH, right, like liquid staking over tokens. Our stake with Lido, followed by rocket poll anchor, I mean, anchor kind of got exploited recently. So I don't know about that stakewise, etcetera. And then, you know, there's like all these centralized exchanges that also stake it.
00:11:20.786 - 00:11:43.730, Speaker A: But given what happened to FTX and whatnot, I feel like, you know, less retail will be, will be open to staking their ETH with centralized exchanges. I mean, of course, like when sentiment shifts. Right? When like retail comes back then. Yeah, like people will like stake it on Coinbase because it's easy, right. I think Coinbase takes like a 25% fee, but you know, like less sophisticated retail, like they don't really care. Right. It's like, oh, stick with Coinbase.
00:11:43.730 - 00:12:04.322, Speaker A: But I definitely expect. Right, like the argument I'm making is right now, 13% is faked. I expect that number to be 60% to 80% by the end of the year. So you know, from. For like next twelve months, we have to see more eat enter the liquid staking derivative token landscape. And of course right now it's majority led by Lido. Right.
00:12:04.322 - 00:13:01.478, Speaker A: But I think once people get their ETh out of the beacon chain, there's going to be some rebalancing, reshuffling process where, you know, maybe if people feel uncomfortable about like the centralization risk with Lido, even though, you know, it's better than, I guess, Coinbase or binance or Kraken having the majority to share, if someone gets like, you know, a bunch of eat back, maybe they'll distribute their ETH amongst the different LSD tokens or LSD projects such as rocket pull fracs stakewise. And I think, you know, generally I think that's going to bring significant tailwinds for these types of projects. So let's go back to here and there. There are a few other reasons why these types of tokens can do well. So the first white farming emissions can end post withdrawals. So I've heard arguments on like why farming emissions might continue. But basically the idea is right now, let's say lido, right? Like ETH and staked ETH, there's a pool on curve, there's a pool on balancer.
00:13:01.478 - 00:13:50.694, Speaker A: And right now Lido is incentivizing liquidity. So the e to stake to eat ratio can be kind of the same. There's no reason for these two tokens to trade at par because you can't really withdraw the, like the ETH underlying stake deed. But you know, there's always going to be a buyer of a stake deed at some price because if someone is willing to wait until b continue withdrawal, withdrawals are live in March, April ish, they can redeem like whatever ETH is underlying stake deed. So you can argue that in post withdrawals, once withdrawals are actually enabled these tokens such as Lido, they can stop their emissions because post withdrawals, someone can buy, stake, deed, and then redeem their Eid immediately. Maybe not immediately, because I think the maximum withdrawals are gonna be like 40,000 eth per day. So it's not, it's gonna be like a slow trickling process.
00:13:50.694 - 00:14:41.594, Speaker A: So it's not perfect, right. There's like a time, there's like opportunity cost and whatnot. But basically, right, these projects can almost immediately end their emissions or have their emissions go down by over 50%, right? So less inflation, right, for the token second, the e staking rate is 13%. Expect 60% to 80% by end of 2023. And if all these LSD projects take a 10% fee on EID, then, you know, these projects are going to be making a bunch of money. Some of them will not be returning value to shareholders or token holders. But, you know, if you're bullish ETH and these projects denominate their profit in ETH, and you expect, you know, four to five x increase or four to six x increase in the amount of ETH that's going to enter the LSD space, then I think that's going to bring like, substantial tailwinds for all these projects.
00:14:41.594 - 00:15:28.876, Speaker A: And that's definitely a narrative, right? So it's going to be q one, q two. Definitely. I think that's going to be roughly the timeline on, like, when this will take effect. And obviously the question, oh, sorry, before I get into, like, the individual projects, you know, you might be asking, like, why does the withdrawal even matter? Right? And that's because, you know, there's like, currently there's illiquidity risk, right? Because if right now you take your EtH and you stake it with a liquid staker derivative, I mean, you get this liquid token back, like staked ETH. But as we saw with like, the three AC collapse, right, part of like, the growth for some of these liquid staking derivative tokens was created by leverage. So whenever there is like a mass liquidation event, you know, these staking derivatives can trade up, like trade much below par. I think staking traded like 7% below, like the Eth peg.
00:15:28.876 - 00:16:10.188, Speaker A: And, you know, there's like risk, right? If you stake it on the beacon chain. But I think post withdrawals, right, if it actually gets stripped around March or April, it's going to de risk this, like de risk, I guess, liquid staking derivatives significantly. So it should lead to a mass influx of more people. Just going to Lido, going to rocket pool going to fracs, staking their ETH, earning 5% and then, you know, using those tokens within Defi. So once those risks are, you know, gone, I just expect more people to stake their ETH. Okay, so that's kind of how it goes. I've talked, I mean not, not to nitpick on Aave, right? But I've talked about, I guess the Defi 1.0
00:16:10.188 - 00:16:40.158, Speaker A: is dead meme, right? And they've kind of been that, right? I mean they pumped a lot in 2020, right, in early 2021. And then, I mean this is the valuation against ether, right? So this is obviated ETH ratio. It's just like going down. You can argue it's kind of bottoming out. But you know, I don't even buy this thing right now. But you know, if you look at the ETH valuations for the other LSD tokens such as Lido, right. You know, I mean the tokenomics for Lido aren't that great, right? The majority of it goes to VC's and seed investors and like, you know, influencers.
00:16:40.158 - 00:17:11.651, Speaker A: But you know, it's, it's holding up relatively well, right? And that's cool. This is rocket poll, right? You know, it's kind of putting in higher highs and higher lows. That's pretty interesting. This is stake wise, right? Also putting in higher highs and higher lows kind of. So I expect. I mean, I'm not saying that's gonna go up in USD value because if the market takes a shit then, you know, there's. I mean, yeah, but I think there's a reasonable case to be made for all these LSD tokens to out form like 90% of crypto tokens.
00:17:11.651 - 00:18:04.960, Speaker A: Okay, so that's kind of the argument I'm making. Frax has had its boom and bust cycles because I mean, they used to be like a pure stablecoin project. Yeah, but you know, it's been, I mean, you know, it has like a similar chart to Lido as it, as in they're not like really losing value against ether. Ever since fraxed has been announced, because it was announced like roughly the end of May and ever since then it's been relatively stable. Maybe I'm nitpicking there, but basically I think LSE tokens, it's hard to bet on which one's going to win. Obviously right now Lido has like a significant share, but you know, with Lido there's going to be social and economic headwinds that they're going to be facing as people like feel less comfortable with Lido having so much of the share. So if people do rebalance all the eat that they have amongst these different types of liquid staking derivatives, I just think that a rising tide lifts all boats.
00:18:04.960 - 00:18:22.886, Speaker A: That's kind of the argument I'm making. A. Yeah, so let's talk about some of the tokens. I'm not gonna talk about FXS because I've talked about it before. Let's talk about Lido rocket pool and stakewise. Not gonna lie, I'm really still really early into like my research phase. So, you know, to be honest, I have no idea which one's gonna win.
00:18:22.886 - 00:19:30.560, Speaker A: I mean, Lido is probably gonna win, but, you know, which one's gonna be like the best investment of 2023? I have no idea, but I'll present some data in case, like, you're interested. But, you know, Lido, pure governance token, like I said, I think like 80% of the token, I mean, the majority token went to like, you know, investors, right. But you know, that's not necessarily a bad thing, right? Obviously it's not a great thing, but, you know, I guess they have a bunch of money in the treasury and they were able to create this amazing product, you know, and one thing I, I've observed is that because tokens are like down so bad, right, the opportunities in the public markets, you can argue that like, you know, they might be better than the opportunities in the private markets. Because in 2021, right, we saw all these like, you know, people like create their own vc firms, like get like exclusive rounds, you know, to like dump tokens and whatnot. And I guess, like that's where people like, you know, piled money in. But, you know, like, at this point, right, surely there has to be better opportunities in the public markets. So for example, right, Lido raised $73 million back in May of 2021 from paradigm.
00:19:30.560 - 00:19:55.784, Speaker A: And this was for 10% of the token supply. So their cost basis was seventy three cents. And back in August of 2022, Lido, I forget, like what exact price they sold at, but, you know, it was like roughly a dollar 45, right? They sold it to Dragonfly Capital. Right. Like roughly 1% of the Lido token supply. And, you know, it just means that Lido is extremely well capitalized. They can reinvest all that money into the business.
00:19:55.784 - 00:20:26.630, Speaker A: Right. So it's, they're very likely to lose at this point. But, you know, the round one cost base is $0.73, round two cost basis 145. By the way, these rounds have a one year lockup with, I think one year Cliff, I think people have been sharing. I don't have to start, but basically, you know, if you go to. If you look up Lido tokenomics, right, people think that the emissions for Lido have tapered off, but that's not really true because it doesn't take into account all these team treasury tokens that they sold to VC's and that are now starting to vest.
00:20:26.630 - 00:20:47.902, Speaker A: So just keep these in mind. But in the light, it was like roughly a dollar right now. So you can argue that you kind of getting in like relatively favorable valuations relative to the VC's. And you know, to be honest, if I were going to enter like a five year coma, I would probably hold Lido. Right? I don't hold Lido right now, obviously. But yeah, let's talk about stakewise. And then rocketball stick wise is kind of interesting.
00:20:47.902 - 00:21:20.358, Speaker A: They're like the lowest market cap out of all this and they're currently transitioning to stakewise v three. And I think I have a chart somewhere. Where's the chart that compares the valuations? Shoot, I don't have it right here. Well that's a bummer. But basically if you look at the PE ratios of stakewise and Lido, they're relatively the same relative to the amount of TVL that they have. So you can argue that maybe stakewise can be a good trade. But basically v three, they're going to introduce revenue share.
00:21:20.358 - 00:21:47.428, Speaker A: Okay, so that's kind of cool. They're going to introduce permissionless liquid staking for solo operators. That's really good. They're kind of following the footsteps of rocket pool. I'll provide a bunch of resources in the description below because, I mean, I don't want to bore your time or waste your time talking about all these things, but basically you can bond your stakewise with these different vaults. So you know, you're like taking on the risk, right. In case some Eth gets slashed.
00:21:47.428 - 00:22:25.690, Speaker A: But in return, there's going to be stakewise can earn, I guess, yield denominated in ETH, which could be cool. And yeah, I'm in a discord. It's fair to think that stakewise can be staked in a vault for a share of the protocol already for the Dow, and it's going to be used as insurance against slashing. That's kind of how it works. And Kiria, this guy, you know, he's on the team and he's assuming that it's gonna be roughly a 90% to 100% revenue. Sure, that's gonna stake wise. So no, maybe you can stake stakewise or Neil, right? But obviously you're taking on the risk for insurance against slasher.
00:22:25.690 - 00:23:07.314, Speaker A: But the thing is, we're roughly in month 20 of this vesting program, so it's kind of hockey stick. I mean, I mean, there's inflation, right? I mean, obviously. So it could be dumped, right? People can dump it, but, you know, just everything has different trade offs. And by the way, I'm not gonna talk about Rockapool because to be honest, like, I don't think I'm sophisticated enough to talk about Rockapool right now and like, you know, the merits of it. But you know, while everyone was celebrating their Christmas with their families, I was reading this paper by Mister Jasper, the family ghost. This was probably like one of the best papers I've read on liquid staking derivative tokens. And you know, Jasper, I mean, he's a paid contributor for Rocket poll, right? So he's biased, but he gives a pretty good objective.
00:23:07.314 - 00:23:28.802, Speaker A: I mean, it's biased, but an objective, I guess, overview of the LSD landscape. And if you really want to learn more about the merits of Lido versus rocket pole Frax stakewise, I really recommend people, you know, read this. So I hope I didn't spend too much time. Okay, 23 minutes. Okay. That was way more than I wanted to spend on that topic, but it's a. Okay, we'll keep going.
00:23:28.802 - 00:23:56.132, Speaker A: So I think lse tokens could be good. I don't own any right now, but I'll talk about my strategy. But I'll definitely be looking to accumulate some of these, if not all. Or maybe I'll just like buy a bunch of lighter or something, but I'll definitely like be looking to buy those things. So let's talk about the strategy. Right? It's like, okay, like cool tikey, like LSD tokens, right? Like, you know, can get me high, but like, how do I, you know, get high off of making money? Of course. You know, it's, it's, it's.
00:23:56.132 - 00:24:29.230, Speaker A: The markets are pretty difficult right now, so, you know, it's not going to be a fun strategy. But this is like definitely like the strategy that I'm employing right now. And then, you know, maybe when the facts change when like different things launch or, you know, the fund that, like, no, like, I don't know, like if the fundamentals for different types of things shift, then maybe I can reallocate. But right now my mindset post FTX is like, you know what? Like, obviously the markets can go down lower, right? There's like, there's like the Genesis risk through AC. I mean, sorry, not just genesis, grayscale, DCG. Right. I have no idea what's gonna happen to GBDC.
00:24:29.230 - 00:25:09.076, Speaker A: There could be, you know, like more, I don't know, like large players that go bust. But, you know, I think in the grand scheme of things, the amount of unknown unknowns in the system are gone. We all know, like, what the risks are and there could definitely be more sell pressure. But generally, right, I'm not really a trader, right. I don't really have an edge in trading, right. It's like, not that many people make money trading. So, you know, I like, instead of trading, right, I'll just try to profit from people speculating and trading, right? Collector swap fees, like borrowing fees and whatnot, and enter these LP positions, right? And think of these LLP positions as my crypto savings account.
00:25:09.076 - 00:25:51.232, Speaker A: I mean, I've brought this up many times before, right? So it's not really out of the norm. But basically what I've done is I've allocated more to these LP positions and my concept, or like, my. My thinking is using the yield farm and dumped it and then accumulate things that I actually like for 2023. Things I'm actually excited for, because right now there's so much uncertainty. And you can argue that the majority of the bid that's going to come into crypto is going to be in bitcoin ether. And if that's going to be the case, I mean, we can all agree that they're like the safest assets. So if I can just be exposed to them and have some downside protection via the stablecoin exposure, then, you know, like, it's something I'm comfortable holding for, you know, the next six to twelve months.
00:25:51.232 - 00:26:49.914, Speaker A: And then, you know, as the yield slowly comes in, I'll just like, take it, sell it, and then, you know, sell it into bitcoin ether or other altcoins that I'm excited for. So right now I'm thinking, like, I'll use the yield and, you know, I'll figure out like, which lst tokens I want to accumulate, but I'll probably like to start like buying, buying more of those with yield, right? So that's kind of how I think about it. So lb tokens, ask core positions, my. So I'm Gl petto pseudo swap pools. I think they're really, really good, right? They pay a lot, or, I mean, you know, tricypto pays less, you know, but, you know, they pay pretty well on convex use. The yield from LP so cumulative things I'm excited for. And if the market nukes, so let's say the market nukes and eth goes like 800 or something at that point, right? I'm probably gonna just bite the bullet, right? Just, you know, just really bite the bullet and just pull out ETh from my lp position, stake it with Lido or like whatever, right? LSD provider, and just, you know, just hope to God that the industry isn't going to be zero.
00:26:49.914 - 00:27:40.620, Speaker A: That's definitely how I'm thinking about it because, I mean, I was tracking this couple a couple days ago, but, you know, I've been looking at the stablecoin flows, right? So it's looking at the large centralized stable coins, USDC tether busd. I did it every two days manually, so I don't have to do it like, you know, like that much, but basically, right, like almost every couple of days, right, when he's leaving the ecosystem. And you know, if you think about it, the majority of coins in crypto is inflationary, right? Even ETH is inflationary. Bitcoin is inflationary, right? But if you think about these l one tokens, right? It's like vc circle drug, right? Cd investor circle drop, right? It's like, I don't really want to touch those. It doesn't mean that they can't go up, but no, like, I'd rather look to accumulate things with a more favorable supply schedule. Of course, the LSE tokens, they're all inflationary as well, but I, you know, they have different trade offs. Right.
00:27:40.620 - 00:28:10.900, Speaker A: And, yeah, I mean, you know, if you go to DPI, llama, stablecoin going down, so it's gonna be a really, really, really difficult environment for inflationary tokens to outperform. And if you're gonna buy something, right. Do it with a more favorable spot schedule. And that's why I think Eth is really, really good, right. It's post merge, it's, the inflation has dropped like dropped like a rock. And like, for me at this point, it's really hard for me to be bearish, eat. And also like the e to BTC ratio.
00:28:10.900 - 00:28:52.530, Speaker A: Yeah. Like looking at DeFI, looking at nfts, the amount of activity I still see right, within those two sectors, it's really hard for me to bear. To be bearish eat. So humbling about it, right? If it's inflationary, if it looks like a farm token, if it smells like a farm token, just dump it, right. It's going to be treated like a farm token, right? Yeah, just treat it like a farm token. So with that out of the way, let's talk about, you know, why we are the Alameda now, okay? And you might be asking yourself, like, take you the fuck does this mean? Of course, you know, I was thinking about, like, what type of content to make today, and I don't know, right? I'm like, you know what? Like, the market suck. Let's incorporate some comedy, right? So let's fucking go.
00:28:52.530 - 00:29:25.936, Speaker A: So the. The way. The way you think about it, it's like, you know, we all have a coming to age, right, in life. You know, you, like, discover things. The same applies to crypto, right? And you hit defi puberty when you buy a token and Alameda dumps it on you. Okay? This happened a lot in 2020, 2021. In parts of 2022, you know, you enter a farm because it's yielding 100%, and then you wake up tomorrow, and then Alameda dumped the token, and then the yield is, like, 10%.
00:29:25.936 - 00:30:10.040, Speaker A: Okay? We've all experienced it, and you kind of have to be dumped on for you to, like, understand how the entire market works, and it's all coming of age. But. But the thing is, Alameda, they're gone now, right? They're blown the fuck out. They're gone, right? That guy's in jail. So who is gonna take on their responsibility to farm and dump these farm tokens? It has to be us, right? It has to be the humble farm army. It is our chance to beat Alameda, right? We are the Alameda now, okay? Like, I actually bought this hat on Amazon to really, you know, push this pointer, okay? And I shit you not. I looked up Alameda research farm and dump on Google, right? Google images.
00:30:10.040 - 00:30:35.300, Speaker A: And this is, like, one of the first things that popped up on Google, right? I'm serious. You can. You can do it right now, right? Pause the video. Do it right now. And this man is no other than curve market cap, right? You know, a fellow, he's a curve Nazi, right? And I'm subscribed to his YouTube. I'm in his discord. I respect this man a lot, you know? But over a year ago, he wrote this.
00:30:35.300 - 00:31:18.060, Speaker A: He made me this video called dumping dumpers, right? It's like, alameda is dumping my token, right? It's like, damn, this sucks. I just thought it was funny, you know? But no, we have to look in the mirror and say, you know what? We are the Alameda now, right? Like, we have to farm and dump these tokens, right? We have to take the liquidity on chain and just extract value out of it. Because if we're not doing it, then who is, right? Then someone else is gonna do it. It's like, might as well do it now, right? And then if money comes back, then we can go risk on and sing hallelujah kumbaya. But, well, money is leaving the ecosystem, right? We just have to farm and dump these things, right? Like this is farm and dump. Farm and dump, right? This, you know, it's kind of going back on this point, right? Lb tokens is core positions. I earned a yield.
00:31:18.060 - 00:31:38.094, Speaker A: I dump it, right? And then I buy things that isn't a farm token, or what I think is less of a farm token. Okay, so no, like, you know, let's, let's get together, like, let sing with me, right? Like farm and dump. Farm and dump. Farm, man. Dumped curve. Dump it. Avalanche.
00:31:38.094 - 00:32:13.530, Speaker A: Dump it, right? Just dump these inflationary tokens. Just dump it, right? Like, curve smells like a farm token. Yeah, it's a farm token. Avalanche. Like, you know, it's definitely, you know, stinks of a farm token. So just, just dump these things, right? And, you know, if the fundamental shifts just, you know, maybe buy it later, I don't really know, but, you know, just, you know, ulp, right? They pay you in these tokens for a reason, right? Like, you know, like, you can't really realize these yields unless you sell them. So that's kind of how I'm approaching or, I mean, that's kind of how I'm approaching markets.
00:32:13.530 - 00:33:09.080, Speaker A: But no, it kind of works for 2023 and beyond as well. You know, I'm still gonna have cash, but, you know, my core position isn't really cash, it's LP positions, if that makes any sense. And I really recommend people to, like, be humble with the markets right now. I mean, we've all been humbled by markets, obviously. But if you think about the people left on chain, right, like the majority of retail has left, right? The people left on chain are the sharks, okay? We all know what we're doing, right? Like, we all try to like, catch pumps, cell pumps, or whatever, but I don't really do that anymore because I am fully aware that the people left on chain know what they're doing. So simple things like, you know, arbitrum, Dex pump. Like, it's not going to work anymore, okay? Like, everyone knows the game, right? Everyone knows that, you know, you can like it pumps sometimes, and then you can like, dump it, right? But you know, if everyone knows that, then, you know, these pumps will be less sustained.
00:33:09.080 - 00:33:37.870, Speaker A: Then you have to pay gas, you have to pay slippage, you have to pay fee. I mean, it's really hard to win here. So I really recommend everyone to just be longer term minded with everything that they do in crypto and just try to play the long game instead of, like, trying to, you know, catch pumps every single week because it's very unlikely to work. If you can, then, you know, go for it. But, yeah, it's hard for me to do. Yeah, I talked about before, and. Yeah, like, liquid staking, derivatives, coinbase at a discount.
00:33:37.870 - 00:33:54.946, Speaker A: I think it's good. I like sudo, I like GMX, you know, lido options plays, and pudgy penguins. Yeah, I'll talk about pudgy penguins later. Um, yeah, and if you're buying something, prioritize those with favorable supply schedules. Heavy vc bags. Right. I mean, you know, if it smells like a vc bag, it probably is a vc bag.
00:33:54.946 - 00:34:08.466, Speaker A: Yeah. So that being said, let's talk about on chain sipcoin yields and why they're not that great, right. They're just, like, not that great. Right. It's like, aave pays you 2%, 1% then, and you can go to fidelity and earn, like, 4.5% on cash. Right.
00:34:08.466 - 00:34:27.738, Speaker A: It doesn't really make any sense to deploy, you know, stable coins, like, on, like, relatively dangerous strategies, of course, you know, putting into curve earning, like, eight to 10%. Right. I think. I think that's totally fine, but generally. Right, like, you know, the risk word really isn't worth it. And, like, risk adjusted return terms, of course. Yeah.
00:34:27.738 - 00:34:59.158, Speaker A: Like I said, the boring yield is fine, but generally, I mean, you know, it's hard to. Because everything about crypto and Defi is, like, about incentives. And if people don't have an incentive to, like, bridge fiat onto. Onto the chain and use it in defi, then, you know, it's really, really difficult to maintain that TVL. I don't really think that, you know, defi TVL is gonna go down like a rock. I think there's enough things to do on the. On the blockchain, right, to, you know, make, like, an income and, like, you know, actually, like, make money.
00:34:59.158 - 00:35:23.992, Speaker A: But those strategies are more sophisticated, and most people don't want to deal with, like, learning new things. Yeah. And, you know, like, I was. I was actually, like, telling my girlfriend, hey, like, you know, like, you can actually earn, like, almost 5% on fidelity. And I was like, damn. Like, I'm in crypto and defi, and I'm, like, shilling fucking fidelity yields. Like, I don't deserve to put this.
00:35:23.992 - 00:35:40.100, Speaker A: Put this hat on, right. It's. It's. It's really a shame. So the idea is for, like, save coin chains or, sorry, say, born yields. Unless there's, like, significant upside, it's probably not worth putting it. Putting your capital in there.
00:35:40.100 - 00:36:07.368, Speaker A: And Mister Noodles, right? He's the founder of Raytrade. He makes a pretty interesting point. I kind of do agree with him. Like, I think the next $4 to come back into crypto, like, I think someone has to make some stable coin product that can actually yield, sustainable yield that beats the treasury rate. The cds. It's difficult, right. And people are trying to build, like, delta neutral vaults, which I'm not a huge fan of, but at least they're trying, right? And we'll see if it works.
00:36:07.368 - 00:36:29.236, Speaker A: And, you know, there's actually this project called Umami, which is, like, up only against either. I mean, I've talked to the team. I read the white paper. I mean, I've done all the work. I'm still kind of skeptical about delta neutral vaults. I know they did, like, back tests and stuff, but, you know, it remains to be seen. But, you know, if this gains, like, 100 million tv all probably like eight bit.
00:36:29.236 - 00:36:42.300, Speaker A: Right? Like $100 or something. Right. It's like, at that point right there, it's probably worth the buy. They're trying to create, like, a more transparent block buy slash celsius type of product. And they're trying to cater more towards institutions. They have a account with the circle. Right.
00:36:42.300 - 00:37:05.174, Speaker A: So, you know, the direct, direct on ramp is much easier. But, you know, basically, the point is, like, most bitcoin products just not that great for me. It's like, yeah, yeah, I'll talk about shell protocol, which, to be honest, like, I'm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have some dollars in here. I think it's pretty cool. Let's.
00:37:05.174 - 00:37:19.286, Speaker A: Let's talk about it. So it's. This is defi infra on arbitram with zero adoption so far. So, you know, it remains to be seen. But they've been live since 2020. They have a trailer bits audit. You know, from what I've heard, like, you have to pay, like, six figures to get this audit.
00:37:19.286 - 00:37:45.510, Speaker A: So for them to get a trailer bits audit, which is, like, arguably the best auditing firm in crypto, they're probably not going to rug. Right. They're probably not going to be exploited. And the teams in it for the longer haul, they have docs, founders, pre launch, and all the work that they've done before launch is very thoughtful. So I think it has potential until now, return too. And you can put stable coins in there, earn some yield, not real yield, I mean I'll talk about it, right. It's a speculative stablecoin farm.
00:37:45.510 - 00:38:34.486, Speaker A: I have a bunch of slides on this but I'm not gonna like, I think I'm like over like my time threshold so. But you know, they're trying to create this thing called the ocean which is kind of like an accounting system that introduces gas efficiencies to new DeFi primitives. They have this produce amm that utilizes this accounting, this accounting tech followed by an NFT AmM and hopefully more teams can build on in the future. So Kenny, right, the founder. The base layer of the show is a protocol smart contract we call the ocean. It's the accounting hub which all the financial programs are built on top of. And the idea is, you know, whenever you participate in like some complex smart contract such as you know, GMX, Convex or like some Dex aggregator, sometimes you pay like a lot of money and fees because you're calling all these different, different smart contracts.
00:38:34.486 - 00:39:08.534, Speaker A: And the argument is if every defi primitive can share the same accounting hub, then that's going to introduce gas efficiencies for everyone involved, right? For the smart contract developers and for the users. And it kind of goes over the gas savings there like some pink and poop brown lines. And they have this chart here, right, Alice here. It does not look like an Alice, but stuff like this, stuff like that. So the thing is, I would not be interested in that. I would not buy this token if it was liquidity. I'm only in it because of the farm.
00:39:08.534 - 00:39:29.358, Speaker A: It's an arbitram. I think more capital will flow into arbitram. But given that they're, given the team's history, their strong audits results, they're investors. I feel comfortable farming in staples. And maybe, you know, my couple million shell points end up being worth something. Who knows? And you know, they have kind of this interesting lore. So I'll talk about like how to earn these points.
00:39:29.358 - 00:40:06.438, Speaker A: You do have to pay money to earn, which is, could be a turn off, but you know, but no, reading this, I thought it was worth it. So they have this thing called the tale of Bro Kwan's booty and basically you have all these NFts that you can buy in order for you to increase your quota. And if you ever to go to the website, they have a pretty interesting storyline. I'm not going to go over the story because this is a overview video. But for example, if you wanted farmer staples, you can have to buy one of these, one of these expanders, right? And it gives you a quota. So this gives. Let's take a look at this, right? Expander, Chad, quota increase of this.
00:40:06.438 - 00:40:31.924, Speaker A: So, you know, it allows you to earn yield on up to $5,000 of the lp, up to $5,000 on USDC, up to five e and shell. USDC is like kind of like wrapped USDC, right? It's kind of like wrapped either, right? Very. I mean, yeah, like, you know, it's just a wrapped version of these I coins. There's like all these boosters. You can increase your yield, to be honest. Like it's not, probably not worth buying these things. It's only worth it.
00:40:31.924 - 00:41:06.910, Speaker A: Not really worth it. There's also like these nfts, kind of cool ponzu sauce, right? I love Ponzu's in real life, right? The actual sauce, the japanese sauce. They have some investors like Stani angels and like, you know, these VC's and, you know, shellpoints, right? Basically your LP for the A and M, and you earn these shellpoints, these shell points. You can't really do anything with it. But there was a governance proposal that passed in early November and it's going to be factored into the shell airdrop. I think it's most likely happening in January or this February or sometime in Q one. I think maybe actually, maybe probably not in January.
00:41:06.910 - 00:41:48.376, Speaker A: So it's like February or March. So, you know, like you have to buy these nfts to earn these points. I have no idea what these points are going to be for, but I think that, you know, in this type of market, I think investing in like, infrastructure makes more sense than like trying to buy like inflationary farm tokens. So I'm just like farming this, right? Like, who knows? And you know, like someone once said, hey, like, you know, like if you're deploying stables, right, it's like instead of like earning like 8%, you might as well earn like imaginary points, right? Like imaginary yield, right? Imaginary APR. Because I could be farming this for like 10% or I could also be farming it for like a million percent APY, right? Depending on like, what the token ends up doing. I think. I think.
00:41:48.376 - 00:42:23.996, Speaker A: I think the most likely outcome is that I'm probably farming this like a 6% APR and I'll be very disappointed. Who knows, right? I'm definitely a dreamer at this point, right? I'm in it for tech, so do your own research. But that's what I'm doing. So let's lastly talk about pudget penguins and suicide pools. I mentioned I want to get into NFts more. And you know, throughout all my research, after buying some illiquid jpegs on avalanche and getting wrecked on that, I decided, you know what, I'm gonna go back to the roots, right? Go back to Ethereum. And I bought myself a pudgy penguin, right? Look at this guy.
00:42:23.996 - 00:42:59.636, Speaker A: So cute, right? Look at that mohawk, right? And I'm really bullish. Pudgy penguins. It's hard for me to explain, like in a rational manner, but I think Luca, who took over the project, definitely knows what he's doing. And I really like his attitude of just like not being purely reliant on royalties. All the NFT founders that I've talked to that actually are trying to create something of value. They understand that royalties are going to trend towards zero, right? Because market inefficiency or market efficiencies will take over and, you know, it's not enforceable on chain. I think for like all these large collections, royalties will be near zero.
00:42:59.636 - 00:43:35.464, Speaker A: But like for like one on ones and like your actual art, right, people can charge 5%, but I think that's totally fine. I think that. I think that's gonna be like the equal every at some point. But basically, yeah, basically he's trying to create ip, he's trying to create partnerships with retailers in the real world and, you know, he's currently raising money to do so. And I really like. You kind of have to listen to his interviews to really understand like why I really buy into it. But, you know, I think NFTs is like digital identity, like digital culture, branding.
00:43:35.464 - 00:44:15.770, Speaker A: And I really think he knows what he's doing there. And if you look at the floor prices of these pudgy penguins, I mean, obviously this is in east terms and in dollar terms they're kind of down bad. But in these terms, it's like putting in pretty bullish price action, don't you think? So I bought one and there's also, there's, there's like, I'm not sure what's not loading. Let me refresh real quick. But yeah, basically I bought one and what the hell, it's not loading. But you know what, let's go to uniswap because it's probably better. There's also these pudgy rods and these low pudgies and I swept the floor on them, right? And they're also putting in a pretty bullish price action.
00:44:15.770 - 00:44:57.148, Speaker A: And what I did, let's go here is I swept some rocks and little pudgies. So, you know, obviously, nfts have been a speculative vehicle to just buy things and pay royalties and hopefully goes up to offset those royalties right now, like the bull market. But obviously, right now, if you think about the NFT landscape, it's pretty harsh if you're an NFT trader, because the fees are ridiculous. Open C takes 2.5%, and then the creator is one 5%. How do you make money? It's almost impossible. So I think the best way to, at least for me, right, I mean, keep in mind I'm like a novice.
00:44:57.148 - 00:45:32.862, Speaker A: I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm, like, buying these. You know, I swept a bunch of these rods, these digital fishing rods for like, $600. But basically, like, the. The way I'm thinking about it is, like, you know, I want to get into nfts. I think they have pretty good value, and if I want to accumulate nfts, I might as well earn yield on them, right? I might as well. And I'm not talking about, like, the ponzonomic yield of, you know, the project team, like, you know, giving you more nfts to speculate on with 10% royalties or, like, introducing, like, a new token where you stake your NFT to earn token.
00:45:32.862 - 00:46:02.172, Speaker A: I mean, that doesn't make any sense, right? But, like, actual, like, no revenue, right? Actual yield by being an LP. So, yeah, so I swept, actually, let me just share this. Okay. Let me refresh this to make sure it works. So basically what I did was I swept 15 pudgies, or the little pudgies, not the big one, right? The little pudgies for 5.16 eth. Okay.
00:46:02.172 - 00:46:38.934, Speaker A: I did that, as you see here, and I paired it with 3.918. Okay? So, yeah, I mean, you can. You can see the math, right? So, you know, I put nine, eight worth or value in the little pudgy E Lp, and I did the same for rods. I swept ten rods, you know, I forgot when, but for like, four point. Yeah, like, whatever. Basically, I swept some rods, I swapped some ether, sorry, low pudgies, and I paired it with ether, and I made an LP pool on pseudoswap, as you can see here. Okay, let's see.
00:46:38.934 - 00:47:02.102, Speaker A: Let me just refresh both. As you can see, I'm very, very prepared for this video. So this is my pool, right? Feel free to look it up. You can do whatever you want. And I set a 3% fee, right? So every. Every time someone buys or sells with this pool, I earn 3% of the fees and my delta is 3.5%. So each times one buys or sells an NFT, the price will be lowered or increased by 3.5%.
00:47:02.102 - 00:47:39.260, Speaker A: Okay, and this is a pure amm, right? So I'm providing liquidity anyone can buy or sell into the pool. And because amm, I think, you know, I can offer more competitive rates than like Opensea wic, whatever, right? Sudo takes a 0.5% fee. So basically if you swap from here, you pay 3.5%. And fortunately, Mister Chris Lipinski from the variant fund made this really nice dashboard that kind of lets you track how many fees you can earn on these LP's. And this pool has been live for eleven days and I've made 0.43 eth so far in fees.
00:47:39.260 - 00:48:30.364, Speaker A: And there's like, you know, maybe my real p and l is a little bit lower because of implemented loss, right? I'm selling upside, but basically, you know, like I said, I paired, I put 15 ether, right? And, sorry, 15 nfts and 3.9 ether in here. And then people have been buying and selling, right, these dots at various price points. The cool thing is because the NFT price has been stable to slightly going up recently. Like I'm collecting all these transaction fees while I guess like my LP tokens go up, right? Because like think of it like, like this, right? This. I mean, sure these are jpegs, right? And like what the hell? These are pictures, but you know, they're like altcoins with pictures. So you might as well, like, what you can do is you can LP provide liquidity and charge like pretty like ridiculous fees, like egregious fees, like three to 4%, but people will trade it because, you know, opensea charges 2.5%
00:48:30.364 - 00:48:59.328, Speaker A: and creators charge 5%. So if you can just like undercuts like those fees, then you're gonna just be printing on like this l this lp position, if that makes any sense. I know it's kind of hard to wrap your head against, but just imagine this is like uniswap LP, right? I mean, it works. I did the same for rods, right? I bought ten rods prior to what? Some either. I charge a whole 4% fee, to be honest. I'm like expensive experimenting. I think it's better to charge 4%, right? Because people are willing to pay 4% to you.
00:48:59.328 - 00:49:21.904, Speaker A: So like might as well charge them more. You can probably charge 5% to be honest, because. Yeah, like Opensea is ridiculous, but in a dismayed 0.48 in fees and whatnot. And you can argue that if you're buying an NFT. Like, you know, like, people are looking for like a, like 100 x, right? They want the next board, a BJ, love. But, like, what are the chances is that you're going to buy a boarded gyoc love, right? It's like, very, very low.
00:49:21.904 - 00:49:53.012, Speaker A: I think a more sustainable way to make money with NFTs is to just buy collections of things that you think are not scams that you think will hold their value or slightly go up in e terms, create an LP pair, charge people 4%, and then people will, like, just salivate to trade on your pool because it's just more competitive. I kind of, you know, I did the math, right? In eleven days, I earned 0.43 in fees. So that's an effective APR. Roughly 157, right? That's cool for rods. In six days, I made 0.48 e.
00:49:53.012 - 00:50:19.210, Speaker A: That's an effective APR of that much. And I mean, like, this is, like printing, right? I mean, it's actually. It's absolute printing. And I'm definitely be looking to LP for more projects later down the line. I might LP for pudgy penguins at some point when I feel like I have the balls to do so because that's a lot of money. But, you know, at least for this, right? I started out with, like, some, like, you know, single digit either. I felt a little bit more comfortable with that.
00:50:19.210 - 00:50:50.780, Speaker A: But it's pretty cool because, you know, for the rods, right? Like, that's me, right, the floor. I'm pretty competitive and I don't have to worry about, like, keeping up with, like, the price action because I sell p and then the price will fluctuate manually or not? Not manually, but automatically depending on the market demand. If you go to lopudgies, right? Am I the 0.43 floor? No. Okay, my. Okay, my price is 443. So I am no longer the floor.
00:50:50.780 - 00:51:12.670, Speaker A: Like, right when I started doing this, like, a lot of people were like, oh, my God, like, I'm gonna copy your position. So people have been, like, undercutting my fees and whatnot, you know, so, like, this is my right. Feel free to buy this if you want to write and pay me 3%. Okay. By the way, you don't have to, but, you know, just generally, like, it's. I think it's pretty interesting, actually. Hold up, let me just clear this.
00:51:12.670 - 00:51:57.096, Speaker A: You know, like, for a lot of these, like, floor PFE projects, like, that trade, like, fungible tokens, I think sudo pools makes sense, right? Because, you know, like, sellers and opensea, like, you know, they have to pay 5%. They have to pay opensea money. It's like, it's going to be really, really difficult for them to compete, like in price terms. So what you can do is you can, like, be your own marketplace, right? You can just be an LP charge for three or 4%. And I think if I do open a pool, new pool, I'll probably charge four or 5% or 4.5%. I think, you know, charging as much as you can is like the better way because you can make way more fees because I made 0.48 here in six days, whereas I made 0.43
00:51:57.096 - 00:52:38.194, Speaker A: in eleven days because, you know, I only take 3%. But, you know, I still have a bunch of trades. I mean, there's a trade off, right? I mean, like, if you charge lower fees, you might get more volume. To be honest, I'm not that sophisticated, so I have no idea what I'm doing. And maybe I'm just lucky here, but I thought that was kind of cool, right? Like, I feel like this is like a real way to actually earn money on nfts without, like, hoping for the team to, like, airdrop you new nfts, right? Or like, you know, waiting for the team to airdrop your tokens, right? It's like, well, please team, like, you know, give me free money, right? I mean, it's not going to work that way anymore. I think in 2023, if you want to make, like real money right, from the market, you have to learn how to be an LP. I definitely think so.
00:52:38.194 - 00:53:26.580, Speaker A: And I'll talk about uniswap on b three later. And also, I guess, Cito, they raised like 12.28 million recently. So hopefully that can go towards improving the UI, Ux and more money on marketing because their marketing is really, really bad right now. So, you know, to wrap this video up, you know, I mentioned this at the top of the video, but like I said, I think, you know, the days of easy yield is gone. Okay? Like, if you got into defi because of, like, you know, high APIs and you want that to come back, then, you know, you might have to unsubscribe and come back in 2024, right? Like, that's kind of the reality. If you want to, like, actually make money from the markets, that's not like from trading, right, but like more from, like fees being paid by people.
00:53:26.580 - 00:54:15.704, Speaker A: You have to maybe, maybe you don't have to. But I think the best way is by participating in these automated market makers because if you can be an LP, right? And like, you know, specify what people, like, what fees you charge for people to speculate on these tokens. Then you know that people are actually paying you to, you know, provide working capital, right? That's kind of how businesses work, right? And I think, you know, you, like, if you don't really know how concentrated liquidity works as we approach 2023, then I think you have some work to do. I think a lot of uniswap, a lot of people, like, fud uniswap, because, like, people that provide liquidity don't make money. Broken product. But, you know, I think those are people that don't fully understand LP ing. They probably never LP before.
00:54:15.704 - 00:54:43.252, Speaker A: I mean, most of them, right? Like some people, I mean, it's not perfect, but I still think Unity b three is an amazing product. And if you think about, like, how it's designed, like, trying to. Trying to recreate an order book on chain via constant, I mean, that's such a. Such an amazing product. And, you know, sudo sop is trying to do the same for nfts. And I think, you know, these, like, univ three and psilocybin to be the best way to earn yield on non majors. Okay.
00:54:43.252 - 00:55:06.320, Speaker A: Like bitcoin, ether, right? You can, like, LP, like, track crypto, gop, earn yield. That's really easy. But if you want to earn yield on, like, Lido, like, what are you gonna do, right? Like, stake it on something? Like, no, that's not really gonna work. So let's actually go over. I've already gone through the pseudosop example, right? That's kind of cool. Let's talk about Lido. Okay, so there's this really cool tool called revert finance.
00:55:06.320 - 00:55:38.962, Speaker A: I guess I'll talk about sleepwise too, here. So revert finance kind of goes over, I guess, top v three positions. I already filtered it, right? You can go to the filter, you can select two assets, and then look at the current uni v three positions, because all unity v three positions are nfts, so they're not fungible. And if you're unsophist, maybe. Okay, like, I'm. So I'm unsophisticated, right? I don't really do uni v three, but I know how it works. So maybe I'm not, like, at a position to talk about this.
00:55:38.962 - 00:56:23.502, Speaker A: But if you do want to, I guess, copy current positions, what you can do is go to rework finance. And, you know, I recommend looking at the, like, the, like, LP positions with, like, a high age, I guess, because, you know, it's going to be a low likelihood that your LP position is going to go out of range, because if it's out of range, you're not going to make money. So for example, if you want to buy Lido, right, to speculate on like the LSD narrative, you can. I guess I'll click on this top one. Because this thing has been printing money. So this thing has been going been around for almost two years and it's up $600,000 in USD. It's made 300k in eth, 300k in Lido.
00:56:23.502 - 00:56:44.760, Speaker A: And let's wait for this load, right. It's providing ranges between 0.003 to 0.0022 lido ratio, right. So these blue, purple dots. So if you just want to practice, right, you can just copy this person's position and then expect to earn like roughly 64 69%. Aprenne, you can argue that, you know, you can.
00:56:44.760 - 00:57:12.976, Speaker A: This person could probably make the ranges tighter because, you know, you know, it's not really going above like 0.0018 or something. I mean, it's hard to kind of look at it, but you know, you can kind of copy farm these positions. I think that's kind of cool. And I think, you know, for like larger cap altcoins like Lido, I think LP Renov three makes sense for things like stakewise, right, that I talked about. It's a little bit difficult because equise is like a really low marking up and it's so volatile and it's gonna be pretty difficult. Okay.
00:57:12.976 - 00:57:34.864, Speaker A: It's gonna be pretty difficult to increase. Like this person pulled $24 worth of assets, I guess, in this ratio. And it's already up hundred dollars. Right. Maybe it's not that scalable, but you know, I guess this position is printing. I thought I clicked on something else, but yeah, let me just look at this. This thing's only been around for 1.5
00:57:34.864 - 00:57:45.678, Speaker A: days, so. Okay. And it's already out of range. So, you know, it's kind of hard. Right. Unity B three. But I really recommend people like think about it, utilize these pools.
00:57:45.678 - 00:58:18.410, Speaker A: I mean, one of the reasons I don't try not to do uni v three versus is because it kind of doxes my portfolio and I kind of don't want to dox my portfolio, right. Because I try to be as transparent as I can with all my positions and that's a really tight range. I'm not sure if that's going to work. But anyways, that's kind of it. We're being waiting for 58 minutes. I hope there was some value I kind of rambled on, you know, kind of rambled on about a bunch of things. I didn't think I drank enough coffee today.
00:58:18.410 - 00:58:50.402, Speaker A: But I guess the takeaway is, you know, I think the state teeth benchmark is really hard to beat for new projects. I think they're going to struggle. So more teeth will consolidate towards, like, the safer protocols or, you know, even if they're new, right? They're gonna have, like, a docs founder. They need to have, like, a docs founder with a strong vc backing or something in order for them to attract liquidity. But that doesn't. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna be, like, a good investment, right, for the token. And now that Alameda is blowing the fuck out, right? We are the Alameda now.
00:58:50.402 - 00:59:25.394, Speaker A: We have to be the ones farming, dumping, and then with the yield, maybe things that you actually like. It's not fun. It's not sexy, but actually it's kind of fun, right? Like, I mean, once a week, I look at my crops and I, you know, I. Some sustainable farming, and then I take my harvest and I sell it to, like, the local market, and then I, like, buy, I don't know, like, more coffee or something, right? It's kind of like real life on chain stablecoin yields. Not that great. So if you're going to farm something with stable coins, has to be something with upside. In my opinion, protocol and farming probably not gonna be worth much.
00:59:25.394 - 01:00:09.238, Speaker A: But, you know, I'm a dreamer, and I think, you know, getting into nfts at the top didn't make any sense. People have been making fun of me for getting into nfts right now, but I think, you know, like, when else are we gonna get into nfts other than, like, when the markets are, like, down so much? So that's. I'm kind of experimenting with different types of nfts, like, which one to buy, which one to LP. I'm personally a fan of the pudgy penguin ecosystem. I'm probably going to be utilizing all my profits from my pseudo pools to accumulate more pudgies. And, you know, I shared how you can earn yield on certain nfts if you are comfortable enough. Being a liquidity provider, I don't think it's that complicated.
01:00:09.238 - 01:00:20.860, Speaker A: I can actually kind of go over it if you want to, so. So you can create a new pool. I want to earn nfts. I want to deposit ether. Oh. 0.69. I did not even plan that.
01:00:20.860 - 01:00:30.760, Speaker A: 0.69. And. Okay, pudgy penguins. Okay. I don't have enough, obviously, but let's. I don't know what the pudgy four is. Let's see.
01:00:30.760 - 01:00:44.464, Speaker A: Pudgy penguin, 5.23. That's up a lot. Let's just use round numbers. Actually, no, let's see this. 5.23. Was it this tab? Yeah. Starting.
01:00:44.464 - 01:00:56.820, Speaker A: Starting price. 5.23. If you go to Opensea, the creator fee is 5%, open c date is 2.5%. So, you know, if you. If you just have to compete with that. Right. So I like exponential curves.
01:00:56.820 - 01:01:21.266, Speaker A: And let's talk about the fees first. Let's charge 4.5%. And my delta, let's say, is 4%. Right? So every time someone buys or sells an NFT, the price will just by 4%. Buy it. Sell up to, let's say, five penguins. And I want to provide enough exit liquidity for people by buying off the three penguins, for example.
01:01:21.266 - 01:01:42.714, Speaker A: So if I want to create this pool, I need to deposit this much Ethan, that much penguins, and my curve looks like this. So I'm going to be willing to buy three penguins at the price 4.6054.428 and 4.258. Right. Because this is an amm, right. I'm not, like, manually bidding things. And if people buy my nfts, I'll buy the first one at 5.23,
01:01:42.714 - 01:01:56.066, Speaker A: second at 5.439, etcetera. Right. And I'll be fully out of my punchy pen. Wins at 6.118. And if, you know, if you want to sell at a higher price, then maybe you can, like, up this to, like, 10%. Right.
01:01:56.066 - 01:02:18.880, Speaker A: And then, you know, you'll sell your last one at the 7.65. Who knows, right? I mean, I have no idea. Do not listen to me because I am down money. So thank you, guys for watching. I guess bear markets are rebuilding, so I created this new website, humble Farm army. You know, feel free to go through this if you're interested. Kind of goes over my paid discord, to be honest.
01:02:18.880 - 01:02:46.108, Speaker A: It's a bear market, so, you know, for most people, I think it's better to, like, reinvest capital into the markets than, you know, joining this. But if you want to take your knowledge to the next level, meet, like, a couple hundred people that actually care about defi. Right. Fundamentally driven people, it could be worth it for you. But to be honest, right, maybe buy more, eat right. That might be better. So thank you, guys watching, and see you guys in 2023.
01:02:46.108 - 01:02:50.980, Speaker A: I'll try to make more videos next year. Yeah. Bye bye. Have a good one.
