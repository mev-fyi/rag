00:00:00.240 - 00:00:07.130, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Tyke here, and welcome to episode 19 of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I have with me Joe McCann. How are you doing today?
00:00:07.470 - 00:00:09.170, Speaker B: I'm great. Thanks for having me.
00:00:09.470 - 00:00:19.450, Speaker A: So we all know you as, I guess, the Michael Saylor bonk, as your name says. But can the audience get a brief intro on how you got into crypto and what you do now?
00:00:20.350 - 00:01:00.960, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I've been a technologist and a trader going on 24 plus years now. I flip flopped my career between tech and trading. So I used to trade on Wall Street. A long time ago, I flipped back to tech kind of full time, and then I was a CTO at the top ad agency in New York City. I started my own open source enterprise infrastructure called Node Source, which was the node JS company bootstrapped. It, raised a bunch of venture capital, sold in 2019, and I got into crypto in 2016.
00:01:00.960 - 00:01:57.558, Speaker B: But I was busy running a company at the time as CEO, and got in much more deeply, I would say, in the 2017 run, because it was just insane. As a trader, I felt like crypto is this renaissance for traders, because when I was trading on the desk years prior, I left Wall street, like, 2007, I left because I was like, all this stuff is machines and algorithms, so, you know, clicking a mouse is not really gonna beat Citadel. So that's why I went into tech full time. But then when I got back into, or when I started to get into crypto and trading, it was. It wasn't dominated by, you know, Renaissance technologies and de Shaw and all these kind of high frequency trading or algorithmic firms. It was just people around the. The world trading crypto.
00:01:57.558 - 00:03:19.196, Speaker B: And so that also kind of dovetailed into my broader view around crypto, which was crypto, to me, feels like the open source philosophy being applied to finance, because it's transparent, it's open, it's freely available, it's permissionless, all of these things. And as I was running this open source enterprise infrastructure company, it just kind of, like, pattern matched a little bit, and thought to myself, man, this has to be the future of money, the future of finance, the future of trading and value exchange. And so in 2018, I actually resigned as the CEO of the company, moved into the chairman of the board role, which was a much easier gig. And I spent some of my free time writing algorithmic and systematic trading strategies for crypto, as one does. And that was great, because one of the things that also stood out to me about that was unlike Wall street, if you want to go into Tradfi and you want to say you have an idea for some systematic trading strategy? Well, you have to set up a prime brokerage account. You probably need a Bloomberg subscription. You probably got to face Wedbush and open up a CME account or theres all of these hoops that you have to jump through that really are just ways of gatekeeping.
00:03:19.196 - 00:03:54.148, Speaker B: And crypto was the opposite of that. There was basically no gatekeeping. You just write your software and connect to APIs and go. That was really an eye opening moment for me. This guy named John Burbank, whos the founder of Passport capital, which is a well known institutional hedge fund in San Francisco, caught wind of what I was doing and recruited me to come build out his quant systematic trading desk for crypto. In 2018, I did that, but then in 2019, I left, not because of passport, but because it's basically impossible to trade crypto at a us hedge fund. So I said, look, it's not you, it's me.
00:03:54.148 - 00:04:20.024, Speaker B: I want to continue to pursue this and just do it on my own personal balance sheet. So I did that. And 2019 was also a really good time to start doing R and D into web3. It was bear market. And so I started tracking the Ethereum community. I started writing a few solidity apps because I had all this experience previously at node source around open source and understanding what makes developers tick. I wanted to track these developer ecosystems.
00:04:20.024 - 00:05:09.580, Speaker B: And that also led me very early on to Solana. Solana was taking a very, totally different approach to solving for blockchain and what they were trying to accomplish. And meanwhile, Microsoft caught wind of my free agency and recruited me to join their cloud and AI organization. And so they hired me and they said, look, they said, we want to hire you, but we don't know what to do with you. And I said, how about I help you not miss the next big thing? And so I did a lot of like M and a work, corporate dev work, strategy work, working with Microsoft Ventures on the ventures stuff. And before I left in 2021, I basically drafted the entire like web3 strategy for Microsoft, delivered to Satia, Della and the senior leadership team. And it was for every line of business, not just the cloud and AI organization.
00:05:09.580 - 00:05:45.400, Speaker B: And I said, bye, I'm going to go start my own fund. And the reason I went to go start my own fund is I have a very close friend of mine named Steve Jang, who I've known for years. He's a very, very successful vc, was also entrepreneur. First money in a coinbase and Uber and all this good stuff. Just got added to Midas list for the second time in a row today. Very legit guy said, look, Joe, you're the only guy in crypto that really understands the technology, but also knows how to trade, and you're not out of fund. So, like, come run a fund, a crypto fund at Kindred.
00:05:45.400 - 00:06:21.158, Speaker B: And I said, look, man, I'm flattered. I'd love to, but I'm an entrepreneur, and if I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it myself. And he said, I knew you were going to say that. I go, what? He's like, you should run your own fund. Let me help you, like, think through setting up a structure, and we can, you can make some introductions to some service providers. And, oh, by the way, I've already pitched you to Mark Andreessen and Chris Dixon, and they want to be the first money into your fund. And so I was like, how do you pass that up? So asymmetric, which is my firm, we're a technologically driven investment firm in digital assets.
00:06:21.158 - 00:06:35.440, Speaker B: And so we have a couple of early stage venture capital funds, a hedge fund, and we launched in, technically launched in June of 2022, and we have done pretty well. So that's kind of my story.
00:06:36.260 - 00:07:07.120, Speaker A: Nice. Nice. It seems like you have a crazy background, and I really like to follow you because you have this macro driven theses and also, like, a technological theses. And I think I listened to one of your other podcasts, and you mentioned that from March 2023 to March of this year, you were one of the most, or you're like the top performing fund in the world. So, like, what's that like to just, you know, like, outperform, I guess, the entirety of the world? I guess. Like, what were the few trades that you made that really propelled you there?
00:07:08.060 - 00:07:47.490, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. And just, just so I'm super clear, this is not a solicitation whatsoever, but you're right. Like, this is just data that was actually provided to us. We didn't even know this was true. So there's a company called prequin, which is kind of like a loosely, like a data marketplace. So what they do is tens of thousands of hedge funds and venture capital funds, et cetera, will kind of submit their performance data to prequin. And then on the other side, capital allocators, investors that are looking for fund managers to invest in, can kind of sort by industry or vertical or strategy or performance.
00:07:47.490 - 00:09:01.976, Speaker B: And they reached out to us and said, you know, for, you know, basically the past. This was in April, that the past trailing twelve months you guys are the top performing hedge fund on the planet, across any asset class, so not just crypto. And I was like, what? You know, because we, I wasn't even tracking it. It was like, we're just doing what we do, staying heads down and focused on, on, you know, generating great returns for our limited partners, our investors. And so it was, I mean, it was awesome, right? It was a great feeling to know that in effectively less than two years of existence, while also going through one of the most brutal bear markets in all asset classes of 2022, were the number one fund on the planet. Like that is just, I mean, it's hard to explain the feeling that you get when you find that out, but, you know, we will not be number one forever. Like, I have a target on my back, right? Like, I'm not dumb enough to think that we're going to stay number one forever, but our strategy really hasn't changed, right? Like, we're not like, oh, now that we're number one, we have to kind of like stay in the poll position and you know, over trade or really like do something that is not consistent with our strategy.
00:09:01.976 - 00:10:23.764, Speaker B: And in, you know, call it like trader investor or hedge fund parlance, there's this concept called style drift, where if something isn't working, you try to drift to this new style of like, oh, like I'm a really good commodities trader, but I'm not making any money, so let me go trade exotic options in stocks or something, right? That's a drifting away from your core style. We don't do that and we don't chase. Right? So, for example, when the Ethereum ETF news came out, which kind of shocked everybody, if we were drifting on our style, we would have chased that trade. But we maintain a very fundamental view on the macro picture as well as what the best way of expressing our views are as it relates to macro. And so for us, chasing the Ethereum trade would have been an example of style drift, which we didn't chase. How did we get that level of performance? One, I'm not going to give away too much of the secret sauce, but what I'll share is that between myself and my trading partner, we have almost 50 years combined experience trading and managing risk. My trading partner is, in my opinion, I'm probably biased, but the best options and derivatives trader I have ever met in my life, just absolutely brilliant.
00:10:23.764 - 00:11:18.806, Speaker B: And I have a lot of skill sets on pattern recognition flow, um, but also a deep technical understanding. So one of the benefits to, you know, having a technical background in crypto is that if you're also a trader, you can look at what's happening in the space and see narratives forming, or the, the progress that's happening within like GitHub repositories, reading the source code and saying, oh, wait, this is actually kind of huge, and no one's talking about it, and it's publicly available information. It's just buried in source code on GitHub. Well, I can now come up with like a trade idea. Like, hey, XYZ program or project is going to be launching this thing. It's in their GitHub repo now let's go express the best trade in the, in the hedge fund portfolio. And so that could be options that could be buying the spot token, it could be myriad ways of actually expressing the view.
00:11:18.806 - 00:11:54.216, Speaker B: And so a couple of things that we were very good at last year was really, I guess, since the beginning actually is nailing the macro. And so we have this thing called a market update that we put out every, every month. It's free, anybody can read it. You can go to subscribe asymmetric financial to sign up for it. And if you go all the way back from when we started publishing these in August of 2022, we've been more or less spot on with our macro stuff. So, for example, back in September of 2022, we said the Fed is going to stop hiking rates between five and 6%. They stopped at 5.5.
00:11:54.216 - 00:12:38.160, Speaker B: And our view currently is they're going to start cutting rates. We don't see the path for any rate hikes going further. So we were way ahead of that. In February of 2023, we predicted that there would be stress in the regional bank sectors because the unequal distribution of reserves across all of the banks was not looking good. A month later, SVB collapsed. Our macro view informs our guardrails directionally on how we want to be invested. And then the question is, well, then, how do you make money on that? Well, one, we had a view in late 2022 that Solana getting down into the low teens and then ultimately $8.
00:12:38.160 - 00:13:15.544, Speaker B: This is like a generational buying opportunity. And so we got really long Solana at the bottom, right. But we didn't just buy the spot token, we bought the spot token. But we also put on what's called a risk reversal call spread that cost us no money to put on and made a fortune from it. So we kind of augment like our view with the optimal expression, whether it's buying spot, in this case, running like a risk reversal call spread. And then furthermore, in 2023, we made a lot of money on bitcoin, but not just buying the spot token. Right? We track volatility really closely, and when.
00:13:15.544 - 00:13:39.320, Speaker B: When volume is really low, you want to buy it. When volume is really high, you want to sell it. We bought, you know, a bunch of bitcoin options and bitcoin spot when the SVB thing was kind of just about to collapse. Right. And that worked out because we thought, hey, people, when there's. When there's stress in the financial system, people go to safe haven assets. Well, historically, that's golden.
00:13:39.320 - 00:14:20.030, Speaker B: But now there's a digital representation of gold. Bitcoin should benefit. Now, we could have been dead wrong, but it wasn't wrong. And so that's another performance driver for us. And if we fast forward all the way towards, like, q four of 2023, I had a really firm belief that based on a lot of the on chain data that was coming from, say, like, stablecoin flows out of ethereum into Solana. Um, you know, some. You know, we were kind of saw, like, the fake news headline in October of, uh, I think the coindesk intern, or Cointelegraph, I don't remember who it is, but ironically kicked off the bull market, like, just in true crypto fashion.
00:14:20.030 - 00:15:10.596, Speaker B: And so we were looking at it going like, yes, we could just be long bitcoin here, but what is going to be beta to bitcoin that's actually going to outperform bitcoin? Um, that has probabilistically a better chance than, say, like, ethereum, just as a beta trade, which obviously got crushed against bitcoin last year on the EBTC trade. Turns out that's Solana. With all the on chain forensics and all the stuff coming to it, we were like, you know, it's. It's Solana. Well, within Solana, then what's beta to Solana? And typically, that is a dog coin. Well, there was really only one, you know, meme coin or culture coin or dog coin that that mattered on Solana at that point, and it was bonk. And so at the $28 million market cap, I started to do an analysis of, like, okay, at the market peak, dogecoin was 85 billion, Shiba Inu was 48 and a half billion.
00:15:10.596 - 00:15:36.400, Speaker B: Dogecoin was a fork of, you know, bitcoin or bitcoin ish, like, proof of work. Shiba Inu was basically the Dogecoin killer on Ethereum. It's like, well, it's Solana's turn, and if I'm right, this is a massive asymmetric trade. It's trade a $28 million market cap. If this thing goes up to 2.8 billion, it's 100 x on the return. Now, the difference is, at our firm, because we manage risk in a really diligent way.
00:15:36.400 - 00:16:22.854, Speaker B: We have what's called a concentration risk policy. So any token that isn't in the top 20 by market cap, the maximum amount we can purchase is 2% of the funds asset under management. And so we couldn't buy $5 million with a bunk. Right? We had to buy less than that because our firm's AUM was lower at the time. But that trade was a massive performance driver, because even though we were only to buy a small amount of it, the net result was 50 x or whatever it was on the trade. And so a lot of that is like, this is an example of how we have macro to influence things. We want to catch on with narratives and find the most optimal expression of that, with the kind of call it fixed amount of risk.
00:16:22.854 - 00:16:30.650, Speaker B: And that is the reason, I think, that we were able to effectively outperform everybody for those trailing twelve months.
00:16:31.230 - 00:17:17.638, Speaker A: Yeah, well, thank you for going through, I guess, the past twelve months. And I think a lot of people get into crypto for the asymmetry of these trades. People want to buy $100 or a couple thousand dollars of whatever and have it turn into one hundred k, a million dollars or whatever, I guess those returns might be. And I guess looking for those asymmetric risk reward opportunities is really how you, I guess, drive performance. And I want to pull up this tweet or I guess, this thread where you say, hey, Solana is going to a trillion market cap. And, I mean, we can touch on a bunch of points here, but I think one thing that I want to touch on is, I guess you talked about meme coins on Solana having pride market fit. And I think you talked about this as a reference to, I guess, the casino industry.
00:17:17.638 - 00:17:31.598, Speaker A: Where can you talk about, like, I guess, you know, how does. I guess, like, Las Vegas, or how does meme coins have similarities to, I guess, the Las Vegas business model, the casino business model, and how that drives, I guess, your views on the meme coin super cycle, as they call it.
00:17:31.774 - 00:17:58.980, Speaker B: Yeah, so. And I will. I'll kind of, like, frame it around it, meme coins on Solana specifically. Right. Because the kind of impetus for the thread is, look, Solana's found product market. Fitzhen, by offering meme coins up, you can see the enormous amount of activity on Solana and a lot of it has to do with the fact that it's dead simple. It's fast, it's cheap, there's all these telegram bots, there's exchanges, super simple stuff to do.
00:17:58.980 - 00:18:30.270, Speaker B: The reason I mention the casino or gaming gambling industry is that the gambling industry is literally designed to take your money. Okay? Like, right. If you walk into a casino, the. The games there are skewed in the favor of the house statistically. Now, there is one game. It's the only game that I tend to play, which is craps, which if you don't make, what are these suckers bets. So if you go to a craps table, a lot of people are like, I don't know how to play craps.
00:18:30.270 - 00:19:00.236, Speaker B: It's so intimidating. There's so many different bets. That's by design, because the. The bets on that table, the majority of them are suckers bets where the odds are super favored to the house. However, there's one bet that you can consistently make on a craps table, and if you stick with it, it's the only game in the casino that's slightly in your favor statistically. But most people don't know that, and they don't simply do that right now. Casinos, they started off with their initial use case of people, like, speculating.
00:19:00.236 - 00:19:59.000, Speaker B: I'm speculating that I'm going to make money gambling at this casino. And also, it's fun. You have a cocktail, you're with your friends, you know, et cetera, et cetera. It turns out that as of last year, in 2023, 75% of the revenue that Las Vegas strip casinos made were non gambling revenue. So they made money from the nightclubs and the restaurants and the shopping and the pool parties and all of these other things, the Cirque du Soleil shows, et cetera. And what dawned on me that's so unique about that is that the speculative, the initial use case was speculation that then moved into use cases, like proper use cases. If you want to use like the crypto thing or what is the actual use case? What's the utility? And I started to do some research on this, and it turns out that every industry ever started off a speculation.
00:19:59.000 - 00:20:56.806, Speaker B: Speculation is actually a necessary and sufficient requirement for any industry to exist and then move into other potential use cases. So, for example, in the late 18 hundreds here in the United States, there was this new speculative industry called the railroad industry. And the initial use case, literally was speculation. People speculated that this industry is going to be somehow very valuable. And people were, you know, investing and doing all of the kind of degenerate stuff that you see in crypto, but for railroads. Well, it turns out that the initial use case of speculation led to the kind of industrial revolution and making the United States one of the most powerful economies on the planet today. Right, if certainly the most powerful today, but back then, moving it towards that.
00:20:56.806 - 00:22:03.882, Speaker B: And so when I looked at what was happening on chain with. With Solana, with the meme coins, the reason I was suggesting that it has product market fit is that we have now found a way to represent gambling through attention tokens, right? Like meme coins are, in most cases, you're capturing attention, right? So right now, you have the music artist Iggy Azalea launching a meme coin token, and it has just captured the attention of so many people. And the token itself is the kind of financial contract that you can own and speculate on around this form of attention gathering that is a speculative gambling entertainment style use case. However, in a lot of cases, like bonk, the kind of meme coin, speculative entertainment use case, eventually moves to real use cases. Bonk has, I don't know, half a dozen products right now that are generating real revenue. And it started off as a culture coin or a meme coin for. For Solana.
00:22:03.882 - 00:22:34.554, Speaker B: So, you know, if I zoom out and I look at this and go, Solana is now enabling. The reason I believe Solana has product market fit is that it's the chain for retail. Like retail people can just come on there and kind of gamble, speculate. Like it's entertaining. It's funny. There's all this culture around meme coins. Like, did you get rugged? Is the dev going to do something? The Dev's not saying there's all this culture around that that is very specific to meme coins.
00:22:34.554 - 00:23:19.490, Speaker B: Just like there's a very broad culture around the casino gambling industry. And so I believe that by seeing what Solana's technology is capable of doing and enabling meme coin mania, we are seeing product market fit for that chain. That does not imply that this is the only thing Solana is going to enable going forward. We have loads of Dpin projects like helium and Hivemapper, et cetera. You have interesting takes on content creators and content distribution through drip. There's a lot of other things that are, in fact, happening. But right now, you can very much clearly see that retail loves to trade meme coins on Solana, right.
00:23:19.530 - 00:23:57.388, Speaker A: And, you know, I think a lot of the eat maxi community was taken or was very surprised by the rise of Solana. But I think looking back in hindsight, it was pretty rational how it happened. I think you know what I mean. I specialize in airdrop farming, yield farming, et cetera. And sometime last year, there was the Jito airdrop, which brought a lot of attention to the Solana ecosystem. And a lot of users went to Solana to form other airdrops, Marginfi, drift, Camino, et cetera. And I guess the problem, or I guess the question is, Solana acquired all these users, TVL, can they retain those users? Because the eredol farming was the customer acquisition tool.
00:23:57.388 - 00:24:46.976, Speaker A: And at the same time, the market started pumping, meme coin started pumping, and retail was like, wait, this is a much better experience than Ethereum. So looking back, I mean, this is something I missed because I kind of mid curved like the whole FTX estate supply and whatnot. But looking back, I mean, it was still rational how it happened. And I think this kind of framework, as if we see TVL flow into an ecosystem, then naturally x percent of those flows are going to buy the meme coin, which meme coins are rational to buy. And I guess bonk was one, because there's all these meme coins launching. But you can't really replicate the bonk story, right? Airdropping does apply, devs selling the bottom, right? And then you coming in with your diamond hands, just accumulating all the supply and all the story. All this lore is really hard to replicate in other ecosystems.
00:24:46.976 - 00:24:49.024, Speaker A: And I think that's why someone has staying power.
00:24:49.152 - 00:26:01.896, Speaker B: Well, look, and to your point, I think it's important to acknowledge that crypto Twitter, I say, has the attention span of a fruit fly. It's just constantly onto the next thing and whatever. And while the flows were coming into, to Solana from, say, ethereum, like, stable coin transfers, everyone, particularly not everyone, a lot of people in the Ethereum community were saying, oh, it's just mercenary capital going over there for airdrop farming, like Jito and these other things, and margin, Phi and Camino, et cetera. And it's like, okay, that is a fair, I would say, argument to be made. But then it's like, well, what happened now? Like, activity on the chain. Like it was so rampant in March that they had a reliability issue with, with the, with the chain that they ultimately ended up fixing because there was so much activity. It's like, if those were people were only there for airdrop farming, like, why didn't we see, like, mega outflows back into ethereum? And then also, why do we have mega activity on the chain? Well, now the narrative is, oh, Solana is only a meme coin casino.
00:26:01.896 - 00:27:04.030, Speaker B: And it's like, well, wait till we get to whatever the next thing is, and then the narrative will shift. I think one of the frustrating things, and you know, the Solana community, I've been in it for five years now. It's actually like a really fun, welcoming community. And we look at these arguments against Solana, and it's like every single time that someone has said one thing or another about how it's horrible, it's not decentralized, it's a vc chain, it's FTX, all of these, none of it is actually true. And we just keep marching along, because the Solana core team, the developers in the ecosystem, they care about this project and believe in Anatolys ultimate vision of creating a blockchain at Nasdaq speed and synchronizing global state at the speed of light. That is an unbelievably attractive engineering problem to developers. They dont care about what other peoples perspectives are, whether or not it's airdrop farming, whether or not it's a meme coin casino.
00:27:04.030 - 00:27:47.148, Speaker B: Because at the end of the day, the numbers speak for themselves. The activity on the chain, the amount of Dex activity, is just continues to make all time highs. And in addition to that, even though I don't believe that it makes a lot of sense to look at something like Solana and say, oh, well, the validators can't actually make any money because of the whatever reason, you know, the fees aren't higher enough or whatever. It's like, I don't even think that's a relevant argument, because where the value is, is on the applications on top. But Solana's making a lot of money now. And I think at one point, they flipped the Eth L1 fees. And so even that argument is falling apart.
00:27:47.148 - 00:28:20.580, Speaker B: So, you know, like Jitto, which is a portfolio company of mine, like, these guys are amazing. Like, you can see the amount of money that they're making from, from tips to validators, uh, for their, for, uh, through geno bundles, like, so again, all of these kind of arguments, they're, they're valid within a certain context and time frame. They've all been debunked. And that's just going to consistently be the case, at least from my perspective, because of the amount of effort and, and desire for the engineers in the Solana ecosystem to make this thing work.
00:28:21.320 - 00:28:51.236, Speaker A: Right. And, you know, if the ETH community is going to, I guess, talk down on the Solana community for mercenary capital, just look at Starknet and Zksync, right. Just totally unusable chains, community eight users. It's really sad, I guess. Let me just pull up this tweet here. I'm not sure if ETH BTC or sole eth this ratio even matters. I guess it does kind of matter because crypto is very tribalistic and there's communities form, and these ratios are a way for one community to bash one another.
00:28:51.236 - 00:29:09.518, Speaker A: But why do you think soul gets so much hate? You know, is it just eth? Max, he's coping, right? The church of eat, right? Just holier than thou. Just, I guess. I mean, eat is up a lot, you know, but it seems like the ETH community is still, like so angry. I don't, I don't understand where all this, like, anger is coming from. Maybe they're like just holding, like, back.
00:29:09.574 - 00:30:16.552, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, look, I definitely poke fun at the Ethereum community, but like, I have said repeatedly that I'm actually a fan of Ethereum because Vitalik basically created this new leap in computer science called smart contract programming. Like that is huge. Like, the impacts on innovation and technology are absolutely massive. The difference is, or there's a couple things here, Ethereum has a physics problem as it relates to scaling the l one. Now, the solution is to offload that to a service called an l two. The problem that I have with this is, one, if the value of ether is primarily driven by activity on the chain, which in theory makes it deflationary and number go up, well, you're just now offloading a percentage of the value of the l one to an l two. And the l two is going to do, you'll say it does tons of activity.
00:30:16.552 - 00:31:08.860, Speaker B: Well, only a fraction of that ends up back settling on the chain. So like, whoops, the deflationary narrative is going to require orders and orders of magnitude of activity on the l two. But oops, there's like 50 l two s. So now you have fragmentation across the l two s, which also can become kind of a user experience nightmare. The other thing is, as it relates to these pairs on the trader side, what a lot of traders do, they're called relative value traders or rv traders. They'll look at the relative value of Ethereum versus bitcoin, the EtH BTC pair, and they say, well, if I'm long Ethereum and short bitcoin, I believe that Ethereum will outperform bitcoin on a relative value perspective. And the same thing for Sol eth.
00:31:08.860 - 00:31:37.696, Speaker B: If you look at Sol eth and you go, well, I'm long soul eth, meaning I'm long soul and short eth. I believe Solana will outperform Ethereum on a relative value. The reason that I like these, these pairs and even Sol BTC, I look at Sol BTC as well, is that you end up with folks like Raoul Paul. I was on real vision back in May. He has a massive platform. He has well over a million followers on Twitter. He's been in tradvi since the nineties.
00:31:37.696 - 00:32:30.050, Speaker B: He's been writing the global macro letter for over a decade. He has a huge audience of primarily, call it older tradfi type investors. He sees the relative value of Sol versus ETH. He sees the fundamental value of Solana as like a global state machine operating at the speed of light and understanding the technical challenges that exist with, with Ethereum. But forget all that. Like, he's promoting to his audience that from a relative value perspective, if you look at the sole ETH chart, if you look at Solana, is 18% of the market cap of ETH. Like, if you're just putting on a trade, do you think EtH goes up more than Solana, or do you think Solana goes up more than ETH? And if Solana starts to get all of these users, it's the chain for retail.
00:32:30.050 - 00:33:13.020, Speaker B: It's generating more revenue than Ethereum, it's doing more Dex volume than Ethereum, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. You would look at this as an investor and go, this thing isn't even one fifth the value of Ethereum. So even if it's only going to be 50% of the value of Ethereum, you're looking at like a two and a half, three x return just by owning Solana versus eth. And so, you know, the pairs. The reason I track them a lot is I need to see at what point, from a technical analysis standpoint as well as fundamental value. Is ETh getting undervalued against Sol, or is Sol undervalued against ETH, which can influence the trading decisions that it ultimately make?
00:33:14.000 - 00:33:46.310, Speaker A: Right. And I think Susu said this in, I think in the podcast I did with, but let the whales deal with E BTC and sol eat. If you're a retail trader, just focus on where you're good at, find your specialty, find your niche, and really push your edge. So a lot of my audience are retail trying to make it the cycle right. Five fixed, seven figs, whatever it may be. What kind of tips do you have for, I guess, people joining the markets in the past couple of months to really outperform and I guess, quote unquote, make it this cycle.
00:33:46.350 - 00:33:50.662, Speaker B: Yeah. This is absolutely not financial advice.
00:33:50.806 - 00:33:51.366, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:33:51.438 - 00:34:26.396, Speaker B: Only for entertainment and education purposes. So, look, I've been trading a long time, and the thing that I have learned, and I have, like, a telegram chat room with a bunch of traders in it that have been running for, like, five years now called market mercenaries. And people always ask me in this chat, like, hey, should I buy this here, or should I, like, what should I do? And I'm like, only you can answer that question, because it's your portfolio, it's your risk. I don't know what your income is. I don't know your situation. I don't, you know, whatever. So that's one thing, is that only you can make the decision.
00:34:26.396 - 00:35:31.022, Speaker B: You shouldn't just be blindly copying somebody else. But two, I do have a firm belief that when you're getting into trading, and, you know, this is probably not what a lot of people want to hear, but it's just a fact, in my opinion, you have to start trading, and then you have to blow up your account once. The reason that this is important is you need to actually learn how to control your emotions as a trader. That's the hardest part of trading, because all of us as human beings experience this thing called loss aversion. We hate losing more than we love winning. And when you're losing or you blow up your account, that feeling is real, right? So then you do it once, and then you kind of work your way to building your account back up again, and then you blow it up again, and now you're ready. And the reason that the second time matters the most is that the way that you were thinking about how to manage risk or your trading style, et cetera, et cetera, was wrong.
00:35:31.022 - 00:36:15.810, Speaker B: And so you then have to get really disciplined around risk. So, for example, at my hedge fund, we never go above one x leverage, meaning we don't use leverage. Why? Because it's crypto, and you don't need to. The difference is, is that a lot of folks that get into crypto, you know, say they got in the past couple months, they'll see these stories of this dude bought $1,000 worth of Wif and now it's worth $3 million. Those are sensationalist headlines meant to drive traffic to media outlets. Those things don't happen all the time, right? Or this guy did 100 x leverage on this exchange, and it's now worth $5 million, whatever. Like, if you're using 100 x leverage, all you need is the price to move against you.
00:36:15.810 - 00:37:04.226, Speaker B: 1% and you get liquidated. Like you're not, that is not a way to actually learn how to trade. And so the tips that I tend to give people is, look, I don't, I'm not, I don't want people to blow up and lose money. But I do believe that if you want to be a trader over time, this is an experience that you have to have, because then you'll start actually being disciplined about the way that you manage risk. I would say tactically, folks ask me, friends of mine that are, you know, don't know much about crypto or anything, and, and I always tell them, like, this is not financial advice, but if I were you, I would just buy a basket of tokens and hang on to them until you reach a price target where you want to take profits. Right. So, you know, the thing that I mentioned to people is it's probably worth owning bitcoin because, you know, it's kind of the steady state.
00:37:04.226 - 00:37:41.864, Speaker B: There's the ETF flows, um, it's institutionally approved at this point. Like that's probably going to do well, but you're going to want some beta to that. And so I mentioned, you know, Solana is on a relative value to, to ethereum is, is deeply undervalued in my opinion. You probably want some Solana and you probably want like a small smattering of exposure to really high beta, which is meme coins. But you don't go buy a the meme coin that just got launched on pump fun five minutes ago. You go with the blue chips. And so I look at Bonk as a blue chip now, and they're definitely doing things in a way that no other meme coin is.
00:37:41.864 - 00:38:24.700, Speaker B: And so if you put that, just that basket together, you probably do pretty well, assuming that the market, my macro view is correct. And I think we have another at least twelve months of this bull market, I think you'll do okay. And then finally, like there's an exchange I led the original round in called cube, cube exchange. These guys even make it simpler for you. They have these bundles you could just buy, you click a button and you could get a BTC soul portfolio or a meme coin, almost like an ETF or an index or something. Even on the user experience side, there's ways of just getting access and exposure to these types of things very, very easily by using something like Q.
00:38:25.590 - 00:38:49.582, Speaker A: Got it. You mentioned something that's interesting. You said that you expect, let's say, the next twelve months of the cycle to continue. I have this audience question here. I think you answered most of these questions, but this specific question around your philosophy for taking profits. You have a salon position, bank bitcoin. I'm sure you have other angel investments and whatnot.
00:38:49.582 - 00:39:10.302, Speaker A: How do you think about taking profits? I think this is the hardest thing to do in crypto, because in crypto, you know, you want to buy coins, right? Like, you want to buy the dream. You want to buy something that might go up. But if you sell, you're selling the dream. You know, it hurts. It really hurts. So how do you, you know, emotionally detach from your bags, not have bag holder buys, and be rational about taking profits?
00:39:10.486 - 00:39:37.704, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is. This is such a great question because it goes back to my original. Excuse me, my original point of, you need to blow up twice to feel that loss. Right. To never experience that again. And so the kind of advice I give to people is that you should never put on a trade without knowing where you're exiting in both directions. Okay, so let's take.
00:39:37.704 - 00:40:09.798, Speaker B: Let's assume you buy bitcoin at 70,000. What is your. And what is the amount you're willing to risk? Let's say you buy $1,000 of the bitcoin. Are you willing to risk $1,000? So you lose all of it? Well, then bitcoin would have to go all the way to zero, right? Maybe you only want to lose $100, so it's 10%. So that means if bitcoin trades below 63,000, which is 10% below 70, you just sell it unemotionally. Right? You're just like, this was my plan. You execute against the plan.
00:40:09.798 - 00:40:40.590, Speaker B: Conversely, if you're like, I'm buying it at 70, and I think it's going to 100k, well, then guess where you're selling it. 100k, right? And the reason this is so important is that the markets tend to get. They flip flop between, like, euphoria and, like, utter depression. And when the markets are euphoric, you need to be taking profits in there. And if you don't have a plan ahead of that, you will get caught up in that. Even I get caught up in this kind of stuff. Right.
00:40:40.590 - 00:41:03.726, Speaker B: But if you have a plan in both directions, you have no remorse. You're like, look, I put on this trade. I was wrong. I have a saying that there's nothing wrong with being wrong. Staying wrong is a sin. Right? So if it goes to 63k in this scenario, and you don't take loss take your, take your loss on it, it's going to keep going lower. Like, I almost can guarantee it.
00:41:03.726 - 00:41:56.380, Speaker B: Right? And furthermore, if you, if you don't sell it at 100k, it could go up another 510, 20% or whatever. But I promise you, if you don't take that profit, it's going to go right back down. It's just the way trading actually works. And so this is the simplest way of thinking about taking profits and losses on like spot tokens. When it gets into options, it gets a little bit different. And I don't know how sophisticated the audience is, but I won't go too deep on the option stuff. But options have a unique characteristic where, because there's time value and whether the option is in the money or not, whether it's a call spread, where it's a fixed amount of profit you could make and a fixed amount of loss because of the premium spent, those are almost somewhat determined for you.
00:41:56.380 - 00:42:39.340, Speaker B: But more importantly, you can roll options if you want to add more time to let the trade work. And so this is much more sophisticated than just like where I'm going to take a stop loss and where I'm going to take profits. Because with options, you're picking strike prices. You're like, I think it's going to this price or I'm selling a put because I believe that if it goes down to this price, I would be buying it there anyway. These are the ways with options. It's not as simple as exiting here, stop lossing here. But for the majority of, I think, retail investors that are probably just buying spot tokens on an exchange, stick with having a plan to execute.
00:42:39.340 - 00:43:06.790, Speaker B: If you execute that plan, who cares if it goes higher? You had a plan to make money. If you, if you bought something at 70 and you sell it at 100k, that's, that's a, that's a great trade, right? Like, you should be very happy about that. It's that when people start to see the euphoria and the p and l postings and these crazy stories of people becoming millionaires and whatnot, they get caught up in that. That's emotions. If you have a plan, there's no emotions. It's purely execution.
00:43:07.850 - 00:43:39.166, Speaker A: Right, right. Yeah. Crypto is such a reflexive asset class where people become more bullish on the way up and more bearish on the way down, that you can't just be like, oh, I'm a solo cup because I'm a genius. You really do have to stick to a plan. I made a video on this a couple months ago, I spent like an hour talking about JLP, and a little birdie told me that you're actually a really big holder of JLP. And I really like this asset because it's roughly two thirds risk assets. So sol bitcoin, eth, and a third stablecoins.
00:43:39.166 - 00:44:11.828, Speaker A: And it's a way to provide liquidity on the Jupyter perps platform. And if, I mean, retail tends to be super long, right? So if the market goes down, then those trader losses accrue back to JLP. And even when the market goes up, I mean, it still goes up. I mean, this literally looks like a honey pot scam. But how do you think about, I guess, using on chain tools, like how much for, like, how much of your fund is on chain? Do you do any farming? If so, like, you know, what kind of things do you look into when it comes to things like farming and whatnot?
00:44:11.964 - 00:44:28.354, Speaker B: Yes, all the above. So we do a ton of stuff on chain. And yeah, of course, we got the geeto airdrop, we got the drift air drop, we got the Camino airdrop. Well, if margin fight is a token, we'll get the margin airdrop, right?
00:44:28.402 - 00:44:29.850, Speaker A: Hopefully they do it at some point.
00:44:29.970 - 00:45:19.236, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's a very, very small portion of our strategy. So, for example, with drift, we think it's a great product for trading perps. Um, we just happen to trade a lot of sides on there, which got us the max allocation of the airdrop. So it's actually like a second order effect that we end up, um, getting air drops. Um, I have been trying to keep JLP under wraps for so long, because I feel like, again, absolutely not financial advice, but like, if you. I have read and reread and reread the docs behind this thing, trying to find why this thing wouldn't work, and I can't find it. And so we roll a lot of our profits into JLP, and part of that is on a cycle basis.
00:45:19.236 - 00:46:28.964, Speaker B: We believe that if over the course of the next twelve months, more liquidity comes on chain, more retail users, more people trading perps on Jupiter, Solana, bitcoin and Ethan going up, like all of these things, right? Our view is that if you look at the annualized percentage return on just holding JLP, it's like 125, 130%. I mean, it flip flops a little bit. That's crazy, because all this is liquidity pool token that goes up over time, at a minimum from the trading revenue from like funding rates and liquidations and this sort of thing that just goes back into the value of the token. And again, to your point, it looks like a honey pot scheme, but it's just designed really well. And so when it first came out, and I'm close with the Jupyter team, one of the devs on our team actually found the URL to the perps exchange before they even. This is like one of the benefits of having half the company being software developers and hackers. It's like he's like, check this out.
00:46:28.964 - 00:47:34.582, Speaker B: Before it even launched. And that's when I started to realize, like, wait a second. Like, this thing, this JLP token is like, is this, like, the best way to park profits ever? And, you know, yes, when the market's going up, JLP should go up. I think one thing to recognize, and we have to acknowledge this because, yes, we're a very large holder of JLP, is when there's, like, in April when the market was puking, the liquidity for JLP dries up quickly. And so if you have a massive amount of it and you need to actually get access to that liquidity, you're going to take a hit on the value of your JLP holdings. Right. So we monitor and manage kind of like, how big are we relative to, you know, the total amount of outstanding of JLP? But more importantly, like, the Jupiter team has every desire to increase the trading volumes for their perps, Dexde, which means there's going to be more liquidity added over time, which means if you need to actually get out of a $10 million worth of JLP or something like that, you're going to be able to get out of it much easier in the future.
00:47:34.582 - 00:48:03.088, Speaker B: So, yeah, a lot of the stuff that we do is on chain. We have a lot of sophisticated technology that we've been building in house that's only proprietary to asymmetric. That enables us to do a lot of stuff that's unique on chain. We, you know, one could imagine running fleets of liquidators, keepers, validators, guardians, et cetera. Those are passive income streams for running servers. We know how to run servers. There's a lot of stuff that I think we do at asymmetric.
00:48:03.088 - 00:48:15.300, Speaker B: I mean, obviously, every fund wants to say that they're so differentiated, but I don't really know another fund that's doing this type of stuff with the combination of skill sets that we have from global macro to running liquidators on chain.
00:48:16.290 - 00:48:40.122, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. I mean, I personally love JLP. I guess, unfortunately, I don't really have funds on it. I just hold eth right now, or mostly just forming eardrops and whatnot. But I kind of did this study on, I guess, GMX and GLP, where, because GLP is kind of a fork of GLP. And I was like a big GMX farmer and I kind of studied the price patterns of GLP.
00:48:40.122 - 00:49:02.868, Speaker A: And, you know, I took the price of GLP at these, you know, points. The bitcoin top in November of 2021, when three ac liquidated got liquidated FTX candle. And I guess March 4 was when I was looking at it. But, you know, literally bitcoin topped November 2021. And the price of GLP, which is like the same thing as GLP, was 142.
00:49:03.004 - 00:49:03.460, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:49:03.500 - 00:49:32.708, Speaker A: And when, you know, FTX died, that was like when bitcoin was at 16k, because all the fees were accruing. The price of GLP was at 125, only a 12% drawdown. So, you know, of course, smart contract risk, do your own research on one. But I think that denominating your portfolio later on in the bull market into LP tokens like this, I think is a pretty good profit taking strategy. That's kind of how I think about it, because I don't really have confidence in my abilities. Time to top. I'm a mid curve, right? I just get way too bullish as the markets go up.
00:49:32.708 - 00:49:51.058, Speaker A: So I kind of have these rules for myself. It's like, okay, just have humility. I can't sell the top. So, you know, when things are frothy, maybe just denominate in, you know, these LP tokens. Because if the market goes up, it goes up. If the market goes down, then I will generally outperform. And I think, you know, people should take or people should think of these plans ahead of time.
00:49:51.058 - 00:49:56.618, Speaker A: Because if you're, if you don't think about profit taking, then you're just going to be, you know, bag holding the top, essentially.
00:49:56.754 - 00:50:44.636, Speaker B: Yeah. Which is, again, why I suggest having a plan. And, and I love this analysis of GLP because, you know, look like even the fact that it was only a 12% drawdown, like, look at the other assets in space to get absolutely decimated, right? So, for example, you know, you're an expert in yield farming. Like, assume you farm a bunch of tokens. Let's assume you take profits in them, and then you, like, roll it into something like JLP. Like that seems like a good way to park your profits, right? Because it's still earning value over time. And in the case that there are drawbacks or drawdowns in theory, it won't be as extreme because it's offset to your point by the revenue from trading and liquidations and funding rates.
00:50:44.636 - 00:51:17.250, Speaker B: And so this is another reason why, like when I was digging in and digging into JLP, I was like, where's the catch? Right? I was really looking for it. And I also have to be, you know, cognizant of the fact that as we roll profits, I can't, at the fund level, I cant be rolling significant size profits into something like JLP because of the liquidity constraints. As a retail investor, man, I think it makes a lot of sense when youre taking profits. If you dont want to just sit in cash, you could have some exposure like this, which is somewhat de risked.
00:51:18.470 - 00:51:32.000, Speaker A: What are some books and blogs or best books and blogs that you would recommend to the audience? Learn more about, I guess, psychology, markets, macro if you have any, I guess, tips or I guess, recommendations.
00:51:33.020 - 00:52:34.112, Speaker B: Yeah, I get this question a lot because I think it's, first of all, I think it's valuable for people that are wanting to learn about this. They want to seek knowledge and kind of reading books is a fantastic way of doing that. Unfortunately, my answer is going to disappoint people is that I have literally never read a trading book. I haven't read a technical analysis book, I haven't read an investing book, like none of it. So I have a degree in philosophy with a focus in logic, but I'm a big kind of Nietzsche fan and Schopenhauer and also more, I would say, contemporary philosophers like Nassim Talebden. The advice I give to people is if you want to read some books that are going to, I think, make you a better risk manager, which is ultimately going to make you a better investor and trader, I would read the kind of compendium of books that Taleb wrote. So this is skin in the game.
00:52:34.112 - 00:53:21.664, Speaker B: This is fooled by randomness, this is antifragile. And the reason I suggest this is that fooled by randomness was one of the most eye opening books for me because Taleb is a former, like, amazing options trader. He's kind of a prick on the Internet, but like, besides that, he's very good at identifying tail risks. The black swan is his book, right? And so like fooled by randomness is this book where like when you'll see people say specifically on like, you know, traditional financial media, CNBC, Bloomberg, et cetera, they're like, oh, the stock market went up today because of x. Like, that's nonsense. There's no, the only reason something goes up or down is because there's more buyers than sellers or more sellers than buyers. That's it.
00:53:21.664 - 00:53:47.630, Speaker B: You can't look at, like, one event as a thing. That is why something happened. And in something, like, fooled by randomness, he kind of illuminates all these examples of where people were fooled by something that they thought was, like, very causally LinkedIn, and it turned out to be utterly stochastic. So that's like, that can influence your risk management skills. Right. In addition to that, antifragile. This is where I got the name from my firm, asymmetric.
00:53:47.630 - 00:55:03.234, Speaker B: The concept behind antifragility is that you want to be a part of systems that benefit from shocks to the system. So, for example, your immune system, if you get a flu, like a cold, um, it kind of makes you feel crappy for a bit, but then what your body is doing is it's creating antibodies to fight it off in the future so you don't get sick anymore. So it's kind of like you hit, you got this shock to the system, but now you benefit from it because your immune system is stronger. Right? So that also dovetails into looking for asymmetry in antifragile systems. So, for example, you would want to be favoring trades in the context of this podcast, things that have little to no downside with asymmetric upside. And it sounds like, well, duh, I want, like, asymmetric upside, but identifying the things in life in general, let alone trading where there is little to no downside, and asymmetric upside, takes a lot of practice and time. And the book antifragile, kind of gives you almost like a framework for how to start viewing the world through this lens.
00:55:03.234 - 00:55:10.990, Speaker B: It has been incredibly helpful for me as a early stage venture investor, angel investor, and also trader.
00:55:11.930 - 00:55:38.548, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Taleb has really good books, despite him being a bitcoin hater. I read Black Swan, fooled by randomness. I think it's because people love to rationalize why things have happened. It's like, oh, price went up because this. And it makes them feel better about themselves, because people dislike uncertainty. I think one mistake I think people make in crypto is that, oh, like last time this happened, bitcoin went down 10%. So the max drawdown this time is 10%.
00:55:38.548 - 00:55:46.108, Speaker A: Well, how do you know that 10% is Max? I mean, we had Covid, we had all these exogenous shocks, which could even lead to bigger drawdowns.
00:55:46.244 - 00:55:46.692, Speaker B: That's right.
00:55:46.716 - 00:55:56.150, Speaker A: And I guess there's like the, you know, chart of, like, thanksgiving turkey, where everything is, like, going so great, and then you know, it's Thanksgiving and turkey goes to zero. It goes to zero, right, exactly.
00:55:56.190 - 00:56:28.444, Speaker B: Well, I mean, there's. There's even a more kind of, I would say, morbid example where, well, I mean, turkey dying is definitely morbid. But, you know, here's an example that I use with folks about, like, avoiding the risk of ruin is something that you should always do. The risk of ruin means, like, you don't get to play the game anymore, right? Like, blowing up, taking up too much risk, or I. Or using fancy math to be like, oh, well, like, the odds of this are, like, so in my favor, I'm not going to do it. So I'm going to give you an example of a game where the odds are in your favor, but if you lose, you literally cannot play anymore. And that's russian roulette.
00:56:28.444 - 00:57:05.484, Speaker B: So if you have a pistol with six. Six bullets or six chambers for bullets and one bullet in it, that's a one out of six chance, right? Dude, you got five out of six chances of winning. Those are great odds, except for the one time you're wrong, you're dead, you literally cannot play the game again. And so this is one of those things where, you know, seeking asymmetry, like, asymmetric upside, limited to no downside, should be coupled with avoiding the risk of ruin. Right. When. When we're going through large drawdowns and the market's pulling back and people are getting super depressed and people are getting liquidated, the thing that you have to remind yourself is you have to live to fight another day.
00:57:05.484 - 00:57:17.760, Speaker B: The market will give you infinite opportunities to make money and make money back that you may have lost as long as you're still in the game. So avoiding the risk of ruin is the only way of actually achieving that.
00:57:18.340 - 00:57:31.920, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think this is one of the problems with crypto Twitter. It's like, if you miss a move in a coin, people just make you feel bad. It's like, oh, you're not long. This Ainon right, and it makes you feel fomo. But I think people just have to find what they're good at. Stick to your edge.
00:57:31.920 - 00:57:35.720, Speaker A: What would be. How would you define your edge in the markets?
00:57:39.500 - 00:58:20.070, Speaker B: So my edge is probably that every edge you have gets dull over time. So I think constantly evolving your strategies without drifting too far away from what you're good or bad at, right, is very, very important. So, for example, in early 2023, I had this view. Excuse me, in December of 2022, heading into 2023, we knew that the Chappella upgrade was coming. And they were going to move the proof of stake. And so I had this view of, like, so I think liquid staking. You know, tokens are probably going to be pretty important for, for Ethereum, even from a narrative perspective.
00:58:20.070 - 00:58:40.580, Speaker B: People are just going to want to own this stuff. Well, who's the biggest, you know, stakers? Lido. Well, they have a token, right? And it trades on Coinbase. That means anybody, you know, most anybody can access it in some capacity. And it was trading, like, I don't know, 90, $0.95, something to that effect. And surely enough, within a couple months, it ran to, like, $3 and change, and we sold it.
00:58:40.580 - 00:59:15.990, Speaker B: That edge was gone. Right? Like, that was a trade. Holding on to Lido beyond that didn't make any sense because the trade was based on this view that we had in, like, this short window of time. And it happened to work so constantly kind of understanding what your strengths and weaknesses are as a trader and investor, and just accepting that your edge will eventually go away implies you need to be constantly reinventing your edge. And so that's one of the things that we do at asymmetric.
00:59:17.370 - 00:59:30.720, Speaker A: I guess it takes humility to, I guess always, you know, I mean, it's comfortable for a trader to be able to say, hey, like this. This is my strategy. It's worked for the past six months. I'm going to retire off this. But at some point, you know, if a strategy is actually good, it's going to.
00:59:30.760 - 00:59:32.900, Speaker B: That's the fastest way to not retire office.
00:59:33.240 - 01:00:00.006, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And even with, like, you know, the entire market knows Chappelle is coming. You know, even EIP 4844, I think Lido topped two months before Chappella, and, like, arbitrary optimism, topped two months before EIP 4844. At the end of the day, like, no one really wants to hold these tokens. It's more of, I guess, an instrument to make money off a catalyst. And if there's so many attention, if there's so much eyeballs on a particular catalyst, I mean, chances are it's already somewhat priced in.
01:00:00.158 - 01:00:00.670, Speaker B: That's right.
01:00:00.710 - 01:00:09.130, Speaker A: And I think, you know, being able to recognize that is also very, very important. So, final question, what would be if you could give advice to your younger self? What would it be?
01:00:13.030 - 01:01:06.228, Speaker B: What would it be, man, actually. Uh, so the, the truth of this answer is very, very real. Um, I would actually tell my younger self to hyper optimize for sleep. And the reason I say that is, um, if you don't get really good sleep, you're kind of like, you know, a drunk person trying to make decisions. And so by optimizing your life to have a solid sleep routine sets you up for success. And the science behind this is very clear. If you aren't getting consistently good deep sleep or if you're drinking before you go to sleep, or you're looking at your phone before you go to sleep, it affects your sleep, which will then ultimately affect your performance in the world.
01:01:06.228 - 01:01:34.218, Speaker B: Whether it's at your job, it's in your relationships, sports. Like, pick something. And so I think if I could have convinced myself 20 plus years ago to really start to build a really good practice around sleep, that's probably what I would do. Some people would say, like, I would love to have built, like, a meditation practice or something to that effect, which I also think is valuable. I don't. I don't necessarily do that. What I try to do is optimize for sleep because when I get really good rest, you kind of get the results that you end up with.
01:01:34.218 - 01:01:35.550, Speaker B: Things like at asymmetric.
01:01:36.260 - 01:01:50.372, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess trading is like a sport and you have to, you know, take care of your body because your brain is how you make money, technically. So if you're not, if your brain isn't functioning properly, then, you know, I guess you're also bleeding like money and EV and whatnot.
01:01:50.516 - 01:01:51.108, Speaker B: Right?
01:01:51.244 - 01:01:57.040, Speaker A: But anyways, thank you so much, Joe, for coming on. Do you have any final words to our audience?
