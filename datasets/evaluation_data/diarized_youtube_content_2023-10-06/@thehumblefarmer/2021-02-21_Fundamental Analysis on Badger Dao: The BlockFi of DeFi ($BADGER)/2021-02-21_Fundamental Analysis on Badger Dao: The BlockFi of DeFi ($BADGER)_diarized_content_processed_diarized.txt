00:00:01.200 - 00:00:31.976, Speaker A: What's up, guys? Welcome to the channel. And in this video I'll be going over Badger Dao, the blockfi of Defi. If you liked the video, please like and subscribe and comment in the comment section below. Now, the goal of this channel is threefold. First, I believe that crypto doesn't have to be a casino or a game of trying to catch pumps and dodging pumps, dodging dumps. I think you can invest in fundamentally sound projects that will accrue value over time. Now, invest is a strong word because, you know, so many things happen in crypto.
00:00:31.976 - 00:01:13.710, Speaker A: Like investing in crypto might be like a four month time horizon compared to like a two year time horizon in stocks. But, you know, you still get the point by understanding why a token is valuable and, you know, the projects ethos, I think we can understand when a token is undervalued and when a token is overvalued. And primarily I'll be going over, you know, in my opinion, undervalued tokens, in this case, Badgerdao. None of this is financial advice and full disclosure. I own badgerdao tokens. So what is badgerdao? So badgerdao is basically a yield farming protocol for bitcoin. And its whole ethos is bringing bitcoin to defi.
00:01:13.710 - 00:01:43.818, Speaker A: That's their mission. And this really resonates with me because crypto, when I got into crypto, it was because of bitcoin. And I associate myself, I identify myself as a bitcoiner. And, you know, I really don't like this tribalism between bitcoin and ethereum. Like you have to do, you have to be one or the other. I think there's a space in the world for both to exist. And, you know, with bitcoin, sure, like as a savings technology, it's great, but it's also great to earn yield on it.
00:01:43.818 - 00:02:12.554, Speaker A: And I think there's gonna be, as bitcoin becomes more mainstream and widespread, I think the demand for bitcoin and earning yield on their bitcoin is going to only increase. And I'm really bullish on the prospects of, you know, tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum. As, you know, people might get mad at that, but, you know, I'm bullish on that fact. So let's talk about, you know, Badger and the tokens. So Badger now has three tokens. There's Badger. It's the governance token, which you can currently stake for yield.
00:02:12.554 - 00:02:47.624, Speaker A: I'm currently doing that as well. There's dig, which I'm not going to go over too much in this video, but it's think of it as an algorithmic bitcoin, the supply of rebases every day to try to peg to the price of bitcoin. And it's doing a pretty good job so far. It has around a $400 million market cap. Not going to go over into detail in this video, but if you want me to go over it, please let me know in the comments. And there's another token that's supposed to come out. It hasn't yet, called claw, and it's supposedly going to be a stable coin pegged to the us dollar.
00:02:47.624 - 00:03:29.316, Speaker A: You can mint using assets on Badgr as collateral. I'll go over more on the importance of this, but if you go to app badger finance, you can see this. And these options are sets. They're similar to YFI vaults. You basically deposit your assets into each set and you can earn a really hefty apye. So if you look at this, for example, it looks really complicated, right? Curve five rent, BTC, WBTC, SBTC, but it's basically bitcoin. And with Badger, you can currently earn 30% APY on your bitcoin, which is really, really nice.
00:03:29.316 - 00:04:02.438, Speaker A: Obviously there's risk with anything on Ethereum. There's a smart contract risk, there's the team risk, etcetera. I personally think the team is great and the code has been audited, but, you know, so far so good. And obviously, as the demand for these services increase, the API will also decrease. But comparing it to blockfi 6% on your bitcoin, I think it's pretty, pretty good. And when I think about how to value a token, I like to compare a token to its peers. So Badger Dao is a yield farming protocol.
00:04:02.438 - 00:04:29.902, Speaker A: And what's the number one, the largest yield winning protocol in ETh? It's yearn finance. So Badger has over $2 billion of total value locked as of the 20 February. And this is a valuation. It's fully diluted. Valuation is 1.5 billion. And if you compare that to yearn, you're getting more out of your money, right? If you're trying to invest in a protocol, yearn only has $600 million, but it has a higher fully diluted valuation.
00:04:29.902 - 00:05:29.062, Speaker A: How does that make sense? Obviously, you can't just use this to invest in a token. There's so many other factors that give a token value, but it kind of gives a good framework to understand if a token is cheap or not. And I just included AAVE in there because I think Badger and Aave are really similar in the fact that with both protocols, you basically deposit an asset and earn yield on it. And AavE is the largest lending protocol at $6 billion total value locked with a $7 billion valuation. So this kind of gives a good framework to say to, you know, kind of speculate that, okay, maybe Badger, maybe people are overlooking Badgr as a potential play. And the title of this video was Badger Dao the blockfi of DeFi. Now, why do I believe this? So if you don't know, blockfi is a centralized platform where you can deposit bitcoin and other coins to earn yield on your coins.
00:05:29.062 - 00:06:11.416, Speaker A: I use blockfi. It's a great platform and I think it's only going to grow. Now, if you think about comparing both Blockfi and badger, you know, blockfi, the majority of assets under management for blockfi is in bitcoin. Obviously, you know, people that pause bitcoin earn 6% yield. And, you know, if you want to speculate or if you want to take a mortgage on your house or whatever, you can use your bitcoin to ask collateral to borrow USD. So if you have $100,000 of bitcoin, you can take out a loan for fifty k. And this is really, and this is really nice because traditional banks like JPMorgan, et cetera, they don't consider crypto as an asset.
00:06:11.416 - 00:06:43.158, Speaker A: So even if you have a million dollars, even if you're a crypto millionaire, the bank isn't going to recognize that as a part of, I guess, your net worth of, in a way. So I think the demand for blockfi is only going to increase, especially as bitcoin goes mainstream. And similarly, Badgerdao, you can deposit bitcoin or in a higher yield. There's more risks and there's less demand. So the yield is much higher. And you can also use your assets as collateral to borrow claw. And this isn't verified yet, but I'm in the discord.
00:06:43.158 - 00:07:29.320, Speaker A: I've done a lot of research and it kind of leads me to believe that this is going to be the case. And, you know, as bitcoin is in a bull market, the valuation of blockfi is also increasing. So this is February 12 of 2021. They just raised a series D at almost a $3 billion valuation. And BlockFi has, in terms of assets under management, it's at $4 billion. So you can kind of see that blockFi, like their valuation is going to increase as the total value locked or the assets under management also increases. So if you add blockfi to this chart here, go to this table, you can see that.
00:07:29.320 - 00:08:02.102, Speaker A: Okay. Like, blockfi has $4 billion value locked valuation, almost 3 billion. The tvl to fdv ratio is 1.4. So maybe Badger, you can take blockfi's valuation and kind of simply kind of extrapolate, you know, badger's valuation from just taking the ratios. And they do really, really similar things. And if you think about it, it's not like Blockfi is gonna stay at, what is it, $3 billion valuation. They're gonna.
00:08:02.102 - 00:08:20.570, Speaker A: They're growing rapidly. And in August of 2020, Blockfi's valuation was $4 million. Right. And now it's almost 3 billion. And obviously, since August, the price of bitcoin has five x'ed, more than five x. So obviously the assets under management will also balloon. But, you know, it's.
00:08:20.570 - 00:08:51.720, Speaker A: The valuation of blockbuster is kind of reflexive in that manner because as bitcoin becomes mainstream, people will adopt bitcoin more. And as people adopt bitcoin more, people want a yield, want to earn a yield on their bitcoin. So centralized. It's centralized, and people have issues with that. But Blockbuy is backed by many good investors. And I think it's a. It's a good place, and I think it's cool that you can kind of extrapolate badger's valuation from Blockfi's valuation.
00:08:51.720 - 00:09:23.902, Speaker A: So as Blockfi has shown, you know, these protocols, these companies become more valuable as there's more money in them. Right. Obvious. And badger is in yield farming protocol on Ethereum that focuses on bringing bitcoin to defi. And, you know, like I said, as bitcoin becomes more mainstream, I think the demand for yield goes up. And as that goes up on Ethereum, I think the price of azure will only increase. Now, I want to go over claw again because this is pure speculation.
00:09:23.902 - 00:09:42.780, Speaker A: But I think it's fair to assume that claw is going to have a lot more utility and the demand for claw is going to be much higher. On blockfi, you can use bitcoin to borrow dirty fiat. Right. And what do you want to do with that dirty fiat? I don't know. You can, like, buy a house or whatever, but, you know, there's not much you can do with dirty fiat. Like, thank you for the USD. Like, I mean, I guess.
00:09:42.780 - 00:10:06.244, Speaker A: I guess I can, in a way, buy more bitcoin, but with claw. Claw is a stable coin tied to the US dollar on Ethereum. And there's so much more you can do on Ethereum with stable coins. You can swap it on uniswap. You can one day stake it. Or you can lend it out on Aave and earn a yield. There's so much more you can do with claw than you can do with USD.
00:10:06.244 - 00:10:35.638, Speaker A: And, you know, I think there's also dig, which I didn't go over. And I think that I'm bullish on that too. And all these tokens, there's a dig this claw. And as the utility of these tokens grow, I think the price of the governance token should increase. You know, badgr in itself doesn't do anything. It's just a governance token. You can vote on improvement protocols, but as claw and us, you know, the demand for badger, their protocol increases.
00:10:35.638 - 00:11:02.126, Speaker A: I do think that, you know, Badger will accrue value. Because with Badger, maybe people can vote that. Okay, like, maybe if people can borrow claw at a 10% rate, using their asset as collateral, maybe 1% of it goes to the badger token holders. You know, things like that. I think there's so much claw can do. There's so much badger can do. And I think it's really, really undervalued at where it is today.
00:11:02.126 - 00:11:17.996, Speaker A: Right now it's around $60. And, you know, I'm bullish on Blockfi as a company. Like, if Blockfi ever ipos and I'll be buying that stock. And if I. You're bullish blockfi. I think it's. If you're bullish blockfi as a company, I don't think.
00:11:17.996 - 00:11:45.554, Speaker A: I don't really see a world where you're not bullish badger as a protocol. And, you know, if you just look at the total value locked, right, like, it has $2.3 billion in management at a $1.5 billion fully daily valuation, I think Badger Dao is a really undervalued project and has a lot of potential to accrue value to its investors and token holders. And the thing about Badger is you can. You can stake it and earn around a 20% yield, which is really, really nice. You can't do that with, you know, blockfi.
00:11:45.554 - 00:12:07.578, Speaker A: Like, you can just, you know, you just let your bitcoin sit. So, you know, that's the end of the video. Thank you for watching through the end of it. If you like this video, please like and subscribe and comment. You know, if you want me to go over, dig in more detail, please let me know. And, you know, if there are other tokens that you want me to look into that you think are undervalued, let me know, because I'm all. I'm always looking for.
00:12:07.578 - 00:12:14.390, Speaker A: You know, value plays and good investments. Investments. Right. Anyways, thanks for watching and have a great day.
