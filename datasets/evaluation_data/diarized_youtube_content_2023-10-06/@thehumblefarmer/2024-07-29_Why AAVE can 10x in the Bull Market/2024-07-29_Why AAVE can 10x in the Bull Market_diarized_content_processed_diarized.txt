00:00:00.840 - 00:00:19.590, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Tykee here. And today I want to present the poll case for Aave. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord link will be in the description below. So it's been a while since I've made this type of presentation video, but I just hit 100,000 subscribers. Thank you everyone. We got this plaque. So let's go full circle.
00:00:19.590 - 00:00:56.516, Speaker A: Let's actually talk about Defi because it's been a while, right? It's definitely been a while since Defi has been in the limelight. I argue it's not even in the limelight right now for a good reason. And let's actually address probably the concerns that you're thinking of. It's like, tyky, why are you doing this? It's like, you can buy meme coins, you can buy whatever, just not defi. Like, why Defi? Defi coins? No one likes them. So I'll address a few counter arguments for Defi and then I'll talk about why I think Aave is poised for performance. So, first of all, I mean, this isn't even about Defi.
00:00:56.516 - 00:01:32.112, Speaker A: I think it's more about the general vibes in the crypto ecosystem. I've been full time crypto for four years. I'm terminally online. I think I have a good grasp of how people feel and think. And right now, if you look back on the past, let's say six to twelve months, bitcoin has done well, has an okay, so on, has done really well, meme coins really well, and then everything else, like, the most alts have just like, not done anything. And as a result, I don't think there's much discussions on fundamentals anymore. On social media, it's more about price, right? It's like, oh, this meme coin launch, is it going up? Is it going down? Hahaha.
00:01:32.112 - 00:01:52.112, Speaker A: You made money, I lost money. Hahaha. Great. That's kind of the point, right? It's like people just talk about price, and as a result, a lot of people, including myself, were. I'm kind of jaded, you know, it's like, I believe in the tech, I believe in crypto, but, you know, sometimes I wake up and everyone's talking about meme coins. I don't really care. Okay? Like, I own some meme coins.
00:01:52.112 - 00:02:26.796, Speaker A: I have nothing against meme coins, but I honestly don't care. Right. And I think for the vibes to shift to, you know, make people more optimistic in the future of the space, I think people need to believe in something, okay? And, you know, I'm gonna choose to believe in Defi. Okay, you can choose to believe in whatever, but, you know, this is kind of cringe. But hey, I think we all need to believe in something, okay. I don't think people really believe in meme coins. If people are people that believe in meme coins are people that hold meme coins that want to sell it to someone at a higher price, essentially.
00:02:26.796 - 00:03:14.724, Speaker A: Right? And I guess technically, if I'm long aave, eventually I want to dump on people at some point. Ideally I get to dump on like trash five vc's or whatever that like buy my bag, like five x higher. But the point is, I think we all want to believe in something. I'm going to choose to believe in something, and this time around, I'm going to believe in Defi. I think one of the sectors that's most likely going to benefit the most out of from regulatory clarity, whether it be Gary Gensler stepping down a new president, I have no idea. This is not like a political video, but I think 2025 and beyond, we're going to have different stances on how us treats crypto. And I think Solana, that ecosystem and DeFi will benefit the most because of the ETF and DeFi because it's one of the few sectors that actually makes money.
00:03:14.724 - 00:03:57.740, Speaker A: Okay? All these tokens, the meme, is that they're worthless governance tokens. And that's been true. But, you know, once there's regulatory clarity, like maybe there could actually be value. And Jake Stravinsky, who's one of the crypto lawyers or one of the biggest accounts when it comes to, I guess, like, you know, how like, regulation, legal issues, et cetera, argues that, you know, maybe teams are delaying their products tokens updates until 2025. So this summer may be quieter than usual, and I generally agree with the stance, but we're already seeing particular projects introduce Valley cruel. And I think that's very interesting. But, you know, before I go over that, another counter argument is that the Defi to eat ratio is down only.
00:03:57.740 - 00:04:19.902, Speaker A: And this, this is obviously true. So, you know, one thing I'll talk about is maker. So I've talked about Maker in depth. Last year, I stopped talking about it because people said they're tired of me talking about Maker. But the truth is, Maker has been one of those assets that's been kind of a joke. It's like Dejan Spartan says, maker eat is down, only it's going to zero. But this is the maker e chart.
00:04:19.902 - 00:05:02.624, Speaker A: It looks like it's bottoming. And if you zoom in on where it actually put in the bottom, I think the reason for the bottom is pretty interesting. And I think it also adds to why I think Aave is at an interesting level, to say the least. And then the question is, why did make read bottom? Of course, we can see newer lows like a year from now, but I have good reasons to believe that was the macro bottom. And the only way for it to break that low is if maker dies. If Maker is dead in five years yet, then obviously it's going to go down. But the reason for the bottom was this proposal called the introduction of the smart burn engine in June.
00:05:02.624 - 00:05:25.408, Speaker A: I believe this is June 23 of 2023. It was mid to late June. And essentially, I'm not going to bore you with the details, but, you know, Tldr maker said, hey, we make a lot of money. Let's start buying back our own token. That's basically the proposal. And I talked about this so, like, so much last year, literally a year ago, I saw this proposal, I bought like roughly $1,000. And it was pretty obvious to me.
00:05:25.408 - 00:06:05.226, Speaker A: It's like, okay, like they're buying back their token every single day. Like, it has to go up, right? And, you know, like I said, you know, it's true that most Defi tokens have historically been worthless, but that doesn't mean that it's always going to be worthless. Okay, just because something that's, it's just because something's been worthless for four years doesn't mean that it's going to be worthless in the next four years. Of course, timing, that is pretty difficult. But, you know, makery demonstrated that once value cool is established, the endless fleet, the defi to eth ratio just going down in perpetuity can actually reverse. And since the date of the proposal. So if you just literally bought maker when you saw the proposal, you would have outperformed Eid by 130%.
00:06:05.226 - 00:06:18.550, Speaker A: Pretty easy, right? Oh, like maker is buying back the token. It's posted on the forums by maker. You make two times your read. Pretty simple. Yeah, you would have. Perfect. So back to Aave.
00:06:18.550 - 00:06:42.494, Speaker A: What does this have anything to do with Aave? This is the Aave E chart. It's pretty disgusting looking. Like. What is this? Right? This looks like a scam, right? This looks like litecoin. But. And also, you know, claiming to call a bottom on any asset, I typically don't try to do. I think it's a very difficult game to play because when you're calling a bottom right? After every.
00:06:42.494 - 00:07:07.310, Speaker A: After, like, for a chart that's, like, going down only. And for me to call a bottom, that's essentially the same as me saying, hey, like, I think the market is wrong. I'm right. I'm so smart, right? This is the bottom. And typically, I'm not really that smart, honestly. You know, like, you know, a lot of people know me, right? I'm like the mid curve king, as people call me, you know? And there's a saying. Bottom pickers tend to get stinky fingers, right? You pick your bottom and you get stinky fingers.
00:07:07.310 - 00:07:44.476, Speaker A: Typically, you shouldn't try to pick bottoms. But then I asked myself, you know, what would this, like, when would this thing stop bleeding, right? Because at some point, I mean, Aave, it has to bottom at some point, right? And, you know, this is, like, essentially, like, the main reason why I think it has bottomed. And this is the Ave Domics update that was posted July 25. So I literally bought Aave the same day of this proposal and TLDR, right? They're going to implement a fee switch value cruel. And they're going to call it, like, avionomics update, right? Similar to, like, the japanese avionomics. I'm not going to read. I mean.
00:07:44.476 - 00:07:54.414, Speaker A: I mean, this was very long. I'm not going to bore you with it. But tldr, they're like, okay, we make money. Let's buy back our tokenization. Cool. That's basically it. We're profitable.
00:07:54.414 - 00:08:20.566, Speaker A: We've been profitable. Let's introduce a mechanic where excess profits will go into buybacks. And if you stake your aave, you will get more aave from the buybacks. There's a 20 day unbond period for Aave, but I'll get into that later. So, realistically, the yield isn't going to be high, right? It's like, you can't really expect to stake Aave to get paid, like, 500% APY. That's not going to happen. Realistically, maybe the equilibrium is maybe 8%, 10%.
00:08:20.566 - 00:09:07.506, Speaker A: I mean, I have no idea, right? But something in the, you know, high single digit range is, I think it's gonna be, like, what? The yield is gonna be similar to, like, a dividend stock. And I don't really think people are gonna be buying Aave for the yield, right? Like, I don't really think there's that many people in the world that's gonna be like, wow. Like, the aave staking yield from buybacks is 7%. Time to pump my net worth in the Avi. I don't really expect it to happen. But the question is, or the original question was, when will the Aave to eat ratio stop bleeding? Okay. And, you know, there's a pre opinomics regime and a post opionomics regime, right? Post pre July 25 and post July 25 when, you know, the world knew about this proposal.
00:09:07.506 - 00:09:38.280, Speaker A: And the question is, are there going to be more net buyers after the proposal than before the proposal? Probably. So if there's any place for Aave eat to bottom, if there's any time for this ratio at the bottom, it has to be now. If it doesn't bottom now, then this token probably just goes to zero, honestly. But I'm. No, I'm going to put myself in the arena, right? I'm in the arena trying things and I'm going to try to time this bottom, you know, the OBV eight below 0.03 or 0.003, like, whatever the ratio is.
00:09:38.280 - 00:10:10.028, Speaker A: And sometimes, you know, I can talk about value, cool and whatnot, but some, you know, like, you can use common sense sometimes. It's been ranging at these levels for a few years, like roughly, you know, $100 ish and Aave as one of the most battle tested protocols in Defi with proven product market fit that make money where brand and ladiness is important. Trading at 1.5 billion. You know, sometimes it's that simple. Like 1.5 billion for Aave, you know, in five years from now.
00:10:10.028 - 00:10:41.800, Speaker A: Five years from now, I want people to like, look back this video and be like, how is ave trading at like a billion dollar market cap for like, two years? I mean, it makes no sense to me. I think these are the types of plays or investments where it's okay, like, I'm not claiming to time the bottom, right? Because I have no idea. Okay, I think this is a reasonable time for it to bottom. But I'm more than happy to buy one of the Defi blue chips that's going to benefit from the growth of Defi. That makes money at 1.5 billion. I'm more than happy to take that bet.
00:10:41.800 - 00:11:17.400, Speaker A: And that's more of the point of video. It's not really me claiming the bottom, it's more. So, okay, I think this is a good time to accumulate some aave. Me personally, not financial advice. So this proposal with these five x, they're not going to go live immediately. So this is where the comparison between maker and Aave is not perfect, because for maker, they, you know, they posted a proposal on June and then they start buying back tokens in July. So it was pretty simple, right? Like, sorry, just by maker, make money, right? We all made money for Aave, it's different because there are certain trigger milestones.
00:11:17.400 - 00:11:49.588, Speaker A: So I'll go over that. So first is the go supply. So their stable coin, their decent plus a bit has to hit 175,000,002nd the secondary liquidity. So basically, if you have $10 million worth of or 10 million units of go, you need to be able to sell everything in one clip with a 1% price impact. So go needs to be really quick. A second is, whoops. Second is, you know, I mean, this is like, you know, a long witted way of saying their economics and their budget has to improve and has to be, you know, clear.
00:11:49.588 - 00:12:23.942, Speaker A: Pretty clear. So go market after hit 125 market can absorb a big sell, sustained period of profitability, and then the buybacks are going to happen. I have no idea when, you know, these criteria is going to be met. It could be next month, it could be in six months. But I am expecting these things to go live by end of year. So it may be sometime in mid to late Q four. So one of the risk is that, you know, one of the risks of buying Aave is that, like, this takes longer, and then I'm just stuck holding like very, you know, like aave bags.
00:12:23.942 - 00:12:55.976, Speaker A: It's not doing anything right. Like that's, that would be horrible. But if you look at the growth of go, it's been around for a year, so it took like a year to hit 100 million on market. So obviously, you know, if you're saying, okay, maybe a bear is like, oh, like it took a year to hit 100 million dollar market, it's gonna take another year to get to 200. I mean, that's not really how things work, right. If you're bootstrapping a new stable coin from scratch, you know, the first million is probably harder to bootstrap than the first 5 million. The first 10 million is probably harder than the first 30 million.
00:12:55.976 - 00:13:23.690, Speaker A: So once a stablecoin has momentum, I think it's not going to be that hard to grow. So go is available on Mainnet, and it's also starting to go live on Arbitrum. Liquidity is really not great on arbitrum, so it's mostly on Mainnet. But, you know, they are planning to expand go to other l two s and other ecosystems. These metrics are not that reliable. But you can kind of look at obvious revenue. So these are not profits, it's revenues.
00:13:23.690 - 00:14:17.164, Speaker A: If you analyze the recent numbers, you can get anywhere from, let's say $60 to $100 million in revenues. And cost wise, right now I think they're spending roughly $15 to $20 million in costs. So even on like a price to revenue or price to earnings, you know, I don't really think you can use traditional tradfi metrics to value these things. But, you know, it's not that expensive, it's not that cheap. But the point is, I'm not really buying Aave because it's making x dollars right now. I'm more making a bet that, hey, like, I think Aave is going to grow with DeFi, right? If Defy TVL goes up ten x, I would expect Aave TVL to go up roughly ten x. And if that's the type of bet I'm making, then, you know, their, their numbers, their revenues, profits, it's also going to grow linearly or exponentially depending on how their platform and the go stable point does.
00:14:17.164 - 00:14:41.734, Speaker A: Their treasury is at $60 million. It's okay, right? It's okay. But basically the point is they make money. And I'm sure that. I'm sure some of these, some of this money is going to go into buybacks. And, you know, in terms of improving economics, you know, they are constantly working to cut costs. And I track Mark Zeller, who is basically like the head governance guy for Aave, really closely.
00:14:41.734 - 00:14:58.494, Speaker A: I also talk to him sometimes. I will admit he's kind of crazy. Okay. Even I. Even if you ask him, I think he'll tell you that he's crazy. And also, you know, like, he is full time doing governance for a defi project, right? Like, you have to be crazy to do that type of thing. I definitely don't want to do that.
00:14:58.494 - 00:15:21.480, Speaker A: Right. So he's definitely crazy, but in like a good way, right? It's like, not in like a bad way for you. He's like crazy in a good way in the sense that I think he has like a chip on his shoulder, right? Like, he's been doing this for years. Everyone's telling him that his token is worthless. He's angry. He's like, you know what? Like, I'll prove you wrong. And that's kind of like the energy that he has, at least, you know, the interactions that I've had with him.
00:15:21.480 - 00:15:48.682, Speaker A: But also, how does ave make money? I mean, I view Aave as a bank. It's not as capital efficient, as, like a trash my bank, because, you know, traditional banks, they can rehypothecate. Rehypothecate your funds and, you know, like, just lend it out everywhere. But, you know, Aave is over collateralized, basically. You know, for USDC, let's say the lending rate is 4.8, borrow rate 6.2. They make the delta, right? Like Aave makes 1.45%
00:15:48.682 - 00:16:18.064, Speaker A: of $1.5 billion. So it's not, it's not that much. But I think their main growth driver is going to be go. Because like I said, for USDC, right, they don't own USDC, so they can only clip the delta. But for their own stablecoin go, if they charge, let's say, a 6% borrow rate, they get to keep that entire 6%. So if go continues to grow, then Avi's profits will also grow at a much faster pace.
00:16:18.064 - 00:16:51.698, Speaker A: Of course, they do have to pay liquidity providers and also borrowers and stakers to compensate them for taking on that risk because go is still relatively new. But go has grown from zero to 100 million in a year. And I think, you know, or following Mark Zeller, I think also he's been saying stuff like he expects go to hit a billion by end of year. And then I'm like, you're actually crazy. Who knows? Like, maybe he has some tricks up his sleeve. In his past week, he did mention that, you know, the peg is improving. You know, we're growing.
00:16:51.698 - 00:17:13.570, Speaker A: And at 125 million go, it's going to be net profitable for the protocol, right? Because they're trying to bootstrap this thing. They're paying people to lend LP and whatnot. But at 125, it's going to be profitable. And of course, the benchmark or the trigger milestone is 175. Once that hits and it's liquid, we can go to step three. Step three. I think step three has a sustained period of profitability.
00:17:13.570 - 00:17:46.530, Speaker A: I think they're already at a good rate. So I think the biggest hurdle is gonna. And I think, like I said, end of year, probably going to be decent timing. So next topic I want to go over is competitive modes. And I think this is also one of the reasons why Defi tokens have historically been pretty worthless. And that's because when it comes to, I guess, crypto web3 blockchains, the switching costs pretty low. Pretty low, right.
00:17:46.530 - 00:18:00.482, Speaker A: If you think about tradfi, right. For example, I use JpMorgan Chase. I have a bunch of money there. If I say, hey, I want to move to a different bank, it's going to. I mean, I don't even know where I would start. It'll probably take me a bunch of time. I probably have to call some people, it sucks.
00:18:00.482 - 00:18:22.850, Speaker A: That's why the switching costs for additional bank is pretty high. So they're able to maintain their TVL, let's say, for crypto. Let's say I have a million dollars in Aave. It takes me three minutes to go from Aave to somewhere else. There's not that much loyalty when it comes to crypto. Oh, like that application is giving me tokens or points. Let me go there, I don't care.
00:18:22.850 - 00:19:02.938, Speaker A: So I think that's also one of the reasons why these tokens don't have a premium is because investors really don't have that much visibility a year, 2345 years from now. So how can you invest in something where maybe in a couple of years there's going to be a new competitor or a player that emerges from the ashes worst emote. So. And also, yeah, like, I want to own assets that benefit from the growth of defi. It's hard to, you know, bet on that. And Defy TVL is still pretty, pretty low. I do expect this to hit all time highs, you know, let's say by 2025, early 2025.
00:19:02.938 - 00:20:10.416, Speaker A: But, you know, it's been rather low cluster. And I think when it comes to Defi and on chain, the biggest moat is brand. You know, like, brand value is very important because if you're putting money into a bank, you need to be able to trust that bank. And unfortunately, or fortunately in crypto, or at least, you know, for traffic banks, you know, let's say, you know, Silicon Valley bank fiasco, right? You know, they, I guess depositor loses money, the government steps in, right? There's, there's FDIC insurance, and government will step in to put a backstop into things that doesn't happen in crypto, right? Like, if there's bad debt in aave or whatever money market, the government is not going to save you, okay? Like, you, you just have to eat it. So I think as people, I guess, become more risk averse over time because they get hurt from past events in crypto, right, where people just get rugged or something. I think, you know, brand is important, you know, liquidity is also important. And lending us, I think it's going to be pretty hard to overtake Aave as the crypto bank, given that aave has been around for so long.
00:20:10.416 - 00:20:50.362, Speaker A: So for a new player to emerge, it's going to take time for them to build that trust. That's not to say that other money markets can't thrive, but if I'm investing in something, there's no other thing when it comes to lending markets other than Aave or maker, because it's been battle tested, you know, and I have a saying. So this. I'm not sure if this. If this is a popular saying, but I often say that, you know, friends do not let their friends risk a lot of capital in Aave forks and new lending markets. Okay, like, why would you risk capital in Aave forks or lending markets? It doesn't matter if they have points or high apy. It's not worth it.
00:20:50.362 - 00:21:13.630, Speaker A: In fact, over two years ago, I made this video, and basically I said that Aave is cool. Everything else is going to zero. It's basically the TLDr of this video. Like, all these new money markets, they can do introduce points and stuff, but their token is going to be worth zero. No one really cares. They're going to farm it, they're going to dump, and they're going to move on to the next Aave fork and Aave. So this is their TVl in USD.
00:21:13.630 - 00:21:56.126, Speaker A: It's going up, it's good. It's not all time highs, but also the price for crypto assets in 2021 was crazy. So I think a better indicator is, I guess, tracking the amount of eth in Aave. It's also not at all time highs, but I think it's getting there. Aave is pretty quick to list new LRT's with points programs. I think with either Phi, I think Aave makes, like, roughly ten to $20 million annualized, like, profits per year through, like, the wrapped ether five eat right, because people are, you know, dj leveraging four points, and Aave makes money because, you know, people pay a high borrower rate relative to the lending rate. Also, this is the revenues for AAve.
00:21:56.126 - 00:22:53.292, Speaker A: Sorry, Aave revenues, by token, in the past, let's say, a year or so. And, you know, like, it's making money, right? It's making more money. And it makes sense because as people, or as crypto prices go up, their revenues are denominated in things like ETH and bitcoin. So if bitcoin doubles, then, you know, revenue doubles in USD terms. And also if crypto is entering a bull market or we're in the midst of a bull market, people are willing to pay a higher borrow rate to lever along or farm, right? It's like, if I think EtH is gonna go up, or if people think EtH is gonna go up, people are gonna be willing to pay, let's say, 10%, right, to borrow USDC to belong ETH. Or if people think that they can, you know, like stake USDC somewhere to earn an airdrop, annualize that 20%. If you're gonna be willing to borrow USDC at, let's say 10% against their collateral, either bitcoin, like whatever, to farm these things.
00:22:53.292 - 00:23:33.096, Speaker A: So as there are, or as money enters the ecosystem, as there's more speculative premium in the crypto community or crypto markets, it also drives revenues higher. It's not really sexy. It's not the most sexy play, but I think it directly benefits from on chain coming back as tide as there's more demand for leverage, essentially. And I think what people aren't considering is go. If go really grows exponentially from here, I think that's also going to be a pretty strong growth driver. Maybe not growth driver, but like a revenue driver for the protocol at least. So, I mean, we're 44 slides in.
00:23:33.096 - 00:24:06.102, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure that if you have a pretty low attention span, you probably would have clicked out. And the only people watching by now are like the nerds, right? It's like the geeks and nerds. So for the nerds and geeks, I will just talk about other features of Avi V, four, other updates. Honestly, it's kind of boring, so I'm going to try to keep it brief. It's like Aviv four unify liquidity layer. What does this actually mean? So one example is they're going to have these, or they're going to have like variable rates. So if you're borrowing against ETH, right, like naked Eth, you know, you get like whatever rate.
00:24:06.102 - 00:24:34.898, Speaker A: But if you're borrowing against less liquid assets, you're going to have to pay a premium, right, to account for the risk. And, you know, there was also the incident. I think this is one of the most fatal mistakes in Aave governance. And that was pretty shave when this, when this was happening. And it was when the curve founder, right? Michael Igarov, he took like $300 million with a CRV, which he couldn't sell. And he just borrowed against his assets on Aave. And he indirectly, I guess, like sold, like sold his assets, right, by borrowing against it.
00:24:34.898 - 00:25:09.950, Speaker A: And then he bought mansions. But, you know, Ave's like, okay, like we, we lost money, right? There was bad debt. It was really, really bad. But now I think Aave governance has gotten a lot better. I've been tracking it for years, and they're also going to incorporate isolated markets. So if Miko Igarov can borrow against his illiquid coins, whatever, but it's not going to affect other aspects of the protocol. This concept of isolated markets has been around many years, but, you know, Aave is also going to, you know, take it up a notch.
00:25:09.950 - 00:25:42.738, Speaker A: There's also this new safety module called Umbrella. So this is also very long. I'm not going to bore you with it, but essentially right now, Aave stakers bear the risk of bad debt. So if there's bad debt in an ecosystem, or, sorry, if that. If there's bad debt on Aave, you know, Aave stakers may get slashed. Okay, so let's say there's $10 million with bad debt Aave, the platform will take up to 30% of your staked Aave, and then it'll sell it to cover that backstop. This is not that great, because, I mean, if there's bad debt on Aave, chances are Aave Price is going down.
00:25:42.738 - 00:26:11.340, Speaker A: And then, you know, if people know that Aave is going to sell their token to backstop, it might, you know, create more downward sell pressure, right? Like, people will short, which means that they have to sell more Aave. I mean, it doesn't really make sense, right? It doesn't really scale. So they're going to kill that, right? They're going to be like, you know what? Like, no more of that, no more slashing. But we're going to introduce staked a tokens. So this is. I mean, this makes sense on paper. I'm not sure how it'll actually go, but the idea is, I think Mark told me this.
00:26:11.340 - 00:26:57.378, Speaker A: I think 85% of wallets that use AAvE, they don't really borrow against their assets. They just deposit for the yield, which I thought was kind of interesting. But anyways, when you deposit, let's say, a million dollars with USDC into AAve lending it, you get back a USDC AUSDC is the receipt token. And, you know, you can burn your AUSDC to get USDC back from the protocol. And what umbrella does is that you can stake or restake your AUSDC to earn more yield. So, for example, yeah, before staked Aavi gets sold, and in case about that after stake Aave is no longer gonna be a backstop. But people can restake, let's say they are USDC to earn additional yield and bear the risk of bad debt events.
00:26:57.378 - 00:27:39.196, Speaker A: So let's say USDC, you lend out a million dollars, you're making 5% APY, or 4.8%. But if you're willing to take on more risk, you can restake your USDC and get paid 7% because you're bearing the risk. In case you're basically taking on the risk in case there's bad debt. I don't really think the risk of bad debt is that high on Aave. I think they've really cleaned up their act, and I'm not sure what the rates are going to be, but that's basically going to be how it works. Is there going to be a demand for this? I have no idea, but it's kind of interesting. So, in summary, I literally just bought Aave on July 25, right, the day of the proposal, because of the make read precedents also.
00:27:39.196 - 00:28:00.092, Speaker A: I mean, I didn't even know they were going to propose it, actually. It's kind of funny. Like, I was, like, about to buy Aave, and then it started pumping. I was like, why is it pumping? I'm trying to buy this below $90, and I was like, you know what? I don't care. I'm just gonna buy. And then I checked Twitter, and then there's the proposal. So if I woke up 20 minutes earlier, I could have bought below.
00:28:00.092 - 00:28:12.590, Speaker A: I mean, that's really bad. I bought Aave. I'm staking it. Cool. Staking Aave is kind of annoying. So right now, there is a slashing risk, but I think that risk is very low. And I.
00:28:12.590 - 00:28:34.058, Speaker A: You get paid 4.67% APR from Aave inflation. So, you know, they're emitting aave every single day. But, you know, with the fee switch, they are going to kill the Aave inflation, and, you know, it's all the rate. Right. The APR is going to come from buybacks. One weird thing is this is, like a cool down period on stake.
00:28:34.058 - 00:28:55.302, Speaker A: I didn't even know this. You know, like, so there's a 20 day on period, right? So, you know, let's say you stay coffee and you're like, screw it. Like, I want to get out. You have to wait 20 days, and then you have this period of two days to unstake. And if you don't stake, or so if you don't claim within this period, you have to do the what? Like, you have to go down. I hope they fix this. Right.
00:28:55.302 - 00:29:12.440, Speaker A: This is very annoying. I think people were, like. There were, like, some people that was, like, abusing the system, so they had to implement this. I don't even know what that means, but that's kind of annoying. But I'm staking it, right? Like, I'm not. I am literally staking aave, right? Like, you know, like, that. That is called conviction.
00:29:12.440 - 00:29:32.300, Speaker A: You know, like, I'm not buying this to pump or to, like, sell, like a week from now or a month from now. No, like, I'm literally, like, investing in Aave, you know, and if the facts change, I'll sell and, like. Like, move on. Right. As I've done with, like, my other banks. That's, you know, that people troll me for, but that's. I mean, that's markets, right? It's like, it is what it is.
00:29:32.300 - 00:30:03.896, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm basically making a bet on the Aave EtH bottom and the Aave USD bottom, but I'm more concerned about Aave ETH because if I'm buying Aave and ETH outperforms it, then I feel stupid. So, yeah, mecore precedence is good. It's a high float, low FTV coin. Maybe the FDB is not that low, but it's pretty low, like, relative to the quality of the protocol with proven product market fit. They make money. And maybe this is not a factual statement, it's just more subjective. But it feels like no one owns DeFi.
00:30:03.896 - 00:30:39.650, Speaker A: Everyone thinks it's a bad asset, which is fine. If no one owns it, then it starts going up, then people have to own it or there will be buyers. Generally in crypto, you want to buy things that are reflexive. As it goes higher, it also creates more demand. This is why meme coins get so much. Or people love meme coins, right? It's like, oh, my God, like a meme coin. You can argue a meme coin at 100 million dollar market cap is more bullish than a meme coin is like $2 million mark cap, right? Because as it gets bigger, it's the probability of it becoming a billion dollar coin goes higher.
00:30:39.650 - 00:31:10.954, Speaker A: So, you know, the risk goes lower and there's like reflexivity and momentum. But I also think it applies to Defi. I think people generally understand that DeFi is one of the best, or DeFi has one of the best product fit when it comes to, like, blockchain technology, but no one owns it because they're worthless governance tokens. That has been true. And I'm not saying that all DeFi is going to pump. I think the only DeFi coins that can do well are coins that's going to introduce some form of value accrual. And maker is a good example.
00:31:10.954 - 00:31:42.308, Speaker A: Right? Like Maker introduced value cruel. It was like, you know, it was basically like free money, right? Like you could have spot it. And I don't really think all DeFi is going to do well. I think there has to be specific reasons and catalysts. Even in the broader crypto markets. There's been a lot of dispersion in crypto assets where there's certain sectors that's doing really well, but the majority of sectors are just not doing anything. And I think that also applies in the microeconomic or the microsectors within each sector for DeFi.
00:31:42.308 - 00:32:09.772, Speaker A: You know, I think things like, you know, so, like, the high flow to left tv stuff, things like, you know, maker is good, Aave good, Lido probably good, even though Lido is pretty cursed. Uniswap is not that cheap, but I think it's also good, as they also have a fee switch coming probably next year. So, you know, I think at some point, it's gonna be pretty obvious, I think, in five years. I mean, no one has that long a time. Spanish. Right. In crypto.
00:32:09.772 - 00:32:27.916, Speaker A: But conceptually, Aave at 1.5 is going to, I think. Right. My opinion is going to feel like an incredible buy, let's say, in 2025, 2026. And I'm not trying to time the markets. I mean, I kind of am, but, you know, I'm staking it. Right.
00:32:27.916 - 00:32:52.466, Speaker A: So I'm just more trying to accumulate some of these coins, starting with Aave, because I think it's good value. I hope it's not a value trap. Right. Value investors tend to get wrecked, even in the stock market. So there's a risk that it's a valley trap. But like I said, if there's any point for Aave to put in the bottom, it's going to be this proposal. So I'm happy to put my foot in the arena.
00:32:52.466 - 00:33:09.402, Speaker A: The Aave thesis has been in the works. So, I mean, I don't really talk about it too much on my public channel, because, I mean, I'm not going to make a video saying, hey, like, I'm thinking about this obby thesis. No, like, it's been in the works. I've been talking to Martzeller a lot. I mean, this is from last year, right? It's. Yeah, it's like. Yeah.
00:33:09.402 - 00:33:35.782, Speaker A: Like, he's like, okay, we're gonna turn on the fee switch at some point in 2024. That's my main focus. Right. Kill Aave, yield from ecosystem reserve, start some value crawl. So, in my mind, I've always wanted to buy Aave sometime in 2024, because, you know, like, he's literally telling everybody, right, this is public on Twitter that we're gonna implement a fee switch at some point. So, you know, now that July 25 Facebook proposals live. Cool.
00:33:35.782 - 00:34:07.410, Speaker A: Let me try. And also, you know, if you go to my videos and filter for most popular. My first four videos is literally like, you know, the Polygon Aave days, right? If you look on this video, I have the farmer hat, right? You can see the farmer hat. And I was, like, looping this. I mean, if anyone remembers these times, it was actually insane, right? It was like literally free money, right? Like, if you just showed up, it's free money. And I think a lot of people's light bulb moment for crypto and I guess on chain was through Aave. It's like, wow, aave is incredible.
00:34:07.410 - 00:35:03.390, Speaker A: So we're really going full circle here, right? And like I said, I might buy other defi coins, too, but I start with Aave first. Or I guess I bought Maker last year, and that was good. But now my relationship with Maker is ended, right? Maker is my ex, my new shiny girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever coinfriend is Ave. You know, believe in something, right? Hashtag believe in something I know people are gonna show me, right? Honestly, I don't really care, but, you know, I'm believing in something. Okay? And if there's anyone in the world, right, that can put the bottom in for defi coins, not all of them, right? Only specific, good quality defi coins, it has to be me, right? Like, if not me, who else? Like, no one, right? No one on twitter is gonna buy, like, you know, buy defi coins, right? I mean, they're all, like, showing meme coins. Like, honestly, anyone else on YouTube, it's like, it has to be me, right? So let me. Let me try, right? Let me try.
00:35:03.390 - 00:35:21.278, Speaker A: And if it doesn't work, then it's going to be on my long list of things that didn't work, right? I have a resume full of those things. But, you know, I choose to believe in something. I believe in aave. I believe in the fundamentals. I believe in the cash flows. I believe that it's not a value trap. I believe in Aave.
00:35:21.278 - 00:35:31.994, Speaker A: I believe in money markets. I believe in Defi. I believe in. In the resurgence of these worthless governance tokens. I believe in something. I believe in the tech. And we'll see how it goes.
00:35:31.994 - 00:35:45.530, Speaker A: We'll see how it goes. So if you enjoy the content, please, like, comment, whatever.

00:35:45.530 - 00:35:55.962, Speaker A: I believe in something. Yeah. Wow. This video is 36 minutes. Okay. I thought it was going to be like an hour long, but I guess I'm getting better at these things. But thank you guys for watching.
00:35:55.962 - 00:36:03.282, Speaker A: See you guys another time. And have fun. Either making fun of me or joining me on the Defi bandwagon. Bye.
