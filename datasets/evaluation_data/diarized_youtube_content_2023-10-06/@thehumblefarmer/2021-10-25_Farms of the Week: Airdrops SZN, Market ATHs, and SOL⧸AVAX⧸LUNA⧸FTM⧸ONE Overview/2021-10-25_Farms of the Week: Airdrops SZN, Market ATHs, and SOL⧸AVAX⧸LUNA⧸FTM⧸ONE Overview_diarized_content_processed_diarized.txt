00:00:01.280 - 00:00:20.246, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here and welcome to farmers of the week. Well, I'll be going over the farms I'm currently in, as well as the farms I'm watching. I'll also be discussing some airdrops. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so the markets are looking incredibly hot. October has been the best month for me.
00:00:20.246 - 00:00:36.020, Speaker A: Like, not even close. My phantom two. Sorry, my avalanche to Phantom rotation has been crazy. For those that don't know, I rotated from avalanche to Phantom here. I got a two x. Well, that price of avalanche hasn't really done much right. So no, this month has been crazy.
00:00:36.020 - 00:01:08.250, Speaker A: And it's hard not to fuel euphoric. And obviously when bitcoin and ETH is at all time highs, I'm sure everyone's portfolio, or most people like their portfolio, is near all time highs too. And if you've been in crypto long enough, it's hard not to feel some form of PTSD, especially when Shiba flipped terra and coingecko. This is kind of ridiculous. And obviously, like back in May, like the top, the temporary top, was marked by dotcoins going crazy. And like, no one else was like, buying bitcoin or ETH. And so when bitcoin and ETH crashed, everything else crashed harder.
00:01:08.250 - 00:01:48.976, Speaker A: So it kind of scares me that there's like a lot of retail speculation going into dollar coins. But one metric that I do look at that might provide some insight is like, my YouTube data. Because, you know, my YouTube has grown a lot and. But if you actually look at the data, like, my viewership hasn't really changed, right? And maybe this is because less people care about phantom avalanche, Luna than dotcoins or whatever, but even back then, back in Maine and June when I had roughly 15,000 subscribers, I was getting more views back here. And maybe this was when a lot of new money came in and when they got wrecked, they never came back. Maybe that's not happening. I wouldn't trade around this information, but also look at my subscriber count.
00:01:48.976 - 00:02:21.658, Speaker A: It's kind of crazy, right? I wouldn't count the peak years just because this is when I did the collaboration video with Benjamin Cohen. But, you know, I was obviously there's going to be diminishing returns. Like the, the bigger my channel gets, the more, the more new subscribers I can receive. But no, there's not that much new, right? And maybe this is because defi yield farming isn't really like well known yet, right. People don't really respect farmers and whatnot. But I argue that, like, farmers make the most money because farmers always know what the next rotation is, right? Like avalanche, I knew because I'm a farmer. Phantom, I knew it because I'm a farmer.
00:02:21.658 - 00:02:56.184, Speaker A: And, you know, like, people that were nimble enough were able to capture some upside on the harmony ecosystem as well. But there's that, and there's a lot of bullish narratives for the phantom ecosystem as well. One of the most, I guess, one of the easiest narratives, right, that's going to get retweeted everywhere is this narrative where at $2.71, the phantom incentive program is worth over a billion dollars. Because, you know, with all these incentive programs, you know, these foundations, they're not using dollars, right. They're just using the phantom tokens that they have in the reserve. So if the price of these phantom tokens go up, then obviously these incentive programs are going to be worth a lot more.
00:02:56.184 - 00:03:25.970, Speaker A: And it could be a bullish narrative to get people to buy these tokens. But I'm not a fan of these narratives, right. Because, you know, any narrative that becomes more and more bullish as the price of the token goes up is a dangerous narrative, in my opinion, because I feel like that's, that's the type of narrative that gets people wrecked, right? It's like, oh, tokens going up, it's more bullish. I don't think that's how it works. So, you know, I'm personally going to be taking profits into Phantom soon. You know, it's been a great trade for me. Like, I'm super grateful for phantom ecosystem.
00:03:25.970 - 00:04:00.680, Speaker A: I still argue that they have the best swarms, but, you know, I'm going to start taking profits, right, just to be responsible. And I've also been like, levered long Phantom for a couple weeks now. So I think it's a responsible thing to do. Another bullish narrative that could take on is the Phantom developer conference. It's happening right now, actually, in Abu Dhabi. And I'm not really sure, like, what's happening in here, but Andre Cranier, who's one of the most famous developers in all of Defi, said that, hey, I'm trying really hard not to tweet about Phantom because he doesn't want to leak anything before the conference. So maybe this is another bullish narrative.
00:04:00.680 - 00:04:36.856, Speaker A: To be honest, for myself, I have no desire to sell the top, right. I just want to capture the meat of the move. And though I do think that fandom is technically undervalued relative to other l one s. I'm fine missing out on future upside just so I can raise my stablecoin stack. Because one of my goals for Q four was to have at least 10% of my portfolio into stablecoins. And given the recent pump across everything, my stable coins are getting pretty light. And people underestimate the power of stable coins in crypto and defi because not only do stable coins mitigate your downside risk in crypto, can also earn yield on your stable coins.
00:04:36.856 - 00:05:04.488, Speaker A: My second favorite farm in all of crypto, right after defi kingdoms, is the spell farm on avracadabra on the phantom ecosystem. What you can do is you can click that button, you can go to curve on Phantom, right? And deposit like magic Internet money tether or USDC on here. And then you can stake that. Stake your curve lp tokens here and earn 42.69. That's a funny number. 42.69% on spell, right.
00:05:04.488 - 00:05:44.960, Speaker A: Obviously in hindsight, I was better off, like, buying spell tokens with dollars than like, farming it. But obviously hindsight is 2020 and, you know, any stable coins that I can muster up is literally being thrown in here, right? Because I'm bullish spell. I've made it clear that I'm bullish spell. I don't want to buy spell just to mitigate my downside risk, right? Because I'm super exposed to like, some altcoins. So I'm just really comfortable just taking all. Any stable coins that I can muster up, put it in here, right? Using bitcoin and ethics collateral, borrowing stable coins, putting it in here, taking profits in the phantom, throwing it in here, and just trying to accumulate as many small tokens that I can without, you know, actually buying the tokens, right? Farmer mentality. Okay, so that was one.
00:05:44.960 - 00:06:03.772, Speaker A: That's one of the farms I'm super excited for in the phantom ecosystem. The second farm that I wanted to bring to your attention was Beethoven. Beethoven X. They are a balancer fork on the phantom ecosystem. They actually have a lot of TvL here, let me move my camera. Yeah, it's 260 million Tvl, which is pretty insane. The price of beats dollar 50.
00:06:03.772 - 00:06:37.230, Speaker A: I think the market cap of this is like under 50 million, which is kind of, kind of weird because spooky swap is at over 100 million market cap with half a billion in TVL. Spirit swap over 100 million market cap with a little over 300 million in TVL. Obviously boo. And spirit has more utility than the beats token, right? Like, you can't really do anything with beats I. And you can't just look at TVL and, like, buy things, right? That's not how crypto works. Like, if crypto worked that way, then, like, there would be no alpha, right? Like, you can't just look at TVL to buy tokens. But I still think it's a pretty good farm.
00:06:37.230 - 00:07:00.338, Speaker A: I personally, like, I'm not in this, like, I don't want exposure to the beats token, but if you can farm it with, you know, just being an LP, it could be something to look into. I'm not a fan of being a liquidity provider in this type of bullish environment. Right. Because impermanent loss isn't really worth it, right. You'd rather. You're just, like, much better off capturing the capital gains upside when the markets are just like, in all time highs. But with.
00:07:00.338 - 00:07:31.836, Speaker A: Because this is a balancer fork, it kind of gives you uneven exposure. You don't have to have a 50 50 ratio to be an LP. The Phantom USDC pool has a 70, 70%, 30%, I guess, weighing weighting. So I guess you're still taking on decent phantom exposure while still mitigating your downside a little bit while earning 68% apr. And there are other farms too. And, you know, with balancer, you can also gain exposure to, like, more than. More than two tokens.
00:07:31.836 - 00:07:54.110, Speaker A: There's this, my USDC pool, stablecoin pool. Earning 45% could be interesting. Dance of the DJ's. Me personally, I don't really see any reasons to, like, be a liquidity fighter for, like, eight assets. Like. Like, this just means that, like, you're unsure of what's happening in the market, so you're just like, throwing money around in a bunch of different things. But, you know, it could be something to look into, and I do think it's a pretty good farm.
00:07:54.110 - 00:08:32.864, Speaker A: Okay, that being said, let's talk about the terra ecosystem. And I haven't been covering the terra ecosystem just because, I mean, there's not that many new things you can do, right? I mean, it's a great ecosystem. You can earn great yield. There's a lot of airdrops coming, actually, which I'll go over and. But one thing that I changed was that, you know, like, this net APR for Terra or anchor used to be like 90%, and now it's down to 3% just because there's so much more money going, going into this, which is fine. So I, you know, this wasn't really worth it for me. So I repaid my loan, I got rid of my mirror position, as well, right? I was short forming gold, long forming galaxy, no longer doing it.
00:08:32.864 - 00:09:00.410, Speaker A: I just pulled out and I'm just like, you know, my, my USD is still here. It's always been here. And the anchor tokens that I've informing is being staked here. And if you remember, Nexus protocol was going to airdrop tokens to anchor governance stakers. The website's kind of buggy, so it's not like letting me scroll down and up, but. Oh God. Okay, anyways, I'm not going to go into the website, but Nexus was going to give airdrops to anyone that staked anchor tokens back in September.
00:09:00.410 - 00:09:38.048, Speaker A: You can't do it now, right? Because, you know, you're too late. But you know, I was airdropped Nexus tokens and I'm sure a lot of you were airdropped Nexus tokens as well, if you were anchor governance staker. So let me just move my camera so I don't dox my wallet address. So if you go to this website called terradrops IO, it allows you to claim all your airdrops in one click. And kabam, there it is. I have roughly $550 of Nexus tokens just airdrop to me. So, you know, I think this is, this might be the start of Tara season just because there's a lot, there's a lot of airdrops planned, actually, second of which is the Astro airdrop.
00:09:38.048 - 00:09:54.472, Speaker A: This is something I'm super excited for. Oh God, what is going on? Let me, let me. Oh, lord. Okay, hold on. There you go. That's, that's what I'm trying to do. Okay, so Astro Astroport is an automated automated market maker in the terra ecosystem, right now.
00:09:54.472 - 00:10:49.310, Speaker A: There's terra swap, there's mirror, but you know, it's kind of janky, right? Like, it's not the best experience, but Astro is going to be a new one. They're backed by Delphi Digital and there's a lot of hype around this. And if you actually look into this airdrop that they're going to do, what they're going to do is if you scroll down here, they're going to be retroactively airdropping this astro token to historical participants in major t five protocols. So t five meaning terra finance, right? And there are only two major t five protocols, anchor and mirror. So if you used anchor and mirror for the past, whatever, couple weeks or two months or like whatever, I don't think it mentions, like, when the snapshot was taken, but, you know, I've been in the ecosystem since July. So I'm sure I'll be airdropping some tokens and just letting you know that, hey, like, I'm going to be forming this token because I do think that Astro is going to be a good token. Generally, tokens for the number one decentralized exchange on any ecosystem tends to do well.
00:10:49.310 - 00:11:20.444, Speaker A: And, you know, I think it's a pretty safe bet that Astro is going to outperform, like mirror tokens and whatnot. So there's that. Another token, or I guess another protocol that I'm super excited for is Mars, right? I'm a huge money markets guy. Essentially my entire rotating strategy, my rotation strategy across, like, all these ecosystem has been like, buy tokens for ecosystems that have a trusted money market. And that's kind of worked right now. It's pretty wild. But Mars is going to be an insane money market protocol.
00:11:20.444 - 00:11:36.950, Speaker A: You can use AUSD as collateral. I heard you can use stocks as collateral. They're, I heard they're gonna launch sometime in Q four. Like, I have no idea. But, you know, when this comes out, you know, I'll be aping it for sure. Okay, so let's discuss another airdrop. That's a lot of airdrops happening.
00:11:36.950 - 00:12:11.200, Speaker A: If you're, if you've been an early user in these ecosystems, you're just gonna need a bunch of these tokens. But this is in the Solana ecosystem, right? I rarely talk about Solana. In fact, I bridged to the Solana ecosystem for the first time just so I can get this airdrop. So there's this thing called, there's, I can't speak. There's this thing called Apricot Finance that launched October 19, where early users will be retroactively rewarded for lending, borrowing, and farming activities. So the team mentioned that there will be retroactively airdropping tokens. I'm assuming it's gonna be an airdrop retroactively rewarded.
00:12:11.200 - 00:12:43.860, Speaker A: So for the first couple of weeks, so like two to three weeks, early users will get airdropped. And what apricot is, is a leveraged yield farming protocol. When I did this long overview with Chris McCann, he kind of touched on this too. But essentially what you can do. Let me actually go here. So this is what I'm doing. So I deposit some eth here, and I'm borrowing dollars, right? I'm leveraged yield farming, which sounds dangerous, but, you know, you can, you can, you can deposit Eid, you can, like, leverage yield farm stable coins, 12%, or like, you know, these things.
00:12:43.860 - 00:13:15.816, Speaker A: But if you go to the dashboard, you see that my borrow limit is at 84%. And you might be asking yourself or asking me, like, isn't this dangerous? Like, what if you get liquidated, right? But the power of apricot and the technology. And I guess the. The crazy thing about it is that there's this feature called Apricot assist where if the borrow limit reaches 95%, it will automatically delever your position for you until it gets to 90%. And you can adjust this, right? If I. If I want to be more safe, I can go, like, in. I can change it, like, whatever, right? Maybe if I'm super safe, I don't really trust it because it's a new protocol.
00:13:15.816 - 00:13:44.474, Speaker A: Maybe you can be more safer like this or, you know, like that or something. Yeah, but you know, it's something, right? And even though the rates aren't that great, I'm not really doing this because, you know, like, the rates are amazing. I'm just doing this because there could be an airdrop, or there is an airdrop. And though I might not get too much, I have no idea how much all VR drops, I felt like it was worth it. And bridging the Solana great experience. Everything is super fast, everything is super cheap. And, you know, I'm bullish Solana.
00:13:44.474 - 00:14:27.676, Speaker A: I don't own any solana tokens, but, you know, it's a great ecosystem. Just because I'm on this topic of Solana, I was gonna go over, like, marinated finance. I think this is a pretty cool one where you can stake your solana on here and earn and get back a liquid derivative of a staked solana tokens called msoul, right? So you can stake your soul an msoul. And Msoul is a solana token that's appreciating 7% apy because it's a liquid derivative of a staked solana token. And you can use your marinade, takes Sol on something like port finance, which is the money market, and earn decent yield on that too. So I'm not in this, right? It's not too exciting for me personally, but just wanted to bring it. To bring it to your attention and also, you know, that, like, hey, I'm not neglecting this lana ecosystem.
00:14:27.676 - 00:15:09.226, Speaker A: I love the ecosystem. Okay, so let's talk about avalanche, right? Because, you know, I angered some people rotating away from avalanche three weeks ago. But, you know, I'm thinking about rotating back, right? Because, you know, I didn't rotate out of avalanche because I was bearish, right? I just was more bullish. Phantom, right. It's all about opportunity cost for me. And if you look at the bridging data, like, avalanche is looking pretty good most of these days are net positive, right? And generally, like, if there are more people bridging in to avalanche than there are bridging out, it could be more bullish for the tokens, its tokens itself. Who knows? Like, maybe most of this is stable coins and eth and bitcoin, so no one's buying the avalanche token, right? Maybe all the whales is farming it.
00:15:09.226 - 00:15:49.148, Speaker A: But, you know, it's, it's a, I think it's a good leading indicator. And Joe, Joe Rush right here. Joe Rush is going to be deployed this evening. You're going to have to figure out, like, what time it is in your timezone. But, you know, I, even though I missed out on Trader Joe and has been doing okay, I still think that, you know, if I do rotate into the avalanche ecosystem, I'm not gonna, I'm thinking about gaining, gaining exposure to Joe token. Because back then, yes, yes, I missed it. And then I'm gonna perpetually get pooped on by the community for missing out on Joe.
00:15:49.148 - 00:16:10.416, Speaker A: But it's fine. It is what it is. You can't catch them all. But what's going to happen with Xjo? Is that. Sure. Previously you could stake Joe for XJO and earn like 30% APR or APY. But with bingo Joe and abracadabra integrating x Joe soon, I don't know when, I never know when these things are launching on the avalanche ecosystem.
00:16:10.416 - 00:16:47.362, Speaker A: But X Joe is going to be enabled as collateral, meaning that it's going to give you more utility. I often talk about utility of these tokens, right? Utility of stable coins, utility of bitcoin and eth. Because if I'm holding an asset, I better be able to do something with it, right? Because that's the power of Defi. I don't want to hold something that just sits in my wallet. It doesn't really give me that much utility. So if I, if I can use it as collateral, right? If I can use a yield bearing interest token as collateral, borrow against it, and then form it as tokens, it's going to give me more utility. So extra, you know, even though, you know, I was less bullish on it back here.
00:16:47.362 - 00:17:04.390, Speaker A: Yes, I missed out on it. But, you know, I think it's an interesting play in Wonderland too. I think Wonderland is interesting. And I'm in the mindset where I'm okay missing out on Wonderland if it keeps pumping, but if it dumps hard. I'm a buy. I'm a buy, right? Cause I'm part of frog nation. Okay.
00:17:04.390 - 00:17:32.755, Speaker A: So few more things I want to touch on was, you know, the Defi kingdoms giveaway, right? This is a, this is a cool one. I'm really happy by, like, how a lot of people were, like, you know, super happy or super excited for Defi kingdoms because it's one of my highest conviction farms, and the price of Juul is at all time high. It's pretty, pretty wild. So I just wanted to let you know that. Hey, Tom. Tom did respond back, right? Tom? Oh, God. I don't know Doc's email, but Tom did respond back, and he's gonna get the giveaway.
00:17:32.755 - 00:18:07.730, Speaker A: I'm gonna have a call with him this week just to give him. Give him his NFT. I don't know what the price of this NFT is, but I just wanted to let everyone know that he's going to claim it. Also, near offered a $100 million grant for Defi Mindshare defi incident program. I mean, like, if you're a farmer, like, we're just celebrating, right? Because even if you're not bullish, near, like, if they're going to give you free tokens, like, you might as well take it. So, you know, there's a lot going on. I feel like 2021 2022 is just a good time to be a farmer, right.
00:18:07.730 - 00:18:28.398, Speaker A: Because all these ecosystems, they have a lot of money. They want your liquidity, and they're just going to pay you to bridge over. Okay, so that's the end of the video to, I guess, to wrap it up. I wanted to quickly touch on my private discord. Right. We're almost at a thousand members. It's been great.
00:18:28.398 - 00:19:05.408, Speaker A: And I just wanted to give, like, a brief teaser on, like, what's available there in case you were interested. So I have this notion this isn't the only thing. There's also discord, too, where I post every day, but this is kind of where you can get a view into, like, what I do or like, how, what I'm considering. So I'm not gonna go over this in too much detail, but, you know, like, my top, top holdings, like, what I'm farming, what I'm considering, and, like, what I'm researching. Right. Stuff like that. And then in the tool section, you can look at my past videos to look at, hey, like, what have I done in the past? So I guess you can check this, like, for my track record.
00:19:05.408 - 00:19:26.320, Speaker A: But I was early to harmony. I was only phantom you know, I feel like I, I mean, I essentially like research like seven days a week. So I feel like I have a better pulse in the markets than a lot of other people do. So, you know, this is just like a quick, I guess, teaser, I guess, on like what's available. I post videos twice a week. I do a live stream once a month. I post on discord every day.
00:19:26.320 - 00:20:07.396, Speaker A: So you know this discord isn't meant for beginners, right? I mean you can join as a beginner and I'm sure you can, like, I guess learn quick, like more quickly through the discord than like, you know, just like trying to do it yourself. But you know, I'm not going to make tutorial videos in the discord, right? I'm more targeting people that already know how to farm, that want to like up their farming game and I guess be early on the trends. So if this interest, if, if this is interesting, check out the private discord link will be in the description below. You know I don't run ads on my channel, right? I'm not a page show. So I have a different business model where other people, they do clickbait. They make money off from ads and referral links. I get paid up based on how much alpha I provide.
00:20:07.396 - 00:20:13.300, Speaker A: So that's it. Thank you guys watching. Hope you clean these airdrops and have fun from it out there.
