00:00:01.080 - 00:00:21.014, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Techie here. And today I just wanted to give my holistic view on markets for bitcoin and ether and my thoughts on the echo bubble. Also, we've seen one of the largest airdrops in history of crypto with blur, right? Airdropping tokens. On Valentine's Day, I got some tokens. I sold my blur. But I'll talk about why I did that. And I guess the pros and cons of the blur token.
00:00:21.014 - 00:00:49.108, Speaker A: And I guess while we're on that topic, I'll also talk about why I think NFTs and Defis is converging together is inevitable and a lot of airdrop farming opportunities for NFT finance projects and why I think I'm pretty positive that sector. So let's get right into it. Another financial advice, if you like the content, please like and subscribe. Link to the premium discord is in the description below. And I hold these tokens as of February 27 today. So let's talk about that. Go bubabble.
00:00:49.108 - 00:01:33.260, Speaker A: People are saying, or, you know, in crypto, there's this concept of the four year cycle primarily due to the bitcoin halving. And we saw this crazy strength in crypto in the month of January. And people are comparing 2023 to 2019, because in 2019, if you're in the markets back then, markets went down only in 2018, and then in 2019 from January to basically early July, the market just literally went up only. And obviously, as a bull, you want to see this happen. Of course, I don't really expect history to repeat, but it does often rhyme. And crypto is a very reflexive asset class. So if enough people believe that this is, this has some potential, then I actually think that it can actually happen.
00:01:33.260 - 00:02:07.196, Speaker A: And there's a lot of similar analogs between 2019 and 2023. So let's talk about that first. So I've covered this before, but, you know, there was tether FuD, right? There's like always FuD. And there's a saying, bull markets climb a wall of worry. Because if you basically, if you basically transition from a bear market to a bull market, of course at the bottom there's so much bad news. And even as the markets recovered, there's going to continue to be bad news. And if we are entering a new bull market, then, you know, you want the markets to shrug off the bad news and, you know, have more buyers step in every time there is a dip.
00:02:07.196 - 00:02:43.120, Speaker A: And for example, on April 25, the New York prosecutors alleged that Bitfinex covered a billion dollars of like, losses using tether funds, and this led to a 14% to 15% correction in the price of BTC. Just imagine, like, the market psychology back then. Bitcoin went from three k to six k. There's tether Fud. Everyone's calling for the end of crypto, but markets kind of wall of worry. And, like, ten days later, bitcoin was putting in new local highs, and it was literally up only from that point to late June ish. And recently, there's been a lot of regulation FUD, I think.
00:02:43.120 - 00:03:07.648, Speaker A: I mean, we should all expect regulation FUD, especially after what happened in 2022. There was Operation Choke point, basically the government restricting banking access for crypto startups. No rumors around that. There was also USDC FUD, right, like USDC potentially being a security busd. Paxos. Right, or bUsd, basically, you know, being sunset. And also no centralized exchange staking fud kraken.
00:03:07.648 - 00:03:37.352, Speaker A: Right. I think got sued by the SEC, and they're getting rid of their staking services and Coinbase. Right. They're taking a stand and they're trying to protect, you know, one of their most profitable business sectors, which is, you know, centralized exchange staking, because I think they take, like, a 25% fee for each staking, which is pretty insane. And when all of this news was, you know, in the grapevine, people heard about it. This led to a 12% correction in the price of BTC. And similar to 2019, it was immediately engulfed and we were putting in new local highs, like, ten days later.
00:03:37.352 - 00:04:33.742, Speaker A: Of course, you know, we're not experiencing, like, up only to similar to, like, you know, 2019 primarily due to, like, maybe macro conditions, regulation flood, right. Being more scary. But the analogies are there. And, you know, can something like 2019 echo bubble repeat in 2023? And like I mentioned, you know, basically, like, you kind of want to see bad news, right? And this is like, you know, part of, like, the reasons I've been looking for Fud because, I mean, markets don't go down for no reason. Of course, people sell when there's bad news or, like, a scary headline or, like, for whatever reason. But typically, you know, 10% corrections, like, happen when, you know, there's, like, fud in the markets. But, you know, for, like, for me to have more confidence in the sustainability of, I guess, this short to medium term bull market that crypto might be seeing is, you know, for, you know, these bad news to be absorbed by buyers because crypto has been literally up only this year, right.
00:04:33.742 - 00:05:07.532, Speaker A: So practically, you know, I would expect buyers to come in every ten to 15% dip the moment bitcoin loses. Right? Like, loses that and, like, dumps 20%. I would be much more worried. But practically speaking, right? Like, is this even fud? Like, we knew that stabilization Fud was coming anyways. Of course, USDC being a security would really hurt the markets, but I don't really see, like, how, like, that makes any sense. And I think the biggest fud or that led to, like, the biggest, you know, price drop was the centralized exchange staking Fud. But in the grand scheme of things, like, like, does that even matter? Right? It's like some.
00:05:07.532 - 00:05:42.170, Speaker A: Some, like, random dude in Iowa, Idaho, right? Like, they can't stake their eat with Kraken. Like, who cares, right? I mean, it's like, primarily. I mean, it's obviously more bullish. Things like Lido FXs and I'll talk about those later, but I actually think it makes the case for defi much better. Right? I mean, even Coinbase, if they keep their staking product, they take a 25% cut and I get the convenience aspect of it, right. It's like, you know, you get your parents to buy eth, you stake it on Coinbase. It's much simpler than, you know, buying eth, bridging it to metamask, and then, like, staking it with, like, Lido.
00:05:42.170 - 00:06:18.190, Speaker A: But, you know, I mean, I think LSD's are going to continue to be a really strong narrative throughout this year, especially with the Shanghai update coming late March to early April. So let's talk about echo bubble and how I'm thinking about it is like, you know, if you think about the amount of selling that we've seen in 2022, it was. It was pretty incredible, right? FTX, three ac. I mean, everything went poorly. And, you know, we saw some. We saw like a crescendo of panic post FTX. And I think the way the markets have rebounded so far is pretty constructive.
00:06:18.190 - 00:06:51.860, Speaker A: But I'm not really expecting, like, new all time highs, like the beginning of the new bull market from my perspective, of course. I mean, there's always a possibility that this is the beginning of the bull market. But, like, in my mind, this is how I think about it. Either we're in the early stages of the next bull market or we're in the middle to late innings of a bear market rally. So if that's going to be the case, I think in either scenario, it makes sense for me to be long. I mean, I've been long all year. So I'll talk about, like, hedging and taking profits later.
00:06:51.860 - 00:07:07.336, Speaker A: But that's kind of my view. Of course, if the data changes, I have to, like, adjust and whatnot. But no, I'm still in let it ride mode, right. I mean, I see fud. I'm like, okay, I'm going to just drink some beer and just go to sleep. It's like, I don't really care. I expect fud.
00:07:07.336 - 00:07:35.346, Speaker A: And so far, I've liked the reaction by the market so far. And like I mentioned, crypto is very reflexive. Like, imagine, right? Like, the month of February stays flat, month of march ends up green. And if we, right, if we approach, like, 30k, people are going to be saying, oh, my God, like, echo bubble. Like 30K is like, not going to be resistance. And you might wonder, like, okay, like, how can 30k not be resistance, right? Because it's a round number. You know, we saw some buying here.
00:07:35.346 - 00:08:21.168, Speaker A: This was basically when three Ac cap Joy, right, but also right if you. I mean, you can say anything to, like, fit your biases. But on a similar note, people were saying six k is like this infinite cell wall because we bounced there like so many times. But in this echo bubble, right, we just, like, went straight through. So, you know, the markets go higher, people are always going to be moving goal posts. So I think the best thing to do right now is like, like, at least for me, I'm just like saying, okay, like, if we see, like the second leg or if you see like another leg for bitcoin ether, I have to really seriously consider taking profits, right? Because I think we're like, if we're doing the similar analogy to the echo bubble, I think we're like, we're like both roughly here because this was also when we saw tether fud. But I don't really expect, like, you know, six months of up only action.
00:08:21.168 - 00:09:18.084, Speaker A: That just kind of seems unreasonable. But my thinking is, if a bunch of people believe that we're going to see a six month echo bubble, then maybe it's best to just start selling in April, maybe even starting March. Or, you know, I'm definitely, like, starting to consider, like, how do I start taking profits in something? Not because I'm bearish like my old coins that I hold or like just crypto in general, but, you know, just for risk management, I, like, hold barely any cash right now. So, you know, I just have to protect myself for the downside. And one thing I've been looking at, and I'm not even sure, I mean, there's always, like these random narratives and some really bad narratives that you should ignore. And I've been seeing this China narrative where in 2021, in May, the first stop in bitcoin was basically catalyzed by China banning bitcoin mining. And now it seems like the east is taking a more favorable stance to crypto.
00:09:18.084 - 00:10:05.738, Speaker A: If you actually, like, read articles around the Hong Kong story, it's not really providing full access to crypto for every retail participant. It's more for institutions. But maybe this has some merit, because if you view crypto as a barometer for, I guess, global liquidity, maybe as China injects more liquidity into the ecosystem or into the economy, and people have, I guess, more capital to, I guess, buy risk assets, then maybe they're going to buy more risk assets. And chinese stocks have been doing really well. And this is just my subjective experience, but let's say a month or two ago, I lurk all these discords. But no, there's barely any activity. Of course, as price goes up, there's more activity.
00:10:05.738 - 00:10:34.568, Speaker A: But I've noticed in the past couple of weeks that the chinese section of discords have gotten a lot more active. I can't really read Chinese. I mean, I'm japanese, so I can kind of, I can kind of understand what they're saying, but I just thought it was kind of interesting and. But always. But also, right. Even if China is injecting liquidity, you know, the Fed is going to continue to raise rates. The market's currently pricing in the Fed going to five and a quarter to five and a half, and just staying there, maybe some, you know, probability of, like, even them going higher.
00:10:34.568 - 00:11:34.204, Speaker A: And of course, if the cost of capital is much higher, if the risk free rate is roughly 5%, then there's not really going to be that much demand to bridge stable coins on chain, because if you go to aave, you get paid 2%. Why am I taking on that risk? Of course, if you provide liquidity, you can earn 10%, 12%. But I would expect the majority of people to just, if they want stable coin yield, this is probably the best stablecoin yield on risk adjusted return basis. Of course, this is, like, not great, but, you know, like, from my perspective, if you think about it, it's like if defy TVL has been relatively sticky throughout 2022, I mean, it's not really sticky, right? I mean, money definitely left the left the ecosystem, but that was also when rates were going from like zero to like 4.5%, right? I mean, that Delta is pretty insane. But now, like, going from four and a half to five five and a quarter. Five and a half.
00:11:34.204 - 00:12:04.596, Speaker A: Of course, that's, you know, it's gonna restrict the amount of new capital coming in. But I would expect, like, whatever money is on chain, right? Like, whatever money is in crypto right now is relatively sticky. Okay. Like, my thing is, like, if people survive the 2022 bear market, like, you know, I feel like it's way too early to leave. Right? I mean, you know, I mean, yeah, I mean, that's kind of my thinking, but like I said, yeah, like, these bitcoin yields are, like. Is the good stuff. Definitely the good stuff.
00:12:04.596 - 00:12:33.516, Speaker A: And in terms of stablecoin inflows, I've been covering this for, like, the past couple of months, ever since the FTX collapse. This looks bad, but this is also because it contains busd. And as you can see, when FTX plus it was like 23 billion, and now it's down over 50%. This is. I mean, this is because, you know, Paxos is, you know, getting rid of USD because the SaC went after them. So I don't think this is, like, the best barometer. So if you get rid of busd, it looks more like this.
00:12:33.516 - 00:13:11.550, Speaker A: And, I mean, it's not great still, but FTX day, right? USDC Markia, 42 billion. Right? Like, roughly the same a couple days ago. This is every four days, right? So, you know, every four days. Tether, 69.51. Now it's 71. And as you can see recently, and if you go back to this, this post, I don't know if you can see the date, but this is like roughly February 15. And I just, like, thought it was interesting that there's some confluence in terms of roughly around February 15, 16th, we've started to see a crazy influx of stable capital.
00:13:11.550 - 00:13:42.416, Speaker A: Of course, this might be due to busd. People sell their buSD into USDC or Dai or tether or whatever, but also busd started going down. I mean, basically, like, post FTX. And it seems like stablecoin inflows are picking up. And if you look at the total market cap of stablecoins on FTX day, it was like 112, and now it's like, back to 113. So maybe we're putting in new local highs in the stablecoin market cap. Of course, there's so much noise here.
00:13:42.416 - 00:14:24.786, Speaker A: I'm not really saying this because I think this is, like, super bullish, but, you know, I think us westerners, like, we don't really know what's happening in Asia and China, right? It's like, I get a bunch of information from Twitter, but you know, like, chinese people don't use Twitter. They use weChat. So we don't really have good optics on what's happening over there. But, like, when you look at this data, it makes me think that, okay, like, maybe, you know, China injecting, like, liquidity into the economy is actually having an effect on more people getting into crypto, because, I mean, like, I. If you look at the metrics, most of my viewers are, like, american, but crypto is a global asset class. So I do think it's important to just keep in touch with what's happening in the entire world. Cool.
00:14:24.786 - 00:14:58.490, Speaker A: So, quick summary of the first two months of 2023. It's been up only, right? There's been some fud recently, but I think the monthly candle for bitcoin Eid is basically flat. So the fact that bitcoin went up 40% in January and this flat in the month of February, I think it's constructive. I think it's just consolidating. But the risk is, like, a lot of the degens, like myself, I mean, maybe I'm not. I mean, you know, it's all subjective, but I've had a wide margin of error. You know, if you just, like, bought something in January, then, like, chances are, like, you're up, right? It's very, very hard to not be up.
00:14:58.490 - 00:15:41.040, Speaker A: I still think that in this market environment, you know, you have to go for high conviction bets. You know, whenever bitcoin goes down 2%, altcoins get wrecked. So if you want to be allocated to risk in crypto, all coins and whatnot, you kind of have to try to outperform bitcoin in ether. So. And, like, in order for you to do that, I just think you have to have, like, high conviction, right? You have to put in the work, put in the research, so that, you know, if there is, like, a 20, 30% correction, which is inevitable for most altcoins, you're going to want to be able to, like, hold on to that, because if you don't have conviction, then you're just going, like, dump it, right? Because everyone's just, like, trying to flip these random altcoins. So I'm not really chasing pumps. And ultimately, like, my risk tolerance is very high.
00:15:41.040 - 00:16:02.760, Speaker A: It's not that I have a high risk appetite, but I just. I'm, like, just not as risk averse as, like, the average person. I think maybe it's due to my poker background. I've, like, lost so much money before, you know, maybe not gambling, but, you know, playing poker. So you know, if I think that the risk was worth it, then I would like, I don't really have trouble piling in and, you know, just. Just, like, let everything ride. Right.
00:16:02.760 - 00:16:49.460, Speaker A: So, you know, just because I'm doing that doesn't mean that you should. I mean, I definitely think that the markets are way more risky than it was a couple weeks ago or even like, two months ago. So, you know, I think there's reasons to be cautious. So let's talk about, like, hedging strategies. So, you know, before, I guess, before I get into that, my outlook, March and beyond, is, I think, I mean, I think it's quite possible that the majority of gains that we're going to see in 2033 has been front run. Of course, we're going to see random altcoins go on crazy runs in whatever sectors, but for the average coin, maybe the majority of the gains have been front run in this quarter. Before we get to your fork, like I mentioned earlier, if prices go higher, everyone's going to be moving goalposts.
00:16:49.460 - 00:17:30.970, Speaker A: I just think it makes sense to start thinking of de risking and or hedging plans because, like I mentioned, if you're going with 30k, everyone's gonna be calling for 40k, right. If you go to 40k, we're gonna be calling for fifty k. At some point, you have to draw the line. Maybe that's too bearish. Maybe we're gonna see all time highs, but I just, like, have a hard time believing that. So my strategy is q one, focusing on capital gains, maybe not q one, maybe, like, january and February and then parts of March focus on capital gains, and maybe q two to q four focused on, like, more yield and hedging strategies. I know people know me as, like, some defi guy, and, like, you know, they expect, like, farming content, but, you know, most farming products or, you know, most farming.
00:17:30.970 - 00:18:20.016, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Like, most of the old farming, probably not worth the risk, especially given the risk free rate. So, you know, I'm much more interested in, you know, finding good spots to bet on and also, you know, finding, like, good hedging strategies that also pay me a yield. So let's talk about that hedging strategies and the Domino's pizza benchmark. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of ridiculous, but the Domino's pizza benchmark is something I thought of yesterday as I was eating some pizza. And sometimes, I mean, the benchmark says that sometimes it's best to conceptualize a token's valuation by comparing a market cap to a real world company that, you know, because crypto, very reflexive. It's very hard to, like, value these things because it's, you know, it's all momentum narrative.
00:18:20.016 - 00:18:59.040, Speaker A: I mean, some tokens have fundamentals, but, you know, depending on the app, like, you know, depending on the sector you're in, right? It's just, like, purely hype. And one thing I like to look at is the Domino's pizza market cap, okay? So it's roughly 10 billion. And I think we can all agree that Domino's pizza has some value. Okay? As a college student used to, you know, I think there was, like, a, you know, two medium topping pizzas, $8 each, takeout only, you know, like, I definitely did that, like, a couple times a month in college. Okay, not anymore, right? Not anymore. I'm too old for Domino's. Maybe that's a controversial statement, but, you know, $10 million, right? I think Domino's is value.
00:18:59.040 - 00:19:29.524, Speaker A: Do I want exposure to the stock? Right. As you can see, the market. Yeah. Like, you know, it has a staking rate, right? If you buy Domino's pizza and you stake it on their website, you get a 1.63% APY real yield, right? It's paying real yield, right? People from arbitrum love real yield, but, you know, like, I don't really care about dividend yield, right? And this is also, like, a good idea to also think about for crypto. It's like, just because an asset is paying yield doesn't make it good. And just because an asset is not paying yield doesn't make it bad.
00:19:29.524 - 00:19:49.984, Speaker A: Okay? So there's that. And know one thing. I. I mean, one of the Taiki favorites, right? The channel favorite, as in, like, a token to short, has been avalanche. And avalanche. Market cap of roughly five, let's say 6 billion, right? With an fdv of 13 billion. Maybe fdv is a meme.
00:19:49.984 - 00:20:28.446, Speaker A: But I think when you're valuing these projects like a company, I think it's useful to use the FDV because, I mean, that's the total amount of tokens. And the question I ask everyone is, is avalanche worth more than Domino's pizza? I don't know. I don't know. Right? It's like, I can't really eat avalanche, right? It's like, it doesn't really fill me up. But if blockchain is the future of finance, then, yeah. I mean, yeah, like, you know, why would a blockchain not be worth more than some random pizza joint? But also. Right, like, in this environment, like, know, whenever, like, if avalanche is worth more than Domino's pizza.
00:20:28.446 - 00:20:45.406, Speaker A: I just feel like, you know, maybe there's not that much upside left. Okay. Yeah. Because if avalanche two x is from here, then avalanche is worth two domino's pizzas. Actually, maybe. Maybe. Yeah, maybe that's possible, right? Like, I mean, you know, you kind of have to project future.
00:20:45.406 - 00:21:11.966, Speaker A: I don't know, like, onboarding, you know, web3. Right? Whatever. Because right now, like, you can take your one Avax and you can buy, you know, two one topping pizzas. You know, maybe that's real world utility. I mean, I remember a time when, like, you know, one avax got me, like, 16 pizzas, right? But now it only pays for two. Okay? Like, that is what you call inflation, right? It's awful stuff because, like, November 21, 128, right? I think I did the bad. Yeah.
00:21:11.966 - 00:21:54.626, Speaker A: So, yeah, one Avax could get you 16 one topping pizzas from Domino's, right? Takeout. Only now it can only buy you two. I think. I think it's pretty reasonable, actually. So my concept is if avalanche, right, gets to the hedge zone, of course, I don't mind shorting avalanche now, just as a hedge, not because I want to make money on the short side, but if avalanche goes down, chances are my other altcoins are going down, so at least I get to protect some downside. So what I'm thinking is, like, if avalanche enters, let's say that 30 to 40, $50 range, that is the one I'm going to be shorting avalanche. And if you look at the start, it might seem like that's a long way out.
00:21:54.626 - 00:22:20.754, Speaker A: But if you take it out a log, it looks like this. Okay? Like, people are, you know, crazy excited about this. I mean, I think, you know, generally, the markets can go much higher. I don't even know if Avx can go there, right. But I'm just saying that if it gets there, right, that's going to be prime short, right? At least for me. And I'm not going to short it outright if you've been following me, you know the strategy. But, you know, if we do enter the hedge zone, I would expect a bunch of coins to be up ibu fork.
00:22:20.754 - 00:22:39.094, Speaker A: But, you know, I have to force myself to take some profits. Maybe it makes sense to be more heavier allocated to majors, you know, maybe stake some Ethan whatnot, raise some cash. And, like, how I would hedge is to, you know, raise more cash, okay. Because I need. I don't have that much cash anymore. Deposit that on aave. Right? Use this collateral.
00:22:39.094 - 00:23:11.002, Speaker A: Borrow avax to buy GOP. So you know, if avalanche goes down, then the value of my debt is lower than the GOP balance. So I would make money if the markets go down, but if avalanche pumps, then I lose money on the hedge. But that's fine, because I would expect my other altcoins to outperform Avax. So that's kind of my outlook. It's like, I still think there's some juice left in the markets, but, you know, the higher price goes, the more cautious we should become. And, of course, nothing's guaranteed.
00:23:11.002 - 00:23:34.116, Speaker A: Nobody knows what's going to happen. But this is just my market view in terms of being risk on right now. Focus on capital gains. And as we approach the month of March, month of April, I'm going to be looking to take things off and just de risk across the board, and I'm not going to go 100% cash. Right. I don't think that makes any sense, but I'll be more selective in types of things I'm buying GOP, there's always fud around it. But, hey, like I mentioned, I.
00:23:34.116 - 00:24:05.722, Speaker A: The green line, which is a GLP supply, is going up and to the right, which means that more and more people are buying in the GLP. And there's. I mean, yeah, there's always fudge, but I'm not really fazed by it. But Dyor and I guess no thinking about the domino's pizza benchmark. What about Lido? Right? Like, Lido one of the strongest coins this year. I still think it has more upside, to be honest. I know that I was, like, kind of bearish lido eth like, a month ago, but as soon as, like, the SEC staking or SEC suing Kraken, right.
00:24:05.722 - 00:24:16.070, Speaker A: That news came out. I'm like, oh, yeah. Like, that's super bullish lido. So, you know, I'm. I no longer believe that Lido is overextended relative to ether. And if you look at the FPV of Lido, it's 3.2 billion.
00:24:16.070 - 00:24:39.120, Speaker A: And I guess, like, the one comp I found was for Victoria's Secret. Is Lido worth more than Victoria's secret? Probably, right? Probably. Basically the monopoly of the Eid staking services. Probably worth more than a lingerie company. But, you know, you know, I'm happy to be wrong, right. It's like, you know, maybe. Maybe this is a good buy at this point, right? Putting in higher lows.
00:24:39.120 - 00:25:09.648, Speaker A: Yeah. So I shared this before, right? Lido. This is the Lido eth chart. Lido eth tends to, like, go up a lot and then just gets distributed, right, historically. And I thought maybe it's gonna happen here too, but obviously post Coinbase news, it's just and super strong, or post the staking fud news and I would still expect it has more upside. And I really don't mind like, if I'm entering a coma and I want some defi exposure like Lido and Defxs definitely would be in my part of my portfolio. So enough about that.
00:25:09.648 - 00:25:38.850, Speaker A: Let's talk about. Oh, yeah, enough about lingerie and pizza. Let's talk about blur. I've been hyping up blur for the last couple of months, or maybe like since last month, and it did not disappoint. It was brilliant. I actually got some, you know, like, don't worry, ir's, I'm going to pay my taxes and 6851 blur, this was a pretty nice stimulus check. Not gonna lie, I don't even think I bought that many nfts, but I still got like, you know, this much.
00:25:38.850 - 00:26:01.630, Speaker A: So it pays to use these platforms. And I'll talk about more NFT finance airdrop opportunities later in the video. But let's talk about Bloor first. So before I talk about that, I mentioned that, hey, if blur gives me money, I'm going to give back to the ecosystem by buying some nfts. So I sold blur at like $1.20, convert it into ether. So I got like $8,000.
00:26:01.630 - 00:26:29.426, Speaker A: I took like $7,000, and I swept the floor of this and I kept like a $1,000. I'm like, okay, like, cool. So let's talk about botto. Not gonna lie now, being honest, like, this was probably a mistake, but hey, you know, you have to at least try. So Bado is a decentralized, autonomous artist governed by the people. Kind of sounds like fuzzy, like, you know, like B's, you know, like whatever. But actually it's pretty interesting.
00:26:29.426 - 00:26:55.470, Speaker A: So basically the concept is there's a bado token, and there are these pipes. I don't know how to say that, but, you know, they're like these pipes. And if you hold those, you can stake it and you can basically vote on the type of art that this AI artist is going to make. I'll provide some links in the description below for, like, how it actually works. And of course, like, you know, I don't really believe in, like, the AI hype right now. Right in the year 2023. I think it's gonna be like a longer term thing.
00:26:55.470 - 00:27:41.996, Speaker A: But this only caught my attention because the very first artwork for this collection sold for three hundred k and the second one sold for four hundred k, and the first five to ten art pieces sold for six figures. And, you know, this is by the AI artist. And right now, I think there's, like, a new season right now. But the last season there was a discount fragmentation and they sold for ten to 20k on average. So how it works is every single week, the bottle artist has, like, an auction on the website called super rare, and 85% of the revenues goes to token holders and basically bottle stakers. So it just caught my attention because, you know, AI crypto, NFT, right. It's just like a bunch of buzzwords with a bunch of hype.
00:27:41.996 - 00:28:03.810, Speaker A: So I wanted some exposure to it. I don't want to buy, like, most of these tokens because it's kind of like, you know, it's kind of like pumping, pump and dumpy. So I was like, okay, like, cool, I'll buy that pipe. Okay, like, I'll buy that pipe. Like I mentioned, it's probably a mistake. Yeah. So 85% of the auction proceeds goes to the DAO, and 85% of, like, $10,000.
00:28:03.810 - 00:28:23.150, Speaker A: Not. Not that much. Right. But the fact that this artwork is actually selling for real money just made it interesting. And my ens for my NFT portfolio is farmer taiki eight. So if you want to see my NFT collection, you can check that out. And, you know, like, I'm not really planning to sell these pipes.
00:28:23.150 - 00:28:36.170, Speaker A: I bought, like, 30 of them. And, yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna lie. Like, I wish I had Eid instead of these pipes. But, you know, we'll live. Yeah, that's a. I got a free stimulus check, so I'll see what the floor.
00:28:36.170 - 00:28:48.950, Speaker A: It's funny because I. I swept 30, and the floor went from, like, 0.12 to, like, 0.19, and now it's back to, like, 0.12. And, you know, these. These pipes are liquid af. So, you know, I definitely cannot sell.
00:28:48.950 - 00:29:14.146, Speaker A: I think the bottle token is interesting, too, but I was like, okay, like, I'll buy these ERC 1155s. Like, my. Like, why not? Yeah. Like, in hindsight, I think I just rather have more e, even USDC. But, hey, you know, like, the best way to understand what it's like to own a bunch of illiquid jpegs is throwing a bunch of liquid jpegs, right? Like, I own, like, 1% of the supply. I can't even sell. Right.
00:29:14.146 - 00:29:38.122, Speaker A: It's like, oh, my God. Like, you know, these are soil liquid, but that's one of the problems that blur is fixing. Okay. I think, you know, I've been mentioning that since, I guess, last year. One of the easiest bets, I think, to make for 2023 is open sea losing market share. And, I mean, that's already happening as blur basically flipped opensea. And Opensea is, looks like they're panicking, to be honest.
00:29:38.122 - 00:30:19.796, Speaker A: And on February 7, I talked about this, and the reason I've been bullish NFT marketplace tokens is because no one wants to buy nfts. Right? Like, I literally swept the floor for those pipes. And I feel bad, but I want NFT exposure, but I don't want to buy nfts. I mean, I'm buying nfts for the sake of buying nfts so I can experiment. But ideally, I want to buy liquid fungible eRC twenty s. And I think the majority of people in crypto feel the same way. So my thesis, my argument was that if there is, like, a token for an NFT marketplace that has any semblance of fundamental value, I think that they're going to require or they're going to have, like, a pretty high multiple and people are going to be willing to buy those tokens.
00:30:19.796 - 00:30:40.960, Speaker A: And I think it can surprise a lot of people. And that's basically the thesis and blur, right? I mean, it went to like a dollar 20. I mean, it's. Let's actually look at blur. Yeah. I mean, yeah, it pumped a lot, actually. It's like one of the few times I actually sold the top, but I actually think it can go higher.
00:30:40.960 - 00:31:12.182, Speaker A: But, I mean, you know, this was like a pretty crazy. I mean, yeah, like, you know, $8,000. Like, pretty. Okay, but let's get back to the section. So, as expected, NFT activity has gone up a lot. But I'm a little worried because my thesis around being bullish nfts this year was for a bunch of these tokens to come out to incentivize liquidity, incentivize volume, and hopefully that can lead to some NFT bull market. And of course, it's only been like, I mean, it hasn't even been two weeks since Blur dropped.
00:31:12.182 - 00:31:52.258, Speaker A: So I think it's way too early to tell whether I'm gonna be right or wrong. But I wish there was, like, more organic activity because right now, yes, blur volume is insane, but it's mostly watch trading. It's mostly people farming the airdrop. People saw how much money, like, season one, farmers got, and now that they're season two, everyone is going hand over heels. But you know, I don't really see new people getting into nfts. So for example, volume is up only, but the amount of unique users, not that great. So it's really just whales like market making on blur and just like, you know, collecting these points, which is fine because it's making nfts more liquid.
00:31:52.258 - 00:32:18.212, Speaker A: And, you know, I still think it's like a really good time to get into nfts right now. But ideally you want, like, I don't really care about. I'd rather see unique uses go up than like volume. I mean, ideally both go up, right? But yeah. And the amount of flippers on blur, these, I mean, some, like, most of these screenshots are from punk 9059 on Twitter. From the proof collective shout outs to the proof team. They make amazing content but, you know, shout out to him.
00:32:18.212 - 00:33:13.372, Speaker A: But the amount of flippers on blur, basically all time highs and flippers are defined by people that buy and sell or buy an NFT and sell it the same day. So people flipping within 24 hours. And this is primarily because blur is incentivizing buying, listing and setting bids. So whales are basically incentivized to maximize the amount of volume that they do and not lose too much money and hope that whatever blur token that they get in the future is going to be worth more than whatever they've lost. Totally reasonable. A bunch of people in the NFT community I've talked to is kind of upset by this. I mean, I don't really think it's a big deal, but I understand the frustration just because the majority of the supply for these very liquid collections are controlled by or like the majority of the volume is basically swast trading.
00:33:13.372 - 00:33:42.656, Speaker A: So in the case of Petchu penguins, which I own, you kind of see the stirrup like staircase where it's like no consistent volume. Like up down, up flat, up flat up. Oh my God. And then everyone just nukes it back to its original price. So there's like zero volatility in the NFT markets recently there was some because, you know, someone capitulated like Machi big brother. But, you know, like it's basically back to this being flat. Like I said, I don't think it's a bad thing.
00:33:42.656 - 00:34:04.368, Speaker A: I think it actually gives more liquidity for people to, you know, enter this space. But yeah, like, like I said, like there's like no volatility. Like things are not going up. And for an NFT bull market to happen, right. Like there has to be more new users and I don't really see that yet. Yeah, as you can see, blur token dropped. Everyone's surprised, and now everyone wants to farm it.
00:34:04.368 - 00:34:34.943, Speaker A: I think for most people it's not worth farming blur because farming blur on season one, like I did, like, was worth a lot, but like, now I don't really care. Okay. It's like the amount of people farming it or like the amount of volume or like the TVL. Basically five x'ed from 30 million to like 150. And like, season two is a smaller airdrop than season one. So, you know, can. Can a retail participant, like, you know, reasonably, like, make money farming this, paying 0.5%
00:34:34.943 - 00:34:56.896, Speaker A: fees to, like, creators every single time they, like, sell? I don't really think so. So I think there are better things to farm right now. But everyone's doing this. Or maybe not everyone, but like the whales are doing this. So, you know, it's definitely interesting. So I just want to talk about the blur dilemma and this kind of relates to the token price of blur and why I'm a little bit worried. I'm not bearish.
00:34:56.896 - 00:35:20.370, Speaker A: Like, I actually think that blur is reasonably priced. I think the best comp for blur is not like, looks rare, but I think it's more DYDX. They're both very, like, low float, high fdv tokens infested by VC's and seed investors. But an amazing product. Okay. Like, and yeah, like, I mean, it's very similar, right? It's like 300,000,002.5 ftv.
00:35:20.370 - 00:35:41.250, Speaker A: 400 million. Like three $3 billion fdv. I think it's pretty similar. And obviously blur makes no money right now, but ideally in the future, governance can turn on the fee switch. So let's talk about the dilemma. So, of course, only 12% of the blur is circulating. And I mean, cool, right? Thank you for the money.
00:35:41.250 - 00:36:11.302, Speaker A: And now they're season two and they're gonna basically release 10% of the supply. So after season two, like, basically when season two ends, the circulating supply of blur is effectively gonna double. Okay. So if this circulating supply doubles and the market cap remains the same, then price has to go down like 40, 50%. Right. So that's one issue. And the blur team hasn't shared how long season two is going to be.
00:36:11.302 - 00:37:04.734, Speaker A: So the other dilemma is if season two is like six to nine months long, then, you know, like, is it really worth farming it, right? It's such a long time period and paying 0.5% creator fees, like, every time you like, I don't know if it's actually worth it. So maybe, you know, if they announce that it's gonna be like six, nine months, then maybe people will leave. But also if it's too short, if it's like, you know, if it ends in like sometime in April, then, then the market will price in the fact that, okay, like in April, the circulating supply is gonna double and that's gonna be bearish for the price. Of course, maybe it's gonna bring in new buyers, maybe they're gonna like, you know, incorporate like more features, you know, like more demand for the token. And, you know, ideally that happens, but, you know, it's really, really hard for the blur team to, you know, wiggle around this topic. And I think what they're doing is smart.
00:37:04.734 - 00:37:30.986, Speaker A: I think if I were in their shoes, what I would do is to just not give a date. I would just say, hey, season two is going to make you a bunch of money. And, yeah, like, you know, it's going to make everyone rich. And then, like, not just like, don't say anything. Literally don't say anything and only say something once. Like, you get a bunch of pushback. There's also like this topic of core contributors, launch partners and advisors.
00:37:30.986 - 00:38:05.608, Speaker A: Their tokens vest. I mean, they vest over like four to five years, but the first cliff is four months. So the circulating supply is going to only increase over time. So I don't know, I just feel like the token, I mean, I'm not bearish the tokenization, but I literally don't know what the risk reward of blur is because FTV 3 billion ish, right? At 2.5 billion. And I've heard recently that Opensea equity is trading at like three to $4 billion. I mean, don't quote me on that.
00:38:05.608 - 00:38:44.038, Speaker A: And equities different from like token FDV. Like, I'm not a huge fan of OpenSea. Right? Like, I'd much like, I'd much rather like blur do better than Opensea, to be honest. But is it reasonable for blur to be worth more than Opensea? Right? Like, Opensea still has like, significant network effects. I don't really think they're gonna do a token. I don't think their legal framework or legal structure allows them to do that. But, you know, mister Tangyan also talked about this too, where right now, if season two lasts for six months and distribute 300 million tokens, that's gonna be like roughly a million dollars worth of value at today's prices.
00:38:44.038 - 00:39:10.862, Speaker A: But also if, you know, if supply doubles, then maybe price should go down. So maybe it's closer to $600,000 worth of incentives a day. And the question people should ask is, is this sustainable? I don't quite know. It's really similar to what happened with luxware where they incentivize people to buy and sell on a list. They're doing a little bit better. Of course, blur, much better. The founder is very, very sharp, very, very strong.
00:39:10.862 - 00:39:44.878, Speaker A: I'd rather much bet on blur than looksrare. However, you know, I feel like the longer this takes, the successful blur is really like very, very dependent on the token price. And there's just like more supply coming into the markets starting in June or, you know, like whenever season two ends. And, you know, my gut feeling says it's not sustainable, but also, right, you're basically betting on a team to deliver. So that's the dilemma. If the, if season two is too short, it's bearish for price. If season two is too long, it might also be bearish for price.
00:39:44.878 - 00:40:16.952, Speaker A: And if it's too long, then, you know, the investor tokens start to unlock and, you know, maybe the sentiment gets sour until then. So very interesting to see. And to be honest, I really don't mind buying back blur later down the line, like maybe a higher price. And that's the thing with airdrops, right? It's like, yeah, you can sell and then you can like buy back later. There's like no shame in selling, right? Like they give you free tokens. Take it. Okay, so let's find and talk about NFT fi.
00:40:16.952 - 00:40:58.810, Speaker A: So I'm not sure like what people's sentiment is, but, you know, like, I mean, market has to become more efficient over time, right? It's like, it's Econ 101. Like, did Opensea really expect to charge 2.5% fees forever? Did creators really expect to like charge five to 10% royalties forever? I don't really think so. These things are not enforceable on chain. So, I mean, if a project want market share, then they're gonna, you know, go around that and I think that's good. I mean, I think opensea's like high fees is actually very destructive for the NFT ecosystem because there's a limited amount of NFT traders and collectors. So if these people have to pay 2.5%
00:40:58.810 - 00:41:50.228, Speaker A: every single time on top of royalties, then at some point, like people are going to like run out of money to buy nfts with and NFT supply is always going up. So I mean, that's one of the reasons. Like, you know, bear markets and hopefully, like the strong NFT projects can actually, you know, take over and recover. But like I mentioned, right, it's like, I think it's pretty much inevitable for NFTs to become more financialized and for defi, right, like Defi concepts for ERC twenty s to translate to ERc seven hundred and twenty one s and erc one thousand one hundred fifty five s. And I think NFTs or NFT five is one cycle behind defi. Yeah, okay, let's get that. So, yeah, I mean, like, literally three days after blur dropped the token, they literally like dropped their fees to zero and also basically said, okay, like we're gonna, you know, lower creator fees just so we can remain competitive.
00:41:50.228 - 00:42:44.564, Speaker A: And I think their writings on the wall, I think royalties are going to go down and I mean, it's not going to go to zero, but it's, you know, people are not going to want to pay, you know, fees, right, because people want to save on fees. And, you know, this was interpreted by market to be pretty panicky, pretty bullish blur, because literally, like, like, what the hell? Like Opensea, like took a stand, like block listing competitors created like protect creator royalties, but now they're like, okay, like, you know, we can't do it. I would expect Opensea to start doing some layoffs, to be honest. Magic Eden, which is an opensea fork on Polygon and Solana, they laid off 10% of the staff. And if Opensea's gonna make no money, then I'm sure that they've overhire during the bull market or something. But who knows? They raised a bunch of money. Maybe not, but am I really surprised by this? No, no one should be surprised by this.
00:42:44.564 - 00:43:18.534, Speaker A: And I still think that if you wanted to dabble in nfTs, this is like the best time to do so. Like, prices are down a lot. The price of ether is down a lot. So, you know, one ETH today is like less in dollar terms compared to like one eth twelve months ago. Or wait, yeah, yeah, like 1812 months ago. And literally all these marketplaces, right, are paying you tokens to buy NFts, right? List nfts, bid nfts. I've only, I mean, I'm pretty new to the NFT scene, as in like, you know, being an active participant.
00:43:18.534 - 00:43:55.300, Speaker A: I mean, I wouldn't even say that I'm that active, but I'm just trying to start creating an NFT portfolio and, yeah, I mean, if these marketplaces are going to give me free tokens, then I'm basically, you know, being compensated for the risk I take. I think with all the nfts I've purchased. I'm probably like break even, but they're all, but they're also super illiquid. So I'm not even sure if that says anything. Actually. No, I'm definitely up bunny because I flipped some little pudgies and rods. But, you know, anyways, like, you know, might as well try things, right? And you know, I think nfts kind of turn people off, right.
00:43:55.300 - 00:44:26.382, Speaker A: But you know, as a defi channel, as like a mostly defi channel. I just want to like leave you with this idea. If you just kind of apply defi concepts to nfts, I think it's going to make a lot more sense because at the end of the day it's like ERC 20s are like fungible tokens and nfts are non fungible tokens. Okay. I think it's inevitable for like, you know, the primitives built on DeFi to also be built for nfts. It's gonna take a longer time. It's gonna be more inefficient because nfts are so small.
00:44:26.382 - 00:44:54.752, Speaker A: I think it's inevitable. In 2021, I was farming dinosaur polygon, and then in 2023 I'm airdrop farming all these various NFT finance marketplace at creator lending amm, all these tokens. And I really encourage you to take a look at this sector. Not gonna lie. Like, there are very few projects that I think has, you know, has like fundamental value. There's like, there's like 20 different lending protocols. There's like some yield aggregators, but none of these have tokens.
00:44:54.752 - 00:45:35.244, Speaker A: So I feel like for me, like I bought like a pudgy penguin and I'm just gonna like use it as collateral, borrow against it for like a week on that one platform, a week on another platform, and just kind of like, just use all these things like all around. And hopefully in like 2024 or late 2023, they're gonna, you know, they're gonna thank me by giving me some governance rights. You know, they're gonna share some governance rights to me. Right. You know, hopefully sec does not protect me from these airdrops. So, yeah, I don't think using blur makes sense unless you really like the platform I'm actually starting to use magically, which is another NFT aggregator. I'll talk about that later, actually.
00:45:35.244 - 00:46:15.128, Speaker A: But it's really similar to DeFi summer and 2020 and the all to all one rotations where these projects are basically using their equity in their token to basically incentivize people to use their platform. Is it sustainable? Maybe not, but you know, if they do an airdrop, right, like you can just sell it on day one or day two, week one, week two, and chances are you might make a few hundred bucks, fewer thousand, a few thousand bucks. And if you're lucky, maybe like five, six figures. It's hard to imagine, but it's possible. It's definitely possible. Of course, I don't really expect like the Defi airdrops of 2020. Like, I know people that made like million dollars purely from airdrops only.
00:46:15.128 - 00:46:46.650, Speaker A: I think that era is overdevelop. And I think the airdrop farming in Defi, that side of the market is very saturated. People have made complex bots to do a bunch of activities and civil attack these airdrops. I think that on the NFT side there's less sibling and less buy. So I just think that there's more opportunities to beat them there. It's not like you have to buy hundreds of NFTs. I think you can just buy a few and just use it as collateral and hopefully know they thank you with a governance token.
00:46:46.650 - 00:47:29.526, Speaker A: And also, right, if you go to Bendao, which is the biggest, I guess, NFT money market. It's kind of funny. Like borrowers, eight borrowers are paying 27% APR in ether, but they're also being paid 30% in the bend token. Does this thing have value? Probably not. But hey, you know, if you're a whale, you can borrow against your NFT and like dump your bend into ether and like be paid to borrow. Does this remind you of something? Right? It's really similar to pneumatic days or I was being paid to borrow. I was being paid to borrow on avalanche, right? Like on Aave, right? Remember those good times? It's pretty similar, of course, right? Expect less upside, expect less liquidity.
00:47:29.526 - 00:48:04.682, Speaker A: But I think the concept is similar. And if you want to think about forward looking opportunities, the risk reward of like buying a few nfts and using these platforms is like so good, right? Very little downside, a lot of upside. And who knows, like maybe there's like a 3% chance you actually enjoy nfts and damn, like, you know, you found a new hobby, right? Or you like lose your life savings on cartoon jpegs. So, you know, Dyor, I guess. Yeah. So let's talk about some airdrops. Yeah.
00:48:04.682 - 00:48:32.940, Speaker A: So magically they said they're going to do this airdrop February of 2023. So I mean, I don't even know. I mean, I bought my pipes, right, the bottle pipes on here. So hopefully I get something maybe it's too late if you're watching this video. But who knows? Like maybe they delayed it. Yeah, you know, it's like magically is actually doing like a pretty decent amount of volume. So, like, might as well try, right? There's one, there's NFT perp.
00:48:32.940 - 00:49:13.998, Speaker A: It's gonna be an arbitrum, I think you can go to discord and request beta access. You can actually trade with real money and you can basically go along board apes go short, punch your penguins. You can short or long floor prices. I'm not quite sure if their model is scalable in terms of having this be a platform that trades billions a day or something, because there are like no chain link oracles for nfTs. And you kind of have to balance the long term shorts by like funding rates. I mean, it's, they're tackling a big problem. It's pretty exciting.
00:49:13.998 - 00:49:34.960, Speaker A: So I encourage people to give it a look. There's abacus. They have some notable investors. They're trying to do appraisal for NFTs and allow people to borrow against like LP positions. Interesting, right? Like, to be honest, I don't really understand what they're trying to do. But hey, like, I'll use the platform. Like, why not, right? I'll always.
00:49:34.960 - 00:49:55.530, Speaker A: The platform, like, you'll be able to borrow against your LP or collection and there's gonna be like some way for collectors or the creators to make their. I don't know. I honestly do not know. Right. But I'll use it. There's pro tech simplification layer and ecosystem partner for nfTs. I think they're also related to abacus to some extent.
00:49:55.530 - 00:50:15.070, Speaker A: Also doing something with creator own liquidity. I don't know. Okay. But I'll use it. I'll use it. Right. I mean, this is the, okay, so if you, if you haven't noticed, like, I have like no idea, like, if any of these have value, if any of these have used cases, but I'll use the platform because they don't have a token and they're probably gonna do an airdrop at some point in 2023.
00:50:15.070 - 00:50:49.490, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully in 2023. There's, this is backed. I consider this to be the maker Dao of NFTs where you can use NFTs collateral, borrow this thing called papper paper, paper meme, which is like pegged, soft pegged to the price of ether. I don't really understand what the point of this is, but I'll use it. I'll use it. Spice finance, NFT yield link or aggregated NFT lending liquidity. So there's 69 lending platforms for nfts, but I'll use it, I'll use it.
00:50:49.490 - 00:51:14.232, Speaker A: Collection XYZ. They're also doing some NfT amm thing. I think they have some other features. They're on testnet, might as well use the testnet, who knows? There's caviar amm, another NFT amm. I think they're actually on Mainnet. But the UI is very simplified and very new. But hey, I'll use it, right? I mean, by the way, like, I haven't used most of these.
00:51:14.232 - 00:51:45.278, Speaker A: I just have plans to use them. Okay. Because I don't have that many nfts to do all these at the same time. Manifold, very exciting. So this is the site that allows creators to launch like open editions, which is kind of like, I mean, I talked about before, but it's like very low cost nfts. It's like uncapped supply. So if I wanted to create some NFT collection, I can say, hey, like this NFT is worth $10 and in the next 24 hours anyone can mint as much as they want.
00:51:45.278 - 00:52:24.632, Speaker A: Okay, so that's kind of the concept and manifold, right? Like they don't have a token, but if they do, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be worth a lot. So that's cool. There's a platform called Zora. And for the next six days, you know, Coinbase launched, or they announced their intention to launch base, which is their L2. And you know, you can mint this NFT. Like almost 400,000 people minted it. You might as well mint it, right? It's like, I mean, I doubt that you'll get a token from this, but who knows? Like maybe if you mint this, you allow yourself for like a 1% chance for Coinbase to give you money.
00:52:24.632 - 00:52:51.930, Speaker A: If not, you use Xor the platform. And if they have a token, maybe you're eligible. Open sea. Right? When they basically cut marketplace fees to zero, they said, hey, we're going to explore ways to reward our most loyal users. And everyone was like, oh, token, I really doubt it. I think there's a saying that so people use their platform, but also like Vasa, who is the founder of Gem. So OpenSea acquired Gem and Gem is an aggregator.
00:52:51.930 - 00:53:16.560, Speaker A: And maybe they're going to do an airdrop, right? They said, don't want to leak too much alpha, but maybe if you start using gem v two, your wish might come true. Eyeballs emoji. And then he deleted the tweet. So maybe the legal team was like, don't say that. Right? Like, we're gonna get sued, but who knows? Like, I mean, I really doubt that we're gonna do token, but maybe. Right, like, so maybe use magically. Maybe use blur.
00:53:16.560 - 00:53:32.736, Speaker A: Maybe use gem, right? Like, it aggregates the best prices anyways, so, like, might as well. There's that. And there's a YouTube channel called NFT Finance podcast. They have less than 100 subscribers. This is criminal. They have really good content. I really encourage you to listen to most of these.
00:53:32.736 - 00:53:57.194, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, you can tell that I watched some of these, so, yeah, good channel. I think these people have good intentions. Okay, so last topic I want to talk about is tiki selling. So this is a nuanced topic, and I think most of you don't care, but I just want to be consistent with what I've said in the past. No. Yeah, because I don't like lying. So in terms of.
00:53:57.194 - 00:55:11.624, Speaker A: I mean, if you're new to the channel, maybe not basically, like seven, eight months ago, like, we were in the depths of the bear market, right? This was like post three ac, right? Basically, like, I was like, okay, I'm gonna start talking about some coins, but I don't want to, like, you know, if I'm gonna talk about a coin on my channel, given the size of my channel, like, it looks kind of scummy, right? If I buy something, make a video, sell it like a week later, right? Like, who the hell does that? So I was like, okay, like, in order to align incentives between you and I might, me and my audience, if I make a video on a coin, I'm not gonna sell, right? Or if I do sell, I'm gonna pre announce that I will sell at some point. So I made that because we're in a bear market and I didn't want to, like, you know, move markets and stuff. But, you know, as I mentioned at the very early stages of the video, you know, January, good month. February, also a good month or, you know, decent month. And I just wanted it. I just want to start being cautious. I also mentioned that I hold very little amounts of cash, and I also kind of, like, pigeonholed myself into this position where I'm like, okay, like, I bought.
00:55:11.624 - 00:55:26.200, Speaker A: I bought a bunch of coins. I hold so many of these coins, right? But, like, wait, I can't sell them. I mean, I'm sure. Yeah, like I said, I'm sure you don't care, but I'm just, like, saying that. Okay, like, seven, eight months ago, I said this. I haven't sold. I've only bought.
00:55:26.200 - 00:55:54.980, Speaker A: But now I have to draw the line, okay? Like, I have to protect myself in case I get wrecked. Okay? Like, I do not want to get wrecked. I've gotten wrecked enough times last year. So these, yeah, so GMx FXs, Sudo. Right. These three coins I've only, like, kept adding since this period. But, you know, starting, let's say, march 4, I think I just came up that because, like, five days from today, I think.
00:55:54.980 - 00:56:20.930, Speaker A: I think, yeah, I think. But, yeah, like, this doesn't mean I'm selling. Okay? I just, I'm just saying that, hey, like, starting from March 4, I can sell if I want to. And, like, realistically, like, I've held GMX for over a year. I've held fxs through all the stablecoin fud. I'm an active governance participant in sudo. So, like, I don't really see myself selling, like, you know, anytime soon, to be honest.
00:56:20.930 - 00:56:54.100, Speaker A: But, hey, like I said, I, I said I'll do this. So I'm doing it. I'm not gonna, like, dump it today or something, even though I'm not going to. I'll say, like, okay, like, five days. I think that's fairly reasonable because the problem with me right now is, like, I own a bunch of these coins and there's like, new tokens launching and I want to buy them, but, like, I already hold, like, or I barely hold cash. Like, I don't want to use my cash to buy these things. So maybe I can rotate my altcoin profits into this, but also, like, I can't sell or I said I'm not gonna sell.
00:56:54.100 - 00:57:33.874, Speaker A: So it's like, I'm kind of handcuffed here. So basically, you know, I'm not bearish these projects, I'm not bearish these tokens. But, you know, just let me rotate profits, let me sell into cash or ether or something. And also, like, if it's like some random, like, fud hat, like drops of that's really bad, then, you know, I want the ability to, like, rebalance or something. So that's that, right? That's it. Nothing that I think just give me some optionality. And I think, you know, starting from today, like, I'm probably not gonna do this anymore.
00:57:33.874 - 00:58:04.804, Speaker A: I'm probably not gonna say things like, oh, yeah, I'm not gonna sell this because, yeah, I mean, you know, holding the same coins for like seven, eight months, I mean, I don't mind, right. I'm up on all these coins, but like, you know, it's like I want more optionality and, you know, like I'm not putting or like I'm doing a disservice to myself, like financially and I guess flexibility wise. So there's that. Thank you guys watching. I think that's about it. Yeah. So hope you guys enjoyed.
