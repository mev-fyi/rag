00:00:00.560 - 00:00:08.610, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taki here. Welcome to episode eleven of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I have here with me Chow from Alliance Dao. How are you doing today?
00:00:09.390 - 00:00:12.942, Speaker B: Great to be here, Taeki. Really excited to talk to you.
00:00:13.126 - 00:00:18.558, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you don't need an intro, but do you mind, for our audience, just sharing how you got into crypto and what you do.
00:00:18.574 - 00:01:00.110, Speaker B: Now, I'm founder support for alliance founders. For the last three years, I spent almost all my time helping our founders to get to product market fit. Most of our founders are first time evergreen founders. And for me, the greatest feeling in the world is to believe in a founder before they even believe in themselves and help them and turn them into monsters. I felt like I found my life's work at alliance, and I just got a lot of energy from doing that. Before alliance, I was the family header product in Masari. And, I mean, everyone knows Masari is doing really well.
00:01:00.110 - 00:01:06.910, Speaker B: And before Massar, spent many years in tratfi, so I used to be a tratfi bro.
00:01:07.490 - 00:01:23.260, Speaker A: Nice, nice. You kind of sound like a parent there. You know, you're trying to take these young 20 year old kids and they lack the self confidence, but you're gonna, like, try to convince them into monsters. Is that kind of how you view it? Like, just trying to groom these people into just be killers?
00:01:23.420 - 00:01:43.640, Speaker B: In a way, yes. But I also. I actually learn more from them than they learn from me. So sometimes I feel like a parent, but other time, most of the time I feel like a student, and I get to see both success stories and failures about 50 to 100 times per year. So I learned a lot from them.
00:01:44.310 - 00:02:19.081, Speaker A: Yeah, I think growth mindset is very important to have in crypto. The space is changing constantly. There's new narratives all the time, new sectors. And I guess to demonstrate my growth mindset, I do want to ask for your advice, because this is going to be my second cycle. It seems like the bitcoin ETF, that's been good. Market spirits pretty high, but I don't want to be a mid curve. And then Satstar shared this hilarious tweet, and you kind of quoted tweeted it where second cycle, you have so much PTSD that you do dumb things like sell the news.
00:02:19.081 - 00:02:33.121, Speaker A: It's Preston. Speculation is bad. And then third cycle, you come full circle and finally appreciate bonk and dog with hats. Can you kind of explain your interpretation of this bell curve meme with first cycle, second cycle, third cycle?
00:02:33.265 - 00:03:04.126, Speaker B: Yeah. So first cycle, you know nothing, and you take a lot of risk. A lot of people take a lot of risk and they hit big until the bear market hits, they lose 70% to 80% of their investments. But that's still better. It's still better than being a no coiner. But the problem is, once you've lost 80% of your investments, you just get so much PTSD and then the second cycle comes in. What happens a lot is you just pay per hand too early.
00:03:04.126 - 00:04:00.300, Speaker B: So this ETF thing is actually a great example of it because a lot of people are like, sell the news, it's priced in, blah, blah, blah, by the way, I have no strong opinion on that. I don't actually know if it's sell the news or buy the news. I don't know if it's priced in or not. But I do think that we're still in the early innings of this bull cycle. And if you're going to sell the news off of this ETF thing, you might be able to capture maybe 20, 30% of the move. But then the upside is like three to five x on the majors and way more on the alts, right? So you're trying to, you know, catch a 20% move off of the 1010 x move, ten x upside if you're wrong. I mean, the, the downside is, is, is too big, right? So I just don't see why you would want to do that.
00:04:00.300 - 00:04:43.570, Speaker B: And that's what I mean by mid curving in the second cycle is paper heading too early. Now, the third cycle comes in. You've learned all your lessons from the past two cycles. And for me personally, this is my fourth cycle, probably, and this is the first time I really start to appreciate meme coins, like Bond can come with. And I, you know, a lot of people actually are skeptical about, like, I tweet about with quite a bit. I don't say you should buy with on Twitter, but I do tweet a lot about it. And sometimes people are angry that I'm, you know, that I talk positively about meme coins.
00:04:43.570 - 00:05:29.580, Speaker B: I suspect they're second cyclers, by the way. But. But once you're in your third cycle, you really start to realize that the price and the valuation and fdv of a lot of these tokens are really driven by memes. Bitcoin is the epitome of it. The meme behind bitcoin is digital gold. It has no revenue. Why should it command a trillion dollar fdv? And yeah, you're pulling up this tweet, but ETH is the same thing, right? The meme behind ETH is, I guess, a programmable launching a tech play.
00:05:29.580 - 00:06:03.410, Speaker B: Of course, ever since the last two upgrades, ethnow has a yield. So you can say, okay, ETH now maybe has a yield, has cash flow, blah, blah, blah. It's no longer a meme coin. But before that, for the first, like, six to seven years, ETH was also meme point. Same thing you can say about Seoul and Cardano and stocks. Everything is a meme for me in crypto, by the way. I'm not saying that's the right way to look at things, but I think it's a helpful perspective if you view things through that lens.
00:06:03.410 - 00:06:07.610, Speaker B: A lot of things, a lot of valuation, crypto will make sense to you.
00:06:10.000 - 00:06:48.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. I think with crypto, there's no value. I mean, you can try to do p ratios or, like, growth metrics, but no one really knows what the fuck they're doing. Right? Like, to be frank. Um, and at the end of the day, there's a limited amount of capital in, like, the trading community, and people just want to make money. So trading in crypto is kind of like trading attention, right? It's like, if you can kind of think ahead of like, okay, people care about this now, but what will people care about in, let's say, two months? And then you kind of position yourself for that. Um, and if you think that people will care about fast and cheap chains, then, yeah, like maybe Solana say, right, that's where people go.
00:06:48.380 - 00:07:04.720, Speaker A: And it's like, then, like, if people want beta to Solana, do they buy things like orca, you know, like Jito? I'm not sure. You know, like, the Defi eth chart is. Has been memed to death, right? Like Dejan Carton saying, make her eat to zero. Right? So it's like.
00:07:06.820 - 00:07:08.240, Speaker B: America is overdevelop.
00:07:08.310 - 00:07:44.564, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm part of the mid curve, right? I'm like a maker bull. So I'm just like, in the mid curve, but I'm very proud to be the mid curve. Right. I'm just like, you said it best, right? I was left curve initially, made a bunch of money, lost a bunch of money, and now I'm like, yeah, I'm a mid curve, but I'm trying to respect the mid curve. I represent 68% of the population, and there's some value in that, but I need to steer left or right in the future. And I love how you mentioned I'm going to go back to sharing my screen here, but Cardano is a meme for those who want to hurt themselves.
00:07:44.564 - 00:08:00.560, Speaker A: I mean, it's kind of a joke, but I feel like at the end of the day, people kind of get what they want from the markets, right? It's like if you're gambling on memes, you're just having fun, right? And if you make money, that's great. If you don't, then at least you get to laugh at, you know, does the dog still have a hat?
00:08:01.700 - 00:08:29.760, Speaker B: Cardano is actually a really interesting case study. I don't know much about what's going on there because I never see developers building on Cardano. But I saw a very interesting dataset recently, which is the average holding time of various tokens, the top ten tokens on Coinbase. And that data is public, by the way. You can log into Coinbase, go to the asset page and see what's the average holding time of that token. And guess what? Cardano is ranked number one.
00:08:30.140 - 00:08:30.780, Speaker A: Whoa.
00:08:30.900 - 00:08:44.572, Speaker B: 300 day holding time. Average holding time for Cardano. And number two is Solana. It's around 200. 250. And number three is bitcoin. And I was thinking to.
00:08:44.572 - 00:09:10.020, Speaker B: I was. When I saw this data, I was saying to myself, this is the most objective measure of whether or not a community or token is a cult, is a religion. And Cardano turns out to be the biggest cult in crypto. And that's why their token has, like, despite nothing happening on Cardano, at least from my perspective, the token is trading at, like, ridiculously high valuation.
00:09:10.800 - 00:09:33.600, Speaker A: Yeah. And obviously, I have, like, a YouTube channel, so I kind of have a good glimpse into the YouTube crypto community. And, like, the Twitter community and Cardano index. RP is huge on crypto YouTube. But people on CT don't, like, watch youtubers because they think they're, like, mostly scammers, which. Or grifters, like, you know, which I partially agree with, but. But little follow up with the holding period.
00:09:33.600 - 00:09:41.088, Speaker A: Like, does that take into. Is it because people aren't withdrawing cordano? Because they don't. There's, like, nothing to do. So it's just like, sitting in their wallets.
00:09:41.184 - 00:10:13.438, Speaker B: Like, that is a really good. Yeah, that's. That's a really good question. I don't know how exactly they calculate it, but what you mentioned just right, there is a possible reason why the data is skewed. Because if you own bitcoin, you can withdraw into your own hardware wallet, and people are pretty comfortable with it with a hardware wallet. But I'm not sure how much Cardano holders are educated when it comes to cold storage and doing stuff on chain. So.
00:10:13.438 - 00:10:15.370, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good point.
00:10:16.230 - 00:10:33.374, Speaker A: Yeah. I remember Cardano smart contracts were super hyped. And then there was Sunday swap, and I think they launched and it took, like, seven weeks. Sorry, seven days for your transactions to settle. I don't mean to bash on the Cordano community. Right. Like, you know, I have nothing against people.
00:10:33.374 - 00:10:48.750, Speaker A: Right. But it's just kind of funny how you set cordon. Those were people that want to hurt themselves. That's hilarious. That's really interesting, though. That's really interesting how. Because technically you can withdraw Solana and do stuff, but people, I guess people still like to hold Solana on Coinbase.
00:10:48.750 - 00:10:57.394, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. And I guess, like, these l one tokens, they're all cults in some way. And let me just pull up this other tweet.
00:10:57.522 - 00:11:27.800, Speaker B: By the way, the devil's advocate against Solana is that Solana, the Solana holding time is like 350. Well, guess what? The Solana bear market also lasted that long. Like, Solana was, like, flat below $20.25, let's say, for, like, almost a year. So, like, all the. All the bag holders didn't want to sell for 250 days. So that's the devil's advocate against that number for Solana.
00:11:28.700 - 00:11:34.282, Speaker A: Do you mean that there's a lot of, I guess, bag holder resistance of people that's trying to so, like, break.
00:11:34.306 - 00:11:40.386, Speaker B: Even, you know, like, oh, shit, my token is down 90%. Why would I sell now? Kind of sentiment.
00:11:40.578 - 00:11:57.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I've heard a lot. Like, I mean, whenever I talk to crypto people, people are like, oh, yeah, I'm going to wait to sell until I'm breakeven. I feel like that's a really bad mentality to have, because you should just evaluate your portfolio every single day as. It's. As if it's like a new position. What other types of.
00:11:58.066 - 00:12:25.868, Speaker B: In a way, yes. But. But the flip side is, if you're lucky to pick the right coin, let's say BTC from the early days, or eth from the early days, or Solana in the last. In this cycle, then the right thing to do is to backload it. Right, because the price will eventually come back. But if you're unlucky to pick the. Or unskilled to pick the wrong token, then, yeah, you shouldn't have back.
00:12:25.868 - 00:12:26.848, Speaker B: Backhauled.
00:12:27.024 - 00:12:47.496, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that's easier said than done, right? Like, how do you pick the right coins to bag hold versus, you know, like, just, you know, get out of. Get out there with a loss. I know he had this tweet around how everything is a religion, and that's really bullish. Like bitcoin now, either. Now, Solana, like, how do you kind of. Oh, and you also have kind of talked about the mid curve here, too.
00:12:47.496 - 00:13:04.040, Speaker A: But, like, how do you kind of identify religions before their consensus? Right? Because, of course, right now, everyone can say, oh, yeah, slana, strong community, et cetera, bonk with, et cetera. But, like, three months ago, that was really hard to identify. How do you spot these things before they happen?
00:13:09.260 - 00:13:57.936, Speaker B: In a way, it does require someone to be in my seat to see that, because I speak with the developers day in, day out of. So a year ago, when Solana, sort of, when everyone claimed Solana died because of FTX, I knew that was wrong, because I saw firsthand that the Solana developers, there were a handful, maybe a critical mass of 100 developers, Solana developers that were crazy about Solana. They were not leaving Solana. And this is something that you probably can't see on Twitter or on YouTube. So that's the sort of, quote unquote, insider information that I have. But I tweeted about it, so you can see that kind of information from me. So that's one thing you can.
00:13:57.936 - 00:14:33.830, Speaker B: You can. One piece of information, you can tell whether or not an ecosystem is a religion. But something else you can look at is, like, on Solana, you have people like Xerox Mertz single handedly taking on all the ETH maxis in every debate and ratioing every single one of them every single time, like. And Xerox Murdy. He's not a paid shill or anything. He's a developer in the Solana ecosystem himself. He's building a RPC for Solana.
00:14:33.830 - 00:15:17.400, Speaker B: And yet he loves Solana so much that he would spend so much time, day in, day out, to debate ETH Maxis. That is a sign of religion for me. And I see something similar with the tensor founders and the founders of Kamino, both of which are salon projects to a lesser extent, of course. But you see signs of this, and you see growing signs of this. BTC is basically taking this notion to the extreme right. By definition, all the BTC Maxis, they have nothing to do except for huddling and debating others on the Internet, by the way. They blocked.
00:15:17.400 - 00:15:22.068, Speaker B: I got blocked by all of them. In the last cycle. No, in the 2017 cycle.
00:15:22.164 - 00:15:23.000, Speaker A: That's bullish.
00:15:23.540 - 00:15:41.660, Speaker B: That's really bullish, because every time I try to have a reasonable argument with them, I just get blocked. So they lived it in their own bubble, and their bubble grows. So that's something. I can see this stuff on Twitter. It's public information.
00:15:42.640 - 00:16:19.642, Speaker A: Yeah. And even like, ansem too, right? Ansem is kind of like this main character, and he was just like Bobo Singh Solana. And then, you know, as soon as things start pumping, he's like, oh, like I told you guys. And it's like this tribalism starting all over again. Another element I want to add is in order for, I guess, ecosystem to form a strong community, like, you have to make the early believers rich, right? And I think that Jito Airdrop did a lot where I know, like, one of the analysts that worked for me, like, he made, like. I mean, I'm not going to say, yeah, he made like an insane amount. Like, he just, like, staked Solana across like six wallets.
00:16:19.642 - 00:16:45.940, Speaker A: He was like, what? He was in disbelief, you know? And now there's like, the Jupiter airdrop. People are speculating on the tensor airdrop parcel airdrop margin, Phi. There's so much things to look forward to that I think it's really hard to not be a pessimist on the Solana ecosystem. You have to make the early holders rich. And that's why I'm super bullish. The airdrop narrative of this cycle, it's the easiest way to bootstrap a community. What do you think about that?
00:16:46.100 - 00:17:26.166, Speaker B: When it comes to making early adopters rich? Solana is actually not the front runner for me, because Solana, at the end of the day, their earliest supporters were in fact, VC's and the big guys like FTX. The front runners for me is bitcoin and Ethereum. By definition, bitcoin was open to the public. Everyone could have bought bitcoin if they wanted to, and they made the BTC. Max is really, really rich. Ethereum, same thing. Back in 2014, there were 3000 wallets that participated in the.
00:17:26.166 - 00:17:56.040, Speaker B: In the presale of Ethereum. Everyone could have participated. And I'm actually not aware of any vc that did every vc mid curved on Ethereum back in 2014. And so Ethereum made the early individual retail buyers also very, very rich. That's why you have Ethereum and bitcoin as the two biggest religions in crypto. Solana, for me, is number three, by the way, interesting.
00:17:57.300 - 00:18:26.410, Speaker A: And I just wanted to share this other tweet that you posted here. So, like you mentioned earlier, you identified that other than bitcoin and ether, you've also identified Solana, arbitrary optimism, polygon, gaudmus as the seven magnificent ecosystems. Is this because you, just like you have all these applicants that you might want to invest in, and most of them are building on these ecosystems. Is that kind of how you determine which ecosystems might be a winner in the next cycle?
00:18:26.570 - 00:19:13.938, Speaker B: There's a quantitative aspect of it and there is a qualitative. By the way, this Mac seven could have easily been nine. I just like the word Mac seven because that's what the boomers say about the max seven stocks in the SMB 500. But if you scroll down to the bottom of this, of thread and you click on this data right here. Yeah, you can open the third one, the third screenshot. So you can see very easily from this, this is the startups applying to alliance over the last three years. And uh, Ethereum is, is by far number one plus Polygon, by the way.
00:19:13.938 - 00:19:18.950, Speaker B: Polygon. Polygon is another very interesting, uh, case study because everyone hates on Polygon now.
00:19:19.330 - 00:19:25.970, Speaker A: But yeah, it's, it's like the common thing to do on Twitter, right? It's like the popular thing to do. It's like, oh yeah, like polygon sucks. This is interesting.
00:19:26.090 - 00:20:02.190, Speaker B: Polygon has the second largest ecosystem of developers, at least, startup founders. Solana is number three. And Solana is making a v shaped recovery since. But if you look at the Solana part, it bottomed in h 220 22. Well, guess what? What else happened in h 220 22? FTX collapsed in h 220 22, but it's making a v shaped recovery now. So those are our top three. But then within ethereum you have arbitrum and optimism.
00:20:02.190 - 00:20:38.204, Speaker B: Both are doing really well. They're like number three and four. I would consider Bayes as part of optimism for now. You can argue that it's separate, but the reason why I didn't include Bayes in the original Max seven is because they're new. They launched maybe half a year ago, close to a year ago maybe. So they need to prove that they're Lindy. That's the only reason why I didn't put Bayes there, but I'm very bullish.
00:20:38.204 - 00:21:23.216, Speaker B: Bayes for the next cycle. Bitcoin is the one that will catch everyone off guard. I think bitcoin is actually growing and everyone in for me, the VC crowd and the west, these two crowds are underestimating bitcoin. But there is a growing number of developers building on bitcoin, thanks to ordinals, BRC twenties and other protocols like this, making bitcoin more interesting. And there's a growing a number of startups building bitcoin. Layer twos, that's another topic. Very interesting topic.
00:21:23.216 - 00:21:39.820, Speaker B: In its own bitcoin is going to catch and run off guard. I think it's really interesting. And then the last one is Cosmos. Cosmos. You don't see it. You don't really see it on this chart. And primarily that's because Cosmos developers are.
00:21:39.820 - 00:22:09.470, Speaker B: A lot of them are middle layer infrastructure projects that don't need an accelerator like us. They just raise a shit ton of money from VC's and they just go for it. That's why you don't see it here. But, you know, if you think about the recent projects that everyone is talking about, you know, say, Celestia, all these projects, they're built on the Cosmos SDK. So, yeah. So these are the Max seven.
00:22:10.770 - 00:22:34.824, Speaker A: Yeah. That's interesting. The bitcoin stuff is interesting. I've seen some videos on Twitter where there's these chinese grandmas trying to figure out how to mint VRC twenties. And I feel like this is one phenomenon that I notice on CT is that I think most of CT activity is amongst, I guess, white men, Americans and Europeans.
00:22:34.952 - 00:22:36.928, Speaker B: CT is very us centric.
00:22:37.064 - 00:22:50.034, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. They don't really know what's happening in other ecosystem, like, in Asia. Like, do you think this is like. I'm just curious, but, like, with Polygon, like, are these mostly, like, developers from India that's applying to you, or is.
00:22:50.042 - 00:23:11.340, Speaker B: There a. Polygon has a big community in India, but I don't think Polygon is. Is restricted to India. I think they're all over the world. I think Polygon just has a pretty bad pr right now. But I. I can almost guarantee the moment they change their ticker from matic to poll pol, the price will go up.
00:23:11.340 - 00:23:14.020, Speaker B: That's what the 70 iq in me thinks.
00:23:14.840 - 00:23:15.860, Speaker A: Really? Really?
00:23:17.080 - 00:23:43.410, Speaker B: Because the chart right now really sucks. If you look at it, it doesn't go up and the narrative sucks. But the rebrand, I bet it'll change everything because after rebrand the price chart on exchanges and on Tradingview, they'll restart the reboot from zero. So it'll print a nice chart, hopefully.
00:23:44.550 - 00:24:09.014, Speaker A: Yeah. When you were saying that, I kind of got reminded of this. Do you know beam? It's like this gaming subnet chain. It's like they were merit circle and the price was like 100 million val. And then they rebranded with a new token with smaller unit bias and ten x. Like, what. What is going on here? I guess, like, unibyce and this is like the mid curve take, right? It's like unibyce doesn't matter.
00:24:09.014 - 00:24:31.680, Speaker A: Like, you know, it's like. It's all about market cap. How the chart looks doesn't matter. But I guess, like, the 70 IQ says that, well, like, there's, like, no resistance. It's only up from here. And then if you're, like, 150 IQ, you're like, well, if that's how retail things, then I need to front run them. Is that kind of, like, the definition of.
00:24:31.680 - 00:24:42.560, Speaker A: Or maybe like, not the definition, but, like, the epitome of, like, the first cycle and the third cycler is like this? You know, you just, like, don't want to be in the mid curve. Right? Like, just don't do it.
00:24:42.680 - 00:25:02.670, Speaker B: Yeah. The unit bias 100% applies. And the price chart. Reprinting the price chart from scratch, that 100% applies. So, yeah, both are the 70 IQ phenomenon.
00:25:03.450 - 00:25:30.988, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Yeah. This is good to know because I'm sure that most of my viewers, because I started this channel in Q three of 2020, so I think most of my audience are second or third cyclers, maybe some first cyclers, but I think the most of them reside in this mid curve, like myself. Do you have any advice for them? I mean, we've already kind of talked about them, but if they want to take your knowledge and be in the right curve, like, what kind of.
00:25:31.084 - 00:25:59.138, Speaker B: I guess I personally mid curve a lot. Like, I actually tweeted about this most people, most of the time mid curve, and that includes myself. I just tried really hard to get out of it, and I think there are two ways to get out of it. One is a tweet about this. One is you read a. You read what people say on Twitter, and you don't want to read everyone's stuff. You want to read the people who are intelligent and controversial.
00:25:59.138 - 00:26:35.998, Speaker B: They're not afraid to piss off a lot of people, because on Twitter, there's a lot of politics. Oftentimes you can't say, there are certain things you cannot say, but you want to follow the people who make reasonable arguments about their views and are not afraid to be controversial and contrarian because you can learn a lot from them. You can learn the truth from them. What you don't want to do is read the stuff that just sounds. That's really abstract, incomprehensible. A lot of VC's do that, by the way. A lot of VC say things that sound okay.
00:26:35.998 - 00:26:54.300, Speaker B: That sounds smart. But if you think more critically about it, it doesn't make any sense. You don't want to listen to that. You don't want to read that stuff. That really is a fast food. It's fast food for me. It's junk food for my brain.
00:26:54.300 - 00:27:28.456, Speaker B: So that's one thing you can do. Listen to the people who are controversial and smart and concrete. They say concrete things. The other way is to risk enough of your own money to participate in those products, whether it's Jupyter or tensor or more recently say, or whatever. Just try other products and risk enough of your own money that if you lose, if you lose it, it's gonna hurt. Because the only way for you to learn a lesson is for you to get hurt. Or frantic.
00:27:28.456 - 00:28:02.520, Speaker B: Frantic is another example. I know this because I actually, I know a lot of people tried friendtech, but they only tried it for like five minutes, spent five minutes on it and started forming opinions on it. I think it's a really bad way. You want to use products for long enough of a time period to really develop insights, to understand the products intuitively. In other words, be a degenitive. Yeah, these are the two ways.
00:28:03.180 - 00:28:44.152, Speaker A: Yeah. I think you had a piece on this. Right? So it's like people should learn from the DJNs, because that's how you determine whether something will get usage or not. You have to be an early user. And I also think that the topic around politics, it kind of got me thinking of the whole ETH alignment discussion. It's like no one actually cares. What do you think about this whole ETH alignment thing or the politics around the ETH ecosystem? Because you also had this tweet around, I guess, my gift, or your gift to the ETH community around the lack of a strong narrative.
00:28:44.152 - 00:28:48.152, Speaker A: And we don't have to read through all this, but maybe we can focus on the very top part.
00:28:48.256 - 00:29:19.890, Speaker B: Yeah. I can summarize the original motivation, I think, for a very long time, and I call this the ETH marketing department. A lot of people don't like this, but it's really the ETH marketing department, quote, unquote, because obviously they don't have a real centralized department. It's more like the influencers of CT. Right. But for a very long time, I noticed that the youth marketing department sends messages that are too technocratic. Technocratic, too confusing, too ivory tower ish.
00:29:19.890 - 00:30:24.640, Speaker B: It's really painful. It's really painful for the intended audience. It's not that they don't have a. It's not that they have too many narratives, it's that they're not targeting the right audience and send them the right message. So if all you talk about on Twitter is technical jargons, like 48, 44, restaking, blah, blah, blah, all these things that the average person doesn't understand, then you're going to only appeal to the people who like this kind of stuff. And these are, let's say, protocol developers, philosophers, etcetera. That's fine, by the way, but what you really want to target as the Ethereum marketing department is the developers, or in this case, as I mentioned, the institutions.
00:30:24.640 - 00:31:17.660, Speaker B: So what I'm trying to say is, you want, if I were them, I would try to devise a clear message for each of these segments and not confuse them. So, specifically for this particular post, if the goal is to make price go up for the ETH token, then what they should be targeting is the institutions. And why is that? Because ETH has four very durable and unreplicable advantages right now. And these are number one, Ethereum is the most lengthy smart contract chain. Number two, it's the only smart contract chain that crossed the regulatory chasm. For example, they have a CME futures and related futures. ETF and SEc is comfortable with that.
00:31:17.660 - 00:32:06.290, Speaker B: And number three, they're aligned with Coinbase. And number four, they have a yield. Ever since the last two upgrades, all these four durable advantages lead to the same path, which is that Ethereum is the most institution friendly chain, and it's a set of vantages that no other smart contracts have. No other smart contract chains have, including Solana, avalanche, blah blah blah, blah, blah blah. And my point is, the Ethereum community really needs to focus on their own durable advantages, because come in May, the ETH ETF will get approved. But just because you get the ETF approved doesn't mean people will buy it. You want to give people a reason to buy it, and you want to give the institutions these four reasons to buy it.
00:32:08.870 - 00:32:24.210, Speaker A: So it says something there. I mean, first of all, maybe the bankless guys can be taking notes on that right now. But you mentioned that you think the ETF's going to be approved in May. What confidence interval would you give that? I know Larry Hink was talking about it on tv and stuff.
00:32:24.800 - 00:33:11.890, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the confidence is. Well, so let's start with the devil's advocate. Devil's advocate is that Garry Gensler is going to fight tooth and nail against it, but he'll need a really good reason to deny the ETF. But he doesn't have one because ETH is in the exact same situation as BTC when it comes to having a futures based ETF. And they went to the court for this. When it, when it comes to BTC, the court basically said that the SEC didn't have a good reason to deny the BTC ETF because the futures ETF existed. You cannot, you know, create double standards for the futures ETF.
00:33:11.890 - 00:33:41.920, Speaker B: And the spot ETF and Ethereum is in the same, um, spot as BTC on that front. And the second thing, which gives me really good, really high conviction, much higher than the first one, actually, is that Larry Fink is pumping it. And Larry Fink failed once in the last like 500 or something. 305. I can't remember the exact number. ETF applications. So you don't want to bet against that track record.
00:33:41.920 - 00:33:47.550, Speaker B: By the way, letter Fink is the marketing department for Ethereum as of today.
00:33:48.250 - 00:33:49.234, Speaker A: That's a good point. It's good.
00:33:49.242 - 00:33:50.030, Speaker B: I'm pumping.
00:33:51.130 - 00:34:08.000, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. No, like I. When you said that, I thought of. I thought of this ordart meme. It's, it's just like now, right now it's our Ponzi now, you know, like time to pump it. Give us all the fees. Is this your bull case for Ethan?
00:34:08.030 - 00:34:10.836, Speaker B: Yes, that is exactly. My bulk is for you.
00:34:10.948 - 00:34:32.160, Speaker A: And going back to this post here, I guess not buying into this EtH ETF narrative is like a mid curve. It's like, oh, it'll be sold on you. Someone wants to buy it. But then if you're a first cycler or a third cycler, you're like, well, Larry Fink's going to pump it.
00:34:32.460 - 00:34:40.199, Speaker B: Is that how their fang's going to pump it? And third cycler is. Yeah, Larry Fink has a great track record. You don't want to bet against it.
00:34:40.819 - 00:34:43.279, Speaker A: And second cycler is sell the news.
00:34:43.739 - 00:35:02.799, Speaker B: Sell the news or no way they're going to. I don't even know what argument they have now against the EFT ETF. I don't. I don't see it really sound argument. I'm not saying ETH has 100% likelihood of getting approved. There's always a likelihood of getting denial, but I just don't see a really good argument.
00:35:04.670 - 00:35:05.230, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
00:35:05.270 - 00:35:11.090, Speaker B: I think they're just sidelined. People who are bearish ethno are just sidelined.
00:35:11.550 - 00:35:14.450, Speaker A: You think there's this coping. You think BTC has bottomed?
00:35:16.750 - 00:35:35.780, Speaker B: I'm pretty confident it has bottomed. Two days ago, by the way, I was too early on this. I was like, eth BTC bottom like a month ago and it went down a little bit more. But in the grand scheme of things, I would just tour it a little bit.
00:35:36.680 - 00:35:43.780, Speaker A: Yeah. Look at this candle. That's a green dildo if I've ever seen one.
00:35:44.160 - 00:35:45.940, Speaker B: That's the God candle that people.
00:35:46.400 - 00:36:03.284, Speaker A: Yeah. This is crazy. 21%. I don't even remember the last time we had, I guess July of last year, we had like, 15% candle. But, yeah, this is, this is the market. Clearly telling the market that, hey, like, it's bullish, right? Like, sometimes you just have to listen to the markets.
00:36:03.412 - 00:36:05.040, Speaker B: The market showing its hands.
00:36:06.100 - 00:36:33.014, Speaker A: It's tipping its hands. It's always tipping its hands together. That's hilarious. We're, like, roughly 40 minutes in here. I do want to talk about some audience questions and some rapid card questions. So I guess just for some background, obviously, alliance you invest in earlier, like, early stage companies, right? Do you do any liquid market stuff, or is that more for your personal book?
00:36:33.182 - 00:36:35.730, Speaker B: Okay, I only do liquid from my personal money.
00:36:36.190 - 00:37:04.782, Speaker A: Okay, got it. Then I guess I'll answer, or, sorry, I'll ask you a question more from, like, the investment side with, like, a decent time horizon. But what are some common traits of successful investors? I mean, this is your fourth cycle. You're trying to get out of the mid curve. You're somewhat trapped in the mid curve, but you're trying to get out of all the successful people that you've encountered. What are some common traits that you see in them that you want to learn from?
00:37:04.966 - 00:37:31.446, Speaker B: I never thought about this deeply, because I feel like there's more differences between them than commonalities. I think to succeed in a market, different types of people, different strategies, different types of people can succeed. So, for example, on Twitter, we see a lot of these rotators that rotate every two months. They're short term traders. They understand the narrative. The short term narrative really, really well. They're DJ's.
00:37:31.446 - 00:38:07.238, Speaker B: They can succeed. And then you have the long term investors who can see where the market or the industry is going in two to five years. That takes a completely different skill in the liquid market. But then you also have the venture investors, and the ones that are successful tend to also have really strong network. Venture investing is more of a network based investing. So there's different strategies, and every one of them requires different skill sets. But I think, um, if I had to pick one thing, all of them are pretty good at math.
00:38:07.374 - 00:38:14.742, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So I guess it's like critical thinking, and I guess, like, more rational, you think?
00:38:14.926 - 00:39:25.880, Speaker B: Of course, yeah, rational and not sentiment. Not driven by their own sentiment. And by the way, this is something I want to touch on more because I tweeted about this, but I do think that most people on Twitter at least spend too much time doing short term trading, whether it's rotation or selling the news or looking at the RSI or the funding rates, it's really not a good game for most people. I would really strongly advise against that because you operate in a market that has ten x to go in, which you can probably find some 100 xs, potentially even 1000 xs, and why would you want to do this short term trading? You have probably very little edge in the short term stuff. So I'm going to sound like a broken record now, but I would try to be more like Warren Buffett than, let's say, Stanley Druckenmiller, at least in crypto. For most people, trying to become Warren Buffett is a better strategy for most.
00:39:27.180 - 00:40:11.244, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think one of the reasons for that is because a lot of Twitter posts are driven by, I guess, traders, because traders just have different thoughts all the time. And I guess they're incentivized to, I guess, get other people to buy after them or something. So they're always tweeting, right? They're tweeting ten times a day about a ticker, whereas investors, theyre just in their own lane, flourishing in a hot tub or something. Yeah, but I definitely agree. I guess advice is just because you see something on social media doesnt mean that its truth. Its kind of like how ETH maxis, I guess, their marketing department, theyre saying all these things, but it doesnt mean that its actually true.
00:40:11.244 - 00:40:20.960, Speaker A: In fact, theres things that they can improve on. Maybe they should be focusing on the institutional friendly chain as like what you said. Is that kind of how you think about it?
00:40:21.380 - 00:40:35.036, Speaker B: By the way, what I said, there is not the objective truth. It's just something that I think could work really well for ETH, and a lot of them disagree with me, and that's fine. But I think I'll be proving writing in three months.
00:40:35.228 - 00:40:36.100, Speaker A: All right. All right.
00:40:36.180 - 00:41:03.420, Speaker B: Because everyone's going to talk about the ETF. And anyway, that's a separate topic. Back to your original question. Yes, social media is just, Twitter is too noisy. I don't actually use Twitter as a source of insights and alpha, I use them more as a gauge of sentiment. If everyone is too bullish, maybe it's time to take some money off the table. If everyone's bearish.
00:41:03.420 - 00:41:34.070, Speaker B: By the way, I did this with Solana a year ago. Everyone was bearish Solana a year ago when FTS collapsed. I actually didn't, at that time, I didn't know that people were, I didn't associate FTX with Solana, to be honest. But I saw a lot of people talking about FTX was the reason why Solana would die. And I knew that that was false. So, yeah, I use Twitter as a sentiment gauge.
00:41:34.730 - 00:41:58.462, Speaker A: I see. Yeah, I also, I mean, I mid curve the Solana trade. I mean, I actually went to a hackathon for Solana and I met a bunch of teams and it was very vibrant. There was a bunch of people there. I was like, oh, this is pretty bullish. And then my mid curve inside me was like, well, the FTX liquidators are going to sell this much sol I can probably buy Solana in a couple months. And then that was my mentality.
00:41:58.462 - 00:41:59.930, Speaker A: And it was like four or five x.
00:42:00.470 - 00:42:54.070, Speaker B: This mentality, by the way, a lot of people have this mentality. And again, this ties back to my original point about being more like Warren Buffett than Stanley drug Miller, is that in the bear market, which probably is over, but for your next cycle in the bear market, you're going to have maybe a year, six months to a year to really accumulate at the bottom because the price action will be flat for six to twelve months. And you dont want to wait for the pickle bottom. Youre never going to catch it. What you want to do is probably DCA into a token that youre really bullish on for, lets say, six months and be done with it. Because when the market comes back, itll come back really violently. Which was the case for Solana.
00:42:55.620 - 00:43:24.798, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I guess it's DCA or things like that. It's not really sexy as a thing to talk about. People just want to talk about ten x, longing the bottom and making all this money. But it's too hard to do. It's just way too hard, you mentioned to have this Warren Buffett mentality of just finding things that you believe in and just believe right. Just be a left for left curve, right curve.
00:43:24.798 - 00:43:47.660, Speaker A: Just believe in something. What are some characteristics of, I guess, 100 x trades? Because obviously the industry is much bigger now. Maybe there's going to be diminishing gains, I guess, to the upside, but also diminishing returns to the downside. What type of sector should people be looking into if they really want to get those outsized gains in the liquid markets?
00:43:48.080 - 00:44:07.584, Speaker B: That's a really hard question. I don't think you can find 100 xs in the majors anymore. Majors are maybe ten x's from here. By majors I mean, let's say the top 20 to 30 tokens. So you have to look much beyond that. I don't try to. So personally, I don't try to catch 100 x's anymore because I've already caught 2000 x, 10,000.
00:44:07.584 - 00:44:42.850, Speaker B: I caught 1000 x and 110 thousand x. I'm not bad for the long tail of assets. I'm just trying to have some fun and not Yolo anymore. So I cannot give you good advice on this, unfortunately. The one, this not financial advice, but the one token I think I probably will get 100 x this cycle is with. That's the only token I'm paying attention to in the long tail. In the long tail of assets.
00:44:43.430 - 00:44:49.490, Speaker A: Interesting. I also remember you like Toshi, like the cat coin.
00:44:50.310 - 00:45:13.560, Speaker B: I really regret saying that in the past. I really regret it because I wasn't even high conviction. I just. I don't know why I said that, but on base, uh, bald could have been it. Bald is. Is the best meme on bass, so it's really unfortunate.
00:45:14.500 - 00:45:26.988, Speaker A: Yeah. It really had all the characteristics of a good coin. Right. Just Brian Armstrong, Jeremy Allaire. You know, it's like the tradfi chain. Like they're all bald. Like, you know, just buy bald.
00:45:27.164 - 00:45:27.612, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:27.676 - 00:45:49.860, Speaker A: But now, like the founder. Rugged. It is what it is. That's crypto. That's crypto, I guess. What are some, aside from mid curving and we talked about that, but what are some other common mistakes people make? Maybe some big misconceptions people have about the crypto markets that I guess are detrimental to people's success.
00:45:50.560 - 00:46:27.060, Speaker B: Can we pick a Persona because there's different Personas? For example, they make mistakes because they're so. They're still thinking their cash flow pe type of mentality. They're just going to make her everything. By the way, when institutions come into this space, there's no way they're going to outperform us in a PvP setting. No way there's going to make her for five years until their third cycle. For retail. Again, I think the biggest mistake is short term trading.
00:46:27.060 - 00:46:31.460, Speaker B: 95% retail have zero edge in short term trading.
00:46:32.400 - 00:47:06.784, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like those things where I think statistically 90% of traders lose, but if you get 100 traders in a room and you ask them if they're winning traders, they're all going to raise their hands. It's one of those things where you have to be self aware and, you know, if you have an edge, then you should push it. But most people's edge is just holding. Right and not being shaken out and then maybe make some contrarian bets here and there. How important do you think is contrarianism? Like Solana, for example, was good to write, but sometimes you want to be with the crowd. Sometimes you don't want to be with the crowd. Like, how do you think about it?
00:47:06.912 - 00:47:23.290, Speaker B: If you're a short term trader, you want to be with the crowd. If you're a long term investor, you want to go against the crowd of. Because the market typically operates this way. The short term, it's momentum driven. Long term is mean. Reverting in crypto, at least. Stocks is a different story.
00:47:23.290 - 00:48:04.818, Speaker B: Short term, you know, if everyone pumps something. But if you really want to be a short term trader, you just follow the big influencers like Hasaka and some these guys, they start pumping. Yeah, you just stop thinking this. Yolo, Yolo and Apim first, research later. If you. By the way, I'm not recommending this, but if you had to do this, you follow these guys. But long term investors just assimilate the, digest the information over a long period of time and at some point you'll be pretty good at it.
00:48:04.818 - 00:48:06.350, Speaker B: And you need to be contrarian.
00:48:07.130 - 00:48:40.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one type of contrarian bet, and this is what I also agree with you on, is like, RWAS pavement's cool, too. I think blackbird, I don't know if you've ever tried blackbird, but I think they could be like a good bet on essentially overtaking square. But the two biggest non consensus verticals you're excited for are these two. Can you kind of expand on why you think they're non consensus and what makes, like, what, why you think that they're going to be like such, I guess good trades or investments moving forward?
00:48:40.562 - 00:49:05.056, Speaker B: I think they're just boring. Like payment rws, they're just not sexy. Payment, like, it's not speculative, it's just pay with USDC for something. Right? It's so boring. RWAs, at least on a narrative point of view, it's getting some traction. But a lot of crypto purists are very much against rwas. They're like, you know, these are not true crypto innovation.
00:49:05.056 - 00:49:34.892, Speaker B: Want a true crypto native, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Right? Like, there's always skepticism against these two. So they're, they're not, they're not consensus, but the data is so compelling. So in 2022, I think $14 trillion worth of stable coins settled on chain. And that dwarfed PayPal, for example, by a factor of like six to seven. And that number also surpassed visa by a little bit in 2022. It's crazy.
00:49:34.892 - 00:50:17.104, Speaker B: It's crazy how, how much payment has, has gotten adopted. And one of the reasons why the still contrarian is because, again, CT is very much a US centric environment. And most people in the US don't appreciate how big of a deal stablecoins are for the global south. Stablecoin is a global south phenomenon and speculation is a first world problem. Everyone on CT talks about speculation that payment is really something that they don't talk about and really taking place in the global south.
00:50:17.262 - 00:50:58.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you can only speculate when your own currency is stable, right? So stablecoins provide a really strong use case for, I mean, for example, I think over half of USDT is on TRON. And I was actually looking at TRX and it's deflationary. TRX is more deflationary than ETH because part of the transaction fees gets burned. And I also read this Brevin Howard, their report on stablecoins. And, yeah, I mean, I think RWas is like a bet on, I guess, yield bearing dollars, as I, as I like to call it, just taking more market share from non yield bearing dollars. Like just USDC and tether. Of course, USDC, tether.
00:50:58.860 - 00:51:23.020, Speaker A: Like, you know, circle is going to IPO sometime soon, so I'm sure they're going to be worth a decent chunk. But, yeah, I still really like the RWA space. Last thing I want to ask as we wrap up here is, you know, if you could go back in time, let's say, to your first cycle or five, like, however long you want to go back in time. Do you have any advice you want to give your younger self?
00:51:23.720 - 00:51:59.790, Speaker B: You know, I just got really lucky. I think I've done. I play my cards really well, but if I could have done one thing was to quit tradfi much, much, much earlier and just go straight into crypto and build something. Ten years ago, I didn't have that high of a risk appetite. Ten years ago, I needed a fairly lucrative tri fi job in order to fund my crypto speculation. That worked out pretty well, but if I knew that crypto was going to get this big, I probably would have jumped a long time ago.
00:52:00.410 - 00:52:23.476, Speaker A: Yeah, I know a lot of people that tells me, hey, I want to go full time, but I'm kind of scared. Like what? Like what? What do you recommend? These people, right? Like, people that want to take the jump, but they're still kind of skittish. Is there anything that I guess they can tell themselves or, you know, point at and have that be a reason to just go deeper into the rabbit hole? Or does it just take time?
00:52:23.628 - 00:52:32.160, Speaker B: Takes time. And the fact that there. The fact that so many people are still skeptical about this industry tells me that it's still early.
00:52:32.640 - 00:52:49.580, Speaker A: Oh, bullish. Wag me. We're so early. Larry Fink. Larry Fink is still coming in. You know, it's, it's, he's going to make it his Ponzi. That's so bullish.
