00:00:00.320 - 00:00:35.420, Speaker A: What is up guys? Tyke here. And in this video I want to discuss how to be a liquidity provider on Sushiswap with only $500 using the Matic ecosystem. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. None of this is financial advice, so let's get started. So this will be the overview of the video. How do amms and decentralized exchanges work? What does it mean to be an LP, a liquidity provider? And lastly, what will be like, what is impermanence loss? A complicated topic and I'm sure many of you have questions. And then I'll wrap up the video with a quick tutorial on how to be a stablecoin liquidity provider on Sushiswap.
00:00:35.420 - 00:01:50.670, Speaker A: Alright, so how do amms and decentralized exchanges work? So the biggest decentralized exchange that we all know and love is uniswap, right, where you can essentially take one asset and swap it for a different asset. But how does this work on the back end? An analogy I like to use is thinking of these liquidity pools as fishbowls, right? And these fishbowls are LP pools, where there's a 50 50 ratio of two assets equal dollar amounts, right? So there's the same amount of ETh and the same amount of USDC. And if you want to buy ETH with USDC, you essentially throw USDC into the pool and pull out ETh on the other side. And this is only possible because there are liquidity providers all around the world providing liquidity for this particular pool. In this example, this is a little outdated screenshot, but at the Tate, at the date when I took the screenshot, there was $250 million worth of liquidity in this pool, right? But if you think about it, like, who is providing the liquidity and what are their incentives? Well, the incentive is that liquidity providers earn a 0.3% fee on all trades provided on this particular liquidity pool. So as you can see here, in the past 24 hours, this pool has generated over $200,000 in fees.
00:01:50.670 - 00:02:21.668, Speaker A: So let's say I'm a whale and I have $25 million worth of liquidity that I provide into this particular pool. Well, because the total liquidity is 250 million, I own roughly 10% of the pool. So that means I'm entitled to 10% of the fees. So if I had $25 million and I provided liquidity, then I would earn $21,000 of fees in the last 24 hours. Right? So that's how that's kind of how it works. But it sounds like free money. But are there any downsides? Right? Yes, there's always downside.
00:02:21.668 - 00:02:56.600, Speaker A: There's no such thing as a free lunch. The downside is that this, there's this thing called impermanence loss. And this is the definition of impermanence loss, where when you provide liquidity, you underperform in dollar amounts to just holding the token. But here's an example to, like, the definition itself is kind of hard to get your mind across. So here's an example of how this actually works. So let's say, you know, in the same USDC ETH pool, and let's say the price of ETH is at $1,000 and the price of USD USDC is a dollar, obviously. And I want to be a liquidity provider, and so I will.
00:02:56.600 - 00:03:43.892, Speaker A: I need to provide an equal amount of two assets, right? So one ETH and $1,000 of USDC. To simplify things, let's say after I provide liquidity, there's ten ETH and 10,000 USDC into this pool, meaning I'm entitled to 10% of the fees because I own 10% of the pool. Right, but let's say ETH moons, right? Goes up four x. So now ETH is trading at $4,000. In that case, ten ETH is now more, is now worth more than 10,000 USDC. Right? And also remember that there has to be an equal amount of two assets on both sides. And now that ETH has mooned the pool has to sell some ETH and buy more USDC and meet in the middle, where there's an equilibrium where there's a 50 50 ratio of both assets in this case.
00:03:43.892 - 00:04:25.120, Speaker A: So, yeah, it has to rebalance to less ETH and more USDC. And in this case, the ratio has to be equal. So it's going to be five ETH and 20,000 USD USDC into the liquidity pool, right? And so, you know, you hold ETH, you're happy. But if you think about it, like, when you pull out your 10%, right, like, because you're entitled to 10% of the fees and you own 10% of the pool, I'm only going to pull out 0.5 ETH and 2000 USDC, right? So I'm gonna pull out less ETh. Right, and more USDC. So with liquidity pools, you'll always own more assets that underperform, because you're gonna sell the asset that overperformed and then meet in the equilibrium.
00:04:25.120 - 00:05:17.950, Speaker A: Okay? So if you do the math, if I just held one ETH and a thousand USCC, and I did not provide, like provide liquidity, then I would have $5,000. But because I provide liquidity, I now only have $4,000, right? Because half an ETH and 2000 USDC. And obviously, like, in whatever time period this was, like, I would also earn 0.3% of all transaction fees, right? So hopefully within that time period, like, I earned more than $1,000 in fees to make up for this impermanence loss. But this is how important, this is how impermanence loss works, right? If I just held, I would have five k, but now I only have 4k. So this is a 20% impermanence loss. And this is like a quick diagram of like, how much impermanence loss you would incur depending on how much, how much, like, how much price movement one asset makes relative to the other asset.
00:05:17.950 - 00:05:57.238, Speaker A: Okay, so to wrap it up, to wrap this up, you know, pairing two different assets, right, pairing two assets that move differently in terms of price will always cause some form of impermanence loss. And the goal is that the fees will make up for it. And also, like, if you pair two of the same assets, right? So USDC and USDT, right, two stable coins, you would essentially have zero impermanence loss because there's literally no price movement. So you would just get all the fees that a particular pair will generate. And yeah, if you're exposed to impermanence loss, you hope that the fees and the rewards will make up for it. If not, then you just lose money out. Right? Okay.
00:05:57.238 - 00:06:40.466, Speaker A: That being said, to simplify things, I'm just going to do a quick tutorial on how to earn 25% yield on sushiswap by just being an LP for the USDC indict pool with only $500. So let's get into it. Okay, so now I'm going to assume that you have funds bridged over to the matic ecosystem. If you don't know how to do that, there's many resources out there and I'm not going to waste your time on how to bridge assets to polygon in this video. So let's get into how to be an LPD. So as you can see, I have 500 USDC and I want to provide liquidity on the USDC Dai pool on Sushiswap. As you can see right now, this pool is giving me around 27% in APY, right? So that's yield I'm generating on my dollars.
00:06:40.466 - 00:07:14.724, Speaker A: And so I click on this and I go to add liquidity. And like I mentioned, I have 500 USDC but no Dai. So I need to essentially take half of that and like buy Dai with it. So you can go to quick swap, you can go to sushi, but I can just essentially take USDC and swap it for DAi. So I need to approve this transaction, essentially giving the smart contract approval to spend my USDC tokens. Right? And as you can see, like, it's not like a one direct to one to one exchange rate. There's like a tiny, tiny discrepancy.
00:07:14.724 - 00:07:40.632, Speaker A: But this is natural for any us, any like stablecoin swap, there's gonna be a little bit of slippage. And it's because like USD is like 1.00, $0.01 and value might be like 0.999, $0.05. So there's always a difference. But you know, I'm just gonna make the swap here, right? And matic is great because these transactions are essentially free.
00:07:40.632 - 00:08:19.412, Speaker A: I don't know if you see my matic balance, but my matic balance is 0.001. And like, I think I can do up to a thousand transactions doing it. And if you don't have any matic in your wallet, what you can do is you can go to this website called Matic supply where you can essentially, it's like a faucet. You can up to three times a day, you can earn zero, zero, one matic, which can let you do roughly 100 basic transactions. So it's really appealing for retail clubs like me that can't afford $50 transaction fees on Ethereum. So let's see if that went through. Okay, so now I have 250 USDC and this much dai.
00:08:19.412 - 00:08:41.856, Speaker A: So now I can go to USDC. I'm sorry. I can go to Sushiswap and provide liquidity. Okay, so it's just up, it's updated. So yeah, I can provide this much die. It's not like super equal, but it's how it works. So I mean, now I have to give the smart contract permission to spend my USDC and then I have to spend, give the smart contract permission to spend my Dai.
00:08:41.856 - 00:09:05.008, Speaker A: And then after that I can provide liquidity. So let me just skip to that portion of the video. All right, so now I've given permission for the smart contract to spend both my USDC and DAi. Now all I have to do is to confirm adding liquidity. So I'm just gonna confirm this. And all this. All this takes Matic, right, the Matic token to essentially run these smart contracts.
00:09:05.008 - 00:09:48.606, Speaker A: But because Matic is like one of the best scaling solutions out there for Ethereum, you know, this is really, really easy. Okay, so I added to, I think I already provided liquidity, right? So let's go into the yield tab again and see whether I can submit my LP pools. Okay, so to earn a yield, right? So already provide liquidity. So I'm entitled to all the swap fees that associate swap generates. But I need to essentially stake my LP tokens, right? So that these LP tokens are like, it's like proof that I'm providing providing liquidity. So I'm just gonna approve these smart contracts. Again, I have to provide all, I have to like sign all these transactions.
00:09:48.606 - 00:10:47.318, Speaker A: But thankfully matic is really, really cheap to use, so let's wait for that. All right. But essentially after this, after I approve it, I can add liquidity and then I'm entitled to the 27% annualized in fees. And the reason these yields are so high is because Sushiswap and Polygon have this partnership where there's liquidity rewards, where they're essentially giving away Sushi and matic tokens for people to use the ecosystem, right? And these, like with Aave and all these applications on Polygon, there are all these liquidity mining incentives. So they're essentially paying you to use the platform. Okay, so, okay, so now that I approved it, I can just stake my LP tokens, right? And after I've done so, I earn 27%, right? And it's going to pay me in. So first it'll pay me to swap fees in USDC and Dai, right? So I'll be earning dollars just being a market maker.
00:10:47.318 - 00:11:28.508, Speaker A: And on top of that, I'm earning sushi and matic rewards. So this is like a good way. Like if you're bullish this tree, if you're bullish matic and you don't want to take on the risk of just like using your own money to buy these things, you can just take a very, very low risk lp pool with zero risk in permanence loss in the stablecoin pool, right? USDCDAI. And every day, every day I'll be earning sushi and matic. So as you can see, I'm already earning this much. I mean, this is like nothing, right? But I think about it like over many days, over many weeks, if you're working a full time job and you want to generate yield on your dollars, you're bullish crypto. You like crypto, but you don't really want to be like, you know, all in crypto.
00:11:28.508 - 00:12:27.850, Speaker A: Well, maybe you can allocate 20% of your portfolio into stablecoins and form sushi and matic with it by just being an LP. So hopefully this video was useful. Let me know in the comments what you thought of this and what other tutorials you might want me to do. I guess if you're like a tiny account like with $500 you really cannot use ethereum just because the transaction fees are like $50 and you saw how many smart contract approvals like signings and approvals that I did like if you have $500 all your money is going to be gone just by approving these smart contracts. But with matic because the transaction fees are so cheap and because you can get earn free matic through this faucet it really makes defi more fun and I guess more I guess what's the word? I forget the word but it makes defi usable again. So that being said, thank you guys for watching. Have a nice day and see you out there farming.
