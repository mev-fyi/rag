00:00:01.600 - 00:00:25.479, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here and welcome to Farms of the Week where I'll be going over the farms I'm currently in as well as the farms I'm watching. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Alright, so what a beautiful Monday it's been. We got, you know, all of our assets pushing all time highs. We got Luna Avalanche, Ether, Bitcoin, Bitcoin almost at all time highs. And as long as you're not buying scams, you know your portfolio should be pretty, should be looking pretty good.
00:00:25.479 - 00:01:01.177, Speaker A: I do want to get into the habits of selling on the way up. So I did take some profits on some of my altcoin positions. I do expect the market to go higher. But if I can earn 20, 30, 40% on stable coins, I really don't feel bad about taking some positions off because back in May, I mean let me know if you're in this period. But this is a very painful period, right? Because the markets looked really, really good. But then bitcoin rugged us and essentially when bitcoin rugs, everything else rugs harder. And back in May 2022, you know like I had to go outside to my farm, you know, get some air, you know, like take in some sun.
00:01:01.177 - 00:01:05.065, Speaker A: And I felt like I had to, you know, really farm my crops because I was really down bad.
00:01:05.105 - 00:01:05.401, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:05.473 - 00:01:26.461, Speaker A: And behind the smile was a lot of pain. So I do not want to go back there again. So that being said, let's kind of go over the topics I want, I want to go over in this video which is bitcoin and Ether strategies. Especially as we get later on to the year I want to discuss the underperformance of Joe relative to the price of Avax. Right. And no also discuss some avalanche farms as well as the Luna ecosystem.
00:01:26.493 - 00:01:26.661, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:26.693 - 00:01:53.769, Speaker A: Because that's what I'm super bullish on. So not financial or tax advice because I do talk about taxes. If you don't care to listen to like tax discussions then feel free to skip along to the next timestamp. Right. Anyways, essentially like when you there are tax implications like right. In crypto and you know, I don't know about you but I pay my taxes and you know if you take profits in Q4, those profits, right. Those capital gains has to be paid April of next year.
00:01:53.769 - 00:02:27.955, Speaker A: So if you delay taking profits until 2022, you can delay those tax payments for another 12 months. And in defi and in crypto you can earn 20, 30, 40% on stable coins really, really easily. So there's a lot of like, there's a lot of like, I guess, hidden expected value in trying to delay capital gains as much as possible. And I'm sure a lot of like for larger institutions are using the same strategies. So personally, for the last two months of the year, I'm going to try to minimize the amount of taxable events. So the way I do that is to focus on accumulating assets that I don't plan on selling for the rest of the year.
00:02:27.995 - 00:02:28.219, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:28.267 - 00:02:55.571, Speaker A: Like mid to longer term outlook assets. I'll also prioritize collateralizable assets because when you borrow against your assets, you don't really, you don't realize capital gains on that collateral. This is kind of what like rich people do where they just like borrow against their assets. And through DeFi, through money markets, you can do the same. And we're in the era of incentivized liquidity everywhere, right through money markets. So let's take advantage of it while it lasts. So for example, like let's say you have some bitcoin and you see a new form that you want to enter, but you don't want to sell your bitcoin.
00:02:55.571 - 00:03:35.483, Speaker A: You can use it as collateral, borrow against it, and then farm with that, right? This is a kind of an old screenshot, so it's not updated. So I think right now, thorough AAVE, you might have to pay like a 2% interest rate to borrow stablecoins. But if you're earning 25, 30, 40% on those stablecoins, then you know it's good debt, right? It's good debt. Because right now I think you can earn like roughly 25% on curb, on Avalanche. And like debt is nothing to be scared of, right? I feel like, you know, like when you, when you go to college, like debt is bad, right? Like, don't take on debt. Minimize the amount of debt as possible, as much as possible. But in crypto, like if you're paying 2% interest and earning 30% interest, then like that's not bad debt, right? That's good debt.
00:03:35.483 - 00:04:29.393, Speaker A: So not financial advice, but that's kind of how I think, think about things and how defi has changed my mindset about Deb in the past couple of months. So that being said, that's kind of what I'm doing with my bitcoin and ether, right? I'm holding a bunch of rap bitcoin ether. And when I bridge to other ecosystems, you know, I don't sell anything. I Just like bridge my ether to new ecosystems so I can just like borrow against my ether and that way it also works too. But let's kind of talk about the underperformance of Joe because this kind of surprised me, right? Because I expected Joe to do much better when Avalanche is going to price discovery. I made this video back in September 17th, right? So almost six weeks ago where I essentially gave an argument of why I'm gigalong Avax but hold no Joe or yak, right? Back then Joe and yak were like the hottest things out there. And I guess I made it more of a contrarian call or contrarian video.
00:04:29.393 - 00:05:08.745, Speaker A: I got some like, I guess dislikes, but you know, just sharing my opinion. And that wasn't really a bearish Joe or Joe or Yak video. In fact, I like them as the blue chips in the Avalanche ecosystem. However, this is more about risk management, right? And I'll focus on Joe in this particular video because I think a lot of people are really, really bullish Joe. And like my channel, I focus more on the process instead of the results, right? I play poker, right? Like you don't have to worry about the results. As long as you're making good decisions, you can expect to earn money over time. Similarly, I think that way, right? Like I might underperform like the apes that like get like that go super hard into altcoins and you hear those success stories, but you also don't hear about like the people that like lost it all.
00:05:08.745 - 00:05:55.815, Speaker A: So even though I might underperform people, that's like aping into like volatile altcoins, I think my strategy, my system has outperformed the majority of markets and that focuses on the process, not the results, right? Just because I make this video doesn't mean that Joe is going to go down, right? Joe might go to $10. I have no idea. However, you have to look at the data to make more informed decisions. If you want to make it in crypto, right? You can't just buy things and just expect it to go up. Sometimes it's like that in crypto, right? It's like totally easy mode. But you know, it's not going to be that way forever, right? I'm not claiming anything, just sharing data. So when I first made this video six weeks ago, I guess I compared the Avalanche ecosystem with that of the MATIC ecosystem, right? Because when I guess how my YouTube blew up back in April and May was because I was like, you know, I was early in thematic.
00:05:55.815 - 00:06:51.049, Speaker A: I play that ecosystem pretty well. And you know, I made some pretty good, pretty good decision making. Yeah. So Quick Swap was the number one decentralized exchange on the MATIC ecosystem. And the one thing I noticed, right, I was living in this moment and when like I bought Quick swap at like 3x and I was like super euphoric and then it stumped immediately after, right? And it could never get back, its all time high. And this was interesting because fundamentally Quick Swap was really, really strong back then, right? Now of course you might not think that way, but back then, like Quick Swap has super strong fundamentals, right? Matic was popping like the transaction volume was like at all time highs, it was earning lots of fees, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And I guess like the price of Quick Swap reacted really differently to the price of Matic, which I can kind of compare to this situation where you know, maybe the Gas token, we can make some comparisons there, right? Matic and Avax and then the number one Dex token, Joe and Quick, we can make some relative comparison there.
00:06:51.049 - 00:07:24.511, Speaker A: And on April 30th the price of Matic was at 82 cents, right? Before going to almost $3 in like late May or something, right? In May 18th it peaked at 245. I think actually it peaked around $2.70. I think this only takes into account like daily closes. Whereas the price of Quick Swap, it actually peaked roughly three weeks before the price of Matic did. Which is really interesting, right? Like you would expect everything to peak together, right? Like go up together, peak together and whatnot. But it was different. Like Quick Swap peaked three weeks before Matic did.
00:07:24.511 - 00:08:19.581, Speaker A: So how I interpret that data, right, was that at some point people are just going to start dumping like farm tokens for the native gas token as a flight to safety, right? Avalanche is a much safer investment than Joe, right? Just because it's a higher market cap. There's like, it's listed on more exchanges, there's more demand for it, right? So maybe the, the lessons we learned in the Polygon ecosystem we can apply it to here. And this video got a lot of hate back then, right? But no, I was just trying to like share my research. Like do I expect Joe to outperform? Yes. But what if history does repeat and Avax leaves everything else in the dust, right? What if no history does repeat and like Joe tops before Avax and then you know, people holding Joe are in Max Payne because Joe doesn't really do anything. Well, Avalanche goes past all time highs and just like goes into the like triple figures and whatnot. And you know, like, I'm not saying this is going to happen, right? I'm not saying there's 100% chance of happening.
00:08:19.581 - 00:08:45.329, Speaker A: But you have to understand that there is a chance of this happening, right? I mean, we're seeing it play out right now, but there's a chance of this continuing to play out in the future. Maybe there's a 10% chance, 20% chance, 30% chance, 50% chance. No one knows. Nobody knows. However, you have to do some mental models on your head if you are super long Joe of like, okay, like there is a possibility that Avalanche could just go up and Joe doesn't do anything. Like, am I okay with that scenario?
00:08:45.417 - 00:08:45.905, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:46.025 - 00:09:09.275, Speaker A: Because, you know, back then I did not want the Max Payne scenario to occur where like, I just like go all in Joe and the Avalanche goes up when Joe doesn't do anything. Right, right. Because the word the worst pain is like, you're right on your thesis of like being bullish to Avalanche ecosystem, but you're allocated incorrectly where you just like don't get to capture that upside. And I know what you're gonna say. Like you're comparing Joe to Quick Swap. How dare you? You don't know what you're talking about.
00:09:09.315 - 00:09:09.779, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:09.907 - 00:09:18.059, Speaker A: And I agree. I mean, I am way more bullish Joe than I am on Quick Swap. It's stronger fundamentally, it's a better product, etc. Right, I get that, but I'm just sharing, sharing data.
00:09:18.107 - 00:09:18.603, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:18.739 - 00:09:43.821, Speaker A: Especially because Joe, yes, you can stake X Joe and earn decent yield on it, but you can't really use it as collateral, right? Sure, you can use it on sir, there's like a cauldron Abracadabra, but it's often full. And Banker Joe with XJO probably isn't launching anytime soon, given X Sushi had problems with like Cream right there. There were some exploits there. And because Banker Joe is a, is a pork of cream, they might feel less comfortable, you know, releasing X Joe as collateral.
00:09:43.853 - 00:09:44.021, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:44.053 - 00:09:51.325, Speaker A: Just for safety reasons, which I do respect. Right. So for that reason, I feel like Avalanche offers more utility than Joe.
00:09:51.365 - 00:09:51.945, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:52.525 - 00:09:55.445, Speaker A: And for example, you can earn 50% on Avalanche.
00:09:55.485 - 00:09:55.637, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:55.661 - 00:10:07.165, Speaker A: On AAVE, and borrow against it. So on AAVE, if you go here, you can just take your Avalanche, put it as collateral on AAVE, earn 15% and you know, borrow stablecoins against it.
00:10:07.205 - 00:10:07.429, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:07.477 - 00:10:32.853, Speaker A: And if you borrow Tether, you're getting a free loan. And if you're borrowing USDC or die, you're essentially paying 1% interest rate to take on that loan. Right. And if you're putting it on the curve, right? And you're earning, let's say 20, 27%. I mean, why not? Right? It's a pretty good loan. So I made that video September 17th, which when the price of Avax was $69 and now it's roughly $90. And then price of Joe, September 17th.
00:10:32.853 - 00:10:36.581, Speaker A: Right. Essentially the same, same price as is now.
00:10:36.613 - 00:10:36.805, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:36.845 - 00:11:02.361, Speaker A: So, you know, just sharing data. Right. Maybe this isn't what you want to hear, but maybe it's something that you need to hear. And maybe if you're too exposed to Joe, maybe like it'll help you maybe derisk or, you know, rotate something to Avalanche. I'm not saying that you should sell all your Joe, Right. I'm not saying that Joe is not going to go up, but, you know, just take that data for what you will. Okay, so let's kind of go over some, some more exciting farms on Avalanche, right? Because there are a bunch.
00:11:02.361 - 00:11:35.519, Speaker A: And I guess Crypto Fish, the founder of Trader Joe, mentioned that, you know, I guess, I guess projects and developers need roughly three months to develop, right? So avalanche rush was announced August 16, right. Or like roughly mid August. So the new Avalanche ecosystem plays. Right. The new projects should roughly launch maybe mid to late November, maybe early December. And we're kind of seeing that play out, which is a bullish catalyst, right? Because prior to these new projects, the only exciting things on Avalanche was like, like Wonderland and Trader Joe. Right, sure.
00:11:35.519 - 00:11:53.841, Speaker A: Like the AAVE curve. Those are great, right? You need them to build out an ecosystem. But they weren't really exciting and they weren't really enough for me to incentivize. Enough to incentivize me bridging back to the Avalanche ecosystem. So first thing I want to go over is Snowbank. This is an Olympus style fork. I'm not in this one.
00:11:53.841 - 00:12:12.785, Speaker A: I'm not saying that you should be in this one. Right. I just want to briefly just touch on this because this thing launched today and it's already at like a 300 million market cap. Actually, let me refresh this. It might be a lot different. Okay, hold on. Need to do this.
00:12:12.785 - 00:12:26.365, Speaker A: And it kind of just goes over like the. Yeah, it kind of goes over like the risk tolerance of people in the Avalanche ecosystem. And it kind of reminds me of what happened, I guess, in the Matic ecosystem.
00:12:26.405 - 00:12:26.581, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:26.613 - 00:13:05.299, Speaker A: Because when the price of Matic was just going up, then everyone was, everyone in the ecosystem was making so much money that they were just like taking on so much risk. Right? There was like Their ape appetite was at all time highs, right? So you know, even projects that might not be safe, they might not like be have the strongest fundamentals are just going to catch a bit, right? Because people have been waiting for this moment for a long time now. And now that projects are launching, you know, they're really trying to go in, right? And pull to Poly. He's a good follower here. And Snowbank is Olympus Dovework. It's kind of a harbinger of what November is about to be like on Avax. The patient have been biting their time since September waiting for the incentive funds to realize in the protocol launches this month.
00:13:05.299 - 00:13:34.671, Speaker A: Tldr. Too many apes, not enough bananas, right? So the risk appetite on Avalanche is at all time highs. So you can, you can expect these native ecosystem projects to do really, really well. Maybe in six months from now they're all going to zero, but who knows in the short term people don't care, right? They just want to see something new and ape into it. And I'm seeing that everywhere, right? So for example, I mean there was, there was this, right? I don't even know what this number is. Super high APYs. I believe these APIs are going to go down after 72 hours.
00:13:34.671 - 00:13:54.999, Speaker A: There's this incentivizing people to bond as much as possible with these discounts. But hey, these APIs are insane. And hey, maybe they're going to start to build out their treasury. Maybe it's a legitimate project, right? I'm not in this one, but maybe you're interested. Second is Blizz. Blizz is a money market that just launched. They already have $2 billion in TVL.
00:13:54.999 - 00:14:39.553, Speaker A: Pretty impressive. They are a fourth of Geist protocol, right? So they essentially looked at I guess Geist launching on Phantom, right? Remember back in back, back in early October I rotated to, I rotated the Phantom like in October 5th because Geist launched on October 5th and you can kind of see like the effect of Geist that had on the Phantom ecosystem. Well, essentially the team was like, you know what, like we're going to airdrop tokens to anyone that like has Geist token staked and we're going to offer similar APYs, right? We're going to forge Geist and people are excited. They have 2 billion in TVL and these APYs are insane, right? So you're gonna have to do your research. Like I consider this medium risk and if you. And I mean these rates are insane, right? I mean this is a farm token, so always be careful. And you know this is a Fork of geist.
00:14:39.553 - 00:14:40.665, Speaker A: And this is the price of geist.
00:14:40.705 - 00:14:40.929, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:40.977 - 00:14:50.511, Speaker A: So you shouldn't really expect this token to do really, really well. You might see some bullish narratives. I mean, who knows, maybe it does well. But you know, it's a fork of geist and this is what the geist token has done.
00:14:50.593 - 00:14:50.811, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:50.843 - 00:15:19.395, Speaker A: So it's, it's a farm token. It's a farm token. But if you're a farmer, maybe you're interested, right? Maybe you can deposit some Avax, earn super high, super high yields, borrow USDC, redeposit USDC, borrow USDC, redepolit USDC and kind of keep looping your position. So the TBL isn't actually 2 billion. Maybe it's more like 600 million. And people are just like lubing it so they can like form more bliss tokens. But hey, like, you know, it's, it's an exciting ecosystem project and people are aping.
00:15:19.395 - 00:15:52.861, Speaker A: Yeah. So I do want to touch on, I guess the safer place that I guess are working on something that's super innovative. So benqi is something that, you know, I started covering in mid August and was primarily the reason I rotated into Avalon ecosystem. And you know, they have VC backing. They're a good, good project. They have a bunch of different backing, a bunch of TVL as well. But you know, I do want to highlight one thing that they're doing called liquid staking that I think is going to be a really bullish catalyst for just the entire ecosystem.
00:15:52.893 - 00:15:53.109, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:53.157 - 00:16:18.607, Speaker A: Because you can't just like fork things and expect it, you know, expect it to last. You kind of have to have like sustainable innovation. And I think benqi is working on that. So benqi, what they're going to do is they're going to launch liquid staking for avalanche network, providing the seamless unlocking of staked assets to be used on the AMALG chain. So there's a bunch of people that like take their avalanche and stake it right. Like delegate it right to a validator and they earn roughly 8 to 10% interest on their avalanche. Right.
00:16:18.607 - 00:16:41.885, Speaker A: To help with the decentralization of the entire ecosystem. What BENQ is working on is allowing those staked avalanche on, I guess the P chain and being able to use that staked avalanche as collateral on benki. So imagine there's billions of, I believe there are billions of avalanche staked on like, on like the avalanche P chain that's just sitting there.
00:16:41.925 - 00:16:42.245, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:42.325 - 00:17:35.585, Speaker A: But what if you can take those staked avalanche tokens, use it as a collateral banking and borrow against it. Because there are a bunch of people that like, that have like Avalanche exposure, right? Like they bought into Avalanche because of like whatever reason and they're staking it, right? They're not really into Defi, but through these products, you can imagine people saying, oh, wait, I'm earning 8% on avalanche and I can use it as collateral and banking and borrow against it and form on Curve. Ooh, that's crazy, right? Like, I mean, obviously you can already earn like 15% on AAVE, right? Like without having to stake in whatnot. But you can kind of see like from like a customer acquisition perspective and from like growing the pie of the entire Defi ecosystem, the Avalanche ecosystem. I think this is a really cool innovation that they're working on that's kind of being slept on. And the Benky team, they're real, right? They're real. I mean, I can, I consider Benky to be a safe, safe risk, if that makes sense.
00:17:35.585 - 00:18:32.235, Speaker A: And then another thing I want to go over is ampleforth coming into BenQ, right? So if you don't know what ample fourth is, they're an Ethereum based protocol. So I was never really interested, right? It's like the gas fees are way too damn high. But if Ampleforth is coming into Avalanche and it has lower fees, it gets me more interested. So Ampleforth is a rebasing token, right? It's an algorithmic stablecoin, I guess, where if the price of AmpleForward is, I guess over a dollar, it's going to increase the amount of AmpleFort in circulation to incentivize people to sell that token. Whereas if the price of amplefort is below a dollar, it's going to contract the supply to disincentivize sellers, if that makes sense. The importance of Amplified being listed on the money market is pretty incredible because Amplifort, this is AAVE on the Ethereum blockchain and they were recently listed on AAVE. And people taking their ample worth can earn 87,000% APY on their ample worth.
00:18:32.235 - 00:18:49.475, Speaker A: Like, how is this possible, you might ask? Well, because it's a rebasing token and people expect the price of ample ports to go down, right? Like you should expect ample for it to go down because of the rebases. So what people are doing is that you can take, essentially borrow ample for it, sell it, and effectively short the ample for the asset.
00:18:49.515 - 00:18:49.691, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:49.723 - 00:19:44.619, Speaker A: Which makes sense, right? So because everyone wants a short ample for it, the borrow APY is 186,000%, meaning that you can take your Amples deposit as collateral. And as long as you don't, as long as you think that the price of ample is gonna, you know, be above a dollar, right, it's gonna be some insane apys, right? And it's kind of interesting because like both the borrower and the depositor is making money, right? Because sure, these guys are paying a bunch of interest, but they're shorting ample for it, right? Because you know, ample for it is gonna keep expanding if the price of ample is above a dollar and if you think the price of ample isn't going to dump immediately, right, you can collect this crazy apy. This isn't a viable strategy for most people, but if it's going to be listed on Avalanche, right. On Benki, I can kind of imagine a bunch of TVL going into here. I mean there's only 22 million in TVL so that's like nothing. But it's something that's interesting and maybe it's worth your attention. The last two safest forms I'll go over first is Alpha Homura.
00:19:44.619 - 00:20:31.725, Speaker A: They are leveraged yield farming protocol. It's kind of like tarot on the, on the, on the Phantom ecosystem where you can kind of just like take, you know, these positions. I think I have to go to the dashboard. Yeah, you can kind of lever your positions, right? So you can take your Avalanche each position, lever it up and earn 170% which you know, I'm personally not interested in doing. But you know, if you want to, you know, if you want to earn higher yield, feel free to do so. And what you can do if you want to be a more conservative farmer is that you can take, you can take your USCC USDT Avalanche and you can lend it to these degens, right? So these degens, they want to leverage geoform and higher APYs. But you know, you can lend out your assets to these degens and they'll pay you these interest rates to borrow from.
00:20:31.725 - 00:21:04.643, Speaker A: So, you know, it's pretty cool. I think it's 52% on tether, right? You can borrow on AAVE. Like you can be paid to borrow Tether on Ave, redeposit it back into Alpha Homura. Not so bad, not so bad. So last thing I'll touch on for the Avalanche ecosystem is the pool factory being available on Curve. So this is, I mean this isn't like a crazy bullish news catalyst I guess for the ambulance ecosystem, but I guess it is important for this entire ecosystem to be bolt out. So I guess before this factory came out Right.
00:21:04.643 - 00:22:06.207, Speaker A: That the only things available on Curve was like this AAVE pool, this REM BTC pool and the HR crypto pool. But through these factories, anyone can essentially build out, I guess, these pools to facilitate stable pair assets. And why that is important is because this is an example of something that's happening, happening on the Phantom ecosystem. Whereas I guess Abracadabra and that team was able to create this 33 pool of magic Internet money tether and USDC and create a pool for it. And this essentially improves the liquidity for memory money, which is going to help with I guess this one, but it's going to help facilitate cap like capital efficiency for the token. And if there's more utility for the MEM token, then that helps, I guess, the demand for the spell token and the entire ecosystem. So what that's happening, what's happening here? And this is like one of my favorite forms I talked about where you can deposit Stablecoins into the three pool pair and earn 23% on your stablecoins.
00:22:06.207 - 00:22:34.775, Speaker A: This kind of went down just because their team has been lowering emissions, right? Like since they're so successful, they don't have to offer such high emissions anymore. So what why this factor is important is because in the future, right, if more ecosystems want or if more applications wants to deploy onto avalanche, they might need like disability to create their own pool, right. If you look at here, there's like a bunch of these protocols that I've never heard of. Like Aquarius. Like I don't know, I don't know what that is. Dola. It's part of inverse finance.
00:22:34.775 - 00:23:18.955, Speaker A: And because no curve has opened the factory mode. Factory mode, you know, these new primitives, these new applications can create their applications improve liquidity for the stable coins. They can incentivize liquidity for the stable coins by offering I guess like emissions, like they're incentivizing MIM liquidity by offering like farming incentives, right? Lots of tvl. So you know, the Avalanche ecosystem is being built out. You can, you should expect, you know, more bullish catalysts for this ecosystem. I mean, prices follow, right? Prices doing well, maybe if you want passive exposure to the Avalanche ecosystem, maybe Avalanche token, right? Especially if you can earn 15% on here, right. Joe might be a riskier bet Wonderland.
00:23:18.955 - 00:23:59.393, Speaker A: I mean their treasury is full of Avalanche. So that's what I'm gonna do all or if you can look into these new products launching mid to late November, that could be a higher rate of play that you should be interested in. So that was a long Explanation of the ecosystem. Let's kind of go over Terra. It's doing really well and I expect this to keep continuing, right? Maybe it's, it's the upcoming news, catalysts are being priced in. But you know, I think Terra ecosystem is a super bullish one and I kind of want to go over why that is. So first of all, the entire, I guess the thesis behind the short term play of Terra is this Astroport airdrop, right? This is going to be retroactively airdropped for active TFI users.
00:23:59.393 - 00:24:47.447, Speaker A: If you are, if you never used terror applications, you can't be eligible, right? So there I'm going to assume that, you know, this airdrop is going to make I guess the terror community more money which is going to be a good way to I guess increase I guess exposure and excitement for the ecosystem. There was also going to be a bunch of I guess ways to farm Astro, right? Once astroport launches in mid to late November and just letting you know, I will be farming the hell out of this, I'm going to be bullish to Astro Token. So obviously Anchor is a good pool, right? I've been talking about Anchor for a while now. I was able to farm roughly this much anchor, right? Just like you know, just borrowing funds. The borrow apys aren't that high anymore. But you know, if you can borrow UST 4.2%, stake it here and earn 19.5%,
00:24:47.447 - 00:26:01.435, Speaker A: there's nothing wrong wrong with that. And Anchor Token has been strong. And for those that weren't aware, like if you staked on Anchor, if you staked Anchor Tokens on Anchor back in September, you got the PSI airdrop, right? This airdrop here I got like $800 worth which was like pretty insane to be honest because I only staked like $600 with anchor back then. But I'm actually super bullish this protocol. So what this does is this kind of builds on top of the Anchor protocol where you know, back I guess back in May when the price of Luna dumped, I mean this is like this doesn't look like anything but this is like an 80% dump peak to trough like 83%, right? This was a painful time for the Terra Maxis because what people did was they, they kind of leveraged their position, right? Luna as collateral, borrow USD, Buy More Luna, right? And like when the price of Luna dumped a lot in May 20, you know, a bunch of people got liquidated and I guess Nexus is trying to mitigate that by building these vaults where it helps people, people's positions from being liquidated. So for example, right now you have to manage, you have to manage your position actively by yourself. But if you put it into this vault, they will automatically delever your position for you.
00:26:01.435 - 00:26:30.745, Speaker A: So if the price of Luna dumps 40%, the nexus will automatically delever your position to make sure that you won't get liquidated. And this strategy is Roughly, you're earning 8% Luna and 8% on either, which is pretty good. And the cooler thing that you can do here is you can actually take those assets to farm with so psi USD. Psi is the token for this protocol, right? Earn 270%. Right. Keep in mind like a bunch of people are getting airdrops. So like you know, a bunch of people have this token.
00:26:30.745 - 00:26:58.448, Speaker A: So not sure how the price will do. But you know, I am currently in this farm. You can also provide liquidity for and Luna and Eth. So Nluna is I guess similar to a USD, right? So if you take beat and put it into this vault, the B Luna vault, you will get N. Luna in exchange, right? So Nluna is essentially Luna earning a percent interest and you can take that to farm with, right. And earn 165% on Luna. 246%.
00:26:58.448 - 00:27:27.637, Speaker A: 246% on Eth. Not bad, right? I'm not in this, I'm in the. I'm in this one, but I think it's gonna be an interesting one. And I gave a shout out to his channel earlier last week on Thursday I believe. But he has, he has a 15 minute video going over like how this actually works if you're interested. So you know, Avalanche, Luna, bullish those ecosystems, obviously bullish Bitcoin in Ether. And generally my strategy, it's not that complicated, right? I'm not entering new farms every single day.
00:27:27.637 - 00:27:51.285, Speaker A: I'm mainly using bitcoin Ether as collateral, borrowing against it, entering farms and then with Luna and Avalanche. Well, I don't have too much exposure into Avalanche, so any significant dips will be blocked by me. But you know, I've. I've been focusing my buys on Luna, so hopefully this does. This keeps doing well. So let me know if this is a super long video, but thank you guys for watching and have fun for me out there.
