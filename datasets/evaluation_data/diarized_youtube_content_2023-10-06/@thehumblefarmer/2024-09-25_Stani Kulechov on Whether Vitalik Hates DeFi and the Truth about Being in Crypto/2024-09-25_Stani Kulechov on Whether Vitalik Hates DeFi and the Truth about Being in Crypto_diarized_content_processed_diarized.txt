00:00:00.240 - 00:00:06.033, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Taiki here. Welcome to episode 25 of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I'm joined by Stani. How are you doing today?
00:00:06.129 - 00:00:07.857, Speaker B: Very good, very good. Thanks for having me here.
00:00:07.921 - 00:00:14.705, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. It's an honor to have you. So how's your week like with Singapore Token 2049?
00:00:14.785 - 00:00:34.087, Speaker B: It's been actually quite busy. I'm happy to be here because Singapore feels like an intersection of everyone coming from APAC and also from the west and that's where the all crypto meets. So I'm super excited to be here in Singapore.
00:00:34.191 - 00:00:55.411, Speaker A: Yeah. And I met some incredible people and I definitely come back here again. But I just want to talk about your life story. I feel like that's something that isn't talked about. I feel like a lot of people in crypto, they just talk about what's happening right now. Markets eth is bad, people seem to be more negative. But I want to focus on your story.
00:00:55.411 - 00:01:03.815, Speaker A: So when I was doing more research, I read that you started coding at the age of 12. So what got you interested in coding?
00:01:04.235 - 00:01:53.101, Speaker B: It's actually when I was growing up, my parents bought a computer and I think that was in 1998. And I have a brother who was five years older. So we started immediately having this access into Internet and access into vast amount of information where you couldn't have before. So I mean life before that even I was very young. Where you actually get information is mainly from parents, school, friends, libraries effectively. And what the Internet actually enabled is that now you have all the world's information at your hands. And obviously later e commerce emerged so you can basically buy anything that you need you don't find in your, let's say, hometown.
00:01:53.101 - 00:03:08.629, Speaker B: And I grew up in Finland in the Nordics, which is kind of like a small country, a little bit slightly bit disconnected of the rest of the world in some ways. So for me it was like a really exciting opportunity to learn a lot of things. And coding was something that we did in our household because, you know, you could actually create software applications and homepages. And I started with very simple things like just using HTML CSS and create simple web pages for all kinds of things that were hobbies or just sharing content essentially. And a little bit later, and that was a time when my brother was more interested in actually operating systems like Linux and programming kernels and doing more of a low level things where I was more interested about the Internet and access and those type of things. And then I started to move to program more kind of like more challenging things like with PHP and creating applications. And that's just how it evolved.
00:03:08.629 - 00:03:47.463, Speaker B: And we basically were gaming quite a lot. So we love to play games as well, like Counter Strike and host lawn parties as well, where it's essentially. I don't think everyone maybe knows what Alarm Party is, but it's a kind of like a small event. You bring a group of people to your home and you connect your computers and then you play the same game with your friends as a team against another team somewhere in the world. And that's basically a lamp party. So it started from that type of growing up with a computer and online.
00:03:47.639 - 00:04:05.687, Speaker A: Yeah. So it seems like you were interested in I guess the connectivity and I guess with Internet there's E commerce. I think at the age of 15 you worked on an application for users to buy, like how to guides online. So were you always entrepreneurial? Did you want to know what you wanted to do when you grew up?
00:04:05.831 - 00:04:33.859, Speaker B: Yeah. What I noticed is that Internet was this kind of like a force of opportunity. So it just felt for me like a land of a lot of opportunities. And I felt like a lot of things are missing from the Internet. So when I was growing up, Internet already existed. So there was a lot of things. Email was pretty much kind of like a common.
00:04:33.859 - 00:05:35.499, Speaker B: It wasn't as efficient as today. Email boxes might be like 50 megabytes or less. But there was a lot of infrastructure and a lot of business being built. Google was becoming more popular, new browsers and just better technology and infrastructure to interact with the Internet and kind of like there was a lot of things that were missing. And I like the idea of collaborating online and things like wiki was a big thing when I was growing up as well, where you could just get a bunch of people online across the world to contribute to news sources and create content and create a source of information without actually people needing to go to libraries to read information. So for me that was a big thing. And creating online guides was just one kind of a project that I was building.
00:05:35.499 - 00:06:37.189, Speaker B: And there were so many things that I actually built and just didn't have the intention to actually create any kind of profitable business. The only time I was thinking about profitability at that age, I mean you're super young still in your teen years, enough to pay the domain and web hosting services. In fact, I got one of my first paychecks from Google. So I put different kinds of ads into these web pages that I was building. And it was like a weird feeling to being able to earn on the Internet. And another interesting realization was when you started to try to sell things online and you integrated like PayPal or Stripe. And it felt interesting that online, every company kind of like or any business is on the same page.
00:06:37.189 - 00:07:01.895, Speaker B: But you can tell a difference how big of a business or a company behind a website is, which was kind of like fascinating. And the second fascinating part is that your market is global, so you don't need to think locally as a market, but actually whatever you can create and sell, you have a global market and audience. And I think that was something that is exciting for me.
00:07:02.015 - 00:07:10.035, Speaker A: Got it. So I guess one question for you is if you were so into the Internet and connectivity, why did you decide to pursue a degree in law?
00:07:10.815 - 00:07:55.375, Speaker B: Honestly, really interesting question. When I was growing up and I asked my dad what, what I should be when I grow up, my dad always said you should be a programmer, lawyer. He was making up this profession that didn't really exist, but this is how he was thinking about the future. And I was programming pretty much on a daily basis. Maybe I took some breaks where I was doing a lot of sports. I was playing ice hockey, that's a very popular sport in Finland, football as well, doing some martial arts. So I had so many hobbies and sometimes I took maybe a few months of a break or a year.
00:07:55.375 - 00:09:02.787, Speaker B: But I always came back to actually software one way or another. And at some point in my early 20s, I was more excited about financial applications and fintech because I realized that the whole financial infrastructure and the way we interact with payments is extremely outdated. Obviously the banking system, but also the idea of online payments. If the financial infrastructure will be borderless, frictionless, there's so many interesting financial applications and opportunities. We can actually build for people and connect people and just create more efficient financial infrastructure, even like payments and whatnot. So I got really excited about fintech and I started to build fintech based applications. One particular was a marketplace to basically sell your payouts as kind of like a developer or creator from online platforms.
00:09:02.787 - 00:09:55.315, Speaker B: So let's say if you are a game developer and you're earning on App Store a certain amount, you get paid every one month or so. Same if you are earning from creating content on YouTube, you're getting payouts every month. So my kind of platform was about being able to get a loan against your future earnings of those digital platforms. And there were some things that there was a lot of benefits of doing that. And that was the time when you had a lot of peer to peer lending. Marketplaces became a big thing and you saw a lot of investments coming into that space. But the regulation also overcomplicated a lot of these business models and made them really hard to pursue.
00:09:55.315 - 00:10:53.173, Speaker B: And I think at that point kind of like I was investing so much time into learning regulation, legislation and just overall kind of like how the business world works like beyond like being a creating like software. And at that point I actually dropped out of high school earlier to build things. So I wanted to actually get a degree, university degree. So I had to go back to high school and then I finished that in like a half a year. So that was really quickly. And then I had to choose between I like computer science and law and I realized that computer design is something that I've done so much so I don't feel that it's going to be value added at the moment. And then law is more something that I don't have enough knowledge, which could be really helpful for me.
00:10:53.173 - 00:11:08.389, Speaker B: So I went to law and at the same time was still building things. So for me it made a lot of sense. And actually end of my studies I actually started to learn even more about technologies and more about Ethereum.
00:11:08.517 - 00:11:12.865, Speaker A: Got it. So speaking of eth, when did you discover eth?
00:11:14.565 - 00:12:06.555, Speaker B: Probably the very first time was at the very beginning of 2016. Um, maybe like first time I heard about it was 2015. But 2016 beginning was when I started to kind of like more read about it and learn. And that was the, if I remember that was the year of the DAO hack when kind of like things really there was like a little bit of like chaotic behavior in the ETH community at that point. But I didn't really, I wasn't that excited about the kind of like a DAO type of organization where it's about capital, location and whatnot. That wasn't really that exciting to me. But what was exciting to me actually I stumbled upon in some of these decentralized applications so called dapps back in those days.
00:12:06.555 - 00:13:06.513, Speaker B: And I remember there was this website called the State of the dapps where if you build anything on Ethereum, even from financial applications, lotteries, some games and whatnot, that was the place to just list your dapp. And they were super clunky back in those days and hard to interact and it was just like an extremely early period. So in that summer 2016 I kind of was quite excited about Ether Delta, which was a decentralized exchange and it didn't really get any traction at the beginning and I thought it was very interesting that you can actually exchange value with other users without actually giving your custody of the funds. And you can ensure that the smart contracts execute in a certain way. And you have this transparency. You can calculate how much people are paying and paying for different tokens, for example. So it didn't get much traction.
00:13:06.513 - 00:14:15.509, Speaker B: And I remember I was trying to buy and sell certain Tokens back in 2016 summer and it took like a week and a half to get those orders fulfilled. It was super early. And a little bit later Iter Delta started to get traction. But at that point I was thinking like, what if we can actually build a lot of this financial infrastructure on Ethereum and just create more accessible democratized finance? Because for me, what brought me into Ethereum is that it was really kind of like democratizing technology. And when you look at everything that I've done online or on chain, it's been always about how to create more democratic access and by that way creating more benefit and value. Yeah. And I started to think about use cases where you could actually earn interest on chain and also you can borrow assets against your tokens as an example.
00:14:15.509 - 00:15:15.001, Speaker B: And that was very early time. That was, I would say, like we started to work on that 2016 and beginning 2017 and I think it was March 2017 when we had our kind of like POC and the project was called Eat Lend, short for Ethereum Lending Everything at that point was called like Eat something. So Ether Delta, Eat land, eat everything. But I realized during 2017 is that what I created actually is something that people really care about. So you started to see more and more users to come and say, hey, this is a cool idea. And the product was really MVP in the sense that it has so many steps to actually being like a really good product. But I saw that actually people care about this topic so I might as well just continue building it.
00:15:15.113 - 00:15:29.815, Speaker A: Got it. So you create Eastland mvp, a minimal viable product and wow, people care about this. Let's continue to build on it. And then you ended up raising $16 million ish for the Eastland ICO, I guess. How crazy was that?
00:15:31.635 - 00:16:56.395, Speaker B: I mean it was really weird because I think at that point in terms of capital in some ways DEFI didn't really exist at that point. So you had Etern Delta, that was a self funded project by a developer. You had a bunch of projects raising funds through these token generation events, ICOs back in those days, and a lot of that was based on white papers. Whereas we had a product already at that point and it was more about building something much, much better and scaling it and for me it was interesting because I was obviously still in the university, so I was mostly working from my university housing back in those days. And I remember that there was a lot of venture capital at that year, even coming to the space and financing decentralized applications that are building something financial, which later became DeFi. But for us there was a little bit like disconnection of tapping into that capital. End of the day, I was still studying university and didn't have that much of track record of previous startups.
00:16:56.395 - 00:17:38.305, Speaker B: So for me, being able to access capital and build something like this, these token generation events was actually something that is was pretty much the only choice. But I was happy about it because it basically created a very democratic way for people to participate in something that they really believe in and back founders that they see value essentially. But yeah, I was quite surprised and also even very positively because it created us an opportunity to keep building what was important.
00:17:38.425 - 00:17:48.977, Speaker A: Yeah, King mentioned that too. Back then there was no way to really raise money, so the only way was through an ico. And even when we met Vitalik, he also wanted a new way of capital formation.
00:17:49.121 - 00:18:21.919, Speaker B: Oh yeah. I think Kane is interesting because he kind of shares similar story because he has a little bit of that remoteness. So him based in Australia, me based in Finland. And at that time for getting funded in this new decentralized financial space, you will have to be in a place like Assaf at that point. That's where a lot of these capital raises were actually happening at that point.
00:18:22.007 - 00:18:46.665, Speaker A: Yeah. So obviously the ICO and then the bear market hit went down. So what were some of the memories from the bear market? How did you continue to build despite everyone just capitulating? And do you have any favorite memories of Defi Summer when we just went basically when the concept of DEFI was validated by the market?
00:18:47.085 - 00:19:57.119, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely been interesting to see how many how the cycles work. I think cycles are in every industry. I think in the crypto space there are more concrete because there is constantly kind of like price discovery every single second. And across all the categories of what people are building, I was really surprised how much people were affected by it in the sense that for me it was never about prices or valuations and that kind of stuff. For me it was more about the technology itself and what we can build. And it started more of like, let's build something really cool and useful and this could be a better way to do finance, so let's build it. And I think seeing the bear market, I definitely noticed that a Lot of people got turned down on it, and basically we saw people left the space and it was really small space still at that point.
00:19:57.119 - 00:21:09.849, Speaker B: So I do think that you kind of saw those teams that really cared about what they were building and really invested into actually building something valuable with great people. So it wasn't really the easiest time because it's kind of like you have just less people in the space. But it was a really important time for us because that time we spent actually just making our product better and making the protocol better and just thinking, what will be the next iteration. And I remember then afterwards, I think 2019 was quite a good year for us because we rebranded from ELAND to aave. And at that point we also had our first AAVE protocol version, which is a little bit different than the ELAM model built by then. And by end of the year, we were auditing the first version of the protocol. And I kind of felt really good about it because whenever we were actually talking to people, we saw more newcomers in the space that were interested in.
00:21:09.849 - 00:22:22.975, Speaker B: In the opportunity that decentralized applications can build. Well, then 2020 was obviously the launch in January and we got a lot of traction and Flash Loans was an interesting concept that people got excited about and different use cases and Defi Summer started. So my just memory about Defi Summer was that everything happened so quickly and there was just a vast amount of people actually coming and realizing the opportunity that there is in the space. And there was an influx of people of thinking what you could actually build, influx of builders, influx of users. And a lot of the early users were just Ethereum users that actually realized that there's something to. You have very interesting use cases here, and obviously you had all these yield farms, which I still think is an interesting way of actually distributing network at that point. So, yeah, the 2020 summer was probably one of the busiest times in my life.
00:22:22.975 - 00:22:41.809, Speaker B: And now that's why I'm saying that I think you've talked about this quite a lot, that now we kind of have this like a Defi renaissance happening. And last time I felt like this was in 2020 summer, essentially.
00:22:41.977 - 00:23:08.435, Speaker A: Yeah. And I also want to thank you because I got into crypto and I got really interested because of Defi Summer, but I got destroyed by the gas fees. I didn't really know what I was doing. And then when, you know, you deployed on Polygon and you had those incentives with the MATIC tokens, I was like, oh, this makes sense. Defi makes sense. I was being paid to borrow and I Think a lot of my viewers onboarded crypto through those Polygon days. So yeah, that was probably one of the most fun that I've ever had.
00:23:08.475 - 00:23:59.243, Speaker B: It's actually, you know what? It wasn't actually easy to go into Polygon because it was seen as a side chain. It still is the positive. And at aave, we usually, from a community perspective, we always try to do something new and kind of like going to the new orders and kind of like break boundaries in that way. So we listed USDT when everyone was thinking like tether is just like evil, just only as a borrowable asset. We listed assets like Chainlink, where everyone's thinking like only ETH can be a collateral and a couple of other assets. And then we actually expanded into Polygon. And Polygon is interesting because out of 2.2
00:23:59.243 - 00:24:34.241, Speaker B: million cumulative positions, I think over 1 million came from Polygon. And these are up to date. These are small deposits from 100 to 500 USD word. And that just showcases how much of impact the transaction fees are. I actually think that overall transaction Fees should be 0 for the users and borne by developers. The very little that it should cost essentially. So that was a really big movement for us.
00:24:34.241 - 00:24:52.659, Speaker B: And once we did the Polygon expansion, we started to do other expansions to other networks. But at the same time other defi projects understood that, hey, maybe this is actually a multi chain world where we're living and we have to be a little bit everywhere.
00:24:52.747 - 00:25:30.065, Speaker A: Yeah. And earlier you mentioned that you were just working a lot, you were really, really busy. And I think earlier this year in July, you had this post on hey XYZ saying that you had surgery. You had, I believe, your gallbladder removed. And I'm just going to, I guess say some of the quotes from that post and if you can kind of expand on that. But the first quote is I stupidly neglected my health, explaining to myself how busy I was. There's constant pressure for everyone in the space, whether chasing, liquidity, users, PMF or something else.
00:25:30.065 - 00:25:36.351, Speaker A: So can you just expand on, I guess, about work, life balance, forgetting about health, et cetera.
00:25:36.423 - 00:27:16.415, Speaker B: I mean, this is kind of a problem that I felt that it was important to talk about because I think there's people in the same situation because the amount of time I invested in building AAVE and also avara, the time I see kind of myself spending around these products, I see actually other founders and other contributors in the space doing the same. So for me, the hardest part was that over these years a lot of things happened and there's a lot of progress in decentralized finance and AAVER became the biggest liquidity protocol. But also at the same time, it came with the cost of actually putting all my time and energy into building aave and also Avara. And I always kind of like I tried to keep my health in a good shape, but also I neglected a lot of, let's put it this way, I didn't invest in my own wellbeing. And I think that was really sad because essentially if you can't be well, it's really hard to contribute over the long term. And any type of project or let's say a company or a protocol, it's a long term horizon. So you have to be capable of actually being here from 5 to 10 to 15 years if you want to see this technology to get wide adoption.
00:27:16.415 - 00:28:36.711, Speaker B: So I kind of postponed everything into very last minute and then there was no other choice than actually doing a surgery at that point. And actually even better, there could be worst cases and scenarios. I don't need to go to explain too much, but essentially what I wanted to send also with this post, a kind of like a message to all the founders and everyone who contributes to the space that it is a long game, nothing will break down. If you spend a few hours a month or a couple of months to just basically doing health checkups and just care about your health, diet, what you eat, exercise and sleep, which is quite important. And, and just the ergonomy on how you. Your whole work setting, do you have a comfortable chair, do you have a good lighting as well? All these things really matter, especially because in our space there's a lot of travel involved as well and you need to have a good setting and that helps you to succeed. So I think that was the message I wanted to share as well.
00:28:36.823 - 00:28:50.915, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I definitely got the message. I think it got a lot of engagement and I think a lot of people empathize or resonate with that message. I think health is not something that's talked about. I think a lot of people burn out, but maybe people think it's a sign of weakness.
00:28:51.415 - 00:30:17.617, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's hard because I have a lot of friends in the space who have had the burnout and they just, they have to disappear for maybe like six months or a year or longer time period and they come back and it's the same type of hamster wheel and then they burn out again. So I think it's just important to realize that there isn't a message generally or like an urgency of creating this whole new paradigm or this whole new next generation intranet that we're building as fast as possible. It's great. The faster we can accelerate this transition of living on a rented land over the Internet into basically people powered, people owned Internet, the better. But there's no point if the cost is like can't live your life normally, there's no point there. And life is long, so there's a lot of time ahead and build. And people who take that break and come back, they really realize that Defi is here tomorrow too, which is actually great.
00:30:17.617 - 00:30:31.195, Speaker B: And I have friends that actually take now three, four months, breaks periodically and come back. And I think that's really wonderful to see.
00:30:31.355 - 00:30:54.553, Speaker A: Yeah. So also in that post, multiple times you thanked your partner Paris and I was at the Avara dinner and I was seated next to her and we were talking about that post. But how important is she to you as an entrepreneur? And my second question is, I also realized that she's been in crypto for a very long time. What's it like to have a partner that also is in same industry?
00:30:54.729 - 00:31:25.635, Speaker B: Yeah, no, my partner is definitely the fundamental of my. Not just day to day, but also being able to do great decisions and being able to understand how to balance work and life. So I think pretty much everything where. How could I explain it in an interesting way?
00:31:25.635 - 00:31:26.707, Speaker A: It doesn't have to be interesting.
00:31:26.811 - 00:32:22.701, Speaker B: Yeah, in a clear way, I would say in everything that I do there's definitely some kind of support and in some cases there's a lot of support. But in overall there's a lot of support what I do. And I think it's really important because doing this alone is really hard. And I think everyone should have some sort of person that can support them. For example, if it's not a partner, it should be your friend or sibling or family member, someone who's really close to you. And for me that's basically Paris and it's quite privileged to work together. I think she's really talented and she has also a lot of perspective from kind of like a venture side of the thing.
00:32:22.701 - 00:33:10.161, Speaker B: So she has seen the space and she's been in the tech space before. Crypto. That's really valuable. And overall, I think working together, there are a few couples in crypto that work together in the same project and I think that's very beneficial because it really helps you to think about a lot of the kind of what kind of things needs to be built or how the space is evolving. What's important now. And I'm a kind of A person that I don't really stop thinking about things that I build. So it's kind of nice to also have these discussions at home in a more relaxed setting.
00:33:10.161 - 00:34:22.705, Speaker B: But that being said, I think there should be some sort of good separation between work and personal life. And that boils back to my writing as well that defi crypto. All this innovation is going to be here tomorrow as well. So there is really no trash to build something at your own like a personal life expense. At expense. But at the same time I do think that the reasons we are so successful is that we have this group of people at Avara that are putting everything they can to actually see us succeed. So there are times when it's all hands on deck where we just have to work extremely hard for a while to get a product launch done or engineer an architecture or basically any type of part of that product development cycle all the way to go to market.
00:34:22.705 - 00:35:12.573, Speaker B: Sometimes it's really tough environment. And Avara isn't really like our staff is quite senior. So it's not really a place where you kind of like it's not the first place to kind of go and work. Usually go and work to Avara once your experience enough. Because the things we build are very high end that might be complicated and we need people to people who know how to also simplify complex technology and also how it's applied and how we message about it and so forth. So we have this enormous energy at Avara. Great group of people and Paris is also part of that.
00:35:12.573 - 00:35:31.295, Speaker B: So I feel really good about our staff and talent we have at the moment. So it definitely isn't one person success. It really requires all those individuals that are putting energy into it.
00:35:31.415 - 00:35:52.601, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really nice to have a support system and people that believe in you. Right. Because crypto is really hard building. Everyone's trying to build or trade or anything and it's really hard. And to have someone, whether it be a friend or a partner that believes in you also gives me confidence or gives ourselves confidence to continue pushing. And speaking of believing in something. So tell me about Avara.
00:35:52.601 - 00:36:03.965, Speaker A: There's aave, of course, there's Lens family Go. What's the endgame? Let's say in a few years. What do you think you want the Avara ecosystem to look like?
00:36:04.265 - 00:37:17.265, Speaker B: Well, Avara is a lot about putting all this technology together to build the people powered Internet. So we know that Intranet started as a decentralized infrastructure that then became more centralized and the application layer is completely centralized mainly for the benefit of usability. And now we kind of realize that maybe that's not the model we want in a more like, say like a democratic society. We want some of this technology to be almost equivalent to human rights. People should have access to finance, access to same financial opportunities across globally limitless, borderless and just have more transparency about what's happening in the world, whether it's finance or other types of use cases. So obviously with AAVE we focus quite a lot on the financial use cases and creating and democratizing finance. And with Lens we're focusing on.
00:37:17.265 - 00:38:14.485, Speaker B: Actually the way I think about AAVE is that it's about financial freedom and Lens is more about that social freedom, being able to have a voice and identity, being able to have connectivity with others and ability to create content and distribute that. And I think that the way we build the Internet today, it really isn't guaranteed. So I think there should be guarantees for the people on the assets. They can own, what they want to do with these assets and also with their social capital and especially social capital. And Lens is going to be extremely important and I bake opportunity because everyone has social capital. So financial capital is very usable when you have financial capital. So that's not the case globally.
00:38:14.485 - 00:39:21.487, Speaker B: Yet half of the population doesn't have access to dollar or dollar yield. So we're still far away from that. Even it's 2024, we're not still living in a world where everything is connected and everyone has these opportunities and then obviously go is part of that big vision on the financial side and hopefully also on the social side and with family, it's going to be a gateway to access this new web. And when you put all them together we are able to create a really powerful, not just infrastructure, but actually experience layer for the users that are entering into the space. So first obviously it's your family and then accessing financial opportunities and then accessing social opportunities and benefiting both of them. So that's the kind of like a grand vision and hopefully we are going to make a significant contribution to this people powered Internet amongst all the other participants as well.
00:39:21.671 - 00:39:43.679, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely resonate with your point about I guess financial capital. Some people have money, some people don't. But not only that, you can contribute to the role not through finance, but also with social capital. And I think one time you got suspended From Twitter in 2022, that's a.
00:39:43.687 - 00:41:12.747, Speaker B: Great example where it felt like you're muted, like you lost your voice completely and you couldn't do anything. And that's the reality where we're at this point where when you don't really, if a company can have that significant power, I think that's extremely dangerous and that doesn't really guarantee connectivity or voice in certain situations. So I do think that that's why when I talk about Lens and building resilient social networks, I think about building an infrastructure that provides that access and ensures that everyone has voice. And obviously on the application layer, it's up to the apps to actually figure out how moderate content and how to actually distribute the content and create that reach and discovery. So I think it's a fundamentally big problem, especially because we interact more and more online, we create content online, we create connections online at this point and soon even more, it's going to be hard to recognize and distinguish what's authentic content and what's not. So the world is going to become very complex and we need more guarantees for users that and they can have those tools where they can preserve their ownership and access to their social capital.
00:41:12.931 - 00:41:22.975, Speaker A: Got it. So we have a few minutes left. I just want to ask some, I guess more broader life advice stuff, but if you could give advice to your younger self, what would it be?
00:41:24.835 - 00:42:02.875, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been thinking about this question because I'm mainly for a few reasons. One is I've been thinking that someone will ask this on an interview, but I think just starting to learn more broadly on different topics. I think that will be the biggest advice. I think when I was really young, let's say go like 10, 15 years ago, I was interested in a lot of things, but I kind of felt that I never went deeply enough into other subjects. So now I'm at my age now I'm picking up more some of the things that were interesting a little bit.
