00:00:00.600 - 00:00:24.970, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taki here. And today, I'm very honored to have Ben Cohen on the channel. He was actually my inspiration when I first started the channel because he has a YouTube channel with roughly half a million subscribers, and he doesn't do clickbait thumbnails, he doesn't do fancy editing. And they gave me confidence that if I keep grinding it out, make good content, I can make it as, I guess, a youtuber. So thank you for being on Ben. And how are you doing today?
00:00:25.650 - 00:00:34.138, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Thanks for having me. It's always fun to inspire others to create their own channel and whatnot. So, yeah, thanks for having me. I'm glad to be here.
00:00:34.274 - 00:00:48.030, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I guess, I mean, I don't think you need any introduction, but for those that may or may not know you, when did you get into crypto, and when was, like, delightful moment that you had when you thought that bitcoin and ETH was going to, I guess, be a thing?
00:00:48.610 - 00:00:49.018, Speaker B: Right?
00:00:49.074 - 00:00:49.290, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:49.330 - 00:01:12.260, Speaker B: Also with bitcoin, um, my undergrad was in math, and that was back in. I took a cryptography class back in 2011. We didn't cover bitcoin in that class, but we covered cryptography. And, you know, it's. It was sort of right around the time that bitcoin was also having a nice move at the time, back in. In 2011. So I.
00:01:12.260 - 00:01:49.462, Speaker B: It was on my radar then. I. Unfortunately, I was. I was a poor college kid at the time, and I didn't have any money to invest, but that was when it first got on my radar, was part of it. When it went into 2013 stuff, I watched it come crashing down. It was like, well, what's going on? What is this? Why is it not. Why is it not going up? And then in 2016, 2017, I got a little bit better of figuring out how do you actually navigate the market and whatnot? So I would say bitcoin, I first learned about it in 2011, and I got more and more on board with it as we continued on.
00:01:49.462 - 00:02:45.148, Speaker B: But even by 2013, I was sort of like, I thought it was going to be a decent crypto, decent project. I mean, I had no idea it was going to go to $64,000 at the time. But then I would say once we got through 2016 and going into 2017, it became a little bit more clear. I think that it was. It was on this long trajectory where the price is going up, right? I mean, back in 2013, we didn't have that much information, but now we have a lot more, a lot more data to look at. And we sort of can see where it's headed with ethereum. Ethereum was one of those ones back in, back in 2015, 2016, a lot of people called it a scam, and it's sort of similar to today, a lot of layer ones today, a lot of people just say they're scammed and whatnot, but that's what it was called back then.
00:02:45.148 - 00:03:41.612, Speaker B: And I also think that maximalism, whether it be bitcoin maximalism or ethereum maximalism, it actually hurts you in the long run because you sort of miss out on the gains on other projects. And so I think bitcoin Maxis missed out on what Ethereum had to offer and the ROI that was going to give back in the back in 20 15, 20 16, 20 17. And so I sort of found it interesting. And then in 2016, I was definitely getting hyped up about it. In 2017, we had the IcO mania and I thought it was a useful utility, but I always struggled to understand how something like that could be sustained forever. Just people printing ERC 20 tokens with essentially no utility but a fancy WordPress site and stuff. And then that one came crashing down.
00:03:41.612 - 00:04:17.730, Speaker B: But I'm much happier this cycle because it seems like there's a lot more utility going on in the crypto space. And Ethereum included, right? Ethereum included. So that's sort of the story behind bitcoin. And I mean, I was also invested in some other ones back then that aren't as, they're not as popular today. Right, because you have the new projects today, but that's sort of the story with bitcoin and ethereum and then now we have even newer projects, right? We have new Ellwit layer ones and whatnot that are constantly being questioned and everything. So, yeah, that's my story about jumping here into the crypto verse.
00:04:18.110 - 00:04:46.560, Speaker A: Yeah. And I can definitely relate to, I guess, being a college student, a broke college student, and like finding bitcoin and didn't have enough money to, I guess, like, take the risk and. Yeah, like, I like, I'm not a fan of maximalism. I actually like it when there are maxis in the particular ecosystem because like, they're going to die on the hill and they're going to support the project no matter what. But from my perspective, I call myself like a yield maxi. I go where the hot ball of money is, I go where the yields are because that's where the opportunity is. And speaking of other l one s.
00:04:46.560 - 00:05:21.970, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like, like Ethereum maxes right now are like they're kind of coping because they're missing out on these opportunities. And I really encourage everyone to keep an open mind when I like doing research on crypto. So, speaking of which, I feel like on your channel you cover mainly bitcoin, eth, Link, Ada, Dot, and recently avalanche. And most of those, I guess, other investments, alternative investments outside of bitcoin and ether are l one tokens, right? So is there a reason why you're like your, I guess your top conviction bets are these l one alternatives. Can you just give your thoughts on that?
00:05:22.960 - 00:06:19.524, Speaker B: Yeah, so the whole idea with these layer ones, and some people like Polkadot, Gavin would say that Polkadot's layer zero, right? But yeah, the whole idea is that Ethereum is the cream of the crop, right, when it comes to these platforms. And as far as I can tell, nothing's really a direct competitor to Ethereum. But that doesn't mean that other projects won't build their own, their own ecosystems, their own niches. They'll have these things, they'll have followings, they'll have networks and whatnot. But what they are is they're valuing different things than Ethereum. So it becomes like the blockchain trilemma, right, where you have to worry about scalability, decentralization, security and whatnot. And if you go after one or two of them, then a lot of times you come short in one of them.
00:06:19.524 - 00:07:07.798, Speaker B: So you're sort of trying to figure out, okay, well, how can we be all three? And Ethereum is trying to figure out how to be all three without sacrificing, say, decentralization. It would be easy for Ethereum if they just raise the block limit, they could decrease the fees. The gas fees would start to plummet. The reason we know this is because, again, the binance smart chain started off as a clone of go, Ethereum, and they had basically zero fees. So it's not like all of these other projects are groundbreaking technology. It's just that they're valuing something different. Okay, so if Ethereum wanted to, say, be more centralized and lower the fees, the gas fees, they could do that.
00:07:07.798 - 00:07:51.776, Speaker B: But what they're trying to do is they're trying to lower the gas fees in a way that does not compromise decentralization. And just an idea of why that compromises decentralization. If you raise a block limit, increases the computational requirements, of course, to run a node, therefore it makes fewer people able to run the node. Therefore it becomes ultimately more centralized. Now, other projects, I thought back in, back in 2019 and 2020, I was trying to figure out, well, what is the market going to value? Because there's a difference between what I value and what I think the market will value. I value decentralization. I think that bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most massively decentralized protocols, and nothing, even nothing else comes close to them.
00:07:51.776 - 00:08:37.338, Speaker B: Nothing else really, not in terms of a serious project that I would take seriously. So I'd say nothing comes close to them. And so I was thinking, what are ways that we could hedge against this? What's a way that we could hedge against going, say, all in on decentralization being the only thing people care about? And the whole idea was, well, what if people don't care about decentralization? There's going to be some people that are going to speculate on other things besides something being decentralized. And we saw the fees, we saw the gas fees on Ethereum skyrocket in 2017. And I could tell back then people didn't like that. It was a huge source of fud back then. And then not long after the fees went sky high, the whole market came tumbling back down.
00:08:37.338 - 00:09:47.272, Speaker B: And so I thought, well, how can we hedge against this? And what are market participants going to value? I said, well, there's going to be these other layer ones that are going to be sort of competing, right? Like they're, you know, I don't, I don't necessarily consider them a direct competitor, but they are, you know, they are trying to go after similar market participants. And you have Cardano, right? We have Cardano. You have, you have Polkadot, you have avalanche, you have Solana. There's cosmos, there's tezos. I mean, you could go on and on, right? There's so many different layer one platforms. And every single week someone's asking me, well, what do you think about this layer? What do you think about this other one? And so the whole idea is rather than, say, trying to invest in 50 different layer ones, pick the ones that you think will do well, pick the ones that you think will do well, and that give you exposure to something different. I mean, like, Solana is a great example of a project that basically the transaction speed is so quick, you don't have to sit around for a long time.
00:09:47.272 - 00:10:39.828, Speaker B: It's super fast, but it lacks some level of decentralization. We saw that happen the other day. So I think there's this difference between something actually being decentralized and something being decentralized in name only. And so then when something happens, you actually, it's not really that decentralized so right now I think market participants are sort of, we're trying to figure out what will the market ultimately value. I think bitcoin and ethereum are the safest bets, but to only have bitcoin and ethereum, I think really minimize your potential upside. And so bye. By speculating on some of these other layer ones, you give yourself exposure to the market that has a lot more potential upside with certainly more downside as well.
00:10:39.828 - 00:11:08.662, Speaker B: But again, a lot of people that are invested in crypto are interested in taking on risks as well. Thats how I came to think. Why would I want to invest in anything beyond bitcoin and ethereum? Is because if I turned my nose up to Ethereum back in, back during the last cycle, you would have missed out on a lot of gains, right? A lot of gains. So to do the same thing this cycle with newer projects, you'd basically be making the same mistake that bitcoin max, he's made on Ethereum. So that's where I'm coming from.
00:11:08.846 - 00:11:43.820, Speaker A: Yeah, and I definitely agree. I feel like my thesis is in the short term, the market does not care about decentralization. We saw this in Q one, but binance smart chain, it went on in a huge bubble. And I mean BnB even, I think roughly it's at dollar 300, but it opened a year, roughly dollar 30. And then after the crash, people were like, okay, what's next? Q two polygon, right? It's also centralized, but that's how I grew my channel. It was like I was just forming on Polygon. And then Q three, now we are having these other chains with liquidity mining incentives, like avalanche, phantom.
00:11:43.820 - 00:12:29.580, Speaker A: Solana didn't have any incentives, but they have a bunch of backing. So I feel like every quarter there's a new l one that people really like. You know, it's a battle of like, oh, it's like, oh, this is going to threaten Ethereum. I think in the long term it's not going to. I don't really see like a value proposition that these like the flavor of the quarter have over Ethereum. But you know, I guess with my channel it's like in the short term, let's take advantage of these opportunities because, you know, if these foundations want to throw money at us, then why not just take them, right? So let's transition over to bitcoin and ethereum because those two are also my core holdings in my portfolio, even though I don't really talk about them on my channel, partly because with bitcoin I can't really talk about bitcoin every single week. There's not much to talk about.
00:12:29.580 - 00:13:19.710, Speaker A: And with ether, I feel like 90% of my audience is priced out of ether, including myself. So there's no point talking about a blockchain that I can't really use. However, I feel like with your channel and with all the data, data, science and research that you do, I feel like you're leaning towards maybe in Q four, bitcoin taking over dominance again, similarly to how you did, how it did twelve months ago. And we also often talk about like the EtH BTC, Q four bleed. So can you just briefly go over like, your thesis, I guess, your macro thesis on the crypto markets, focusing on bitcoin and ETH? Because I've often talked about taking profits on avalanche soon. And with my profits, I'm going to take some profits to bitcoin into ETH because I feel like those bags are getting pretty light, at least for my personal taste, and also rotating to other old ones.
00:13:20.410 - 00:13:23.030, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. Should I go out and share my screen?
00:13:23.930 - 00:13:29.390, Speaker A: Yeah, because you're a much better ta guy than I am. Or is this like chart today?
00:13:29.730 - 00:14:10.550, Speaker B: So the whole idea always comes back to, everything comes back to bitcoin, right. If bitcoin were to dump from here, then we know it's going to affect everything else in the market. So whether you hold bitcoin or not, it's still decent to follow it because it's sort of, it controls the market. Right. I mean, like imagine back over here or remember now, you don't have to imagine like go back to May and June and July and you can see that a lot of the layer ones had, you know, they just, they dropped 60, 70%. You know, most of them did. Cardano is one of my favorite, my favorite ones, and that was the one I chose back in 2019 to be my primary hedge against Ethereum.
00:14:10.550 - 00:14:55.122, Speaker B: It's not going to stop it from dropping 60 or 70% if bitcoin kicks the bucket. So whether you hold bitcoin or not, it certainly makes sense to at least follow what its doing because it will give you the general outlook on how well the altcoin projects that youre following are going to do. Okay, so generally speaking, when bitcoin is above the 20 week SMA and the 21 week EMA, so we call it the bull market support bound. These two lines, the red ones, the 20 week SMA, the green ones, the 21 week EMA. When its above those and moving sideways, then altcoins can rally. Right? And I'm sure you see this, right? I mean, I know with avalanche and whatnot, you see how well it's been doing over the last, over the last few weeks. Solana is another one that's been doing really, really well.
00:14:55.122 - 00:15:44.186, Speaker B: Cardano was able to put a new all time highs. A lot of these cosmos is another one, right? A lot of these projects, when bitcoin is above the 20 week SMA, the 20 week, they do really, really well. And it's like they just keep going up. But the thing is, when bitcoin drops below this level, if you think back to May of 2017, what happens during that time? The bitcoin pairs bleed, and they bleed badly. It's not even just a small bleed, it's a pretty bad bleed. For instance, if we were to go look at, say, Ada bitcoin, and you go look at what happened back in May, that's when the Ada bitcoin valuation started bleeding. And then you see that Ada bitcoin took off in August, the week of August 9 here, and you go look at bitcoin.
00:15:44.186 - 00:16:10.804, Speaker B: What happened the week of August 9? That was when it opened above the 20 week. Okay. And youll see the same pattern for a lot of cryptocurrencies. Like a lot of altcoins will bleed against bitcoin when bitcoins, when its having this drop down below. And then they can start to recover during this phase over here. So you have to watch bitcoin. You have to see is it in the phase that's going to be helpful for the altcoins that you're holding.
00:16:10.804 - 00:16:38.588, Speaker B: And so right now, if you're holding a lot of these layer ones, they're doing really well, right? They're doing really well. Some of them are at all time highs. Some of them are not at all time highs. But still, if you look at the ROI over the last two months, a lot of them have seen fairly decent gains. We also know that bitcoins been above the 20 week for a while now. What would happen, though, if bitcoin either goes below the 20 week or goes into price to discovery mode? So there's two separate scenarios there. If bitcoin goes below the bull market support band, we know what'll happen.
00:16:38.588 - 00:17:02.140, Speaker B: We already experienced it in May, right. All bitcoin pairs will drop. Right? We all saw that. We all know we would expect that to happen. All bitcoin valuations will get absolutely wrecked, and all USD valuations will get absolutely wrecked if that happens. But that's not the only thing that can wreck all bitcoin valuations. The other thing that can wreck these valuations are when bitcoin is in price discovery mode.
00:17:02.140 - 00:17:46.911, Speaker B: When I say price discovery mode, what I really mean is it needs to be going parabolic. This phase over here, where it went to then sixty one k and then 64k, these were pumps for ants. This is not major price discovery mode, where bitcoins going up like two x in a month or something, it was just barely moving higher. And during this phase is when a lot of altcoins were just going absolutely crazy. So now we find ourselves in somewhat of a similar situation that we were in exactly one year ago, right? Exactly one year ago, we were in this exact same situation. Bitcoin was riding the bull market support band. That's where we are right now.
00:17:46.911 - 00:18:45.854, Speaker B: We're at that same level. And as long as we hold it, as long as we hold these levels and we don't fall below it, then all USD valuations should hold up relatively well. Now, of course, you're going to have some fluctuations in there, plus or -10% 20%, right? You're going to have these fluctuations based on the idiosyncratic risk of that individual altcoin. But if bitcoin goes parabolic, a lot of people might assume that all the alt USD valuations will follow suit. But what we actually know from historical patterns is that it actually tends to be that all USD valuations can trend higher when bitcoins going parabolic, but they usually get left in the dust, right? Everything just bleeds back into bitcoin. No one wants to miss the bitcoin move because all the money just pours back into it. And the altcoins dont rally until bitcoin calms down.
00:18:45.854 - 00:19:21.192, Speaker B: And you guys remember, and you'll probably remember that over here. Remember this move from bitcoin. October, November, December, bitcoin dominance was just shooting up, right? I mean, let's go look at it. Let's go look at the bitcoin dominance back over there. So if we, you know, here it is, right, like, so September, we saw that the dominance bottom in September of 2020. And that was the same time that bitcoin ended up holding the 20 week moving average as support, the 21 week as well. And from that point on, it bottomed at around 57%.
00:19:21.192 - 00:20:00.546, Speaker B: And then it had a rally up to around 73 or 74%, which ended up being more or less like a double top, right, because it also hit that same level exactly September 2019, right? About a year before or so. So we find ourselves in a similar situation today. We're testing the 20 week, right. We're trying to hold it as support. We just had a wick below it, but we don't care about wicks. No one's getting out of bed for a wick. We just care about will it hold it as support on the weekly timeframe, can we stay above it if we do? If bitcoin stays above it for a number of weeks and we start to go, let's say we take out 53k.
00:20:00.546 - 00:20:43.924, Speaker B: If we take out 64k, when we take out 64k, things are probably going to get heated pretty quickly. I imagine bitcoin, it's going to go back into price discovery mode. And hopefully its not the type of price discovery mode where it goes to then kind of settles back down for four weeks, but hopefully its that price discovery mode that takes it to six figures. Okay. And so during that time, lets assume that happens during that time, we would expect the bitcoin dominance to go up because thats what the market will chase. Theyll chase bitcoin because when bitcoin goes parabolic, the market sits still. Now, here's the thing that a lot of people kind of get confused about.
00:20:43.924 - 00:21:13.650, Speaker B: That doesn't mean that altcoins won't rally as well, right? We know they will. There will be, they'll trend higher with time. If you go look at, say, Ethereum, you know, Ethereum is what we should look at here. If you go look at Ethereum, what happened with Ethereum in September, October, November? Well, it trended higher. You know, I mean, it went from like $360 or so up to around 700. I mean it put in a two x in that amount of time. So it did trend higher.
00:21:13.650 - 00:21:48.074, Speaker B: But what you'll also notice is that the Ethereum bitcoin valuation though, I mean, it dropped like a rock. I mean, from September or the end of August, it went from a valuation of 0.041 all the way down to 0.02,289. I mean, this is essentially dropped if we, I mean almost, almost 50%, right? If we take a measured move here, it was around 40, 45% or so. So a pretty substantial drop. And it just was not able to keep pace with bitcoin. And the reason, and we speculated that this was going to happen back in 2020.
00:21:48.074 - 00:22:09.922, Speaker B: We said, all right, guys, expect ether to bleed against bitcoin in Q four. We also said it in 2019. We said, expect ether to bleed against bitcoin in Q four. It's not like it's that novel of a concept. The only reason we say it is because every Q four ether, bitcoin tends to go down, and this is just what we've seen in the past. Right. Ether bitcoin tends to bleed in Q four.
00:22:09.922 - 00:22:43.260, Speaker B: And what it normally does, though, is it sort of sets us up for what's going to happen, hopefully, in Q one and Q two. Right. I mean, like this move here that started in January, this major appreciation of the ether bitcoin valuation, 1800 percent or so started in January. This one here started in late December, and it took us all the way up through q two, about a 2000% move. You just see these things play out time and time again. They typically start in late December or early January. These ether bitcoin valuation shifts in the market.
00:22:43.260 - 00:23:08.296, Speaker B: And you can see this one last year also started then as well. We had 100% move back in January. We came back down and we continue along. We've seen these rally through May, we've seen them rally through May or through June before. And then by the end of the year it tends to bleed. So really the question, of course, that everyone wants to know, is it going to bleed again? I don't know. I don't know.
00:23:08.296 - 00:23:54.844, Speaker B: And it doesn't really affect my strategy, to be completely honest. I just sort of see it. If it bleeds in q four, then I would more or less just see that as an opportunity to DCA into Ethereum in hopes that it continues the same pattern in q one and q two of the following year. Because every single time we've had a q four bleed, which has literally been every single year, it also followed up with a nice move in q one and q at least q one and sometimes q two of the following year. So right now everyone's talking about it doesn't need to go through this bleed. And that what's more likely to happen is that it's just going to come up here and then it's going to do something like this. Hey, if that happens, I'm happy, right? I'm happy to see Ethereum keep pace.
00:23:54.844 - 00:24:37.976, Speaker B: We also have to remember, though, that everyone always says this every September. Everyone always says this. And historically, bitcoin dominance takes over a lot, especially if it's a price discovery mode. So this is what we need to keep an eye on. If bitcoin either holds the 20 week and goes parabolic, or if it dumps below the 20 week, either scenario, really, either scenario, it's more likely than not that we'll see ether bitcoin bleed against, or we'll see ether bitcoin bleed on the chance that it doesn't bleed and ether is able to keep up with bitcoin, then it sort of throws. It sort of means that, well, we can't really necessarily expect the q one ether bitcoin pump anymore, right, if the same scenarios are playing out. So that's sort of how I see it.
00:24:38.128 - 00:25:00.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I think things are sharing that. And as you always say, it's like, don't take it up with me, take it up with the data. Right. I mean, it just happens every single year historically. So, like, why fade it? It's kind of weird how seasonality works. I feel like any rational player would think that seasonality wouldn't be a thing. But if it keeps happening, then I guess there's something there.
00:25:00.620 - 00:25:47.994, Speaker A: And yeah, thank you for sharing the bitcoin bull market support band as well because I feel like my channel blew up starting in April. And I know that there's a lot of people that got into crypto in 2021 and didn't really experience the bitcoin dominance. Like the bitcoin surge in q four of last year. And I was living it and it was insane. I was like, what? Like, how is this thing at 40k in like this period of two months? Like, I was like blown away and all my altcoins were like, it's not doing anything. I mean, they went up some amount, but like, you know, it underperformed. So like I mentioned earlier, like, I don't talk about bitcoin much on my channel, but I am going to start to dc into bitcoin just because my avalanche bags are just getting too large for my taste.
00:25:47.994 - 00:25:52.510, Speaker A: And if I want to take risk off, then I want to bet on the king.
00:25:54.330 - 00:25:56.338, Speaker B: Its all about managing your risk, right?
00:25:56.514 - 00:26:24.446, Speaker A: Yeah, because like you mentioned, if it dips below the 20, sorry, the bull market support ban, then bitcoin dominance should go up because itll bleed less than the all coins. And also, if bitcoin enters price discovery, then youre better off holding bitcoin as well. So from a risk reward perspective, it does make sense to look into bitcoin as a way to go risk off if you are heavy into avax Luna or whatever other coins that I often talk about. Right.
00:26:24.478 - 00:26:46.690, Speaker B: And you can see that, I mean, exactly what you said, right. Bitcoin dominance went up when it was going parabolic last year. Bitcoin dominance went up when it dropped below the 20 week. Right. That, as you said, it's a way to help mitigate some of your risk in the event that it either goes parabolic or in the event that it dumps it just helps you navigate crypto a little bit, a little bit safer, I would say.
00:26:47.190 - 00:27:13.370, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. So speaking of safer, in the past six weeks, I've been covering avalanche and you've been bullish on avalanche for quite some time now. So I know it's one of the things you cover on your premium list with your risk dashboard. So can you just briefly go over like, yes, avalanche is putting in its 10th weekly green candle in a row. It is getting heated.
00:27:13.370 - 00:27:27.140, Speaker A: I do think it will go higher, but maybe it does make sense to de risk a little bit, at least for me personally, not financial advice. So can you just briefly go over where do you think we are when it comes to avalanche and like its own cycle?
00:27:27.600 - 00:27:56.120, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, yeah. Avalanche is one of those ones that had bitcoin not corrected back down to say forty k. I mean, you know, bitcoin is at, Avalanche was doing well. You know, I mean, we've been seeing it continue to do well. And what I was speculating on, you know, like, all right, well, avalanche rush is coming up. We're having this, you know, $180 million defi incentive program. And, and you think about this money ball that just hops around from one layer one to another chasing the gains.
00:27:56.120 - 00:28:38.424, Speaker B: Right. And so the speculation was, and I've been bullish on Avalanche well before they even had this program. I mean, I first spoke about it on my channel a long time ago. But the idea was, all right, well, we've seen some of these other smart contract platforms pump and do really well. And so like, for instance, with Cardano, my speculation was it'll pump into smart contracts and then it'll probably then kind of have a lull after that. I was like, well, whats something that isnt going to have a lull in the short term? I was like, I think Avalanche is looking really strong as we head into the next several weeks. And my speculation was that if bitcoin doesnt correct, then its going to be very, very strong.
00:28:38.424 - 00:29:22.820, Speaker B: Now, unfortunately, we did get a bitcoin correction. So its just the game that you play when bitcoin gives you the ideal conditions, the altcoins can absolutely go parabolic when it corrects, then bitcoin or then bitcoin has a way of mitigating the potential gains that altcoins can see. Now with that said, bitcoin dropped from fifty three k to forty k and now its back at 44. Avalanche still hasnt even had a red weekly candle. It shows you how strong, it shows you how strong Avax has been over the last ten weeks. Because I think, as you mentioned, this is like ten weekly candles in a row that are just one green after another. And so I think that the momentum is there.
00:29:22.820 - 00:29:53.540, Speaker B: The main thing I think in the short term that would stop avax from continuing to pump higher would be bitcoin dropping. Right. Like if bitcoin has some catastrophic drop or something where it, where it just goes straight past the 20 week and it goes back down to like 35k or 30k or something, or even worse, thats going to kill the altcoin market in the short term. We know thats going to kill the altcoin market in the short term. Doesnt mean they cant recover. Thats what a lot of them do. But thats what would kill it in the short term.
00:29:53.540 - 00:30:34.964, Speaker B: What were doing up here is were playing this game of all right, well, as long as bitcoin is here, as long as its up here and trading sideways above the 20 week and we have all this stuff going on, for Avaxen, the more likely path is up, and this is what ive been saying for the last several months, is that the more likely path is up. Because again, I dont really rely on traditional ta. I just try to more so rely exclusively on momentum in terms of trying to gauge what I thinks going to happen in the short term. I dont trade any of that stuff. But this is what I just think in terms of momentum. Hey, if an asset is moving up, its more likely to continue moving up than an asset. Thats nothing.
00:30:34.964 - 00:31:11.606, Speaker B: So if I had to say what's more likely to move up next week, I would say, well pick a project that's already moving up and that one's the more likely one to continue moving up than one that's, say, dropping or going sideways. Some people will say, well, you should always just buy the ones that dropped the worst. Really? No. I mean, I think you ride the racehorse, ride the race horses, and just let them run for a while. So my speculation right now is that avalanche is at $74 or so, 73. $74. We still have a ways to go if bitcoin holds the line.
00:31:11.606 - 00:31:39.122, Speaker B: This is crypto is full of a lot of if in statements. I wish I had a crystal ball, I don't. But as long as bitcoin is in this area, then I think it's more likely than not that Avax will continue to do well. And one of the ways that I navigate it is I use this risk metric. And here's the one for Avax. This is one of the ones I talk about on my channel. And the whole idea is we base the risk levels on what the asset has been able to do historically.
00:31:39.122 - 00:32:21.914, Speaker B: And for some of them, we account for diminishing returns, reduced volatility and whatnot. And we try to use these to figure out what is our risk on this asset at any given time. And what it shows is that when we get into these levels over here, when it gets dark blue or close to zero, it means its very low risk. Based on where it has been historically, its very low risk. While the price here back in July was a lot higher than it was last year, the risk on it was about the same, in fact, because again, it's basing it on what's historically done. And so now you can see we've been climbing up, right? So we went into the dark blue, dark blue over here, light blue green. So we're coming up the risk, the risk metric.
00:32:21.914 - 00:32:47.464, Speaker B: Then it turns into yellow, orange, red, and then dark red. Right now, we went from dark blue to light blue, green, yellow. Slightly off yellow here. We're getting slightly up in this region. But what it shows is that there is still room for Avax to run. Right. Doesn't mean I've seen plenty of altcoins where they don't go back up to 0.9
00:32:47.464 - 00:33:35.990, Speaker B: risk immediately. I mean, it could be a year before we get back to that level if bitcoin goes below this 20 week or something. But what it shows is that if bitcoin holds the line, like if bitcoin holds the line and Avax continues to rally, then it's not going to take very many more weeks for the risk on Avax to get to a similar risk as what we saw earlier this year before it actually came down for a while. Okay, so that's the idea, and the whole idea behind it is, doesn't mean you sell everything. If you want to take profits, maybe just skim some off the top occasionally, like you say, all right, well, if I take their color out of it and plot risk on the secondary y axis, you say, all right, well, what I'm going to do is when it gets to 0.7 risk, maybe I'll skim, like, one 10th of my position off or something. And maybe if it gets to 0.8,
00:33:35.990 - 00:34:01.900, Speaker B: I'll skim 210 off, and if it gets to 0.9, maybe three tenths, and then I'll just let the rest ride for the market cycle, however long that lasts or something. So it's just one way to navigate the market where you actually try to incorporate risk in the in how you navigate it. And you say, all right, well, you know, we're probably not going to go up forever and we can at least, at least use historical moves to try to gauge how far extended are we?
00:34:03.080 - 00:34:33.082, Speaker A: Yeah, I really like this. And yeah, this is, I mean, part of your premium list and I'm subscribed and it's a great, great service. And yeah, it's because when you're living in these moments when athlete just keeps going up and up and up every single week, its really hard to act objectively, especially because you mentioned the $180 million incentive. Well, theyre allocating 10 million tokens. And when they announced it, it was $18 roughly. So it was 180 million. But as the price keeps going up, the liquidity mining incentive becomes bigger at $100.
00:34:33.082 - 00:35:04.738, Speaker A: Avax, its a billion dollar liquidity mining incentive. And as the price keeps going up and everyone, social media, YouTube, Twitter, everyones like, oh, my God, its going to keep going up. Its going to flip all these coins. And I feel like at that point, the euphoria is going to be pretty insane. But taking more objective metrics like this, the risk metric, like what has Avax done in the past? And given what it's done in the past, what is it capable of doing? It gives me a more easier way to. Okay, maybe I should take some off at 0.7 or maybe 0.65,
00:35:04.738 - 00:35:12.190, Speaker A: roughly where we are now. It's like, maybe I should start taking off right now because it's not guaranteed we go to one, but we just know it's capable of going to one.
00:35:12.310 - 00:35:28.478, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. We're not. Nothing's guaranteed in this life, right. Except death and taxes. Yeah. So we don't really know, like what it's going to do. I should say that my Avax is locked up, so I'm not currently taking any off.
00:35:28.478 - 00:36:04.560, Speaker B: But if I hadn't, if it were not locked up, that might be a different story. But yeah, I mean, right now, right now, I think, and I think one of the interesting things with the risk metric too, is with Solana. Just two, three weeks ago, we saw the risk levels hit triple ones against USD, bitcoin and Ethereum. And it was triple ones for one day. For one day. It was when Solana went to dollar 208 or dollar 212, whatever, and then since then, it pulled back a lot. Now, I mean, of course there could be a fundamental reason behind that was what happened over on the Solana network and stuff.
00:36:04.560 - 00:36:29.620, Speaker B: But still, you know, what I say is just instead of assuming that this time is different, if you always assume that this time is not different. At least you take profits, right? Like, at least you take profits and you live to find another day. And on the off chance that this time is different, that's the reason why you don't necessarily sell everything, right? You, like, you keep some of it in case this time is different, you know?
00:36:30.120 - 00:37:29.228, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I always, I think you mentioned this too on your channel, but I always think about, okay, what's the next easiest two x with a good risk reward? And I totally think avalanche is capable of getting to $200. I mean, they have a great ecosystem, great projects, great team, a bunch of money being fueled into the ecosystem. But like, for you to, or for anyone to hold Avax from 100 to 200, that two X is going to be really risky. So my thought is, what if I can just rotate that into bitcoin, eth, maybe some stable coins to farm with or other ecosystems, because other ecosystems also have liquidity mining programs scheduled. We have phantom, we have harmony, we have Algorand, we have celo. And I'm sure more blockchains, they're going to like throw money into their own ecosystem because it works, right? Because I talked to Luigi who is the head of DeFi at Avalanche, and he said that, yeah, like we looked at Polygon, their successful liquidity mining program, and then like modeled theirs off of, of polygons.
00:37:29.228 - 00:38:23.710, Speaker A: And now all these other blockchains are like, okay, like, it works for avalanche, it works for Polygon. All right, like we're going to do phantom, et cetera. So I do think it pays to be an opportunity, maxi, right? Not an ecosystem, maxi, where, you know, just understand that there are liquidity mining programs coming in like the next in Q four, Q one, and probably more in the future. So you don't have to take on that much risk to turn a profit in crypto. Because I don't talk about leverage trading or taking on too much risk with degen Farms and whatever, but the opportunity cost of getting rugged or getting liquidated is super high because if you get rugged for $1,000, it's not just the $1,000, because it's $1,000 plus the yield you would have earned on the $1,000 plus whatever capital appreciation that you could have experienced holding bitcoin or Ethan. Right. So it's always good to manage your risk.
00:38:23.710 - 00:38:34.330, Speaker A: And that's one of the reasons why I'm thinking about, you know, taking some avalanche off, even though I think it's going to go higher because what if I'm wrong and I can't sell the top, right? I don't expect to sell the top, no one can.
00:38:35.270 - 00:38:49.660, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, it's always based on, you know, what's the risk on the next two x, right. That's the way I think about it. Let's. All right, I mean, if, you know, if it goes to 150, great. And I if it goes to 300, great. If it goes to 600 from there, great. Or 1200.
00:38:49.660 - 00:39:12.720, Speaker B: But it's sort of like people fail. I think a lot of people fail to understand that. Let's say bitcoin, for instance, goes to. Then there's some people that think it's going to go to 300k. I'm not one of them, to be clear. But writing bitcoin from one hundred fifty k to three hundred k is very, very risky. That would be a very risky move to make.
00:39:12.720 - 00:39:38.780, Speaker B: But you would also get the same return if bitcoin drops 80% and you buy it at, say, I don't know, fifty k, and then it goes up to 100k again. It's all about what is the risk on the next two x. For bitcoin to go from three k to six k wasn't that bad. Or from six to twelve wasn't that bad. Twelve to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 96, it starts to get a little riskier. And every single time it's just riskier and riskier.
00:39:39.860 - 00:40:02.564, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And, yeah, I mean, there's obviously a lot of, I mean, I feel like every, every ecosystem enters a bubble. That's. I mean, I've experienced, I mean, we saw BSC, we saw Polygon, we saw Solana Phantom, and I think avalanche is starting to enter the euphoric phase. Right. That's what I like to call it. And I don't really operate that well in euphoric markets just because it's really hard to know when.
00:40:02.564 - 00:41:14.080, Speaker A: Like, when, when will this party ever end? So I think it's really useful to have the risk metric into the crypto verse as well as just understand that no one can sell the top, no one can time the top. So let's just dynamically VCA out of the markets. Who cares if you miss out on additional gains, if you lock in gains, right? Because I'm not suggesting just cash out everything into stable coins and not do anything with it. If you rotate into bitcoin and we expect bitcoin to trend to $150,000, then thats a pretty comfy hole, at least in my opinion. With defi, you can take bitcoin, eth all l ones except bitcoin and eat as collateral almost. Money markets like Aave, theres a lot of ways that with bitcoin and etH, they have less upside on average, but they also have less downside. And I'm probably going to accumulate them in the next couple of weeks, maybe next month, anticipating the potential bitcoin dominance taking over in Q four, and then maybe accumulate some eth, too, assuming it bleeds against bitcoin.
00:41:14.820 - 00:41:24.930, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, that's sort of what I'm looking for. It's like, if it bleeds against bitcoin, I'll probably be heavily accumulating it in preparation for the bleed to stop.
00:41:25.550 - 00:41:38.970, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, I think this is a great conversation. I know. I think it was soon. I don't think it's too much of your time, but for those that want to get to know you more and want to follow you, can you tell us your YouTube, Twitter, et cetera?
00:41:40.030 - 00:42:13.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I have a YouTube channel. If you just search my name, Benjamin Kalman, you'll find it Twitter into cryptoverse and I'll have send you some of the, some of the links. And I guess you can put it maybe in like the description of the video, but yeah, definitely follow me on, on the different platforms. And if you're, if you're, if you're watching me here and you're not subscribed to this channel, I would encourage you to subscribe because, you know, you go over a lot of things that I don't talk about on my channel. So it certainly does provide like a, you know, a complementary view of the market.
00:42:14.020 - 00:42:18.220, Speaker A: Yep. Awesome. Thank you guys for watching, and, yeah, have fun farming out there.
