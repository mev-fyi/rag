00:00:00.840 - 00:00:42.318, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Taiki here and in this video I want to go over my bullcase for Uniswap ahead of the V four protocol upgrade. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord link will be in the description below where I post three weekly premium videos every single week to give you an update on my Defi research in real time. So without further ado, let's get right into the content and I know what you're thinking, right? Like uniswap governance token. Like, are you serious, bro? Like do you want to be dumped on by the VC's? You're going to underperform, right? Such a mid core play. Hopefully this video can address those concerns. Over the past couple of months, I've been calling for a Defi renaissance and this is the Gartner Hive cycle. I think a lot of Defi coins went through this phase where we had the technology trigger in Defi summer of 2020.
00:00:42.318 - 00:01:05.780, Speaker A: It pumped a lot into 2021 with the peak of exaggerated expectations and went through a trough of disillusionment. It's been trading sideways for a long time and I think now we're starting to put in an uptrend and entering the path of enlightenment. This is the aubby chart, right? I mean it went up a lot, went down a lot, traded sideways for two years. Now we're starting to put an uptrend. This is uni. I mean, overlay this chart with the Gartner hives. I mean, it looks the exact same.
00:01:05.780 - 00:01:35.070, Speaker A: So no, the question is, when I call for a Defi renaissance, does it mean that everything is going to pump? I don't really think so. I still think that 98% of Defi coins are uninvestable vaporware. But that doesn't mean that the other 2% isn't right. Good. In fact, I think they are good. I think it's so hated that I think the downside is capped and the upside is all like, clear skies ahead. And my heuristic right now at this point of the cycle is to buy quality.
00:01:35.070 - 00:02:12.200, Speaker A: I don't think we need new lending markets or dexs or lsts. I think most of the Defi primitives have already been made. It's clear that Uniswap is the leader in Dexs, aave for lending markets, etcetera. We don't really need any new primitives. So the question is, when will these tokens start to have value? And I just want to focus on Aave and Uniswap because they both have a clear catalyst at the end of year, Aave was the fee switch. Right? Just buy the fee switch, and now you're up 60% with Uniswap. I think they're going to have the v four upgrade in Q four, which I want to, you know, talk about, and all the governance shenanigans that I've done some detective work on.
00:02:12.200 - 00:02:35.988, Speaker A: So Uniswap. So on the left hand side here, you see, this is Dex market share. This is on EVM chains. So only on. Yeah, EVM chains. But Uniswap consistently has basically half the volume without any token incentives. So I think it's very clear that, you know, like all these other competitors, I mean, they can just continue to print tokens to see if they can incentivize activity, but, you know, they're all going to go to zero.
00:02:35.988 - 00:02:58.160, Speaker A: Uniswap is the leader. I do think that more and more volume is going to go from centralized exchanges to decentralized exchanges. Of course, we're still not there yet. Right. Only, like, you know, 13 ish percent here. But I think this is going to be a secular trend, which I think Uniswap can capitalize on. Uniswap at the date of their video I'm recording this on Wednesday is roughly $6.6
00:02:58.160 - 00:03:12.826, Speaker A: billion. Not. Not too cheap. Right. But, I mean, last cycle hit, like $50 billion. And the first counterargument is that uni is a worthless governance token. And I agree, it has been a worthless governance token for four years.
00:03:12.826 - 00:03:46.210, Speaker A: That's a very long time. But I also addressed this in my Aave video where I said, yeah, like, it is true that buying Defi coins might feel risky because, yeah, you know, they're worthless governance tokens. However, they're not gonna be worthless forever. Right. Just because some, you know, something has been worthless for, like, the past four years doesn't mean that it's gonna be worthless for the next four years. Right? It's like, if you see a fat kid in school, like, you know, he can go on a diet, like, you know, things can change. And, you know, I gave this example of maker eat maker, right, was clowned by everyone as, like, you know, it's going to zero.
00:03:46.210 - 00:04:31.460, Speaker A: But they did a fee switch June of last year, which I covered on this channel, and then, you know, make or eat has bottomed since that date. And similarly, Aave put out this proposal, I believe. Yeah, the 29 July. And ever since that date, you know, I was, like, buying Aave ahead of it, staking them, and, you know, like, ever since the video, Aave has gone up over two x, aave bitcoin, almost two x, and then Aave USD is up also 50%. And, you know, people still don't believe in the Defi renaissance, and that's fine, right? If everyone believes in it, then there's no edge. If no one believes in it, then there's much more upside, because if no one believes in it, no one owns it, no one owns tokens. So, you know, if that positioning or if people are offsides, then they have to buy back in, if, you know, if I am right.
00:04:31.460 - 00:05:18.490, Speaker A: So, unfortunately, Uniswap is still a worthless governance token, like where it is now. But I've done a lot of detective work on the V switch, and I want you to keep an open mind, and I don't think anyone has done this work. So hopefully, it's somewhat useful or insightful, whether or not you end up buying into this or not. So when it comes to the V switch, I don't really have any. No one knows, right? The only people that know are maybe, like, team members in the Uniswap foundation. But for me, my job as a capital allocator and a researcher is to look at all the facts, assess the risk reward of specific coins, and place my bets accordingly. And while I was doing this for the past couple of months, here are some interesting tidbits that I found.
00:05:18.490 - 00:05:53.502, Speaker A: So, if you remember, February 23 of this year, Uniswap foundation put out this proposal to upgrade a protocol such that its fee rewards uni token holders to have delegated and staked their tokens. On this day, Uni went up 80%. I was in disbelief. Like, literally, Uni became a $7 billion token from a $7 billion token to a $13 billion token in a single day. I was sidelined, and I was in disbelief. But what that told me was that the market will clearly bid uni once there's some path towards value. Cool.
00:05:53.502 - 00:06:16.090, Speaker A: I think everyone can agree on this. Uni is worthless. It's going to be worthless until it's not. I have no idea when it's not going to be worthless. Therefore, I cannot buy. But if you are able to buy ahead of a potential fee switch, then that's going to be at least an easy two x with limited downside, because no one owns Uni. However, the final boss here is the SEC and Andreessen Horowitz.
00:06:16.090 - 00:06:46.406, Speaker A: Or a 16 z, of course. And if you look at the timeline of this proposal, which eventually got shut down on May 24, Uni foundation put out the this proposal, hey. Or put out this post saying we're going to vote on this next week. And then next week they said a stakeholder raised a new issue relating to this work that requires additional diligence on our end to fully vet. Unfortunately, we've made the difficult decision to postpone this vote. I'm sorry. We're going to keep everyone updated for when we, you know, for future timeframes.
00:06:46.406 - 00:07:24.780, Speaker A: So keyword here is postpone. So they were gung ho, right? They were down to vote on this, but a 16 D stepped in and said we have to delay it. So we already know that they're down to do this. It's just that when are they going to do it? And maybe the retail sentiment is VC's or anti value cruel, whatever. But Dan Robbins, in a paradigm, he's a VC in uniswap. He was frustrated that a 16 Z would bully the token governance process to delay community proposal, community proposals at the last minute in order to advance their own pet project. What are those pet projects? I have no idea.
00:07:24.780 - 00:08:05.022, Speaker A: But the fact is they were down to vote on this. They were about to vote on it. It got pushed back, but the foundation and some VC's were for it. But it's just that a 16 z just pushed it back. So from my perspective, after following this ordeal, I told myself I really need to follow what a 16 z is doing and what their stance is on governance and fee switch to token holders. Because if they pivot their stance and there's reasonable, reasonable reasons or. Yeah, like if there's reasons to believe that they're pivoting their stance, I need to pay attention because there's a really easy two x, like sitting right in front of my face, even like a three to four x.
00:08:05.022 - 00:08:41.910, Speaker A: And interestingly, this is August 8 of 2024. On the A 16 Z crypto blog, they put out this article, new financial model for app tokens how to generate cash flows. Interesting. In May, they told Uni to delay the proposal, and then two and a half months later they're now putting out an article to drive revenue to token holders. So I kind of dug in deep. I'll link this in the description below if you want to go over it, but I'll give you a TLDR. So they go over three main ways to drive revenue to token holders in a regulatory compliant way, and I'll go over each one by one.
00:08:41.910 - 00:09:28.730, Speaker A: And let's also assume that the A 16 Z crypto team knows way more about the state of crypto regulation than any of us. So if you see a random person on Twitter saying that they're not going to do this, I mean, I would trust a 16 Z crypto over some random dude on Twitter, right? Or even me, for example. And like, you know, because of that, I'm deferring, right, my expertise to them because they probably know a lot more than I do. So the first point was staking for certain jurisdictions. So they're essentially saying that right now there's no revenue share because there's three main issues with governance, with legal risks, value distribution, with the how we test and then regulated activity. So if someone steals money and then they make a swap and you earn some fees for that, then that's illicit activity. That's not great.
00:09:28.730 - 00:09:51.650, Speaker A: And oh, by the way, this is Mason hall, the author for that blog post that I've highlighted earlier. And they say that in this model. Actually, let me explain the model first. So like I said, staking for certain jurisdictions. So maybe the US has a hostile regulatory regime. So maybe if you're staking your token for the us front end, you can't have fees. However, maybe in Asia, right? The asian front end.
00:09:51.650 - 00:10:30.482, Speaker A: Asian or Asia dot uniswap.org, i mean, whatever, right? There's a different front end for, I guess, asian swaps or swaps by asian people. And if the asian front end generates a million dollars in revenue, you can stake your unitoken in Asia or for the asian front end and receive fees for that particular front end. This doesn't seem that practical, but, you know, doing so would allow, you know, in this model, governance offers no extra burden. The app token is now entitled to cash flows and users are incentivized to buy and stake the token in a compliant way. So let me repeat this. The a 16 Z crypto person is saying that by doing this, you can do value, you can do revenue share.
00:10:30.482 - 00:11:07.520, Speaker A: Right? Interesting. Second point rewards certain types of behavior, such as, you know, fees going to people that vote. So Miles Jennings, who is the other author for, a co author for the article, talks about, you know, let me go over these points one by one. So first, a lot of people believe that protocol fee accrual to tokens creates risk under securities laws because it satisfies the for profit prong of the Howie test. But he thinks that the risk is overstated. And he's saying that, I mean, if you're buying a token, you're kind of buying it for the expectation of profit anyways. So it doesn't really matter if there's value.
00:11:07.520 - 00:11:33.324, Speaker A: Cruel or not. I mean, you know. Yeah, that's basically what he's saying. And the bigger risk he's concerned about is whether combining voting rights and economic rights like that might create issues under securities laws. So that's why they have suggested that protocols use governance minimization where possible and where it isn't, they should consider the do now. And by doing so, they could enable fee models without increasing risks under securities laws. So there is a chance.
00:11:33.324 - 00:11:45.148, Speaker A: Right. With some point in the future, Uniswap says, where the foundation says, okay, we're not even gonna vote on this. Right. Value. Cool. Happens now. I mean, I'm not sure, or I'm not really sure if that's what they mean.
00:11:45.148 - 00:12:14.986, Speaker A: But I do want to focus on the Doona aspect, because I never heard of the Doona. And I looked into this, and there's interesting takeaways from this article from March 8 of 2024 by Miles Jennings, the Doona and the oasis for the analyst. Like I said, I'll put everything in the description below. So, you know, I'll just touch on the main topics. What is a Duna? On March 7, the Wyoming decentralized unincorporated nonprofit associations act was signed into law with an effective date of July 1. So this is the Duna. Right.
00:12:14.986 - 00:12:41.772, Speaker A: Duna. And this was signed into law July 1 or effective date July 1. So, okay, maybe a 16 Z said, don't do this. Vote in May. Let's incorporate the Duna legal entity form after July, and then we can do revenue share and drive app, like cash flows to app tokens. It's not totally a reach, right? That's definitely possible. And, you know, I think they list like six different things.
00:12:41.772 - 00:13:14.854, Speaker A: But, like, number four, if Dunas are nonprofits, can they engage in for profit activity? Yes, this would include the operation of a dex protocol. Interesting. And using, like, the Doona feature, a DAO could, for example, pay compensation to its members in exchange for participation in governance. So they're essentially saying that under the Doona, people that vote can receive compensation in the form of tokens, dollars, revenue, something. Right. Interesting, number five. So they kind of go over how we test.
00:13:14.854 - 00:13:47.530, Speaker A: And proponents of blockchain technology have long argued that none of these prongs is satisfied with respect to the vast majority of digital asset transactions. And most of these arguments against the Howey test would be maintained or could even be strengthened by a DAO adopting a Duna legal entity form. So they're saying with this entity form, the Howie test may not apply. Right. And it's compliant. And number eight, how does a 16 Z crypto plan to support the use of the do not? They essentially say we're going to support our portfolio companies in the US to adopt the do no legal entity form. Great.
00:13:47.530 - 00:14:19.202, Speaker A: So I thought it was interesting, right? Because in the February proposal, they said we proposed to upgrade protocol such that the fee rewards uni token holders that have delegated and staked their tokens. This may not have been compliant before July 1. After July 1, it could be compliant. So the fee switch could happen. That, I mean, that's how I read it. And last point number three is to create an app chain or NL two. So this like a uniswap chain, right? This has been talked about for a long time.
00:14:19.202 - 00:15:15.898, Speaker A: I think it makes sense on paper. I'm not sure how it'll work in practice. There's this paper by Dan Ellizer, the inevitability vnching, and he kind of goes over, I guess, like three ways to monetize for uniswap. Because right now, when you, I mean, when you swap on a dex, you pay a swap fee that goes to LP's or maybe the front end, there's a transaction fee, right? You pay gas, and then there's meV that goes to market makers or validators. Right now, uni holders can only flip a switch to take part of one, but no two and three. If you can create uni to be a staking token for a chain, then not only can you capture a potential swap fee, you can also capture the transaction fee and the mev, and it kind of becomes like a l one or l two token. So obviously it makes sense on paper, but also practically it means that all the liquidity has to migrate from mainnet to a different chain, which introduces some risks.
00:15:15.898 - 00:15:52.690, Speaker A: Also, if there's like a liquidation on Aave, right, like, how would that work? So I'm not sure. Right. But I mean, a 16 z in their article said that this is a viable path for value accrual. So I'm not going to dismiss this possibility that uniswap can potentially have a chain in the near term. But if you read into, you know, the lines between the Duna and I guess voting right, I think the second point is the most likely, but, you know, it remains to be seen. But this is a timeline which, you know, I think I, is interesting. February, the foundation and some VC's support the fee switch.
00:15:52.690 - 00:16:45.460, Speaker A: But may Andrews Norwitz stepped in to delay the vote. In July, Duna signed into law with the support of a 16 z. In August, they published an article on how to give revenue to token holders in a compliant way. So, like pausing here, I think, you know, if you just observe in the market and like uniswap and whatnot, I think, look, I'm just pulling this out of my ass, but I think the market thinks that the probability of a fee switch for uni this year is like 1% or something, right? I think that's what the market believes. I think the probability is actually much higher for all these reasons. And that alone, I think makes uni slightly mispriced. But anyways, you know, let's kind of go over the trade that I've talked about, which is buy the rumor.
00:16:45.460 - 00:17:11.678, Speaker A: I mean, which is basically what I'm doing, right? I have no idea what's going to happen, but I know v four is coming pretty soon. No one's paying attention to it. Let me buy the rumor and then determine whether I should sell the news or hold on to the news or just buy into the news. And by the way, if you're enjoying this content, make sure to check out the premium discord. I share my research in real time. I do three weekly premium videos every single week. You get access to a discord community or like a defi community.
00:17:11.678 - 00:17:41.120, Speaker A: I think, you know, I'm pretty good at like defi stuff. Or hopefully you think I'm kind of, kind of good, I hope. I mean, yeah, I never know, right? You know, but if you're interested, check out this below. I think it's going to be worth your while. But anyways, going up, going back to before, I think the market expectation is few switch impossible v four, lame nothing broker. Cool, right? I mean, even I kind of believe that. But the implication here is that it's already priced in, right? Everyone think.
00:17:41.120 - 00:18:30.390, Speaker A: If everyone thinks that there's going to be no fee switch, if everyone thinks that Univiv Four is going to be just nothing like a nothing burger, then what happens? If uni v four is a nothing burger, then maybe Uniswap goes up 2% that day because there's more attention. It's like, oh, before it launched, maybe some news traders come in, but what if there's something good that comes out of it? Everyone expects nothing. But if there's any positive news that comes out of e four, I just think there's significant upside to be had. And when I talk about this trade, I want you to understand that I'm not saying with certainty that there is going to be a fee switch. I'm just saying that downside is capped. And the upside is a lot. And the market is underappreciating this protocol upgrade for the most valuable defi protocol.
00:18:30.390 - 00:18:51.228, Speaker A: Everyone expects the worst, no one expects the best. Everyone's ignoring it. If everyone's ignoring it, no one owns it. If no one owns it, I want to buy in case there's good news. And if there's no good news, then, you know, maybe I don't lose any money. Right. Risk low, upside high.
00:18:51.228 - 00:19:16.804, Speaker A: Fantastic. Into the timeline with v four in February, they said they might push this in q three, but. So this is. I took this screenshot last week, but all the audits from all these auditing firms went live. Yeah, like Thursday, I believe. And the uniswap team said that they fixed all the things that they wanted to fix. So, you know, like, audits are finished.
00:19:16.804 - 00:19:33.666, Speaker A: There is one last audit that's happening right now. It's like a $2 million bug bounty. So if anyone finds like a. Like a critical error, right, or a bug, then they can be paid like a million dollars. And this ends October 1. So assuming that no one finds anything. Right.
00:19:33.666 - 00:20:10.978, Speaker A: And, you know, because they fixed everything. My hunch is October for V four, maybe November, but I think definitely Q four. So buying it before Q four, right. I am buying the rumor by definition, the features I'll talk about before I talk about like, you know, the trade in more detail. But maybe this is, like, not that interesting because this video focuses more on a 16 z and the potential fee switch. But I do think that talking about the futures is interesting. So one thing is that with V three, there's different contracts for every single pool.
00:20:10.978 - 00:20:43.238, Speaker A: So whenever, like, swaps are routed through them, it kind of costs more gas. But with V four, it's gonna be one single contract for everything, which reduces gas costs significantly. Cool story, ro. No one cares. Also with hooks, hooks are kind of interesting. So the way to think about it is with V four, uniswap is going to be the liquidity layer, and then it'll allow other developers to build plugins or apps on top of it. So maybe it can be like the Amazon or the Apple store of liquidity.
00:20:43.238 - 00:21:06.236, Speaker A: And example, hooks is, for example, you have to have a pudgy penguin to buy this token. NFT owners only. There can be KYC hooks. So you have to KYC to swap in and out of this pool. And there can be LBP curves. So basically, I think with all these things you can create ECA tools. It kind of makes some types of apps unnecessary.
00:21:06.236 - 00:21:39.992, Speaker A: So I think this is why I think Uniswap is going to continue to gain market share at the very least. Another thing that the foundation can do is they can, like, the foundation can build a hook with built in fees that they can use to monetize. Similar to how Jupiter, their aggregator on Solana, charges no fees. But if someone does a limit order or a DCA order, they can charge fees. So the uniswap foundation can definitely do that. So in a way, it kind of increases the surface level. Oh, sorry, the surface area to which, you know, they can monetize all the liquidity and volume that goes through their pools.
00:21:39.992 - 00:22:13.340, Speaker A: Other examples, you can set a limit order. So let's say you want to buy eth two k, and eth is above two k right now with limit, like, on chain limit orders that USDC sits idle. So you can create a hook that says buy eth at two k. But if it's above two k, just deposit that USDc on AaVE and earn like a 5% rate. Like 5% rate or something. I mean, yeah, that's kind of cool, right? Maybe that kind of boosts the overall velocity and activity on chain. You know, like coins not being utilized in the lp you can deposit into other apps.
00:22:13.340 - 00:22:43.336, Speaker A: I think the more potential fun things that we may not be considering are they can. I mean, someone can definitely create like a pumped up fun fork that pays some rent to uni. There can be like an ICO platform, like a liquidity bootstrapping pool that allows new tokens to launch on uniswap. So, you know, maybe there's like some puns and omic things that could happen here that I'm not even considering. But so far, you know, the. It's pretty basic. I just want to talk about features because, you know, I mean, unity before it does have features.
00:22:43.336 - 00:23:10.574, Speaker A: Right. I'm just more talking about the potential fee switch, which is like the main reason for this trade. Yeah, let's talk about this. So kind of visualizing the idea here is uniswap currently trading at like $6 or $0.60, right? 6,000,000,006.6 billion FDB. I think the max downside for uni, of course, I mean, you know, anything can happen, but, you know, it's bounced at four to $5 a couple times now.
00:23:10.574 - 00:24:03.568, Speaker A: And I don't really think we're going to revisit those levels. Maybe $5, but let's call that 20% to 30% downside. But what's the upside? The market has told us that when there's a fee switch. It literally went to $17, and when it first went to $17, I mean. I mean, that proposal didn't even pass, right? Like, at the point of the posting, no one knew if it was going to pass for sure, and it still went $17. So if this time around, like, over six months later, if a similar proposal comes into light, I think the probability of it passing is going to be close to 100%, given all the things I've found when it comes to a 16 z and the things that they've worked on. So my mentality is downside, like, maybe 20% to 30% upside, at least at three x to 17 and beyond.
00:24:03.568 - 00:24:51.366, Speaker A: I think reasonably, it can get to, like, 2025, $30 billion fdv, also on the ETH pair. So, you know, whenever I talk about defi coins, I always like to look at it on the ETH pair, because if I'm buying a random altcoin and it's underperforming ETH, which is also underperforming, like bitcoin and solana, then that's a nightmare. And I talked about Aave Eth before, but uni eth seems to be bouncing at these levels for the fifth time or the 6th time. So if there's a time for uni to bottom against eth v four, right. It would make sense. It would be obvious in hindsight. And generally, when it comes to trading and investing in crypto, you kind of want to buy reflexive assets where if it starts pumping, it's so obvious, right? It's like Aave, right? Or Solana.
00:24:51.366 - 00:25:20.380, Speaker A: Like, solana pumps, it's like, oh, my God, it was so obvious. Aave starts going up, it's like, oh, my God, so obvious. That's why I kind of like buying these fully vested, you know, fundamentally strong projects, because once they start moving, it becomes so obvious. And the mental block that people have is that, you know, there's. There's, like, no value accrual. But, like, if there's ever value accrual, then, like, what's the argument against these coins, right? There really is no strong argument. The biggest argument, right, is around value.
00:25:20.380 - 00:25:50.908, Speaker A: Cool. But I think that changes sometime soon. Clear category leader, they have 40% to 50% market share right now. I think that increases to 50, 60, 70% over time. Maybe 70%, like, 50% to 60% over time before with hooks introduces more avenues to monetize. And looking at the Gartner hype cycle, I think Innoswap is the next best candidate to start appreciating and putting higher highs and higher lows. Risk reward is good.
00:25:50.908 - 00:26:29.740, Speaker A: So from my perspective, I want to deploy capital, but a lot. At 650, I think my cost basis is a little bit higher, but like roughly 650. Right? Path of enlightenment. Cool. Do you believe in the DeFi renaissance yet? And from what I observed, people still don't believe in it, which is fair, right? I mean, you know, for me to claim that DeFi has bottomed is me essentially saying that the market is wrong. And typically, I don't want to be the guy to be like, oh, market is wrong. You know, it pays to be humble, have humility.
00:26:29.740 - 00:27:01.266, Speaker A: But I've done so much work on Defi coins recently, and I just think I'm like working so much harder than everyone else. So I just think I'm like early to this. And if I think I'm early to this, then I should just bet size. You know, bet size. And I saw this for my aave video as well. So if you check out this video on July 29, I literally said at the end, like, make fun of me all you want, but I believe in attack. I believe in the fundamentals.
00:27:01.266 - 00:27:20.502, Speaker A: And if there's anyone that can put in the bottom for defi coins, it has to be me, because no one else is putting in the work. Everyone has ignored it. I am the only one. Okay? So I'm putting my foot down. And if I am wrong, then I'm wrong. And you can make fun of me all you want. But if you go to this video and you look at the comment section, it's mostly just people making fun of me.
00:27:20.502 - 00:27:46.516, Speaker A: And I know that it's most like, you know, people just teasing me, right? It's like people trolling me and they don't really mean it. Or maybe they do mean it, I don't know. But you know, just check out the comment section for this video and then you can kind of get a gauge on the sentiment for defi coins. Everyone thinks they're dead. Let me take the other side. But lastly, I do want to wrap up the video by going over some counterarguments that you might be thinking of. Hopefully I've addressed most of them, but yeah, let me go over them.
00:27:46.516 - 00:28:21.604, Speaker A: So first is obviously the Uniswap or the wells notice against Uniswap and the SEC's, I guess, hostility against Uniswap. If you actually read the case, it's not a strong case. And the main argument against Uniswap, that the SEC is going after them for Coinbase already won the suitcase. So SEC is going after Uniswap the same way they did Coinbase. And then Coinbase essentially won that case. So technically, I mean, they don't really have a strong case. And I think all the negativity is priced into the token already.
00:28:21.604 - 00:29:04.050, Speaker A: Just ask some random crypto bro, like what they think of Uniswap. They will say it's a worthless governance token, the SEC is going after them. I don't want to buy, right? But if that's the sentiment, like no one owns Uniswap, right? Like everyone agrees, therefore it's priced in. And even earlier, like last week, I think the CFTC charged them like two hundred k, Uniswap, two hundred k for offering like certain types of securities and whatnot. And then Uniswap went down 3%. But like now it's trading higher, right? It's like everyone and their mothers know that the SEC is going after Uniswap. Don't you think it's already in the price, right? 2nd, 2nd counterargument is, I think this has the most validity.
00:29:04.050 - 00:29:39.310, Speaker A: Uniswap team and VC's, they want to pump the equity, they want to pump the Uniswap Labs equity and they don't care about the token. I mean, hopefully, I mean if you watch the video, I've kind of disproven this already. Like they literally tried to put value code for the tokenization, only the foundation, but also the VC's, VC's. Newsflash, they own a lot of uni. Newsflash team also owns a lot of uni, right? They get paid a USD salary with a uni bonus. They're all incentivized to drive value to the token at some point. And also like, let's, let's, let's be rational here.
00:29:39.310 - 00:30:28.750, Speaker A: Do people want value to accrue to an illiquid instrument or the liquid instrument? Right? I think they want token, I think they want value to accrue to the more liquid instrument. It's just that they haven't found a way to do it in a compliant way before. But I mean, hopefully I addressed all those concerns like a 16 z, right? The final boss essentially is saying, okay, like this is how we do it in a compliant way. So there is a way to do it in a compliant way. I don't know when, but it could happen this year. And I guess if you want to talk about incentives, uni foundation, they post these quarterly financials. I'm not sure if there's a strong point in favor of my argument, but they have $36 million in the treasury, and they have Runway until the end of 2025.
00:30:28.750 - 00:31:06.342, Speaker A: So, I mean, they have to make money somehow, right? And I think that's one of the reasons they posted this, because they want the foundation to be sustainable, and they don't want it to be like, the DAO sells tokens or they keep raising money in perpetuity to fund this thing. No, everyone wants to create a sustainable business. Also, this is more of a fun fact. But the Uniswap airdrop was four years ago. All the tokens are vested September 1, I think, of 2020 was the airdrop. We've come a long way. We have come a long way.
00:31:06.342 - 00:31:38.096, Speaker A: And if you check Etherscan for Uni, you see that basically 40% of the supply is in the treasury. So, like. And, like, they haven't sold it, right? Like, they're not going to sell it, right? They've been giving it out as grants. And there's also, like, this proposal. I mean, this was April 27, but they had this proposal to, like, mobilize the treasury. And the first point that they talked about was, hey, like, we, like, we owe, like, our treasury is all uniswap, like tokens. Like, we have to do something about this, right? We have to diversify.
00:31:38.096 - 00:32:25.362, Speaker A: We have to try value to give grants. So, no, I think Uniswap foundation and everyone involved understand that, you know, for it to be a profitable business or, like, a sustainable business, the token has to have some form of value accrual and a fee switch, maybe, where, like, maybe 20% of the fees go to the DAO, 80% go to token holders. That could make sense. It could make sense. And the last counter argument is defi coins zero under Kamala Harris. So, you know, I kind of see this narrative that, like, if Trump does not win, then Defi goes to zero, which I don't. I mean, I get where they're coming from, right? I am not denying that.
00:32:25.362 - 00:33:03.746, Speaker A: I mean, I agree that Trump is probably better for Defi than Kamala. Right? I agree. But for these coins to go to zero under a democratic president, it doesn't really make sense. I mean, we had a crazy bull market in 2021 under Biden. And also, I mean, this entire video, right, in February, they were about to turn on a fee switch, right? Because the argument for this is that as long as the Democrats are, like, as long as Kamala Harris is the president, they can never turn on a v switch. But that's factually incorrect because, I mean, hopefully, I'm not gonna like, you know, kick a dead horse. Like, you know, beat a dead horse.
00:33:03.746 - 00:34:03.388, Speaker A: But I mean, just look at the facts. Like, maker turned on the P switch last year, maybe because they're not based in the US, right? Same for Ave. Yeah, that's a strong argument, right? But like, some of these Defi tokens, they're about to turn on the free switch and do value cruel, right? And a 16 z, like. And also, if DeFi requires a particular president to be in office, or just crypto in general, then the industry is fucked anyways, right? Maybe this is a hot take, but I think crypto goes up no matter who's in office. So I hope you enjoyed the content. And I think we are in the midst of a Defi renaissance where a lot of the blue chips, the tokens that have gone down 80%, been trading sideways for a few years, have run out of sellers. I think the holder base is just diamond handed.
00:34:03.388 - 00:34:39.870, Speaker A: And I think the fundamentals are improving for some of these category leaders such as Aave and Uniswap, where they can start to appreciate and really surprise people. If everyone thinks Uniswap or Aave is dead, then no one owns them. So who is there left to sell? If the narrative shifts towards defi, then by definition more people have to buy back, in which I think increases the risk reward for these types of trades.
