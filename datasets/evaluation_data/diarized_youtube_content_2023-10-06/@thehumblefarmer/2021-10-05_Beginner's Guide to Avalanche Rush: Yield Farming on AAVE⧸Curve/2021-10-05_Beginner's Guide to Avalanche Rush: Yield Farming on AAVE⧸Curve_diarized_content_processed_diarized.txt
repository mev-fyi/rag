00:00:00.280 - 00:00:29.014, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here. And in this video I'll be going over how to yield farm on avalanche blockchain with bitcoin eat and or stablecoins. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so for people that's trying to get into yield farming for the first time, or just kind of want to know like what is farming and how it works, let me just kind of explain it to you in the most simplest way possible as it relates to avalanche. So avalanche is a relatively new l one that's opened its doors to the community.
00:00:29.014 - 00:01:15.100, Speaker A: And, you know, a couple months ago there was like no one really using, right. So to essentially incentivize people to bridge their funds over from ethereum or centralized exchanges to the avalanche blockchain, they're like, you know what, guys? Like, we're open for business. If you want to come over, we will literally give you free tokens. That's essentially how farming works. Whether it's like protocols that's like giving you free tokens or the Avalanche foundation giving you like Avax tokens. If you're early into these protocols, these ecosystems, and you're able to like form these tokens for free, you can either sell them later at a profit or you can like just farm to accumulate them in order to sell it for higher prices later. And the most notable yield farming program or the Defi incentive program is avalanche rush.
00:01:15.100 - 00:01:45.560, Speaker A: This was like, at the time of announcement, it was a $180 million program, but they actually allocated 10 million avalanche tokens, right? So at the current prices, which is like roughly 60, $65, it's roughly a $600 million program. So obviously these rewards are going to hit all at once. They're going to scale it, they're going to phase it out over time slowly so people don't lose excitement over their ecosystem, whatnot. However, it's live. The easy rewards are live. It's coming. And if you're a farmer, then avalanche is a good place to be.
00:01:45.560 - 00:02:24.254, Speaker A: One of the reasons why I was so bullish at avalanche two months ago was because Aave was announced and Ave was going to be here. And now Ave is actually here. There's a typo. But my favorite application, all of DeFi is Aave. It's finally deployed an avalanche with liquidity money incentives. So let's just go over like, what is Aave? And why is it so important for these ecosystems to have AAve in these l one s? Because Aave is a money market, right? It's a lending and borrowing protocol. When it comes to lending and borrowing in traditional finance, you know, a bank will, you essentially deposit your money at a bank, and the bank will lend it out to borrowers, and they'll charge an interest, and the bank will generously give you, like, 0.01%
00:02:24.254 - 00:03:05.306, Speaker A: interest rate in exchange for your hard earned dollars, right? But, you know, crypto and decentralized finance says, like, what if we just get rid of the bank, right, and just replace it with Aave or a protocol in the middle. That way we get rid of the bank, which takes, you know, money to pay their CEO's, their employees, you know, salaries and bonuses. And it kind of, like, by getting rid of the metal man, it kind of both the borrower and the lender benefit. And you don't have to ask for permission, right? If you want to, like, lend out money, you can just do it whenever you're going to borrow money, you can do it whenever. So it's obvious it was a lending and borrowing protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. But they're a multi chain protocol, right? They're not like Ethereum Maxis. They believe that the future is multi chain, which is my bias.
00:03:05.306 - 00:03:58.118, Speaker A: And Aave removes the middleman with smart contracts, allowing anyone to be their own bank. Okay, so. And $20 million worth of Avax is going to be allocated for Aave, which means that you're going to be paid to borrow and lend on Aave, right? And traditionally, like, you can only make money when you're lending out money, right? But like, with these liquidity mining incentive programs, you can actually make money from borrowing, which is an all concept. So I took the screenshot earlier today, right? So on the left side, you see all the assets that Alfie has. And on the red box, you see whatever deposit APIs you would earn. So, for example, let's look at USDC, right? Like you, if you deposit USDC, you earn 2% paid in USDC, but below that, you see 2.55% APR, right? So this is paid in the avalanche token, right? So avalanche Ava labs is like here, like, if you use Aave, we'll give you tokens, right? Just free tokens.
00:03:58.118 - 00:04:13.102, Speaker A: And the other side, you see on the. On the red box, the borrow apy. So let's focus on USDC again. So right now you're paying 3.3% to the lenders to borrow dollars. However, avalanche is paying you 3.9% roughly in avalanche tokens.
00:04:13.102 - 00:04:33.547, Speaker A: Essentially, you're being paid to borrow. Right. You're not being paid a ridiculous amount, but, you know, it's essentially a free loan. Essentially. So that's Aave, let's just go over curve. Right? So curve is the other decentralized application that's getting avalanche rewards for avalanche rush. So curve is a decentralized exchange that specializes in like, asset swaps.
00:04:33.547 - 00:04:58.792, Speaker A: So from USDC to dai dai to tether wrap, bitcoin to ram, bitcoin, etcetera. Right. It's really, really capital efficient. And you can deposit assets to earn avalanche rewards as well as earn, earn swap fees from the protocol. So this is the screenshot I took earlier today. As you can see right here, this obvious pool is essentially a stable pool, right? So if you stay, if you deposit stable coins, you can earn right now, 70%. Right.
00:04:58.792 - 00:05:38.880, Speaker A: This is not going to sustain itself because, you know, I mean, these rates are insane, right? So more people are going to pilot, but at the time it's roughly 70%. I expect this to stabilize stabilizer like roughly 30% to 40% in the near future. And over time, it's going to go down because, yeah, more people are going to go in and the h five crypto pool is paying 250% in Avax. I'm not going to go over this in this video because I have a video on it. I'll provide a to this in the description below. But you can deposit bitcoin, either stable coins and earn like 250%, which is pretty good. But I'm not going to focus on this pool just for the sake of, for the sake of the video, I'll be focusing more on the stable pool, which is like paying 70% roughly.
00:05:38.880 - 00:05:49.092, Speaker A: Yeah. So I took the liberty to just look at all these rates. Right. The obvious paying. Right. And just take getting the net Apy. Right.
00:05:49.092 - 00:06:33.850, Speaker A: So on the deposit side, you just add up these two numbers, right, because you're being paid on both sides. But on the borrower side, you take the avalanche rewards and deduct whatever interest rate you're paying to get the net APY. So then the net lending APY is roughly this, where avalanche, 10%, bitcoin, 5%, et cetera, et cetera, and curve. Just because those 70% rates are not sustainable, I'm just going to assume and be conservative and say, you know what, like maybe a week from now we're going to be paid 40% to do so. Obviously right now you can be paid a lot more, but obviously these rates are not going to sustain itself forever. And on the borrow side, it's roughly here right. Right now, I mean, these rates fluctuate a lot, so it's hard to take this at bank, no pun intended, but you can be paid to borrow bitcoin, eat, or stable coins, which is pretty nice.
00:06:33.850 - 00:07:35.860, Speaker A: So for the sake of this video, I'm just going to assume that we're going to deposit bitcoin just because I think, I mean, everyone, I feel like everyone holds bitcoin, and it's one of the better assets to use as collateral, at least in my opinion. So for this video, I'm just gonna say, you know what? I'm gonna deposit $10,000 roughly into Aave and borrow $5,000 with a tether, right? And I'm being paid to do so on both sides. And you might be asking, like, is this safe? Like, I'm borrowing $5,000. Like, how do you know this is safe? Well, the easiest way to understand, like, how safe is this position? I mean, you can look at the health factor, but it doesn't really mean much. If you click on the details tab here, it'll show you the liquidation threshold. This is the most important, right? So this means that, like, what? Like, what is the loan to value? Like, so at 75%, if your loan to value is 75%, your position is. Might get liquidated, right? So if I'm borrowing $5,000 and the $5,000 is 75% of whatever my collateral is, then my position is at risk of being liquidated.
00:07:35.860 - 00:08:37.422, Speaker A: So the simplest math you can do is now take $5,000 and divide it by 0.75, right? So essentially this means that if my, if my collateral gets down to this figure, my position is susceptible to being liquidated, right? So because I have $10,000 deposited into this position, essentially my collateral would have to dip 33% in order for me to get liquidated. Yeah. So. And also, like, it kind of has to happen overnight, right? Because, like, if bitcoin's down, like, 20% tomorrow, am I just going to look at my position and be like, oh, I hope I don't get liquidated? No, like, I'm going to pay back my loan because, I mean, that's what you should do, right? You can't just, like, look, look at your, like, your collateral just go down and, like, not do anything about it, right? So I find this extremely unlikely for bitcoin to dump 33%, like, overnight, right? So, you know, I mean, obviously do your own research, not financial advice, but I'm just going to use this figure as an assumption, as a base case. For all of my examples and different strategies that you can do on Aave, right here, actually. So I have five different strategies.
00:08:37.422 - 00:09:05.920, Speaker A: I mean, you can name this whatever you want. I just. I mean, it took, like, 30 seconds to come up with these, so it's not like that complex. But I'm going to go over this one by one, and it might go over your head the first time you watch this video. So you might have to rewatch this video a few times. But, you know, I'm just going to go over a couple strategies you can use on Aave, because Aave isn't just a money market, right? You don't just borrow land because you're being paid to borrow. You can do many, many things with Aave, which I'll go over.
00:09:05.920 - 00:09:26.562, Speaker A: So the simplest strategy, right, is you deposit bitcoin, you borrow dollars, right? Which I've done. And you deposit into curve. So you're earning 5% on bitcoin. You're being. You're earning 1.5% on stable coins and you're earning 40% on those stable coins. So you have $10,000 of bitcoin earning 5% and $5,000 of tether earning 41.5%.
00:09:26.562 - 00:09:54.846, Speaker A: Right? Does that make sense? I hope it does. So if you do the math, your initial 10,000 in bitcoin is yielding roughly 25.75% in annual yield. I think I did the math correctly here, right? Does that make sense? You deposit bitcoin, earn 5%, you borrow dollars, earn 1.5%, take those dollars, put it into curve and earn 40% on that, right? And if you do the math, it's roughly 26% apyethere. Pretty sick, pretty nuts. Strategy number two, a delta neutral form of strategy.
00:09:54.846 - 00:10:28.422, Speaker A: I put. I put it in quotes because it's not actually delta neutral, but it kind of is, in a sense. Let me just kind of go over it. So what you would do is you deposit bitcoin, right, as collateral, you borrow bitcoin, right? And then you sell the borrowed bitcoin and deposit those stable coins in the curve, if that makes sense. So essentially what you're doing is, you know, taking bitcoin, borrowing bitcoin, and putting, like, the dollars into curve, which is here, right? 10,000 bitcoin, earning 5%. You borrow $5,000 worth of bitcoin, earning 1%. You sell that and those dollars you deposit into curve, earning 40%.
00:10:28.422 - 00:10:44.492, Speaker A: So the APIs. Sorry, I'm a hypo. It's 25.5%, but your initial 10,000 in bitcoin is yielding 25.5% APY. And you don't really have liquidation risk because you. Your collateral is bitcoin and you're borrowing bitcoin, so.
00:10:44.492 - 00:10:59.892, Speaker A: Right. So even if it goes up, like, you're never going to get liquidated. Right. Or go down. So it's kind of like a delta neutral strategy where you start with $10,000 in bitcoin, but your net $5,000 in bitcoin exposure. Right. Because your collateral is $10,000, you borrow $5,000.
00:10:59.892 - 00:11:22.458, Speaker A: So your net exposure to bitcoin is $5,000, and you're earning 25.5% while doing so. Okay, let's move on to the next one. Yeah, sorry. If this is going over your head, just rewatch this video, kind of think about it, and kind of conceptualize, like, what's actually going on here. Third option is the safe leverage farm strategy. It's not like actually leverage, but, you know, I just couldn't think of, like, a better way to think about it.
00:11:22.458 - 00:11:53.934, Speaker A: But you essentially deposit bitcoin, borrow bitcoin against it, and redeposit bitcoin into Aave. So essentially, you just kind of do this loop. You can kind of do this loop as many times as you want, but because you're borrowing and lending the same asset, there essentially is zero liquidation risk in most circumstances. So 10,000 in bitcoin earning 5%, you borrow bitcoin, earn 1%, redeposit that into. Into Aave, earn 5% on that. Right. So your initial $10,000 in bitcoin is yielding $800 in annual yield, roughly 8% without liquidation risk.
00:11:53.934 - 00:12:16.068, Speaker A: So at the end of it, you're going to have $15,000. Right, of bitcoin on the lending side and $5,000 of bitcoin on the borrowing side. Right. Because you borrow five k and you redeposit it. So you're essentially like, your position hasn't changed, right. You just kind of just, like, looping your position over and over. And, you know, I've only done this once, but you can probably, like, get this, like, to 10% or something if you keep.
00:12:16.068 - 00:12:45.816, Speaker A: If you keep looping it over and over again, the next strategy, and this is the strategy I deployed on avalanche, right? So two months ago, I was super bullish avalanche. So I have avalanche as collateral, borrowed dollars against it, bought avalanche with those dollars, and redeposit those avalanche into my position. And, you know, I don't. You have to do your own research, right? Because I don't really recommend, like leverage, like, like, like doing like leverage trading on this channel. Right. I mean, this is a farming channel. Like, I don't really use leverage.
00:12:45.816 - 00:13:05.192, Speaker A: Uh, but, you know, I'm just going over some things you can do with Aave. Uh, because, you know, like, what is leverage? Like, what does it mean to leverage long? Right. You borrow. You borrow money to like increase your exposure. That's kind of like what's going on here. Right here. So, yeah, you have $10,000 bitcoin as collateral.
00:13:05.192 - 00:13:33.050, Speaker A: You borrow $5,000, which is you're being paid 1.5% to do so. And, you know, just use those funds to buy bitcoin and redeposit the $5,000 back into Aave earning 5%. So essentially you have like a 1.5 x leveraged position, right. So always doing research and, you know, just going over some things you can do and you're being paid leverage long, which in some circumstances it's like really good, right. So if you really have conviction and, you know, you can manage your risk if you're.
00:13:33.050 - 00:14:01.010, Speaker A: If you're doing this for the first time, I don't recommend it, but no, for me, I'm really experienced. I've done this for a long time now. So when I think an asset is going to appreciate, I sometimes do this to increase my position. And if I'm being paid to do so, then it's all the more the merrier. Okay, so the last strategy, it's not really a strategy, right. But it's kind of like a concept that isn't really thought about amongst the crypto community. And it's essentially being paid to bridge, right.
00:14:01.010 - 00:14:26.968, Speaker A: Because when it comes to me, like, I talk about a bunch of ecosystems, but I'm not an ecosystem, Max. Right. In Q two, I was forming my eyes out on polygon because I knew that the polygon ecosystem would do really, really well. And in July, I started farming in the terro ecosystem, the terra luna ecosystem, because I knew that ecosystem would do well. And in August I started farming in the avalanche ecosystem because I knew that ecosystem would do well. Right. I'm not married to any of these ecosystems.
00:14:26.968 - 00:15:16.462, Speaker A: In fact, the only thing I'm married to is making money and the yield. Right? I'm a yield maximalist, if that makes any sense. So, you know, like, just because you know, these opportunities are available in avalanche doesn't mean that you should ignore other ecosystems, right? In fact, like, I've already started like phasing out my avalanche positions and rotating it into other ecosystems, like phantom. But I'm not gonna go over it in the video. But, you know, if you have bitcoin, right, and you don't want to sell that bitcoin, but you kind of want to farm on other ecosystems, you can, you know, just borrow dollars, bridge, you know, to other ecosystems and be paid to do so, right? And, yeah, it's a simple concept, right? Like, you don't want to sell your bitcoin, but you want to, you know, you want some, like, money liquid, so you can borrow a safe amount, be paid 1.5% on your dollars, and bridge it elsewhere. So hopefully that makes sense.
00:15:16.462 - 00:16:09.758, Speaker A: So, at the end of the end of the day, I can't speak at the end of the day, you know, money markets allow you to manage your portfolio in a whole new way. And if you go through my channel, I like my. Like, my trading, I guess, like, my farming strategy isn't that complicated, right? Ever since April, all I've done is, I, like, allocate money to where aave goes, right? And I've made a lot of money doing so, I think, in the past six months, I think the markets are more efficient, because when I first started doing this, like, no one knew about this, but I think through Aave, through polygon, through terra, through Terra, and through avalanche, and through other ecosystems, I think the market is starting to understand, okay? Whenever Aave goes into these ecosystems, it's bullish. So, this used to be my alpha. It's not really my alpha anymore. I have other alpha, you know, but, you know, it's. And it's, like, kind of like the humble farmer thesis that I've created in July.
00:16:09.758 - 00:16:40.756, Speaker A: Use this to go where the money market goes, because, as you saw, like, money markets allow you to do so many, many things, right? You can be paid to leverage long. You can be paid to shorten asset. You can be paid to earn more yield on your bitcoin, right? Like, strategy one. Like, I'm earning 26% on my bitcoin. Like, we're gonna do that, right, in centralized finance. So there does come with risk. But I only covered Aave and curve here, right? Because, I mean, when it comes to blue chip protocols, like, the safe protocols, you know, Aave, you know, they have the highest tpO, total value locked in all of Defi.
00:16:40.756 - 00:17:04.500, Speaker A: And curve is also considered to be a blue chip. So, you know, they're obviously, the more risk you take, the higher that your rates are. But, I mean, that's how the world works, right? Like, if you want higher returns, you have to take on more risk. If you want low risk, then you're gonna just get met with lower returns. So, you know, this is the reason I'm super bullish, Aave. Super bullish. I guess I'm not bullish to aave token, but I'm bullish the protocol, if that makes sense.
00:17:04.500 - 00:17:53.126, Speaker A: So hopefully this is a good video trying to give you. Trying to shed light on why Aave is an amazing protocol and why yield farming is such a profitable way to manage your portfolio and to hedge risk in all sorts of ways too. And then tomorrow, now that finally live, I've been working on this free yield farming guide for a month now, essentially. But, you know, just. I'm gonna release this YoL farming guide, right? So if you did it new to farming or you have a friend that wants to get in, I kind of go over, like, what is yield farming? Here are a bunch of tools. How do you pick an ecosystem, right? Like, maybe you start with polygon because the fees are lower and yeah, it's tightly approved. And, you know, like, once you're more comfortable, maybe you expand to that landscape ecosystem.
00:17:53.126 - 00:18:25.902, Speaker A: Because though the avalanche ecosystem has better rates, the transaction fees are more expensive. So if you only want to, like, put in a few hundred dollars, then avalanche is not the place for you, right? Just. Just being honest. So, you know, defi. The fees are expensive, but there's no way around that. But, you know, the opportunities are much better, right? So kind of go over different strategies like how. How should you think about farming and dumping versus, like, farming to accumulate, right? So depending on the protocol, like most, like most farms, I just farming them to token, right? Because the tokens are worthless.
00:18:25.902 - 00:18:53.990, Speaker A: But sometimes I farm to accumulate because it makes sense. Kind of go over key terms and some memes here, right? To most people, it's dear to the farmer's potential. So hopefully this gives, yeah. A better insight on what is yield farming. And, you know, what can you do with Aave? Because I employ those strategies all the time. In fact, like, right now, what I'm doing is like, what is it? Yeah, I'm actually, like, using my collateral, borrowing dollars. And like, I bridged it over to Phantom.
00:18:53.990 - 00:19:24.056, Speaker A: So, you know, stuff like that you can do. And, you know, it's like, I'm gonna have to repay those loans at some point, right? But if I'm being paid to do so, then, like, I'm in no significant rush. So thank you guys for watching. Hope this video was useful. If it was, please give me a like and subscribe leave a comment in the comment section below. If you want to know how I'm farming and navigating the markets right this multi chain farming ecosystem, then I have a paid discord where private discord in the description below where I'm fully transparent with what I'm doing. So thank you guys for watching.
00:19:24.056 - 00:19:26.720, Speaker A: Have a good one and have fun farming out there. Bye.
