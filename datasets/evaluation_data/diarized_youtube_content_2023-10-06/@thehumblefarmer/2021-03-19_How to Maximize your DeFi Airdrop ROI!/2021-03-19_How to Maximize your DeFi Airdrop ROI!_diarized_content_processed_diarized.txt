00:00:00.600 - 00:00:01.846, Speaker A: What's up, guys? Tyke here.
00:00:01.878 - 00:00:03.246, Speaker B: And in this video, I'll be going.
00:00:03.278 - 00:00:05.766, Speaker A: Over how you can find the next big defi airdrop.
00:00:05.838 - 00:00:07.182, Speaker B: If you like the content, please like.
00:00:07.206 - 00:00:20.606, Speaker A: And subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Let's get started. First of all, what are airdrops? Airdrops are when DeFi protocols reward early users by just distributing tokens to them. And the idea is that by airdropping.
00:00:20.638 - 00:00:22.518, Speaker B: Tokens to you, it'll bootstrap growth of.
00:00:22.534 - 00:00:31.418, Speaker A: The protocol by incentivizing usage. And also the protocol will receive free marketing because the users will, you know, talk about, oh my God, I got a free airdrop, yada, yada, yada.
00:00:31.554 - 00:00:34.578, Speaker B: And most of these airdrops are gonna be governance tokens.
00:00:34.714 - 00:00:46.834, Speaker A: And, you know, protocols want to basically give out governance tokens to early users because these early users are gonna be the ones that are, that will be voting in governance and therefore increasing the value of the protocol in the future.
00:00:46.962 - 00:00:49.670, Speaker B: And therefore accruing value to the token.
00:00:50.130 - 00:00:58.810, Speaker A: The way I think about airdrops is I make a connection to how Facebook might have used their drops, if that was a thing, right? Hypothetically, if you think about it, Facebook.
00:00:59.350 - 00:01:02.902, Speaker B: Their value comes from network effects. If no one's using the platform, Facebook.
00:01:02.966 - 00:01:10.170, Speaker A: Has no value because there's no one to run the ads for. So hypothetically, you know, if you're mark ex and you want to grow Facebook.
00:01:10.550 - 00:01:12.942, Speaker B: He could have considered basically giving Facebook.
00:01:13.006 - 00:01:34.466, Speaker A: Stock to maybe the first 10,000 users of Facebook. And the idea is that, you know, these early users, Facebook, you know, they're going to show Facebook to all their friends, they're going to share it, they're going to give links like all that. Because these early users, they want Facebook to grow, right? Because if Facebook grows and becomes big like it is now, they're going to be rich.
00:01:34.578 - 00:01:36.058, Speaker B: Obviously, this does not happen in the.
00:01:36.074 - 00:01:55.322, Speaker A: Real world, but this is the way crypto projects are thinking about airdropping tokens. And we've seen how these airdrops can be worth a lot of money. With uniswap, the 2020 airdrop is not worth twelve k. Being early in using these protocols, you can be really handsomely rewarded.
00:01:55.426 - 00:01:56.866, Speaker B: And the thing with this airdrop was.
00:01:56.898 - 00:02:16.572, Speaker A: That these airdrops were given to each wallet address that used the protocol. So if you had three wallet addresses as an individual, and you used uniswap in all three of them, you could have received $36,000 uniswap tokens. With that being said, now that you have a better understanding of what airdrops are.
00:02:16.666 - 00:02:18.680, Speaker B: Here's my game plan of how I'm.
00:02:18.720 - 00:02:29.272, Speaker A: Approaching 2021 and how to try to maximize my chances of getting airdrops. So first, I've already created three wallets on metamask that I'll be using the.
00:02:29.296 - 00:02:31.816, Speaker B: Protocols for, and I've already identified some.
00:02:31.848 - 00:02:49.680, Speaker A: Projects that could have airdrops. Chances are, if there's a project in DeFi that does not have a token yet, odds are they're gonna have a token in the future, I'm gonna use all these protocols with as much wallets as I can and just wait and hope, right? I mean, this is like the way to do it.
00:02:49.840 - 00:02:53.520, Speaker B: Nothing is guaranteed. It's not guaranteed that some random app.
00:02:53.600 - 00:02:55.088, Speaker A: Is gonna have a token in the future.
00:02:55.224 - 00:02:57.288, Speaker B: But by having creating as many wallets.
00:02:57.304 - 00:03:08.904, Speaker A: As you can, and is using as many wallet as using as many protocols as you can, you can increase your chances of getting substantial amounts of money for your airdrops. So before I get into the projects.
00:03:08.952 - 00:03:10.948, Speaker B: I'm looking at quick reminder that none.
00:03:10.964 - 00:03:12.260, Speaker A: Of this is financial advice.
00:03:12.380 - 00:03:15.068, Speaker B: There's always smart contract risk and always.
00:03:15.124 - 00:03:16.800, Speaker A: Do your own research. So.
00:03:18.500 - 00:03:19.972, Speaker B: These are the projects in blue.
00:03:20.036 - 00:03:44.050, Speaker A: That I've already used with two of my wallets. So if any of these wallets, so sorry. If any of these projects decide to do an airdrop, hopefully I qualify for them and receive it. And here are the other projects that I'm looking at that I'll try to use in the future. I haven't used them yet because I have to pay gas. Maybe I'll use them when the gas is lower. But these are the projects I'm looking at, and there's gonna be many more in the future.
00:03:44.050 - 00:03:50.602, Speaker A: There are so many new DeFi projects released per day, and chances are a month from now, some of these might.
00:03:50.626 - 00:03:57.090, Speaker B: Have already airdropped and etcetera. And I got this from this Reddit thread that I'll post in the link.
00:03:57.210 - 00:04:04.380, Speaker A: Post a link to in the description below. And I refresh this like once a week to see if if he's updated with any projects.
00:04:06.000 - 00:04:07.768, Speaker B: And the cool thing about airdrops is.
00:04:07.784 - 00:04:17.768, Speaker A: That protocols are adapting, right? They're not just now rewarding tokens to early adopters. Some projects are rewarding good actors in.
00:04:17.784 - 00:04:19.032, Speaker B: The space with airdrops.
00:04:19.056 - 00:04:25.472, Speaker A: So for example, Yuma recently airdropped tokens to people that have participated in governance.
00:04:25.536 - 00:04:29.286, Speaker B: For other projects like Badger, Dao, Balancer, Sushiswap, etcetera.
00:04:29.398 - 00:04:46.166, Speaker A: And the idea is that, you know, Yuma is basically saying, you know, if you're a Defi user that cares about Defi, that cares enough about DeFi to participate in governance for these other projects. You know, you're the type of person that we want in our community. Here are some tokens. Please be a part of us.
00:04:46.238 - 00:04:46.542, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:46.606 - 00:04:57.160, Speaker A: Makes sense. And I think a lot of projects go this way in the future. And also Badger did basically distributed tokens to people that have donated to Gitcoin.
00:04:57.280 - 00:04:58.792, Speaker B: For those that don't know, Gitcoin is.
00:04:58.816 - 00:05:30.848, Speaker A: Like a Kickstarter, an Indiegogo type where people can donate money to early contributors in the space and to like random projects that they want to see play out. And Badger is saying, you know what? Like if you're a type of person that's donating money to like contributors and projects, like, we really want you to be part of our community and help Badgroup grow and become a stronger project in the future. So what are the takeaways? Just use DeFi protocols and learn about the space. We're still really, really early and you could be handsomely rewarded.
00:05:31.024 - 00:05:32.528, Speaker B: Also, this is something that I'm trying.
00:05:32.544 - 00:05:39.688, Speaker A: To get better at, but let's try to participate in governance. What we seen, what we saw at Yuma, I think will happen a lot.
00:05:39.704 - 00:05:40.544, Speaker B: More in the future.
00:05:40.672 - 00:05:46.688, Speaker A: So if you're following a project and you want to see the project grow and want your tokens to go up.
00:05:46.744 - 00:05:49.104, Speaker B: Participate in governance, and maybe another project.
00:05:49.232 - 00:05:53.246, Speaker A: Will give you an airdrop because they see that you're a good actor in the space.
00:05:53.438 - 00:05:55.142, Speaker B: And if you're lucky, maybe you can.
00:05:55.166 - 00:05:58.998, Speaker A: Get a crazy airdrop like what we saw with uniswap.
