00:00:00.400 - 00:00:43.216, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here and welcome to Farms of the week, where I'll be going over the farms I'm currently in as well as the farms I'm watching. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so I think we can label this week avalanche Rush week because on the 23rd, Ava Labs announced that avian Curve is coming next week, which is this week. When is it coming? Who knows? Right? I suspect maybe the 29th or the 30th because on the 29th there's going to be a Twitter spaces event with Stani, the founder of Aave Zero, Xmorlock, the founder of Trader Joe, as well as three other Avalanche team members to discuss maximizing your defi with avalanche Rush. So, you know, either they're going to launch this on the 29th and they're going to be talking about bullish things, or they're going to be like, yeah, it's coming tomorrow on the 30th, so let's talk about all the things you can do.
00:00:43.216 - 00:01:34.374, Speaker A: So I suspect end of the month, ideally not October 1, but it is what it is. So for those that have never experienced this before, like, what should you expect? Right? Because if you, if you've been following me since the Polygon days, like, you know what's about to go down, right? What's about to go down is the money playing game. And I guess if you, if avalanche was your first defi play, you might not really know what to expect. So the best comparison I can make is with Polygon Aave. In fact, it's like a perfect comparison because Polygon announced a 40 million, $40 million liquidity money program. But in actuality, if you zoom in, this is spread out in two phases, right? 20 million for three months from April 14 to June 14, and 20 million from June 14 to April 20, 2022. And if you look at the avalanche rush with Aave, it's essentially $20 million over a three month period.
00:01:34.374 - 00:02:04.080, Speaker A: So it's the same exact thing. So you can expect the same exact thing to happen, like what happened on Polygon to happen on avalanche. So if you flash back to my older videos, when I had no hair and I was using light mode on Aave, I was a complete defined noob. You can kind of zoom in on what was actually possible. Let's actually zoom in here. You can see that you can essentially deposit any asset here and be paid essentially 10%. You can expect to earn at least roughly 10% on bitcoin eth avalanche, stablecoins, et cetera.
00:02:04.080 - 00:02:40.734, Speaker A: And when you borrow assets, you can essentially pay 4% interest rate to borrow tether, but you'll be paid, let's say, I think 16% is going to be too high. I think it'll be lower. But essentially you'll be paid to borrow. Like, you're just gonna be like making free money, essentially, right? And this is why liquidity money incentives are so powerful, because these foundations, they're like, okay, if you bridge over to our blockchain, we're gonna pay you money. Right? So that's why I like to play, play these l one rotation games. Like, if these foundations are gonna give you money, why not take them? So this is Aave, super, super bullish and on curve. As you can see, I have a farmer hat on.
00:02:40.734 - 00:03:04.540, Speaker A: But you know, this was very, very, very early on where I was being paid 10% in dollars and 38% in matic tokens on Kerr. I. So I don't think it'll be this high. I think it'll be 20% to 30% on dollars, maybe ten to 20% on bitcoin. But you can expect that, hey, a lot of people are going to be bridging over. Speaking of bridging over, let's look at the bridging data. I think this is the most important metric to look at in order to assess the health of the ecosystem.
00:03:04.540 - 00:03:40.756, Speaker A: And if you want any more proof that the institutions are here, let's look at this, right? Because on Thursday and Friday, we had this giga candles where we had a couple whales. This deposit half a billion dollars on Thursday, and let's say $400 million on Friday and on the weekend. No one is like, no one like really bridged. So I suspect these to be funds. In actuality, if you look at this, you can track some whales on zapper, which is like a wallet tracking platform. I'm not going to dox their address, because if I was a fund or a whale with $1.2 billion, I wouldn't mind, or I would not want some random youtuber just doxing my wallet everywhere.
00:03:40.756 - 00:04:09.096, Speaker A: But I'll just give a brief overview of what this person is doing or this fund, who knows? Essentially, this person is just like farming a bunch on Benki. This person has $700 million in Benki. They've been borrowing some dollars, and I think they're redepositing back into the lending side. And they have a bunch of key tokens, bunch of apex tokens that they've been farming also. They're also farming a bunch of trader Joe tokens. They don't really have exposure to the Joe token. They're just like, farming with evacs.
00:04:09.096 - 00:04:21.768, Speaker A: Stablecoins. Stablecoins. Link, Ethan. You know, a bunch of bitcoin eat eth avax. And they have roughly. I don't even know. I'm not gonna count this right now, but, like, maybe like half a million dollars with the geo tokens, you can assume.
00:04:21.768 - 00:04:50.872, Speaker A: I mean, are they gonna sell this? Who knows? I'm not, like, in this fund or whatever. Like, I don't know this person. But, you know, this is always the risk of, like, buying these farm tokens because who knows what this person is gonna do? Also, I have a suspicion that this wallet address is Alameda. Who knows, right? I'm not gonna. I mean, I guess you can look this up, but I'm not gonna completely dox their wallet address. But they're also farming a bunch on avalanche. You see, you know, they're also on convex, but, you know, they're essentially farming on Venki.
00:04:50.872 - 00:05:10.270, Speaker A: Let's look at how much tokens have they been farming? They have a bunch. I mean, they were farming a lot. I'm sure they were in this, but they wish drew some just to prepare for Aave. And on Trader Joe, they have like 700. They almost have, I think, $800,000 of Joe tokens. This is not, I'm not trying to fudge you. I think they're a really good app.
00:05:10.270 - 00:05:41.840, Speaker A: In fact, I'll talk more bullish things after this segment. But this is the risk of buying these farm tokens because who knows what Alameda is going to do? Okay, I don't even know if this is Alameda. Someone told me that this is Alameda, but there's no actual way to tell. So speaking of Trader Joe, I mean, I still think Trader Joe is one of the best farms on avalanche just because you can earn, you know, pretty decent yields on liquidity pairs like Avax USDT. Right? We also saw all these whales do avax pairs. You can do Avax eth too, or. Well, you get the point.
00:05:41.840 - 00:06:14.678, Speaker A: There's going to be a bunch of good farms on avalanche. You can auto compound it on Yodiak or other auto compounders, but, you know, you can earn 35% on bitcoin USDT, 32% on ETH USDT, and if you use an auto compounder, this can probably get to like 40% to 50%. So, I mean, these are really, really good forms. So speaking of Trader Joe, in terms of bullish catalysts, banker Joe is launching October 4. I believe they're going to be receiving avalanche rush rewards. I don't know how much. Goldiac only got $100,000 in rewards, so I don't think they're going to, I don't think Trader Joe is going to get that many rewards.
00:06:14.678 - 00:06:46.020, Speaker A: But who knows? Trader Joe has like, funding from three Arrows capital defiance. So maybe like those, you know, those big whales can, you know, just make some phone calls and give trader Joe more incentives because they have huge bags. But you know, it's coming. And if you look into the fine print, you see that, you know, when banker Joe launches, okay, banker Joe is essentially, it's going to be a money market, right? Lending and borrowing. They're going to have Eth, USDT, Daivaxlink, bitcoin at a later date. This list will be expanded. They're going to use Chainlink, Oracle.
00:06:46.020 - 00:07:09.878, Speaker A: So it's going to be relatively safe. They're also highly audited and part of the protocol fears from Vinca Joe will be used to buy back existing Joe tokens and divert them to the X Joe token, x Joe holders. So, you know, X Joe, let's go here. Well, let's go to farm here. I don't know why it's not showing up. Maybe it's under Joe Farm. Yeah, right here.
00:07:09.878 - 00:07:39.002, Speaker A: So you can earn 30% staking Joe. It could be something you want to do. As I've often talked about, like, personally, as much as I'm bullish on the trader Joe, the application, I don't really hold any exposure to Joe Token. You can say maybe I'm coping, maybe that's true. But, you know, I think I have a pretty big, like, Avax exposure, right? I'm just holding Avax on Benki, earning 8%, you know, just sitting comfy. I also have some bitcoin in e tier as well. And like, you know, borrowing dollars and like buying stuff.
00:07:39.002 - 00:08:14.328, Speaker A: Buying stuff too. But essentially I'm just sitting comfy. I'm just essentially waiting for avian curve to come and then I'll be, you know, diverting my funds away from Venki into Aave, into curve and other farms. Because like, you should know that when Aave comes over, like billions will flow in and more applications will come, more developers will come, and you know, I think it'll be a really good farming opportunity for most people. So hopefully this gave a pretty good overview of what you can expect for the rest of the week. You know, maybe these videos will interest you, but I mean, these rates are insane, right? Like, it's gonna be. I called it the money printing game, right? Money printing game on Aave.
00:08:14.328 - 00:08:33.128, Speaker A: And I suspect the same will happen on Avalanche. And, you know, it'll be a good time. It'll be a good time. You'll be earning really good yields on stable coins, bitcoin, eth, avalanche. It'll be a good time. So let's transition over to Luna because, you know, as you know, I'm super bullish. Luna Columbus five is coming really, really soon.
00:08:33.128 - 00:09:05.150, Speaker A: I'll be recording a video tomorrow with terabytes on what you should expect. Expect that video to be out on Wednesday. But instead of, like, going over this, because I always go over this, like, the same thing over and over again, I just wanted to go through this Twitter thread by Luna Omics, a Shigeo. He's a Luna whale. And, you know, he has a pretty good interest. He has, like, an interesting mindset on how he thinks about his portfolio. And though I don't really agree, I don't really 100% agree with his portfolio construction, I think there's a lot we can learn from, like, I guess looking at what he does.
00:09:05.150 - 00:09:24.712, Speaker A: So he says that he divides his investment strategy into three buckets. Apex assets, which is Luna. Right. He just calls it apex assets because he's uber bullish Luna. He has cash flow assets, right? He farms being a liquidity provider and speculative assets. So essentially, he has a bunch of apex assets that he doesn't want to sell. Right.
00:09:24.712 - 00:09:49.420, Speaker A: So he uses it as collateral to borrow against it, as he says here. And with his cash flow assets, with the cash flow he earns from his farming, he buys more Luna or he buys speculative assets. So, you know, he kind of goes. Goes over here. So he has some photos where, you know, he has a bunch of Luna. He has it, I guess, bonded on anchor, barring a bunch of UsT against it. And with the.
00:09:49.420 - 00:10:12.736, Speaker A: And he's also farming on. He's also farming on Terrasoft, right. I think he can earn 20% or 20% to 30% on bee, Luna and Luna liquidity pools also, you know, with the funds that he's borrowing. He's farming on anchor. He's farming on pylon, you know, and what else? He's also farming on mirror. To be honest, me personally, I'm not a huge fan of the mirror token. I don't think that farm is that good.
00:10:12.736 - 00:10:34.040, Speaker A: But, you know, I mean, this guy's a whale. Like, maybe he knows something that I don't know. Right. Anchor as well. I mean, I'm farming anchor just like by borrowing dollars on anchor. But you know me personally, I'm not a huge fan of like these liquidity money, I guess these LP pairs for farm tokens. I'd rather just farm them the easier way, which is just by borrowing dollars.
00:10:34.040 - 00:11:16.132, Speaker A: As I often talk about like, you know, if you want to know like what I'm doing on Luna, I have an entire playlist on the tarot ecosystem, so check that out. I haven't really budged my, I guess my farming strategy on Luna because as you can see, like, I mean, I bought Luna like in July and this entire setup is earning me like 42%. I actually thought this is gonna like, not gonna sustain itself, but it sustained itself pretty well. And I don't really see this changing anytime soon. And with Columbus five coming, there's gonna be a bunch more farming opportunities. So I'll be updating this list or I'll be updating, I'll be updating this spreadsheet over time. Okay, so talking about avalanche Luna, there's very, very bullish catalyst coming for both.
00:11:16.132 - 00:11:54.480, Speaker A: In fact, I think with Columbus five, I think it's going to be similar to the bitcoin having and like EIP 1559 where in the short term there's not going to be that. Like it's not going to pump, right? I don't think it's going to do that well. In fact, I think the recent run up from eight dollars to forty dollars in the price of Luna has mainly been pricing Columbus five in. Right. However, I think in the mid to long term, I mean, bitcoin having super bullish for the price, EIV 1559, super bullish for the ETH price and Columbus five is going to be super bullish for the Luna price because they're literally burning Luna. That being said, let's go over to an ecosystem that I only talk about, but you know, I'm still eyeing it. And that is the Polkadot ecosystem.
00:11:54.480 - 00:12:38.352, Speaker A: This is for Kusama, right? So it's like the sister chain, it's the Canary network. But I don't really talk about it because there's not much you can do there, right? I mean you can participate in crowd loan like parachain auctions, but to be honest, like, I'm not a huge fan of like locking up my dot for two years or locking up my Kusama for 48 weeks. I mean, I don't own any, for full disclosure, I don't own dot or kusama, but I thought this was interesting. There's going to be liquid staking available on, I believe, Karura. Right, where essentially if you go to karura, you can stake your kusama, earn 16% on it, and I guess have your kusama be liquid. Because if you stake. If you participate in parachain auctions, you're gonna lock up your kusama, which I'm not a huge fan of.
00:12:38.352 - 00:12:51.962, Speaker A: Right. I hate locking up my tokens for like a year. That just sounds kind of sus. But if you can stake it on Karura, you can earn 16% and that's going to be pretty liquid. And on top of that, you're going to be earning karura rewards. Right. So if you stake Kokusama, you'll earn.
00:12:51.962 - 00:13:26.896, Speaker A: Or they're gonna be allocating 100,000 karura for two weeks. I believe this is starting the 29th or the 30th, I mean, or the 28th. Okay, so tomorrow. So I'll be linking this in the description. So, you know, you can either stake your kusama, be paid in Korea tokens, or you can provide a liquidity for liquid Kusama and kusama, which, I mean, there's not going to be impermanent loss risk here and earn, I don't know what the APR is going to be, but, you know, you're going to earn some tokens. So, you know, I still think the Polkadot ecosystem is really, really interesting. I like them personally.
00:13:26.896 - 00:13:59.058, Speaker A: So, you know, when I do take profits from avalanche and I rotate into other ones, Polkadot and kusama, they're gonna be part of the ecosystems that I'll be rotating into. Like I mentioned, I'm not rotating them into it yet. I think this is more like a Q four, Q one play. So, you know, this is something to be aware of. Right? Something to be aware of. And I really encourage everyone to, you know, just start thinking about taking profits on Avalanche because though I am super bullish on Avalanche, you know, I don't really think it's gonna, like, sustainably hit, like, these high price targets. I had a video with Benjamin Cohen.
00:13:59.058 - 00:14:27.506, Speaker A: He has like half a million subscribers on YouTube. He has these risk metrics. And at the time of recording, the price of Avax was $74 and we were roughly in the 0.65 risk range. So in fact, you shouldn't expect avalanche to get the red area here. Right? But the risk metric essentially looks at, like, what has been the historical volatility of Avax. Like, what is it capable of doing? And if you account for diminishing returns, what can you expect the price of Avax to do so.
00:14:27.506 - 00:14:41.498, Speaker A: You know, just be aware that you, like, we are no longer early on Avax. Right. The time to be early on Avax was seven weeks ago. Right. If you're buying Avax for the first time, like, are you late? I don't really think so. But are you early? Definitely not. Despite what other youtubers might tell you.
00:14:41.498 - 00:15:26.580, Speaker A: So just to be open minded about, you know, maybe thinking, maybe start thinking about rotations because, you know, I feel like I've been the most bullish youtuber when it comes to avax. But I am also realistic with my expectations because when it comes to, let me just refresh this update. Because when it comes to, I guess, price targets with crypto, it's really hard because how do you value these things? And I feel like the best way to value these ecosystem is by looking at comps. So for example, avalanche is roughly at $15 billion market cap. If it two xs, assuming nothing else moves, it's going to be higher than the market cap. Polka dot. And like, can avalanche sustainably flip Polkadot? Me personally, in my opinion, I don't think so.
00:15:26.580 - 00:15:57.082, Speaker A: Not financial advice not to like, don't get me wrong, I think Avalanche can hit dollar 200 because it could enter this huge bubble. But I don't think it can sustainably flip, let's say Solana or Polkadot, I guess in the long term, right? Because I mean, avalanche has so many bullish catalysts. So, you know, can it like double, can it three x? Of course. However, just my opinion. Like, I don't think avalanche consisting of leaflettera, Polkadot, Solana, even XRP. Actually, I don't say anything about XRP. It's kind of, it's kind of weird.
00:15:57.082 - 00:16:30.216, Speaker A: But I feel like this is like the best way to look at it because for avalanche two x, it's going to be in line with the valuation of Polkadot and that just kind of sounds expensive to me. Right. Me personally. So, you know, I mean, I, although I totally expect avalanche to flip tarot in the short term, right. In fact, if it doesn't have flip like Terra and hit like 20 billion in market cap, I'll be wildly disappointed because my avalanche bands are pretty big for those that know. But, you know, I do think that terra deserves to be in the top ten. I do think that in the long term, Terra is going to have a higher market cap in avalanche.
00:16:30.216 - 00:17:04.170, Speaker A: I'm more bullish terra than avalanche. But you know, just so you know, I'm playing the rotation game, right? I'm in avalanche because I knew this will happen and I'm going to take profits on the way up. Have I taken any profits yet? No, because I have higher expectations for avalanche for it to enter a bigger bubble. But just look at the relative market caps because I don't really talk about Solana, I don't really talk about Polkadot and definitely don't talk about doge. But does avalanche deserve to flip all these things? I don't know. I do not know. So that's just my opinion for now.
00:17:04.170 - 00:17:55.022, Speaker A: Because you have to be realistic with yourself, right? If you bought avalanche at $70, like sure you want it to go to $200, but is that based on hope or is that based on realistic expectations? I think the more realistic expectations is avalanche to enter a bubble. Maybe it'll flip Polkadot in the short term, but then it's going to just crash down like Solana did, right? Because Solana went to $200 and it just crashed. So I expect all these ecosystems to do similar things. Yeah. Hope you enjoyed the video and let me know if you're excited about avalanche rush because I definitely am. And let me know like, what your thoughts are when it comes to, like, my avalanche. I guess market cap prediction, right? Because as bullish as I am, as I have been on avalanche, I'm not that bullish, right? I'm not that bullish.
00:17:55.022 - 00:18:13.960, Speaker A: I'm realistic. Who knows? I mean, I'll be happy if I'm wrong. I'll be happy if it sustainably gets to $200 because that means like, oh, I'll make more money, but you know, I'm not gonna count on it. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe.
