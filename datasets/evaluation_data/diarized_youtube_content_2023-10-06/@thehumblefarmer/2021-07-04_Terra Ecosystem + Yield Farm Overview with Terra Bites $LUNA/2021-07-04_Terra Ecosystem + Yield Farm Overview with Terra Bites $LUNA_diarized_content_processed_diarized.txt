00:00:00.640 - 00:00:15.925, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here today. I'm very excited to invite Pete from Terabytes onto the channel. I believe he has one of the best YouTube channels covering the Terra ecosystem. So I just wanted to bring him on. Talk of the various opportunities on Terra, about yield farming and staking rewards, et cetera. So how are you doing, Pete?
00:00:16.345 - 00:00:29.953, Speaker B: Hey, doing great. Colin here from Miami. It's really hot, but other than that, doing great. And yeah, I'm so excited to be on. So excited to talk defi just in general and share all the things, all the opportunities on Terra.
00:00:30.129 - 00:00:38.841, Speaker A: Yeah. So just a brief introduction for yourself, like, who is Pete? How did you start Terabytes and how did you become such a lunatic, as they like to say?
00:00:39.033 - 00:00:43.645, Speaker B: Yeah, lunatic. There's some other, you know, dubious names like terrorists.
00:00:45.625 - 00:00:46.873, Speaker A: Maybe less appropriate.
00:00:46.929 - 00:01:18.275, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Some people say Terrans, but yeah, so it's, it's, it's, you know, I have a crypto story. I'll keep it super, super brief. Like a lot of people, I found crypto a little bit earlier, but didn't like, you know, didn't get into it, didn't really invest in it. I mined litecoin in like 2011. If I had kept that, I doubt I would be doing this podcast, you know, like, instead I was like, oh, I can make 50 cents a day on my computer, you know, and then doge and things like that. So I was like, peripherally aware of crypto.
00:01:18.275 - 00:01:46.369, Speaker B: I was a tech guy. I did programming systems and, and websites and things for small businesses and startups later. And then I went away. This is probably why again, we're doing this podcast. I went away for a couple of years and did volunteer work out in the middle of nowhere and didn't follow what was going on. Came back and bitcoin is about to fork with Bitcoin cash. And there's all this other stuff going on and exciting.
00:01:46.369 - 00:02:07.277, Speaker B: Ethereum's out, which would have driven me like crazy back in 2011. And so I just dove right in once. I, like, happened to find out all these things going on. I started writing, helping people write white papers and websites. And then I joined a company called ICO Alert. ICO is worth the future for a brief amount of time. Right.
00:02:07.277 - 00:02:35.909, Speaker B: Be your own venture capitalists kind of thing. And we didn't do ratings and shills and things. It's one of the ones that's not going to get in legal trouble ever. But yeah, worked there, did, did programming for them and content and like looking at projects and analyzing both the tech and like their perspective, you know, are they going to be. Are they good teams, stuff like that? You know, because everybody back then invested based on like a team and a white paper and a landing page. And now fast forward. I.
00:02:35.909 - 00:03:23.725, Speaker B: I started doing tech tutorials for how to build dapps. There's some Ethereum stuff, there's some EO stuff and the EO stuff, which we could talk about that at some point maybe, but the EO stuff was popular enough that I got hired by Block One and did their whole tech training program and then left. I can't Block One as the greatest lawyers in the world, so I'm not going to say anything bad about Block One, but it wasn't the place for me. And at that time I was aware of Luna in 2019, sort of because I went to Korea Blockchain Week. But it was defi summer that really popped it up on my radar. I started researching it. By the fall I was convinced and by January I was writing or by December I was writing the Tara team saying, hey, I want to start the podcast for this.
00:03:23.725 - 00:03:39.765, Speaker B: And so we're doing developer courses. We do news bites on Tuesday or Thursdays, we do lives on Tuesdays, we do happy hour chats. It's just so much content because we love everything happening in Terra. It's really changing finance for a lot of people and ultimately a lot of businesses.
00:03:40.225 - 00:04:15.905, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Terra is really cool because it's one of the few app like blockchains that actually have a real world use case. Right. It's the Chai app is used by I believe, two and a half million, I guess Koreans. So can you just briefly go over Terra and how does UST work? Because UST is an algo Stablecoin and I guess viewers of my channel, some people got wrecked in Iron Finance and whenever they hear Algo Stablecoin there's this kind of triggered. So can you just like briefly go over like what's Terra? How does UST work and why? It's like not as like risky and degen as like Iron Finance.
00:04:16.405 - 00:04:51.717, Speaker B: Sure, sure, sure. Well, it's, it's a. If you, if you want a little graphic animated video, this one's great. How does Terra work? You'll find it. It just shows you how seniorage works. Now there are other seniors, but seniorge is the idea that Luna, the Luna token is the stability mechanism. So if the dollar starts going up above a dollar, you can use the seigniorage machine like right on chain to sell or sorry, burn a dollar worth of Luna and get $1 UST or whatever amount you're going for, and then you sell it on the open market.
00:04:51.717 - 00:05:24.157, Speaker B: And if it's, let's say a dollar two, you just made two cents at scale, that matters, right? And because you sold it, brought the price down. So there's this incentive to keep UST at a dollar. If it rises, right. And if it goes under, then you can burn UST into a dollar of Luna and sell that. And so Luna is the stability mechanism, which means Luna kind of eats the price volatility of ust. And that's why there are all these great Luna rewards and staking and things. It's because it compensates the holders for taking on that risk.
00:05:24.157 - 00:06:11.961, Speaker B: If you're staking Luna, you want UST to grow because that's burning Luna, you know, and we have a net, a net burn for the past months. So now the key differentiator here with this, as opposed to like the Iron Titan saga and fei, you know, I think fei's kind of rebounded. I haven't really been watching it, but it, you know, it had a hard crash that a lot of people got burned on. Is that everything about Terra we've got? You talked about Chai, the payments app, but everything Terraform Labs does, everything all these community projects do. On yesterday's News bite, I mentioned 42 plus projects like building in Terra on Terra, and those are just the ones that had some kind of update, major ones I missed. They're all building things that require UST because it's a stablecoin platform. So you've got Chai.
00:06:11.961 - 00:06:32.705, Speaker B: I haven't verified these numbers, but Mike Novogratz dropped it on Bloomberg a couple days ago. So we're going to go with it. One of them is wrong. He said one in eight payments in Korea, that's 8%. The math didn't add up. But one of those numbers, a significant amount of payments, it used to be 6% in Korea, is running on Chai. And that's right on the Terra blockchain.
00:06:32.705 - 00:07:10.133, Speaker B: And if you go and look at the Explorer, there's a huge number of transactions going through one account. Well, that's the Chai card account. There's like a debit card that you can use and the users don't even know necessarily that it's running on blockchain because they just have this cool payments app. The merchants like it because they get instant stablecoin settlements that they can use in various ways. They get instant stablecoins, not two weeks of bank delays. And the others the users, whether they know it's blockchain or not, they love it because they get good discounts which the merchants are willing to give because you know, and so this uses UST and the fees go to Luna stakers and more. UST is in demand.
00:07:10.133 - 00:07:53.139, Speaker B: So we see the ecosystem grow. That's just one example of like the whole purpose of the whole ecosystem is to make these stablecoins more useful, more attractive to hold and to spend, to receive, to send, to use. So we've got Mirror Protocol, we'll talk about it, we'll show it. You can buy stock synthetics, no kyc, because they're synthetics. And you could be anywhere in the world and get exposure without local taxes on actual assets to stocks, things that follow stocks. You don't own the stocks but you have price exposure to them. You can farm there with liquidity providing and participate in governance and add new things, add new stocks and you can use it at Anchor Protocol.
00:07:53.139 - 00:08:47.123, Speaker B: You can use UST to put it in a position that gets you 20% roughly annually. And then that gives you a token that you can then use as collateral, like a self appreciating token that you can now use as collateral and to farm elsewhere and stuff. And then there's so much more coming which we'll talk about, but the yield aggregation and payments and donations and just people building things that use the stablecoin because it's shown stability. We had a May Day reckoning when everything crashed and UST did dip to like 92 cents and it came back up because the mechanism worked. There's limits to how quickly it works. So it took a little while because there's liquidity restrictions or you could do an Oracle attack on the network but. So it came back up and it's a dollar again and it's been really stable.
00:08:47.123 - 00:09:06.043, Speaker B: All the stablecoins took a hit in Mayday. The key is that this stablecoin has demand. That was the problem with Iron Titan. If it drops and nobody wants it because it's no different from other stablecoins, it doesn't have these use cases, then there's not the demand to bring it back up.
00:09:06.219 - 00:09:22.719, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say the difference between the Iron stablecoin and USD is that there's actually demand for USD, there's real world applic and you need UST to use on Anchor and Omir and all these apps coming up. So can you just briefly go. So I know we're going to do a little tutorial.
00:09:22.767 - 00:09:25.755, Speaker B: You keep saying briefly and I keep going into These soapboxes.
00:09:26.135 - 00:09:39.875, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So let's get into I guess Anchor Mirror and like Luna staking. Like what? Like what benefits do. Like, for example. Yeah, let's go over Luna staking. Like what the staking Luna allow you to do.
00:09:40.325 - 00:09:40.813, Speaker B: Let me.
00:09:40.869 - 00:09:43.141, Speaker A: What are the APIs and airdrops? I guess, sure.
00:09:43.173 - 00:10:03.869, Speaker B: I gotta switch my screen share here because the app is an app, the wallet's an app. So. One second. So there is a web wallet, but you need. It's only. It works with Ledger and if you're using like a local seed, then there's this dedicated app. So there's a little demo account here.
00:10:03.869 - 00:10:38.539, Speaker B: You see the staking return right now, which includes certain things. It's got taxes and Oracle rewards and things. And a lot of it comes in as Luna is 11.45% per year. But there are frequent like airdrops and in fact there are a huge number of projects I'll show them later that have already committed to airdropping to Luna stakers because they want. I mean, it's great for distribution, right? Post it to the entire ecosystem and then everybody goes and tries your app because they want to stake or provide liquidity or use it or whatever. And so you vote for validators and their staking rewards.
00:10:38.539 - 00:11:09.903, Speaker B: Like, here's the current. This is the average over the last 30 days is pretty good. Now, it's not like, I mean, this is a little low risk, right? You're not like farming and exposed to impermanent loss and having to maintain positions and risking liquidation, you know, so it's not like 4,000%, but it's a good staking reward. And you get the airdrops that are coming in. So projects that are coming out, obviously no one knows how valuable any of them are going to be. Some of them we think are going to be great. But they airdrop two Luna stakers and so in addition to Luna Rewards.
00:11:09.903 - 00:11:25.359, Speaker B: Now I just opened this account, but you'll see rewards here just come in in Luna and Stablecoins and you can regularly claim them. Plus you get weekly airdrops of Mirror and Anchor and now Pylon just weekly drops to you even if you missed the Genesis airdrop.
00:11:25.487 - 00:11:39.221, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy. Like the idea of weekly airdrops, I think that's incredible. I think the initial airdrop for Mirror was like worth like 1500-2000 dollars, like obviously depending on when you sold. But oh yeah, there's Mirror. So can you just.
00:11:39.293 - 00:11:43.189, Speaker B: It depends on it. Depending on how much Luna you had staked.
00:11:43.277 - 00:11:44.109, Speaker A: I Guess so, yeah.
00:11:44.197 - 00:11:47.061, Speaker B: But yeah, it was significant for a lot of people.
00:11:47.133 - 00:12:09.135, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And definitely like creates a community, right, Because a bunch of people stake Luna, they get free airdrops, free money and they're like, I guess builds the community, I think. Yeah, I think Luna has a great community. So yeah. Before we get into Mirror, can you go over like Anchor? Because I think that's more easier to understand. And then we'll go over Mirror.
00:12:09.295 - 00:12:41.745, Speaker B: So what is Anchor? So Anchor protocol is like a stable savings rate. Roughly stable. It wants to be a reference rate for savings. So right now it's around 20% and that's the target rate. And it's varied from 17 to 22, which is a pretty, pretty tight for something on blockchain over the past, through Mayday and all that. And the idea with Anchor is that I've got a graphic that I'll pull up for this. I don't know how to get that quickly.
00:12:41.745 - 00:13:11.393, Speaker B: But Anchor has. On one side, oops. On one side you have the borrowers, on one side you have the lenders. It's a typical money market, right, where if you're familiar with aave, you're familiar with Maker, you're familiar with Compound. However, the collateral is proof of stake, liquid proof of stake assets. So your collateral is yielding 6 to 7%. There's Luna right now, Ethereum's coming very soon.
00:13:11.393 - 00:13:38.247, Speaker B: ETH2, ETH2 derivative. And there's Solana coming and Polkadot coming and Cosmos coming as well. All being worked on. ETH is very close to ready. So you have these proof of stake assets, let's say they yield 6.5% on average. And because borrowers over collateralize, they have to, just like in Compound, aave, Maker, you are pushing those, you're multiplying those staking rewards.
00:13:38.247 - 00:14:29.167, Speaker B: So if borrowers are over collateralizing an average of 3x to be safe and you're incentivizing them to do that, then you, since the protocol is getting the proof of stake rewards on those liquid staking derivatives that are being used as collateral, that's 6.5 to 7% times 3. So you're actually getting around 20% and the borrower is posting collateral just like normal and is forfeiting those proof of stake rewards in order to borrow and is incentivized to do that with like ank tokens and some other incentives. And the len, the sorry, that's the depositor is just putting in UST, but the UST, let's say you put in $100 of UST and the borrower comes in and borrows $100 of UST. Well, they're actually posting $300 of collateral and those proof of stake rewards are going to the depositor. So you've got a 19.49% APY right now.
00:14:29.167 - 00:14:40.635, Speaker B: You can see. And if we head back, that's a day. It's only showing me one day. For some reason, I'm not sure why the interface is only showing me one day. There's a recent update they must have.
00:14:41.275 - 00:15:09.545, Speaker A: But usually it's been, like you said, roughly 17 to 22%. It's been pretty good in terms of keeping its fixed interest rate. I know do says they're targeting 20%, but I think this is really cool, especially if we are in a bear market, or as I like to say, a crab market where we just go sideways. If you park your stable coins here, earning 20%, that's pretty good. And you can I guess also get paid to borrow, which he'll go over later.
00:15:10.645 - 00:15:30.709, Speaker B: Yeah, and you can use. I'll demo this stuff. And you can use the. Even though you're earning at 20%, you can use that position as collateral to use on mirror and stuff and earn. You could farm it. You can earn more. So you could be delta neutral, even like not care which way the market goes and be farming 40 to 80.
00:15:30.709 - 00:15:48.421, Speaker B: Right now Twitter is 80 something percent on Mirror. If you farm, you farm short and long at the same time and you use the anchor collateral to back that. And it's really cool. It's like a strategy where if Twitter goes up, hey, it's making money. If Twitter goes down, I'm making money. If it stays sideways, I'm making money. And some people want that.
00:15:48.421 - 00:15:58.219, Speaker B: Yeah, there's people that want to ape into 5000% and risk rug pulls, but eventually you've got money that you don't want to be doing that with. Great options.
00:15:58.357 - 00:16:04.155, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you go over to the bonds tab to just show I guess my viewers like how to. I guess.
00:16:04.535 - 00:16:16.488, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just stopped. I just swapped in the Terror Station app. There's a swap right there in the wallet. I swapped on chain to UST from the Luna I had in that. So there we go. 84.
00:16:16.488 - 00:16:22.967, Speaker B: 84. Sorry. So let's. I have some Luna too. So let me. Let me actually borrow. All right.
00:16:22.967 - 00:16:35.389, Speaker B: In order to borrow, I need to have bonded Luna. What that means is that's a liquid staking derivative. So like it allows the protocol to get the staking rewards. Even though I still have the Luna.
00:16:35.517 - 00:16:37.365, Speaker A: And that's how they generate the APIs.
00:16:37.485 - 00:17:12.401, Speaker B: Right. And I can come in here and I can bond like well, roughly the exact amount or I can actually go to terraswap and swap it, which sometime because people want to get out of it instantly sometimes and not wait the unstake time. So like right now I could come in and I'd actually make a little bit. But sometimes on some days when there's demand this will be 9 or 10 and you can make some extra Luna on the swap here at app terraswap IO but so let me bond it really quick. I'm going to come in and just bond. I don't want to bond at all. In case we need Luna for something later in the video.
00:17:12.401 - 00:17:19.001, Speaker B: Just bond like 5 Luna, you pick a validator because you are staking. It's staking derivative and all.
00:17:19.033 - 00:17:22.248, Speaker A: Yeah. And you can choose any validator. Right. Like all the list.
00:17:22.376 - 00:17:46.000, Speaker B: Well, there's a. It's, it's a. It's a bit more curated based on uptime and past performance. So it's not the full validator list. But you, but validators are free to apply for that, you know, because of, because of slashing risk, which is a risk to the protocol you can get insurance for and because of other kinds of risk. Like there's a special, like there's a special bar of metrics there. All right, so I've got some bluna.
00:17:46.000 - 00:17:48.921, Speaker B: Now be Luna. I can come in. Yeah.
00:17:49.033 - 00:17:54.545, Speaker A: And that was a 25 cent fee, so it's not as cheap as Polygon, but it's definitely cheaper than Ethereum.
00:17:54.705 - 00:18:01.205, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a spam filter, basically. And you don't, I mean, don't do this with a dollar.
00:18:01.905 - 00:18:02.569, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:02.697 - 00:18:21.699, Speaker B: All right, so you can see over here. This is absurd. And this will change. I've seen it over 200, I've seen it at 30 or 40. This is the money you're making in order to borrow because the protocol needs borrowers. And especially right now because of Mayday. Mayday scared a lot of people about leverage in all markets.
00:18:21.699 - 00:18:25.459, Speaker B: Right. Like people are. They're still levered t gens but, you.
00:18:25.467 - 00:18:37.571, Speaker A: Know, and like, yeah, Mayday being like the. In the month of May, there was like a week where terra went like - 80% and I'm sure there was like a bunch of liquidations that happened on anchor.
00:18:37.683 - 00:18:42.721, Speaker B: Everything went, I mean, I know Terra was hit hard, but everything went like bitcoin. Right. Crashed.
00:18:42.833 - 00:18:44.085, Speaker A: Yeah. Market.
00:18:45.225 - 00:19:11.135, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. There are $10 billion of liquidations just all across the board in that one day. And anyway, so you're actually making 140% to borrow because the protocol is rewarding you to do that. Now that might go down, but this is crazy. You could post collateral, you could borrow $10,000 and then it pay it off over time with the borrow rewards. So I come in, I provide some Luna here, Luna. I'll go ahead and provide all five of it.
00:19:11.135 - 00:19:40.929, Speaker B: And I got to enter my password into the extension. I'll save it for an hour. There's a six second block time, so you wait a minute. And then I've got this position and I've got a borrow limit of $14. And so I'm still holding the Luna or soon the Ethereum, the Solana, the Cosmos, the Polka Dot. And I can come in and borrow. Obviously it's not all money, but I only put in this.
00:19:40.929 - 00:20:02.097, Speaker B: Right. And that's the limit at which I'm subject to being liquidated. The protocol, in order to remain solvent, has to be able to liquidate positions. Right. It's just like maker of a compound. Now there's been talk of changing this limit, but exciting is that there are already ways to watch this. Like you can run an app on your computer that saves your position if you're about to get liquidated.
00:20:02.097 - 00:20:30.123, Speaker B: And Anchor is working on a vault where you can set it so that your loan automatically, like if you're getting close to liquidation, it sells off a little bit of your collateral to save your position. And you could pick that. So exciting. Like Defi Saver on Ethereum, which is an app everyone on Ethereum should take a look at. Not advice, but you know, and so you come in, let me borrow, I'll just borrow some money here. And by the end of this video we should see some ANK rewards already safe. A safe ish borrow.
00:20:30.123 - 00:20:52.015, Speaker B: You can't actually go over a certain amount that you, you could in the contract, I think. But the UI will stop you from going up to like the instant liquidate number. So I'll, I'll go ahead and borrow down here. And you can see my liquidation. Luna price is like $2.86, which is a 50% drop. And, and I just borrowed some money and now I'm actually making money on that money.
00:20:52.015 - 00:20:53.335, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
00:20:53.715 - 00:21:13.367, Speaker A: Because if you look at the borrow amount, yeah. I think it says you're paying 15% like interest rate on dollars or just like whatever you're borrowing. But Anchor is rewarding you with 156% paid in anchor tokens, similar to the AAVE liquidity money. Rewards where you're being paid to borrow, Right?
00:21:13.391 - 00:21:34.215, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And the reason for that is that the protocol currently has more depositors than borrowers and it needs borrowers. Right, so. And people are scared because of liquidations, but that'll be settled out as there's liquidation protection. So now I can come into Earn over here. I could also, I can use my ANK Rewards, provide liquidity and stuff. We have a tiny bit already.
00:21:34.215 - 00:21:58.165, Speaker B: I mean it's less than a cent, but we've accumulated a tiny bit on that tiny borrow position. I can use that to provide liquidity or governance. But the most exciting thing of course is I can come in and I can deposit dollars here. Let's deposit $50 into borrow or excuse me, earn. And that's just safe. We'll talk about the risks, but it's safe 20%. And now once that's done.
00:21:58.165 - 00:22:31.965, Speaker B: All right, so I've got $50 in there and that gives me this AUST asset you're used to getting if you do liquidity, providing you're used to getting like LP coins and things that represent your position. Right. You see, it's not exactly 50 because Anchor's value, its value is going up because these positions growing. So I've got this a ust and now I can use it. I could send it to you and now you have my position or I could stake it somewhere, I can use it as collateral and Mirror, which we'll talk about Mirror next. Anchor is exciting. There's more proof of stake assets coming out which will limit the volatility.
00:22:31.965 - 00:22:58.031, Speaker B: Right. Because there's multiple collateral assets, multiple collateral backings. We've got some integrations that are live and some immigrations that are coming out. And there's even. Now that we've done this on Anchor, I think we can leave this. There's even the ability to use other stablecoins on Ethereum on something called Ethanchor, which is recently developed. So you can come in and deposit Tether, USD, Coin, Binance USD or DAI and get.
00:22:58.031 - 00:23:39.023, Speaker B: And you won't get as much because you're not going on the Terra chain or whatever, but you can come and earn with those stablecoins too. So it's becoming multistablecoin, multi chain as well. There are Terra apps and Terra assets on Uniswap and Ethereum and Binance smart chain and bridging to other networks. Bridges are on Testnet and Mainnet. Terra's point isn't to replace Ethereum, it's to bring this amazing stablecoin that is very useful to as many chains as possible. It's already on Ethereum so you can farm, you could farm Terra things on Ethereum if you prefer Ethereum at places like Harvest Finance and Cream has, has one as well. Cream has ust and it's, you know, you.
00:23:39.023 - 00:23:44.675, Speaker B: I'm not going to run through all of them. Yeah, but it's here. The stop mirror stocks are here.
00:23:45.055 - 00:24:14.107, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really cool. This is like I guess the only risk. Oh yeah, yeah. So these are all the apps that if you stake your Luna in the future you'll get all these airdrops. But I think it's really cool that you know you can get paid to borrow. I guess I think a bunch of my audience were spoiled back in May when like everyone was being paid to borrow and stuff. I guess the only risk is that because you're using these volatile assets as collateral there is a higher chance of you being liquidated.
00:24:14.107 - 00:24:35.859, Speaker A: So you have to I guess do the mental math of okay, what happens if a May event happens? Right. Like what if Bitcoin drops another 30%, how dangerous one position be? So you can't really use stablecoins as collateral and stuff. So I think that's the only risk. But yeah, I think it's really cool. And let's now transition over to the mirror protocol. I want to see something to say.
00:24:35.947 - 00:24:53.381, Speaker B: Well yeah, let's talk about risks really quick. You can use stablecoins as collateral in other places. It's just not an anchor because stablecoins don't yield their own proof of stake rewards. Right. The protocol wouldn't work now. There is going to be stablecoin collateral money markets on terror with Mars. We'll talk about that later.
00:24:53.381 - 00:25:38.673, Speaker B: But let's talk about risks really quick first. You mentioned one liquidations. Liquidations on centralized exchanges or decentralized places. They really suck because they can cascade. You have somebody who gets liquidated and that sells off some of the collateral and then the price goes down more and it triggers the next person. It's like a stop loss cascade on an exchange where the price just hits a point where it triggers in house of cards price goes down. It happens with bitcoin price there was a crash a while back where on Arthur Hayes on Bitfinex the price like we looked at it, the price probably would have gone to zero because of the cascading liquidations.
00:25:38.673 - 00:26:09.223, Speaker B: And they stopped it. Like they halted, they halted everything from happening because it's just overlevered markets, man. So there's liquidation risk that's going to be made better. You can run bots now and you could set up notifications, desktop notifications for your position. And you can, of course, try to be as safe with that number as possible. But it's going to be better when there's liquidation protection built in. And there's also a protocol called Harpoon that's coming out that should reduce the liquidation penalty, making it more.
00:26:09.223 - 00:26:46.553, Speaker B: Right now it's like 30% and that's a max, but it should reduce the liquidation penalty, making it less disastrous, I guess, if you're liquidated. And also the protocol is building in liquidation protection of various kinds. That's one risk. But there's also the risk of stablecoin peg, which we got to talk about, and the risk of smart contract bugs, which happen even to audited things. Right. Anyone who's playing like knows if you've been in the space. You know the Iron bank, right? This amazing product, but Green mouth finance and $35 million or something lost to an exploit.
00:26:46.553 - 00:27:39.051, Speaker B: And Flash loan attacks, which are amazing to investigate how complex these kids build these Flash loan attacks where they manipulate the price and then arbitrage it by borrowing money and paying it back in the same transaction. There's crazy things that happen and even audits can't catch potential. Like there are just edge cases. Maybe there's an exploit, right? So there could be something that we don't know about. Like on any smart contract platform, even though it's been audited by multiple teams, and even though the contracts are in rust, which is safer in some ways than solidity, there's still that risk because by nature, like, unknown risks are unknown. So what do you do about that? Well, there's insurance and there's already insurance out in Nexus Mutual. You can get Nexus Mutual coverage on your anchor position for, I think it was 6% last I checked, but that was a month ago or weeks ago.
00:27:39.051 - 00:28:08.275, Speaker B: It's probably lower now because the more stakers to it, the lower it gets. So you're still netting like 13 to 14% insured growth. So if there's a smart contract exploit, you can claim the Nexus Mutual insurance. There's other. There's like probably half a dozen others that are working to add anchor insurance. There's an algorithmic native insurance to anchor called Ozone coming out on Terra, which algorithmic, meaning you're. You're in a protected pool and you can choose to claim from that instead of the anchor pool.
00:28:08.275 - 00:28:35.521, Speaker B: So, like, it's not. There's not a claims process. There's an override process that governance can do and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. But there's not like this, you know, manual claims process and that's cool. And that'll be funded with in like mid July. And then there's unslashed finance, which is slashing insurance and also PEG insurance for stablecoin peg. So all these insurance options coming in, some of them are just going to be integrated into the anchor apps you use in the future right now.
00:28:35.521 - 00:28:53.117, Speaker B: But right now if you want insurance, you can go to Nexus Mutual. And then there's finally stablecoin peg. I mentioned that. There's also stablecoin PEG insurance un finance you can take out. If the peg goes under 95% for two weeks, it'll pay out, pay out to you. But that's always risk. Right.
00:28:53.117 - 00:29:13.625, Speaker B: Even though there's massive demand, algorithmic stablecoins are really new. Terra's proven itself. It was born in a bear market, did fine. It was in a bull market, did fine. It went through Covid crash. It went through May Day, recent May crash. And yeah, its peg has been up or down a little bit, just like other algo stablecoins, but it's returned to a dollar.
00:29:13.625 - 00:29:23.611, Speaker B: But you can also get insurance out against that. So not to talk too much about risks, but those are the main risks across all these protocols and there are insurance or other protection options for all of them.
00:29:23.763 - 00:29:38.843, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for covering them. And yeah, I agree. I think UST is, I think the market cap of the UST coins like around 2 billion, I believe maybe I might be off a little bit, but it's definitely more lindy than other algo stable coins out there.
00:29:38.979 - 00:29:40.015, Speaker B: Let's take a look.
00:29:40.435 - 00:29:41.215, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:44.485 - 00:29:47.061, Speaker B: The market cap is. Yep, it's about 2 billion.
00:29:47.093 - 00:30:01.589, Speaker A: Yeah, 2. Yeah, yeah. So awesome. Yeah, thanks for going over the risks. So let's go over the second great farming opportunity available in on Terra, which is Mirror. Right. So I'll let you take it away.
00:30:01.757 - 00:30:22.613, Speaker B: Yeah, this one's great. Mirror is synthetics. So mostly stocks, but also things like, you know, there's bitcoin and Ethereum on there as well. I don't like bitcoin synthetics because I'm kind of a bitcoiner. I don't want derivative bitcoin, but it's going to happen and eventually we'll have bridges or whatever. But so Mirror lets you. I'm not going to go through all this.
00:30:22.613 - 00:30:40.965, Speaker B: Let's just go to the mirror. Let's just go to the Mirror page and check it out. All right, so we've got mirror here. This is a new interface. I like it. And it's very purpose driven. You come in here to trade, you come here to borrow, like borrow stocks against UST collateral or something.
00:30:40.965 - 00:31:22.163, Speaker B: You come in here to farm or you come in here to do governance, right? So let's check out trade. There's these synthetic stocks and baba. The price follows pretty tightly. It's off market, it can go up because people want to get yields and so they come in and they're buying MTESLA or Baba and there's no Oracle feed to manage the price. So off market you can see a premium, especially during weekends. So don't buy like unless you expect a certain stock move on Monday, don't come in like Sunday and buy stocks or if you do check the price and so and it only goes up like what, five, five dollars or something, $10 on Alibaba. But so these prices, these stocks here, I can come in and buy them.
00:31:22.163 - 00:32:11.187, Speaker B: There's a variety of assets and more assets are added by governance. There's not a ton of assets yet, but there will be more and more and more and more as the protocol matures. So you come and buy oil or Facebook or whatever and you could provide liquidity on these. And one of the great things is that these are a lot more stable than crypto. Like if you're out there providing like you know, some puppy coin on one side and like I don't know, some off brand smart contract chain on the other side coins that we have never heard of and one crashes or pumps and impermanent loss is huge, right. Or you get rug pulled, right? But these are like pretty stable over time relative to crypto. So your impermanent loss risk is lower, much lower.
00:32:11.187 - 00:32:54.991, Speaker B: So you can come into Twitter and you'd buy and sell. There's limit order functionality, there's slippage control and the things you'd expect from like an AMM and, and you can come in and borrow these things as well if you want to take short positions. So you can come in and borrow Apple, you have to actually post collateral, but you can post other stocks as collateral which opens up all kinds of fun ideas. So you can come in and post some dollar collateral to borrow the stock and then sell it because you're shorting it. And then later when it goes down, if your strategy is right, you buy it back and pay it back. It's typical shorting enabled on stocks. And this is, this is great right here.
00:32:54.991 - 00:33:19.529, Speaker B: If you want to do this, you can use this anchor. Remember I deposited to anchor. I have this asset now that's going up in value and it's going up 20% per year. So I can use that to borrow Apple stock. And this collateral ratio will get safe. If Apple stock stays the same price, this collateral ratio will just get safer. But if Apple Stock goes up 20% over the year, which is a reasonable number for some years.
00:33:19.529 - 00:33:35.605, Speaker B: Right. My collateral also went up 20% so my position isn't unsafe. Right. So there's less liquidation risk here. You could still go like safer for sure. And there's also like an anchor. There's you know eventually going to be protection here.
00:33:35.605 - 00:34:06.843, Speaker B: So you could just come in and borrow stock and you short it. There's a fee to prevent people from like, like manipulating some things once you close the position. So typical, typical fee that you'd pay if you're shorting on some centralized platform. So actually a little better. So you've got this appreciating asset now that's making money and you're using that to borrow an asset to short. So what if you came in and not only are you shorting, but you can short farm. The protocol incentivizes you to short farm.
00:34:06.843 - 00:34:12.443, Speaker B: So if I come into, what was it? Apple. Oh man, that is a terrible short farm percentage.
00:34:12.539 - 00:34:14.387, Speaker A: It's only 3.5%.
00:34:14.571 - 00:34:55.334, Speaker B: I guess a lot of people are shorting Apple right now. But you know, you come in on some something that people are a little bit less sure about shorting like GameStop. I guess people have confidence in GameStop and so you go short on it and it gives you the whole borrow thing here so that you don't have to go elsewhere and do it. And what's cool is that the ust, you'll get the UST from shorting it and you can deploy it later. You can put it back in Anchor and actually then have like let's say you put $40 worth of anchor in and then it shorts for $20 because you're borrowing at 200%. Oh wow. This, this has a different collateral ratio.
00:34:55.674 - 00:34:56.842, Speaker A: Because it's more volatile.
00:34:56.938 - 00:35:18.755, Speaker B: Yeah. Games. Yeah. When, when the asset was voted in. The governance also votes on the current the parameters and they can be changed later and you can put it polls. So anyway, so I can come in and short this and then the UST from selling it will be given back to me in two weeks. There's protocol reasons for why the delay and I can then put that back into anchor and with some assets I could have 100% of my position in Anchor.
00:35:18.755 - 00:35:36.315, Speaker B: And still have this short farming going on. So if you come in a short farm and you long farm the same asset and if you really want to be safe, you're going to do this with something like, you know, the spy or something that's not going to go crazy because Wall Street Bets found it. Right.
00:35:37.935 - 00:35:55.725, Speaker A: Sorry to interrupt you. Sorry to interrupt you. But just for the short form, let's focus on the spy, the S and P. So right now it's at 8.44%. Right. So just by shorting, just by posting collateral and shorting the asset, you're being paid 8.44% paid in the mirror token.
00:35:55.725 - 00:35:56.181, Speaker A: Correct?
00:35:56.293 - 00:36:21.765, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. You're being paid to short because the protocol, in order to keep the price right needs shorters and long LPs and short. There's actually a short LP token, the mechanics you can read the white paper for. And you're not exposed to a permanent loss when you farm short. It's you're paid based on the premium and how much your short position helps. Basically, if you go long, you are and you and you lp.
00:36:21.765 - 00:36:38.351, Speaker B: Right. Not just hold, then you are exposed to il, of course. But not only are you getting those rewards, you mentioned the 8.4%, but remember, if you're using anchors collateral, you're also getting the 20%. So you come in and do both and then you don't care if the market goes up or down.
00:36:38.503 - 00:37:03.701, Speaker A: Yeah. So you can take essentially you can take $100 short position and $100 LP position like going along and then you're just capturing these liquidity money rewards. So if you go to. Can you go down to the spy tab again? Sure, sure. So right now it's you're being paid 8.44 percentage short and like 30 and like 35. 34% too long or no, 30.
00:37:03.701 - 00:37:21.339, Speaker A: Yeah, 34%. So if you. This is called a delta neutral strategy where you don't really care if sqi goes up or down. You're just capturing these rewards for free. Right. So if you short and long S and P in equal amounts, you get paid like 43% a year according to current numbers. Right.
00:37:21.467 - 00:37:50.765, Speaker B: Right. Now you'll also need to provide if you're long, if you're just longing by holding, which is totally valid, then you're not going to get this farm percentage. You're just balancing out your short. You'll also need to provide additional dollars ust in order to farm. And that's not going to get the yield. Well, it'll get the yield, but it can't be anchored. So like if you're, if you're shorting a certain amount, like $100 spy and $100 long, then you'll need $400 total.
00:37:50.765 - 00:38:13.359, Speaker B: And a lot of that can be anchor UST, but because on the short you need to over collateralize and on the long you need to provide the other side of the liquidity pool. This sounds complicated and it definitely is. But if you check out delta neutral, if we have a video on this and there's actually like three. Oh no.
00:38:13.407 - 00:38:15.175, Speaker A: Oh that's, that's the V1.
00:38:15.215 - 00:38:19.767, Speaker B: No, no, no, that's, that's, yeah, that's an, that's an earlier video. Yeah, we have a video.
00:38:19.831 - 00:38:55.543, Speaker A: I'll also make tutorials too. And like, like I said, terabytes also has like a bunch of good tutorials on mirror and anchor. So I suggest you check that out. And I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be going on vacation soon, but when I get back I'll definitely be participating in Luna just because I just think these rewards are insane. I mean Delta Neutral earning 40 plus percent, like that's crazy. So I guess my next question is like obviously these rewards are being paid out in the mirror token, right? And on anchor, they're paid out in the anchor token when you're borrowing. So how long do you.
00:38:55.719 - 00:39:08.717, Speaker B: They're also paid out in the actual stock and ust because you get the fees from the liquidity pool. So your positions that LP is getting more valuable. But yeah, most of it is mirror for sure.
00:39:08.781 - 00:39:19.925, Speaker A: Yeah. So how long do you expect? Obviously we don't know but like how long do you expect these high ap y high aprs to last? Just because at some point they have to lower the emissions.
00:39:19.965 - 00:39:52.735, Speaker B: Right, right, right. So quickly before that, and this is just going to take a second, you can take those mirror rewards and further compound them. You could stake them to governance for 39% or you could come in and provide LP on mirror for 70%. So your rewards are compounding above and beyond that, when you're calculating your numbers, compound interest is phenomenal. Right? Was it Einstein who said it's the eighth wonder of the world and those who understand it earn it and those who don't pay it.
00:39:53.995 - 00:39:54.691, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:39:54.803 - 00:40:16.535, Speaker B: So some great options. But yeah, of course. So the mere price matters here for these percentages. If MIR sees more usage and more TVL then the mirror price goes up. We're going to get into that. But the mirror price goes up in most possible circumstances and then these percentages go up. However, as more people farm, the percentages go down because it's a static like amount of Mirror being issued.
00:40:16.535 - 00:41:04.063, Speaker B: And also as more assets get listed unless governance elects to not provide mere rewards for new assets. So you've got these assets as we list more assets, which is probably why there's not a thousand assets because the community doesn't want to dilute too much. But as more assets with like penny stocks, as more assets are listed, these rewards will spread out, the liquidity rewards won't. So there's actually a V3 mirror proposal. If you ever want to see what's going on at any of these, there's a forum page on all of them. There's Agora Term Money, there's Forum mirror finance, there's forumanchorprotocol.com and the main focus right now, even though Mirror issuance is continuing for four years, the main focus right now.
00:41:04.063 - 00:41:47.995, Speaker B: This is the wrong one, I'm sorry. The main focus is increasing like decreasing the reliance on Mirror rewards and increasing the other kinds of rewards by allowing by better capital efficiency, by more transaction volume. Which means Mirror is going to be enabled not only on Ethereum products and other like Solana products and things like that, but also on Mars and Levana which is perps and ETFs which we'll talk about just like more usage and things and front end integrations with cool like gimmicks really where they use these. So that's the focus of the team right now, is decreasing the dependence on mere issuance in order to make this like a long term sustainable yield platform.
00:41:48.155 - 00:42:22.845, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for sharing that. And I think though mentioned this in one of his podcasts, he's in a bunch of podcasts but I think Mirror is seeing a lot of use in Thailand just because I'm an American. So I already have access to Apple stock. So I might not see the value Mirror, I guess the synthetic stocks but for other countries, those people living in different countries don't have access to American assets through a Mirror. They can do that. And I think Mirror already had like $2 billion TVL. So there's like no, there is like a lot of money in Mirror right now.
00:42:22.845 - 00:42:52.677, Speaker A: And I know like I talked to like someone who works at a fund and they were like, oh yeah, like I'm, I'm farming on Mirror right now. So it's definitely an opportunity that I also want to be a part of and I'll be making a lot of content around Terra in the future just because there's a lot of I guess future products coming out. So can we transition to I guess what's coming up in Terra's future? Because I know, I know Mars is something I'm interested in but. Yeah, do you want to take away like.
00:42:52.861 - 00:43:44.185, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Let me, let me just really quick hit. The goal of all this is to make them super normal, like normie friendly, user friendly eventually, right? What I showed on Mirror, your audience, a lot of your audience, right, they're defi savvy, they'll be able to, you know, the computer savvy, they'll be able to go do it. But your average like person on the street would be like what is short form long? Like what the heck is going on? And so Mirror like all of these things like especially the Mirror app and the Chai app and stuff. They have super normie friendly like app versions. Now this isn't available in the US for several reasons, but you can just come in and buy Mirror stocks and it doesn't have the farming, they haven't integrated that yet. They might make it easy eventually, but you can come in with a credit card, with Bitcoin, with a bank, just come in and buy stocks on Mirror Wallet.
00:43:44.185 - 00:44:07.495, Speaker B: And this is what a lot of people in Thailand and things are using because it's easy access to these stock price movements. So you come in and just pick a stock and buy it. There's going to be user friendly versions and there are for all these things too because Terra's focus is on normal people eventually. And also by the way, check this out, pre IPOs are on mirror.
00:44:08.755 - 00:44:13.787, Speaker A: Yeah, you can speculate on the opening price I guess of how Robinhood will.
00:44:13.811 - 00:44:45.079, Speaker B: Open up and stuff basically. So I'll talk about Nebula and Mars. There are so many things coming out, but these are cool and defi oriented and yield oriented and they tightly integrate with everything else. So they'll make ust more useful and they'll also make anchor more useful and Mirror more useful. We're all building like these defi primitives that are just like growing and growing and this is a tiny percentage of what TFL's like total plan is. So check this out. Nebula is ETFs and I think it's NEB Finance.
00:44:45.079 - 00:45:13.129, Speaker B: You can't really. It's not out yet so this doesn't even go anywhere. But it's coming out soon. The airdrop is going to Luna stakers and it's better for stakers to smaller validators, not to the huge ones. There's like a bit of a decentralization push where all the validators are getting equal amounts of Nebula and they're voters, right? So check this out. Nebula is ETFs, exchange traded funds. If you're familiar.
00:45:13.129 - 00:45:33.355, Speaker B: ETFs are generally like their baskets of assets or they follow particular strategies. You can invest in a fund and you're investing in a strategy. Maybe it's a strategy like, hey, I think genomics is going to be great. I'm going to invest in the Ark Genomics fund. It invests in companies that do genomics. Or maybe I think, you know, maybe I'm going short. I want to invest in like a short, like a VXI or something fund.
00:45:33.355 - 00:46:06.975, Speaker B: And it works, you know, to short the market. Or I want to invest in a gold mining ETF or like a. Something like that, right? And a strategy or a sector or something like that. And you can invest in it easily in one thing now, but Nebula, what Nebula does is these are algorithmic and on chain and transparent. You can see the parameters for the fund and you can see its performance and things like that. You can see exactly what it'll do under what circumstances and invest in it as an ETF. So here's just some examples of the launch ETFs.
00:46:06.975 - 00:46:21.047, Speaker B: They're deploying six main ones. Other people can make them eventually. You could make a strategy and subscribe to it and hope others do so. Terraforming cluster. Here's 1. Gain exposure to the terra ecosystem. Okay, this is the simplest.
00:46:21.047 - 00:46:43.573, Speaker B: It's rebalanced by market cap and more assets can be added later. That's cool. The let it roll cluster. This one actually you're investing in the top five performing stocks over the previous 30 days. And it's rebalanced by price performance. So the stock starts running over the past month, it bounces into that. So you're catching the wave.
00:46:43.573 - 00:46:59.025, Speaker B: Obviously there's not guaranteed performance on anything in investing ever. But if you like this strategy, you think we're in a bowl. You think stocks that do well are going to continue to do well. Hey, there you go. Top five stocks. And it just manages it for you. Rebalances dynamically.
00:46:59.025 - 00:47:45.363, Speaker B: And then here's a complicated one and that you could click into the forum to view the algorithms. A Golden Cross follower. You like Golden Cross, which works better in stocks than crypto traditionally. Just like the death cross doesn't really apply to crypto, despite the fud. So the golden cross, if an asset enters a bullish golden cross and its market cap is sufficiently high, then you're invested into that and it rebalances based on a combo of market cap and that Golden Cross. So you're following a very specific strategy based on chart movements and things. As just an automated ETF with its, you can verify that it's going to do what it's going to do by you know, the code if you're, if you're a coder or like looking at the parameters.
00:47:45.363 - 00:47:57.267, Speaker B: So this is a really cool add on because these things will all be usable. You know, you'll be able to use them in mirror, you'll be able to use them in other strategies and things like that. And then Mars, Mars is a.
00:47:57.411 - 00:48:38.929, Speaker A: Sorry, before you go over Mars, I just want to touch on I guess Nebula and it's like, I guess like Pete said, it's like there's a lot of apps building on top of the Terry ecosystem which are targeting like more of the average person. Right. And these I guess algorithmic ETFs. Like I can definitely see real world use cases of those because it might like, I guess like the Golden Cross etf. That's not something I would be interested in like as a humble farmer. But you can definitely see like the real real world use cases of these products. And as you know, more products are built, there's more demand for USD which means that the entire Luna ecosystem does well as well.
00:48:38.929 - 00:48:43.953, Speaker A: So I think it's incredible. That's all I wanted to say.
00:48:44.049 - 00:49:22.043, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. And as cross chain, more cross chain bridges come online, there's several, like I said in Testnet, there's a semi centralized bridge which is okay for the time being. We're waiting on some developments in Wormhole Solana's multi chain bridge. But there's right now you can send assets to Ethereum or Binance smart chain from to Terra easily and Cosmos IBC is going to activate which means you could Send over to crypto.com or BNB chain if they turned it on or like secret network for private defi, things like that. And so there's going to be more and more cross chain asset transfer. And once that's enabled you could do these ETFs with cryptos.
00:49:22.043 - 00:49:42.253, Speaker B: Right. You could do like, like crypto performance strategies with these kind of things as well. Like an ETF that exits losers and piles into winners or conversely an ETF that tries to buy low. So yeah, I think there's some great potential here. It's going to focus on stocks now but eventually we'll have all kinds of assets in there.
00:49:42.389 - 00:49:49.445, Speaker A: Yeah. And now let's get over to Mars. I think Mars is the One I'm most excited about. Do you want to take it away?
00:49:49.605 - 00:50:50.255, Speaker B: Sure. Mars is a little bit farther. Well, it's probably a lot farther than Nebula, so sorry, it's the one you're really excited about. But imagine just a super more powerful money market where you can, you can borrow against Apple stock and receive more Apple stock or like you can deposit Apple stock and receive Bitcoin. You can elect to receive any asset on any other asset and just super multicolateral deposits and multicolateral interests as well. And there's a lot more going into Mars that you can check out in their light paper which came out and the Mars protocol is really trying to be. It's trying to be safe and they're using a new algorithmic utilization ratio to manage the protocol that was developed at Delphi Digital.
00:50:50.255 - 00:51:21.799, Speaker B: It has multiple levels of. I'm looking for a specific chart here going to the math of the reactive interest rate solution which is an upgrade to the interest rate calculations on current defi platforms. And there it is. So there's multiple like besides the money market the typical and maker has something like this. The typical like money market protections of liquidations. There's also an insurance fund which is self yielding thanks to anchor. So the insurance fund grows over time.
00:51:21.799 - 00:52:00.707, Speaker B: And then there's the governance trance where the Mars staking pool is used as defense. And then there's finally this is what maker had to do back in the COVID crash. They had to make a like a significant governance move and auction off a bunch of maker in order to save the protocol. So there is that like final level but there's like multiple levels of protection in this money market. And I don't want to go into all these details but the Mars protocol light paper is where it's at to find out what they're doing. And just to give you a hint of where they're at, they're working on more Oracle solutions right now. Mirror uses band oracles for stocks.
00:52:00.707 - 00:52:51.189, Speaker B: And there's one of the concerns over time we want to have multiple Oracle points and band is decentralized but have multiple Oracle points as well. So they're working on Oracle solutions to make it more robust and more safe. And they're working on the UI and there's an alpha coming out. So if you poke around enough and talk to enough people, eventually you'll figure out how to get into the alpha test program that's coming out soon. So anyway, that's Mars and Mars is working on being like the defi bank of the Future. So it's not just like it says, the galaxy's most powerful borrowing and lending protocol, meaning most powerful. Meaning they strive to be the safest, they strive to be the most profitable, they strive to be the most diverse.
00:52:51.189 - 00:53:08.875, Speaker B: I mean, again, you want to deposit your Apple stock and earn Bitcoin. You want to borrow against something you're holding, and you want to borrow a completely different asset and then farm with it. You know, it's like. It's like supercharged money markets integrated with everything we've seen so far.
00:53:09.495 - 00:53:09.895, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:09.935 - 00:53:24.087, Speaker B: So that. That's. That's Mars. In short, we don't have as much information on this as, like, it's the dynamic interest rate that they've really been pushing recently for efficiencies. We don't have as much information on this as the others yet, so something to keep an eye on.
00:53:24.111 - 00:53:58.379, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think that was a great overview of, I guess what's currently available, like anchor and your as well as, like, what's coming up in the near future. Something that I really like about, I guess the Luna ecosystem is like the community. Like, I made a tweet a few days ago. Like, hey, I'm trying to learn more about the Luna ecosystem. Like, can anyone, like, refer me to good content and like, I guess influencers. And I had like a bunch of people retweet, even though the founder of Terra like, commented. And like a bunch of like, people like Joseph, for example, DM me like, and like, answered all my questions.
00:53:58.379 - 00:54:08.655, Speaker A: So I really like. I really like the Luna community. How about you? Like, what do you like most about the Luna community? Yeah, I think it's a stronger community than most.
00:54:09.115 - 00:54:32.495, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, I've been around long enough to remember and it's not even that long, but I remember when it was just like a few people initially. Tara just kept their heads down and built. And no, do was not on any podcasts. Now he's on like, so many. He's coming out on Real Vision shortly. You know, he was on arc arc recently, so big ones, but he'll also do small ones.
00:54:32.495 - 00:54:54.619, Speaker B: You know, do do will come on like tiny channels sometimes. It depends on the community and what like he's. And he's. He's really approachable. If he watches Twitter, it's very like, aggro. And that's a specific Twitter personality that does really well. Don't think he's like his Twitter account, which is joking and shitposting all the time, you know, like, but.
00:54:54.619 - 00:55:25.841, Speaker B: But watch a video with him. He's very engaging. Comes in, in Telegram. He answers. If you go look at his tweets and replies. He's answering people like their basic questions, you know, like, here's what you need to do for collateral, whatever he's. And so like and the team is like that we're hoping to get more people on but that after in like the fall of last year, they really started turning up the community, brought on a community manager, started communicating more, more decentralized governance in these protocols and it just went, we went ballistic from in January till now.
00:55:25.841 - 00:56:24.969, Speaker B: So many people, we've got some friends who are investors like Mike Novogratz and Mike Arrington and I mean Coinbase Ventures is an investor and a lot of exchanges as well. And they're starting to talk about it like as a. Mike was on Bloomberg the other day and talked about Luna and Chai and UST and Anchor and doe. And so the community has been growing and growing and growing and it is the most supportive community that I've been in both from Terraform Labs side. If you have a project you think it's cool that integrates this stuff or just if you're using UST in your project on Ethereum, they'll pay for your audit, you know, and they're just community support. I know projects that have like they've gotten help, they've said hey, I'm building this thing and they've gotten funding or they've gotten free interns for a while to help build, they get support, they get free advertising, they get to get on podcasts, you know, like just to super supportive community. If you have projects you want to build, even if you're not a dev, you're a product person, you want to come in and build something.
00:56:24.969 - 00:56:54.503, Speaker B: There's NFT standard going on. There's like all sorts of charity focused things. There's, there's banks and like this, these apps. I've shown that like the Chai app that that's being built in multiple places in the world, like a debit card that easily lets you use like anchor and stuff in this cool little app. There's Alice in the us there's Cash in emerging markets, there's Tick in Australia, there's. They've renamed recently. They used to be Saturn in Europe, there's Memepe in Mongolia.
00:56:54.503 - 00:57:05.799, Speaker B: All these apps being built. The community is really coming together. I've been in several crypto communities deeply and this is by far the most supportive and exciting one I've been in.
00:57:05.967 - 00:57:24.243, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's great. So in Terms of. Let's try to wrap up the video now. So let's say a viewer of my channel is interested in participating in the Terra ecosystem, but don't know how to get started. Like, how would you. How do. How would you like, I guess recommend someone that's trying to participate.
00:57:24.243 - 00:57:28.099, Speaker A: Like what would be. Like the steps that you would recommend those people.
00:57:28.267 - 00:58:06.317, Speaker B: So again, I can't recommend financial advice, but if you're. But I recommend like a path, right? If you're. If you're looking to participate from an investing farming perspective, which I'm sure is a lot of people, you. It depends on your jurisdiction. We used to use like Kucoin or Binance to come in and buy some Luna and then you send it out and once you get it, you can use Uniswap if you need to and use the Bridge Terra money to send it over and then you get Luna or UST into the ecosystem. You could swap it on chain and do all the cool stuff with it right there. If you're in the US or other jurisdictions that have cryptocom, I think that's Europe UK.
00:58:06.317 - 00:58:27.117, Speaker B: That is a great way. The crypto.com app, which a lot of people already use, you can come in and with a credit card or debit card, you might get closed down if you're doing a huge amount because credit cards don't like crypto. But small amounts should be fine. You come in and buy Luna right there and it offers withdrawals and you withdraw out. 0% fee. I think right now on buying Luna in the Cryptocom app.
00:58:27.117 - 00:58:48.015, Speaker B: And it's also an off ramp, right. Or if you need to get back at an IFIA. So crypto.com is a great way as well. There's like coin, coinmama and coin, there's several. There's a lot of places to get Lunar ust, but those are the two I'd recommend depending on where you are. Kucoin, Binance, Uniswap if you're in a really tough area, or Crypto.
00:58:48.015 - 00:59:32.355, Speaker B: Com if you're in like the U.S. hong Kong, Europe, something like that. And if you're coming in and you want to just get involved in other ways, you can follow the Terabytes podcast. We've got interviews, weekly news bites like live chats where you can come in and comment and we answer as many questions as possible from the community, whether they're super noobish or advanced. Me and my partner go on and that's a great place to follow. Go ahead and follow Terra Money. You know doe, there's discords and telegrams you can go to and that's you know, if you like a project seriously reach out to them and they will be more, more than likely they will be happy to, to hear your ideas, add your ideas, bring you on.
00:59:32.355 - 01:00:00.537, Speaker B: The number of people who have been like hired into projects and quit their job or left from something related or unrelated has just been astounding. Everybody wants good people right now. Everybody wants this community feel is so focused. It's not like it was before where everybody wanted to kill Ethereum. Especially in this cosmos ecosystem. All these sovereign chains have their focus. Terra's like hey, we got a stablecoin.
01:00:00.537 - 01:00:23.609, Speaker B: We're going to make it great. And they are super happy to work with any other community that needs a good stablecoin or wants to integrate or you know, it's, it's just an amazing community. I don't want to talk, I could talk forever about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's what I'd say to do and hey, don't be, don't be scared to reach out if you have a specific question about how to get involved. We answer messages on any topic.
01:00:23.777 - 01:00:46.845, Speaker A: Yeah, Terabytes is a great channel. So I recommend everyone go over there, I guess 14 tutorials and those live stream AMAs. And yeah like I mentioned, I also agree like these. I guess as a humble farmer. Right. These opportunities are really good and because the matic rewards have kind of dried up. I mean they're still good but I think I'll be diversifying some.
01:00:46.845 - 01:01:06.515, Speaker A: Some of my portfolios. Terra mostly using anchor and Luna for sorry, anchor and mirror for now. So look out for those videos in the next couple of weeks. So that being said, I think this is a great video. I really appreciate you coming onto the channel. Do you have any like parting words and then we'll wrap the, wrap up the video.
01:01:06.975 - 01:01:21.079, Speaker B: No, I really appreciate it. Stay safe out there. Defi is an incredible place to be no matter the networks you're on. It's. It's also a risky place. You know, try to, try not to try to get you rugged. Right.
01:01:21.079 - 01:01:27.365, Speaker B: But thanks for having me on. It's been great and look forward to chatting again in the future.
01:01:27.705 - 01:01:29.985, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Thank you guys for watching and have a great day.
