00:00:01.040 - 00:00:21.001, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. And in this video I'll be discussing a potential rotation to the Luna and Avalanche ecosystem as well as addressing some FUD in the Harmony ecosystem. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Now this is financial advice. Okay, so let's get started. So obviously everyone has subscribed to me to watch me draw red boxes on charts. Well, here you go.
00:00:21.033 - 00:00:21.201, Speaker B: Right?
00:00:21.233 - 00:01:05.965, Speaker A: And obviously this is bullish and I'm quite surprised that it took this long for Avalanche. I guess the ecosystem would catch a bit. I mean the fundamentals of the ecosystem has been, I mean it's been improving like every single day. But the price of like tokens such as Avalanche Joe hasn't done that well. And I do think that this is the, this is the move, right? I do, I think this, I do think this will stick and I do think that it's going to make its way to $100 as long as bitcoin and ether behave, right? Because if bitcoin volatility spikes up to the upside or downside, sure, like some, the bid might, you know, go, go back to bitcoin. But you know, in this type of environment where bitcoin is bullish, consolidate and consolidating eth, hitting all time highs, you know, it's calming down a bit. Now this is a time where other L1 such as, you know, Avalanche, Luna, Solana and Harmony, you know, they do catch a bit.
00:01:05.965 - 00:01:48.569, Speaker A: So let's kind of discuss. So I have a working thesis on why the Avalanche ecosystem has lagged in the past month or so, right? Because I mean if you take out the, I guess the price movement today, the Avalanche token hasn't done much right. Since October, even though I still love the ecosystem. So I have a working thesis on this on like why things has happened and why Avalanche has lagged equals to the why Avalanche has lagged ecosystems such as Phantom, right? So let's kind of go over my working thesis. My conviction level on this is low. So we'll see like how this plays out and maybe you know, over time we can revise this thesis. But essentially, you know, I've often mentioned that like Avalanche, I'm bullish Avalanche.
00:01:48.569 - 00:02:14.181, Speaker A: And it's, it's a great ecosystem, right? And the reason I rotated away from Avalanche to Phantom was because I'm a profit maxi, right? I'm a yield maxi. I go where the yields are. I go where I can make the most money. And in the month of October, I thought I can make more money on Phantom than Avalanche. So I rotated. If the narrative changes, if the thesis changes, I'll go back to Avalanche, right? I'm a yield maxi, right? I go where I make, I go where I can, where I think I can make the most money. And Phantom in October went up more than 2x, right? So that was a good rotation.
00:02:14.181 - 00:03:07.199, Speaker A: And I think the Phantom move, the meat of the move has played out. I'm still bullish Phantom, right? I'm still like the majority of my funds are parked on Phantom right? Farming. However, you know, Avalanche is looking more attractive, right? As well as Luna. So one of the reasons I think the Avalanche ecosystem has kind of lagged and what was like, I guess less hyped up? Well, sure, like the Avalanche rush was like delayed for a month. So like that kind of killed the hype. But I guess the stage one, the phase one of Avalanche and its ecosystem, right, being built out through Avalanche and whatever relied on eth based projects bridging over, right? Such as AAVE Curve, Kyber, et cetera, right? But these projects, their tokens are already diluted, right? They're considered safe, right? They're like the blue chips, I guess in defi. But they can't really offer high inflationary rewards compared to new ecosystem projects which deters farmers to stay on Avalanche.
00:03:07.199 - 00:04:32.429, Speaker A: So to I guess further expand on this point, an example is Geist, right? The reason I rotated to Phantom away from Avalanche was because Geist launched with like 1000% APYs and it was backed by the Phantom team and you know, everyone felt comfortable aping in and billions flocked to the Phantom ecosystem which you know, led to the Phantom price double like over like going up more than 2x in the span of like a couple of weeks. So what Geist was is it's a fork of ave, right? And they, because it's a new project, they can introduce a new token and with a new token they can just jack up the inflationary rewards and get if the farmers, right? Like myself, just super high ap wise, right? And as yield Maxis, I have to go here, right? Like how can I not go here, right? Because should I stay on AAVE and just you know, capture like 2% APY or should I bridge to Phantom earning like 1000% APY? And I guess more importantly, they built confidence in the protocol safety by having a Phantom co founder back it, right? So they launched it like, you know, it was like a pseudo stealth launch. They backed it with, I guess one of the Phantom co founders backed it with his Own money and his own, with his own name. And they're like, here like bridge over yada, yada, yada, and profit driven farmers, you know, will bridge the phantom for the gains, right? It's a rational thing to do, right? We're all rational actors here. So the question is, after you bridge the Phantom right through Geist and you have your funds parked there, is it worth bridging back to Avalanche in the short term?
00:04:32.477 - 00:04:32.733, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:32.789 - 00:04:54.039, Speaker A: In October, the answer was no. The spell form on Abracadabra on Phantom was super high ev. And I thought it was higher ev, right, expected value than any stable farm on Avalanche. So I stayed, right? I'm a yield maxi. I'm not loyal to any chain. I just go where the yields are. All right, this is like, I mean, this is an outdated photo, but, you know, like you can earn roughly 25, 30% on spell on stable coins.
00:04:54.039 - 00:05:41.277, Speaker A: So what I've been doing for the, for, for, for a long time is, you know, bitcoin eth. Phantom on collateral as collateral, borrow stable coins against it and you know, put it here and earn yield on my Bitcoin Ethan Phantom indirectly. Obviously my position has changed and whatever in the past couple of weeks, but that's kind of how I saw it, right? Yield maxi, right? Don't be too loyal to any chain. The best farmers are the best yield farmers are not loyal to any chain. And they're yield maxis, right? Because I guess when it comes to market psychology, like once you buy something, it gets easy to hold on to your bags, right? I've definitely fallen victim to that mindset before. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to opportunity cost, right? I didn't leave Avalanche because I was bearish Avalanche. I left Avalanche because I could make more money.
00:05:41.277 - 00:06:22.643, Speaker A: I could make more money on Phantom. And you know, if I think I can make more money on Avalanche, I'll bridge back, right? I'm a simple, I'm a simple guy, right? I just like, want to make money. So this is part of the liquidity wars amongst L1s where they have to offer you, right? The humble farmer army the best yield, right? Because the humble former army, we go, we bridge, right? We go everywhere where the best deals are. So that's kind of how I, how I thought about it. And you know, in the past couple of weeks, I think it's time to change the thesis, right? Congrats, Kevin. Your memes are pretty good. And you know, when I saw this, I was like, damn, like, is Kevin targeting me with this meme? Like you know, so definitely adjusting the thesis.
00:06:22.643 - 00:07:02.867, Speaker A: So you know, let's, let's, let's talk about some hopium for Diamond Shoulders because you know, right now it's up almost 10% and hopefully this move sticks. So one of the reasons like I mentioned before, it's like you know, the, I guess old either Ethereum projects like, for example Aave Kyber, like they can't give you like over 100% APY right? Because their tokens are already diluted, their market caps are already too big. So you know it's safe but you know the yields are less exciting than like some, you know, safe work on Phantom. But maybe there's a bigger plan, maybe there's a bigger plan and you know, we should be aware of it. So this is a crypto fish. He's the co founder of Trader Joe, right. And let's go back here.
00:07:02.867 - 00:07:45.545, Speaker A: So phase one was all about attracting big projects to come over without overspending has completed, right? So they allocated some funds from Avalanche Rush and they're like hey aave, come over Curve, come over Kyber, come over Parasoft, come over yada like build like the, I guess the foundation of the avalanche ecosystem. And one of the reasons like Trader Joe was like did so well is because they have their own token, right? Like sushiswap will never overcome Trader Joe because Trader Joe can always offer better yields. The announcement of avalanche incentives back in mid August enticed many builders to build on Avalanche. And like I mentioned in a previous tweet, you typically need three months to build and deploy an object. And Avalanche Rush was announced in roughly mid August. Right. So three months is mid November.
00:07:45.545 - 00:08:33.353, Speaker A: Interesting. So guess what? They're all launching soon. I know because I'm constantly getting pulled into telegram groups with new projects launch launching soon every single day. So you know, this is, this is, I mean, I guess this is like copium, right? I mean like Phantom projects are more exciting because they're new and their APIs are pretty high. But if Avalanche native projects can launch, right? That is backed by I guess the Avalanche team or you know like in, or just like you know, if, if, if the teams can ensure safety of the project and they can offer good APIs and they have good products, you know, maybe it's for bridging back, right? Because right now I feel like the, the most enticing project on Avalanche is Wonderland and Trader Joe. But that's been that way since like August, right? So there hasn't been really new exciting things. Come on.
00:08:33.353 - 00:09:17.639, Speaker A: Sure. You can show me your, like your random Ponzi, like, for example, like Smart coin, right? Like, what the hell. That obviously is a thing. But generally for the long term sustainability of these ecosystems, you need quality projects that's going to stand the test of time. And if you look at the bridging data, I mean, today, I don't know why it's over, but generally in the last 30 days it's been pretty positive. And you can assume that if more money is coming in than going out, generally you should expect the price of Avalanche to go up because, I mean, more people coming in, more people need gas and you can kind of look at the active users and whatnot. Now, like anyone can like create multiple wallets and like, you know, kind of like make this data, like unreliable.
00:09:17.639 - 00:09:48.491, Speaker A: But, you know, I don't think that, you know, I don't think they're faking it anyway, whatsoever. And in terms of TVL, we see Avalanche in the top five. They're actually number four, I believe, just because, yes, Terra is at 10.57 billion, but if you click 3 billion is like Lido. And Lido is not a Terra project, right? I mean, Lido, I mean Terra has a connection with Lido, but it's not actually, you know, a Terra project. So in actuality, I think Avalanche is a top four ecosystem. Top four ecosystem in terms of tvl.
00:09:48.491 - 00:10:18.253, Speaker A: And maybe they do flip Solana, right? Because, I mean, I don't want to bet against Sam, but you know, the farms on Terra, the farms on Avalanche, the farms on Phantom are much better than the farms on Solana in my opinion. Right? That might change. The facts might change. But in the meantime, I really don't see a reason to bridge this, Lana, just because the yields are not as high as, you know, the other ecosystems. So we'll see. We'll see if that happens. And we also saw that Avalanche foundation launched a $200 million fund, dedicated, dedicated, supporting ecosystem development and innovation.
00:10:18.253 - 00:11:02.275, Speaker A: Maybe they took a page out of the Phantom ecosystem notebook where the Phantom ecosystem, their billion dollar inside the program is essentially like paying the developers, right? So maybe, you know, like if the, if the Federal Reserve has taught us anything, if you see a problem just throwing more money at it, right? It generally works. So, you know, Ava Labs throwing more money at it, backing it with three arrows capital, polychain, etc. Right? Very, very reputable VCs. I think this is going to be bullish for. Yeah, I think it's going to actually be bullish for like Wonderland, just because, I mean, Wonderland hasn't really received avalanche incentives, but, you know, they're one of the. If you want to, I guess, help fund developers, I feel like you have to help develop. Like Danny, right? Danny is like the Occupy Defi.
00:11:02.275 - 00:11:18.355, Speaker A: He's like the benevolent dictator in the Frog Nation. He did a show on Frog Radio. I recommend everyone watch this. It was a good one. I was in this, right? I took a bunch of notes. So if you want to know what he's building out with Wonderland and Popsicle Afro Cadaver, I'm super bullish on all of them. Check it out.
00:11:18.355 - 00:11:41.001, Speaker A: So I think this could be indirectly a bullish catalyst for Wonderland. All right, so. And also the Geotoken has done the well. Has done well, so look out for that too. Okay, that being said, let's go back to the slide deck and go over the Terra ecosystem. Because I've often be super. I mean, I mean, I've been super vocal about being super bullish Terra, but, like, not gonna lie.
00:11:41.001 - 00:12:13.985, Speaker A: Like, my bags have been pretty light, right? So I've been trying to change that in the past couple of weeks. I've been, or I guess in the past week or so, you know, like, I bought some Luna because there are key catalysts coming up. I guess I own more Luna than I do Avalanches, because with Luna, like, there's actually like, you know, like dates on, like, or I guess like rough dates on, like when things are happening. Whereas Avalanche, you know, like, maybe new apps come in like mid November, but, like, nothing is that clear yet. Right. So Luna. So I guess there are two protocols that I'm super bullish on is Mars and Astroport.
00:12:13.985 - 00:12:20.821, Speaker A: So Mars is going to be like a money market on steroids. I've heard rumblings about when they're gonna launch. Hopefully in Q4.
00:12:20.893 - 00:12:21.341, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:21.453 - 00:12:51.279, Speaker A: Apparently the auditing firms have been backlogged and that's been a bottleneck. So worst case scenario, they launch in Q1. So just temper your expectations. But when this does launch, I think it's going to be an insanely bullish catalyst for the Terra ecosystem. Also Astroport. So I've discussed Astroport on my channel a few times, but I also believe that Astroport is going to be a pretty big catalyst just because, you know, ecosystems need a really good amm, right? A really good dex. And they're going to be airdropping tokens retroactively to pass Terra users.
00:12:51.279 - 00:12:52.983, Speaker A: You can't receive it anymore.
00:12:53.039 - 00:12:53.255, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:53.295 - 00:13:14.701, Speaker A: So hopefully this airdrop is going to be worth a lot. And one of the reasons why I believe that Astroport airdrop is going to be worth at least four figures is because Nexus protocol. Right. I mean I staked 500 with the anchor in September in order to get this airdrop and I got over $800 of airdrops. Right. This is a pretty insane airdrop. We'll talk about this later too.
00:13:14.701 - 00:13:23.725, Speaker A: But I do think that, you know, one way to create excitement in the community is you know, just making your previous, I guess, making your community more money.
00:13:23.765 - 00:13:23.941, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:23.973 - 00:13:45.399, Speaker A: So I think the asteroid air drop is going to be a big one. I suspect it's going to be at least four, four figures. Best case scenario, five figures. But I mean that's, that's like full, full Hopium. But we could see fireworks, right? We could see fireworks. So it's going to go over like why Astroport is super important because right now there's terraswap which is the, I guess the incumbent Dex. But they were never intended to be the winner.
00:13:45.399 - 00:14:01.487, Speaker A: Right. That Terra swap was built out of necessity and you know, it's not really like a, that exciting of a decentralized exchange. So this is Jose Maria Macedo. He's, he's at Delphi, Delphi Digital I think. Delphi Digital, they're one of like the gigabrines in the space. They're like a consulting firm, research. Yeah.
00:14:01.487 - 00:14:05.663, Speaker A: And they're working behind the scenes to help Astroport and Mars launch.
00:14:05.719 - 00:14:05.959, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:06.007 - 00:14:39.197, Speaker A: So just let that digest a little bit. So he said that you know, it's gonna, it's going to be launching in mid November, right. And fairly certain it's going to happen and they're going to have a bunch of cool products. So first of all they're going to have the standard X times Y equals K pool. Right. So this is like, this is like essentially all like I guess decentralized exchanges use this particular pool. But also it's going to allow for stable, stable swaps such as like swapping between B Luna to Luna, like USD to another stable coin, etc.
00:14:39.197 - 00:15:37.033, Speaker A: And this is think of this as like a curve, right? So Astroport is going to be a standard Dex with additional I guess curve models such as like a Staples model like similar curve. They're always, they're also going to have liquidity bootstrapping pool with the way Balancer does. So you know, any project that wants to launch on, that wants to launch on, on Terra can you know, use Balance's way to I guess avoid whales like taking up all the, all the coins and whatnot. And the stable swap part is really Interesting because it allows for projects like Orion Protocol, right? So if you don't know what Orion is, Orion is a way for people on Ethereum and other chains to gain access to the 20 yield on anchor. So what you can do is on it, on the Ethereum main net, you can just deposit like stable coins on Orion and then Orion will in the back end take that, turn it into USD and put it into anchor and then pay you back like 20%.
00:15:37.089 - 00:15:37.545, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:37.665 - 00:16:08.901, Speaker A: It's going to be lower because like there's going to be slippage, there's going to be fees and whatnot. But that's kind of the point. So if on the back end Astroport can facilitate a more capital efficient way to transport, I guess, swap between USDC and USD, for example, it's going to create more demand for USD. It's going to create more demand for I guess, anchor yields and whatnot, which is pretty, pretty impressive. And obviously the airdrop is going to be so. Okay, so this is going to be, this is a little confusing. So I'm going to try to have Danku on the channel sometime to kind of explain it because he's kind of an expert.
00:16:08.901 - 00:17:09.741, Speaker A: But phase zero, which I believe is going to be mid November, is going to be astral drop to Astro, drop to retroactively airdrop to historical participants in major T5 protocols. So if you've been using Luna Ecosystem for like a couple months, I'm sure you'll get this. And you know, I'm really, I'm really, really excited for it and Mars hopefully comes soon. Okay, what else am I going to go over? So let's go over, let's go over to Harmony Custom just because I know there's a bunch of people that's like new to crypto, right? New to farming, new to defi. And I guess there, I guess when you're a new farmer, it's hard to get your mentality right. It's like the farmer mentality and the trader mentality is completely different, right? We're more focused on yield and it's great if we're farming something that goes up. But if we're earning super high rates on a particular asset, like we don't care if that, like if you're earning like let's say 1000% APY, like you're going to be euphoric if the price is going sideways, right? Because you're just earning more of a token.
00:17:09.741 - 00:17:51.665, Speaker A: If you're like, even if the token goes down a little bit, you're still going to beat you fork because that's because you're earning a bunch of tokens. So when it comes to Harmony, yes, I do think it's a good ecosystem. I do think it's an immature ecosystem, right? I mean, they don't even have chainlink. Like, they barely have any protocols, right? Like, if you remove Defi kingdoms from Harmony, like, that ecosystem is, like, really not worth bridging over to, right? So it just takes time, right? I'm sure it's going to be a thriving ecosystem at some point. And I've often, like, thought that, you know, this is going to be a Q4 to Q1 rotation, right? I mean, I said the same for Phantom, right? Phantom is just like, happened, waved way too fast, so that rotation already happened. But, you know, Harmony, I think it's going to play out in Q4 and Q1, right? It just takes time. So.
00:17:51.665 - 00:18:09.077, Speaker A: And you know, when I. I guess, like when the price of Juul went from $5.50 to like $3.50, people were like, scared everywhere. Like, I just got a bunch of DMs and like, hey, hey, Tyche, are you going to sell your juul? Like, like, no. Like, like, look at this chart. Like, this is.
00:18:09.077 - 00:18:25.213, Speaker A: This is not bearish. This is not bearish, right? And I just want to kind of go over. This is. This is pep talk, right? This is. This is former pep talk. You got to get it, get it, get your head on straight, right? I even get a haircut for this moment, right? So, you know, price jump price dumps 30% on Joule. People panic.
00:18:25.213 - 00:19:07.571, Speaker A: Why? Why? Like, what was your plan to begin with, right? Are you serious? Are you really scared of 350 joule, right? This thing was like a dollar like a month ago. Like, come on. So this is a farmer mentality. This is the farmer's mentality, right? And it kind of speaks to positioning, right? Positioning your portfolio, positioning yourself, and mentally preparing yourself for what's about to happen. Harmony might be ready in Q1, right? Chain link keeps getting delayed, so maybe it ends up becoming Q1 rotation. If Harmony is going to be a thriving ecosystem in Q1, who cares what happens to the price of Juul right now, right? If you think Harmony is going to be $1 or 1 to $1, right? Think of that. You know, if that.
00:19:07.571 - 00:20:10.097, Speaker A: If you think that meme is going to happen in Q1, who cares what's happening to the price of one? The price of jewel? Right now your goal should be to farm, preparing for that rotation, right? Right now I don't have that many funds deployed to Harmony just because, I mean I have Defi Kingdoms. But you know, like, I feel like you can. There's like better short term opportunities in Luna and Avalanche, for example, right? So. But at some point it's going to make sense to bridge over to Harmony, right? Because you know, a bunch of product projects are being built out and at some point it's gonna be worth it. So there's that, right? If Harmony works, my jewel form prints, right? I mean that you can say the same for like anything, any, any form that you're in that isn't a total scam, right? If Harmony sucks, Joel might expand to other ecosystems, right? So I guess like the hedge, if Harmony like does like you know, keep delaying it, it's like it's like kind of dies. Then like Jewel, they have the ability to expand to other ecosystems, right? I mean, I know like Phantom, they were looking at Phantom. I know the Avalanche guys were like really like hey, like hey, come, come over, come over, Defi Kingdoms.
00:20:10.097 - 00:20:15.911, Speaker A: Like we really want to have you here. The point is, have a plan. Why are you in Defi Kingdoms?
00:20:15.993 - 00:20:16.187, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:16.211 - 00:20:20.171, Speaker A: For example, right. And other farms or whatever. For me, this is my pseudo gaming.
00:20:20.203 - 00:20:21.627, Speaker B: In Harmony play, right?
00:20:21.691 - 00:20:49.187, Speaker A: And I have a relatively longer term time horizon when it comes to Harmony. I think it's going to be ready in Q1, right? Ready meaning that you know, like the ecosystem isn't just like kind of dead, right? More like more legitimate protocols coming, AAVE coming, more Ethereum based projects coming, etc. So if I'm positioning for that, then I don't really care what happens to Rise of Joule. Because in my mind, if Harmony works, then think about. So let's imagine a scenario where like Harmony is trading at a dollar, right?
00:20:49.331 - 00:20:49.875, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:49.995 - 00:21:34.941, Speaker A: Maybe we live in that scenario, maybe we don't, right? But if that happens, like think about how much TVL is going to be in the Harmony ecosystem. And if you think about how much TVL is going to be in the Harmony ecosystem, think about how much of that TVL is going to be in Defi Kingdoms. And then with that mindset, think about what would the price of Joule be at in that scenario in Q1? Probably to be fine, right? Probably going to be fine. Maybe it's Maybe trading at $3, right? Maybe the price just goes flat for three months. But that's still euphoric, right? You should still be euphoric because you can farm it with like 4 digit aprs. Or maybe it's like 3 digit now, but like you know, the aprs are pretty insane. Also, like, what is the role of Defi kingdoms in your portfolio? For me, this is a way to gain exposure to Harmony Ecosystem without really, you know, thinking about it, right? I just turn my brain off.
00:21:34.941 - 00:21:59.399, Speaker A: I'm like, I'll check this position in January, February or whatever, you know, I'm going to have a huge bag of Juul. And, you know, maybe, hopefully it's still, like, it's still worth something, right? But it's. I didn't position my, like, Defi Kingdom position, like, as like, a huge part of my portfolio for, like, you know, If Juul dumps 50%. Yeah, I'm sad. But, you know, at least I had a thesis. At least, like, you know, I had a plan, right? Because if you don't have a plan in crypto, then you're going to sell your bags too early. You're going to.
00:21:59.399 - 00:22:24.635, Speaker A: You're going to panic, sell the dump. I mean, you know, like, all the memes, right? This is my highest conviction farm. I did not lie when I said that. Like, I don't lie, right? I'm generally, like, transparent, like, when it comes to, like, my thesis and whatnot. And if your entire network is on Harmony Ecosystem, then, you know, you should understand that, you know, the ecosystem is not ready. Right? It's very, very immature. Maybe you're going to be euphoric in three months from now, but just temper your expectations.
00:22:24.635 - 00:22:30.679, Speaker A: So that's the end of presentation. So discuss the Luna Avalanche and Harmony. See how it's doing.
00:22:30.727 - 00:22:30.951, Speaker B: All right?
00:22:30.983 - 00:22:50.615, Speaker A: Luna doing well. If you want to see more red boxes, here you go, right? Bam, boom. Bullish Harmony. Yeah, I mean, this is even bearish. Like, why are people scared? So also, I think Solana is a good one, too. I'm bullish Solana. It's just that as a farmer, the yields on Solana aren't that great.
00:22:50.615 - 00:23:12.625, Speaker A: So I don't really see a point in bridging the Solana. If you want to buy the Solana token, right, like, you know, and, like, stake it on Marinade, earn 7% or whatever. Sure, that could be a good strategy. And, you know, you don't really want to fade, Sam. And if you think about, like, where all the money is coming from, a bunch of institutional flow is going into sauna, right? So, you know, I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna fight the big wall. A big, big wall of money.
00:23:12.625 - 00:23:57.461, Speaker A: But in crypto, you can't own everything you want to own. Like, if I had more money, I would just, like, you know, buy, buy more things, right? But you know, my capital is limited, my headspace is limited and you know I don't own like 10 different bags, right? I just own like a few core positions that I can manage and you know, that I have conviction on because I would rather you know, have a bunch of funds concentrated on like three coins than like a bunch of money scattered across 20 coins because like how are you gonna manage that, right? So there's always opportunity cost. There's always like no cause an opportunity overload. But that's kind of how I think about it. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe.
