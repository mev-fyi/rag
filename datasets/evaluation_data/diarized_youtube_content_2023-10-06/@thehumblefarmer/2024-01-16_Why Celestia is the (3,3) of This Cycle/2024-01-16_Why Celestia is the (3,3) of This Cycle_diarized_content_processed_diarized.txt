00:00:00.920 - 00:00:19.326, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Taiki here. And today I want to discuss why I believe Celestia is going to be this cycles three three. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord. The link will be in the description below. Prices will be going up at the end of the month. Okay, so let's get right into it. So this weekend, last weekend on Saturday, I woke up around 08:00 a.m.
00:00:19.326 - 00:01:10.850, Speaker A: and I just had this epiphany and I felt like I just had to put this idea down on Twitter and see how people will react. And, and it's, you know, it's a pretty controversial, I guess, headline, why Tia is going to be this cycles three three. It's going to be a long read, but I'm going to just read through this and give, I guess, provide some color, my commentary. And I think if you're new to crypto or you're exploring crypto and thinking about why prices move the way they do, I think understanding, I guess, the bulkies and the narrative around Celestia will be pretty beneficial in order for you to navigate future crypto cycles. And, you know, this is just a culmination of my knowledge for being in the space for a very long time, but let's get right into it. So this video or this piece is going to be separated into four sections. What is Celestia? What's the narrative around token? What similarities does Tia have with three three? So Olympus Dao, right? Three three.
00:01:10.850 - 00:01:33.200, Speaker A: And what I'm doing to prefer for this. Okay, so cool. And I know people think of Olympus Tao as a ponzi and in a way it was a ponzi. Of course it was a transparent ponzi. Everyone knew the games or everyone knew the rules of the game, but people just aped in and, you know, some people made a bunch of money, some people lost a bunch of money. It is what it is. That's how markets work.
00:01:33.200 - 00:02:05.462, Speaker A: I am not claiming Celestia to be a ponzi. No, I'm just, I guess, making comparisons on why I think Celestia will enter a bubble and I think we are in the middle of the bubble right now. I think Celestia is, I mean, objectively one of the most important technical, techno, technological advancements that we've seen in a long time. And if you want to read some more, I guess, content on it, I don't want this video to be too long. I'm not going to just explain data availability and why that's important. To you, but Nosleep John on Twitter has a really good piece on it. Eric Wall.
00:02:05.462 - 00:02:40.812, Speaker A: I think he's a pretty well respected figure in the space. He's an early investor in Celestia, and, you know, he's bull up on it since 2022. But I guess my TLDR is that Celestia makes it easier and cheaper for new projects to deploy new roll ups and blockchains, or basically, like, more roll ups. For example, Manta network saved over 99% in fees by using Celestia for DA instead of Ethereum. And these are significant cost savings that can be passed down to users. So you can go here and they use Lustia to post data, and it's really expensive for new teams to, I guess, spin up new blockchains. Right.
00:02:40.812 - 00:02:59.980, Speaker A: You have to figure out the data availability layer. You have to pay validators. It's a lot of work, and Celestia just specializes in the DA layer, and it just makes it easier and faster to spin up new roll ups. That's kind of the idea. And it's a pure growth narrative. Celestia makes almost no money. I mean, their business model is to save people money.
00:02:59.980 - 00:03:37.150, Speaker A: So naturally, you know, there really isn't that much, I guess, revenues or profits to be realized. However, you know, if you think about growth narratives and, you know, infinite pe ratios and whatnot, if Celestia is the way for thousands and hundreds or millions of new roll ups to launch in the coming years, then, yeah, at some point they have to figure out how to monetize that. Right. It's kind of like, you know, uber, you know, like, they made no money, and then now they make money. That's kind of the idea with these types of liquid venture investments. But no, that's the idea. And, you know, I mean, I'll provide this thread in the description below so you can kind of read through this if you want to.
00:03:37.150 - 00:04:20.510, Speaker A: This is a ten minute video that I think explains it much better. To be honest, I'm not really technologically that savvy. I'm more a student of, you know, crypto ponsonomics, how, you know, why prices move, where money flows, why things happen, and looking more into, you know, I guess, like, where the space is going. That's kind of my strength. My strength is not really explaining, you know, like, modular blockchains, monolithic blockchains, like pros and cons of both. It's more, okay, like, I understand 80% to 90% of, you know, the gist of everything in crypto, and then it's my job to determine, okay, what makes good investments, what makes good, I guess, trade opportunities, and whether it's worth risking my own capital. That's kind of what I focus on and, like, my research company, whatnot.
00:04:20.510 - 00:04:45.362, Speaker A: But let's talk about the narrative around Celestia now that you kind of understand what it is. But, you know, I believe Celestia and the token Tia is the purest way. Right? The purest way to gain exposure to the airdrop narrative. In 2024 and 2025, we've already had two big airdrops, the Tia stakers, or maybe not that big. I think Saga is going to be, like, a pretty weak one, I'm not going to lie. And I think dimension is going to be a pretty strong one. And many more confirmed.
00:04:45.362 - 00:05:05.082, Speaker A: So there's manta network, which I'll get into more later. So, yeah, let's get right into it. So, you know, like I mentioned, Celeste makes it easier for new roll ups. Launch some roll ups will airdrop to tsteakers. That's the Cosmos e does. If you think about all the projects that's launched using the Cosmos SDK, they've all staked. Sorry.
00:05:05.082 - 00:05:40.300, Speaker A: They've all airdropped to Atom stakers, right? Even Celestia airdropped to Atom and Osmo stakers. It's part of the ethos. So if you're using the Cosmos SDK or even Celestia for DA, and you don't airdrop tokens to the community, then pitchforks will come out, right? People will be pissed. And there's a chance that there is no community that's going to form and all the tokens are going to be in the team and the VC's. And of course, if they make a really, really good product, then, yeah, price can go up. But, you know, like, do we really want to support those stingy teams, VC's, as, you know, as a liquid market participator, right. I don't really participate in private deals as part of my ethos.
00:05:40.300 - 00:05:52.448, Speaker A: I don't. I'm not really a fan of that. Okay, so Cosmos rot has that ethos. I fully understand that. I'm not going to get all the airdrops. Right. Maybe I miss some criteria, that's fine.
00:05:52.448 - 00:06:29.324, Speaker A: But if I can just capture, let's say, 25% to 50% of all airdrops that happen to t stakers, then I'll be golden financially, in my opinion. And if you think about it, l one and l two tokens command a premium in the market in crypto. There really aren't that many killer apps, right? Like, you know, like, yeah, there's, like, no apps. I mean, there's uniswap and whatnot, but, you know, there's, like, uniswap alternatives. There's, like, no single app that exists in crypto where if it goes to zero, I mean, you know, the entire world is going to collapse, right? I mean, that's not really how it's going to go. Of course, if lido collapses, then, you know, all the crypto degens and the crypto people, they're going to get wrecked. I mean, myself included.
00:06:29.324 - 00:06:53.844, Speaker A: But it's not really going to cause some economic doom or anything. It's just that some 20 to 40 year olds are going to just lose a bunch of their life savings, which, I mean, I'm not hoping for that. But if you think about it, there's no real killer use cases more apps in crypto. So as a result, people just buy infrastructure, whether it be l one tokens, l two tokens. Solana makes no money. But, hey, people are building on Solana, and at some point, they can capture some fees and value. Cool.
00:06:53.844 - 00:07:20.922, Speaker A: It's everything in crypto, or most things in crypto, is a growth narrative. So that's kind of how all these or all these infra tokens have such a premium over, let's say, app tokens. So, you know, let's think about this. So we see this narrative taking form. This is a narrative. It really doesn't matter what the price of Ti is and the valuation, because the airdrops will more than make up for it. I realized this not that early, because, I mean, I've talked about this before.
00:07:20.922 - 00:07:44.710, Speaker A: Like, I missed out on the celestial drop, not. I mean, I got it, but I couldn't figure out how to claim it. And I just, like Washington, you know, like, I'm too lazy, right? Because I wasn't really thinking at the time. And I think this last year drop, if I did claim it, would be worth like $20 to $30,000 or like, whatever. It's a lot of money, right? Five, like, low to mid five figures. And I know, like, it's easy for me to be like, oh, like, I missed out. I hate this token.
00:07:44.710 - 00:08:22.430, Speaker A: But then I reevaluated the project and the token, and I'm like, you know what? Like, it really doesn't matter right now. And you can kind of see why this has all the telltale signs of a bubble. So, you know, one of the reasons I'm making this video is because, well, I think this is going to happen for these reasons. And I want people to be aware of it, because in crypto, like, it's really hard to try to understand why these things have such a high valuation, but trying to, I guess, figure out why or, you know, trying to understand, like, the reasons for why these things happen might allow you to better navigate the markets. Of course, I am not like a wizard. I can't predict the markets, right. I'm not a psychic.
00:08:22.430 - 00:08:46.636, Speaker A: I can just only make a educated bets and hope they pan out. So that's the idea. So, for example, my dimension airdrop, it already covers my cost basis for Tia. So I staked Tia a bunch of wallets. I got dym a bunch of wallets. And, I mean, at the time of writing, the price on Doim was $4. Now there seems to be buyers.
00:08:46.636 - 00:09:02.018, Speaker A: Now it's trading at dollar five. I'm pretty bullish this project. Not because I got the error. I mean, that's part of it, too. But I do think that, know, if you're bullish, Celestia, you kind of have to be bullish. Dimension is kind of the idea, but, you know, that's going to be a topic for a whole nother discussion. But, yeah, I mean, I.
00:09:02.018 - 00:09:32.810, Speaker A: I bought Celestia at $13, right? The valuation makes no sense. But it doesn't matter because I got this airdrop and not, like, now I two x'ed or I'm like, more than two x, because Celestia is up and dimension probably goes up. But, you know, that's kind of idea, right? The valuation doesn't matter because all these free tokens in the future are going to make me more money. That's kind of the narrative around Celestia and why it's been literally upon me upon. Look at that. It's, like, absolutely ridiculous. So that's one of the narrative.
00:09:32.810 - 00:10:25.230, Speaker A: And, you know, I've talked about dimension in the past. I'm not going to get into it because I don't want this video to get too long. But, you know, the idea is, if you think about monolithic and modular blockchains, monolithic is like Solana, where it's one chain that does all. It's an integrated chain, and the modular separates out execution, settlement and data availability. So celestia is really good at data availability, and it's better than Ethereum at that, or at least that's narrative. And then dimension is going to just be really good at settlement, right? So, you know, if, like, should the settlement layer be worth more than the data availability layer? It could be, right? Like, I mean, the thing is, no one actually knows, and that's part of the bubble, because no one really knows how to value these things. And if staking these tokens get you more airdrops, then why should it matter? Of course, at some point, it will matter, and that's why these bubbles just go crazy, and then this crashes down.
00:10:25.230 - 00:10:59.740, Speaker A: Anyways, with the airdrop narrative, you can see that this is a very reflexive cycle. The higher price goes, the stronger the narrative is. And the stronger, sorry, the higher the price of tia goes, it should technically drive up the price of dym as well, right? Because if I. Well, if celestia is worth, let's say, like, $19 billion, is dym at $5 billion, is that fairly valued? Right? Like, what if celestia goes to 30? Then maybe Dym should go to ten. I'm not predicting these things. I have no idea. But I'm just like, this is how market psychology works.
00:10:59.740 - 00:11:44.516, Speaker A: And as more and more airdrops happen, and we see these success stories of the dimension airdrop or other airdrops, we should see more demand to buy and stake tia for future airdrops. And this is the number of unique delegators. So, like, the number of wallets staking, I suppose. And it's just like, when the slope just, like, increased here, that's when the dimension claims happen. The snapshot was taken here, and no one, I mean, I thought that would be, like, bullish, but, I mean, it didn't really change anything. And then I guess now, once people started to claim, it's like, oh, wow, it's real. And then people are, like, foboing in and understand that for all cosmos chains, if you stake with a validator, there's a 21 day unstaking period.
00:11:44.516 - 00:12:27.792, Speaker A: So you can't just stake an unstake next day. If you want to unstake, you have to wait 21 days. So that also locks up part of the circulating supply. So more airdrops, more demand for Tia, more, I guess, staking demand for TiA, and then more supply gets locked up, so it becomes a more illiquid, I guess, market, which might drive prices higher really quickly or drive prices lower really quickly. And then there's people, like, speculating on perps on centralized exchanges, but I don't understand why they're doing that, because if you're just logging stuff on exchanges, then you're not going to be getting air drops. But whatever. Tsaking also fits my thesis, because I do think that the Alt L1 trade comes back this cycle.
00:12:27.792 - 00:13:00.278, Speaker A: I'm not saying ethereum is dead, but, you know, going back to this tweet, I kind of expected Eden L2s to establish a bigger moat and lead from other Alt l one since the end of the bull, which was the last bull, which was November 2021. But if you think about it, I mean, arbitram, optimism, they look the exact same. Sure. Like, the tech might get better. There's vip 4844, but generally, I mean, the apps are the same, and, you know, zksync. Right? Tons of VC's piled money into Zksync. And then the number one TVL project is sync swap, right? It's literally sync swap.
00:13:00.278 - 00:13:24.860, Speaker A: And yes, TVL is not that important of a metric, but it's more of, like, this light bulb moment of, like. Yeah, like ethereum. L two s. It's like, not much has changed, right? If you think about it. Okay, I have to go down here and see. So me, right? I. There's kind of like this meme right now where I'm a mid curve, right? I represent 68% of the population, and I'm a mid curve, and I'm okay being a mid curve.
00:13:24.860 - 00:14:08.620, Speaker A: That's totally fine with me. And then I'm like, okay, if I'm a mid curve, then do I really want to buy l one? Like sui aptos, Solana say all these new tickers and just hope that I make the right bet this cycle? No, if I'm a mid curve, I might as well as a stake tia and get all these airdrops. And then some I'll hold to zero sum. I'll hold to infinity, some I'll sell, and it'll just pump the valhalla, and I'll feel bad. It's kind of like a comforting narrative, right? If you think about the friction of buying tia, there's not that much friction, right? Because it's like, oh, well, like, you know, I like crypto. I'm going to hold something for, like, two years. I don't know what to hold.
00:14:08.620 - 00:14:21.378, Speaker A: Bitcoin. E ten Solana. Oh, man. Tia. You know, it's, like, pretty easy to enter, like, the trade because it's a good narrative. It's a very, very simple narrative. It's very psychologically comfortable.
00:14:21.378 - 00:14:45.166, Speaker A: You have to think about this type of stuff. And also, I'm seeing parallels in the Solana and the cosmos thesis. So Solana obviously is doing really well. It's trading almost $100. People thought they were dead, but they're not dead. Builders have continued to build despite FTX and SPF and all that drama. And now their efforts are paying off.
00:14:45.166 - 00:15:06.862, Speaker A: And similarly, you know, like, these cosmos chains, they've raised tons of money from vc's they've been building throughout the bear market. They're not really good at marketing, right? Because they're just devs. They just, like, build stuff and then they ship stuff. They don't really communicate with, like, regular people. They don't really know how to talk to normies. And I think I had a tweet. Oh, yeah, there you go.
00:15:06.862 - 00:15:51.272, Speaker A: So, you know, like, one of the problem with the cosmos eco is that, you know, the devs are high iq below eqdeende, and they don't really know how to market or talk to regular people. And that's why I think, you know, this is why teams should just airdrop to everybody, right? Just let this devs can focus on Devin and then give something like five to 10% of the supply to people and then let the community create a narrative. And we're already seeing this happen, right? For example, like, dimension, right? Like, if you just look up this dym ticker on Twitter, like, there's so many discussions happening on, like, why this thing should be worth, like, $100 billion or something, right? It's absolutely ridiculous. But, I mean, it's happening. And then the token dime, right? There's this meme already. It's called diamond hands, right? Like, I mean, surely the Dimension team didn't come up with this. It's the community that got the airdrop.
00:15:51.272 - 00:16:11.752, Speaker A: And they're like, you know what? Like, that's a good meme, right? We are diamond hands. That's pretty good, right? And then dime is money. Time is money. Dime is money. That's pretty good. And then, you know, saga, right? I mean, this is kind of a joke, right? It's kind of a joke. But Saga had this really, really, you know, very stingy airdrop criteria where they took a snapshot on December 1.
00:16:11.752 - 00:16:58.010, Speaker A: So basically, under, like, under a month before or, sorry, I believe, like, Celestia launched, like, early November, and then the snapshot was taken, like, under a month, right? Since the token went live, I mean, there's, like, no way that there's a strong celestia community on December 1 right now. It's starting to form. So, like, what are they doing, right? The team just wanted to keep all the supply. The VC's just didn't want to give it to, like, people like you and I. And I'm like, yeah, like, what the hell, right? Like, I did not qualify to airdrop therefore I will fud saga whenever it goes live, right? I have nothing against team, right? But I think that if we want to foster this culture and this is already happening, right? It's like if you give me a neo drop, I love your project and I will blow post it. If you don't give me a neural job, then it's going to zero, right? That's kind of like the crypto mentality. And I think developers shouldn't mid curve this.
00:16:58.010 - 00:17:48.094, Speaker A: They should just give away tokens to as many people as possible. Let the just reward the community, because that's how communities form. And then, you know, one of the promises I made is, or like, I'm going to try to get all these teams to airdrop. I mean, like, why? Why shouldn't they, right? And then Manta, they just introduced, or did they just like discuss like, I guess, the airdrop criteria and like the token supply and whatnot, you know, yada, yada, yada. And then in a Twitter spaces last week, they were like, oh yeah, we'll reward the Celestia stakers. And then it doesn't contain the Celestia stakers. I'm like, what did they lie to us? And you can see that lots of views, right? People are like, people are pissed, right? And I mean, if they did lie to us, then that's very, very bearish, right? I will actually fud them if they lied to us because that's awful, right? They raised $60 million from VC's at half a billion dollar valuation.
00:17:48.094 - 00:18:14.808, Speaker A: And now they're out here lying to the community. That's unacceptable. Maybe, maybe, right? Maybe as part of ecosystem community, they'll give some airdrops distributed through governance. Maybe a couple months in, they'll be like, okay, like, like, let's give 2% to the TL stakers because we love the tio community. Yeah. Then we're happy. I'm like, yeah, that's great, right? Manta's first Zkebm L two, using celestia for da.
00:18:14.808 - 00:18:43.590, Speaker A: I mean, that's the future of finance, right? So there's always a community element when it comes to crypto. And if you also think about it, like, why did ohm get so big? Because there was a strong community of three, three ers and nine niners. And you know, like if you fud Ohm on the Internet, then pitchforks come out. It's definitely a cult. And that's how bubbles form, right? There has to be a cult element. There has to be a community element. There has to be like this lockup supply to, like, get more tokens kind of element.
00:18:43.590 - 00:19:09.528, Speaker A: And that's kind of, you know what I'm alluding to. But, you know, like, you know, Celeste is Cosmos SDK, you know, like, it's in the cosmos ecosystem. So if cosmos does have a renaissance, like, sauna, then it should also benefit. But, I mean, I've kind of alluded to this, but let's talk about, like, why this is, like, the 33. Let me kind of zoom in so you can kind of. Okay, so right here. Right? Like, what makes this a 33 of the cycle? This is gonna be the progression, in my opinion.
00:19:09.528 - 00:19:41.670, Speaker A: First, the market sees figaro drops. I mean, you know, like, if this thing trades at $5, like, literally, if you staked one tia, like, one unit of Tia, like, $20, you got 200 tokens, right? Like, you stake $20 to get $1,000. I mean, that's pretty ridiculous, right? That's pretty ridiculous. So, you know, markets see these big airdrops, and who knows? Maybe the token goes up, and it's like, then the more. Then the eth Max community and, like, the other non cosmos believer community will be like, wow. Like, wow. The cosmos ecosystem is kind of cooking, right? It's cooking, right? There's.
00:19:41.670 - 00:20:10.972, Speaker A: There's stuff going on there, and then they're like, you know, more hype can happen. And then, you know, we see that I mentioned Airdrop. There's a soccer airdrop, the Manta airdrop, hopefully, right? If they didn't lie to us, and then, you know, there's more and more airdrops. And if you just follow Celestia on Twitter, like, every single week, there's a couple projects that announces that they're using Celestia for Da. And if the narrative is that Celestia makes it easier for. To, like, I guess, launch new roll ups, then we should expect hundreds of roll ups. Maybe 99 of them go to zero.
00:20:10.972 - 00:20:42.390, Speaker A: But, like, all you need is one airdrop, right? That's kind of like the psychographic. And then people dream about the size of these airdrops, and then, you know, if you kind of do this mental model or mental math in your head, buyers become more and more price inset, price insensitive because of airdrop expectations. I'll be honest, I have no idea how to value this thing, but I think the market is valuing Tia with this generic function. Okay? Valuation equals future value. Cruel to the data availability layer. I have no idea what that is. Mimetics.
00:20:42.390 - 00:21:45.390, Speaker A: I mean, that's very fluffy narrative, right? I have no idea and the future expectations of airdrops, the TA stakers, right? If you stake $1,000 at a Tia and you get more than thousand dollars, then, like, why should you care what the valuation is? So naturally? Because the first three points is kind of fluffy, and the fourth one is the only one we can kind of cling on to. That's what, you know, the human brain just clings on the simple things because we don't over complicate things. So, you know. Yeah, who cares, right? And then I don't really know who this guy is. Like, nothing against this guy, but I actually took this from Jordy Alexander, one of his articles. And, you know, it's like this, like, last cycle, in 2021, we had like, Olympus Dao Wonderland and like, all these, like, forks promising like billions and gajillions of APIs. And I mean, like, at the time it was crazy, right? Like, I go on YouTube and there's like, all these new zoomers and new youtubers I've never heard of with tens of thousands of views talking about all these own forks, I'm like, wow, people really love this stuff.
00:21:45.390 - 00:22:30.448, Speaker A: But it's a pretty, I mean, it's a good narrative, right? Because trading is hard, investing is very, very hard. So if there's an asset where you can just buy and stake, and no matter what price does, you'll make money. I mean, why wouldn't people like that? Of course, in the case of Olympus style, in the forks, the APY is being paid out in the token. So if the token goes to zero, then the API is zero, and then whatever money you put in goes to zero. So people figure that out eventually. And this narrative of if the APY is so high that you can enter later and make a lot money regardless of the price, I mean, that's not how math works, right? I. Price of home can go down 99% and you'll be okay because the API will make up for it.
00:22:30.448 - 00:22:54.768, Speaker A: Now's the narrative. And now the narrative. And I'm not saying that, you know, this is the right narrative, but this is what's happening, right? As market participants. Like, we can't just project our opinions on the market. We just have to observe the market for what it is and understand why prices are moving. And right now, people are saying it doesn't matter because airdrops will make up for it. And how can people disagree? I mean, the dimension airdrop is, it's a big one, right? It's a really big one.
00:22:54.768 - 00:23:27.484, Speaker A: And if you're an early part of the Celestia community, then chances are, like, you're up 2345 x, right? Pretty crazy. Completely different project. Celestia. Amazing technological innovation. Like, amazing ohm, you know, not, not like nothing compared to Celestia, but the narrative has similarities and it has the characteristics. Characteristics of a future bubble. And also, like, what creates bubbles, right? What creates bubbles is if I guess, like retail, like piles into the trade, right? I mean, like, to put it bluntly, right? I mean, I'm retail.
00:23:27.484 - 00:23:59.790, Speaker A: We're all retail in the grand scheme of things. We're all just doing the best we can and, you know, we have to deal with the results. But I mean, I run a YouTube channel. I see the metrics, I see the views and the numbers. And the one thing I've realized is that retail just loves airdrops. And, like, why, like, why, why shouldn't they, right? The promise of turning like $100 into like hundred thousand dollars sounds amazing. And, you know, I mean, I'm not really, like, attacking these youtubers because, I mean, I make, I mean, I'm literally making a celestia video, right? So, like, I'm part of the problem, I suppose.
00:23:59.790 - 00:24:37.490, Speaker A: But I mean, like, I'm just trying to provide a market commentary. And I'm telling you that, I mean, this is a bubble, right? We're in this bubble. I have no idea how it's gonna go, but I mean, it is gonna be a bubble, right? That's kind of my observation. And even like my channel, right, it's like, I have these podcasts and they do pretty well. I had Ansemon, right, like the main character, 21,000 views. But like, you know, like this ultimate Cosmos and Celestia Airdrop farming Guy 2024 has 24,000 views, right? People just love airdrops. And then, you know, I, like, I make some book review video with 4000 views, and then I'm like, oh, like dimension and Manta Airdrop updates, 9.4
00:24:37.490 - 00:24:59.362, Speaker A: thousand views. Just people gravitate towards airdrop content. And if people demand airdrop content, then it's natural for crypto YouTubers and TikTokers to just create airdrop content. That's how it works. And that's also a reflexive cycle when it comes to attention. So, you know, the other youtubers I talked about is like crypto Cove. I don't really do tutorials.
00:24:59.362 - 00:25:31.604, Speaker A: I let other people do it, right? So if you want to maybe shout out to this guy, I mean, okay, like, let's, let's talk about this, right? You go down here, bungie, refuel tutorial, 154 views. Know stake 20. Tia turn 200 into $10,000. 23,000 views. Right? And now he's becoming, like, this airdrop farming guru guide. There's nothing wrong with that, right? I mean, I'm, like, very useful content. Like, good job, right? I mean, he's adjusting to the market environment, you know, like, very short, simple, easy to great.
00:25:31.604 - 00:25:49.380, Speaker A: Good stuff, right? Crypto cove. Good stuff. Miles, right? This guy's a grinder, right? I really respect the hustle. And, you know, it's like, yeah, like, airdrops. Airdrops. Airdrops, right? Turn 100 into 18k. You know, like, I don't know if that's possible, but, I mean, it could be, like, how? How can I? I mean, literally, you could have turned $20 into $1,000.
00:25:49.380 - 00:26:13.660, Speaker A: So, like, what am I supposed to say, right? I mean, yeah, it's possible, I guess, you know, dynamo defi, right? Also, Patrick, he's a good guy. You know how to bridge to Metis. 900 views. Cosmos airdrop guide with insane potential. 26,000 views. People just love airdrops. And, I mean, if you're a trader, like, you have to keep track of this stuff, right? You can't just go on Twitter and be like, this is good tech.
00:26:13.660 - 00:26:50.314, Speaker A: This tech is gonna pump, right? Like, that's not how it works. It's more like, okay, like, what do people care about? And, like, what are they gonna buy? And, like, objectively, I mean, the data says that people just love airdrop farming, and then they're gonna go. I mean, that's part of the reason why Solana is doing, right? Because there's so many airdrops, and I'm sure, like, you know, like, eigen layer and, like, ethereum based airdrops will also do well. But, I mean, this. This is the meta, right? This meta. And, yes, like, you know, I'm also making these videos. Like, but the thing is, like, all my t has staked, okay? I literally can't sell, right? So, like, I'm not, like, making this video because I wanted to go up and, like, I can, like, dump my.
00:26:50.314 - 00:27:14.870, Speaker A: No, like, I mean, I'm not gonna sell, and I'll talk about what I'm doing later as part, like, you know, as, like, the final part. But, you know, like, I'm just saying. I'm just calling a spade a spade. You know, it's just like, is it too late? I mean, I personally don't think it's too late. I mean, I still have my tsaaked, right? So, like, I don't think it's too late. Celestial, like, literally launched two months ago. And, like, the, like, think that the airdrop narrative just, like, is over.
00:27:14.870 - 00:27:51.180, Speaker A: Doesn't make sense to me, right? If you think that Celestia is, like, actually like, a very, very legit project, there will be a time, right, if Celestia hits some crazy valuation. And as these airdrops get diluted over time, there will be a point where it's not going to be worth it. And I think that's when the bubble is going to deflate. And just because Tia is a very legit project doesn't make it immune from bubbles. In fact, the more legit stuff might make it more likely to create bubbles, right? Because, you know, like, it's easier to buy something that's more legit. People are tired of the scams in crypto, right? So if they're going to pile into something, it better be, you know, better be legit. Like outside of meme coins, of course.
00:27:51.180 - 00:28:24.952, Speaker A: And if you see this bubble forming, then a profit driven individual trader, investor, whatever, right? If you identify this, then why not participate? That's not irrational. You can view something as a bubble and then still participate because you think the bubble is going to get bigger. That's totally fine. George Soros famous quote, when I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy adding fuel to the fire. That's not irrational. And that's why we need regulators to counteract the market when the bubble is starting to grow too big. So in this case, maybe the regulators are going to be, I don't know.
00:28:24.952 - 00:29:06.354, Speaker A: You know, like, maybe someone makes, like, an anti airdrop Sybil attack, right? Which kind of kills the bubble, and then it go, like, allows tia to get to a, like, much more, like fair value. But, like, who am I to say that Tia is not undervalued, right? I mean, you know, like, it's kind of competing with Ethereum. Like, you know, ethereum is like a couple hundred million dollar mark you have in a way. So, you know, like, who am I to say it's not like it shouldn't be worth more? I mean, I don't know, right? Like, I'm a mid curve, right? Literally, I'm a mid curve. So, you know, a mid curve does what a mid curve does, and I just submit to mid curve narratives. Oh, man. Okay.
00:29:06.354 - 00:29:49.840, Speaker A: I'm also writing this to remind myself in the future to be humble and take profits, even if the narrative feels indestructible. The higher price, the higher the price goes, the better the narrative is. I mean, if you liked Celestia at $3, you'll love it at $9, right? And if you loved at $9, you'll love it at $18, and you'll love it at. If it keeps going higher, then there's, let's say, okay, let's do this. If someone's buying Celestia at $19, they're doing it because they expected to get, like, $38 or like, whatever, right, where, like, the airdrop is gonna be worth it. And then if someone buys at $38, then expect it to go to $76. And then if they buy at 76, then they expect it to go to, like, 200, and then if they.
00:29:49.840 - 00:30:53.184, Speaker A: If people buy at 200, then they expect to go to 1000, and then it's like, oh, like, oh, you know, like, I have no idea. Okay, I drew this in 30 seconds, but, and, okay, like, this chart, okay, like, this has, like, no pullbacks, right? Like, I'm not saying that there's gonna be no pullbacks, but, you know, I kind of generally expect, like, Tia to just go up a lot, and then at some point it's going to just come back down just because at some point, it's not going to make sense, like, buy and stake. So for that reason, right, Iftia is the purest, is the purest way to play the airdrop narrative, I think it's going to be an amazing bull market hold and a very, very painful bear market hold. People are going to unwind, right, once they realize that the valuation doesn't make sense, even if they expect more airdrops and people make, like, a 1020 30 x, at some point people will sell, right? And then there's gonna be a bunch of supply VC's, like, team and vc unlocks happen, I believe, November of next year. So maybe people start unwinding before then. Honestly, I have no idea. Okay.
00:30:53.184 - 00:31:25.710, Speaker A: It kind of just depends on how strong the airdrop narrative is. But understand that, you know, there's a 21 day unbonding period. So, like, the moment you realize that it's, like, over, you have to wait 21 days, and then that's gonna just create, like, more and more sellers on the way down, I think. And, you know, it's gonna be a brutal, brutal thing to hold, I think. And I think, you know, eventually, I think it will, like, you know, base out and go higher just because I think Tia is an amazing project. But, you know, that that's besides the point. So what's the plan? I am staying at Tia.
00:31:25.710 - 00:31:39.930, Speaker A: Okay. Like, I'll hold some airdrops I'll sell some airdrops. When do I sell? I don't know. Okay. Like, the point of a bubble is that it can go much higher than you expect, and it can go much lower than you expect. My current plan, I mean. Okay, so this is.
00:31:39.930 - 00:32:11.480, Speaker A: I wrote this January 13. I'm making this video January 16. If you're watching this video, like, February or March or April, look, my opinions might have changed. Okay? Just understand that I changed my mind pretty often. You know, like, one day I'm bullish, and next day I'm like, yeah, you know what? Like, I'd rather hold that thing, and then I sell. So just, you know, like, if you're watching, if you're reading content and it's, like, old, like, you know, just be open minded to the idea that this guy could have changed his mind, right. Especially in crypto, because it's so volatile.
00:32:11.480 - 00:32:46.856, Speaker A: Things change so fast. It's like, you know, like, what am I supposed to do, right? I can't just, you know, make videos every time I sell, like, 5% of my stack. Like, that makes no sense. Yeah, I don't have time for that. But my current plan is to start unwinding my positions once Coinbase is the number one app on the app store. That's been a pretty good indicator of when things are getting super frothy, because think about it. If coinbase is the number one finance app, then who is left to download it? At that point, it's pretty nuts.
00:32:46.856 - 00:33:15.612, Speaker A: Or when majors are hitting all time high. So if it hits 70k, ether hits, like, five k, then I'm like, you know what? Like, you know, it's probably gonna go higher, but I don't care, right? I'm just gonna start the 21 day unbonding process, you know? Because the idea isn't for me to sell everything at the top. It's to just manage risk and hopefully sell at a good price. Right? That's, like, all I can do. So, yeah, you know, I can also be wrong, right? I've been wrong many times. Right? Just go. I don't delete my YouTube videos.
00:33:15.612 - 00:33:35.620, Speaker A: You can just go down and watch all the content. I made some coins I've done really well on. Some coins I've done horribly on. So, like, what that. I mean, yeah, like, I'm a mid curve, right? I'm literally part of the 68%. So, like, what the hell do I know? That's kind of zoom out here. That's kind of my take on this.
00:33:35.620 - 00:34:12.180, Speaker A: You know? I think Celestia is an amazing project. I think you're going to see hundreds of roll ups launch this year using Celestia for Daevdev. And, yeah, some will airdrop, some won't. That's fine. But if you understand, I guess, like, why it's going up, then you might be able to better understand or navigate the markets and also. Right, like this type of price action and this type of, you know, market dynamic, this only exists in crypto, right? So hopefully. Right, like, whether this does or doesn't play out, I hope you learned something about, like, why things happen.
00:34:12.180 - 00:34:59.241, Speaker A: And of course, this is very, very specific to Tia. Of course. And maybe dimension, right? It's like maybe Celestia becomes three three and dimension becomes 99, right? Because you get the Tia airdrop, you stake it. You get the diameter drop, you stake it, and then you stake everything. It's like nine nine, right? And I understand people get upset when they hear three, three or 99 because it's like PTSD. But I'm only using these terms because it's familiar for people. So it's like the idea clicks better, right? Instead of like, you know, calling Celestia 33 is a much simpler way to get this idea across than to call Celestia, like, the modular money that brings you airdrops to, like, the mono.
00:34:59.241 - 00:35:25.332, Speaker A: The modular thesis to kill all monolithic thesis to. They thrown ethereum as the global settlement layer. Like, what the. What the fuck? Right? That's gonna be it for me. It's a longer video, but I think, I mean, I had some fun recording this, so hopefully this was pretty interesting. Anyways, I'm gonna put this thread into the description below. You can kind of read through it.
00:35:25.332 - 00:35:50.752, Speaker A: You know, if you look at my, quote tweets in my comment section, there's like some really angry people. But, you know, it's like, what can I do, right? It's people on the Internet, they're angry, right? They're very angry. But hopefully you guys enjoyed. Please like and subscribe, leave a comment what you think, and check out the premium discord.
