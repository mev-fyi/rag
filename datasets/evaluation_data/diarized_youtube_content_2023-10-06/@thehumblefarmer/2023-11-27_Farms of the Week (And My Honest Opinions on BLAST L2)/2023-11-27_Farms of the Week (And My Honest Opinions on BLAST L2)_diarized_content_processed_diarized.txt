00:00:00.800 - 00:00:32.802, Speaker A: What is up guys? Humble farmer taiki here and I'm back with farms of the week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and check out the premium discord link will be in the description below. The first thing I do have to talk about is blast the L2 backed by paradigm and other influencers. And I will be honest, when I first saw this thing I was pretty disgusted, but I did change my tune. I do want to give my honest opinions because I think there's a lot of emotions when it comes to this type of topic. But I want to lay out the facts and I guess see if it's worth farming or not. So let's talk about like the negative side.
00:00:32.802 - 00:01:01.696, Speaker A: Okay, so when blast was first announced they raised $20 million on paradigm. Yada yada yada. It's the L2 with native yield and I think the point where a lot of people got mad is looking at the people that invested. It's like the same names over and over again. They don't really participate in the liquid markets. All they do is participate in private deals, get rich and they just profit off of having followers. I mean, I'll be honest, most of these people, I'm friendly with them.
00:01:01.696 - 00:01:48.450, Speaker A: I think they're not bad people. But if they have this opportunity to get in into blast at a 200 million dollar market cap or FDR, whatever the valuation was, I think it makes sense for them to participate. It's just really upsetting from a liquid market participator's perspective because what are we supposed to do? Another new airdrop farm backed by paradigm and influencers? As a liquid market participator I have no choice but to farm this thing. It's also tiresome and you can kind of get the sentiment because I wrote a bullish piece on it which I will talk about. And as soon as I wrote this I got a lot of hate. And there's accounts like this. If you watch timeline closely you can see paradigm handing out influencer allocations in real time because initially I kind of gave them shit for it.
00:01:48.450 - 00:02:22.822, Speaker A: It's like, what the hell is going on? There's a three month withdrawal lockup. Lmao. And then I post something bullish and people automatically assume that I like I invested where I got some free tokens. So first of all, I will say this is an important topic of mine because you know, my channel and when I first started this channel, I started out with an ethos and there were a lot of problems with crypto youtubers, crypto Twitter influencers and I wanted to do something different. And the first thing I pledged to do was to not run ads on my channel. You can kind of see here, I don't run ads. I don't run YouTube ads.
00:02:22.822 - 00:02:51.142, Speaker A: You know, like just nothing, right? Just nothing. Because I want to focus on quality, not quantity, and not really doing like, click baity stuff. Second, I don't have sponsors. I don't do paid promotions, and I don't really have centralized exchange reflinks, okay. Because I want to just make good content. Second of all I wrote about this here is, you know, I'm the founder of a defi company. I have a personal mandate to not participate in seed or angel deals, aka the private markets.
00:02:51.142 - 00:03:35.212, Speaker A: If I'm posting research about the liquid markets, there's a conflict of interest if I'm getting rich on private deals, okay? So, I mean, technically I do have the opportunity to participate in these influencer deals. I just choose not to because I think, you know, or, you know, just ethics, right? So let's just get that out of the way and just understand that I have no vested interest in this. I just like, want to, I guess, pitch this form to you and you can figure out if you want to, you know, participate or not. So the idea is you can bridge to this layer too, and you can kind of see it, right? This is blast, and I'll put the link in the description below. And you can bridge and you can get points. So far, I've only bridged 0.18. You can kind of see here, and I have 1800.1800
00:03:35.212 - 00:04:13.742, Speaker A: points. I'm not even going to post my referral link because that's how much I don't care, okay, about making rich, like getting rich off of like, you know, YouTube videos and whatnot. So the idea is, let's go back to my post here. You know, there's a lot of market inefficiencies when it comes to these L2s. And in this bullish post, I highlighted the fact that, for example, the Arbitrum bridge has $2.5 billion in the bridge contract. So if you wanted to bridge arbitrum, you go on Ethereum mainnet, you give the bridge ether, and then in return, the Arbitrum bridge will give you like a receipt token of the ether.
00:04:13.742 - 00:04:52.688, Speaker A: And if you're on a bridge back, then, you know, you the receipt token and get the ETH in return on the other side. But the ether is just sitting there, okay? There's $2.5 billion worth of value just sitting there, not being staked if all this ETH were staked, earning 4%, hypothetically, with Lido and whatnot, it would mean that arbitrum could be making $100 million in ETH per year, and they could technically give this yield back to arbitrum token holders. They probably won't, right? They'll probably keep all the profits, but they technically could. And similarly, you can say the same thing about stablecoin bridges. People send stable coins to a bridge and it's just sitting there. But, you know, like, there's a market inefficiency.
00:04:52.688 - 00:05:45.294, Speaker A: For example, tether, right? They take all your, like, if you mint tether, you give them USD, they mint USDT, and with all the backing, they just put it all into t bills, earning 5%, and then they make a billion dollars every single quarter. It's a very profitable business. And blast just says, you know, like, why don't we just stake all the stable coins, why don't we just stake all the ether and then just give out, like, give out that yield to its users? I think on the surface it's a good idea. And objectively, right, I think if blast didn't have all these, like, influencer investors, I think people would welcome it. But I just think the fact, you know, it's just controversial because, you know, like, oh my God, like, all these influencers are going to be making so much money. I hate this idea, which I totally understand, but from a farming perspective, all you have to do is send ether, stablecoins to this contract. There is a three to four month lockup.
00:05:45.294 - 00:06:22.186, Speaker A: So if you send ETH over, there's no way to bridge back. So I think if you think rationally, if you have ether or if you have stables that you're not going to touch for three to four months, I think it's worth bridging. Because, I mean, if you're going to, it's kind of like a forced diamond hands, right? Because I mean, all the ETH is going to be stick with lido. So it's earning 3.6%, I believe, right now, and all the stable coins are going to be earning 5%. So you're already earning the native yield of like stable coins and ether. And then I think by, like May or April of next year, we'll be getting some blast tokens.
00:06:22.186 - 00:06:44.480, Speaker A: And like I mentioned, right, I only bridged 0.1. Whoops. What the hell did it do? Hold up. Okay, I only bridge point one EtH over. You can kind of see here because there is an opportunity cost and there's no rush okay. And, you know, there's already half a billion dollars in here. So is it really worth farming this thing? I'm not quite sure.
00:06:44.480 - 00:07:20.370, Speaker A: I'm still thinking about it because it's interesting because I think a lot of layer ones and l two s, they're valuation models. It's somewhat correlated with TVL, right? So if people bridge more and more funds over to blast, then the implied valuation of blast goes up. And if the implied valuation of blast goes up, it makes more sense to bridge because, you know, you'll be getting, like, some blast tokens and it's gonna be worth more. And it's pretty reflexive. So, you know, as more and more people bridge, it increases the implied valuation of blast. And then if the implied valuation of blast goes up, then more people bridge. And then you kind of have this loop.
00:07:20.370 - 00:07:54.176, Speaker A: But, you know, just understand the fact that if you have, like, if you send money over, then it's impossible. Or, you know, you can't bridge it back. Or, I mean, you can't get it back for four months. I try not to say bridge because there is no bridge, but, you know, I still get, I still kind of get in this trouble. And it's pretty crazy because there's this market on Evo. So they just pre launched futures of blast, the L2. And they just assumed that, okay, for simplicity, let's assume that a billion tokens are going to be in the supply for simplicity, and then people can trade what they think is worth.
00:07:54.176 - 00:08:27.952, Speaker A: So if you buy this blast token for a dollar and it ends up having like a $5 million fdv at launch, then you'll be able to sell it for $5 if you wanted to. So it's like this very illiquid market that allows people to speculate on the future valuation of blast. And right now, let me refresh this, actually, because this number always changes. And no, this is kind of dumb, to be honest, because it's so illiquid. If you look at the 24 hours volume, it's $36,000. So there's no one trading this, okay? But right now it's roughly 4.34.5, like whatever the price is.
00:08:27.952 - 00:08:59.060, Speaker A: So the implied valuation is $4.5 billion. And it is kind of dumb because there is no L2, okay? They're just promising that there is going to be something. And crypto degens just gave them 500 something million dollars, which is kind of nuts. But from a farming perspective, if you just think about it from an expected value perspective, if you have, let's say, 510. Eat that. You're just going to hold no matter what, and you're not going to sell in the next four months.
00:08:59.060 - 00:09:34.504, Speaker A: Then why not just bridge some over and then maybe in four months you'll get a few hundred dollars, or maybe if you're lucky, a few thousand dollars with the free blast tokens and you can just dump it in the open market and either, right, it gets staked. If you send stables, it's earning 5%. So there's little opportunity cost. The only opportunity cost is if you send, like, all your stable coins over to this and then a crazy bull market happens and you want to buy stuff, then you won't be able to because it's just stuck here. So that's the only risk. And for that reason, I only bridged 0.18. Okay, I might bridge more later, but just to start out, I bridged 0.18.
00:09:34.504 - 00:09:52.004, Speaker A: It gave me like, 1800 points. And there's a lot of, like, gamification involved. There's like this, you know, squad reward. I don't even know what this is. This isn't even. I mean, it kind of gives, like, this allure of, like, slots or something. We all know this is, like, fake, right? I mean, everyone gets like, you know, like a good look figure.
00:09:52.004 - 00:10:11.132, Speaker A: It's, you know, it's. It's just gamification. It gets people to, like, come back to this website. It's very, very smart, I think. And the developer, Pac Man, I think he's a really, really good builder. I mean, he built blur, and, I mean, yeah, I think it makes sense. So I had CEO on the podcast the cat, and I uploaded this yesterday.
00:10:11.132 - 00:10:40.848, Speaker A: And even he mentioned that, you know, it's probably not worth him personally farming this just because it's being diluted more and more. And I do think that this able market is kind of like. I mean, yeah, I mean, first of all, this isn't even real, right? And, you know, it's very illiquid. I think $4.5 billion for this is way too high. But I do think that the idea makes sense. So, going back to this original topic, let's kind of think about what types of applications can be built because there's so many L2s.
00:10:40.848 - 00:11:37.626, Speaker A: They all command these, like, crazy evaluations. But let's actually think about the applications that can be built here. So there's this project on gnosis chain called agave, and I, they kind of do the same thing, but, I mean, they did it before without, like, the airdrop firing points, but what they do is gnosis stream stakes all the die bridged into DSR, earning 5%. And if you want to earn the yield that comes from this, you can stake your dai on gnosis chain, and you know, it's earning 7.3%. So how does this work? So let's say $100 million worth of stable coins are bridged to blast, and only $50 million gets staked, and the rest is sitting in wallets or being used in defi. Cool. If $100 million is earning 5% and only $50 million is staked for yield, then users can receive 10% yield without any Ponzi mechanics, right? Because 5% of 100 is $5 million.
00:11:37.626 - 00:12:14.834, Speaker A: And if only $50 million is earning that, then it's 10% APY. There's no leverage. There's, like, nothing crazy involved. It's just, okay, it's exploiting a market inefficiency. So if I blast, like, does it like this, then yeah, I mean, you can earn a pretty safe yield on stable coins without having to take on that much smart contract risk. The only, you know, risk you're taking is, well, like, where's the yield coming from? You know, Makerdao owns $3 billion with the short term t bills earning 5%. So, you know, you're basically relying on maker to, like, not rug, but, you know, maker has been around for, I mean, it's one of the oldest daosh.
00:12:14.834 - 00:12:56.120, Speaker A: So I guess the risk in blast is that there's an over reliance on Maker and Lido. But I also think that it's very bullish for Lido and maker because it kind of entrenches them as the most liquid leaders, or it kind of entrenches them as category leaders in the space. So that's one option of what could happen. And the second option is, let's say there's no staking and whatnot. Let's say that USDB, which is the stable coin on blast, is just paying 5% from maker, and that's flat. That alone is not that much of a compelling product. But I also mentioned that, hey, the future of finance.
00:12:56.120 - 00:13:31.366, Speaker A: Okay, maybe not the future finance, but the future of DeFi. Why are we lp eat in USDC? Why don't we farm? Like, why don't we lp, staked eat and staked die? Okay? Because staked is earning 3.6%. Staked earning 5%. Like, I mean, this is a much better product than just wet USDC. Of course there is, you know, illiquidity risk, unstaking risk and whatnot. But if you expect DeFi to grow in market cap and adoption, then, you know, like, products like this should be de risked over time. So this was always, like, part of my thesis around yield and defi.
00:13:31.366 - 00:13:58.012, Speaker A: You know, like, more and more stable coins are going to be staked with projects like Maker or Dao. More and more ETH is going to be staked with projects like Lido. I mean, it's a pretty much a no brainer. But if you think about projects like arbitrum, they're not doing this right. They just have to put $5 million. It's not doing anything. Technically, they could stake it and give it back to its own company, right? So the value accrues to the equity, or they can give it back to arbitram stakers, but we all know that they don't want to do that.
00:13:58.012 - 00:14:57.120, Speaker A: And there are complexities back then. And if you've been watching my channel, if you've been watching my videos for quite some time, I've mentioned that this is how DeFi exits the bear market. And back in July, I said that the end of the Defi bear market is upon us, and the new bull market is forming before our very eyes. And if you actually look at what I was saying in July and August, I was saying that part of the reason why TvO left the Defi ecosystem is because the Fed started raising rates. And if you can earn 5% on fidelity, why do we hold stablecoins on chain earning, like, 1%, right, with all the additional smart contract risk associated with it? So, back in July, I started to notice a trend like makerdao of these daos giving the risk free rate on chain. And I thought that this was going to help stop the bleed of the stablecoin market cap. Therefore, more money stays on chain, and more money flows on chain over time, which leads to more wealth.
00:14:57.120 - 00:15:25.682, Speaker A: And more wealth should mean that there's more buying pressure, right, more personally power amongst DeFi gens and Defi natives that will help support asset prices. And, you know, like, I don't think it's that much of a surprise. And there's. I mean, there's, like, no way for me to prove this, but it's really a coincidence that the stablecoin market cap bottomed around the time of, you know, like, the whole RWA tokenized treasury thesis. I don't think it's. I mean, I'm sure it's not one to one, but I don't think it's that off. Right.
00:15:25.682 - 00:16:00.150, Speaker A: And it's my belief that the next defi bull market is going to be led by on chain adoption of rwas and yield driven products. So if that's my thesis, if I'm bullish maker, if I'm bullish Kanto, then it's rational for me to be bullish blast, okay? It doesn't mean that I got influencer allocation. It doesn't mean that I get free tokens. No, it makes sense. This product makes sense. And I think a year, two, three years from now, I think a lot of L2s, a lot of projects are going to just look like this. And, you know, blast is just the first one to just really, you know, put it in front of our faces.
00:16:00.150 - 00:16:33.118, Speaker A: People just don't like it because of all the influencers, which I understand, right? Like, I don't like it. If I had the option, I would like, I would prefer them like, all lose their money, to be honest. Maybe what would be good for the ecosystem is like we all like, retail gets tokens, we all dump it and no one buys it back. And all these token influencers, their money is locked in, like these vesting tokens and it's worth nothing, right? But I mean, rationally speaking, I think they're all going to make money. I don't like it. You don't like it? You don't like it. But we're talking about farms here.
00:16:33.118 - 00:17:14.764, Speaker A: We're talking about farms of the week. Why not send somebody over if you're not planning to sell it is my hopefully objective take. There's a lot of like Ethereum, Maxis, decentralization, Maxis. That's like, oh, like, it's not a bridge, right? Like it's a scam, it's a multisig. I mean, yeah, but I mean, you know, like, I mean, honestly, like, you know, they're backed by paradigm. Paradigm is one of the best, like VC firms, to be honest. I think they've gone some negativity recently and, you know, I think as a result, Dan Robinson kind of, you know, said, hey, like, you know, we invested in them, but I don't really condone their actions.
00:17:14.764 - 00:18:27.232, Speaker A: You know, they kind of like just wrote three paragraphs saying that, you know, like, we don't like this, but it's like, whatever, right? Blast backed but not fully endorsed by paradigm. And I was like, oh, shit, time to bridge back. This was kind of a shitpost because I know you can't bridge back, but that's kind of how I think about blast. I think it's worth forming if you have ether that you're not going to touch because by definition, it's profitable as long as they don't rug. If you send ether over in three to four months, you get your ether back and then you get some blast tokens. If we all make a few hundred bucks, a few thousand dollars off of this, then do we really have the right to complain about these VC's seed influencers? I think there is a conflict of interest recently where, you know, influencers can just grow a following and then, you know, be paid basically to just, like, show things. But, like, what can we do, right? Like, we can all complain about it, but, like, like, what good does that do? And also, I think that a lot of people just complain because it gets engagement, right? It's really easy for, I guess, like, people to just hate on blast, and then everyone gets likes and retweets and gets engagement and it makes themselves feel better.
00:18:27.232 - 00:18:57.150, Speaker A: But from a pure monetary perspective, I think it makes sense to form this with some of your capital, if you can afford it, if you're fine with a lockup. And that's my honest opinion. Hopefully that is clear. Well, I did not expect to be talking about this for 20 minutes, but. Okay, let's do some rapid fire farms on the arbitrary ecosystem. So let's go. Okay, so, okay, so, yeah, I did talk about this here, right? Some.
00:18:57.150 - 00:19:22.150, Speaker A: Actually, yeah, I'm not going to read through this. Let's just talk about some of these arbitram driven farms. So if you go to defy llama, you look at the difference in volume, you see that there's some random protexes here. Duidx should be the market leader, but there's a vertex protocol, there's hyper liquid. What's up with that? A billion dollars of 24 hours volume. What's up with that? Let's talk about vertex first. They did a token launch.
00:19:22.150 - 00:20:03.150, Speaker A: I don't own this thing, but it's been doing pretty well. 74 million mark cap, $500 million db. But, like, where's the volume coming from? Well, right now they have arbitrum and vertex incentives where you trade, you get tokens. So there's a lot of wash trading going on, and there's a lot of cynicism when it comes to this. So, you know, for example, this is the volumes for Quinta, the perpetex on optimism. And you can kind of see that, you know, whenever there are incentives, there's a lot of people that, you know, trade on the thing, but as soon as those incentives go away, no one trades on this thing, you know? So. Yeah, so are these volumes real? Probably not.
00:20:03.150 - 00:20:56.824, Speaker A: I think most of this volume is people like, wash trading and just getting these tokens. But it doesn't mean that it's a bad project, right? Like, I mean, sure, like right now it might be fake volume and wash trading, but I mean, if the project is good and people end up, like, trading on it in the future, then chances are, I mean, it can be a good project. So you can go to like, let's say, let's look into like, perps market and you can trade these things. So, you know, if you are trading on like, centralized exchanges or like, decentralized exchange options, I do think it makes sense for people to pursue these types of opportunities because, I mean, if you're trading anyways, they might as well be compensated. And, you know, hyper liquid is also doing this. So you go here, vertex is up here, hyper liquid is also down here, hyper liquid, they have this point system. I have zero points and I'm in the wooded league, right.
00:20:56.824 - 00:21:29.816, Speaker A: This makes me feel really bad, even though I literally don't care, you know, like wood, right? Like who wants to be in the wood category? So I guess good branding from their part. I used to farm this thing. So if you go here, there's this hyper liquidity, hyper liquidity provider vault, I suppose, where, you know, you can deposit stable coins. There's $12 million in here and you can receive some APR. So it's kind of similar to GLP mux LP, where you become the house. But you do take on the risk of the platform. I used to be in here, I'm no longer in there.
00:21:29.816 - 00:22:05.930, Speaker A: But maybe, you know, it might be worthwhile if you think that these cryptex tokens can do so. Yeah, it can do well, I mean, for this thing to have half a billion dollar in FDB is pretty ridiculous to me. But hey, you know, like, metrics look good. People farm, and if you look at other purpose Dex farms, you know, there's MuXlp, which also does have these arbitrary rebates where if you trade on the platform, you get fee rebates. So if you're like. I honestly think that if you're trading like, on leverage, I mean, I don't really condone that, right. I don't really trade on leverage on that.
00:22:05.930 - 00:22:33.248, Speaker A: But if you were, I think it makes sense. Looking to do arbitrary ecosystem Mux LP, right, more established. But they don't really have, like, free tokens to give away, but they, you know, they rebate you in ARP tokens. So even if you're breakeven, you know, you get some. Some back in fees. You know, hyper liquid gives you points, Vertex gives you tokens, and of course, GMX, they don't really give you tokens to trade, but if you want LP, you get some additional tokens. So the base APR comes from the fees, and then the bonus APR comes from Ar.
00:22:33.248 - 00:22:58.964, Speaker A: Like ARP token incentives. So there's that. And if you look at Dex volumes on arbitrum, you also see that, okay, the vertex is up here. Also Camelot and Trader Joe. And both of these daos also got tokens. I mentioned this before, but I'll also mention again because the yields are still pretty good. If you can LP for USDC ether, you know, it gives you 13% additional in ARb tokens, and you can kind of go down a list.
00:22:58.964 - 00:23:17.382, Speaker A: And these yields. So bad, right? Not so bad, Trader Joe. Also another Dex on arbitrum. You can go here. This gives you some drill tokens. I think the pools that contain arbitram tokens, like Pendle and GMX. Yeah.
00:23:17.382 - 00:23:57.340, Speaker A: So all these pools give away ARp tokens. So if you want to dabble around with concentrated liquidity, I think it's worth, like, trying to educate yourself. Like, LP farming for arbitram is kind of complex because, you know, you get rewarded more the tighter your liquidity range is, which, I mean, this is like a topic for a whole other video, but, you know, the fees are cheap. You're being paid in tokens. Like, might as well, like, try it out. So that's it for me. I mostly spent talking about blast, but I did want to, you know, just talk about it, you know, like this.
00:23:57.340 - 00:24:23.610, Speaker A: This thread. Right? Like, makes me think about, like. No, yeah, like, you know, this thread, like, makes me sound like some blast Max y. But, like, literally, I only bridge 0.18. Okay. Like, you know, it's like, you know, I'm bullish, but I'm not like that bullish, you know? But I do expect myself to eventually bridge there at some point or more funds at some point. Okay, so I think 24 minutes in, I'll wrap it up there.
00:24:23.610 - 00:24:43.580, Speaker A: Anything else? Yeah, I think I talk about everything. Yeah, blast. I think it makes sense. I'm super bullish. Real world assets. I think it's going to gain more adoption, and I think any project that adopts it makes sense. But anyways, thank you guys for watching.
00:24:43.580 - 00:25:11.310, Speaker A: If you liked it, please let me know. Check out the freemium discord link will be in the description below. And happy farming. And given that the markets seem to be pulling back a little bit, maybe for a humble farmer, it makes sense to say, you know what? I'm okay giving up some upside. Let me just sell half my bitcoin, half my ether, LP in GMX, for example. LP in Camelot, for example. USDC either.
