00:00:00.320 - 00:00:42.980, Speaker A: What is up guys? Tykey here and in this video I'll be going over how you can get paid to leverage trade using Aave on the polyonomatic network. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. None of this is financial advice, so let's get started. So first of all, what is leverage trading? Well, leverage trading is when you use borrower funds to increase your position on a risk on asset. So for example, if you want to take a two exposition on bitcoin for $1,000, you need to borrow $1,000 from the exchange or whatever application you're using to get exposure to $2,000 worth of bitcoin. And to borrow those dollars you need to pay an interest rate called the funding rate. And 90% of the time, in a bull market, the funding rate is positive, meaning that if you want to go along, you need to pay the house.
00:00:42.980 - 00:01:20.158, Speaker A: So for example, this is a screenshot of binance some time ago when bitcoin was 7.5 thousand, where the funding rate was 0.01% every 8 hours. Though it might not seem like much, this does add up over time. And the longer you hold on to a leveraged position means you have to pay the house more and more money. So you can see that when you borrow dollars to leverage trade, your profits diminish over time due to the funding rate. But what if I told you that you can get paid to leverage trade so your profits are amplified over time? And this is going back to the thumbnail of the video of getting paid to leverage trade using AavE.
00:01:20.158 - 00:02:07.044, Speaker A: So before I get into the tutorial on how to do this, let's go over why this is even possible. So if you aren't aware, Polygon is a scaling solution for Ethereum. It's a side chain, and they like launched basically like a few weeks ago and incentivize more and more people to use the platform and to get liquidity onto the platform. Polygon have launched many partnerships to do liquidity mining events. So for example, the $40 million program with Aave, meaning that if you use Aave, Polygon will pay you matic tokens to use the network, right? You're being paid to use these applications. So for example, if you go to the Aavey page, let's focus on this row, the USDC row. So if you deposit USDC into AavE, which is a borrowing and lending platform, you get paid 3% per year on your dollars, right? Not bad.
00:02:07.044 - 00:02:27.136, Speaker A: But on top of that matic will be paying you 4% with paid in matic tokens. Right. You're being paid to use the platform. Also, if you're going to borrow dollars from AavE, you need to pay a 3.8% interest rate to borrow those dollars. Right, which makes sense. But because they're paying you to this network, you'll be paid 4.8%
00:02:27.136 - 00:03:04.232, Speaker A: paid in matic tokens for borrowing dollars. So yeah, you're being, you're being paid to lend and borrow on Aave, which is quite insane. And I think everyone should take advantage of this. So now that you understand why this is happening and like, what's going on in the back end, let's take a look at how to take a two x leverage position on wrap bitcoin using AAvE and Polygon. Alright, so we're on AAvE, and as you can see, I have roughly $1,000 worth of bitcoin on here, earning 2% APY paid in bitcoin and 3.7% paid in matic. Okay, so in order to take two x leverage on this position, what you first need to do is to borrow against my collateral.
00:03:04.232 - 00:03:55.050, Speaker A: I'm just going to use USDC just to simplify the process. But, you know, you can borrow up to 737, but I'm just going to borrow a little bit less because I don't want to be liquidated while I take on this position. So let's say, yeah, I'll put take $650 out, take this APy borrow, and you can just borrow for essentially free for a very low transaction cost. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the USDC, go to quick swap and buy bitcoin with it. Right? So I first need to approve my USDc. And as you can see, like, the fees are so low and I'm going to be just doing this loop over and over again until I can get to exposure to bitcoin. So after my thing got approved, I can actually swap it now.
00:03:55.050 - 00:04:32.104, Speaker A: And so once I actually purchase bitcoin, what I can do is I can go back to the dashboard and deposit more bitcoin. Right? So right now I have $1,000 of bitcoin, um, with $650 borrowed against it, but I can deposit more bitcoin. Now. See, this is the bitcoin I just purchased. Now deposit that right now while I wait. Okay. And now, see now, now I have roughly $1,700 worth of bitcoin with $650 with a collateral.
00:04:32.104 - 00:04:57.284, Speaker A: Usually you have to pay if you want to take on this leverage, you have to pay like, 3.8% APY. But, you know, because matic is paying. Paying you to use Aave, I'm being paid to borrow. So now I'm essentially being paid to leverage because now I have more bitcoin, which is earning rewards, and my borrowed fund is also earning rewards. Okay, so let's get to, let's say, $2,100 with a leverage. So I need to take out almost dollar 400 more of USDC.
00:04:57.284 - 00:05:26.046, Speaker A: So let's just take that out. And this is really nice on polygon because the transaction fees are so low, unlike Eth. So I just got my USDC. Let's buy more bitcoin. Let's swap. Now, this is kind of a tedious process, but, you know, this is how. It's how you do it.
00:05:26.046 - 00:06:05.368, Speaker A: So now, after I deposit more bitcoin here, for the last time, let's wait for this to load. Okay, it's not loading, but let's just refresh to see if that helps. Okay, there you go. So now I'll just deposit bitcoin here. So now, before I did all this looping, I had $1,000 with a bitcoin on Aave, which was earning me interest. And after this, I'm going to have $2,000 worth of bitcoin earning me interest. Right.
00:06:05.368 - 00:06:40.954, Speaker A: And the borrowed, the dollars I'm borrowing is also earning me interest in terms of matic. So the cool thing about this is I'll talk about the loan to value and all that later, the risk of being liquidated. But, you know, all my bitcoin position is being paid in matic. Right, the interest. But I'm also being paid matic for the borrowed funds. So over time, I can claim the wrapped matic tokens here. I'm not going to do this yet, but I can claim matic and also deposit it here to increase the amount of collateral I have to lower the chance of me being liquidated.
00:06:40.954 - 00:07:10.658, Speaker A: So now this is how you take on two x leverage on bitcoin. You can only do this for, in terms of volatile assets, eth, bitcoin, Aave and matic. But, you know, you're being paid to take a two x leverage, which I think is incredible. And depending on how bullish you are in the markets, this might be something you might want to consider doing. All right, now that you know how to take a two x leverage position, let's go over the risks. And I think the biggest risk, and everyone should consider is the idea that you could be liquidated. Right? Being liquidated sucks.
00:07:10.658 - 00:07:52.726, Speaker A: So let's go over what would need to happen for you to be liquidated and how you can avoid doing that. So, essentially, on. If you go to the obvious website, they have this liquidation threshold, where if for bitcoin, specifically, if the loan to value of bitcoin reaches 75%, aave may liquidate your position, and they'll liquidate it whether you're asleep, whether you're awake, they'll just liquidate it for you. So, in the original example of what I just did, we see that the loan to value ratio is 50%, which makes sense. My loan, I took out a loan with dollars for $1,000. My collateral is worth $2,000 in bitcoin, so my loan to value is 50%. So if the LTV reaches 75%, I get liquidated.
00:07:52.726 - 00:08:37.082, Speaker A: So how much would bitcoin need to go down in price for this to happen? Well, if you do the math, for LTV to hit 75%, my collateral would need to dip to 13.33. This represents a 33.3% reduction in bitcoin's price, which, you know, we hope doesn't happen, but it's definitely possible. Right? So when you're taking on this leverage position, it's always good to look at the loan to value ratio, how much your collateral is worth, and if you don't want to be liquid, add more collateral if you need to do so. But also remember that with the liquidity mining program, you're being paid to lend and borrow. So when you lend out your bitcoin on AAVE, you earn 3.7% APR paid in matic tokens.
00:08:37.082 - 00:09:18.198, Speaker A: Also, when you borrow USDC from AAVe, you're earning 4.8% APR in matic tokens. So if you look at the top right, you see that my matic rewards are accruing value. And what I can do is maybe once a day, I can claim my matic tokens, redeposit mimatic tokens into Aave to increase the value of my collateral. Now, in the short term, this isn't going to amount to much. Maybe I'll earn a few dollars today for doing this leveraged position. However, over the course of a month, two months, three months, you know, I'm going to keep accruing Matic, and I'm going to deposit that matic into AAVE, and the matic that I deposit into AAVE is going to earn me more matic, so the value of my collateral would keep going up.
00:09:18.198 - 00:09:44.182, Speaker A: So though it does take a 33% dip in price because I'm earning more medic tokens. Maybe that's closer to 35% 40%. So it's relatively safe. Safe. I use air quotes for that. And also the other risks you have to consider is the smart contract risk because you're using DeFi applications and maybe hacks and USDC rap bitcoin going off peg. Aave is one of the DeFi blue chips.
00:09:44.182 - 00:10:11.984, Speaker A: They're the top lending and borrowing platform. They have over $16 billion locked in their platform. So I feel relatively safe using Aave. If this was like a no name application, I would not feel safe. But you know, Aave, this is not financial advice, but I feel relatively safe taking on this two x leverage position. And also know that the majority of the yield is being paid out in Matic tokens, right? So if the price of matic goes down, the APY will go down as well. But this also goes the other way around.
00:10:11.984 - 00:10:48.394, Speaker A: If the price of matic goes up, then your API will go higher because you know that's the reward you're receiving, that's the dividend payments. And lastly, I want to go over this is possible because of the liquidity mining incentives, which will not last forever. And it's fixed at $40 million. And right now there's $2.5 billion locked into Abe. But what if that value goes to 25 billion? What if more and more people find out about this opportunity and pile into Aave? Well, that means that, you know your percent share in Aave will be diluted, right? This is going to be more and more money. So your APR will also be diluted.
00:10:48.394 - 00:11:30.990, Speaker A: So understand that this opportunity only exists because of these liquidity mining incentives and because we are really, really early. Chances are, if you're watching this video, you're really early in the polygon and the adoption of it. So while these opportunities exist, I am trying to take advantage of them. You know, whether that be taking out loans to yield farm, taking out loans, putting it to curve, or taking out loans to leverage trade, these are all opportunities that you should take advantage of. And this is more reasons why I am bullish matic, because I do think more and more money will flow into Aave because these opportunities are just too good to pass up.
