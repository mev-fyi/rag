00:00:00.320 - 00:00:37.002, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Tyke here, and welcome to episode 23 of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast. Today I'm joined by Arthur Zero x of Defiance Capital to discuss the bullcase for Defi. And I know what you're thinking, why buy Defi? I've even seen it in my YouTube comment section when I made bullcase for Aave. I always get this pushback when talking positively about Defi. You know, it's like looking into a mirror and seeing a japanese man. It just happens every single time, you know? But, you know, Arthur and I, we discuss why we are past the trough of disillusionment and discuss the investment theses, or the lack thereof, of major defi coins in each sector. So that's lending spot and perpetuxes lsts and stable coins.
00:00:37.002 - 00:00:46.954, Speaker A: I really enjoyed the conversation, and I hope you do, too. Crypto market Wizards is an ad free and sponsor free show, and I hope you enjoy today. I have here with me Arthur Zero X. How are you doing today?
00:00:47.042 - 00:00:49.074, Speaker B: I'm doing good. Thanks for having me again, Tykee.
00:00:49.122 - 00:01:31.010, Speaker A: So this is the second time I'm going to have you on, and we're going to continue to, you know, boasts around Defi. And I think, you know, we can just dive straight into this topic, because I don't think you need an intro, but I think Arthur and I, we've both been blow posting Defi recently and calling for this Defi renaissance. And I have this slide deck prepared, and we can touch on a lot of the questions and topics that, you know, I collected from the audience, whatnot. But first of all, Arthur, you know, even on July 17, you've been saying that, you know, given the current or given the upcoming change in the political and regulatory level, you're expecting a particular sector to outperform in the next couple of months. And then ten days later, you said, hey, like, it's Defi.
00:01:31.050 - 00:01:31.202, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:31.226 - 00:01:48.196, Speaker A: The risk reward of Defi and the upside is pretty good. So we're allocating heavily, heavily into the sector. So can you first touch on why you're bullish so defi, and what kind of, I guess, changes do you expect come November that you think will help reprice Defi to the upside?
00:01:48.348 - 00:02:37.974, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the context behind the July 17 poll was really, there was a lot of the regulatory and political discussion going on, and Trump was leading the odds pretty significantly. And given the friendlier stance of republican administrations, not just on the executive level, but also on the legislature level, I think that DeFi was heavily restricted by the current stance of the SEC White House administration. So there's a huge chance for this to change. And that would really give a 180 degree turn to the sector's capability to grow going forward.
00:02:38.132 - 00:02:52.310, Speaker A: And I think the Trump odds have fallen from 60 to roughly 50 50. And I think it's basically coin toss right now. Do you think that kind of changes your expectations or do you still think that whoever is new in office will maybe change the SEC chair? And that's going to be a net bullish result.
00:02:52.890 - 00:03:29.406, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think in terms of the timeline and the short term thing, I think it does change the view a little bit. I think it is pretty binary 50 50 coin toss. If Trump win, I very likely you'll get a more like deregulated way of dealing with the industry. You're probably going to get a safe harbor implementation, that you get one to two years to experiment. You get a sufficient decentralization, you're not going to be deemed as a security, a lot more pro innovation kind of regulation. So, yeah, but I think in the long run, I do think DeFi is unstoppable.
00:03:29.406 - 00:04:01.994, Speaker B: I think even with the current hostile administration, we have seen DeFi grow and recover a lot of the damage posed the last two years of the bear market. In fact, I don't think you can point to any other sector with use cases that have actually recovered as well as DeFi. Look at NFT, look at web3 gaming. There's just simply no other sector that have really proven that there is a product market. Fitzhe I mean, you can put stablecoin as with. But yeah, stablecoin transfer. Yeah, that's definitely one of it.
00:04:01.994 - 00:04:32.120, Speaker B: I would argue that without DeFi, the growth of stablecoin would not have come so fast as well. In fact, I was a ground zero participant. A big part of the growth of USDC at the beginning was really due to coinbase support and the DeFi support. I mean, most of the OG DeFi applications just natively support USDC first. Like as the first people coin and die. And obviously you have the on off RAM and USDC supply just grew tremendously from there.
00:04:32.580 - 00:04:59.770, Speaker A: Yeah. And also like the tether supply is also up only. And you know, speaking on the DeFi renaissance, you're saying that, hey, you know, not all DeFi is going to pump, right? You have to be very selective with the assets you choose and whatnot. But how do you define a DeFi renaissance? Like, what is what, like, what even is a DeFi renaissance to you? Do you just think that like some of these coins are just going to hit all time highs or is it going to be, you know, maybe they pull off a few multiples? Like, what's your definition of this?
00:05:00.190 - 00:05:57.258, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's a, it's very similar to the whole Gartner hype cycle. I think you first some new technology go through the peak of inflated expectation, and then now they are, I think Defi have already finish, or almost finish going through the trove of disillusionment, and then we are now we are going through the enlightenment part. So, and that just has a really very similar meaning with renaissance. So that's obviously, I think you, you started using the term more, and I think that that's a very nice term to use. Yeah. So I think that the peak of disillusionment of Defi is almost over. And I think that during 20 212-020-2021 I mean, they were just, all of us, especially me, were just so excited about the potential of Defi, because coming from ICO bubble, we finally found one use case that is real, that we see.
00:05:57.258 - 00:06:35.784, Speaker B: Logically it makes sense, but I think the expectation was just too high. And obviously, with the bear market, everything just came crashing down. And then we have Luna and all this thing. Everything blew up. But, yeah, I mean, after two years, I think actually after four years, Defi summer started in 2020. And I think that we have spent enough time maturing. A lot of the applications have matured, and the sector as a whole has also recovered by all the metrics that we can observe, like tv out volumes, monthly active users, basically all sorts of objective metrics you can track.
00:06:35.784 - 00:06:54.630, Speaker B: DeFi is almost like 60% to 80% back to the previous highest number it has ever achieved. But the price, obviously, is trading in probably 20% of the previous valuation. I think that this big mismatch creates a huge opportunity for investors to capture outside return.
00:06:55.370 - 00:07:27.270, Speaker A: Yeah, and I completely agree. And that's why with this particular episode, we kind of wanted to mimic, I guess, the oncoming core episodes where I, I guess three years ago. Right. You know, you were on this pod discussing the Defi top 20. Some of them have kind of, you know, are now irrelevant, but, you know, most have survived. And I think we have these five general sectors we can talk about. So money markets, spot Dexs, lsts, decentralized stable coins, and then also the perp Dexs.
00:07:27.270 - 00:08:07.496, Speaker A: But I guess we can first touch on money markets because, you know, both you and I, we've been, I guess, bow posting Aave right, as an asset that's basically been down 80%. To 90%. But their growing market share, you know, it's no longer a low float coin, it's a high float medium to low to medium ftv coin. And they have been growing in market share relative to other lending markets. And right now it's currently trading at roughly a $2 billion valuation. So can you just, I guess, talk loosely or briefly around your Aave thesis and why you think that there's significant upside here?
00:08:07.648 - 00:08:48.092, Speaker B: Fundamentally, it's a big mismatch between the fundamental metrics aave has been putting up and with the valuation they have been trading at. Again, when I say fundamentals doesn't just reflect to PE multiples the numbers, but you're also actually looking at growth. And I mean, I understand that all crypto investors we are looking for growth to invest in. And then Aave has been actually showing very attractive growth profile. We are seeing like a 40% to 60% of consistent quarter on quarter growth despite there was some months and some quarter of that period. That was actually pretty challenging. I think we can all agree Q two and Q 320 23 was not exactly a bull market.
00:08:48.092 - 00:09:24.630, Speaker B: In fact, it was a very horrendous chop market. And then RNA's revenue still continue to grow. And the same for Q two as well. Q 220 24 was also a pretty difficult market condition to navigate. And then yet we see RBI revenue going to all time high, exceeding even the previous bull market peak. So to me that it's very rare that you see an asset that is actually trading at like a basically as a valuation with no growth, no future, but they are actually showing a very strong consistent growth and recovery. And it's also a sector with very strong mold and actually profitable.
00:09:24.630 - 00:10:21.504, Speaker B: In fact, when you look at DeFi sector, which sector have the strongest moat? The most defensible advantage is very likely to be borrowing a lending because there's a Lindy effect and it's like a 20 billion honey pot. The longer you stay unhacked, that means more likely you are secure. Obviously it's not 100%, but nothing is 100% when it comes to defi. So I think that that alone is enough to give the assurance, which is why when people say, oh, a lot of other protocols give high yield, but they give high yield, but not necessarily on a risk adjusted level. And obviously risk is. There's some objectivity and subjectivity there, but I think most of the veils, they would just rather minimize the hassle. Just, okay, if I have 100 million, 200 million to deposit for like two weeks, I'll just put into halfway for convenience sake, I don't think this will change anytime soon because you're only getting three 5% like you or like sometimes 10%.
00:10:21.504 - 00:10:45.578, Speaker B: You don't want to risk it like for like, you know, take another new unknown smart contract risk for like extra 5% higher APY. So I think this mode is very strong and actually it has been proven empirically that, you know, this is not going away anytime soon. In fact, mo four is one of the most legitimate competitors right now. They have a token incentive. And yet, you know, Aave is still the leader by far.
00:10:45.634 - 00:11:24.700, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I totally agree. And I think when we were chatting briefly around Aave, I've noticed, or you and I both noticed, that when it comes to spot Dexs, uniswap is usually number one. But if you look at base, aerodrome is number one. Even optimism, you know, it's velodrome. But if you look at money markets, Aave is number one in terms of money market tv across all chains. Because when you're putting your entire deposit at risk, because obviously a bank, you want to borrow against your assets, so you're risking your entire capital. You need to be able to trust that you're not going to get rugged.
00:11:24.700 - 00:11:54.824, Speaker A: And like you said, even if a new money market is offering 1020 percent more yield, it's not really worth the risk. For me, I don't even think about it honestly. And I think Mark Zeller, who is the head go governance guy at Aave, says, just use Aave, there's nothing else that you can use. And I think the market generally understands this, but whenever I talk to people around Defi, I'm always met with the same response. It's like, oh, no one wants touch defi, it doesn't pump.
00:11:54.952 - 00:12:34.688, Speaker B: I think there's certainly some truth to this, but I think this is changing because I think it's quite clear to everyone that is no new retail, at least a dumb retail coming here to buy our bag anymore. I think there was certain level of hoping this will, you know, we get new, new bull market again, you know, like a crazy 2021. All the dumb shit will go and pump like pump to the moon. I think it's very clear this is not happening. You know, bitcoin is all time high, have touched 70,000 multiple times, you know, and Solana have did like about ten x in a year. Where is the retail excitement? I mean, they, they come and then they went to do some meme coins and it's not a very broad based rally you hope for. So in this kind of environment.
00:12:34.688 - 00:13:08.714, Speaker B: I think protecting downside is more important. I mean, it's always more important than just purely capturing upside, but I think it's even more important because when you're down 30, 50%, it's a lot harder for you to recover those kind of losses anymore because you do not have that kind of upside volatility to make back your losses. It's simply not there. I mean, how many ten x Nick play have happened in, in the past one year? It's probably less than ten. Yeah, but in 2021, you have probably hundreds, so even you're down 50%. Okay. You catch the next 110 x, you recover most of the losses.
00:13:08.714 - 00:13:39.170, Speaker B: So I think in that sense, a lot of the more professional money, they would think in the same manner. And trust me, every single professional investor, liquid funds, prop firms, Wales, they have at least suffered a few 70% to 90% drawdown this cycle for some outcome they really believe in. And the thesis just turned out to be wrong or, you know. Yeah, for various reasons. And same thing happened to us. I mean, we, we hold something to a pretty deep drawdown. I mean, obviously we size it at the right percentage of our funds, so it's fine.
00:13:39.170 - 00:14:18.980, Speaker B: But, you know, we don't want that to happen that, that often, especially for a higher conviction investment. Yeah, and I think that the upside part is not necessarily as low as people think. Because when, when you look at it right, like what drive the price to go up? I mean, one thing, I mean, for more traditional financing, one is the multiple re rate. I mean, like the protocol can be having the same kind of fundamentals, but we simply give him like a 50 x two x TBR or like five x TBR multiple. Or it can be due to like a revenue growth. The thing is, I think what you get the most explosive return is when both are growing. Like the fundamentals are growing, but people are also repricing it higher.
00:14:18.980 - 00:14:43.740, Speaker B: So I think this is something that I think will happen to Hawaii. I think that, first of all, the multiple are too low. And secondly, I think the growth will continue. I mean, probably we're not as aggressive as starting from the lower base area, but I think that when you get both of these two happening is a very explosive kind of price action. Like Nvidia, the revenue is growing, but obviously the market is repricing the multiple to higher multiple as well.
00:14:44.440 - 00:15:28.916, Speaker A: Yeah, and there's also the buyback proposal, which I think we'll execute once the go market cap will hit 175. And then there's a bunch of other requirements. But that I think is the biggest hurdle. And they are growing market share because it's not enough that TVL is growing or revenues are growing, I think it's fairly reasonable to expect sometime next year aave to have 70, 80, 90% market share. I don't think that's crazy to think about. And if you account for that world and if you expect stablecoin inflows to hit, then, yeah, I mean, the revenues continue to grow, market share continue to grow, and then the market will put a premium to this particular asset for those reasons. But yeah, feel free to expand on whatever you're about to say.
00:15:29.028 - 00:16:23.976, Speaker B: I think probably the last but not least is it has one of the best managed Dao I have witnessed. And I was, and I'm still very disillusioned with most of the DAo out there. Having personally witnessed and participated in most of the Dao governance, most of them are pretty poorly managed. I know most, many daos people are not going to like what I say, but I think it's a fact and always exceptions. And because we're going to talk about it later, there are a lot of daos that they're not even profitable. When you see the expenses, I would say in a normal startup world with a more competitive governance accountability process, there will be a lot more questions asked and a lot more result that were required for this level of spending. But yeah, I mean, Aave have, I would say pretty well managed expenses and they have been able to deliver the result.
00:16:23.976 - 00:16:27.580, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's more of the exception of the more well managed Dao.
00:16:28.160 - 00:17:10.140, Speaker A: Yeah. So speaking on that, I guess poorly managed daos, we'll quickly skip the spot taxes aspect and we'll come back to it. But I think I, you know, no drama, right? No drama. But I think we're both, I guess, looking into Lido or talking about, I guess like Lido Dow and, you know, I guess the economics over there and, you know, whoops, let's go here. Lido is sitting at roughly a billion dollar valuation, which, given that it's the current, given it's currently like the number one lsd, I feel like it's, it is fairly attractive if you just look at it from that perspective. But they are losing market share. They peaked at roughly 33% market share.
00:17:10.140 - 00:17:51.332, Speaker A: Now they're sitting at 28. And I posted this question on Twitter. Got some decent engagement around Lido protocol economics where they have 10 million eth staked with them, but they're barely profitable. And if you look into, I guess, this late 2023, I guess, economic budget, expenses and whatnot. We see that. I mean, this isn't looking that hot, right? So I guess, you know, of course, maybe in the short term the expenses aren't that great, but perhaps they can get better and then Lido becomes a better asset and whatnot. But what are your thoughts on Lido? I think it's like a really controversial asset.
00:17:51.332 - 00:17:57.400, Speaker A: People have gotten burned over the years. I feel like at some point it's going to be a good buy. But what are your thoughts on it now?
00:17:58.830 - 00:18:49.130, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think my view on Lido is more mixed. I mean, I'm not sure whether you remember we did publish a thesis on lido one year ago, was pretty bullish on it. And I think that a lot of the part about the article is still true. But I think one thing that we did not foresee is the whole 33% market share becoming such a huge controversy in the Ethereum community, especially on the EF and ETH research side. So as a result, anytime Lido market share hit 33%, I think there will be some natural behind the scene market forces that push it down below 33%. So I think that's a problem, right? 33% become the highest market share lido can ever go unless there's some major development. But I don't think that's happening anytime soon.
00:18:49.130 - 00:19:02.020, Speaker B: So that set a cap on the growth. Right. And as an investor, if you know where the cap is, that naturally limit your upside. I mean, yeah, because you know that it's always going to be 33% of Ethereum staking ratio.
00:19:02.400 - 00:19:03.296, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:19:03.368 - 00:19:30.938, Speaker B: So I think this is something that we did not foresee to be so controversial. Yeah. And yeah, obviously the market should have declined slightly from 33 to 28.5. Yeah, but obviously Ethereum price has been underperforming. I mean, the fact is Lido's revenue is collected in Eve. And yeah, if Eve is not performing that well, it is affecting Lido's revenue pretty significantly. In fact, it is a beta, it's directly correlated.
00:19:30.938 - 00:20:11.574, Speaker B: So I think that is kind of the issue. I think the spending part I think is pretty nuanced. I think a lot of it is justified spending. I mean, to be fair, I don't do need to spend a lot on the security, maintenance. I didn't look into all the details, but I think there's definitely a good question to ask that does it need to go to a level of 30 million and why at 30 million, Lido still experience a decreased market share? I mean, obviously I saw Hasoop also. That's to defend the market share against all these people giving out free token. But I think there's a pretty acceptable answer.
00:20:11.574 - 00:20:53.400, Speaker B: But I obviously as investors, not the best answer you want, right? Yeah, I know, it's like okay, fine then, but it doesn't really excite me. So why should I go invest and buy, buy the token? What's driving it to change again? I mean spending so much money to defend existing market share isn't exactly sounds like a good investment. So I think that's kind of the issue. But I think at this valuation it is pretty attractive and there's a lot of ways they can monetize but I think they've just been flooded by the research and Ethereum foundation site too much and they just can't do anything. They need to be secure, they need to be decentralized. All this Epi ban and.
00:20:53.440 - 00:21:49.552, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no I think you came up with the term liquid venture investing and if we were to do that and we're buying these liquid coins, we need to be able to see growth and yeah, if I know that Lido market share can't go up, you know, or it can't go beyond 33% anywhere in the short to medium term maybe in the long term, yeah, but you know then it's not really exciting. It is true that all these LRTs have been spending billions of incentives with like their points programs and you know they keep, it's like never ending. Right. I feel like people have kind of come to the realization that, you know, all these LRT tokens might not be worth much and maybe once all these LRT governance tokens dump closer to zero then maybe Lido can regain its market share, who knows? But do you have any thoughts on, I guess all these LRT's like liquid restaking token governance tokens? There's a lot of TBL here, right?
00:21:49.736 - 00:22:28.578, Speaker B: I think that it's too early to say obviously. I think at this valuation they are pricing in. I mean, I mean the governance token of all this LRT are, they are obviously pricing in a lot of very aggressive growth assumption which I think that. Yeah, which make their upside a little bit limited once the unlock starts. But if some of them are going to be aggressively expanding to other chain, I mean there's a different growth story to sell. The thing is Linux is just going to focus on ETH, right? I mean they're not even expanding any other chain. In fact they gave up their Solana equity staking which they will actually have some sort of leading position there, but was not profitable to run.
00:22:28.578 - 00:22:54.684, Speaker B: But I think in hindsight you can say that it was a short sided move by the Dow as a whole to give up on Solana. Yeah. So I think, yeah, I don't see too much upside for all the governance token from a medium long term perspective. Short term, they can pump and whatever, but who knows? All different LST, they have different growth profile. And I know ether five is trying to do the mainstream adoption thing. I haven't been following up that closely.
00:22:54.732 - 00:22:58.540, Speaker A: The credit cards, they're creating credit cards, yeah, exactly.
00:22:58.580 - 00:23:13.800, Speaker B: So I think that I need to pay more attention to them. But I think that if you have some very unique kind of strategy to grow your product and market share, I mean, that might be different, but I haven't been paying close enough attention to comment too much on individual project basis.
00:23:14.300 - 00:23:32.516, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on Eigen layer? Supposedly the transferability of the governance token is going to happen late September. It seems like most people are kind of. The expectations have deflated, to say the least. Do you think it's going to be a decent project or like, what are your general thoughts?
00:23:32.708 - 00:24:23.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I'm going to ruffle a lot of feather here. I do not get the hype at the beginning and I got it afterwards, but I still think the hype was a bit too much. And I think it's mainly because there was just a severe lack of narrative for Yves. The eager layer become the next best thing for Yves. After the merge. There's basically beside Dankun, which it was a pretty significant upgrade, but I would say nothing other thing that was groundbreaking to look forward to for Ethereum beside Eagle layer and also just to let a lot of eve will to get additional yield. Because beside Egan a year, there was no other place that you can provide industrial scale level of yield for all the big ETH holders.
00:24:23.060 - 00:25:22.774, Speaker B: And obviously ETH has been underperforming. So I think that there was a huge amount of incentive for all the eve whale to make sure Egan layers stay at it, become valuable. And I think I understand the whole crypto economic primitive, but I think that it's very clear that it remains to be seen. Is, will there be enough demand for the restaking? There's a lot of supply for sure, but the demand has not shown to be very significant yet. That might change in the future, but at least for now, I think that it's not that obvious. Where is the demand coming from to sustain the yield that are required to support this level of TBL? I mean, even if you assume like five to 7% yield and Eagle layer have ten or 15 billion tvl around there. And so that's how much revenue you need to provide to all the restaker to sustain this kind of TVL.
00:25:22.774 - 00:25:23.930, Speaker B: And it's not easy.
00:25:24.670 - 00:25:39.730, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's like the seven day unstake or unrestaking period. And, yeah, if there's 15 billion in TVL, to generate 10% on that, you have to create $1.5 billion worth of value. Where's that coming from? I have no idea. No one has yet. I guess, given me like an example.
00:25:41.150 - 00:25:41.930, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:42.390 - 00:25:43.930, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:25:44.510 - 00:25:56.574, Speaker B: It's definitely like one of the top project, you know, brings out a lot of interesting question and obviously further solidify eve status as a pristine asset, if eager layer really becomes successful.
00:25:56.622 - 00:26:40.466, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But I think we can kind of move on to spot Dexs. I guess the summary here is that for money markets, you know, obvious, attractive LST, LRT's, you know, maybe good to farm, but tokens themselves may be not so attractive. But I want to get your takes on spot Dexs because I've been looking into, you know, like, I guess, uniswap more closely recently. Because I know Uniswap before it's going to launch sometime in September or October, sometime later this year. I think it's in audits right now. And if you look at the current market share of all these spot Texas, we have Uniswap at 44% Pancakeswap 22, followed by aerodrome at eight, dodo 6.4.
00:26:40.466 - 00:27:01.940, Speaker A: And then curve, I don't know, like roughly 5%. And we've seen the Dex to sex spot trade volume. So more and more activity is happening on chain. Maybe that's due to, like, meme coins and whatnot. And. But I guess, before I talk about all these, what do you think about Uniswap? It's a category leader. They've maintained market share.
00:27:01.940 - 00:27:13.340, Speaker A: I guess from your Avi thesis, I feel like Uniswap can be a close contender for something that could be, I guess, investable. But do you have any thoughts on this?
00:27:14.360 - 00:27:51.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that Uniswap is, despite no fee switch and charging a front entry to accrue to the company is still the most valuable defi protocol out there. Say something. Right. The market clearly thinks that it is worth a lot and its dominant position is likely to stay. I tend to agree. In fact, Uniswap is dominant in almost every single chain it is deployed to, except for base. And that only happened recently when aerodrome launched slipstream.
00:27:51.024 - 00:28:24.938, Speaker B: Before that, even then, Uniswap was dominating the volume even at base as well. So I think that is definitely one of the blue ship defi protocol there. Yeah. But I think that the issue is the whole fee switch thing is like there was just too much back and forth. Seems like the Uniswap foundation proposed that and then it got killed. So, yeah, I think that this count is sent a very mixed signal. Again, I'm not very close to the team.
00:28:24.938 - 00:28:48.696, Speaker B: I don't spend that much time, governance forum, et cetera, mostly reading up from the news. But I'm not really sure, like, you know, what is the direction here. And obviously I understand the fact that they are facing pressure from sec. They receive, well, notices, makes it difficult. Right. But again, as an investor, I think that car uncertainty, um, just means that I don't have to pull the trigger at the moment. Yeah.
00:28:48.696 - 00:29:02.740, Speaker B: And again, v four is launching and obviously, you know, we want to see the traction and the success of uniswap v four. Um, yeah. And it's getting so close anyway, so you can't wait and observe before you make any decision. And then that's my view.
00:29:03.360 - 00:29:36.044, Speaker A: Okay. So I guess more of a wait and see approach. Um, and maybe there's some binary outcome there, wherever. Maybe if the Republicans win the election, maybe the regulatory concerns go away and then swap can potentially turn on the P switch. Because this was back in February of this year, this guy put out this proposal to turn on or potentially uni staking and putting on the fee switch. The problem is that it always gets voted no against by Andreessen Horowitz. I feel like this is one of the problems with Dao governance.
00:29:36.044 - 00:30:13.152, Speaker A: It's, you know, Andreessen and maybe like some Michigan blockchain club, right? They're like, just like they're the ones that kind of determine like what happens to these Daos and whatnot. But like talking about the fees, obviously they don't make any fees from the LP's, but they turned on, you know, a 15 basis point fee in the front end October of last year, and then April of this year they hiked it from 15 basis points, 25 basis points. And if you look at the front end fee, like revenue, I mean, it's looking pretty good. I mean, you know, this, they're making a lot of money. It's a lot of, I guess, good flow, right. Uninformed retail flow. That's just go to unisoft.org
00:30:13.152 - 00:30:27.300, Speaker A: to like swap and doesn't use an aggregator. But I guess the problem is, like you said, the value accrues to the equity not the token. Do you think that's going to change anytime soon? Do you think, you know, this type of fee switch will ever be?
00:30:27.680 - 00:31:14.434, Speaker B: I guess, yeah, I think, yes, I think, I'm very sure, given long enough timeline, that will change. But are we talking about six months or are we talking about two years? Because I think when it comes to fee switch of Uniswap, I think you see two different arguments. One is like, Uniswap is still a lot of room for growth ahead. It should not sacrifice the future growth just to capture another 1015 basis point of fees to the protocol. So it should, in fact, further strengthens and deepens its dominance first, before even turning on the feed switch, because they are worried that if you turn on the feed switch, you know, other protocol will fork it and out compete uniswap. And then there's no point turning on a feed switch if. If uniswap is going to lose its dominance.
00:31:14.434 - 00:31:40.810, Speaker B: And you can't see that playing out in base, right. I mean, aerodrome kind of outcompeted uniswap a little bit. Um, obviously, aerodrome is paying out a lot in incentive to achieve that. So, um, you know, if Viva incentive is hard to say, you know, will aerodrome have the same level of dominant competitiveness? So I don't. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer. You know, the. You know, both sides can be valid.
00:31:40.810 - 00:32:01.252, Speaker B: Yeah. But I do think that, you know, this discussion should not be some thing you push forward forever. It has to be a more like a concrete timeline that. Yeah, I mean, we can't say that just because we want to focus on growth. You know, we want to keep pushing it back. And when it's, you know, so you need to set a metric right. So what level of metrics that we deem that.
00:32:01.252 - 00:32:07.520, Speaker B: Okay. Is the right time for the protocol to turn on the fee switch to capture some value. Yeah.
00:32:07.940 - 00:32:23.580, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, from my perspective, I feel like uniswap is going to be an asset that's going to pump at some point. It's just that I don't know when it's going to pump. You know, it could be, like you said, six months or two years or even six years for all we know. Right. And that kind of what makes it hard.
00:32:24.480 - 00:32:51.050, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that the upside is there. I mean, because when you look at how profitable centralized exchange is, like, uniswap have a lot of upside left. If, you know, if, let's say we see the Dex to centralized exchange ratio going up to what, like 40 50% in the next three to five years. So the upside is definitely there. So I think the value capture has to come. But with all this uncertainty, it's just hard for investor to make a decision right now.
00:32:51.050 - 00:32:57.290, Speaker B: Unless you're willing to underwrite like a 510 year bet. I mean, that's a different story. That's what the vc has been doing.
00:32:57.630 - 00:33:14.860, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, I guess. Now the next question is on, I guess, these other dexes. There's balancer curve, pancakeswap, by the way, pancakes. I mean, good for them. I mean, they have 23% of Dex volume. I didn't even know that. They're kind of slowly chugging away, I guess.
00:33:14.860 - 00:33:34.600, Speaker A: But you know, the. I guess they do half the volume of Uniswap for that, roughly 10th of the valuation. Of course, you know, you have to put a multiple on and it's like, you know, it's pancakeswap. Right. But do you have any thoughts on these other dexes? Do you think they're, there's a chance they recover or do you mostly think that, you know, it's going to be Uniswap, just keep eating market share?
00:33:38.350 - 00:34:07.088, Speaker B: I think it would be tough. The honest answer is I think that all of them have some pretty glaring issue from investor point of view. So it will be tough for them to present a very solid investment opportunity. Yeah, I mean, if you want to go on every single one of them.
00:34:07.144 - 00:34:43.999, Speaker A: But, yeah, we don't have to go over. I guess I was just curious, your takes on, I guess, the other Dex is. My personal bias has been that I think a lot of the DeFi primitives have already been made, and I think it's pretty clear who the winners are in each category. So I think if I were to buy anything, it's going to be the category leaders. And I'm not really too interested in number two, number three, number four, number five, because they can, they can switch slots, but they're never going to overtake uniswap. So, like, why would I. Sure, maybe there's a relative value play in there somewhere, but it's not really that interesting, I guess.
00:34:44.699 - 00:35:10.260, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I think curve had a chance to carve out a very interesting niche, which is like the stable coin swap or like a stable value asset pair kind of swap. But I think due to the various. A lot of issue, I shall not repeat, I think that just make it a lot harder for professional investor to underwrite this.
00:35:12.600 - 00:35:35.810, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And I think you wanted to touch briefly on Solana Defi, but I think we can do that later because I know Solana spot Dex volumes are also doing pretty well. Um, we can talk about Solana Defi briefly at the, at the audience question part. Um, but I do want to just briefly touch on number four. Uh, I guess the decentralized stablecoin sector. Um, of course not. Maker, right.
00:35:35.810 - 00:36:03.324, Speaker A: Has roughly 5 billion. Sorry, uh, Dai markets like roughly 5 billion. Maker did really well. Um, it went up almost ten x from the bottom in December. Sorry, bottom in 2023 to, I guess, you know, sometime a few months ago. And you know, they recently rebranded to sky and they kind of had like, this funny. Not, maybe not so funny, but yeah, like, it looks like ruin is being held hostage here, but maker is going to rebrand to Sky.
00:36:03.324 - 00:36:17.490, Speaker A: Sky protocol, and then Dai is going to rebrand to usds, which I thought was interesting. First of all, do you have any thoughts on this rebrand? It kind of feels weird right now, but who knows? Maybe it'll work.
00:36:18.430 - 00:36:50.150, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think this has been communicated way in advance. Obviously, they are only revealing the name, the actual name of the rebrand, which is called sky. So I think for those who have been paying attention to the maker governance, it's not surprising at all. And the rebranding of Dai to a new stable coin, which I think that you have to, for brand purposes, you have to call USD something. It's just a lot. Easily recognizable and understandable, is packed to us dollar, which is one to one.
00:36:50.150 - 00:37:07.562, Speaker B: So I think USD is fine. It's okay, Sky. I think it's fine as well. I mean, I don't have a very strong view on this. I guess it's just like the whole execution wasn't done that smoothly. I mean, the maker down handle was taken away by some random guys.
00:37:07.666 - 00:37:08.402, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:08.586 - 00:37:42.660, Speaker B: So, I mean, it's a small thing. I think that, you know, after a while people forget about this. So, yeah, I think that fundamentally this is something that is interesting. I think if executed well, this is like a new catalyst to spur the next stage of growth for makerdao, but, yeah, but it's a catalyst, right? I mean, the execution has to be done well. Yeah, hopefully we can see dye supply continue to grow after the rebrand. Yeah, yeah. And I do think that the rebrand will make it more, um, acceptable from a mainstream audience point of view.
00:37:43.280 - 00:38:17.880, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree. I mean, I've been covering maker heavily since last year, but, you know, I kind of moved on, unfortunately, because I knew Endgame was a catalyst, but I felt like it was getting slightly bit too crowded. And unfortunately, you know, as you can see here, the DAi supply has not been growing, unfortunately. I think we can kind of briefly talk about, I guess, the whole decentralized stable sector as a whole, because at the end of the day, they're all basically wrapped USDC. Right. Do you think there is hope for decentralized stable coins or do you just think that there's USDC wrappers that have some cap upside?
00:38:19.380 - 00:39:06.436, Speaker B: I think there's always a hope. And I think that it's still the holy grail that the crypto space hope to eventually have won a major one. I think that it's just that we have to be realistic about the market size of it. And I think that a decentralized stablecoin doesn't have to be as big as tether to be considered successful, as long as it's achieved sufficient liquidity for most of us to be able to transact with it, store our value with it, and it doesn't rock. So I would consider that a success. It doesn't have to be have the same level of reach as tether or USDC. So I think in a way Dai have achieved some level of success there.
00:39:06.436 - 00:39:26.084, Speaker B: Really. And I think that it's good that they are splitting into two. Right. But I'm not sure why that the pure decentralized version of DAi is only launching so much later. I think ideally they are launching at the same time, so people can choose like the purists can choose. Okay, I don't want to touch any of the RWS stuff. I want completely decentralized, censorship resistant Dai.
00:39:26.084 - 00:39:44.440, Speaker B: They can switch to the new decentralized Dai while people who want the more liquidity, you know, like more mainstream stuff, can swap the usds. Yeah, but I think that the decentralized DAi is launching way later. I'm not sure when is it launching. So if you want to swap now, you can't only can upgrade to the USDS.
00:39:45.780 - 00:40:02.230, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree. It feels like, you know, all these decentralized stable coins, it kind of has to be backed by some form of stable collateral and that kind of limits the potential upside, or at least like the narrative and whatnot.
00:40:03.410 - 00:40:50.250, Speaker B: No, I actually think. No, I actually don't think so. Still quite purist. I think that if we have a very censorship resistant way to bring bitcoin into other smart contract layer one, we can use bitcoin as a collateral to the most simple form maker dealt with bitcoin Eve as a collateral. I'm pretty sure we can get to 20 billion of decentralized stablecoin supply and I would say that is considered a big success for me. But obviously there's a challenge. It's hard to bring bitcoin to other smart contract layer one in censorship, resistance and decentralized, trusted, trustless manner.
00:40:50.250 - 00:40:52.426, Speaker B: I think that's technical challenge part.
00:40:52.618 - 00:41:13.930, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess your view is that we don't have to overtake tether, we can just create something with 10 billion mark cap with sufficient enough liquidity and that would still be a huge success. We haven't seen that yet. I guess Lusd tried that with eth collateral. You know, they all, I guess, experience like some issues at some point once there's some form of liquidity.
00:41:14.310 - 00:41:15.130, Speaker B: Yep.
00:41:15.470 - 00:41:48.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess, like, you know, one of the bear cases for maker is, you know, we're potentially entering like a rate cutting cycle. So in like the RW T bill, revenue kind of goes down. But I guess, broadly talking about like Defi as a whole, like, what do you think? You know, rates going from like, let's say five to, to, let's say three ish, three and a half, like mid to late next year. Do you think that's going to bring more stablecoin inflows to DeFi and that could be also a catalyst, or do you think that rates have to go to zero in order for anyone to like a bunch of dollars?
00:41:49.000 - 00:42:47.392, Speaker B: No, I think there's 100% going to be positive for DeFi. Because the fact is, a lot of the new market participants into DeFi in 2021, they all came in to search for you, right? And obviously, many got burned for various reasons. And then you had traditional finance paying you five and a half, 5.3% risk free, and just that suddenly make the whole Defi yield attractiveness significantly lesser. So I don't think we're going to see like a max flowback immediately. But as we see like a 100 basis point card or 200 basis point card over one year to two years, I think that will be significant enough to move the dollars on the margin to come back to DeFi again to experiment with it, to try some of the yield. I think that, look at it, Defi have recovered, I would say, by most metrics, like anywhere between 50% to 70% of the previous all time high metric in a 5.5%
00:42:47.392 - 00:43:06.210, Speaker B: interest rate environment, and after going through a 2022 bear market. So imagine what you can do with probably 3% interest rate, a more friendly regulatory environment, and probably a bull market. So, yeah, I think that people are just not pricing all this possibility.
00:43:07.310 - 00:43:36.116, Speaker A: Yeah, and this is a tailwind, right? This is a fundamental tailwind that's going to bring more dollars on chain. And we talk about, I guess, at DeFi Renaissance, and we are in the trough of disillusionment and we're trying to get out of there. And, yeah, I agree. I think we're both bullish DeFi. But lastly, the sector I want to talk about is perp dexs. This is interesting sector. This is from Artemis, the data dashboard company and whatnot.
00:43:36.116 - 00:44:15.582, Speaker A: But right now, hyper liquid has just taken complete control over, I guess, the perpetex narrative. And DyDX still doing decent volume. But I guess one problem that I've noticed in the sector is that I feel like there can be a new perpetex every year that will introduce some, like, points program, and then they're going to be number one. Of course, the hyper liquid bulls are going to say that, you know, hyper liquid is like, you know, there is no second best, right? It's like community owned and whatnot. But, you know, what do you think about the perpetex sector? Because, like, this sector makes a lot of money. It's just that the tokens have, like, not done so hot. Have you looked into this sector at all? Do you have any thoughts?
00:44:15.606 - 00:44:51.654, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a sector that we pay a lot of attention to. And obviously from my past investment experience with Dividx as well. Yeah. So, yeah, it has probably the highest upside from a sector point of view, because derivative trading is the largest revenue source for all the centralized exchange. And there's no reason why fundamentally pump taxes can't capture more of these market share. And obviously, hyper liquid is taking all the attention right now. And I think rightfully so.
00:44:51.654 - 00:45:38.756, Speaker B: They have built what traders want, very responsive to market demands and very good UI UX and everything just really respond. They listen to the consumer, to the customers very well, and respond very quickly, like what you say. I think until right now, it doesn't seem like the dominance can be very entrenched. So it's hard to say whether the winner now will stay the winner next year. And again, because a lot of them are giving us so much token as incentive to incentivize the volumes and trading, most of them came with a pretty high inflation. And it just happened in altcoin kind of bear market. And all this kind of selling pressure is very hard to absorb.
00:45:38.756 - 00:46:16.604, Speaker B: And it's just a confluence of factors just make people staying away. And I think this is even true for professional investors who believe in a sector that all of us are just becoming a lot more careful when we coming to investing in any new product out there. And I think GMX was like a darling in 2022 to early 2023. Then you have some, I think, by the ex came back a bit because we are launching v four revenue sharing. And then early this year, hyper liquid overtake divided x, and then. Yeah, now it's still hyper liquid and adding you have vortex, like, came in a little bit and then now fall off the radar again.
00:46:16.732 - 00:46:45.366, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I guess it kind of goes back to the moat aspect where when it comes to money markets, right. If you're risking your entire deposit, you want to be able to trust. So there's a moat there, or there's like the lendingist mote. There may be the same for uniswap as well, and maybe also lido. But for perp dexes, it's so easy to just go from hyper liquid to GMX or like from one perp Dex to another, as long as you're being paid for. Right.
00:46:45.366 - 00:46:58.958, Speaker A: It seems like the risk profile for trading on, you know, these perp dexs, it doesn't really change from one venue to the next. Maybe if you take into account the liquidity and whatnot. So, yeah, it's from like an investment perspective. Yeah, go for it.
00:46:58.974 - 00:47:42.300, Speaker B: Actually, it does. If you're trading size, you do care about the integrity of the exchange. How does the exchange handle the liquidation? During a market stress event, you don't want to be wrongfully liquidated, close out your position at the bottom, and then market bounce back. Happened a lot of time. Five, six years ago, Derek Bitwax, all this thing always happened and people always complain, and we just don't see those issue as much on centralized exchange anymore because they've come, fixed it and. Yeah, so, but I actually, all these things matter for pub decks as well. It's just I think that we, we haven't get to that level of scale where, you know, you see that many people trading 1020 million of size, you know, this.
00:47:42.300 - 00:48:32.918, Speaker B: Most of the trader, I know that trading above 10 million, like prop directional trader, they are still trading on central exchange. Yeah, yeah. And I think one big tailwind, I think would happen for Pubdex, which I think is, still will happen in the future, but I don't know how far it will come. I actually thought that after binance settled with DOJ, a lot of the other exchanges, they will fall in line, they will restrict the country they can offer per Dexas to, so, thus making this business increasingly harder to run. In fact, the largest revenue source is slightly us, followed by probably Asia, like Chinese that doesn't live in China or using VPN. Korea. Korea user and the rest of Asia and probably some in Europe.
00:48:32.974 - 00:48:33.570, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:34.830 - 00:49:04.580, Speaker B: But so far, it seems like the regulatory arbitrage strategy for all these offshore exchange central exchanges are still sustainable. I mean, you look at what bybit, Bitgare, they're all still very profitable. They make more money than all the top DeFi protocol combined. Yeah, still. Yeah, not even the top one. Let's talk about not even, like Binance. Talk about after that bybit OKX, Bitget, they're all making so much money.
00:49:04.580 - 00:49:23.470, Speaker B: Yeah. So I thought that will come very quickly after Binance have this issue with DOJ, whatever. But surprisingly, it's taking a while to materialize. So that is one big tailwind that I think will eventually happen, but seems to be taking longer than expected to play out.
00:49:23.770 - 00:49:44.730, Speaker A: Yeah. All the big size traders I know, they're all on centralized exchanges. And I guess until perp Dexs offer, like, a ten x better experience, it's hard to, I guess, get people to leave. But I do think it'll happen. It's just that I guess the timing is uncertain, which I guess seems to be common idea of this episode.
00:49:45.230 - 00:50:13.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I think also one thing, right, there's a big convenience for central exchange that you can trade spot and perp at the same time, and it's kind of hard for pubdex to offer that right now. Yeah, it might change in the future. Like, yeah, we need a breakthrough in the cross chain bridging technology. That doesn't rub, but I mean, the best bridge are central exchange right now. I mean, everyone use binance as a bridge if it has a binance account.
00:50:14.180 - 00:50:19.332, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I use coinbase too, for bridging and whatnot.
00:50:19.516 - 00:50:25.480, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So it's kind of hard to replace this convenience and function.
00:50:25.900 - 00:51:20.792, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So I think that's enough on perp Texas, but I do want to talk about some audience questions, and I think, you know, versus here, I guess, asked you to expand on the recent Vitalik comments around Defi and just to give some background for the audience in the study labs is another podcast I do. We had Kane from Synthetix on or Infinix, and he kind of talked about how Vitalik doesn't care too much about Defi, and there's a lot of discussions on Twitter, and Vitalik responded to one of these threads where he said that Defi seems like it's currently mostly a downstream of the existence of the eTH market, which means that while Defi may be great. It's fundamentally capped and can't be the thing that brings crypto to another ten to 100 x adoption burst. And to that you said, hey, this is not bullish. I'm bullish.
00:51:20.792 - 00:51:28.944, Speaker A: Solana Defi. So I guess, first, can you talk about your thoughts on the Vitalik tweet, and then we can talk about Solana Defi and what you're looking at there.
00:51:29.112 - 00:52:38.680, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think perhaps I didn't really expand on it, and I think that what he said is largely correct, but this is on the context that people are complaining that Vitalik doesn't care about DeFi, while DeFi is the thing that make Eve valuable and arguably sustain the current valuation. And he just ignored that part and just went on and said, oh, but it's not going to be the thing that bring the next ten to 100 x adoption to crypto. And where is the yield coming from? It's just a downstream of which I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of economics. As long as both parties are doing a willing exchange of product or services, and both party come out thinking that they get a better exchange from it, this is a positive value exchange. This is like a kind of like a, I think, fundamental principle of economics. It doesn't matter because everyone values things in a subjective manner, and this is how utility is being created. So.
00:52:38.680 - 00:53:22.710, Speaker B: And there's many reasons people want to borrow some for speculation, some they want to capture the upside in the future. They don't want to. So that's not the right question to ask. And I think that it's fair to levy this criticism to order, you know, unsustainable Ponzi, you know, like, I don't say that pure Ponzi, like, ohm all this thing, but most of the DeFi right now are not those. Right? I mean, so I think it's just unfairly categorized DeFi to the worst part, like the most unsustainable part of Defi. While Defi is doing a ton of heavy lifting to make ETH worth the current valuation and market cap. And, yeah, continue to stay on as the number two crypto asset, so.
00:53:22.710 - 00:53:57.822, Speaker B: And also, like, if you're defi builders, it's just not exciting to see. Right. Yeah, you're already dealing with so much L2 liquidity, fragmentation. And I think that this is something that's still debatable, but solidity are just turing complete, but it's a lot harder to make it secure. I mean, we have, obviously, another biggest complaint of DeFi over the past two years, which I think is very legitimate and also one of the reasons why Defi momentum can't stop is just too many hacks. Right. You see big exploit, you see big hacks every month, I think kind of slowing down recently.
00:53:57.822 - 00:54:00.210, Speaker B: Okay, I hope I don't jinx it. Please cut this away.
00:54:01.110 - 00:54:04.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I hope not either. I don't want to get rugged.
00:54:04.670 - 00:54:27.106, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But I mean it's just that scare people away, right? I mean, and I think the fact is other programming language, I think you probably easier to do formal verification, it's easier to clearly define the objective and etcetera, just make it a lot harder, I would say harder, like likely to be more secure than solidly as a programming language.
00:54:27.298 - 00:54:38.270, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I guess expanding on that, like do you have thoughts on Solana Defi? Have you, like is there anything that excites you over there? And if so, like what kind of sectors and I guess projects are you looking at?
00:54:39.410 - 00:55:38.904, Speaker B: So I think the most impressive thing on Solana Defi is Jupiter. Right? So in fact it's kind of like a antithesis of what is happening on ethereum defi. Because one thing that surprised me about Ethereum Defi a few years ago is the aggregation theory did not play out. So what is aggregation theory? It was coined by Ben Thompson, tech strategist that wrote a lot of his view on the tech sector, saying that the aggregator are the ones that end up capturing value, like Google's Amazon, because they aggregate the news, they own the distribution channel to the user, so they will capture the most value. But in Ethereum defi, it didn't play out. Right. None of the Dex aggregator managed to out compete at Uniswap, although fundamentally, logically, you should always go to the Dex aggregator because you always get a better price, if not the same price compared to Uniswap.
00:55:38.904 - 00:56:15.402, Speaker B: But that doesn't happen. I mean, I mean, obviously we can argue why it doesn't happen, but from a pure theory point of view, it should happen. Right? And there's quite a lot of team building Dex aggregated as well. But when you flip it to Solana, it did happen. The most valuable DeFi protocol is a DAX aggregator, which is Jupiter. It's worth like what, 8 billion on a fully diluted basis. In fact, the only two Solana project that are worth more than a billion dollar FTV are Jupiter and Jiro.
00:56:15.402 - 00:56:49.294, Speaker B: None other Solana protocol, whether it's DeFi or any other thing like NFT marketplace or RWA, are worth more than 1 billion, if I remember correctly. If you remember any, you can point out to me, I don't think there's any. And then you have Jupiter so far ahead at 8 billion valuation. So what makes them. In fact Jupyter have almost the same valuation as UnisOC. Right. Obviously the circulating market cap is quite big difference and Jupiter just voted to destroy 30% of the fully diluted supply from the team, from the community, whatever.
00:56:49.294 - 00:57:20.200, Speaker B: So I think that's very interesting to observe that the aggregation theory playing out in Solana defi but not playing out in the ethereum. And obviously you can attribute this to the team and etcetera. But I think this is something that's very interesting to observe. And I have my own theory on why Jupyter are able to command this valuation. I think a big part of it is due to founder premium and obviously they can't own the user distribution channel. How UNiSOC can't also own the user distribution channel as well.
00:57:20.500 - 00:58:04.470, Speaker A: Yeah, and they also have a perps product which is doing really well. Maybe that whole, the tidbit you talked about, aggregation theory, maybe on ETH there's all these l two s and fragmented liquidity. So aggregators don't accrue value, but on a monolithic chain maybe it makes more sense for a central, I guess, aggregator to accrue all the value. And Jupiter has amazing products. I mean, JLP I think is one of my favorite products in Solana. It's like, it's literally up only, you know, like I made a video on my channel like early this year saying hey, like I'm going to take profits into Jupiter. But as a mid curve myself, I thought that ETH was going to pump in post ETF.
00:58:04.470 - 00:58:27.200, Speaker A: And I was like, mentally I was like, I'll hold eth, I'll sell into the pump and I'll rotate to Jupiter or JLP. But I didn't even follow my own advice. But I love GLP. I think it's like one of the best products in crypto. And yeah, I mean it's crazy how Jupiter is doing so much volume despite it essentially being like a somewhat of a fork of the GMX model.
00:58:28.380 - 00:59:01.580, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. I think Jupiter is interesting because it's worth significantly more than all the other Solana defi protocol. And I think Jitto is interesting as well because essentially it's kind of like a combination of lido plus flashbot plus Eigen layer on Solana. So you can't get three kind of big vertical into one single project as a leader. Yeah, I think that makes it interesting.
00:59:02.320 - 00:59:20.180, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the bulk case for Jupyter as well is that it kind of becomes like a BNB type asset where you can stake it for airdrops. Right. BNB is, you know, launch pad and. Yeah. And Jupiter is also kind of similar. Of course, we have to wait longer to see how that plays out.
00:59:20.800 - 00:59:21.312, Speaker B: Yep.
00:59:21.376 - 00:59:29.500, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, Jupiter being worth. I mean, I never expected Jupiter to be worth this much. It's pretty astounding.
00:59:30.000 - 00:59:58.090, Speaker B: And I think it's also just demonstrate the power of, you know, really trying as much as possible to embrace a community owned I ethos. I think there was just too much vc ownership down only chart. Yeah. And then Jupyter went to launch a pretty. No VC allocation, fully community owned, and it just really resonated with the community. Right.
00:59:58.870 - 01:00:15.092, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, well, I think that's all the topics that I prepared today. We've been going at it for an hour. Thank you so much for your time. Arthur, is there any, I guess, things you. That I've left out that you want to talk about or. Yeah, just anything?
01:00:15.156 - 01:00:23.920, Speaker B: No, I think we cover a lot. Yeah. And I probably missed out some contents here and there, but, you know. Yeah, it's okay.
01:00:24.500 - 01:00:30.960, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think this was a really insightful episode for me and hopefully for my audience as well.
01:00:32.020 - 01:00:32.332, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:32.356 - 01:00:44.708, Speaker A: Like both Arthur and I, we are big believers in Defi. We do believe in the Defi renaissance, but we do also believe that you have to be selective in terms of assets. You can't just buy Defi things because they're defi.
01:00:44.764 - 01:00:44.956, Speaker B: Right.
01:00:44.988 - 01:01:01.840, Speaker A: That's like saying that I'm going to buy Polkadot because Solana went up. Right. Because it's an alto one. It doesn't work that way. You have to buy things that asset selection is key. You have to buy things that I think are growing, are. Have defensible modes that have some reasonable pathway towards value capture.
01:01:01.840 - 01:01:12.600, Speaker A: Yep. I guess. Like, what are the types of, I guess, key metrics that you look at in order for you to, you know, I guess, justify buying a particular asset?
01:01:13.900 - 01:01:24.748, Speaker B: I think. I think it's a combination of all the factors that you mentioned just now. And obviously, we will play place a different weightage to those factors depending on the circumstances.
01:01:24.924 - 01:01:35.680, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. And last question for you, or one or two more questions, I guess, other than Defi, what other sectors excite you in crypto?
01:01:39.180 - 01:02:22.500, Speaker B: I think at the moment, no other sectors have bigger impact than Defi. I was pretty excited about web3 gaming. I'm still excited, but I think the impact gonna take a longer. Gonna take more time to play out. And yeah, I think in the short term I don't see any big change coming, but I think there's some solid web3 gaming team has been building very solid progress. But I think it would probably take the next phase of mass consumer adoption for this to really play out. So I think, I think we are just being patient with it.
01:02:22.500 - 01:02:58.060, Speaker B: And I think the whole outlier one thesis is more exciting again, because I think that we see that the smart contract layer one leadership is not insurmountable. In fact, Ethereum is giving away this lead. So the race is on again, right? I mean, if Solana can do it in two years, what's preventing from other smart contract layer one from trying? I mean, I think most of them are not going to work, but you know, who knows, right? I mean there might be one that get to like 50% of Solana market share.
01:02:58.840 - 01:03:50.710, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I didn't think about that. But yeah, I guess Ethereum's diminishing market share or even mind share can just drive other tokens to at least try, right? I mean, all these new tokens or all these new projects, they have a lot of tokens in the treasury. They can just start pumping out incentives and maybe one will stick. And final question for you, I guess, is, I guess I want to tie in this question that I always put in around, I guess, our audience, my audience including myself, we all want to make it in the next year or two. Obviously it's better to take a longer term time horizon, but we all want to make it to some extent, I guess. Do you have any advice for people that's grinding out there? And also maybe you can tie this in if you can give advice to your younger self. Right? Maybe you were new to defi or crypto markets.
01:03:50.750 - 01:04:52.296, Speaker B: What would it be that is spread loaded question? It depends on which area you want to focus on, I would say it's definitely worth investing a lot of time to make sure you have the foundational knowledge to approach stuff and not to get confused and carried away by all the signal. I think that one thing about crypto, especially if you spend time on Twitter, is everything is optimized around attention and noise and you need to be able to surface the signal from the noise. And once you acquire this skill, it will be a lot easier to tell the bullshit. I mean, even for some big accounts, whatever, they might have their own view that might be wrong or just, or like, they have their own incentive driving that view. So learning how to filter out different information, knowledge and all these things will carry one very far in this industry. Yeah. And obviously have.
01:04:52.296 - 01:05:21.980, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, have some guiding principle of, like, how you conduct certain things, especially for this space. And I think one thing extremely underrated is just survival. I think people really, all of us, I think, vastly underestimated the importance of just survive in this industry because there's just so little parties or people that actually can survive multiple cycles in this space. For some weird reason, even some of the biggest players inevitably blew up in some manners over years.
01:05:22.960 - 01:05:25.780, Speaker A: Yeah. I guess, you know.
01:05:28.520 - 01:05:56.410, Speaker B: Back to what we discussed. I mean, when we talk about DeFi, when you look at the top 20 DeFi protocol three or four years ago, how many of them are still here, still doing well and why? I mean, I was very bullish aave four years ago. Why do I like it again? Because turn out all four years later, I mean, they're still here, still crushing it. And that's just extremely rare to find. Right. How many stuff, how many things in crypto after four or five years are still here, still crushing it? You can count it on two hands probably.
01:05:56.990 - 01:06:23.998, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I guess going back to the whole separating signal from noise, I think using Twitter and, I guess, social media as, like, a tool to help form your own decisions. But you shouldn't use this video or another Taika video or some random tweet as, like, a source of truth. Right. You should form your own conclusions, have your own worldviews, and, you know, by definition, if you're just following the crowd, you're not gonna outperform. You have to have your own ideas.
01:06:23.998 - 01:06:28.694, Speaker A: And I think that's one of the most important takeaways from this episode, I think, that you highlighted.
01:06:28.782 - 01:06:29.934, Speaker B: Yep, absolutely.
01:06:30.062 - 01:06:39.270, Speaker A: Well, anyways, thank you so much, Arthur, for your time. I hope everyone enjoyed the episode, and I hope to see you guys for episode 24. Thank you for watching, and see you guys another time. Bye bye.
