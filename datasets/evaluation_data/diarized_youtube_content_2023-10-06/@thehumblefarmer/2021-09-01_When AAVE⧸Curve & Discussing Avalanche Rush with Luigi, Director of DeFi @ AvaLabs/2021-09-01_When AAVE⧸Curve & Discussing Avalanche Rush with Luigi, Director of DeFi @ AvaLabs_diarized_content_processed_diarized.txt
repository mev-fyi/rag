00:00:00.440 - 00:00:17.050, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And today I'm very honored to have Luigi from Avalabs come onto the show. He is the director of Defi at Avalanche Labs and I'm like, looking forward to asking lots of questions about Avalanche Rush and how he thinks about the defi ecosystem. So thanks for being on the channel. And how are you doing today?
00:00:18.150 - 00:00:22.410, Speaker B: Great. Tyky, thank you for having me and looking forward to talking to you.
00:00:23.510 - 00:00:33.410, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Yeah. So just for, just for the people that aren't familiar with who you are, when did you get into crypto and what do you do for Eva Labs more specifically?
00:00:34.030 - 00:01:30.154, Speaker B: Sure. So I got involved in crypto initially, like many people with bitcoin, purchasing my first bitcoin and kind of diving deep into the rabbit hole of consensus and blockchains and proof of work. And then in a bigger way in 2016 with Ethereum, I had a friend who was very involved in the Ethereum ecosystem, and he was bringing me around to many crypto meetups and conferences. And I started to just really bend my mind a little bit about what was possible with smart contracts and things like that. And then in 2017, I raised money for adapt that I was building VC funded, and we tried to go build something that was different. It was essentially solving misinformation online on a blockchain. But I think what we realized quite quickly what a lot of people realized, that a lot of the infrastructure to build those type of dapps wasn't quite ready at the moment.
00:01:30.154 - 00:02:19.298, Speaker B: There was no uniswap. I don't think there was really a chain link mainnet available. It was very difficult to do that. In addition, even just the way Metamask was set up was so much harder to swap tokens after that. Took a step back and evaluated the, evaluated the space and was looking for layer one chains after that fiasco where I realized that Ethereum wasn't going to be able to scale, and avalanche is one that was on my radar since the paper dropped. The avalanche consensus paper dropped and so had the opportunity a few months ago, that's called four months ago, to join avalabs. My role as the director of DeFi focused on building out the Defi ecosystem here and really getting that engine roaring.
00:02:19.298 - 00:02:24.730, Speaker B: So I've been working on a few things, and obviously avalanche Rush is one of them.
00:02:24.890 - 00:02:53.090, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's talk about avalanche Rush. What was the thought process behind the 10 million token avalanche rush program? And I guess there's a follow up question on, like, when the initial avalanche rush was announced, it said $180 million. Right. But to be more specific, it was more like 10 million avalanche tokens. Right. So I guess every day the price changes, but that's like one clarification that my audience wanted to keep.
00:02:54.030 - 00:03:02.704, Speaker B: Yeah, we've allocated 10 million AVox for the program and. Yeah. So that's kind of how the program is going to work.
00:03:02.862 - 00:03:19.120, Speaker A: Yeah. So did you take inspiration from Polygon when you designed this? Because it's pretty similar to what Polygon did. Right. Just like have Albion curb come over and then incentivize that, and then as more and more people bridge liquidity, then partner up with more projects.
00:03:19.460 - 00:03:50.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a good point. No, I mean, for sure we took inspiration from Polygon. For sure we took inspiration from compound and others before us in terms of liquidity mining. But like, providing incentives for users to try your product is something that's been around in the world for a long time. I always use the example of Uber giving out free $30 rides. And I would have never tried Uber had I not like, used ten of those. So I think.
00:03:50.478 - 00:04:42.142, Speaker B: And then Lyft came and did the same thing. Right. So there's many ways for platforms, especially marketplace platforms that have two sides, to use incentives to at least let people try what they've built. So with avalanche, and with avalanche rush, more specifically, the Avalanche foundation, set aside a certain amount of tokens to really focus on DeFi, focus on incentivizing DeFi on the platform and show its commitment toward Defi. But also, I think the timing of it was very important. A new bridge was just released about two to three weeks ago for which we believe the UX and UI is something that doesn't exist for other bridges around the ecosystem in crypto. And because of that, we felt that that's one thing that was very important.
00:04:42.142 - 00:05:40.650, Speaker B: Also, our first lending platform went live, and that was Benke a few weeks ago. That did very well. But part of the reason that avalanche kind of didn't have, I guess, soaring success in Defi prior to these things is some of the pieces weren't there. We didn't have chain link made until a month ago. And then once we had that, other pieces fell in place, like a lending platform and then a good bridge. So the combination of good bridging, Chainlink, Oracles, and a lending capacity brought around the right time to launch avalanche rush. And just to get to your question, I think a lot of people in this space and other spaces really look at what ideas are out there and try and decide, is this the best way to approach this problem and maybe they take pieces of what other people have done and iterate.
00:05:40.650 - 00:05:54.950, Speaker B: And I think that's what we're doing in this specific program. We've only announced a very small snippet of avalanche, Raj, so far. So, you know, I think there's going to be a lot of iteration on incentive programs in general.
00:05:56.370 - 00:06:21.120, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Like, when I, when Avalanche first caught my eye, it was because when I saw the announcement of Benki being, I think it was like live on August 19 or something. And I'm a huge money markets guy, and I knew that, like, once, like, a trusted money market comes online, like, liquidity is going to flow through the bridge and, yeah, I think the bridge is like one of the best bridges I've ever used. It's just like, it's cheap, right? It's even coming from Ethereum and it's pretty fast.
00:06:21.740 - 00:07:02.310, Speaker B: So that also, like, messaging, also like messaging matters, right? Like ux of the bridge. Like, I don't know about you, but in crypto in general, you know, especially on the Ethereum side, I'm always weary when there's no messaging going on when I'm sitting there hanging on my transaction. So to have good ux and letting you know, like, hey, this is the confirmations. This is where you sit right now. And then at the end of the bridging experience, you get brought to this ecosystem page, which kind of gives you an idea of what's on the avalanche ecosystem. But you also get a little bit of a Vox airdrop to you so that you can make your first transaction. That's another user experience issue for a lot of people.
00:07:03.050 - 00:07:30.328, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I agree with the user experience part because when I bridge from matic to ethereum, like, the UI and the UX is like, okay, like, we're, like, we're processing your bridge. It's going to take 45 minutes to 3 hours, so please wait. And I'm like, okay. Like, I guess I have no idea, like, when it's going to come, but with your bridge, it's like, I can see, like, okay, like, up to 35 confirmations. I'm only, I'm on like, number ten, et cetera. It's pretty fast, so that's definitely cool.
00:07:30.328 - 00:07:40.746, Speaker A: So did the, like, the surprise of Benki surprise you by any chance? Because it definitely surprised me. I mean, I, I knew it would do well, but not like, whoa, that's a lot attention.
00:07:40.818 - 00:08:27.734, Speaker B: I mean, I think it was really a culmination of things, of how well did, I had no doubt in terms of the success of the team and being able to deliver. We've known the team for a while and feel strongly about their capabilities, but obviously the timing of their launch was very beneficial. We just launched a new bridge and we launched this program which got people excited or announced this program which got people excited. So. And plus we also, they were the first participant in avalanche rush with 3 million in Avox incentives. So, you know, I think the success was maybe, was definitely, definitely more than I anticipated. But, you know, I don't think we expected it to kind of crawl along.
00:08:27.734 - 00:08:54.579, Speaker B: The ecosystem has been begging for a lending platform for a long time. So this is much anticipated for native avalanche users. And one thing that's really interesting about natives, we have a lot of users on avalanche that actually have never tried Ethereum and they just welcome into the avalanche ecosystem directly. And so I think that's something that's not completely understood from outside of our ecosystem.
00:08:55.199 - 00:09:43.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I see, I see. Yeah, I mean, when I started my YouTube channel, I kind of like my channel blew up because of polygon. And a bunch of people that never use Ethereum didn't want to use Ethereum because of the gas fees, tried out defi for the first time on polygon and that's how they got into defi and fell in love. Contrary to popular beliefs, I feel like most people don't really use ETH right now, especially the high gas fees. I know L2 is coming soon, but in the meantime, other l one options like Avax is definitely, definitely good. So speaking of money markets, I think the number one question my audience is curious about is like, when are they incurred? Because I think avalanche Rush was announced a week or two ago, but I guess there was never like a timeline. I guess we know it's coming and we know it's all going to be, we know it's going to be great.
00:09:43.574 - 00:09:48.210, Speaker A: But can you give any estimates on when that's going to be live?
00:09:48.990 - 00:10:20.166, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, I think, pretty sure my mentions on Twitter is like the question I get every 36 seconds. No, it's a good question. It's a fair question. And what I will say, and what I can say is that we will let users know in advance when they will deploy in terms of a date and give specific timing around it. So we will do that. In terms of timing, I would say it's a few weeks out is what I can give. There's just some integration being completed.
00:10:20.166 - 00:11:17.736, Speaker B: It's really not much and some testing going on. It's just a matter of getting that kind of ironed out and making sure that this is the one thing in crypto, everybody gets very excited. And I understand it all because I've obviously been around the space for a while, too, so I do, too. But what we've tried to do, and the bridge is a good example, is give ourselves the greatest chance, or avalanche has given itself the greatest chance of success for the moment when it arrives. And the way to do that is to do as much as you can in the preparation and planning and testing to make this go off as smooth as possible is ideal. And I think what happened was a lot of people had tried Benki, Trader Joe, other application, Pangolin, other applications in Avalanche. And I think that what they really liked was the user experience of using avalanche fast finality.
00:11:17.736 - 00:11:55.170, Speaker B: It's something that we've been talking about, but until you actually get to use it, and in Defi, something in particular where you're doing like ten transactions very quickly, one after the other, finality matters. You don't want to be sitting around waiting to know whether or not your transaction went through. That's not fun for anybody. So people got excited about using avalanche, and that's a good thing. That's the point of avalanche rush, and I think they're going to be really excited when Aave Curve, sushi and the others, and we announced Powerswap today are going to be deploying. So, yeah, it's coming very quickly. It's top of mind.
00:11:55.170 - 00:12:02.770, Speaker B: We'll provide a full date and time for when it's going to happen, but it's not very far off at all.
00:12:03.390 - 00:12:23.480, Speaker A: That's good to hear. I feel like everyone in crypto, I mean, everything in crypto, things happen so fast in the space that people have very, very, like, low patience levels. I guess it's just like when all they went curve, I need it now. We're low on dopamine, but, yeah, like, I mean, for sure, like, safety testing. That's all, that's all important.
00:12:23.860 - 00:12:27.308, Speaker B: Yeah, the other thing, the other thing, just to, just to piggyback real quick off that.
00:12:27.404 - 00:12:27.868, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:27.964 - 00:12:35.588, Speaker B: Avalanche rush, and an avalanche in particular is like, for us, a long term, a long term vision.
00:12:35.644 - 00:12:35.884, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:35.932 - 00:13:20.090, Speaker B: Avalanche rush is not just a three month kind of flash in the pan incentive program, just trying to spike utility. It's going to be iterate. It's going to be deployed in phases. Those phases are going to be, you know, the first phase is around three months, and we'll kind of be able to then see where the chips lie. But what's important for us and for everybody to understand is this is not a, you know, just short term type of program. We're thinking about the long term here for the chain. And we believe avalanche is well suited as a layer one technology to kind of, to really solve a lot of people's needs as crypto and blockchains go.
00:13:21.430 - 00:14:02.200, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So I guess, like when, I guess, like most recently, like there has been announcements of like, phantom and Celo announcing liquidity mining programs. And Celo is really similar to, I guess, Avax and Polygon, just like liquidity mining programs. But I think Phantom has a really interesting, I guess, concept of instead of giving tokens away to users, we'll give it to the developers and they can decide what to do. So have you ever thought about potentially using as part of avalanche rush, giving, I guess, rewards to developers that want to build, like avalanche, native projects on Avax?
00:14:02.940 - 00:14:50.540, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, I saw those and it's good to see that there's others who agree with the idea of using incentives and deploying them as a way to get people to choose to try their chain. And let's not forget that that's the most important thing. At the end of the day, this is a user and developer acquisition type of program. So the technology needs to be good, the bridging needs to be good for people to stay. But it's interesting, there's that narrative that the phantom program is specifically only to developers, whereas it's strange to me because our program is going to allocate a large amount to native projects. Native projects are developers.
00:14:50.540 - 00:15:25.342, Speaker B: We've announced Aave Curve, sushi, PowerSwap. There's, you know, Benki is obviously a native project. So in that respect, we've definitely reward, you know, incentivized their launch very successfully. So, you know, and there's, there's no reason for anybody to believe that that's not going to continue in terms of native. We've also announced Avalanche and yay games. Avalanche also being a native project as well. So there's going to be native projects that are going to be incentivized.
00:15:25.342 - 00:16:11.380, Speaker B: And the best way to ensure success, especially when you have a native project that is innovative and is doing something special, is after their launch, incentivize it with rewards. So I think that kind of puts everybody in a sweet spot of the most innovative projects that come on avalanche, you should come build here because we will reward your launch. And I think the tying this to a metric that is backward looking is complicated in production to actually implement from my perspective, but just the narrative in general, I think that this is only for users, not developers, is definitely inaccurate.
00:16:11.760 - 00:16:28.548, Speaker A: Got it, got it, got it. Yeah. And I definitely agree. I feel like you have to reward, like, native projects, because if everything, like an ecosystem does is just, I guess, pay all in curb and sushi, it just becomes east L2. Right. It's really hard to differentiate.
00:16:28.604 - 00:16:29.684, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:16:29.812 - 00:16:52.070, Speaker A: But if you do have native projects that are thriving, ideally on Avax, maybe pangolin or Trader Joe is doing more swap volume than sushi. Right. I mean, sushi is great, but it'll be nicer to have native projects be more successful because that's part of the experience, right, of like, using different ecosystems.
00:16:52.410 - 00:17:46.900, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Like, I mean, at the end of the day, Aave has a strong community. You know, curve is a very strong community, and so does sushi. And like I said, part of this program, number one, is, so people try our chain, right? Want to boost activity on the chain of, and by incentivizing their communities to come over and try it, that's one way of getting liquidity users on the chain, which we can then use incentives on native projects to benefit from. You need to think about things holistically and also how they work in motion at different steps. And I think that's what's really important, because if we just do native projects, that's fine, that's possible. But then we don't get to leverage some of the existing communities and really great users that have been around in crypto for a very long time.
00:17:48.160 - 00:18:01.152, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I feel like Aave and curve are like musts for like, a new ecosystem, especially because curve, like, helps stable coins keep its pedig and facilitate, like, swap and liquidity too.
00:18:01.216 - 00:18:02.000, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:02.040 - 00:18:33.622, Speaker A: And Aave is like, everyone loves Aave. It's just the highest TVL. I know a bunch of people that wants, that wants to use avalanche, but there's a waiting on Aave. There's a bunch of people like that. So that's definitely going to be a bullish catalyst. So in terms of, I guess we talked about, like, getting people from other communities try out avalanche, et cetera. But I guess with Phantom and Ceelo announcing their liquidity mining incentives, like, how does that avalabs team plan to compete for mindshare among the Defi participants? Right.
00:18:33.622 - 00:18:56.420, Speaker A: Because crypto is so small, and I feel like theres, frankly, not too many people in Defi right now. So you kind of have to compete for eyeballs attention and you have to fight for their liquidity. So how do you plan on, I guess because right now I feel like avalanche is top of mind, but how do you, I guess, plan to stay that way right. And keep liquidity within the Avax ecosystem?
00:18:56.840 - 00:19:40.324, Speaker B: No, thats a good question and I dont think theres one clear silver bullet answer. I think its all things happening at once. Right. Like our business development team doing a good job of finding the most innovative projects and making sure we support them, not just from a funding perspective or incentive perspective, but also, you know, making introductions throughout the community and making sure we give them the best probability of success. That's one thing we can do. We also, you know, have this incentive program that we can use, like I said, to bootstrap launches of these various projects. And we're also going to be working on some hackathons and, you know, in person events, conferences and things like that to continue to build the community.
00:19:40.324 - 00:20:26.236, Speaker B: We also have many other initiatives in house. You know, I think before Avalanche Rush was announced, there was, you know, somewhat of a sentiment that there wasn't much going on and, you know, from, from us, you know, inside of the team there was. We kind of just wanted to line up the pieces appropriately. And I think that methodical approach is something that you can expect from us and maybe something that isn't so common in crypto. We try to do our best to be professional about dates, to be professional about timing of things, and to be professional about having primitives set up when the time comes to actually have the users have the best possible experience that they can, uh, given the timing that we have.
00:20:26.428 - 00:20:41.120, Speaker A: Yeah, most definitely. I guess like, uh, going off on a tangent, like how, how big is the evil apps team? Uh, like, and like how big? I guess the second part of the question is, like, how big is your defi team? Right. Uh, I was curious.
00:20:41.660 - 00:21:08.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, Ava labs in general, I believe, I believe is over 100 people. I don't have the exact number. Um, in terms of the team, the BD team, you know, we're where I think trying to count. I think we're like ten or so. But the avalanche community as a whole is kind of very close knit, so to speak. There's a lot of people that, and this is great to see. Great to see.
00:21:08.830 - 00:21:55.920, Speaker B: Right. Ava labs in particular can only and will only do so much. Right. Like this is a decentralized ecosystem and that's really something that we believe very strongly in. For example, avalanche as a chain has over 1000 validators, something that I don't think really any other chain can say that we believe in decentralization from a validated perspective, but we also believe in it from a actual community perspective. We're really trying to incentivize and try to grow the community such that these things kind of happen. And it's actually interesting to see that it's been happening, especially since the launch of the announcement of Avalanche Rush.
00:21:55.920 - 00:22:24.314, Speaker B: There's a lot of projects that are just deploying without us even knowing. That's great to see. From my perspective, it's ideal, frankly. We gave out an application for some, for natives to submit a, to actually be part of avalanche Rush. And you know, I was going through it this morning with some of the team and I didn't know half of them or maybe even 75% of the names. Right. So that's good to see.
00:22:24.314 - 00:22:33.670, Speaker B: Right. You know, we don't want to be this closed off, centralized entity. We want to be decentralized and we want the community to grow organically.
00:22:34.970 - 00:22:54.144, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's actually bullish. Like if you, if you're like getting a applications from a bunch of projects that you've never heard of because that means people are building on it. Right. Maybe devs are coming from Polygon eth or something, but I mean, there's no way to know. But that's definitely good because I mean, incentive programs work, right. It's just like a marketing tool, I guess.
00:22:54.144 - 00:23:16.920, Speaker A: But obviously, like no ecosystem, like no foundation can like keep doing it in perpetuity. So want organic growth, you need organic growth. And you know that. That's good to hear, I guess, to. I have a couple of final questions, but what are you most excited about, let's say, for the rest of the year, when it comes to crypto, defi avalanche, anything that suits your fancy?
00:23:18.860 - 00:24:15.678, Speaker B: It's a good question. One of the things I'm very excited about is seeing some evolution in Amms in general, in terms of this is just, doesn't matter which ecosystem it happens on, but just from my perspective on what gets you excited, I don't love the UX of an LP having to supply two tokens. In traditional finance, this is not something that you necessarily have to do. Big banks, they have inventories and are able to hedge exposures across assets. I think whoever figures out a protocol that can do that on itself, by itself, will actually be the most used Amm in the future. To me, that's very exciting. That can actually have a chance of replacing essential limit order book because from an efficiency perspective, essential limit order books, in my opinion, are much more efficient, but they're hard to do.
00:24:15.678 - 00:25:06.416, Speaker B: But hard to do in a decentralized way. So, yeah, I'm excited for innovation on that space. I know there's teams working on that. Apart from what exists at the moment. I'm also very excited in terms of us in kind of seeing how this avalanche rush program can natively, what kind of native and exciting projects can come out of this and what native and exciting things we can do with the incentives. So that's something else. I know there's staking contracts that exist that people have used and are tried and true and tested, but I think if we learn anything about DeFi and crypto, it's that there's innovation that can happen at the smart contract level and ways to deploy incentives that are more material and better for users.
00:25:06.416 - 00:25:36.038, Speaker B: Right now, everybody, yeah. Right now it seems like everybody is really incentivized. For TVL, that's been like kind of the focus. It's interesting, right? Like you have transactions on chain and a lot of these change, like avalanche burn fees. So it's also interesting to wonder whether or not I, uh, transactions will be incentive incentivized in the future. So there's a lot of different things to figure out and kind of, um, learn. And then that's what I'm excited about.
00:25:36.038 - 00:25:39.170, Speaker B: Incentives really fascinated me. Uh, in general.
00:25:39.590 - 00:25:52.126, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the way, yeah. The, the last thing you mentioned was pretty interesting because I believe like whenever like, is like all of Avax, like that I use for transactions burned or was it like a part of it? Uh, because I know it's being burnt, but. Okay.
00:25:52.158 - 00:25:52.302, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:52.326 - 00:25:54.690, Speaker A: So incentivize validators.
00:25:55.030 - 00:26:05.050, Speaker B: Yeah, there's no validators like taking your Avax fees as a rewards. Right. Like it just goes to be burned and collectively shared. Much more democratic of a process.
00:26:05.350 - 00:26:28.940, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's definitely interesting. So I guess incentivizing transactions on Avax is good for, I guess, Avax token holders. And I mean, I feel like most people, they care about price going up and it does kind of matter. Like if the price is doing well, then it's just like people are more interested in it naturally.
00:26:30.080 - 00:27:01.370, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, systems are reflexive, but yeah, it's not only a price thing from my perspective, it's also just incentivizing different type of usage. Total value locked is one thing, it doesn't mean it's the only thing. But I do think that total value locked is like a metric that you want to have at a certain. There's like a threshold that you want to have, you want to be a chain that has, is carrying a decent amount of value that shows that people have faith in the chain.
00:27:02.350 - 00:27:31.220, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess higher TVL means, like, more usage rights. Like, if curb has a bunch of TVL, then that means that, you know, there's a bunch of swaps happening between stable coins and whatnot, which is obviously good for the ecosystem. So one last question I have for you is, like you said, you've been in crypto for a relatively long time and you're the Defi guy. So is there like, what's the most degen thing you've done when it comes to crypto or defi, if you can answer that question.
00:27:33.360 - 00:28:01.038, Speaker B: Oh, Mandy, that's a good question. Let me think. What can, what am I allowed to say here? I'll say what the dumbest thing I've done is. Okay, yeah, and this is before Defi even existed, so we can go back to that. But I owned a bunch of bitcoin back in the day. Really a large amount. When I was working on Wall Street.
00:28:01.038 - 00:28:24.512, Speaker B: I worked with Citigroup as a trader, traded like credit default swaps and things like that. And I was super interested in bitcoin because it's like the integration of, it's like intersection of markets and economics. And that's kind of where all my intention is. Spanned my life. And so I dove down the rabbit hole and I was like, oh, I'm going to buy a bunch of this. And I did. And it went from like, I don't know, 200 to like, 1200.
00:28:24.512 - 00:29:36.810, Speaker B: And then this is like Mount Gox days, I believe. And then Apple Pay was announced and I sold all my bitcoin because I thought that apple Pay was going to eat all the bitcoin worlds. And it just goes to show how much I misunderstood the thesis at the time. And what's also pretty interesting about that is it did go straight down to $100 or something like that. So for a moment I thought I was a genius and then was very, very quickly reminded and reminded every day how much I missed a the thesis. And I think what I think one thing to take away from that just, you know, not to, not to get too serious or anything, but, you know, everybody assumes that, like, what's happening at this second and at this time in crypto is like, what's going to happen for, like, the next year? But if you actually think back, like, every year, something totally different than nobody anticipated continues to happen. And so, like, that's why I think, you know, having the right foundation of things and then evaluating the space as a whole is the right approach, rather than just looking at what exists right now and worried about week to week what's going to happen.
00:29:37.350 - 00:30:00.650, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I think we're all. I think when it comes to holding on the assets with volatile assets that are as volatile as crypto, we all get caught up in, like, short term price fluctuations, like, whatever's happening right now, right today. But if you take a longer term mindset about everything, then things become more clear and it's easier to build conviction.
00:30:01.070 - 00:30:11.166, Speaker B: And that's not only a crypto thing that happens in traditional markets. I can attest to that. A lot of people kind of do the same. I mean, everybody saw the AMC and GameStop fiasco.
00:30:11.278 - 00:30:25.030, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, this has been a great conversation. Luigi, thank you for being on the channel. So for anyone that wants to, like, hear from you, like, where can they find you? Like, do you have a Twitter or where's the.
