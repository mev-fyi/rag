00:00:00.440 - 00:00:21.286, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taki here. And in this video I wanted to go over my 2022 predictions. It's the new year, right? I thought it'd be fun to do this. I'll mostly be focusing on Q one, just because it's easier to predict things out in the near term than it is in long term. And also, this is how Brenda might form. And keep in mind, none of this financial advice, I'll most likely get 99% of things wrong. But you know, it's fun, right? It's fun.
00:00:21.286 - 00:00:38.322, Speaker A: And who knows? Maybe in twelve months we look back on this and I'm like, damn, I was such an idiot. Or maybe I'm like, oh, wow, like I got some things right. I'm not going to make any obvious predictions, right. These predictions on other videos and other, I guess, Twitter threads. But like, you know, stable coin issuance to go up. Of course. Duh.
00:00:38.322 - 00:00:40.594, Speaker A: Like, of course, right. That's going to happen.
00:00:40.642 - 00:00:40.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:41.082 - 00:00:44.562, Speaker A: No one gains value from here and that more institutional capital, Defi users go up.
00:00:44.586 - 00:00:44.746, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:44.778 - 00:01:20.470, Speaker A: I mean, of course, right. I'll try to make more bold claims like how a bear market might form, how ETH will like lose more market share, things like that, just because it's more fun that way. Anyways, this is the agenda. I'll talk about ETH TvL dominance, Q one rotations discussing the near ecosystem, how a bear market might form, other one off predictions in a summary. So first of all, before I get into it, you know, my first prediction is that 2022 my channel will grow to 100,000 subscribers, hopefully, right. I'm almost there. And I'll continue to add zero YouTube ads, zero page sales, zero ref links, anything, right.
00:01:20.470 - 00:01:28.710, Speaker A: You know, my estimated revenue is zero because I don't run ads, right. And it's going to continue that way. I'm not going to take any sponsorships. No, no ad money, right? No, like page shows.
00:01:28.790 - 00:01:29.006, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:29.038 - 00:01:50.646, Speaker A: I'm going to keep, keep that zero, right? Keep that zero. Okay, let's get into the real predictions for 2022 with crypto stuff, right? So ETH TVL dominance, I think, eats TvL dominance is gonna look a lot like the bitcoin dominance chart. Scaling for ETH is gonna take a long time. It's gonna happen, right. It's gonna be great when it happens, but it's gonna take a lot longer than people expect.
00:01:50.718 - 00:01:50.902, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:50.926 - 00:02:43.372, Speaker A: If you talk to the devs or I talk to the devs and, you know, like they have issues deploying on things like arbitrum and optimism because like the RPC's are just like not good, right? And I think it's gonna take a long time for ETH L2 to scale, right? And like I said, when it does scale, it's gonna be great, right? And I'm sure like a bunch of TvL is gonna go there, but, you know, don't listen to the EV Maxis. It's gonna say, oh yeah, scaling is gonna come soon. Scaling is right on the corner. Oh my God, so much innovation, so much technology. I mean, they're right in the sense that, you know, like the smartest people in the world are working on it, but they're wrong in a sense that it's gonna happen in the near term, okay? Because if you look back into 2021, I remember as a Defi noob, right, I was so heavy, I was like, early 2021, I was so heavy because optimism was saying, oh yeah, March, you know, March, we're going to launch optimism. It's going to be great, right? And I was like, okay, thank God, like I did, I didn't bridge the binary smart chain. I feel so bad.
00:02:43.372 - 00:03:34.114, Speaker A: I can finally use the EtH layer too, right? And then like, I think like a week before the announcement, right, or a week before they were supposed to launch, they were like, sorry, guys, we're going to push it back to July. And I was like, what? Okay. And that was like, when it hit me, like, okay, eth L2, it's best to just assume that it's not going to happen in the near term and be positive, be like pleasantly surprised when it does happen, right? So that's kind of how I'm thinking about it. And in the meantime, as eth scales slowly, right, other l one s are just going to continue to make, to take market share. And that this is, this has been my channel's thesis for all of 2021 and it's going to continue to be my thesis until it changes for 2022, right? Don't fight the trend because there's a reason it's a trend, right? At some point, the trend might stop and, or it might like lose loose steam, but you know, the trend is a trend. Don't fight the trend. So you go to D Phi llama.
00:03:34.114 - 00:04:09.958, Speaker A: This is going to be the TVL for all chains, right? Ethereum at roughly 60%. And if you look at to the right side, this is the EiD dominance, right? Where the green part is, eats TVL. And you can see that it's just like slowly going down, right? 2021 Binance smart chain launched, took a bunch of TVL and then other chains launched, and, you know, each TVL dominance, you know, at 60%, I'm sure it's gonna get below 50% at some point, right. Maybe. Maybe that's, like, not as crazy as people. Maybe that's not as crazy just because it's already at 60%, but I would assume it's gonna keep going down. And I make a comparison to the bitcoin dominance chart, right, because this is the bitcoin dominance chart.
00:04:09.958 - 00:04:14.576, Speaker A: This is bitcoin's market cap relative to the entire crypto market cap, it's roughly at 40%.
00:04:14.688 - 00:04:14.912, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:14.936 - 00:04:22.320, Speaker A: And you can see that, you know, initially, like, when there was, like, not that many other cryptos, bitcoin dominance was, like over 90%.
00:04:22.440 - 00:04:22.840, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:22.920 - 00:04:37.320, Speaker A: But as more cryptos began to launch, right, this is 2017, it went down, right. And in the bear market, it went back up. And in late 2020, it went up again. Right, when it went to, like 30,000, $40,000. Right, in that crazy roundup. But ever since then, it's going down. Right.
00:04:37.320 - 00:04:41.776, Speaker A: And I would kind of expect this shape to occur for its tbo dominance.
00:04:41.808 - 00:04:41.952, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:41.976 - 00:04:53.464, Speaker A: Maybe it gets to 40% or something. So putting it side by side, we see this, right. It kind of looks similar, right? I mean, it was like 90% up here, and then it had a crazy dump, small bounce. And this keeps trending down.
00:04:53.552 - 00:04:54.256, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:54.448 - 00:04:57.000, Speaker A: And I would assume that it's going to get below 50%.
00:04:57.160 - 00:04:57.648, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:57.744 - 00:05:24.928, Speaker A: And so I think it's good to bet on l one s that you think will keep taking a market share. L1 s that have a product, l ones with incentive programs, because those are the ones that you want to bet on to succeed in 2022. For q one, q two, q three, as long as it continues to ship slowly. And I'm not blaming them for shipping slowly because they have so much TVL, they have to be super careful with just l two and stuff. But it is what it is. It is what it is. This is reality.
00:05:24.928 - 00:05:46.402, Speaker A: This is reality. I still think ETh, the asset, will perform really, really well. However, the TVO dominance of ETH and its L2 is going to go down over time. ETh, Maxis will say, no, no, no. Like, people, people, like, love decentralization. They're gonna, you know, come to Ethereum once l two scales. But I don't really think that liquidity is as loyal as the Maxis think.
00:05:46.402 - 00:05:53.666, Speaker A: Okay, because it's all about the customer acquisition game. These incentive programs are a way for people or for these ecosystems to gather customers.
00:05:53.698 - 00:05:53.938, Speaker B: Right.
00:05:53.994 - 00:06:29.028, Speaker A: They're saying, hey, we'll pay you to use our ecosystem. And maybe if you're like decentralization Max from like 20 2016, 2017, yeah, maybe you're gonna have most of your money on Ethereum, right? Or if you have a lot of money, you're gonna just slip on Ethereum because, you know, you're gonna pay for, you're gonna pay a premium for that security. However, you know, if you think about the customer acquisition and like next billion users, or like, let's say 10 million users is gonna enter Defi, I would assume that over 70% is gonna go into other l one s. Okay. And I don't think that's like a crazy thought, right. Therefore, I believe l one s will continue to outperform other l ones.
00:06:29.044 - 00:06:29.316, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:29.388 - 00:07:10.066, Speaker A: Eth for the duration of the bull market. In a bear market, it will massively outperform. But in a bull market, you know, these scalable chains is going to be where most of the money will flow into because it's what, you know, retail users like you and I can actually use without feeling really, really bad. So that being said, I think that's a good foundation to go into my q one rotations and predictions, and I'll mostly be focusing on one ecosystem because, you know, I mean, it's fun to like, say like, oh, yeah, like five ecosystems are gonna pump this quarter. It's gonna be crazy. But, you know, like, I don't really do that stuff. I kind of just make concentrated bets and just focus my efforts on one ecosystem, one project, and one and one not, because I think it's a lot easier to manage one position or two positions than like ten different positions.
00:07:10.098 - 00:07:10.530, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:10.650 - 00:07:50.930, Speaker A: Concentrated bets over diversification. And the reason I think this way, and, you know, I'll talk about near, but, you know, I think I, if you, if you understand, like, the general sentiment around crypto and the market participants in crypto, like you and I, let's call us, let's call ourselves apes, right? If we're bridging money into metamask, into defi, you know, we kind of have to be an ape, you know, to begin with, right? Apes have the attention span of a goldfish, right? I mean, we have tiny brains. Well, maybe not you, but I have a tiny brain. Most successful farmers and traders will be those that are able to identify their rotations early and sell into the. Okay, and this kind of sounds bad, but I'll get into, like, why I think this is. Okay. So this is like actual data.
00:07:50.930 - 00:08:30.876, Speaker A: So this is avalanche. So I'll kind of go over like 2021 month by month to see, like, the rotations that happened, you know, throughout the year. And what I think is going to happen, you know, for 2022, right? So in August it was avalanche season, right? We went like from $10 to like, what is like $50 or actually it was like $6, right? Like it was crazy, right? Like, look at look at these candles. These are daily candles, right? Like, it's like so many green candles, right? So August was avantross month and then September and October was Phantom's month, right? Phantom went from like, what, thirty cents to three dollars. Like it's crazy, right. In two months, right? There's a lot of, there's a lot of volatility along the way. But, you know, the trend was up, right? And then it corrected.
00:08:30.876 - 00:08:33.852, Speaker A: And after it corrected, November was back to avalanche.
00:08:33.876 - 00:08:34.036, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:34.068 - 00:08:42.492, Speaker A: So essentially what cap capital flew from Avax, right. People made a bunch of money and then they're like, okay, let's rotate to Phantom, right? Made a lot of money, and then people rotated back to avalanche.
00:08:42.516 - 00:08:42.724, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:42.772 - 00:09:06.706, Speaker A: I, so it's, it feels like there's like not that many new money coming into the space. It's like money already in crypto. It's like a player versus player aspect where like traders or like the smart traders are like, are just outperforming because they're like early into rotations and whatnot. And then I guess December was Luna, right. But you can argue that. I mean, since July, Luna was up only, right. It went from five dollars to one hundred dollars from since July.
00:09:06.706 - 00:09:34.272, Speaker A: It was pretty crazy, right? So, you know, these all ones just outperform. And you can kind of see how there's always, like the flavor of the month, right. And this is because, you know, first of all, I don't think there's like new money coming into this space that's kind of bearish, to be honest. But, you know, that, I think that's, that's one of the reasons. But also, you know, it's crypto is driven on narratives and, you know, whatever is being shielded that month is going to go up. I think so. And if you think back about, you know, like why avax and why Phantom.
00:09:34.336 - 00:09:35.120, Speaker B: Pumped a lot, right.
00:09:35.160 - 00:09:48.072, Speaker A: And Phantom is pumping, like this year, too. And, you know, I've been bullish phantom, like, in all this time and whatnot. But, you know, the point I'm trying to make here is that people don't really care about like, avalanche Rush and the phantom incentive program anymore, right? I mean, they still exist.
00:09:48.176 - 00:09:48.416, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:48.448 - 00:10:08.944, Speaker A: And that's one of the reasons why these ecosystems are doing really, really well. But I argue that these incentive programs have already been priced in, at least the hype for it. And I feel like, you know, when it comes to next rotations, it's going to be where that hype has not been made obvious, right. And I'm sure, I mean, you know, I made this tweet last night. I'm like, hey, like, guys, like, the next rotation is near. Does anyone know which one it is?
00:10:09.032 - 00:10:09.304, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:09.352 - 00:10:32.780, Speaker A: And I think, I think I had like 200 comments and it was everyone showing their own badges, like, oh, it's phantom. It's one, it's Adam, it's Solana, it's Luna, it's avax. But little did, like, little did people know it's, it's right there. The next rotation is literally near, at least in my opinion, not financial advice. Hopefully I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but I'll give my reasons why. Okay, so this is near. This is the price of near.
00:10:32.780 - 00:10:58.814, Speaker A: I started making this slide a week ago. So I think the price is up, like to $17 or something. But, you know, I think Nair has been on a clear uptrend. You know, it's a bullish market. And I can, I expect this to continue. I expect this to continue. So, you know, I think if you look back into one of my October videos, right, on October 25, the NIer protocol offered, or this, they announced this $800 million incentive program for Defi mindshare, right.
00:10:58.814 - 00:11:03.782, Speaker A: And 250 million in the red box in ecosystem grants that's going to be distributed over four years.
00:11:03.806 - 00:11:03.942, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:03.966 - 00:11:20.264, Speaker A: So. Four years. Long time. But, you know, I think they announced this one, like, near was like $7 or something. So, you know, it's, you can do the math. I think it's like a $500 million ecosystem grant at this point. Or maybe they're gonna, like, you know, maybe they're gonna just do 250 million from, from the current price.
00:11:20.264 - 00:11:20.976, Speaker A: I have no idea.
00:11:21.008 - 00:11:21.152, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:21.176 - 00:11:25.592, Speaker A: I mean, these, these foundations do all sorts of weird things, but you know the money is coming.
00:11:25.656 - 00:11:26.000, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:26.080 - 00:11:33.730, Speaker A: It's more about, we know the money is coming, but when is it gonna come? Right. Because Hedera Hashgraph also announced like a billion dollars of the program.
00:11:33.770 - 00:11:33.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:34.042 - 00:11:42.434, Speaker A: But we know that's not coming anytime soon. Algorand announced like an $800 million program or something. But we know that's not going to come anytime soon. But why do. So, like, why do I think near is next?
00:11:42.482 - 00:11:42.642, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:42.666 - 00:12:25.714, Speaker A: Why do I think near is going to be the, the most what is this like, like the quickest rotation, I guess, right? It's going to happen in the short term. Well, if you look into this video, right? So I mean, I've been, I watched a bunch of like the videos on like nears YouTube channel, right? I mean this video has like 100 views, right? So no one watches these things. But if you watch these things, right, if you actually spend time watching these things, reading articles, there's a lot of alpha to be had. So November 17, this guy Kendall Cole was like, okay, like, you know, these products are going to launch soon on Aurora, right? So I'll talk about Aurora later. But you know, think of Nier as the layer one and Aurora as L2, right? But you know, these are coming to Aurora, you know, dodo, Sushi, Kyber curve, and hopefully more.
00:12:25.762 - 00:12:26.350, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:26.650 - 00:12:48.650, Speaker A: It's coming soon. Dodo already launched, actually. So I took the screenshot like last week, but you can already see that this, there's already incentives for Dodo, right? This is a decentralized exchange. Dodo is a farm token. So I wouldn't get too excited about these aprs. But you can see that, you know, near incentives already live, right? So you can kind of infer that, okay, no, the ecosystem is being built, right. It's EVM.
00:12:48.650 - 00:12:53.354, Speaker A: So it's easy to build apps. You know, the gas is super free or the gas is super cheap.
00:12:53.402 - 00:12:53.538, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:53.554 - 00:13:06.218, Speaker A: It's going to be cheap right now. It's free. I'll talk about that later. It's actually free. You know, newer incentives are coming online. So, you know, it gives me hope. And I guess I'll look into, I guess q one that, okay, these incentives are coming out.
00:13:06.218 - 00:13:16.962, Speaker A: It's EVM. So, you know, it's, it's gonna be relatively quick for other applications to deploy on near. And this is a quote from Alex, Alex Shevchenko, who is the CEO of Aurora.
00:13:17.066 - 00:13:17.402, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:17.466 - 00:13:21.772, Speaker A: And Aurora and Nirdan, um, they're not the same project, but you know, they like work closely together.
00:13:21.836 - 00:13:22.204, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:22.292 - 00:13:47.652, Speaker A: Near is the layer one and Aurora is the L2. Built on top of near is not EVM compatible. Aurora is EVM compatible. Okay. And no blockchain project at this point in time is able to survive without any liquidity mining or incentive program. As such, aura allows us plenty to propose to the Aura Dao to launch a liquidity mining program. Okay, so I'm not sure if this is the same thing as the near incident program, but Aurora, they also have their own token.
00:13:47.652 - 00:14:41.976, Speaker A: They're also going to do incentive program at some point, right? And like I mentioned, near is all one aura is nearest, L2, right? And the fact that it's EVM is super important, right? Because if you think about rotations or if you're like a rotator or like a trader or a farmer or whatever, timing does matter, right? If you're holding like, bitcoin or eth or like, avax or something for the long term, like, sure. Like, who cares about timing the markets, right? You just hold them long term, let it go up and be happy when you're like, agenda age 50 or something, or like 40 or 30, whatever. But EVM is important just because in terms of user adoption and customer acquisition, it's a lot easier to get people to, you know, use metamask and bridge to, like, an EVM chain than it is to, you know, force someone to make a wallet from scratch. I tried making a wallet on near. You have to have near to, like, make the wallet, which doesn't, doesn't really make sense to me. So there's like, this huge barrier to entry there. Like Algorand.
00:14:41.976 - 00:14:59.768, Speaker A: You have to make your own wallet some. There's, like, barrier to entry. You have to kyc the bridge and stuff. I mean, like, you know, there's barriers to entry for non EVM chains. So, you know, it's easier to bet on EVM chains in the short term just because you can kind of see, like, you know, when the, when and where the adoption will occur. So gas fees are currently zero. It's actually zero.
00:14:59.768 - 00:15:25.452, Speaker A: Like, I encourage everyone to, like, you know, start bridging there, like maybe like 1% of portfolio, start using it just because I think the user experience is pretty, pretty, pretty amazing, actually. And, you know, gas phase being zero, it might not sound like that great about that crazy of a value proposition to you, right? Because you go to harmony, you go to polygon, avalanche, phantom. I mean, the gas fees are like, pretty low, right? However, the fact that it's zero makes it so that, you know, you don't have to think about gas.
00:15:25.556 - 00:15:25.796, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:25.828 - 00:15:42.312, Speaker A: You can just keep clicking buttons. It makes the defi experience that much better. It's going to be turned on at some point, I expect later this month or in February, right. I have some details on why I think this is. But even if they turn it on, I hear it's gonna be pennies, right? It's gonna be pennies. So TVL growth is strong and bridging is important. Bridges.
00:15:42.312 - 00:16:14.722, Speaker A: The, the rainbow bridge is good, right? Their native bridge. They also have bridge from, I believe, multi chain, which is formally, any swap and synapse. And the Terra bridge, I believe. Or maybe not the Terra bridge, but, you know, you can use synapse, I think, for a bunch of chains. And like I mentioned, you know, this bridge, right? I believe most of the alpha in crypto comes from bridging. I think a lot of people just get complacent and there's a state in one ecosystem, and they just, like, you know, find the community, and they just, like, you know, like, get in a. Get in, like, a circle and just, like, chant each other like, oh, yeah, like, our bags will go up only.
00:16:14.722 - 00:16:38.438, Speaker A: But, you know, in crypto, you have to overmanned, right? Like, because how you make money is by being early and how you be. How you. How you're early is by spreading to ecosystems. I mean, I get. I get a lot of questions about, like, how I found defi kingdoms. It's literally as simple as I bridged to harmony in September when no one else cared about harmony, right? And, like, literally, like, defi kingdoms was, like, the only project that looked interesting. So I just, like, you know, invested in it, right? So it's.
00:16:38.438 - 00:16:56.584, Speaker A: It's like, it's pretty. It's pretty simple, actually. You just have to keep up with the bridging. You have to keep up with the new ecosystems and just try out these ecosystems yourself. There's like, what? Like, there's so many ecosystems. Like, so, like, you know, I don't encourage everyone to, like, bridge everywhere. However, you can kind of, you know, use common sense to determine where you should bridge and why you should bridge, right.
00:16:56.584 - 00:17:13.808, Speaker A: By just, like, reading articles. So, you know, this is a rainbow bridge, rainbowbridge app. It's pretty good, right? It's like, I think it's like $10 to bridge from ETH. Eth mainnet. Not too bad. A bunch of assets are supported, EtH stable coins, etcetera. This is a TVL growth on Aurora, right? So it's been up only.
00:17:13.808 - 00:17:41.184, Speaker A: I would. I would expect this to be in the top ten at some point. Terms of defy llama, right? I think they're like number 20 or something. I mean, over a billion then, you know, like, flip all, like, flip sean and stuff, right? I mean, like what? Okay. And also, I encourage everyone to subscribe to Aurora, their YouTube channel, because their CEO, Alex Shopchenko, he gives weekly updates on, like, what he's. What his team is doing, right? And, you know, I really like this guy. I mean, he definitely knows what he's doing.
00:17:41.184 - 00:18:10.244, Speaker A: And the thing that. The thing I like about Alex is that he's focused on building out an ecosystem, right? Other foundations, other teams, they're focused on like building bridges and like, you know, like, like doing random stuff. But aura, like, their goal is simple, right? We build a defi ecosystem. That's what I like. That's what a farmer like me likes. Okay? And in this ama, he gave a few interesting points. So around the nine minute mark he said we're going to do a secret launch of a big project in January, even if it gets delayed first half of Q one.
00:18:10.244 - 00:18:44.700, Speaker A: For sure. This thing is revolutionary and will change apps from the ground up with this new architecture. Until then, transactions will be free. So you know, gas will be free until maybe late January, maybe like early February, right? But even then, like, you know, it's, it's gonna, it's gonna be cheap. And also you're gonna be paying gas in ETH, right? You don't use Aurora or near token as gas. You use ETH as a gas. Because how it works is that, you know, when you, let's, let's say you pay a penny in ETH, right, for gas, what it does on the back end is it converts that ETH into near and uses that near for transaction fees.
00:18:44.700 - 00:19:48.352, Speaker A: So from a user experience perspective, it really feels like I'm using ETH L2, right, because I'm using ETH as gas and because of like this, the system, right, where it converts to near in the backend in the future, they're going to be, you'll be able to use like USDC, Dai, like any ERC 20 as gas, which I think is pretty crazy from a user experience perspective. It. And you know, in the 16 minutes and 32nd mark, he said any ecosystem without an ether scan partnership is not a tier one project partnership coming soon, right? So you know, this guy is focused on, you know, things like infuria, building out infuria for developers, etherscan for the user experience. I mean he's like, you know, he's, he's going, he's going hard. He's going hard for sure. And also one of the bullish points for NiR is that I'm not going to get into like the technical aspects of Nier, right? But you know, it's from the devs I've talked to and like the articles I've read, the developer experience on near is much better than other chains, right? So take that for what it's worth. So I'll link this in the description below, but John Wing has a pretty interesting Twitter thread on like his near thesis, which kind of goes more about like the tech.
00:19:48.416 - 00:19:48.640, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:48.680 - 00:20:04.122, Speaker A: For those that care about the tech, I care more about like capital flow. So I'm not really going to focus on this. But, you know, I'll put this in the description and there's like not that many apps on Aurora, right. And keep in mind, I keep saying Aurora, right. Because my focus is on aura, not near.
00:20:04.186 - 00:20:04.554, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:04.642 - 00:20:05.546, Speaker A: Not that, not the asset.
00:20:05.578 - 00:20:05.698, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:05.714 - 00:20:28.530, Speaker A: I'm sure the near token will do really well, but I'm more focused about like the chain Aurora. Okay. So, you know, just take that for what it's worth. And 60% of the TVL is on tricellaris, which is like the number one decentralized exchange automated market maker. They have partnership with Luna and UST. So, you know, most of the TVL is going to try Solaris. So if you're going to farm, I think this is the safest place to farm.
00:20:28.570 - 00:20:28.842, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:28.906 - 00:20:32.122, Speaker A: They also have a seed, they also have seeded liquidity from Dragonfly Capital.
00:20:32.186 - 00:20:32.386, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:32.418 - 00:20:41.674, Speaker A: So if a VC fund is, you know, providing liquidity on a particular application, you know, it lowers the chance of a risk or, sorry, it lowers the risk of a rug or an exploit. It could happen.
00:20:41.722 - 00:20:41.906, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:41.938 - 00:20:49.104, Speaker A: I mean, I have to keep saying this in crypto is risky, but, you know, it is what it is. There are other Defi applications, there are more on the risky side.
00:20:49.152 - 00:20:49.336, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:49.368 - 00:20:53.056, Speaker A: So I'm not going to talk about it in this video, but just go to defi llama, you'll find a list.
00:20:53.088 - 00:20:53.304, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:53.352 - 00:21:18.080, Speaker A: I mean, you can, you can kind of rewind back to here, right? There are all these protocols. No triceler, 60% of the Pbl. There are other amms, Launchpad, stable swap, et cetera. Okay, so talk about, talk about the market cap, right? So near has been. The thing is like Nir's already like a pretty expensive project, right. As in it's like a top 25 project. But I think it can go higher.
00:21:18.080 - 00:21:25.408, Speaker A: I think it can go higher with all the catalysts coming up and from the things I've read, right. And there's a bunch of articles online if you want to look into more.
00:21:25.464 - 00:21:25.656, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:25.688 - 00:21:35.496, Speaker A: So first of all, should flip algorithm, right? I mean, I mean, I don't think that's a, that's a crazy argument, right? It's already like 500 million additional market.
00:21:35.568 - 00:21:36.180, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:36.720 - 00:21:52.120, Speaker A: Let's get it there. I think it'll float Cosmos, right? I like Cosmos, but I think Nier has more going for them in the short term. You know, this. It is what it is. I think Nier will crypto.com coin, right. CRO, you know, I kind of talk down on CRO.
00:21:52.120 - 00:22:22.510, Speaker A: Not really. But you know, no one expects the Kronos chain to be like the future of finance, right? But the only thing going for them that they have going for them is like a bunch of marketing money for like, you know, buying the Staples center and like, you know, spending money on like sponsorships. So I wouldn't fade Crow, right. Because, you know, you don't want to fade marketing. But you know, let's flip Crow. And I think it, I think, you know, if, if I really want to make them eth maxis angry, I say let's flip polygon, right? I mean, eth maxis, they're saying polygon is the best thing ever. You know, it's centralized l two or side chain, whatever.
00:22:22.510 - 00:23:00.594, Speaker A: But it says flip it. And also I don't want to bet against the memes, right? I mean, like I don't ever want to get bet against Doge or Shiba, but like let's, let's flip like doge and Shiba, right? And maybe the flipping doesn't happen because, you know, near gets like $24 billion market captain. Maybe it just happens because Doe just like drops another 50% or something. Like Shiba also, right? But you know, I think Nier can get to the top 15, right? Top 15. It's not crazy upside, right? But I think the thing is like, you know, I'm saying like a nier could do a two x, right? In like Q one. If you say that to, like, anyone from the traditional markets, it's like, damn. Like, that's crazy.
00:23:00.594 - 00:23:15.956, Speaker A: Like this. That's a scam. But in crypto, it's like two x in Q one. That's lame. Come on, give me more dopamine. Right? That's kind of how people think of crypto. But so maybe it's not as exciting and maybe, you know, going into like all coins and stuff is like more fun.
00:23:15.956 - 00:23:45.622, Speaker A: But from a user adoption perspective, I think near Aurora tvl go up. I think aurora is going to have top ten tvl in q one, right? According to defi lemma. Okay, enough bull posting about Nier. Let's be more bearish. Let's be more bearish, right? Because every time I'm bullish, price goes down, whatever. And I'm actually quite bearish defi. And I know it's coming.
00:23:45.622 - 00:24:51.424, Speaker A: I know it's kind of weird coming from a full time farmer defi guy on YouTube, but honest thoughts, I'm not here to, I guess I kind of pumped near, but I'm not here to like, you know, just like pump everything, right? The goal is to be as honest as I can. So I'm pretty bearish midterm on Defi decentralized finance. And one of the reasons is if you look back on these previous notations, like these coins go up because of incentive programs, right? Most of DeFi is incentivized where foundations have to pay users to use the chain. When incentives run out, what happens? And the question is, right, incentive programs have been bullish, right, historically. But why is that? It's because these ecosystems need incentives to get people to use it, right? So I feel like as these incentives run out, there's going to be less incentive for me and other farmers and other users to use these chains, right? Because I love aave. I love aave, right? I love the idea, I love the future of Aave. But if it weren't for incentives, like, you know, I'll probably use Aave to a lesser extent than I do today.
00:24:51.424 - 00:25:39.970, Speaker A: Same goes for other, other applications. And if you think about it, like, most yields are high because there's a bunch of people bridging into the ecosystem to get like those rewards, right? But if you think about it, like, if those, if, let's say like the amount of people that bridge to defi goes down by 20%, right, then yields will automatically become lower because there's less activity in the chain. And sure, you might argue that, oh, yeah. Well, yields will get a, yields will be less diluted, so it's going to be higher. Well, maybe, right, for some applications, but I think for the majority of Defi there needs to be like a bunch of inflow from users in order for these like, projects to actually succeed. So maybe the yields are high to begin with, but because there's like not that much user adoption when these incentives aren't out, you know, maybe, you know, these ecosystems like don't do well. Maybe these applications don't do well, and maybe that's how a bear market starts.
00:25:39.970 - 00:26:00.576, Speaker A: Yes, these programs are expected to last a few years. The near one is going to last four years. I think avant rush is going to last like twelve months or something, or maybe longer. But I think all the excitement has been front loaded. It's like what I mentioned earlier, apes have the attention span of goldfish. No one cares about avalanche rush anymore. I mean, it's still there, it's great.
00:26:00.576 - 00:26:33.246, Speaker A: But that's not really a bold case for avalanche anymore. Phantom, same thing. It's doing well, but it's more about Andre and Danielle and Toom and stuff like that. It's not really about the incentives anymore. I think there needs to be more innovation instead of forking existing projects and throwing coins around and just hoping to buy low, sell high, et cetera, or buy high, sell higher, or something. Because I think one of the ways to onboard more users is better products, because right now, metamask, it's pretty hard to use. I know how to use it, obviously, but it's pretty hard to use.
00:26:33.246 - 00:26:55.460, Speaker A: It's going to be really difficult onboarding users. So I think there needs to be better infrastructure. There needs to be better products. Like, all loans are over collateralized, which is fine, right? But, you know, maybe there has to be. Maybe there's, like, a more capital efficient way to do so. Maybe there can be, like, better fee on ramps, right? Maybe centralized exchanges are good enough. But you know, what if there's, like, a mobile wallet and stuff, right? I mean, I think these things need to happen in order for Defi to become much bigger.
00:26:55.460 - 00:27:26.232, Speaker A: And for me, like, as a farmer, it feels like whenever I use Defi and I do this rotation thing, it kind of feels like musical chairs, right? It's like, okay, like, I'm early, then people bridge in, I sell. You know, people bridge out. People bridge into the new one. You know, like, we buy, we sell. You know, it's just like, we're just, like, flipping things, right? We're, like, flipping burgers. We're flipping burgers. And, like, we're not really, you know, staying into an ecosystem because we're bullish and actually, yes, yes, of course, of course there are, like, community members and, like, maxis for every chain and whatnot.
00:27:26.232 - 00:28:39.754, Speaker A: But I don't really see, like, parabolic growth in, like, defi adoption happening anytime soon just because, you know, the products aren't as good right now. So that's why I continue to say, like, short term bullish defi, long term bullish defi. But midterm, I don't know how to quantify what midterm is. But, you know, when these incentive programs run out or start to run out, I feel like Defi might be in for a bear market. And I feel like that's a more logical way to think about how a bear market might start, right? Because we often think about, like, oh, yeah, like, bear market starts when bitcoin dumps, but I feel like we're going to see more capital rotations or, like, you know, sector pumps and dumps, I guess, sector bull markets and bear markets, right? Gaming, defi, bitcoin, stuff like that. So, you know, it's really hard to put a timing on this, but, you know, if we fast forward 24 months and we look back into, like, what caused the bear market, I think it's because, I think it will be because incentive programs run out, people lose excitement, and people realize that without incentives, like, what's the point of using DeFi, right? I mean, of course there's a point of using Defi, but, you know, the, the majority of the reason people use defi isn't because it's like a decentralized, decentralized way to, you know, do your finances. It's because there's a lot of, like, opportunities to make money, right.
00:28:39.754 - 00:28:58.592, Speaker A: But, you know, Q one near Aurora, like maybe that's the thing. Maybe Q two, arbitrage optimism in eth, right? Maybe like ethan ETH 2.0, the merge brings all the hype. Maybe arbitrum or optimism introduces the token. Who knows, right? I mean, who knows? Maybe they do their ownness in the program. That's going to be crazy if they do one. They mentioned that they're not going to do it, but who knows? Maybe they feel the pressure from the Eth max.
00:28:58.592 - 00:29:25.308, Speaker A: He's like, hey, pump our bags. Our bags are going down. Pump our bags, right? Maybe Q three is Algorand hit our hashgraph, right? Those two foundations announced incentive programs. Their defi ecosystem is not like not built out right now, but I'm sure, like at some point it's going to be good in Q four. Who knows? Maybe bitcoin takes over something, right? Or maybe gaming is so big that gaming has its own. But, you know, I don't really see what happens after, like Nier Aurora. Maybe eth, right? Like maybe Algorand.
00:29:25.308 - 00:29:52.850, Speaker A: Like, I don't really see what happens afterwards. Like, do we just keep rotating bags, like from one chain to the other chain, like a PvP system, right. Player versus player. Because I argue that in order for crypto to become like a, like, up only crazy super cycle market, there needs to be more capital inflow. And in the short term, what I've been seeing for the past few months is this capital rotation from one ecosystem to another, right? There's not that much new money coming into the space, right, in terms of, like, sheer volume.
00:29:53.270 - 00:29:53.646, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:53.678 - 00:30:05.382, Speaker A: So that's my thoughts on the defi bull market, right? And, yeah, I kind of talked about this already, right. Not saying tv goes to zero, right. I'm still going to use DeFi after incentive programs, but I'll probably be using it less.
00:30:05.486 - 00:30:05.822, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:05.886 - 00:30:22.286, Speaker A: Just saying. Activity will slow down, which we macro bearish most defi ecosystems and applications. Okay. Lots of bull hopium, lots of bare copium. Let's discuss a few other predictions I have because I'm sure this video is getting way too long. Oh, yeah. I think this is interesting.
00:30:22.286 - 00:30:44.336, Speaker A: So I feel like, I mean, I'm also prone to this, right. But I feel like a lot of people use the bitcoin dominance in e to BTC ratios as a way to, like, trade, right. And I'm sure some traders can use it at an advantage, right? And like, they can, like, make a lot of, make a lot of money doing so. However, I feel like most people that will purely look at bitcoin dominance and ETH BTC charts will underperform.
00:30:44.488 - 00:30:44.776, Speaker B: Right?
00:30:44.808 - 00:31:03.894, Speaker A: And ETH BTC, that was a thing in 2017 because, I mean, those were like the two biggest communities, right? And they're always like, fighting each other, like, oh, ETH is better. Bitcoin is better. You know, and also, like, bitcoin was like the, was like the base pair for trading crypto back in 2017. But at this point, right. Are we really comparing ETH and bitcoin as similar assets?
00:31:03.942 - 00:31:04.550, Speaker B: Right, sure.
00:31:04.590 - 00:31:52.222, Speaker A: They're both cryptos, but I don't think they're comparable assets. It's like, you know, going into the stock market and using like, the Tesla Walmart chart, right? It's like, oh, like the Tesla to Walmart ratio is at whatever, like 2.0. So this has historically been a good time to sell your Tesla to buy Walmart. Like, it doesn't, doesn't really make any sense. And I think over time, people will catch up to this. But, you know, I mean, if you can make money trading these things, then go for it, right? Who cares? I think crypto gaming, right? I think crypto gaming, with the whole, like, metaverse narrative and stuff, it's going to continue to be hyped up, and I think it's going to be continue to be overvalued. If you look at, like the top five games in crypto, it's going to be like, what? Defi Kingdoms, Axie, Sandbox, Decentraland, alluvium, right? Axie and Defi Kingdoms has users.
00:31:52.222 - 00:32:12.422, Speaker A: Illuvium, sandbox, decentraland. They don't have users, right? But I think they're like top 50 or something. It's pretty crazy if these projects can command these valuations with essentially zero users. I think that at some point, the gaming sector is going to enter a huge bubble right, where it's going to be based on hype. It's going to be based on vc investment. Oh, like SoftBank's getting into this. Oh, like that firm is getting into this.
00:32:12.422 - 00:32:34.690, Speaker A: And it's going to be like, oh, yeah, it's going to be like this token is going to be crazy hyped up, but it's gonna be some purely hype and speculation, right? It's really, really hard to value these things. You can argue that you can kind of value axie or Defi kingdoms because, you know, like they're actually users and people actually play that game. But, you know, I think gaming projects will continue to be overvalued. Like, I own a bunch of jewel, right? That's been my baby.
00:32:34.730 - 00:32:35.026, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:35.098 - 00:32:42.410, Speaker A: But you can easily make an argument why Juul is overvalued, right? But it doesn't matter because other games are way more overvalued.
00:32:42.450 - 00:32:42.854, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:42.962 - 00:33:47.794, Speaker A: Like if, if like Decentraland is overvalued, I like a scale of one to ten at like a nine, maybe Defi Kingdoms is at like a four, right? So Defi kingdoms can continue to be overvalued because the entire sector is going to continue, continue to be a bubble until it deflates at some point. Lastly, I'm embarrassed. Ows. And I mean, I know, like, people love daos, right? It's like the idea of a decentralized, autonomous organization. But to be honest, as a person that likes money, I'd rather bet on an amazing founder and bet on him to execute, right, as an operator and as a leader, then to bet on like thousands of token holders who only cares about like, number going up, right, and like, pump our bags, right? Like, you know, because I feel like at this point, daos, right? Like, if we're like really like focused on like a governance token system, it's gonna be like, oh, yeah. Like people are only gonna vote for things that's gonna make their tokens go up, right, in the short term. And sure, like maybe some community members care about the long term, but, you know, it's kind of how it is, right? Pure governance tokens bearish, you know, governance tokens that accrue some value, right, in terms.
00:33:47.794 - 00:34:10.468, Speaker A: In forms of like, staking and whatnot, maybe, right? But pure governance tokens, I just, I just don't like them, right. I just think they're going to continue to underperform. It's going to be a way for the members and the investors and the team to just like, you know, slowly take profits, right? Okay. That being said, summary short term bullish farmers and open minded traders and their ability to make a lot of money.
00:34:10.524 - 00:34:10.956, Speaker B: Right.
00:34:11.068 - 00:34:44.526, Speaker A: Short term and long term bullish, defi, medium term, meh, need better innovation. Maybe it comes, maybe in the next six months, a bunch of innovation comes, and it allows, it creates, like, the infrastructure for more people to onboard. But you know what I'm most worried about when it comes to DeFi is what happens when the incentives run out. Okay. And what happens when the hype for the incentives run out, right. I think user activity will slow, and I think, you know, that's, that might be like, a slow grind down for ETh. Sorry, not eth, but, like, you know, just like DeFi TvL over time.
00:34:44.558 - 00:34:44.966, Speaker B: Right?
00:34:45.078 - 00:34:55.630, Speaker A: And maybe, you know, Defi TvL keeps going up because, like, people, like, bridge stable coins, right? And people farm in stable coins. But, you know, that's not really, like, the best way to measure, like, you know, how great an ecosystem is thriving.
00:34:55.670 - 00:34:55.822, Speaker B: Right?
00:34:55.846 - 00:35:03.406, Speaker A: Like, you need more applications, you need more volatile, I guess, like, innovative innovators coming into the space and, you know, like, I don't really see that right now.
00:35:03.438 - 00:35:03.582, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:03.606 - 00:35:27.516, Speaker A: There's, there's, like, fewer innovators. But other than that, like, I don't really see too much things happening, and maybe I'm just ignorant to, like, what's happening in the back end. And I'm sure I'm ignorant, right? Because, like, we don't, like, we're ignorant to the things we don't see. And I'm sure a bunch of geniuses are working on, like, a bunch of great things. But in the, from what I see right now, I think the bear market will happen for defi when the hype and the incentives run out. Bullish. Near.
00:35:27.516 - 00:35:36.812, Speaker A: I also think near. Sorry. I also think other l ones with users with cheap, cheap fees will do extremely well. Right? Like Solana, Luna, avax. Right. I think they'll do okay.
00:35:36.836 - 00:35:36.972, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:36.996 - 00:35:54.780, Speaker A: I think they pumped a lot. Right. I think 2021 was the year for those assets, so maybe they'll underperform relative to the other ones. Maybe this year is gonna be, like, near phantom Adam, stuff like that, right. Harmony, stuff like that. You know, there's, like, it's really hard to know. I'm betting on near just because I can actually see catalysts coming.
00:35:54.780 - 00:36:13.336, Speaker A: Right. And it's easier to bet on catalysts than to bet on the ecosystem because it's cheap and hoping that people buy into it. Lastly, never marry a coin. 99% of crypto tokens are inflationary. We often talk about bitcoin being the hardest money. But even bitcoin is inflationary, right? There's more. There's like new bitcoin being mined every single day.
00:36:13.336 - 00:36:34.840, Speaker A: Don't marry a coin. Don't marry a particular ecosystem. If you want to be a community member, right, and contribute, then yeah, go for it, right? But if you want to be a profit, maxi, it doesn't pay to just stick to one ecosystem. Coins can go down and market can go up. So I also talk about quick swap back my polygon days. So this is a chart of quick swap, right. It's a farm token, right.
00:36:34.840 - 00:36:49.546, Speaker A: It just goes down. But I mean, this is the price. If you look at the market cap looks like this, right? So even when price is down like 50%, right, from May to like August, right, when August, like price was like $750, the market cap was much higher.
00:36:49.618 - 00:36:49.946, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:50.018 - 00:37:24.786, Speaker A: Just because it's super inflationary, right. Always keep this in mind. Almost everything in crypto is inflationary. And it's going to be really hard for you to succeed in crypto if all you're doing is like betting on one project and like, you know, betting on like an inflationary project and just like bag holding it, you know, because price is a factor of supply and demand and if supply keeps going up, there needs to be more demand to capture, like, you know, to, I guess, what is it to absorb the supply increase. Always keep that in mind. Okay, so that's the end of the video. Hope everyone liked it.
00:37:24.786 - 00:37:37.106, Speaker A: Yeah. So I will be making an announcement. So I do have a private discord, right. I don't run ads and stuff, but I do have a private discord. I will be raising the price for the private discord on Sunday.
00:37:37.258 - 00:37:37.618, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:37.674 - 00:37:49.850, Speaker A: So how it's gonna go? I think it's gonna be, I'll be raising like $100 per month if you. So for exit. Exit, sorry. For existing subscribers, the price is not going to change.
00:37:49.890 - 00:37:50.066, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:50.098 - 00:38:15.516, Speaker A: So if you pay, if you're at the $70 level, right. As long as you subscribed, it's not going to go up. Okay. And for anyone that subscribes in like the next like five days, you know, you get to lock in that lower rate. But starting Sunday, right? Or I guess Monday, because you know, you get to sign up until Sunday. Starting Monday, prices can go up to $100 a month. And yeah, if you unsubscribe and then resubscribe, you're gonna have to pay the higher rate.
00:38:15.516 - 00:38:20.116, Speaker A: Okay. So, you know, the growth on my discord has been incredible.
00:38:20.188 - 00:38:20.396, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:20.428 - 00:38:24.460, Speaker A: We have over a thousand members, you know, and I think I add a lot of value.
00:38:24.500 - 00:38:24.676, Speaker B: Right?
00:38:24.708 - 00:38:44.020, Speaker A: I make two videos a week. They awfully. They often range from 40 to 60 minutes. I post every day I'm active. And there's a lot of giga brains in the discord to learn from. So, you know, just making an announcement. I don't really talk about the discord recently, but, you know, just announcing this just for the sake of it.
00:38:44.020 - 00:38:45.860, Speaker A: So thank you guys for watching and have fun farming out there.
