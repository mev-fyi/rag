00:00:00.720 - 00:00:24.166, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Humble farmer Taiki here, and welcome to this week's edition of Farms of the Week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. And check out the premium discord link will be in the description below. So the long awaited Stark net token airdrop just happened. And, you know, Starknet is a thriving ecosystem where they raised $225 million, as you can see here. And the TVL is only a third of that. But you know, I mean, look at the, you know, I mean, look at this trajectory.
00:00:24.166 - 00:00:56.940, Speaker A: It's going up. So, you know, it's a thriving ecosystem and there's a lot of people upset with the airdrop allocation. So for full transparency, I didn't get the airdrop, unfortunately, even though I did use Starknet, you know, in like last year and whatnot. But like that's fine. And if you like, actually look at this allocation, it's not bad. So half of it, so 7% of the supply went to the community. And so like half of that is going to users and then the other half is going to a combination of eat stakers like solo stakers, and also, you know, developers and whatnot, which I think is pretty reasonable.
00:00:56.940 - 00:02:05.808, Speaker A: So I have no problems with this distribution. What I think I do have a problem on is the vesting schedules and the predatory nature of how VC's insiders and I guess ETH influencers, they just get all these allocations and then they say, dump tokens on us. And I guess going back on this, if you look at the estimated supply of stark in circulation, it looks like this, right? Where, I mean, like, what is this? Right? It looks like Starknet hired SBF as a consultant for Stark Tokenomics. And if you look under the hood, what's going on here is, if you think about it, most tokens, whenever they launch, there's a one year cliff for team members and investors, and then there's like a three year vesting schedule. So teams have to wait a year, essentially to get their tokens. And this time around, Stark said, you know what, we technically, technically, we launched our token ten months ago, right? It's not tradable, but we technically launched it. So technically, two months from now, it's one year from TGE.
00:02:05.808 - 00:02:40.962, Speaker A: So technically we should start to get our tokens. And, you know, and the circling supply of stark is going to triple in two months, even though they really haven't shipped anything. I mean, they shipped an l two, you know, and, you know, like, it is what it is. And a lot of people overset because, yeah, it's another case of teams just, you know, getting their exit liquidity without really having to like drop anything. And I'm not saying anything critical of the team. I'm sure they're working really, really hard. And I'm not one to criticize because I'm literally a dude on the Internet wearing a farmer hat and a rake.
00:02:40.962 - 00:03:05.226, Speaker A: Um, but you know, like, like what is this? Right? To align long term incentives of investors and early contributors with the interests of the stock in the community and following common practice in decentralized ecosystems. Common practice. Um, we're going to triple the circulating supply in two months. Uh, so definitely not bullish, this token. Definitely not bullish. Uh, I'm sure it's tradable. I'm sure you can buy the launch and maybe sell like 50% higher or something.
00:03:05.226 - 00:03:35.610, Speaker A: Uh, which I will definitely not do. But really, you know, like really. And I think this is kind of adding to, you know, this VC hate, right? This VC hate insider tokens, insider team they're dumping on us. But you know, let's kind of empathize with them, right? Let's try to take the other side. So let me, let me become serious for a little bit. Cutest out of music cue to Saddam music. So let me, let me put down my rake let me put down my hat and let me adjust my hair so, you know, this is serious techie.
00:03:35.610 - 00:04:09.352, Speaker A: Let me even increase my face here. This is unprecedented video production here. So, you know, a lot of people hate on the VC's, a lot of people hate on the teams. But without the VC's, without the teams there will be no crypto. I mean there will be like no defi or on chain ecosystem because someone has to fund them. And there's only a few select humans on earth that willing to just create something out of nothing that doesn't accept any VC funding. And that's, you know, it's hard to expect crypto to just have a thriving ecosystem without teams and VC's.
00:04:09.352 - 00:04:44.974, Speaker A: And sure, you know, VC's, I mean, I guess like a way to think about it is, you know, VC's, they're, they're people too, right? They have feelings too, you know, you know, they have feelings, you know, they have families to feed and sure, you know, the VC's, they sunk $225 million into a non existent ecosystem. Sure, Dydx left Starknet to create their own cosmos app chain. Sure, no one uses starknet. And sure, you know, like anyone that downloaded the Argent wallet knows how bad the user experience is. But no team members they're humans too. They have feelings. They have families to feed.
00:04:44.974 - 00:05:31.960, Speaker A: They want to go out at a bar on a Thursday night and say, you know what? This rounds on me, right? You know, they want to flex, you know, to their friends VC's. You know, they, they have jobs. Everyone has jobs. You know, they want to clip their 2%, like management fees and, you know, they want to be able to recoup some of their investments and they don't want to have to explain to their lp's that, yeah, like, you know, we fucked up. So, you know, like, they convened with one another and said, you know what? Let's pay some influencers. Let's show this token, and let's triple the circuiting supply in two months so that, you know, we can hedge our token on perps so that whenever tokens start to start to vest, you know, like, we're already getting our exit liquidity. And what even is the.
00:05:31.960 - 00:05:50.062, Speaker A: Let me check the, let me check the stark token valuation here. Okay, so let me, let me make my face smaller here. Okay, so I logged into Evo. Let's go to start. Okay. 173. So an implied evaluation of $17 billion.
00:05:50.062 - 00:06:18.020, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you know, like VC's, they're. No, they're human too, right? Not like they just want to launch the token at $17 billion evaluation, hedge the token via perps. You know, everyone knows they're overvalued currently. Currently right at the current where their product is. But, you know, let's try to empathize with them. Let's try to empathize with these VC's. Let's try to empathize with their, you know, their predatory token tokenomic structures.
00:06:18.020 - 00:06:36.820, Speaker A: They just want to dump, right? I mean, they want to dump on it. They want to dump on retail. It is what it is. They get to decide the rules. It's their project. So who are we to signs, right? So that being said, we can turn off the sad music now. Let's go back to unserious taiki with the farmer hat, humble farmer taiki here.
00:06:36.820 - 00:07:22.000, Speaker A: And, you know, I mean, at least they dropped the token, right? I mean, I guess they had to drop a token to generate exit liquidity, but yeah, I mean, you know, this is the meta, right? Just. Okay. And anyways, hopefully you could catch my sarcasm there, but I do, I do want to pivot the conversation to more serious topics. And I do want to give my thoughts on the airdrops because although I do want to empathize with the VC's, there's been a lot of anti airdrop sentiment. Sorry, anti airdrop farming sentiment amongst VC's. It seems like a lot of VC's are just upset that, you know, retail is making money on airdrops and they think that this is too frothy or too crazy. But I will take the other side on that as well.
00:07:22.000 - 00:08:28.776, Speaker A: Because if you're betting against airdrops, I mean, first of all, I see no reason for the airdrop meta to not continue because I mean, I'm not like a legal expert, but I'm sure that airdropping tokens is like a better way or it has better legal repercussions than just giving tokens to the team market makers and just dumping it and making retail buy into open market. So I'm sure there are legal, for sure there are legal implications. But even if that's not true, most projects, I mean, think about all the tokens that's launched and like most of them, if not all, are just airdropped. And betting against airdrop farming is kind of like betting that teams in the coming weeks, months and years to not drop tokens in the coming. Yeah, in the coming bull market. So, like, why, like, why are people saying that the airdrop farming is going to die or it's going to be diluted? Sure it is being diluted, right? I think one rule of thumb is that on average, I think EVM airdrops are going to be more diluted than non EVM airdrops. Why is that? Well, everyone has a metamask wallet.
00:08:28.776 - 00:08:59.680, Speaker A: Everyone has money on EVM chains. Why? Because most of the wealth on chain lies on Ethereum, Mainnet and L two s. That's normal. So if there's a new airdrop farming opportunity on an EVM chain, what's the barrier to entry? Very, very low, right? You just take eth or you bridge and then you just do stuff and then bam, you get points or something. So on average, I think EVM airdrops are going to be super diluted. On the other hand, I think non EVM airdrop farms are going to be less diluted. Why? Because there's more barriers to entry.
00:08:59.680 - 00:09:35.210, Speaker A: To enter the Solana ecosystem, you have to download the phantom wallet. To airdrop farm Celestia or dimension, you have to download the Kepler or leap wallet. That creates more barriers, that creates more friction, and therefore more people are less likely to go through the efforts to actually take those steps. There are exceptions, right? I'm not saying that you should not farm anything in EVM. Technically, the manta airdrop was pretty good if you think about it, use bridge eth and you get tokens. Blast probably will be decent, but it might be worthwhile going into other ecosystems. Eigen layer, I think will be such.
00:09:35.210 - 00:10:21.616, Speaker A: I think Eigen layer is going to launch at such a high valuation that yes, it's diluted, it's like 6 billion TVL or something, but I think the token is going to be worth so much that I think it's still worth farming Eigen layer restaking either across directly with the Eigen layer or just via liquid restaking protocols. So there are exceptions, but on average, I think farming non EVM is definitely like where the edges, and that's primarily where I focused my attention on, which is mostly sauna, celestia and dimension. So let's talk about, I guess, the modular ecosystem first. Celsia. So Milky Way, which is a liquid staking derivative provider just introduced points today and they're allocating 10% of the supply. The milk token. And look, milk token.
00:10:21.616 - 00:10:49.938, Speaker A: Like that's so bullish. The ticker is so bullish. And the liquid staking derivative is called milk tea. So bullish. I used to work at a milk tea shop like a boba company, like while I was a student and after college, like, you know, like headquarters and whatnot. And I love milk tea, so I'm naturally drawn to like milk tea, right? Temp summer supply, reasonable. And you know, you can go to the Milky Way application, you can stake here for milk tia, and they get points.
00:10:49.938 - 00:11:17.988, Speaker A: I believe if you go here, click the point how it works. One. Actually, let's go back to the thread. One milk tia gets you one milk point, right? You can milk those points once a day. So if you hold ten milk tia and you hold it for ten days, you'll get 100 points. And surely at some point these points will be renewable for tokens. And they're going to drop a token in the first half of this year.
00:11:17.988 - 00:11:49.420, Speaker A: And if you look at the Jito airdrop, I mean, that was huge. Literally. Like my analysts, not me, right, my analysts, right? Like the HPA research analysts, they got like 100k worth of tokens by staking like $100 worth of jido soul across like five wallets, which is actually insane. I don't think this thing is going to be worth that much. Why? Because more people are aware that, oh, the Jito airdrop was worth a lot more than I expected. Let's farm milk Tia. So naturally it's going to be more diluted.
00:11:49.420 - 00:12:17.604, Speaker A: I forgot when they launched, but back in December, I staked my Tia with them, and fortunately for me, the point system is retroactive. So some wallets that I have like two Tia staked. Sorry, two milk Tia staked. I have like 100 points, even though, you know, I barely put that much capital into it. So hopefully it's gonna be worth a lot. You know, I think there's kind of this trend around. Obviously, Tia is like trading at $19 billion FDB or something.
00:12:17.604 - 00:12:50.902, Speaker A: It's worth a lot. And, you know, whoever can become the number one liquid staking derivative provider can command a pretty high valuation. Just look at Lido, right? Even stride, they're allocating 5% of the supply to people that hold the steak Tia. I also think this is a pretty good airdrop farm. The Alt layer airdrop rewarded people that staked milk Tia and staked Tia as well. So if the meta becomes that, you can hold at least ease, right, liquid staking derivatives of Tia and still receive airdrops, I mean, there's no reason for you to not do it. And 5% of the supply, I mean, that's, that's a lot.
00:12:50.902 - 00:13:14.600, Speaker A: I mean, stride, it's been up only still at half a billion dollars. I still think it's pretty attractive valuation wise. Of course, it's kind of hard to buy into this. We did write a research report on it on stride back in September. Was like, what, like 70? Okay. You know, I mean, God damn it, you know, I missed out on the ten x or nine x. Essentially.
00:13:14.600 - 00:13:51.440, Speaker A: My mindset at the time was that, you know what? Like, I could buy stride, but I could, you know, stake my t out with Milky Way, and I'll get this airdrop, so I don't need to expose myself too much to LSD tokens. Obviously, the correct decision was to do both. Just stake tio with Milky Way, stake TL with stride, and buy the stride token. But half a billion seems pretty reasonable to me, actually. But I'm a boomer, I'm a mid curve. So I'm just staking a bunch of milk to you across numerous wallets, and hopefully these points will be worth something. So there's that.
00:13:51.440 - 00:14:43.336, Speaker A: So, pivoting to dimension, dimension, the token, I mean, it's trading at, okay, like, this is pretty ridiculous, like $8.30. So I've been talking about dimension since last year, December, and I've let it be known that I'm pretty bullish this project. If you think about it, if you think of the module ecosystem eth, right, eth can do data availability, settlement, and execution all in one chain, but no one wants to do that because there's like twelve transactions per second and it costs like $50 to, you know, do a swap on Mainet. So the eat scaling roadmap says let's use eigen layer for data availability, let's use Eat for settlement, and then let's use l two is for execution. So that, that's the eat scaling roadmap. And then Celestia says, okay, like celestial will also focus on data availability. Dimension can focus on settlement, and then we can have app chains that focus on execution, execution on top.
00:14:43.336 - 00:15:27.370, Speaker A: So the idea is, okay, like, you know, Celestia and dimension are some, somewhat of a competitor to the ETh scaling roadmap. Not really, because I mean, you know, I mean they just launched, but that's kind of the narrative. And then if you go to dimension, and I think if you go to the testnet, I'm not sure if you, I'm not sure we can check. But you know, there were like 10,000 roll apps on testnet. Yeah, they were like, yeah, okay, you can go here. If you go to the testnet, there were like 14,000 overlaps. If one of them, right, if one of them just doesn't air 50, okay, if one of them doesn't airdrop to dimension stakers and it's worth like a decent amount, then that can even, you know, kickstart somewhat of a narrative.
00:15:27.370 - 00:15:53.624, Speaker A: I have low expectations, to be honest. You know, if you think about staking Tia, right, Tia launched in November, and the first airdrop that hit people's wallets happened for that mention in February. So now, is it reasonable to expect people to stake dimension and receive an airdrop immediately? I don't think so. But I am bullish. And for that reason, you know, I do have a validator. HFA Times defy dojo. We're number 34.
00:15:53.624 - 00:16:31.428, Speaker A: So thank you for everyone's support. I think. I mean, what I'm personally doing is I'm sticking with myself. I'm also staking with other validators like Stixedo, igloo company, Lavender five embryo. I mean, you know, like, to be honest, if a validator is in the top, like let's say 69, I think, you know, I mean, you should do your own research. But I think they're like, you know, just good bets because I mean, they're all like fungible, right? They're all basically, I mean, all validators are essentially commodities. Maybe that's like a hot take, but you know, I mean, just being honest, right? You know, just stake Tia, receive air drops, steak dime receive air drops.
00:16:31.428 - 00:17:09.780, Speaker A: I've talked about how Tia is the next three three, right, the 33 of the cycle, because everyone's taking, and then if everyone stakes Tia, they receive dime and everyone sticks dime, then maybe Tia and dime is like three three and nine nine, right. If you think about like, the ohm reference with like, you know, leverage and whatnot, um, always do your own research. Um, I think they're good. I mean, if you got the a drop, I think staking some of it and maybe selling some of it, I mean, could make sense. To be honest, I haven't sold a single thing because hash diamond hands and I am bullish. And I think, you know, Tia and dime are potential, like, bull market outperformers because of, like, the pure pumpamentals it provides. Does that mean it's a good buy right now? I have no idea.
00:17:09.780 - 00:17:31.596, Speaker A: Okay. But, you know, like, all I can say is that I'm bullish. I mean, I'm backing it with my actions here. I haven't sold. And I also launched a validator, and staking it across multiple validators could be worth it. And like, you know, spreading it across different wallets. If you want to know what I'm doing with, like, my ultimate dime staking operation, make sure to check out the premium discord link will be in the description below.
00:17:31.596 - 00:17:54.476, Speaker A: You can check out what I'm doing personally with my wallets. And, I mean, this makes, it sounds like, super fancy, but, you know, it's kind of alluding to, like, the ultimate Tia airdrop farming operation that I laid out in mid December, 2 months ago in the premium discord as well. And I got like a six figure airdrop for dying. So it worked. It worked. We'll see if it works. Again, no expectations, but just letting you know.
00:17:54.476 - 00:18:24.982, Speaker A: So. So let's jump into the monolithic ecosystem, which is Solana. So this year, you know, I think last year I was. I think what generally happens is that in a bear market, people kind of just rotate back into ether for the relative safety and the comfort and because people don't know which alto ones are going to recover. And then as we enter a bull market, people are slowly coming to the, you know, coming to terms that, yeah, like, maybe either alone I should diversify away from ether. Maybe I should have some monolithic exposure. Whoops.
00:18:24.982 - 00:19:00.876, Speaker A: And I should have some modular exposure. So, you know, monolithic is Hana, and the modular is like celestia that I mentioned and other eigen layer and like, other DA providers and other execution settlement. I mean, I'm sure there's gonna be a bunch of tokens, but that's kind of, I think, the mindset that people are starting to have. And like I mentioned, I don't really see a reason for the airdrop meta to end. And I think the Solana ecosystem is one of the best places to airdrop farm. Me personally, I'm a mid curve, right? I'm a mid curve. I don't really want to buy Sol just like, you know, just slam it here, right, at like $118 or $15, because I faded it on the entire move up.
00:19:00.876 - 00:19:25.304, Speaker A: But I did allocate a sizable amount of my portfolio in the GLP. And GLP is similar to GLP. It's roughly 44% stable coins and, like, 56% risk assets. And it makes money from all the fees, all the swaps that route through the pool. And whenever people trade in and out of purpose on Jupiter, they pay a ten basis point. So 0.1% open fee and the 0.1%
00:19:25.304 - 00:19:53.370, Speaker A: closing fee. The fee structure is so predatory that if you're trading on this, you're most likely going to lose money. But people still trade because they're djns. And then if you're in JLP over time, you know, I mean, you know, just look at this price chart. JLP, all the fees are auto compounded back into the pool, and it's literally up only. So I think I'm viewing GLP as like a, I mean, you know, smart contract risk and whatnot. But, you know, it's, it's kind of like a savings account.
00:19:53.370 - 00:20:29.498, Speaker A: Back in, like a year and a half ago, like, basically, like, after, like, FTX imploded, I made a video saying that I viewed tricrypto on curve and GLP on GMX as my crypto savings accounts. And, you know, fast forward it to now. Those yields are not that great, but they're still good products. And I still think that these LP tokens kind of act like pretty good savings accounts. Crypto savings accounts. If you think about it, if you already have money in crypto, you know, I mean, you're already taking on a significant amount of risk. So, you know, if you want to think about a savings account, then maybe something like this, that pays 140% apy, that still gives you downside of volatility.
00:20:29.498 - 00:20:52.570, Speaker A: Sorry, downside. That mitigates downside, but still gives you upside. Whenever the crypto markets go up like this, I think it's worth considering. And who knows? If, you know, if you're providing liquidity, then technically, you know, you are helping the protocol. So maybe you'll. Or I'll receive a Jupiter airdrop for season two. Another thing I think is worth farming is drift.
00:20:52.570 - 00:21:23.942, Speaker A: I do like drift. I've met with the team a couple times. I like them all. I think the team is pretty strong. They raised $23 million, which is pretty impressive for an application. If you deposit money into these turbocharger or supercharger vaults, you're basically giving money to the team. Because, you know, if you click on deposit here, it takes you to this, and you're basically giving money to this market maker, which is basically the drift team that puts in volume.
00:21:23.942 - 00:21:59.012, Speaker A: That's like doing market making strategies that has like a apy of like 42%. So, I mean, on its own, it's a good stablecoin farm, but also if you get drift points, I think it could be worth it. If you deposit money here, it doesn't show any points. However, if you click on the point section, I believe the number two and number three drift tours. Right. These points are the market making vaults. So I think, you know, whenever the points do get distributed, or like, the tokens get distributed, it's going to go like pro rata to whoever has money deposited into these vaults.
00:21:59.012 - 00:22:18.788, Speaker A: So I still think it's a pretty good farm. It was confirmed. Right? So, David, right. Part of the drift team, I asked them, are circuit vaults getting points still show zero for me. It won't show on the page, but they are accumulating for lending and borrowing. It does not get points. So you do have to put in volume to get these points.
00:22:18.788 - 00:22:43.326, Speaker A: But, you know, if you deposit into these vaults, the market making vaults are putting in volume on behalf of your money. So that's kind of the way to view it. So, you know, markets just pumping. It's pretty crazy. I mean, it's. Yeah, I remember a year ago, I mean, it was pretty. Pretty nuts.
00:22:43.326 - 00:23:05.776, Speaker A: Right. I guess I can even. Yeah, let's actually go to my studio here. I remember a year ago, I was just making videos. No one was watching it. You go to my analytics? No, let's go to the subscribers here. I was losing subscribers every single day.
00:23:05.776 - 00:23:41.730, Speaker A: And then starting in October or November, I started to gain subscribers. And I guess if you overlay the social metrics on the Solana chart, in November, it was dollar 40, and now it's three x from there. I guess it is important to keep track of retail. And I guess if you're a full time in crypto, it might feel like things are frothy just because people are getting crazy air drops. People are making money on meme coins, and tokens are pumping. But if you look at. I guess if you look at the Defi youtubers, I guess like the on chain youtubers looks like this.
00:23:41.730 - 00:24:07.206, Speaker A: So in 2021, we had two peaks. One time in Q two, and then second time in Q four, Q three, Q four, and then, I mean, during the bear market, it was, like, awful. And yes, I mean, we are seeing more fraud, but this is nothing compared to what we saw last cycle. So I think it's also worthwhile to just consider bull market narratives. Shedding yourself from bear market PTSD. Yes, retail is back. Yes, people are watching videos.
00:24:07.206 - 00:24:48.446, Speaker A: Yes, people are coming back. It does feel frothy. But if you just compare the froth to what we saw last cycle, and if you expect this cycle to be bigger than last cycle, which I think is a reasonable expectation, then I don't really see reasons to be bearish, to be honest, especially when the stock market is just chatting at all time highs. I mean, people's been worrying about a recession, but it just keeps going higher. And in this environment, I feel like it's supportive of risk assets, and at some point, the money has to trickle down to crypto and what types of projects will do well. Of course the majors will do well. Maybe the alt out ones that survived and their metrics are improving, they're gonna do well.
00:24:48.446 - 00:25:28.006, Speaker A: AI coins might do well. Defi projects making money might do well. And I think it's worthwhile considering, just, like, turning your gear to a bull market. And even if you're afraid of, like, let's say, potential downside, maybe, right? Maybe instead of, like, holding a bunch of cash, maybe just allocate money to things like GLP liquidity pools, half USDC or half stable coins, half risk assets. Because the fees are auto combined, it goes up. Only I don't think it's that bad of a strategy. Yes, it's gonna underperform to the upside, but it'll also outperform to the downside and to the side and choppy markets because people are gonna get liquidated and whatnot.
00:25:28.006 - 00:25:50.704, Speaker A: So just things to consider. That's gonna be it for me, I guess. Key takeaways. I guess if you want to airdrop Farm, maybe spend more time on non EVM chains.
