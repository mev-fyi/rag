00:00:00.320 - 00:00:19.542, Speaker A: What's up, guys? Tyke here. And in this video I'll be going over Bancor vortex, the liquidity black hole. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Let's get started. So this is a goal of channel. I don't just make meme videos. I also look at the fundamentals behind each project to determine whether whether or not I want to invest in it.
00:00:19.542 - 00:00:46.666, Speaker A: As always, none of this is financial advice, just my opinion. And for full disclosure, I actually do own b and t tokens. I actually bought this dip. All right, so this is overview of the video. I structured it in this way so, you know, someone dumb like me can understand it. So if I can understand it, then you definitely can if you watch till the end of the video. So what is Vancouver vortex? It basically allows you to stake your b and t into Bancor and get vvnt back.
00:00:46.666 - 00:01:26.446, Speaker A: And that token can be used to swap with any other token or whatever you do with it. And if you want to get your b and t back that you originally put in, you have to basically pay back the equivalent amount of v, b and t. So I'm going to go over the how and what you can actually do with Vancouver vortex, because the ladder is what actually matters and what's important. So this is how it works. Let's go over each step one by one. So I buy bnt in the market and I put it into a liquidity pool, right? And the bank order I put into the liquidity pool is going to remain in the contract and earn trading fees and any other liquidity mining rewards that Bancorp might offer. So it's going to grow in value.
00:01:26.446 - 00:02:02.628, Speaker A: And, you know, by depositing Bancor Bnt, I'm going to get vvnt back. And that vvnt can be used to swap with any other token. So let's say I bullish bitcoin and I buy wrapped bitcoin with vvnt or with USDC and let's say bitcoin moons, right? Like it, like triples. And I'm happy. And at this point, I want to get my bnt back. I can swap the wrapped bitcoin to vbnt and to the equivalent amount that I put the bnt, the original Bnt, and get back my b and T, plus any other rewards that I got in. Alright, so if this was confusing, don't worry.
00:02:02.628 - 00:02:41.650, Speaker A: I'm going to go over practical examples of what, like you and I can actually do with Bancorp vortex and go over some risks. So I'll go over a few examples, and for the sake of simplicity, I'm going to assume that the price of Vbnt is the same as b and till. And I'm depositing $10,000 worth of b and t to get $10,000 worth of b and t back. All right, so let's say, you know, in the first example, I'm bullish eth, right? I think it's gonna moon, I think it's gonna go up, and I wanna buy. I wanna buy eth without selling any of my tokens. I wanna buy eth without selling my b and t. So I'm gonna swap 1000 vnt for ten eth, assuming that the price of eth is $1,000.
00:02:41.650 - 00:03:25.844, Speaker A: And, you know, let's go. Let's say there are two scenarios, right? Scenario one is when eth doubles in price and bv and t stays constant. And scenario two is when vvt doubles in price and eth stays constant. So in the first example, when eth doubles, I can essentially swap five eth for 1000 vb and t, and I can use that to get my 1000 b and d back my original stake, and I basically, essentially profit five eth from this transaction, or $10,000. Pretty cool, right? I bought eth without selling my b and t, and I was rewarded with $10,000. But what if b and t doubles and eth? The price of eth remains the constant. Now, I'm going to need 20 eth to get my 1000 vvnt back.
00:03:25.844 - 00:04:11.412, Speaker A: And, you know, then I can swap it back from my original b and t that I originally staked, and I lost ten eth, which is $10,000. So these are the two scenarios, obviously. Like, the price of coins are going to fluctuate relatively to each other, but this is, like, a practical example of what might happen. So if you're buying eth with BnT, it only makes sense if you think eth will outperform B and T, right? And if you think about it, if you own vbnt, you're inherently bullish B and T because you bought B and T in the market and you're staking it on Bancor. So you're bullish B and T. So you have to ask yourself, like, would I want to do this? If you're an experienced trader, it might make sense. But for me, like, you know, like a retail normie, I might not want to do this because I'm bullish B and T and B.
00:04:11.412 - 00:04:54.930, Speaker A: If B and T goes up more, then I just lose money. So how I might use Vancouver Vortex is a little simple trick that I thought about where I can basically swap vvnt for USDC, right? Because, you know, maybe, let's say, you know, bancor, it drops 50% value. This were to happen, and I used vvnt to swap it for USDC. Now I can take my 5000 USDC for 1000 Vb and T, get that back and profit $5,000. It's essentially like shorting the market in this scenario. It's. Yeah, so it's like a great way to short the price of B and T without having to worry about, like paying funding, etcetera.
00:04:54.930 - 00:05:26.234, Speaker A: It's one way to do it. And if, let's say, I'm bearish, bitcoin or ethereum, you can use vvnt to buy USDC without selling any of my coins and effectively shortening the market. Because rest assured, if bitcoin or eth tanks Bancor Bnt is gonna dump a lot harder. Okay, so the third example of what you can do with VBNT is to just put it in the liquidity pool for VBnt B and T. So this is the lowest risk. But, you know, demand for this is uber high. It's most likely being front run by bots right now.
00:05:26.234 - 00:05:59.312, Speaker A: So, you know, I'm definitely not gonna be able to do this. But, you know, this is the safest way to do it. But right now, there's not that much space for any of us to put in. And obviously the APR is super high right now. This is bound to go down as liquidity goes up. But no, this will be a great way to just stake B and T and just put vvt into this pool and just earn lots of, earn trading fees from Bancorp. So in the previous few examples, I just assumed that the price of B and T, V and VT is the same.
00:05:59.312 - 00:06:48.854, Speaker A: So what if it fluctuates? What is the stability mechanism? And that's a good question. So Vancouver has this really cool mechanism where. So there are two scenarios, right? Like whether VBNt is below or above the price of bancor. So if VBNt is below the price of VNT, the protocol will take the trading fees earned by the protocol and just buy the VNT in the market and burn the token. So it'll just basically reduce the supply of VBNT until the price reaches peg. That's pretty simple. But what if the other way around, what if the price of VVMT is higher? Then the market force then the protocol is reliant on market forces, so arbitrageurs can buy VNT on the market, stake it for VVNT, and arbitrage the difference away for profit until it reaches peg.
00:06:48.854 - 00:07:17.224, Speaker A: This might be confusing, so here's an example to make sure that, you know, it sticks to your head. So let's say VVNt is $11, VNt is $10. You know, I'm an arbitrager. I'm happy. I'm going to stake 100 B and T for 100 volts bnt, and I can swap 100 VB and T for 110 B and T, right? And that's an instant ten B and T profit. Obviously, there's, like, many bots that are just arbitraging this away. So it's unlikely that you and I can have a chance to just manually do this.
00:07:17.224 - 00:08:13.206, Speaker A: But, you know, it basically just shows to you, shows you, like, the stability mechanism that VVNT has. So, in summary, VVNt bancor Vortex adds utility for staking VNT on top of rewards you might receive, which is really cool, because you can basically use this to leverage trade, whether it be to the long side or to the short side. VNT pool is a safest way to earn additional rewards, but there's no space for it right now. And the cool thing about Vancouver vortex is that it basically sucks in b and t into the protocol and increases liquidity. For the amm, I call this the liquidity black hole, because if you want to use VvNT, you have to buy b and t and lock it into Bancor. And that bancor, that b and t that's locked in Bancor might be stuck there forever. And this is really cool, because I went over this in my previous video, the fundamental analysis on Bancor.
00:08:13.206 - 00:08:40.310, Speaker A: But with amms, there are two big problems. There's the liquidity problem and the impermanence loss problem. The impermanence loss problem I went over into detail in this video. So I suggest everyone to check this video out if anyone's interested. But the liquidity problem is really, really important, because with automated market makers like Uniswap, you know, each liquidity pool is just two assets in its own fishbowl. Is, like, the way I, like, think about it. But with bancorp.
00:08:40.310 - 00:09:44.024, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. But to go back on uniswap, you know, some pools like USDC and ETH might have lots of liquidity, so it's easy to swap between them. But for another obscure pool like rook bnt, liquidity might not be so high. So the slippage might be insanely high, but with Bancor I think of it as one giant fishbowl where there's bnt on the one side that everything is traded against and everything else on the other side. So it increases liquidity which lowers slippage which is a better experience for you and I. So with bancor vortex it basically sucks in all the b and t from the market into the protocol which increases liquidity and reduces slippage. And we can notice this by just like looking at the data, right? Total value locked on Bancor is increasing every single day and as TVL increases so does the trading swap fees and as you know, as the protocol generates more fees, you know, the protocol can just buy VBNT from the market and basically just accruing value back to the BNT token.
00:09:44.024 - 00:09:52.880, Speaker A: So that's the general summary of Bancor Vortex. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Thank you for watching and have a nice day.
