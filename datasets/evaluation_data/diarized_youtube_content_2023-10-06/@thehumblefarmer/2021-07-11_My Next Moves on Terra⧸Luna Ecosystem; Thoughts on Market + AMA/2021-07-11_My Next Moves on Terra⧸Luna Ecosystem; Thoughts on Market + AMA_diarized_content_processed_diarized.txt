00:00:06.640 - 00:00:44.341, Speaker A: How's it going, folks? Long time no see. Let me know if you can hear me and I'll get started and I'll give a. I'll give people a few minutes to hop onto the live stream. I know there's the Europe final right now, so I don't expect the stream to gather that many live viewers, but it's all good, you know, I mean, I make this content so that people can watch this three days from now, and it's. It'll still be valuable. So, you know, today I'll cover my next moves on Terra, right. So what I've already done so far, as well as give just my general thoughts about the market and as always, do the ama.
00:00:44.341 - 00:01:19.735, Speaker A: So let me know if you can hear me. Okay, so sounds good. All right, so let's get into the presentation. My next move on Terra. So I guess just a starter when the markets are kind of going. Going sideways, it's just a good time for, you know, you and I to just, like, learn about different ecosystems. And as I was studying, like Phantom Avalanche, you know, all these random chains, I figured, or I just saw, I just thought that Terra is the place to be in terms of forms.
00:01:19.735 - 00:01:35.895, Speaker A: Right. And the cool thing about the Terra ecosystem is that you don't even have to be like, uber bullish like Luna the Token. You can still like Farm Delta neutral and just like farm on stablecoin. So that's. That's what the video is going to be focused on, even though I am bullish. Luna. Okay, sounds good.
00:01:35.895 - 00:02:09.111, Speaker A: That being said, before I get started, I want to thank anyone that Contributed to my Gitcoin grants. I raised a little over $4,000. I've already purchased a new microphone. It hasn't arrived yet. So I guess the next video I'll upload will have much better audio quality. And I know I live near a train station, so sometimes you can hear me hear the train, but the new mic should alleviate that. And I'm not gonna bore anyone with like, my vacation, but, you know, it was kind of refreshing to just not look at the charts and like, see what's going on for like a week.
00:02:09.111 - 00:02:49.775, Speaker A: I was in Hawaii for five days and I just, like, wasn't really paying attention to markets. And I came back to, like, bitcoin being at the same price. I know like other coins, like pumped and dumped and all that stuff. But, you know, essentially, like, I left When Bitcoin was 34K, I came back when Bitcoin was 34K and it seemed like everyone was calling for A crash standard crypto Twitter stuff, right? And I recommend anyone just get a Twitter account, just like follow a bunch of people because it's a good way to gauge like market sentiment. Because like, I mean, at the end of the day bitcoin looks like this, right? I mean bitcoin is the king of the markets. It rules the markets. Everyone gets bullish up here and everyone gets bearish down here.
00:02:49.775 - 00:03:24.181, Speaker A: And that that's been going on for the past two months. And at some point, like the bears or the bulls, like one of them are going to be right? Because like it's not going to go sideways forever. It's going to break up or break down at some point. So, you know, it is what it is right now. It is what I call a crab market, right? Channeled a term coined by Donault the duck. But so far, I mean my thesis has been, you know, sideways market. Let's farm with stable coins and like less volatile assets and just outperform the market, right? Because any stable coin farmer has outperformed the market in the past two months.
00:03:24.181 - 00:04:00.637, Speaker A: So congrats to everyone. But today I want to make an announcement, I guess that I did purchase some Luna tokens. I'll go over why and how I'm deploying that. But my thesis is that, you know, like I said, crab market won't last forever. So I'm just like slowly deploying the cash that I've been farming with. And I guess like, if you think about like something, let's hypothetically imagine a really good farm with 120% APR calculated monthly, meaning that, you know, 12 months, that means 10% a month, right? Which is really good. Like this much better than anything in traditional equities in the traditional market.
00:04:00.637 - 00:05:07.109, Speaker A: But like 120% over a year, how does that compare to like buying bitcoin and having it like go up to six figures? Like I'm not calling for six figure bitcoin in under a year, right? No one can predict the markets. But sometimes like farming stable coins is good, but there is merit to just like buying something that you think will go up. But that doesn't mean like farming stable coins is bad, right? I mean there's always something positive about just having some cash, right, to be forming with because you can sleep better at night and you can always have dry powder to buy to dip. But like I mentioned, I bought some Luna, bought some Luna. And if you haven't checked out my video that I published Last week on July 4th, I did a collaboration video with Pete from Terabytes I did a overview of the general ecosystem, the opportunities available, and let's get started on what I'm doing. Right. So before I got on vacation with the stablecoins, I was farming Define tokens, right? I think I left when I had like 260ish tokens and I came back to like 90 more defined tokens, right? It's always nice to like come back from vacation and like having more tokens.
00:05:07.109 - 00:05:54.773, Speaker A: But as you can see under Popular Forums, you see that UST USDT is a liquidity pair on Define, meaning that you can like literally buy ust, right? Which you need for the Terra ecosystem, right? You can't port over ETH or Bitcoin to Terra just because it's a different chain. I believe Luna is also undefined. So what I did was I took all my stable coins and I swapped it to Terra to UST on the Polygon ecosystem through Define. Because if you were to like port it over to Ethereum and like buy UST on Curve or Uniswap, you have to like pay fees and I don't want to do that. So I just did all the swaps for like zero fees on Matic here. So, you know, I poured it over all of my stable coins that I had at the time. As you can see, it's like 16.4k.
00:05:54.773 - 00:06:25.169, Speaker A: I did it through the Matic bridge. It took me like half an hour. It was pretty fast for like little fees, which is nice. And after that I went to Bridge Terra Money and I just ported over all my UST to Terra and I think GUI gas was like 10 to 15, but I was able to do this for like a dollar in transaction fees. I don't know why it was so cheap, but it was really cheap. So it was actually a pretty seamless experience. I thought I'd have to pay multiple Ethereum gas fees, but I didn't really have to.
00:06:25.169 - 00:07:01.983, Speaker A: That being said, for the newbies, the Terra pros know this, but you have to download Terra Station. This is like the metamask for the Terra ecosystem. It's pretty good. It's really good. It's like it has like a dashboard and stuff. The Terra Station dashboard has like all the histories and like, you can stake it and stuff, but I mean, I'm not gonna go over all those details, but generally this is like the overview of my strategy. I'm gonna start out broad and then focus, I guess, narrow it down over time throughout the presentation where, you know, I put it over a little over $16,000 in stable coins.
00:07:01.983 - 00:07:49.335, Speaker A: I'm gonna convert some of that to Luna, right? To be Luna, to be specific, to put into Anchor, right? Because you need to put b Luna as collateral to borrow on Anchor. Then I'll borrow whatever safe amount I'll deposit remaining whatever I have stable coins into anchor to earn 20% and get a UST Aust is I guess, the claim to whatever dollars you have into Anchor, right? It's like when you deposit on aave. If you deposit aave. Sorry, if you deposit bitcoin to aave, you get like ABTC tokens, right? It's just like a claim on whatever you deposited. And the aus. The AUSD I get in return, I'll use that as collateral to short form on Mirror. I'll go over why I'm not doing the delta neutral strategy and why I'm not long farming later in the video.
00:07:49.335 - 00:08:31.175, Speaker A: But I feel like the general question I'll get is like, why aren't you staking Luna? Because I talked about it in my video with Pete that, you know, staking Luna gets you airdrops and you also get more Luna because of staking rewards. Right. I figured that I'll get better APR APYs on anchor, so I'm just taking advantage of the anchor APYs for now. And right now I took the screenshot yesterday, might be different, but the staking return Lon Luna is 7.3% a year. Right. Obviously this goes up and down as like the price of these tokens go up, but this already includes like the weekly air drops that you'll get for Mirror and Anchor as well as like the rewards and stuff.
00:08:31.175 - 00:09:08.213, Speaker A: And I can easily outperform this on Anchor, even though I am taking on a little bit more risk, which I'm okay with. But if you do want to stake on Luna on Terror Station, here's like my recommendation, I guess. Not like, not financial advice, but like, here's what I would do because if you go to like the delegation, the validator delegator tab, there's like a bunch of these people that you could be staking with, but it's kind of confusing, right? So generally you want to stake with someone with 0% commission or very low commission with 100% uptime. So there's like, no, you don't. Your. Your rewards won't get slashed. And the number one validator is Orion Money.
00:09:08.213 - 00:09:36.983, Speaker A: A6.6.3% of voting power is there, but. And this is because Orion is. Is a protocol and they're essentially allocating some of their Orion tokens to stakers, right? If you stake with Orion, you'll get airdrops, which is nice. And Orion is like a dex aggregator of Terra. I haven't looked too deep into it, but you know, it's, it's cool because like, I mean staking Luna gets zero drops, which is nice. It's like another form of yield.
00:09:36.983 - 00:10:20.483, Speaker A: Right. Obviously there's this, it raises the question of like, well, if everyone stakes with Orion, like it's not really decentralized, right? Because I mean all the voting power goes there. So to disincentivize people to stake on Orion and to incentivize people to go elsewhere. Do Kwon, who is the founder of Terra, said that the Nebula airdrop, which is the I guess algorithm, algorithmic ETF protocol, those, those airdrops will go into people that aren't that, that are like supporting validators with less voting power. So. And yeah, like, like I said, it's like an algorithm ETF which is like pretty interesting. So for example, I went over this with the video with Pete, but perhaps like number three, let it roll cluster.
00:10:20.483 - 00:10:53.611, Speaker A: Right. Like it's an ETF that takes the top five performing assets over the last 30 day period. So you're just owning the winners. Right. So it's a pretty interesting idea. So what I would personally do if I were to stake on Terra Station is that I would take half my Luna stack, put it on Orion to get those airdrops and then the other half I'll stake it with some other validator with maybe lower fees to get the Nebula airdrop. And the APR shouldn't change that much, but it's kind of diversifying who you're, who you're like staking with and you're just getting different airdrops.
00:10:53.611 - 00:11:34.787, Speaker A: Right. Okay. And obviously I don't know if you can see like the text is really small, but I mean these are all the protocols that are going to be launching soon on Terra and they're all going to be doing airdrops. From my understanding, if as long as you're staking Luna on Terra Station, so you know, if you're, you know, if you're like working a full time job, you don't want to deal with like liquidation price and whatnot on anchor, then this is like a pretty hands off way to just get free airdrops and just good APIs in general. Okay, so why Luna? So why am I putting my Luna on anchor? Well, like I said, anchor gives me better rates, so I'm just going to take advantage of it while it lasts. Took the screenshot yesterday. And the top right, you see the net APR is 93%.
00:11:34.787 - 00:12:11.193, Speaker A: So this is how much I'm going to be paid to borrow. If I use Luna as collateral and borrow stable coins against it, you see that the borrow APR is roughly 17%. So this is an interest rate I'm paying, but the protocol is going to Reward me with 110% of anchor tokens, right? So, you know, I think we were all spoiled in April and May when Matic and Aave, they were like paying us to borrow and we were like, oh my God, free money everywhere. But this is another form of free money. Obviously it's more risky because the only collateral available is B. Luna, which is a lot volatile than like stable coins or Bitcoin. And Luna is like the only collateral that they have right now.
00:12:11.193 - 00:12:46.205, Speaker A: But they're going to expand this to Ethan stuff and other assets. So this is the general overview of the strategy, but let's get into it deeper. So I started with sixteen and a half thousand dollars of us. So I just, I mean, I just like decided to take a round number 6.4k. So I have $10,000 of USD and I converted that to Luna, right? Be Luna and I'm going to borrow a safe amount of ust. Then after I take out that loan, I'll take that loan and 10 to $10,000 of UST and put it into anchor and earn 20%. Right? So 11 and a half.
00:12:46.205 - 00:13:33.209, Speaker A: So I borrowed 1.5 K, so 11 and a half thousand dollars into anchor and like I said, I'll get the AuSD in return and I'll use that as collateral on Mirror to Short Farm. So a quick tip that Pete mentioned is that if you go to terraswap IO, you can actually like swap Luna for like a lot more B Luna, just because when you unstake Luna, you have to wait 21 days to like get your Luna back. And some people are okay just paying up to I guess get their Luna immediately, right? Swapping their B Luna for Luna. Obviously, like, I have to like wait 21 days if I want to unstake. And I'd have to pay a premium to get back to Luna if I want to. But if you're converting Luna to be Luna, it's better to do this than like just taking the 800 Luna that I had and just bonding it on anchor.
00:13:33.209 - 00:13:52.325, Speaker A: So here's a little, I guess, quick tip Alpha. I mean, I earn like 3 1/2% more Luna tokens, right? Which is like, obviously nice. And I took this B. Luna, right. That I had and I just put it all into anchor. Right? And using that B. Luna as collateral, I'm borrowing $1,500 against it.
00:13:52.325 - 00:14:13.157, Speaker A: My liquidation price for B. Luna is 3.625. And this is, I mean, I find this unlikely given that I think Luna is a little over $8 right now. And I don't think this is going to happen overnight. Right. If Luna is like dumping, I'll like repay my loan or like add more collateral. So you know, I personally feel fine with this.
00:14:13.157 - 00:14:34.249, Speaker A: And you see the transaction FEES is like A$6 1.676 USD. So it's not as cheap as Matic, but it's cheaper than Ethereum and I think the APRs make up for it. So I'm totally okay doing this. So I'll show my dashboard later. But here's just like a screenshot of like what my setup is. You know, I guess after I bought Luna, it went up.
00:14:34.249 - 00:15:06.025, Speaker A: So I have roughly $7,000 of Luna borrowing $1,500 against it. And on the $1,500 I'm being paid 87%, right. Roughly 90% to I guess borrow. Right. Getting paid to borrow, you just have to be more careful with like how much you're borrowing just because Luna is a volatile asset. And in May it went from $22 to like $5 in like a week. So you know, these things can dip a lot just because it's an altcoin, right at the end of day, I mean Luna, I like the token, it's a pretty high market cap.
00:15:06.025 - 00:15:43.401, Speaker A: But you know, nothing is safe when bitcoin is dumping. And like I mentioned, eleven and a half thousand dollars, depositing it on anchor and. Yeah, and earning 19.5%. And my expected interest if 12 months from now, if I keep it in here, I'd have over $2,000 in interest, which is nice. And as you can see if you go to my wallet, there's $10.8K a USD. It's less than 12 and a half because Aust is a appreciating against UST just because it's like it's earning, it's earning 20% a year, right? So 10.10
00:15:43.401 - 00:16:15.321, Speaker A: 8K of Aust is the same thing as 12 and a half thousand dollars. So keep that in mind. And I guess I'm not going to go over this, but you can only short, you can only short, I guess an asset on mirror when the markets are open. Meaning like for me like 6:30 starting 6:30am on Monday. So I haven't been able to do this yet. But you know, I'm gonna just short and I'll show the dashboard later so you have a better understanding. But you know, I think this is pretty capital efficient if you think about it.
00:16:15.321 - 00:16:39.429, Speaker A: Like I started out with a little over $16,000. Now I deposited like $7,000 at the Luna. I borrowed 1.5k against it which is earning me 90%. Then on top of the 90% I'm putting that into Anchor which is going to earn me 20% right. On 11. And with the Aust I' use that as collateral to short form and be paid 30%.
00:16:39.429 - 00:17:21.735, Speaker A: Right. So I'd have to do the math on like how much I'm earning in total. But like this is pretty good, right? This is a pretty good form which is mostly centered around ust, right? So like you don't even have to be like super bullish Luna to like do this. You can just take ust like you can, you can skip step one where I bought Luna where maybe you don't, you don't want to like borrow against it. You just put everything into a, put all your ust into Anchor, use a UST as collateral on mirror and short something and do a delta neutral strategy. There's so much things you can do. And hey, like I think this is a pretty good stablecoin farm and me personally, I think this is better than anything that Matic offers right now for stablecoins.
00:17:21.735 - 00:17:56.977, Speaker A: Like I always mentioned, I am not a polygon maxi. I just happen to be on there because it had the best yields. I'm a yield maxi where I just want to deploy my capital where there's a highest yield with like little risk. And I see little risk in this outside of like the borrowing aspect. And I think Tarot is like a developed ecosystem where there's like a little, little chance of rug not financial advice. That being said, I'll just briefly go over like all the apps, Anchor, mirror, etc and then I'll look at the chat for questions if you have any. So reload.
00:17:56.977 - 00:18:23.369, Speaker A: But essentially this is my setup on Anchor on the earn tab like I mentioned. Okay. So like obviously like I had to like 11.494 K or 11,494 but over time. I did this yesterday but it's appreciated a little and I guess I foreshadowed that I'll be entering Luna. So like congratulations to anyone that front ran me. I think Luna was like $6 when I left for vacation.
00:18:23.369 - 00:18:42.107, Speaker A: I came back and I had to buy it at $8. I'm like, ah, God damn it. But it is what it is, so congrats. Anyone that front ran me. So what I have here is. This is Luna, right? This is how much Luna I have. So slowly deploying my stablecoin stack just because, I mean like a staking B.
00:18:42.107 - 00:19:17.937, Speaker A: Luna allows me to take out this loan which I'm being paid 87% for, right? And if you go to the government. Oh yeah. And this is like the bond, right? So if you didn't use Terra Swap, then if I had like 800 Luna, then I can only take like 800 B Luna, right? So which is less ideal? And with the anchor, I already have like almost two anchor tokens. I did this like less than 24 hours ago, which is like pretty nice. Like I'm earning rewards. You can either take that anchor, you can stake it, earn 5% or just be an LP. I'm not sure what I'll do yet with my anchor and mirror tokens.
00:19:17.937 - 00:19:37.005, Speaker A: I might just hold. I might just like convert it to Luna just so I can stack my Luna tokens. Maybe the thing I'll do is like I'll take all my rewards that I'm getting and I'll convert that to Luna and then I'll stake it with on Terra Station to get the air drops. That might be something I'll do. I haven't really decided yet. I just came back. So you know, but it's.
00:19:37.005 - 00:20:03.129, Speaker A: This is like a pretty good like, like money making machine I guess. And the only risk right here is like me being liquidated, right? So if the price of Luna gets to 360 to like overnight, then I'll get liquidated and I'll be a meme and I'm totally okay with that. Okay. Yeah. And Terraswap. See like if you go to Terraswap, you can earn like 4% more B. Luna, which is pretty nice.
00:20:03.129 - 00:20:39.549, Speaker A: So essentially. So this is Mirrordale Finance, right? I went over this in the video and essentially you can be paid to. You're essentially being paid in I guess, swap fees and mirror tokens. And if you want to long form it, you kind of just have to be an LP, right? You have to provide liquidity. 50%. Okay, maybe not GameStop, maybe like Airbnb, right? Provide like if you provide like five shares of Airbnb, then you have to provide this like the same dollar amount, right? So here's this being liquidity provider, there is risk of impermanent loss. But like, I mean it's stocks Right.
00:20:39.549 - 00:21:52.935, Speaker A: Stocks like it's not going to go up like 50% a day. And these assets outside of game, outside of the meme stocks, they're like pretty not volatile so I wouldn't be too worried about impermanent loss. And I guess like yeah, and the short farms are also pretty good and I guess like the question people might have is like why, why aren't I doing the delta neutral strategy, right? Where theoretically I can like long $2,000 worth of gold, right? Earn 29% and short $2,000 worth of gold and earn 80% so I don't really care if gold goes up or down, right? Because I'm delta neutral, right? Because I'm shorting and longing the same amount I would just be capturing roughly like 110% APY or APR. Yeah this is APR, it's not auto compounded. And the reason I'm not doing the delta neutral strategy, the reason I'm only shorting it is because I already own a bunch of these tech stocks on my brokerage account so and I own a bunch of index funds so like I don't really need to be delta neutral on mirror. I can just short it here and just like be delta neutral between Mirror and like my brokerage account. However I might like seeing this.
00:21:52.935 - 00:22:48.341, Speaker A: Like I like ask myself like why do I even own stocks on like a brokerage account? Like I'm not earning any yield. Like I should just if I want I own some Apple. Like well I shouldn't, I should just like long form Apple, right? Because like Apple is like it just like generally trends up over time and like I'm not really worried about impermanent loss and I can just like long form it. And the cool thing about Mirror is like as an American I don't have access to M Gal, I don't have access to Galaxy. Galaxy Digital, this is Mike Novogratz's company and I'm actually really interested in this stock and or I believe I don't have access so I might just long form a galaxy just because I like what they're doing. And if you think about it like the majority of Mirror users I believe are in Asia. Because if you think about like stonks like this is like the ultimate Ponzi, right? It just like goes up over time just because the money printer go brr.
00:22:48.341 - 00:23:40.193, Speaker A: And this is like the main reason Americans have money, right? Americans are like wealthier than normal just because America has, Americans have access to like tech companies which just goes up over time. So if you think about like Product market fit. Terra has like this Chai payments app which is used by like I believe 2 to 3 million, 2 to 3 million Koreans every single day. And I believe roughly 10% of all transactions happen on the Chai app. And what do Kwon wants to do? Like the founder of Terra is he wants to integrate anchor and mirror into the Chai app, at least in my opinion. I think, I don't think he mentioned it, but I mean I think that's the ultimate goal. So if you think about like this like a mobile application that lets you pay merchants with it, right? And it also allows you to have 20% APY on like dollars.
00:23:40.193 - 00:24:00.319, Speaker A: It's a savings account. And you can also like buy American stocks with it. Like that's the definition of product market fit. So that's why I'm like generally bullish on a macro scale, like the Luna ecosystem. And like why I'm okay like buying Luna tokens. Just because with Luna, like my friend told me about this like 25 cents and I'm like, no, fuck this. Like this is a pawn.
00:24:00.319 - 00:24:20.725, Speaker A: Like this, this is, this is a scam. Or I just like didn't really look into it. It was like I'll go stablecoin, like screw that. And then it went to like $20 and I'm like damn, I missed 100x. But you know, at $8 I got in like at 750ish, I forget. But I feel okay buying it. That being said, I'll look at the chat and answer any questions that might have.
00:24:20.725 - 00:25:04.563, Speaker A: I think the presentation and like this overview kind of covered it. And if anything the Pete, the video with Pete from Terabytes also does it well. And I'll also go over other resources, I guess, other content creators that I think is really good. Okay. Yeah, generally like I would something cool about define is that it has ust and I think as Luna, I'm not sure how much liquidity it has. And this thing only has eleven and a half million dollars of liquidity. So I had to pay some slippage.
00:25:04.563 - 00:26:16.511, Speaker A: But you know, it definitely beats beating it definitely beats paying Ethereum fees for sure. Yeah. And the reason that mirror like one like pays you so much to short is because I mean the mirror tokens, these synthetic assets have a premium, right? So the gold trust at IAU has a 2% premium, right? It's 2% higher priced than like what it actually is right on the stock market. So it's like trying to incentivize people to short it just so they can bring the Premium down. And, you know, if I'm going to be paid 80%, then, like, why not, right? Who cares? Let's see, where's the former hat? If I wear the farmer hat all the time, it kind of loses its, I guess, like, mystique, right? I only. I'm only gonna bring out the farmer hat when, you know, I'm really excited. I mean, I'm still super excited about this, but, you know, it's.
00:26:16.511 - 00:26:49.521, Speaker A: I can't wear it every single video. It kind of loses its power, right? Because right now, like, I bring it out, like, maybe once every two weeks and everyone's like, fuck, yeah, there it is. One thing I mentioned is that these long farms, they're APRs, right? So it's not auto compounded, right? And let's see. So for example, like Airbnb, it's 53%, but it's not auto compounded. So it would be really cool if there was an auto compounder, right? And there actually is one. It's called Spectrum. It's not audited right now.
00:26:49.521 - 00:27:21.131, Speaker A: And I talked to a few people and they said, like, I guess like Luna experts. And they were like, yeah, I'm not going to touch this until it's audited and until like, it's. I guess it has like more clout and more like Lindy Effects. But, you know, right now, I mean, these APRs are pretty good. I mean, Google, like, I can be paid 600 APY to be an LP and like, this definitely beats holding Google in my brokerage account. Obviously it's going to go down like, once it's safer, right? Once it's audited, more people put more. Put their money in it.
00:27:21.131 - 00:27:54.855, Speaker A: But this is something that I'm watching, right? Like, for example, like, I own like a bunch of Apple stock. Like, I might just sell all that and just put it into a mirror and just like, farm with it. Because, I mean, why not? Fidelity ain't doing shit and like, Robinhood ain't doing shit to like, give me money or, like, paying me to, like, use their application. And this is like the general power of these crypto protocols, Defi protocols. It's like they want you to use it and they're willing to pay you their governance tokens. And I guess also, like, if you earn mirror, you can stake it. Pretty good.
00:27:54.855 - 00:28:37.593, Speaker A: Pretty good, Yeah. I don't own anything, but. And these forms are good. Have I looked into Pylon? Not really. I know like, I know like, some Twitter shills are talking about it, but I'm just focusing on These two protocols right now, just because, like, this is, like, what I feel comfortable talking about. Why are you Looking to stake ETH 2.0 when you acquire 32 ETH, why risk locking in your capital? Yeah, I mean, that's a valid point, but I mean, I don't.
00:28:37.593 - 00:29:00.085, Speaker A: I don't even own even close to 32 ETH. But once I get there, like, I just see that as, like, my forever bag. I just want to stake it and just forget about it. Right? I think it's always good to just have, like, bitcoin in, like, a cold wallet that you, like, won't touch. It's just, like, it's just something that you, like, forget about. And if I. If I were to successfully accumulate 32 eth, I would think about it that way as well.
00:29:00.085 - 00:29:29.147, Speaker A: Okay. Having said, it seems like not that many questions are being asked. So I'm just gonna go into the ama, I guess, before I get into the ama, actually, I'm still in this bitcoin farm or this curve farm on my bitcoin, right? I have like 15, like, all my bitcoin. It's, it's. It's still in curve. Obviously, like, this isn't that great, right? I'm earning like 5.6%, 5.8%,
00:29:29.147 - 00:29:51.821, Speaker A: right. Which is okay. I mean, I can't really get that anywhere else. But I'm looking into this now, H5 crypto, and people are like, people don't want to touch this because of, like, the risk of impermanent loss. But, like, and, like, I didn't want to touch that, like, while I was on vacation because I couldn't. I wasn't able to manage it. But, like, now that I'm back, like, I'm probably.
00:29:51.821 - 00:30:25.355, Speaker A: I'm probably gonna go back because this is like, what, like, 27% AP APR just for, like, being a liquidity provider. Bitcoin ETH and stablecoins. It's pretty good because at the end of the day, like, bitcoin eth here. So this is a impermanent loss calculator. It's. I went over this on, like, I guess, like my one off videos a lot. But, like, the A crypto pool is like three assets paired, I guess, in equal amounts.
00:30:25.355 - 00:31:10.269, Speaker A: And if bitcoin were to go up 50% and eth went up 75%, like, you're only taking in, like, that much impermanent loss. So, like, I'm sure, like, no matter, like, unless something crazy happens where, like, bitcoin just goes flat and like, ETH just create this goes just decouples. I mean, even then, like, it's still not that bad. Right? And if you compare. So let's just take this likely scenario of like, if bitcoin goes up 50%, then eth goes up 75%. So this is impermanent loss for the 3H5 crypto pool and comparing it to like, what if you just provide liquidity for the bitcoin and eth, and then obviously it's a little bit more impermanent loss just because you have exposure to dollars. Right? So when two assets outperform, then you're gonna.
00:31:10.269 - 00:31:43.765, Speaker A: The pool will sell those assets to buy the underperforming asset, which is the dollars. So I'm probably gonna move over my funds there just because, like, I don't really see that big of a risk. And the APRs are pretty good. I mean, damn, that's a lot of curve, That's a lot of Matic, and that's a lot of swap fees. Yeah, you can earn more on like, Celsius and like blockfi. But like, my general thesis that like, these CEFI and Defi. Sorry, these CEFI companies, like, they're.
00:31:43.765 - 00:32:13.605, Speaker A: They're gonna have to lower their rates. Like BlockFi. Like, they used to offer like 6.5% on Bitcoin up to like 2 Bitcoin, and now like, it's like 5% up to like 0.5. Bitcoins, like, it's like, what the fuck? Like, there's like, they just keep lowering rates and I see that trend just going over time and I just like the flexibility of having my assets on defi protocols. That being said, let's get into the AMA. Thanks for the 40 people that submitted their questions.
00:32:13.605 - 00:32:42.825, Speaker A: See, and after this, there weren't that many questions. But after I go, after I go through this, I'll look at the chat for questions. So feel free to save your questions and hopefully I can answer most of your questions here. So I went over this, but like, typical gas fees is like roughly a dollar. I'd say roughly a dollar. So it's not like matic, where you can play with like $10 and like, it's fine, right? I wouldn't play on tarot with like $10 or even $100. Maybe $1,000 is good enough.
00:32:42.825 - 00:33:34.771, Speaker A: But you know, the yields like, I shared is like, pretty good, right? So I feel fine with it. So I get this question a lot, almost every live stream, but. And I think it's fine to address them just because there's like, new subscribers every single time. But in terms of like best farms for beginners, like if you're a beginner, like you shouldn't go for the highest APYs just because like you're less knowledgeable and you might like, you might fuck up, right? Like to be frank. So what I would recommend is like if you're new, just go on Polygon or yeah, just go on Polygon and like deposit someone deposit some assets on aave, right? And like over the next few days it's like watch your numbers grow. It's like holy shit, like it's actually paying me. And once you're understanding like, okay, like I'm being paid because there's no middleman.
00:33:34.771 - 00:34:26.455, Speaker A: There's peer to peer lending of money, lending and borrowing of money, like fuck the banks, then you can borrow some assets against it, right? Like so $1000 in Dave borrow like $500 of stablecoin then like holy shit. I didn't have to even talk to anyone on the bank. I just took out this loan and then take those dollars and put it into a stablecoin form like an LP farm and be like, okay, this is how I provide liquidity and this is how I earn these governance tokens. And over time you're going to slowly learn, okay, this is how things work. And as long as you use these protocols, it'll help you assess how good future projects will be. I think the best way to learn about DEFI is to use it. So I would just start really conservative and then as you learn expand your risk horizon.
00:34:26.455 - 00:35:11.884, Speaker A: So like I mentioned you can, you can purchase UST on Polygon for zero fees essentially. So I would do that instead of like trying to do it on Ethereum just because gas fees are kind of expensive. So multi part question, if you stake on Terra Station, you can't use them on other platforms, right? So if you stake it on Terra Station, you can't like bond the b Luna to on anchor. So that's why I'm like focusing on Anchor right now. And I kind of went over this. Like I just compared to numbers and I said I can outperform Terra staking, Luna staking just by being an anchor. So you know, just do the math and it's not too difficult.
00:35:11.884 - 00:36:05.311, Speaker A: I just do that. Yeah. So I don't do price predictions because I think price predictions are full of shit. But you know, I see I am like a long term bullish Luna and I feel fine just like owning some and like using it as collateral and like doing all these farm strategies just because Luna is like the Only crypto that has like a real world use case, right? Like yeah, like Luna, like it's actually used by millions of Koreans and like mirror is used by like a bunch of Asian people. Just because there's like people don't have access to like US stocks. And the idea that there could be a mobile application, right, that could be used for I guess e commerce and like retail payments that also has integrated like a 20% APY savings protocol as well as like a synthetic asset trading, I guess, app. I think there's this value in that.
00:36:05.311 - 00:36:28.565, Speaker A: I think there's product market fit. So I always showed this 20 cents, 25 cents. Didn't buy it. I don't mind buying it higher just because I understand it better. Right? Yeah. So I mean I get this question every single time. It's like, what do you think about my farm token? Like is it going to go up? And 98% of the time the farm token just goes to zero, right? I mean it just makes sense.
00:36:28.565 - 00:37:05.975, Speaker A: Like there's zero utility for the token and it's, it's the native token that's being paid out in terms of yield. So obviously it's going to just go down over time, right? Like, and it's like collecting coins in a farm bill. You are collecting something that hopefully will have value, right? And I feel like a lot of people like they just like in every video I just say like farm tokens go to zero and like people like get mad. It's like, no, like this farm is different. This farm has burned, right? This farm burns. This. It's like this farm burned a thousand tokens today, right? But I'm like, it also minted like 10,000 tokens today, so it doesn't really matter.
00:37:05.975 - 00:37:36.531, Speaker A: And I have a business background. I went to school, I went to business school and I specialized in marketing. But one of the things that stuck in my head is that, I mean this isn't like a novel concept but hope is not a strategy, right? Because this guy's like, hopefully it will have value, right? Hope is not a strategy. It's like this is a good comic of like our new strategy is to sell fewer units at higher margins. Question, how's that different from saying our sales stink so we're cutting costs? I call it a strategy so you won't lose hope. It's working great. And I think this is a lot.
00:37:36.531 - 00:38:15.443, Speaker A: I think this is like what a lot of defi protocols do, right? Like especially farms. It's like, you know, we have an anti whale mechanism. You know, we have A deflationary token because we burn things. It's like we're introducing a new partnership and it's just like a bunch of like random Twitter posts that like make make their whatever farm sound exciting. But at the end of the day, like they're minting, like they're just like minting tokens to like, most tokens go like mint to infinity. Like whatever that they burn doesn't matter even if they have a cap supply of the, of the token supply, right? It's like it doesn't really matter because long term, like it has no value. Like, let's say there's a farm with a cap supply.
00:38:15.443 - 00:39:08.739, Speaker A: Like, you should always ask yourself, like, if I were to enter one year coma, would I ever hold this token? And 99% of the time the answer is no. Just because like, what the fuck does this token do? Like, it doesn't do anything. At least with like AAVE and like Uniswap, like these protocols are generating revenue and I can see that 10 years out, you know, they're gonna be much bigger than where they are now, right? Same goes for Luna. As long as there's utility for ust, the Luna token should appreciate in value, right? So, and I feel comfortable holding Aave Uni Luna for like 5 year time horizon. But like these random farm tokens, like don't fall into this trap of like, you know, like, of this like shiny new farm with like a new tokenomics because 98% of the time it doesn't work. I don't mean to fud people out of their farms because there are farms that do last longer and if you do the research, like those farms can make you a lot of money. For example, polycat.
00:39:08.739 - 00:39:31.631, Speaker A: I was in polycat in April and I got out of it after break even because I just like didn't. I just like didn't see a future. But obviously like they were like the long. One of the longest lasting farms on Polygon. And anyone that was in Polycat since April made, made a fuck ton of money. Definitely a lot more money than me. So if you're able to identify those, then go for it.
00:39:31.631 - 00:40:10.093, Speaker A: But at the end of the day, it's like all farm tokens are like this, right? It's like they make it sound nice, right? It's like this is our new strategy. Like we're like doing all these things, but in the back end it's just, it's just an, it's just another farm, right? And it's probably going to die. So hopefully I might have to say this, I might have to address this in every live stream, but there you go. Okay. I thought this was like a ridiculous question. I mean, I always say, like, do your own research. And I say that, like, if I get rugged, the only person is to blame myself.
00:40:10.093 - 00:40:51.841, Speaker A: And I think I generally, I'm very, very careful when I introduce a farm on my channel. When my channel was like less than 5,000 subscribers, I was just like throwing out these random farms because I didn't really have an audience. But now that I have, I feel like I have some. I have a sense of responsibility now that I have a bigger audience. So generally the farms that I'll introduce is something I consider to be pretty safe, right? There is always a chance of rug and you have to always do your own research. If I talk about something and you get rugged, like, you know, at the end of the day, you're the one that put your money in that farm, right? And I get rugged. The only place person to blame is myself, even if, like, my friend recommends it to me.
00:40:51.841 - 00:41:44.335, Speaker A: So, you know, just, you know, you just, you just have to use your head. What's an upfront cost to yield decent profit from farming? I think the upfront cost is time. You can't just like enter yield farming and like expect to make money. It's like trading, right? It's like, you can't just like leverage trade and like expect to make money, right? I mean, maybe you can. If it's like we're on this up only bull market, right? If you got into bitcoin in like August, then like, yeah, you can like 3x leverage and you're probably super rich, but you probably don't have longevity as a trader. So for me personally, like, I just immersed myself as a farmer, humble, honest farmer, and I learned these different strategies over time and I'm a much better farmer than I was a month ago, right? And the goal is just always be better and always go where their yield is and like, not be a maxi, right? Just don't be a maxi. Just go where the yields are and just be safe about it.
00:41:44.335 - 00:42:18.295, Speaker A: Kind of went over this, so I wanted to adjust the second question. It's like, why are, why are people using ust, right? It's like, why do people, why are people actually using ust? And for my knowledge, it's because it's. The merchant just gets like less fees, right? Because I own, I own a. I own a coffee business, right? I own a coffee business. We do a lot of E commerce and we have to use stripe like, out of necessity, right? This is. If you, like, buy something online, chances are, like, it uses stripe and stripe. Like, look at this.
00:42:18.295 - 00:42:41.593, Speaker A: Every time I sell something, like, I have to pay this this much in fees and transactions, which is ridiculous, right? This definitely cuts into our cost. And I think the Chai app, if you use UST, merchants only have to pay like 1% or something. Or I forget the number. But this is a pretty big cost, right? Because if you're doing millions in volume, then. I don't do millions of volume. I do hundreds of volumes. Small coffee comedy.
00:42:41.593 - 00:43:24.349, Speaker A: But this really cuts into the cost. So merchants will easily adopt Terra or the Chai app, like the payments app, just because the fees are lower and over, like, obviously, like, the more sales you do, like, those fees add up. So I think that's one of the ways. That's one of the reasons, like, there's so much adoption there, because Korean merchants just want to get lower fees. So, okay, I also get this question a lot. Like, I don't really understand, like, what's so difficult, but I'll like, address it if it's confusing. So like, for example, like on AAVE, like, I have like $20,000 deposited.
00:43:24.349 - 00:44:24.011, Speaker A: I borrow like $10,000 and like two weeks later, like, my debt is gone. Right? Everyone's like, where did it go? Like, aren't you down money? And like, literally, like, I took $10,000, I put it into a farm and accumulated tokens, and I put it back, paid it back, and like, does that not make sense? Like, I'm not, like, when I take out debt, I'm not like, spending it, right? I'm just farming with it. So is that confusing? So that's why that's how I pay back my loans. Yeah. So back in April and May, there was a point to use stables as collateral and borrow stables against it just because you were being paid to borrow on both sides. But now that the rewards are lower, I don't think there's as much value in it. AAVE is still really, really good, right? Because, yes, I mean, yes, the rewards are lower.
00:44:24.011 - 00:45:07.397, Speaker A: You're not being paid to borrow, but you do still get rewards, which is non zero. And if you use like bitcoin or ether as collateral and like, you don't want to sell your bitcoin or ether, I mean, I can take out a loan for like, Dai and like pay like 1 or 2% and farm with it and earn like 20%. So you're still making money. So I mean, it's not like, as sexy as it was like a few months ago, but come on guys, it's fun. Yeah. So define is something that like I think could have future value, right? It's not like it's not like you. I am forming it, right, and I'm earning it for free.
00:45:07.397 - 00:45:34.947, Speaker A: But it's an exchange token which is like a cross chain exchange. And I do think that it could have fundamental value. Like I also wouldn't not be, I also would not be surprised if it went to zero. So like you know, like I'm not trying to show this thing because like, you know, I have no idea. But it's something similar to Cheetah where I was farming it at 30 cents and I sold it near $3. And I think that's something that I'll be doing with DFIN or define like all this farm to accumulate. I'm not gonna burn the 50%.
00:45:34.947 - 00:45:47.291, Speaker A: I'm fine waiting. I'm fine waiting. And if it goes up, then I'll sell it. Like I'm not loyal to this token. If it goes up, I'll sell. Simple as that. Yeah.
00:45:47.291 - 00:46:43.405, Speaker A: So this is something I went over in middle of May, right when the markets tanked. I said that I am no longer going to be participating in degen yield forms because people are, people got wrecked and the risk tolerance is low. So and don't get me wrong, there are people that has made a lot of money degen yield farming, right? So like if you do your research and you identify these things, yes you can. But me personally, like think about it like people lost half their money, right? And if you're like a high risk retail investor, you might have lost like 70% of your money if you like didn't hold bitcoin or ether. Like if you were like all in all coins, right? And you just got wrecked and those people were the ones degen yield farming and those people have less money to farm with. And if people have less money to farm with then you know, these farms have a shorter lifespan. And if we are in a bear market then these developers are more likely to rug just because they can, they can make less money from these farms.
00:46:43.405 - 00:47:13.015, Speaker A: So all those reasons are the reasons why I am not DJ neod farming right now. Don't get me wrong, if bitcoin just fucking pumps like if bitcoin hits like 60k like I'll be back in there with you guys, right? I'll probably do a live stream. I'm like, yeah, like I'm in this fucking Ponzi guys. Let's fucking go. And I'LL like, I'll go back to being a degen, but right now I'm just being more conservative. I'm like going into these safer farms, which still earn a pretty good yield. I mean, Mirror Anchor still pretty good.
00:47:13.015 - 00:47:42.645, Speaker A: Yeah. So I've had some content creators ask me, like, how do I get started if I want to make a YouTube channel? At the end of the day, you just have to kind of go for it. It's okay if your content is not good to begin with because go back to my very first video. I made it like 10 months ago or something. Eight months ago, I made a video on bitcoin and I was a fucking noob. I didn't even know what ether was. I didn't know what defi was.
00:47:42.645 - 00:48:25.807, Speaker A: I was a bitcoin maxi that was like making videos on Michael Saylor. Making videos on, like, why money printing gober is good for bitcoin. It was awful, right? In hindsight, it's awful. I mean, it's still a pretty good video if you like, if I were to show it to a friend who doesn't know anything about crypto, but like, who the fuck wants to watch that? It's so saturated. But you just have to be consistent and you have to find your niche. Because I was making like fundamental analysis videos and which on my best day got like a thousand views, like 2000 views, which is like pretty good, but like not great. And my channel caught on when I just started like fucking going ham on matic, just going DJ and YOLO farms when farmer hat.
00:48:25.807 - 00:49:37.695, Speaker A: And in hindsight, it's pretty obvious that, hey, like crypto YouTubers, like, they mostly do TA, right? They just draw head and shoulders patterns and like draw trend lines and say it's going to go up. And like, I feel like if you're starting at a new channel, the odds of you being successful as like a farming channel compared to like a trading channel, I think a farmer channel is more likely to succeed, right? Because most YouTubers, crypto YouTubers, they're fucking garbage. It's total garbage. They just like pump scams. They talk about like, they just like talk about meme coins and like you can kind of see like the quality of these YouTube channels by looking at their subscriber to viewer ratio, right? Because my videos, they get like at least 10,000 views, right? For like someone with like 46k subscribers, it's pretty good, right? That means my audience is engaged. But some channels, they have like 100,000 subscribers, but their videos get 3,000 views, right? It's like what the fuck? Like those people, they get subscribers through like meme coins, right? And like they talk about like the next 1000X which no one frankly gives. Gives a shit about at least in my opinion because it's not that easy.
00:49:37.695 - 00:50:16.873, Speaker A: And like people subscribe because they like, they talk about random meme coin but like they're not really engaged. And I think like, like I mentioned like I've shouted out many channels before if I think their content is great, content is good. I'm about to do that in the next few minutes and like there's not that many good defi crypto like farmer channels, right? Like come on guys, like I'm sure most of you are fucking pros and I'm sure most of you guys are degens. Let's go, let's. Let's create more defi content. Because it can't just be me, right? It can't just be me. Do you have any Matic left? No, I just have.
00:50:16.873 - 00:50:44.735, Speaker A: I just converted most of my assets to bitcoin and stable. Stable coins. Hold on. Before this question I'll just talk about this just because I was on this topic like what are some good resources on Terra? So terabytes. Really good. I learned about Tera through them. I have them to thank for, for like learning about the ecosystem and I've had them on, on my channel.
00:50:44.735 - 00:51:11.021, Speaker A: Really good content. Every week they have like these tutorials and like these interviews. Really good. I also like his channel. He's a little bit under undiscovered but shout out to you Danker or Danku R. I feel like he's like some like Luna maxi. Maybe he's not but like he like does a lot of content about like how do you master anchor and mirror? And he like does spreadsheets and stuff.
00:51:11.021 - 00:51:33.035, Speaker A: It's pretty good. Next. Joseph. Joseph L I O W on Twitter. He's also pretty good. He's helped me a lot recently. I asked him a bunch of questions and he has his medium or he has a medium page where he like talks about like how it, how it works, the state of decentralization, different ways to earn like very in depth articles.
00:51:33.035 - 00:52:28.873, Speaker A: So I suggest, I mean those three sources I, you know, give him a shout out. Right? If you make good content I'll give you a shout out. All right, let's see. Does farming have a long term career outlook? Yes. I mean because there's always liquidity mining programs, right? Because farming I guess as a job, I guess yield farming in crypto is a job. It exists just because there's always, like, new protocols that's like, trying to incentivize you to put your assets on their protocol to, like, bootstrap their application, right? And if you think crypto is not going to die, like, I don't think crypto is going to die. There's always going to be liquidity mining programs because, you know, these protocols, they're competing with each other for your liquidity, right? And me, like, I took my liquidity away from Polygon right into.
00:52:28.873 - 00:52:44.791, Speaker A: Into the Terra ecosystem. Because the Terra ecosystem had the best rewards. And, you know, I'm not a Polygon maxi. I'm just like, okay, like, Terra gives me the highest yield. I go there, right? Like, I'm not. Like, I'm not that. I'm not a complex band, right? I'm a simple man.
00:52:44.791 - 00:53:22.305, Speaker A: I'm a simpleton, right? I'm just like, okay, more. Higher number. Seems pretty safe. I go there and I don't think this is going to end anytime soon. And I feel like even as an investor, like, you kind of have to use these protocols to understand, like, okay, like, does this thing have a future? And using these protocols have given me, like, a much better understanding of, like, I guess, like, my investment thesis on, like, different altcoins. Right? Simple question, but, like, if I use Bitcoin as collateral to like, mint assets, am I exposed to impermanent loss? No. Because, well, if Bitcoin goes up, that means you can.
00:53:22.305 - 00:53:54.553, Speaker A: I mean, you're not providing liquidity. You're just like, if bitcoin goes up, that means you can just borrow more. If Bitcoin goes down, you can borrow less and you might have to repay your loan or you have to repay, like, whatever you. Whatever asset you meant. So simple question. Yeah, I guess comparing, like, staking, taking your Luna on Anchor versus, like, just staking on Terra Station is like, if you're. If you're a busy person, you're going on vacation, you don't want to worry about liquidations.
00:53:54.553 - 00:54:16.339, Speaker A: Just stake it on in. Stake it on Terra Station, come back, come home, and, like, have more coins, right? Pretty nice. But right now Anchor has the higher yield, right? Just because they're paying me to borrow. That's why I'm doing it. Once those rewards, like, run out, I don't know when they're going to run out. But if it runs out, then I'll go. I'll look somewhere else, right? Like, I'm not a maxi for any application.
00:54:16.339 - 00:54:41.005, Speaker A: I'm just going where the yield is. How many telegram groups? No, I Don't I have a discord group link in the description. Last question. What are the best sources of information to use and to study? Well, for Terra, I just shared it with you. I think Bankless is good in terms of, like, general eth. Maxi content. But at the end of the day, the best way to learn is by using these protocols that.
00:54:41.005 - 00:55:17.045, Speaker A: I mean, would you rather, like, read a book about, like, playing a sport, or would you rather play the sport? Right. It's, like, similar to that. Like, you might get rugged, you might get wrecked, you might lose some money. But, you know, I think of it as tuition, right? I mean, if I. If you think crypto is going to be much bigger than, like, where we are in, like, five, 10 years ago, five, 10 years from now, then, like, why not just learn? Because I personally think that me using these protocols, me understanding them, like, five years from now, like, I'll be a lot better off than I am right now. I haven't made it yet, but the goal is to make it. So that wraps up the questions.
00:55:17.045 - 00:55:43.005, Speaker A: Let me know. So now I'll look at the chat for questions. I'll answer directly. I'm not going to talk about random shills, so don't ask me. I'm sure most of you will try, but I'm not going to talk about some garbage Ponzi that you're part of. Okay, I don't want to say garbage Ponzi, but, you know, you get the point. So for those wondering, the link to this is.
00:55:43.005 - 00:56:08.205, Speaker A: Is this, right? So this is the impermanent loss calculator. If you want to experiment with two assets, three assets, four assets, whatever this is. This made us. This is made for, like, balancer pools. Because I know Balancer also has incentives, which is pretty good. And I think someone on Balancer made this impermanent loss calculator so more people would use their app. All right.
00:56:08.205 - 00:56:29.019, Speaker A: Yeah. How is Hawaii, dude? I. I eat, like, a poke bowl every day. Like, I'm Japanese, so I like, obviously, I love raw fish. Like, sushi. I know poke is not like sushi, but I mean, I. I love salmon.
00:56:29.019 - 00:56:50.225, Speaker A: I ate that every single day. Like, my girlfriend was like, what the. Like, this is your. Like, it's literally like, I had dinner at like, 6pm and then at 8pm, like, I got a poke bowl. And she was like, oh, my God, like, you're gonna take a fat dump in a few hours. I'm like, yeah, definitely. And I did a hike called Coco head.
00:56:50.225 - 00:57:05.115, Speaker A: It's like, 40. It's like 40 minutes of, like, stairs. I almost died, but the view was nice. And I had like, the best Tonkatsu ever. This place called, like, Tonkatsu Ginza Viren. Biting. It's like a.
00:57:05.115 - 00:57:48.851, Speaker A: What is it in English? Like fried pork cutlet, right? Oh, my God. I think I gained like five pounds. But it was good. I mean, also, like, emotionally too. Like, if you were like, just looking at the charts all day for the past week, like, you might be like, wondering, like, what did I just spend my life on? Because the price hasn't changed. And, you know, maybe the price is gonna just roam between 30 to 40k for the next month or two, right? And at that point, like, maybe it's good to just take a few days off and just like, farm on stable coins, go somewhere nice on vacation and come back to more coins. Because, you know, like, me coming back to more coins, right? Like, for define and like curve and matic and stuff.
00:57:48.851 - 00:58:04.629, Speaker A: It's like, feels good. I'm a Sushi Maxi. Yeah, I'm a Sushi Maxine that way. Yeah. Kucoin chain. Yeah, I was looking at that. I was talking to someone and he said, like, there's a lot.
00:58:04.629 - 00:58:21.991, Speaker A: There's like a lot of rugs on Kucoin right now. I know, I know. Kucoin is like ripping off bsc. I mean, I feel like a bunch of companies should. I mean, like, why not try it, right? It's just like a money maker. It says money grab. Because I feel like in January or February I would.
00:58:21.991 - 00:58:53.733, Speaker A: There was. People were excited about Huobi, Huobi Eco Chain. And I looked into it and it just like went to zero, I think. It's like, no one went to it. And I feel like Kucoin is going to be similar, right? Because Binance is. Binance Smart Chain was successful because Binance is the largest, largest exchange, right? I think 33%, roughly, of all trading volume goes through Binance, which is insane, right? That's like a near monopoly. So if BSC or if finance is like a direct on ramp to bsc, like, obviously, like, money will flow there.
00:58:53.733 - 00:59:17.689, Speaker A: But Kucoin and like, Huobi, like, who uses that? Like, I don't really use it. I mean, I have an account, I think, but, like, I don't really use it, so I don't really think that much money will go there. I'd rather look into, like, Phantom or like Arbitrum when it launches. Like when the. Is Arbitrum, like, what the fuck? It's been so long. They were like, hyping it up they're like, oh yeah, like we'll launch in a few weeks and then we just like don't hear from them. But you know, it is Ethereum.
00:59:17.689 - 01:00:29.541, Speaker A: Like Ethereum. When you're in Ethereum land, you should just expect delays. Which, I mean, which I'm okay with. Like I'd rather wait like an extra month and like make sure my funds are safe than like launch something early but just like take so long. So long. See? Are you purchasing any insurance to mitigate risk? Not really. Because I mean maybe I should but like I don't really use apps that I think I need insurance in and I feel like insurance is just like a, it's just like a messed up industry, right? Because if you think about health insurance, like people that are low risk, like for me, for me, like I'm, I'm healthy, I eat well, I sleep well, right? Like my insurance costs are low, right? And like I don't really need insurance, I'm just like required by law to have it.
01:00:29.541 - 01:01:46.279, Speaker A: But if you're like an old person with like health issues like history, histories, like you have to pay up, right? Because insurance companies like don't really want to cover those people. So like for example, like Nexus Mutual, right, The insurance protocol, like they'll cover like the safe apps, right? Because like they're, I mean they're safe to begin with. So like they'll like try to make money by insuring them, right, Those funds, but they're not going to cover like dangerous applications because it's too risky. So I feel like it's hard to make an insurance model work in defi just because the incentives aren't aligned. So that being said, like I'd rather just like not pay for insurance because I'm like probably using applications where I don't think I need insurance, but maybe I'm just, I'm just a degen who knows. Pickle finance 70% API on stablecoin. Did you listen to my live stream? I'm earning 20% on anchor and I'm also earning 90% borrowing money and I can use anchor to short farm for like very high APYs, right? Nothing against us.
01:01:46.279 - 01:02:36.965, Speaker A: I didn't mean that to be sound aggressive, but I'm just saying like, yes, I looked at all those opportunities and I think that Terra for stablecoins is the best place to be because these farming strategies, like let's say, let's say you give no fucks about the Terra ecosystem, right? You think it's a Ponzi, you think it's a Scam right, that. But you don't think it's going to rug then like, you don't even have to take on like a Luna exposure. I have some Luna exposures because I like the coin but you know, I have like 7k of Luna. Like let's imagine like you give no shits about Terra, you give no fucks about Luna, right? And you just want to form with dollars. Well, let's put all your dollars here right on anchor, right? Earning 20%, right? 20% to begin with. And you get a USD in return. And you can use that a USD as collateral to short form, right.
01:02:36.965 - 01:03:08.485, Speaker A: And if you're feeling frisky, then you can do a delta neutral strategy, like longing the same amount of assets on both sides. So like this, I think this is like a better place to park your stable coins than on Matic right now. Just my opinion. Always your own research. Do what you're comfortable with. And it is kind of a pain in the ass to download Terra Station and bridge your assets over. But it took me like an hour because the Matic bridge takes like 30 to 45 minutes.
01:03:08.485 - 01:03:47.087, Speaker A: But it's not too difficult. And I think it's always, I think it's good to like just have funds on like different blockchains that you're like positive on. Positive as in like not bearish, like neutral to bullish on just so you can like, just so you have funds available to like deploy and everything. Yeah, and I don't. Yeah, like, obviously I'm bullish Ethereum, but I just like don't cover Ethereum just because the fees are too high. I mean, there are a bunch of like ETH maxis that like, say, like, oh my God, like WI fi is so good. And like, I mean WI fi is good, but like WI fi only works for rich people, right? And myself included.
01:03:47.087 - 01:04:21.979, Speaker A: And like majority of people, like, we're not like uber rich. Like, we have to work with like what's available. And like those eth maxis, like, they're rich to begin with and they're not really relatable, right? Just like a bunch of rich white guys saying, like, I bought Eth and I love Eth. Eth to the moon, $100,000 price target. Like, okay, like, fuck you. Like, I'm gonna try to make it by these farms. That's also like, point to, like, if you want to make content, like, just I would like, look at what I did because I think in hindsight, like, I didn't know, but like it made sense.
01:04:21.979 - 01:05:13.145, Speaker A: Like farming content does well, because there's no one covering it, right? Like, if you're creating a new channel like you should, you should cover niche in the market with like very few people covering it instead of like Ethereum and like XRP or something. Like, who the hell is clicking XRP videos? I don't know. But yeah, farming content. Because I want to subscribe to more farmers, but there just aren't that many farmers. And like I've shouted out good channels that I see, right? Like, so if you make good content, like, I'll happily shout you out, right? Obviously has to be good to begin with. But let's, let's, let's, let's create more content creators, right? We need more content creators. Okay, let's see.
01:05:13.145 - 01:05:57.643, Speaker A: She had $2,000 on Terra. I feel like that's like the minimum threshold given the fees. I mean, I guess a dollar fee is. It's not too bad. But if I had 2k, I would just probably just deposit here, right? And then do a short form here because that's not that many transactions. And I mean it's still pretty good. The annoying thing about like mirror is like, you do have to like pay like a dollar every time you want to claim those rewards, right? So that's one of the reasons I hope this thing does well like Spectrum Protocol, because this thing is like the one that like auto harvests and auto deposits it for you.
01:05:57.643 - 01:06:17.295, Speaker A: So I don't have to pay fees. I'll have to pay a performance fee probably. But like this, this will be ideal. But I just don't know how safe this thing is. Like, let me know if anyone knows if this is safe. Like, I don't know. I'm pretty sure like projects on Terra are safer than the average project on like bsc, but I just don't feel comfortable doing this yet.
01:06:17.295 - 01:07:20.225, Speaker A: See, I don't think BSC is dead. I don't think BSC will die. I mean, it's just more of a wild west. And I mean if it'll die if like the government like tries to wreck them. But like, I don't really see them dying. I, I don't really cover BSC just because like I'm in the US and like it's technically, I don't think it's legal to like use Binance Smart Chain or at least like the on ramps are blocked, right? Binance doesn't allow me to withdraw from Binance to Binance Smart Chain directly and the Binance bridge doesn't allow for US residents. So given that I'm super doxxed like I'd rather not even, like, risk, like, using Binance Smart Chain.
01:07:20.225 - 01:08:01.821, Speaker A: I know a bunch of YouTubers use it and, like, they're like, full on American and they don't give a fuck and they're probably fine, but that's one of the reasons. And yeah, I think Binance Smart Chain has like, the highest chance of rug, chance of rugby, followed by Polygon, right? Just because, like, it's so cheap and so easy to make these applications. So, like, developers are like, this is more likely to rug. But that's one of the reasons. Let's see. Yeah. Have I checked out Phantom? I literally did a live stream covering Phantom three weeks ago, four weeks ago.
01:08:01.821 - 01:08:40.633, Speaker A: I go over it in pretty in depth. I go over, like, why I don't think it'll succeed for now, right? My general stance on Fantom is that it doesn't have a money market. It doesn't have, like an aave, right? And I think, I think every ecosystem needs, like a safe, trusted, reliable money market to succeed. Because I think that if Polygon did not have aave, like, they would not be where they are now. It's Polygon. The Polygon craze was started by aave and Phantom has cream. But, like, no one is depositing money in the cream just because, like, people see as less safe.
01:08:40.633 - 01:09:33.115, Speaker A: And maybe it is safe, right? Maybe it is safe, but it doesn't matter because the market doesn't think it's safe and the market is not going to put their liquidity on cream. So I just. This is like my thesis and I guess Anchor is kind of like a money market, except that, like, obviously, like, it's not really capital efficient, right? Because I put 7k as collateral and I only feel comfortable taking out this much, right? Just because Luna is so volatile. I mean, look at this, right? If you look at this weekly chart of Luna, it's like, it already dumped so much. How can it go down any. Any further? But like I mentioned, I was recommended this at 25 cents, like, less than a year ago. So think about all the, all the, all the people that like, hold this token and if you put it on log scale, like, holy shit.
01:09:33.115 - 01:09:55.337, Speaker A: Like, literally on January 4th, this thing was like, at 65 cents. So, you know, these people are up so much and like, God damn. Yeah, I was told, Yeah, I was told about Luna at, like, in September, October. I'm pretty upset. But, you know, hindsight is always 50 50. Oh, nice. Oh, my God.
01:09:55.337 - 01:10:11.965, Speaker A: Every time I do a live stream, the markets are up. Damn, it's crazy. It's nice. Yeah. If you. The bitcoin chart off of linear scale weekly just looks so bad. Like, look at this.
01:10:11.965 - 01:10:38.985, Speaker A: It just looks like it burst the bubble burst. I don't know though. I'm not here to speculate. I'm just here to be a humble farmer. Anyways, I literally just talked about Spectrum. I don't know if it's legitimate. I'm waiting.
01:10:38.985 - 01:11:09.767, Speaker A: This is trading view tradingview.com. it's pretty, pretty well known. Let's see if there are any questions. Anyways, I've been going. I've been live for. How long have I been live? Let's see. Oh shit.
01:11:09.767 - 01:11:56.679, Speaker A: I've been going on for pretty long, huh? Okay, 71 minutes. Awesome. Okay, any last questions? I'll probably wrap up the stream soon. Yeah, just ask your questions and hopefully I can answer them. Congrats to the Italians. I'm sure the Brits are pissed. They're probably like.
01:11:56.679 - 01:12:25.975, Speaker A: They're probably like trashing the streets right now. Like they're probably like throwing beer cans like on the street out of. Out of anger. The Brits, they're crazy, man. They're crazy. Am I still bullish on the Matic token? Not particularly. I mean I had a great time farming it in April and May, but I'd rather.
01:12:25.975 - 01:12:59.445, Speaker A: I mean, I'm bullish Matic. The ecosystem, I think it's still a really good place to be in. Excuse me, but I'd rather own stablecoins, Bitcoin or ETH right now. I guess I purchased Luna, so I guess I'd rather own Luna as well. Me personally, like. But yeah, I mean, nothing wrong with Matic. I mean this, I mean Matic, look at this, right? I mean, holy shit.
01:12:59.445 - 01:13:25.685, Speaker A: Look at this up only. Okay, what bridge did I use? Well, go back to. Well, I guess you can rewatch it from the beginning. But I talked about. I converted my stablecoins to ust on Define the. Define exchange on Polygon. D, F, Y, N.
01:13:25.685 - 01:13:54.755, Speaker A: Then I just bridged it. Bridged polygon to Ethereum, then Ethereum to Terra. I paid like a few dollars in transaction fees. So, you know, it's pretty nice right now because gas fees are super low. It's like pretty worth. Anyways, okay, I'm gonna wrap it up. Thanks guys for tuning in.
01:13:54.755 - 01:14:27.477, Speaker A: Thank you. Anyone that watched my live stream over the World cup or, sorry, the Euro, Euro Cup. I guess Italy won, so I'd have to watch the highlights. It's good to be back. Yeah, I'll probably be making Matic content tarot content. And yeah, I guess I'm still kind of out of the loop because I just came back like a few days ago. So, you know, I'm just like sitting comfy on Curve and Terror right now.
01:14:27.477 - 01:14:47.633, Speaker A: And you know, if the markets, if the market sentiment changes, maybe I'll go into Djen Farms. You know, I know a lot of people want me to like do a live stream of like me getting into a Ponzi. I mean that sounds pretty fun. So I'll probably do one. But I mean I don't think this is a marketing addition to do that right now. So. But you know, there, there is always an opportunity and if I get rugged on live stream, then that's really good content.
01:14:47.633 - 01:15:06.705, Speaker A: Right. So thank you guys for watching. Have a good day. Let's see. Yeah. And yeah, let's wait for Arbitrum to launch because I think when Arbitrum goes live, the ETH layer 2 transaction fees are going to be higher. Like a few dollars, I think like one to three dollars or something.
01:15:06.705 - 01:15:27.593, Speaker A: But I mean the liquidity mining programs are going to be insane. So yeah, I'm excited for Polygon. I'm excited for ETH Layer two. Right. Because Optimism is also supposed to launch this month. Right? Optimism, Arbitrum supposed to launch this month and then Terra also good. So you know, there's a lot of opportunities out there.
01:15:27.593 - 01:15:43.325, Speaker A: It's, you know, hopefully I've been a useful resource in for you to you, for you to deploy your capital. I got Luna at 7.5, which doesn't, it doesn't really matter. But anyways, that being said, thank you guys for watching. Have a good one.
