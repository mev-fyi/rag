00:00:00.440 - 00:00:36.286, Speaker A: What's up guys? Taiki here. And in this video I'll be going over Bancor and it's native token BNT. If you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. You know, I look at projects for more of a fundamental basis because one of my greatest fears is selling too early. Whether it be, you know, panic selling after 30% dump and seeing a 20 x afterwards, or even selling right after a two x, feeling like a genius and seeing the token rip ten x. But I feel like by understanding tokens and why a project is valuable, I feel like it's easier to really hold the token and see it play out really to increase your risk reward and maximize roi.
00:00:36.286 - 00:01:05.456, Speaker A: As a reminder, none of this is financial advice and I actually don't own bnt tokens. Rest in peace. But rest assured, I will be buying any sizeable dip. This is the overview of the video. It might be a lengthy one, but I structured it this way just so you can fully understand why Bancor is very, very valuable. First, I'll go over, you know, what it is, what the problems are in this space with regards to amms and how Bancorp solves those problems, and then key takeaways. So Bancorp goes all the way back to 2017.
00:01:05.456 - 00:01:29.512, Speaker A: It was one of the largest icos, raising $150 million until the unicorns came. Right. And then Bancorp just really fell out of favor. You can see this in the price chart. You know, it had this crazy surge in 2018, and then just like, really went into the depths of despair. Until recently, it really surged out of nowhere. And it's, it's garnering a lot of attention.
00:01:29.512 - 00:02:08.130, Speaker A: And the main reason this is happening is because of Bancor V two one, which was released in October 2020. And to really understand Vancouver V two one, you have to first understand what the problems are with automated market makers. So there are two, right? First is the liquidity problem. Second is the impermanence loss problem. I'll be going over both in detail, but let's first look at the liquidity problem. Well, if you think about how current automated market makers work, you know, you can basically take USDC, let's say, and swap it for ETH, right? So if I want 100,000, if I have $100,000 in USDC, I can just swap it on unitswap to get 60 Eth. And I can do that with limited slippage.
00:02:08.130 - 00:02:52.034, Speaker A: Pretty great, right? And there's limited slippage because there's a lot of liquidity for this pair, in particular, 250 million, to be exact. And why this is, is that, you know, liquidity providers, they're incentivized to provide liquidity because they can basically get a share of the fees that the uniswap generates, which is 0.3%. As you can see, in the past 24 hours, this pair generated $200,000. So, you know, if you provide lots of liquidity, you can have a share of the. Of these fees that you generate. But if you think about, like, what happens in the backend of Uniswap for each pool, think of it as like a fishbowl, right? And there's an equal amount of USDC and ETh in it. So with.
00:02:52.034 - 00:03:11.322, Speaker A: With this pair, there's so much liquidity that, you know, if you're trying to buy $100,000 of ETH with USDC, there's not going to be that much price impact. However, if you raise that to a million dollars, there's a 0.8% price impact and $10 million is a 7% impact, a price impact. And this. This is not good for whales. Right. It doesn't really matter for us.
00:03:11.322 - 00:03:41.394, Speaker A: Like, we're never. We're never going to be buying $10 million of E 2D with the USDC. I mean, I hope. I hope I can, but not right now. Right. So these pools are limited in the amount of liquidity it has. So if you look at a more illiquid token like rook illiquid USDC rook pair with $100,000, it's one and a half percent compared to, you know, a really low percent with the USDC ETH pair with a million dollars, it's 13% and $10 million, there's 60% slippage.
00:03:41.394 - 00:04:09.552, Speaker A: Right. So, you know, with smaller tokens, small to mid cap tokens, it's really impossible for big players like whales to buy lots of tokens just because these pairs are very illiquid. So, you know, when asset pairs on amms have low liquidity, the buyer incurs negative price leverage. Not so great. But you might be thinking, you know, what, like, but if. If liquidity providers can earn 0.3% fees by providing liquidity, then why doesn't, like, everyone do it? Like, it just seems like a no brainer.
00:04:09.552 - 00:04:47.906, Speaker A: It's free money. Right? But, you know, the reason that, you know, the liquidity problem exists is because there's a bigger problem with impermanence laws. And this is a pretty complicated topic, so. And I'll try to keep it simple, but there are other videos on YouTube that explain, like, the more technical side of it. But hopefully this overview can give you a better understanding. So basically, in a broad sense, like when you provide liquidity but end up underperforming compared to holding the tokens compared to providing liquidity. So what is this? So let's say there's this pool, right? USD, see EtH, and the price of ETH is 1000.
00:04:47.906 - 00:05:08.742, Speaker A: And the price of USD is a dollar. Yep. And to look, to provide liquidity, I decided to deposit one ETH and 1000 USDC, you know, a one to one ratio. And let's say, you know, this is a really new pool and there's only $10,000.10 ETH and $10,000 USDC. By providing one of one 8th and 1000 USDC, I own 10% of the pool. Cool.
00:05:08.742 - 00:05:20.942, Speaker A: So I get 10% of the fees that this pool generates. Pretty great. But let's say, you know, eth, like, literally goes to the moon, right? Like it's just four x's out of nowhere. Like, I'm super hype, right? Like some. Oh, man. Like, so bullish. So bullish.
00:05:20.942 - 00:06:21.326, Speaker A: But the thing with uniswap and automated market makers is that these pools have to have maintain a one to one ratio of each token, which, you know, which becomes problematic because if ETH moons in value, arbitrage traders comes in and basically dumps a lot of USDC into this pool to take out ETh. Just so you know, this ETh USDC pool remains a one to one balance. So what ends up happening is because the pair, because the ratio must be equal. After the arbitrageurs come in, there's going to be five Ethereum and 20,000 USDC in the liquidity pool. But if you think about it, I originally put in one, eight and 1000 USDC, which corresponded to 10% of the liquidity pool. But now that 10% is only 0.5 ETH and 2000 USDC, which is still great, right? But if you think about it, if I hodled, if I just didn't provide liquidity and just kept it to myself, I would have $5,000.
00:06:21.326 - 00:07:10.280, Speaker A: But because I provide liquidity and this rebalancing happened, I now have $4,000, which is a 20% permanent loss. I underperformed HoDL by 20%, which is obviously a problem because you're just making less money than you would have. Obviously, if you. You're going to make, you would withdraw like $5,000, sorry, $4,000 plus any fees that you generated. But most of the times it's not going to make up for the improvements loss. And this is like a broad generalization of, like, what happens. The more the token moves, the more impermanence loss there's going to be, which is a problem, because if you're bullish ETH and you put liquidity into the pair and ETH, literally ten x's, because it has to be a one to one ratio, it's going to balance out and you're going to own less ETH and own more of the token that moved less.
00:07:10.280 - 00:07:47.836, Speaker A: Not so great. That's the impermanence loss problem. But how does Vancouver v two unsolve this? This, you know, after you understand the problems, it becomes pretty simple to understand why Bancor is great. So Bancor allows for single sided liquidity, right? With unswap and sushi, you have to provide two pairs, like ETH and USDC, or just any two tokens, right? At an equal value. But with Bancor, you can only, you're able to only provide one token on one single side. So this is an example. I currently have my rook staked on Bancor.
00:07:47.836 - 00:08:25.130, Speaker A: And let's see, so I have roughly this much rook on Bancor earning $5 right now in terms of earned in rook tokens. And by providing liquidity, I'm earning around $10 in BNT rewards. Pretty great. And at the bottom right, you see that, you know, if I hold it for 100 days, I get 100% improvements loss. So if there's any impermanence loss that happens, the Bancorp protocol will cover it for me. Well, how does this happen? So this is a graphic of how this happens. So let's, let's assume you're providing liquidity for a token TkN.
00:08:25.130 - 00:09:09.400, Speaker A: And let's assume that for simplicity, the price of TKN is the same as the price of bancor. So let's say I provide 100 tokens, right? Then the protocol will mint 100 bnt and provide it and deposit it into the liquidity pool. And over time, let's say I keep it in there for 100 days. Over time, the protocol will generate fees from all the swaps that the protocol does. And if I withdraw my token, 100 tokens, 100 B and T is burnt, right? So it's not like the protocol is infinitely minting BNT, and like pushing down the price of BNT. No, like BnT is minted when you deposit and BnT is burned when you withdraw. And how it works is that if there's any impermanence loss.
00:09:09.400 - 00:10:14.376, Speaker A: So let's say there's like, tkn goes to the moon, right? The protocol will take, like, whatever fees that they generated over the 100 days from, you know, the TKM B and T pool and other pools, and compensate you, the liquidity provider, for any impermanence loss. So, you know, in the original example, let's say, you know, like this example, if I provide a liquidity on unit swap, I incurred 20% impermanence loss. But if I did it on Bancor, as long as I kept it in there for 100 days, at least the Bancor protocol would cover the 20% improvements loss for me. So I would, if I deposit 100 tokens, no matter what happened to the price, I would get 100 back. That's the beauty of Bancorp v two one, which is really incredible. But also, if you think about it, like, if the protocol is compensating for impermanence loss by you taking its fees, can't they lose money? Like, isn't that a possibility? Like, what if Bancor is just losing money because there's so much impermanence loss that happens on Ethereum? Well, if you take a look at this channel, sorry, this. This graph, it's kind of hard to understand, but if you.
00:10:14.376 - 00:10:49.528, Speaker A: I read more deeply into this, and basically it said that from November 17 to the first week of January, Bancorp paid out $64,000 in impermanence loss insurance. But the protocol during that time generated $560,000 in fees. Right? So, yeah, their bancor is paying people out for impermanence loss, but they're making it up for it in a large way with the fees they generate. Because, you know, if. You know, because we're basically depositing our tokens for 100 days, right? Like, three. That's over three months. That's a long time in the crypto world.
00:10:49.528 - 00:11:42.708, Speaker A: So, over time, you know, the protocol is generating so much fees that it makes up for it, and it benefits both the protocol and the token holder. And I took this from one site and Bancor. It's still really new, right? I mean, the Bancor V two one was introduced in October 2020, but in the past few months, it's already at around a fifth of the revenue, fifth of the fees of sushi, and roughly 8% of the fees on uniswap. But over time, I think this number is going to grow, and it could possibly maybe overtake sushiswap one day. Who knows? And you can see that, like, the total value locked on Bancor has really skyrocketed in the past few weeks in the 1 January. I mean, not much liquidity. But as people caught onto it, I mean, everyone is depositing on Bancor, even myself.
00:11:42.708 - 00:12:11.492, Speaker A: Like, I'm bullish on rook, and I. And I plan to hold it for many months and maybe all of 2021. So instead of just letting it sit there, I might as well just earn a yield on it. And if Bancor can provide impermanence loss protection, it's a no brainer. And, you know, and this is the data to prove it. And this is a tweet by way of that. Just takes a look at the relative valuations of Bancor compared to other Dexs and Ammsdez.
00:12:11.492 - 00:12:51.194, Speaker A: A little outdated, like five days old. But you can see that, you know, Bancor is still undervalued. It's really new. A lot of people are putting money in it. But, you know, there's real possibility for Bancor to be like a liquidity vacuum, right? Why provide liquidity on sushi or uni when you can just provide liquidity on Bancor and get impermanence loss coverage? So, in summary, Bancor provides a liquidity provide lp solution for hodlers. You know, if you're trying to swing trade a token for, like, two weeks, Bancor is not for you. But if you're in crypto for the long run and you intend on holding tokens for over 100 days, just put it on Bancor.
00:12:51.194 - 00:13:21.108, Speaker A: Like, you don't even have to, like, buy another token to provide a liquidity with a one to one ratio, single sided. Single sided liquidity is really, really innovative. And with 100 day impermanence loss insurance, it's gonna basically, the TVL, the total value on Bancor is gonna increase. And, yeah, it really benefits Hodlers. Right. It's not gonna benefit traders. Like, it really benefits people that plan on holding assets for the longer term.
00:13:21.108 - 00:13:49.890, Speaker A: And the token model really generates revenues for the protocol. You would think that they would have to pay out a lot of fee, a lot of. A lot of money for providing insurance for impermanence loss. But as we saw from a few slides ago, they're just making up so much money over the 100 days from the different token pairs. And that's, you know, the main reason that Bancor token, the BNT token, has really risen in value. And I think it's. There's so much room to run.
00:13:49.890 - 00:14:43.236, Speaker A: And I saw this at $5, and as I was, you know, preparing the slides to make this video, which took over a few days, I mean, now it's at around $9, right. I feel the FOMo, but I'm gonna try to wait for the dip, hopefully. And, you know, I guess I wanna, the last takeaway that I want you to have from this video is, I think about, you know, liquidity providing lp. Like a fishbowl, right? Like with uniswap, it's a, and sushi, it's like a one to one ratio of two tokens. And with uni, there's a lot of tiny fishbowls, right? Some are larger than others, but there's a bunch of fishbowls that you can swap tokens from. But with bancor, it's like one giant fishbowl, just because it's a single side liquidity. And the protocol mints bnt on the other side.
00:14:43.236 - 00:15:32.768, Speaker A: It basically allows us to have a much bigger fishbowl with so much liquidity that allows for a little slippage, and with little slippage, you know, yield aggregators, like one inch, like matcha, they might use VNT or Bancor to facilitate swaps, which is only going to generate more fees for the protocol bancor, you know, still relatively new. I mean, they're an old project, but, you know, what they're doing with their new version, v two one, is pretty new, and I don't think the market fully understands it yet. So I think there's a lot of alpha to be had watching this video and really understanding the protocol. You know, I think this, I think bnt can go up a lot more. So, you know, none of this is financial advice, obviously. And, like, I don't even own b and t tokens, so I don't know why I'm showing it. Like, I'm hoping for a dip.
00:15:32.768 - 00:16:20.750, Speaker A: But that's, you know, that's the conclusion of this video. I think Bancor is truly a dark horse in the amm slash Dex space, and I think there's so much potential for it to be a liquidity dark hole and, yeah, liquidity dark hole. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe. Um, you know, this, this video took many days to make. Uh, and, you know, if you can provide any positive, like, like, positive comments and positive reinforcement, like, your support basically incentivizes me to make these videos. And I really enjoy making these videos because, you know, like, formatting, like, making a slide like this, it forces me to understand the project better. And by doing so, you know, if I buy Bancor, like, I'm going to have diamond hands and strong hands with high conviction.
00:16:20.750 - 00:16:23.390, Speaker A: So, yeah, thank you for watching, and have a nice day.
