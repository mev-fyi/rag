00:00:01.080 - 00:00:51.270, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Humble farmer Taiki here, and welcome to this week's edition of Farms of the Week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. And check out the premium discord and lock in the rate before prices go up on February 1. So let's get right into it. I've been talking a lot about airdrop farming on my channel, on Twitter, and I do think that it is a net positive to this space because, you know, I think the majority of my viewers, we've survived the bear market together. We've been in this space for a couple of years, and we're finally seeing, you know, the grass, that the grass is greener on the other side and our coins seem to be finally going up, right. But, you know, if you want to make, I guess, like, significant gains in the crypto markets in the coming bull cycle, you have to empathize with new money, right? You have to empathize with new blood, because where all that new attention goes is where I guess, like, the price appreciation is going to go.
00:00:51.270 - 00:01:54.680, Speaker A: And, you know, the longer you're in crypto, I think it's more likely that you kind of just hold either and stake it and you kind of like, don't touch some of these altcoins because it's like VC coins or it's a scam, etcetera. But also, right, like, if you think about it, what can you do on Ethereum mainnet that's going to make you a significant amount of money right now? Not like, not much if you think about it, right, maybe staking with eigen layer, right? Maybe that gives you some airdrops, sure. But if you think about using defi, using the chain, you know, why would you go on Mainnet when you can just pay lower fees on Cosmos and Celestia, right. That ecosystem, and also try out the solenoid ecosystem. And we have, I mean, we already have like significant success stories. For example, if you stake the one Celestia before the 19 December, you know, you got over $700 of dimension tokens, and you'll probably get more tokens if you stick one Solana with Jitto, you made ten k. Like, I literally know a person that like turned $1,000 into 100k because they just staked Solana with Jito across ten different wallets and each wallet got like over $10,000.
00:01:54.680 - 00:02:18.090, Speaker A: And this is where attention is going to go. And I just dropped this new dashboard. So I've been working on this for a couple months. And, you know, it's, I mean, it's a pretty basic defi dashboard. Let's see how well it loads here. It takes some time, but, you know, stablecoin supply, defi, TVL, I mean, you know, you can get that anywhere. But, you know, I think one thing that's kind of interesting is looking at social metrics.
00:02:18.090 - 00:02:57.242, Speaker A: So I've been, you know, sometimes talking about, hey, like, I've been gaining subscribers over the past couple of months, you know, even though I've like continuously lost subscribers. And you can kind of track this. Okay, this is like kind of bad data here. But for example, let's just look at the three year trend of views amongst defi youtubers. So it's going to be me, Dynamo, Defi, like Patrick and others. And you kind of see that, you know, I mean, the bull market was crazy, right? Look at this. And then we had like a second peak with like the second November of 2021, and then it was down only right? Oh man, it's so painful.
00:02:57.242 - 00:03:36.150, Speaker A: And then recently we're seeing more people come back and watch these videos. And if you've been in the markets for a long time, it might seem like prices are up a lot. But if you look at this, it's like, well, I mean, yeah, we're getting an influx of viewers, but it's nothing compared to last cycle. And if you expected this cycle to be bigger than last cycle, then, I mean, technically you're somewhat early, right? Whoops, I didn't mean to do that. So I'll provide this in the description below. Some aspects are not perfect, so feel free to give me feedback. This is quote unquote beta mode, right? I'm just like sharing this in case it's somewhat useful.
00:03:36.150 - 00:04:00.962, Speaker A: I also have social metrics for YouTube channels and mainstream YouTube channels, like all these big guys. So in case you're interested, feel free to check that out. But let's talk about airdrop farming. So I'll talk first about, I guess, like Celestia, so dimension and also alt layer. So if you staked with eigen layer, you also receive that airdrop. So I mentioned the redistribution is complete. The team continues to say that they're going to launch mainnet very, very soon.
00:04:00.962 - 00:04:57.726, Speaker A: And I do think that this is going to be one of the most anticipated airdrops, at least in the celestia ecosystem. Because if you think about the three, I guess, layers of a blockchain, there's like the modular thesis and then there's a monolithic thesis, and the monolithic thesis is led by Solana, and it's monolithic integrated chains where everything is done on one chain. So consensus, data availability, execution and settlement is all done on one chain. And the modular thesis says, you know what? Like, it's nice to have everything on one chain, but, you know, it's also less decentralized that way. So let's separate out different layers. So we have celestia for data availability, then we have a dimension for settlement, and then all these new applications, specific roll ups can launch on top of both dimension and Celestia and just focus on the execution layer. So the argument is that dimension is going to enables or dimension is to roll apps.
00:04:57.726 - 00:05:48.210, Speaker A: So app specific blockchains, as Ethereum is the ERC 20 nfts. So Ethereum made it really simple to launch new tokens and launch new nfts. And then dimension is trying to do something similar where using the Dimension hub, it'll be really, really easy to deploy new roll apps, as easy as a single smart contract. And if you look at the dimension portal, most of these apps, I mean, they're not real. Conan is a japanese manga character. People are just deploying role apps to get airdrops and whatnot. So I'm not really sure how many real apps we're going to see here, but the speculation is that if you stake Celestia, you get these airdrops, right? But also if you stake dimension, you might receive some airdrops of roll apps that launch.
00:05:48.210 - 00:06:36.528, Speaker A: And dimension actually has a built in Amm, so you can kind of like, you know, swap tokens in and out and the settlement layer actually handles like the transfer of assets and there's a swap fee and the taker fee and all this goes back into buying back the dimension token. So the narrative is, you know, stake Tia for airdrops, stake dimension for more airdrops. And I think this is, you know, staking for airdrops is definitely like the strongest narrative right now. Especially because, you know, staking is a way to lock up supply. So the token is less liquid so it can pump more, right, it can, it can dump more, obviously. But you know, obviously in a bull market it tends to, you know, gravity doesn't really work the way it should and it goes higher. So, you know, I staked a bunch of celestia, I got a bunch of dimension.
00:06:36.528 - 00:07:20.022, Speaker A: I'm probably gonna stake all my dimension, sorry, not all my dimension. So, you know, I'm not really sure what the minimum stake for dimension is for future airdrops. I mean, no one actually knows, but I'll probably stake, you know, ten dime on one wallet, 20 dime on another wallet, 30 dime on a different wallet, 40 dime on, like, all these wallets. So I kind of have, like, you know, different tiers and, you know, whatever I don't stake, I'll keep liquid in case I want to sell. And from an airdrop farming perspective, staking Tia is very illiquid, right? Because if you stake Tia, you have to wait 21 days to unbond if you want to unstake and sell. So if you receive all these airdrops and you don't sell anything, then you're not really realizing any profits. So, you know, from a humble farmers perspective, you have to sell these airdrops at some point.
00:07:20.022 - 00:08:02.238, Speaker A: Otherwise you can be left holding the bag. Because, you know, I've mentioned this before, but I think Tia is going to be an amazing bull market token, but a really, really bad bear market token as soon as people start to unwind their operations. So, you know, if you got the dimension airdrop, make sure to check, you know, I got a roughly ten to 30% boost in my dimension airdrop. So, you know, I already have a pretty, you know, I'm pretty excited for this launch, by the way. Like the dimension staking for airdrop, I mean, I literally made that up, right? I'm just speculating because there's so many roll apps on Testnet, and I'm assuming that some of them, you know, will decide to airdrop, but I don't have any inside information. I'm literally just, you know, pulling it out of my own ass. So just let that be known.
00:08:02.238 - 00:08:31.304, Speaker A: Dimension right now is trading at roughly $4 on Evo. The evo markets have been pretty accurate. I'm pretty surprised by that. I thought dimension would launch at like a dollar or $2, but I think as more people get educated on dimension, I think that dym is going to definitely be the beta to Celestia. So if Celestia does well, then I think dimension does well. That's just my speculation, and we already have strong memes. Like diamond hands, right? Like dymond diamond hands.
00:08:31.304 - 00:09:03.830, Speaker A: That's a strong meme, right. But for full transparency, I will be staking some of my dym. I'll hold some, like, liquid. And if things get too crazy, you know, of course you have to sell, right? Everyone has to sell. So just letting you guys know that. So the next thing I want to talk about is alt. So if you staked, or if you restaked EtH with Eigen layer or staked TIA, you should have been eligible for the Alt airdrop so 13% of the airdrop went to Eigen layer restakers.
00:09:03.830 - 00:09:30.562, Speaker A: So I got 5000 Alt tokens because I restaked with Eigen layer. And then 10% is going to go to Celestia stakers. And the snapshot was taken on January 17. We don't really know what the eligibility for Celestia is going to be just because they haven't really announced it. They said that or last week they said that we're going to announce updates in the coming weeks. So, you know, we're going to get it if you stake Celestia, but we don't know how much. Also, we don't really know what the minimum mistake was.
00:09:30.562 - 00:10:29.272, Speaker A: If you look at, I guess, the Eigen layer restaking points, it was tiered like this where the majority of the people, 22,000 wallets had this many points. So they got some alts tokens. I was in the range, so I got like 5000. And I think anyone over 50,000 got like 6666 or something. I mean, definitely a good stimulus check. And if you think about the role of airdrops, of course, one of them, like, one of the reasons people airdrop is, or teams airdrop is for marketing, right? Like you just give away tokens and then thousands of people have this token and they're just gonna be bullish, right? Because, oh, like they gave me free money, it's so bullish, right? This token is bullish and didn't have a second reason is to bootstrap a community and liquidity. So, you know, I mean, you get the community and then if you give all these people tokens, then some of them are going to decide to LP and then they don't know.
00:10:29.272 - 00:11:38.484, Speaker A: The team doesn't really have to worry about, you know, setting up liquidity because the community will do it. And the third, I guess, is just get a token out, right. If you think about all these tokens, the typical unlock schedule is like a one year cliff, so the team doesn't get their tokens for a year and then there's like a three year vesting period. And if teams think that we're going to enter a bull market, then they should be incentivized to drop tokens ASAP, just so that, you know, in January of next year, they're going to start to get their tokens. If the team waits too long, then their tokens might unlock in a bear market and then they can't really profit off of, I guess, like their dumping, right? So there's many reasons teams Airdrop, I think people over complicate these things and think that, like, team, you know, airdrops are such a capital, like, inefficient way to drop tokens. You know, it's so bad, right? But if you think about the people that say that it's like, people that don't airdrop farm and they're just salty, you know, I honestly think that that's kind of how it works. And I've been doing a lot of work on alt layer just because, I mean, initially, my plan was to, like, just dump this in the first week or two because it's like, okay, I mean, you know, it's called alt, right? That's like a bullish ticker, but they really understand this thing.
00:11:38.484 - 00:11:59.554, Speaker A: Not really, but I. I've been spending more time on it, and I think that if you're bullish dimension, you kind of have to bullish alt as well. But I'm still early in my research process. One example of reasons to be optimistic is there's this project called Babylon. They're also in the cosmos ecosystem. Hopefully. I also staked atoms, so hopefully I get some drops.
00:11:59.554 - 00:13:02.530, Speaker A: But they're basically the Eigen layer for bitcoin. So with Eigen layer, it introduces this concept of restaking, where you can stake your ETH and then restake it. And then other projects can borrow security from Ethereum, Mainnet, and that way, new teams that I guess launch, I guess new roll ups don't have to set up a new validator set, get people to create these validators, and also introduce token inflation. So it's like you're basically borrowing from Ethereum's security. And similarly, Babylon is introducing that on the cosmos hub or in the cosmos ecosystem for bitcoin. So, you know, you can stake your bitcoin, and other projects can borrow security from bitcoin. And it's interesting because if outlayer is working with Eigen layer and Babylon, then we can have all these new, I suppose, roll ups, restaked roll ups that decide to, let's say, borrow security from Ethereum, post their data to celestia, and, you know, kind of have, I think I tweeted about this, actually.
00:13:02.530 - 00:13:37.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So, you know, restaked roll ups, whatever that means. Right. They can use Alt layer to borrow security from Ethereum via eigen layer, and which is similar to consumer chains on the Cosmos hub. For example, neutron borrow security from Atom, and then these new restaked roll ups can post data to Celestia. And I think that's kind of like the idea. So everything, like Celestia is at the base layer of everything, and then teams have the option to, I guess, you know, figure out whether they want to use Eigen da celestia, SDA dimension for settlement, all layer for all these, like, recent roll offs.
00:13:37.330 - 00:14:15.312, Speaker A: And my speculation is that, look, I have no idea what the future holds, okay? But, you know, with the launch of Celestia, it just makes it so much easier for all these teams to just roll up, like, create new roll ups in, like, blockchains. I would just expect there to be a plethora of new tokens, new projects that launch in the coming months. Some of them will go to zero. Some of them will, like, just pump to Valhalla. And hopefully, if you staked Celestia or dimension or even alt, right, maybe you can stake alt for, like, airdrops. I definitely think that's, like, the new meta. I'm not saying it's good, right? It's, you know, there's some ponzonomic elements to it, but it is what it is, and it's.
00:14:15.312 - 00:14:51.688, Speaker A: If this is a new meta, then it makes sense to adjust. So that's kind of cool. And, you know, I do think that the alt layer airdrop to Celestia stakers is going to be really, really worthwhile. And, look, I don't have any incentive information, right? I'm, like, literally just speculating off of publicly available information. If you think about it, 13% of, I guess, the token or the airdrop went to Eigen layer stakers. And Eigen layer has roughly $2 billion in TVL, and this is only going to go up. So $2 billion of, I guess, restakers and, you know, majority of the eth maxis, right.
00:14:51.688 - 00:15:24.400, Speaker A: There's a staking Eigen layer because it's, like, the only thing exciting right now. But 10%, which is less than 13, right? Definitely. But 10% of the airdrop is also going to go to Celestia stakers. But if you think about it, there's $2 billion in Eigen layer, but there's not that much capital and not that many wallets that's staking Celestia. You know, it might seem like there's a bunch of Celestia stakers because, you know, like, that's what everyone talks about. But if you just look at the data and, like, numbers and the amount of capital within these ecosystems, it's a lot less. Celestia just has more mind share because, you know, it's good content, I guess.
00:15:24.400 - 00:15:58.862, Speaker A: So you can check how many. So, I mean, I'll show this in the description below, but you can kind of see how much Tia is being staked. And let's wait for this section here. So I think right now, the market cap of Celestia is roughly two point. Okay, let's say $3 billion, right? $3 billion, roughly circulating market cap. And I know this isn't, like, the best way to do it, but roughly 50% of Celestia is staked. So you can say, okay, maybe like $1.5
00:15:58.862 - 00:16:22.670, Speaker A: billion. Of course, this is not the actual perfect numbers. Like, roughly $1.5 billion is staked. But if you think about it, most of the stakers of Celestia are just VC's. So, I mean, this is one of the reasons to be kind of cautious, because VC's can stake their tokens and then they're receiving, like, 15% APY. But obviously, it really hasn't stopped the token from going up because there's so much demand to do this thing.
00:16:22.670 - 00:16:51.052, Speaker A: So, you know, yes, 50% of T is staked, but most of that is from VC's. So what's, like, the actual number of T's staked by retail? No. Probably, maybe, like, 30%. I mean, I don't have the numbers. I'm sure I can do the math, but I'm too busy right now, so I'm, like, just pulling these things out of my ass. So, like, just bear with me here. And, you know, roughly 33% of wallets stake less than ten Tia, 58% under or between ten to 100, I suppose.
00:16:51.052 - 00:17:29.690, Speaker A: And you can see the distribution here. So, you know, there's a lot of. I mean, there's a lot of angular restakers, but there's not that much tier stakers. I mean, you know, I'm just, like I said, I'm, like, just. This is, like, subjective analysis. But I think that basically, the point is, if you stake Tia before January 17, I think we're gonna get a pretty big airdrop, I guess, compared to regulator restaking, right? I mean, if you staked, like, ten Tia, I wouldn't expect, like, $1,000, right? That's a little too greedy. But, you know, if you staked, like, $200 with Tia and you got, like, $200 worth of alt tokens, then, like, can you really complain? Not really.
00:17:29.690 - 00:17:59.640, Speaker A: And one of the biggest discussions happening right now is, you know, like, are these airdrops? I looted our teams not doing, like, a great job distributing all these tokens. And obviously, right, no one actually knows. People ask me all the time, is it too late? To stake Tia. Look, I literally have no idea, okay? Like, I mean, if I thought it was too late to unstake. Sorry. If I thought that it was too late to stake Tia, then I would be unstaking my tier right now. Right? So the fact that I'm not unstaking my tier makes.
00:17:59.640 - 00:18:41.548, Speaker A: Implies that, you know, I still think that we're relatively early into, like, this. This meta. And also, if you think about it, like, t's staked three months ago, right? So is it, like, three months into mainnet launch? Like, is that too late? I mean, maybe from a price appreciation perspective, but from, like, an airdrop perspective, I don't really think so. And you can also argue that, you know, I staked Tia before all these airdrops happened, right? And you could have said before all these airdrops that, hey, like, Tyche, how do you know that these things are happening? I'd rather stake my tia after some of these airdrops actually, you know, get distributed. And, of course, if you're waiting for confirmation, you have to pay a higher price. I mean, that's just how it works. So do I think it's too late? I have no idea.
00:18:41.548 - 00:19:25.724, Speaker A: But the fact that I'm not on staking implies that I don't think it's too late. And by the way, I'm not really recommending anyone risk that many capital into this. The whole point of Celestia staking and setting up your operation is that it's pretty asymmetric in terms of risk return, where you can just allocate one to 5% of your portfolio and to just staking Celestia across all these wallets, however many wallets you want, and then you just stake and wait, right? Use a stake and show and hope that you get tokens. Who knows? I do think that people are underappreciating this narrative. Even today. I said that. I mean, okay, so I kind of made this speculation because Celestia retweeted starknet's post.
00:19:25.724 - 00:19:33.622, Speaker A: Nick White. John Adler. Right. It's like a build. Whatever. I don't know what this means. And it's like, oh, like, maybe they'll airdrop the ts stickers.
00:19:33.622 - 00:19:56.924, Speaker A: I'm literally making this up. I do a lot of making things up, by the way. You know, like, I just blow post on Twitter, right? That's, like, my. The only utility for Twitter for me is, like, just blow post and ship post, so don't take my tweets that seriously. And they announced, you know, Starknet announced that, you know, we're what is this? Right. Celestia blobstream is coming to start net enabling high throughput, all three. So with Celestia underneath.
00:19:56.924 - 00:20:29.920, Speaker A: So I think what's happening here, I was talking to someone, and they. I think the idea is that, you know, the ethereum scaling roadmap, not that great, right? I mean, you know, they're working on it, but I think, you know, it's kind of losing the narrative. And now they're talking about, like, having l three s. Like, you know, we have l one s and l two s. Why not all three s? And I think. And I think what's happening here is that l three s are going to be app chains that can use Celestia for DA and then starknet for, I think, settlement, more execution. So, I mean, okay, obviously, I'm not that smart.
00:20:29.920 - 00:21:03.078, Speaker A: I'm a mid curve. So, I mean, this literally came out, like, under an hour ago as I'm recording this. So I'm definitely not that educated on the issue. But you're definitely seeing this trend of this modularity, right? Solana is killing it with the monolithic front, and some teams will prefer to build modular and all these modular, I guess, projects. Sure, you can use Eigen dA, right? So Eigen layer will introduce data availability with restaking. Sure. You know, you can borrow security from Ethereum because ETH is more secure.
00:21:03.078 - 00:21:35.600, Speaker A: Right. However, if you don't care about some of these trade offs, then why not use Celestia for DA? And we're just seeing all these projects move away from using Ethereum for DA, but using Celestia for DA. I think this is a huge trend. And, you know, it's definitely not looking great from, like, a narrative perspective from ether. You know, I think if it weren't for, like, the ethereum ETF speculation and the hype, I think, you know, ether is gonna. Ether would be, like, suffering a lot more right now than it is right now. I mean, it's.
00:21:35.600 - 00:22:26.326, Speaker A: It's already suffering, but, yeah, that's kind of my thoughts on it. So next, I will talk about Solana and other high throughput chains. But actually, yeah, let's just talk about that. So let's talk about Solana first. So now people have been complaining, hey, like, tyche, like, you're such a boomer, right? Like, you're stuck in the EVM, right? I have this phrase that I like to say, like, you know, people are trapped in the EVM. And I think, you know, people are just too much of an 8th maxi, and they're too lazy to use non EVM chains. And as a result, all these non EVM chain airdrops is going to be like, omega or, sorry, all these non EVM chains are going to be much less diluted than, I guess, airdrops in the EVM ecosystem.
00:22:26.326 - 00:23:14.326, Speaker A: One example. So I'm actually working on this piece called Schrodinger's airdrop farming, which is kind of dumb, but I just like to have fun sometimes. This isn't public yet. I'm like, literally just like, you know, this is like, my long form ship post, but, you know, I kind of observed there's, like, two different populations in CT or crypto tortoise, right? There's, like, airdrop farmers that's like, euphoric, like, making a bunch of money. And then there's, like, non farmers complaining about, oh, like, I can't believe, you know, Tyche got all these wallets eligible for, you know, airdrops. Like, you know, like, fuck that guy, right? Taiki Maeda sucks, right? It's like those people, and, you know, it's like the second batch people, they tell themselves, hey, airdrops are diluted. I am correct to ignore them and be lazy.
00:23:14.326 - 00:23:39.932, Speaker A: And if you think about the psychographic of the second batch, people, they're never going to airdrop farm. They don't even know what staking is. They just trade coins on a centralized exchange. They don't know what a Kepler wallet is, and they just complain about airdrop farmers and get engagement. That's the second group of people. This is condescending, and I'm generalizing here. Um, and, okay, actually, when I post this full piece, I'll probably have to reword this.
00:23:39.932 - 00:24:51.310, Speaker A: Um, and then Schrodingers are farming, right? This says there are far more people that complain about airdrop farmers than there are airdrop farmers. As a result, people psyop themselves into thinking airdrops are diluted and choose not to farm, which ends up not diluting the same airdrops they complain about, right? So, you know, people love to complain about stuff, right? And people that are also in the same camp as those complainers, they're going to retweet and, like, that type of post, and there's a lot of them, right? So naturally, you know, like, more likes more retweets means that more eyeballs or, you know, that tweet reaches more eyeballs, and as a result, people will get Psyops ed and say that, oh, yeah, like, you know, celestia, it's too late, right? Like, I'm not going to bother with it. But if everyone does that, then the future airdrops are not going to be diluted, right? And then following another big airdrop, we have more people staking Tia. And it's like, oh, like, now it's diluted, right? Now it's diluted, right? It's not worth taking t anymore, because now it's for sure diluted. And another big one happens. It's like, oh, my God, like, what am I doing here? And then it's like, the number of tiger stakes go up, and it's like, okay, now it's dilute night. It's like this virtual virtuous cycle.
00:24:51.310 - 00:25:45.176, Speaker A: And at some point, airdrops will be diluted, right? That's a mathematical fact. But the fact, the thing is, we don't really know when airdrops are going to be diluted until we have a bunch of airdrops happen that end up being, like, super diluted, right? Like, does that make sense? So shorting or airdrop farming is, like, part one is okay. Like, people, like, just complain about things, and then it siles people. And then the second part says that there's no way to know whether an airdrop is being diluted or, like, not diluted. There's, like, no way to know. But, like, how do you know if an airdrop is diluted, right? Like, if you stake $100 worth of Tia or, like, whatever and receive $500, like, was it diluted? I mean, yeah, it could be, because if it weren't for the dilution, it could have been at $1,000 airdrop. And you don't really know when airdrops are diluted until, you know, we're, like, at the later stages of a bull market.
00:25:45.176 - 00:26:23.464, Speaker A: So as a result, I think the most game theory optimal approach, like, the GTO approach, is just that as long as these airdrops continue happening and they're big, the GTO approach is to just stake, because a lot of people, they're trapped in this mid curve mentality of just telling themselves airdrops are diluted. And I am correct to ignore them and be lazy. I mean, that's basically what people are doing, right? They want to not do it. They want to not buy other people's bags. They want to be lazy. And then they reach the conclusion, like a form of confirmation bias where they tell themselves airdrops are diluted. So, you know, this is incomplete.
00:26:23.464 - 00:26:56.638, Speaker A: And maybe people can berate me in the comment section of whatever, right? But I think it's kind of like an interesting thought experiment and like I mentioned, as long as airdrops continue to be big, then it's not diluted. Right. That's a fact. And airdrops can still be diluted and make a bunch of money. Right. So when is it optimal to sell? Like, when is the best time to not enter? We don't know. Right.
00:26:56.638 - 00:27:22.190, Speaker A: There's no way to know. And the only thing we can go off of is the most recent airdrops. So as long as these airdrops are working, then there's no reason to sell. Right. And there's more reasons to, like, just buy in. And it kind of creates, like, this game theory, interesting game theory situation where, like, is it too late? Is it not too late? No. And, you know, I come from, like, a poker background because before crypto, I was playing poker full time.
00:27:22.190 - 00:27:43.052, Speaker A: And it's kind of interesting to think about and, like, this game theory elements kind of, kind of interesting. Kind of interesting. Especially because I also see people with, like, psychological biases. But anyways, this video is going to get way too long. I mean, it's already way too long. So let me try to go through these things these pretty fast. So, Solana airdrops, I think, you know, so schrodingers are drop farming, right? People are like, oh.
00:27:43.052 - 00:28:17.586, Speaker A: Like, people made so much money on jitto, it's not worth farming. But, you know, I think it's worth farming because the majority of the people that say that are going to be eth maxis that are just, you know, sad holding their cucked Eth tokens, and I'm one of them, right? I hold a bunch of eth, and, you know, it is pretty cocked right now. So, you know, I think one airdrop I talk about this last week is drift. I deposited some money into these vaults, and hopefully I get some of these points. I'm clicking the points tab. Okay, let's see here. Yeah, I know.
00:28:17.586 - 00:28:41.456, Speaker A: First point drop, February 2. Cool. And I think you're going to get more points if you trade on the platform. But I'm a bad trader, or I don't want to even attempt trading on chain, to be honest. So I'm just going to enter a capital into these vaults. And these vaults are managed by the drift team, essentially because the drift team, they're professional market makers. It's not perfect, but, you know, that's one Jupiter.
00:28:41.456 - 00:28:58.104, Speaker A: I think Jupiter airdrops can be pretty big. It's gonna happen on the 31st. I don't think I'm eligible because I'm a mid curve. Right. I'm a mid curve, you know, just, you know, angry at myself for missing all these airdrops. But hopefully my redemption arc is, like, t's staking, but I'm farming drift. I'm farming Jupiter.
00:28:58.104 - 00:29:29.592, Speaker A: Or I will farm Jupiter. If they introduce, like, escrow Jupiter into this, then I will, like, farm the hell out of this thing. I know there's other farms that people talk about and, you know, it's impossible for me to cover everything, but I do want. So this is my gift to you. So in the discord, we have this channel called community strategies, where people can submit their own, I guess, airdrop farming strategies or, like, farming strategies. And this guy here was kind enough to talk about his delta neutral strategy. Yeah.
00:29:29.592 - 00:29:58.876, Speaker A: So farming for potential Solana airdrops drift margin by Jupiter Camino while maintaining as little exposure to Solana price action as possible. So I'll provide this video in the description below. I think this, like, does a better job of explaining Solana airdrop farming just because I haven't done it right. So I'm not really an expert when it comes to this. So, you know, I'll show this video in the description and you can kind of get, like, a taste of, I guess, like, the discord and whatnot. Cool. So last thing I want to talk about is, damn markets are green.
00:29:58.876 - 00:30:32.056, Speaker A: Okay? The last thing I want to talk about. Yeah, the last thing I want to talk about is sui adaptos. Because, man, sui is insane. It's absolutely insane. Honestly, I thought that this was, like, a scam chain when it first launched because, like, the whole VC thing. But, I mean, for an asset to go down from, like, a dollar 30 to, like, forty cents and go back up to all time high, I mean, this is objectively bullish. So how can I ignore this, right? I have my biases because it's like, hey, like, I don't like the VC's, right? Fuck the VC's.
00:30:32.056 - 00:30:59.948, Speaker A: But I can't, like, look at this and be like. Like, you can't ignore stuff like this, right? Because, for example, like, say, I think say is one example, right? Say, like, dumped a lot and then pumped to all time highs, essentially. And then, like, this turbo charged, right? So, like, maybe something similar is happening with sui. And it's interesting because if you go to the Sui TV. Let me refresh this. It might be more, actually. Okay.
00:30:59.948 - 00:31:08.000, Speaker A: It kind of decreased a little. Interesting. Oh, wait. No. Okay, there you go. Look at this. This is up only, right? This is literally up only.
00:31:08.000 - 00:31:32.130, Speaker A: And I'll show a few farms. So by the way I haven't deposited capital into any of these things, right? So I have no idea how safe these things are. All I know is that the Sui foundation gave these teams tokens. So, you know, I'm assuming that they've done their due diligence. So it's going to be Navi scallop and aftermath. So let's talk about Navi first because I guess it has the highest TVL. So it's a money market.
00:31:32.130 - 00:31:54.380, Speaker A: And I think they also have their own liquid staking thing called V Sui. And then, you know, if you deposit sui, you can earn 18% because of all these incentives, right? Boosted APR. And all these incentives are coming from the foundation. So these are Sui tokens. USDC, you can bridge there, earn 18%. Bridge USDT, earn 15%. Pretty good.
00:31:54.380 - 00:32:14.820, Speaker A: Hey, pretty good. So that's one. And, you know, you can't technically, like, do the strategies of, like, you know, let's say USDC is collateral borrow USDT and then deposit it here. Right? You can do things like that. I mean, you know, the borrow API is, like, pretty high right now. So, yeah, it's. It's.
00:32:14.820 - 00:32:38.900, Speaker A: I mean, something to be aware of, right? Pretty good. Stable farms, scallop, lend here, let's. Okay. Just these websites, man, it's. Well, if scalp blend does not, does not load, then, you know, sorry, devs, right? I can't show your platform. You know, like, your website sucks. Come on.
00:32:38.900 - 00:32:47.062, Speaker A: Come on. Oh, there. There it is. Okay, there you go. It doesn't really suck. Okay, cool, cool, cool. It's not loading, though.
00:32:47.062 - 00:32:59.090, Speaker A: It's not loading, though. Oh, there. Okay, there it is. Okay, so sui, right? I mean, same thing, right? I mean, there's a. They just have a bunch of sui tokens and there's giving it out. Might as well. And, you know, they have a bridge.
00:32:59.090 - 00:33:20.980, Speaker A: These are wormhole. USDC. Right? People think that wormhole is gonna drop a token, right? Airdrop right? Now knows maybe you can bridge here via wormhole and then get double whammy, right? Farm sui, get airdrops. Cool. There's also aftermath. There's so, you know, they have sui emissions for, like, these pools. Sui, USDC.
00:33:20.980 - 00:33:34.496, Speaker A: I think af Sui is like a liquid staking, right? So it's like, single. Yeah. Like, sui. Sui, sui buck. I think buck is like, the over collateral stable coin. And there's, like, stablecoin lp paying, like, this much. I mean, good stuff.
00:33:34.496 - 00:34:04.074, Speaker A: Good stuff. Definitely. Interesting. And then I'd be disrespecting aptos if I didn't talk about it. Because both Sui and aptos are move based chains. And I guess the narrative around move based chains is that EVM and solidity, there's a bunch of exploits, bridge hacks, protocols being exploited because solidity is not that secure, et cetera. I might be butchering the explanation there, but I.
00:34:04.074 - 00:34:30.399, Speaker A: I think the value prop of move is that it's supposed to be more secure. So look, I have no idea how secure it is, right? I mean, like, what the hell do I know, right? I'm wearing a farmer hat and I'm holding a rake. But, you know, I mean, that's kind of the idea. Aphdos, TVL. Let me refresh here also up only. I mean, maybe most of the TVL are like just the VC's that like, you know, invested in them, right? And they're like just pumping the metrics for the hell of it. But hey, like, can't disrespect.
00:34:30.399 - 00:34:56.211, Speaker A: Can't disrespect it just. I'll talk about a few and Aries, I think. Aries, okay. Yeah, like, Aries, like, this website doesn't load for me for some reason. I got it to load one time and it's similar to like, you know, scallop, right? Where it's like there's this incentivizing borrow lend with Aptos tokens. So sorry, I can't show it to you. Come on, Devs, do.
00:34:56.211 - 00:35:07.610, Speaker A: Come on. Come on, Devs. I'm trying to talk. I'm trying to give you exposure here. It's just like, not working. I think dollar is also somewhat interesting. This is like some defi hub on apdos.
00:35:07.610 - 00:35:41.390, Speaker A: They have an over collateralized stable coin called mod, I believe. I'm not really sure why they call it Mod. I think there's some funky things where you have to vote escrow this thing to get boosted yield. I mean, honestly, like, I don't really know what the hell is going on here, but hey, you know, like, actually this part of the video is probably not that useful, right? I'm literally like a Sui and Aptos noob talking about things that he doesn't really understand. But hey, you know, at least you're aware that TVL is going up. Like, look at that. It's.
00:35:41.390 - 00:35:52.440, Speaker A: Oh, shit. Okay. What the fuck? Okay. Oh, my God. Oh. What? Come on. Defi Loma.
00:35:52.440 - 00:36:21.100, Speaker A: There you go. There you go. Look at that. Boom. Upon bunch of protocols, they were giving away incentives. You know, if you want to be early, you know, like, do you want to be trapped in the EVM? Right? Do you want to be trapped in the EVM? Or do you want to potentially be early in today's VC? VC infested chains? You know, like, sometimes. Sometimes you just have to capitulate and be like, you know what? Maybe the VC's knew something, right? Like, maybe the VC's, you know, like, maybe.
00:36:21.100 - 00:36:34.292, Speaker A: Maybe they knew something and you just have to capitulate. Lastly, Pendle. Gotta respect Pendle. Let me refresh this, because I think it's a little outdated. I think. Oh, whoa, look at that. Half a billion.
00:36:34.292 - 00:37:03.600, Speaker A: I think Pendle is probably, like, the best way to play Eigen lair. Just because there's all these restaked LSD's. They're all commodities, right? Anyone can, like, create them. But, you know, if people restake their ether and they want to earn additional yield, I think the only place they can do that is. Or one of the few places they can do that is like Pendle, they can trade yield. So on arbitrum, right? They have pretty good yield because they have arbitrary incentives. Then you go on Mainnet, and I think they have a bunch of, like, you know, restake the pool paying 26%.
00:37:03.600 - 00:37:47.556, Speaker A: And if you think you have an edge trading in yield, you can trade in and out. I mid curve Pendle, because I think last year, like, q three last year, I was trading yield on pendle just to try it out, and the fees were too high, and it didn't really make sense. I didn't really see it scaling, but I guess what the mid curve part of me missed is that, well, if they continue to grow TVL, then they can accommodate larger size trading, and they can lower fees eventually if they wanted to just focus on that. It seems like it's gonna be a winner when it comes to, like, trading yield and whatnot. And I guess, like, bringing, like, the yield curve on chain. Yield curve on chain, I suppose. Definitely.
00:37:47.556 - 00:38:01.040, Speaker A: Interesting stuff. This video is 40 minutes long. I'm sorry. So long. I'm not gonna edit it, though, because. Yeah, where's my. Where's my alt at? Let's see.
00:38:01.040 - 00:39:08.412, Speaker A: This is crazy. Like, what, what is this? You know, like, sometimes you get airdrop tokens and you have no idea what it does, and then you look into it, and it's like, oh, it kind of sounds legit, but I still don't know what it does. Who knows, right? You know, like, maybe, like, okay, here's my plan. My plan, this is always my plan is like, just hold this thing into Eigen layer, right? Like, whenever maintenance launches, because, you know, eat, eat is very cucked, right? I mean, by, yeah, eat is very cucked and eat maxis understand that they are losing the narrative. So if they're losing a narrative, then what are they going to do, right? They're going to shill the hell out of Eigen lair. That's like, you know, like, that's like one of the few catalysts they have. And if that's going to be the case, right? And you have all the ETH influencers like that invest in diagonal layer, like, you know, in the seed rounds and whatnot, then, you know, they're gonna just make it like, you know, they're gonna do all the podcasts.
00:39:08.412 - 00:39:54.112, Speaker A: They're gonna like, you know, treat it as like the best thing, slice best thing since sliced bread. And then I hopefully, you know, people buy this thing into it and then I can just realize those profits into a USDC or something. Because like I mentioned, if you're airdrop farming, you have to sell at some point, right? I'll be honest. Right? Like, you just have to sell at some point otherwise, because you're staking Tia, which is very liquid, and you know, you can't sell your Tia, right? If you're like, doing this. So if you don't sell your airdrops, then you're never realizing anything. So, you know, just be humble, right? Be humble. Who knows? Maybe this is a tough for alt layer, but I think no, alt layer has a pretty similar relationship with dimension.
00:39:54.112 - 00:40:13.614, Speaker A: And if I'm dimension right then, or if I'm bullish dimension, then I feel like I kind of have to be bullish alt layer. And I guess alt can be like my hedge against dym not doing well and maybe this thing goes to zero. Who knows? But anyways, that's going to be it for me. 40 minutes video. Hopefully you guys enjoyed. See you guys later. Make sure to check out the premium discord prices go up February 1.
00:40:13.614 - 00:40:18.462, Speaker A: If you sign up before then, you get to keep the lower rate. So bye.
