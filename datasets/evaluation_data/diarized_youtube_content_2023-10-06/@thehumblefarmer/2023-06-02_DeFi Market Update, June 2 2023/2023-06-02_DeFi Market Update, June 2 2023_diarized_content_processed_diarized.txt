00:00:01.080 - 00:00:27.656, Speaker A: What is up guys? Taiki here. And today I just wanted to follow up on my last week's video and also give updates to the changes in my portfolio as well as my views on the market. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Link to the premium discord is in the description as well. So let's get right into it then. It's financial advice because hey, you know, like in my last video I got rugged, right? So like, do not take financial advice from me. Yeah.
00:00:27.656 - 00:01:04.862, Speaker A: So let's talk about this, right? So you know, like you might be asking yourself like, hey, like, or asking me like, what are you doing? Like I thought you're the humble farmer. Like this makes no sense and you know, I'll talk about that later. But basically, like how I got into this is like I have a friend, Warren who is like an OG in like the financial markets been you know, like been in the space like for a long time. He was actually like very, very early to the Coca Cola yield farm, Ponzi and you know, he made up like a bunch of money from that. But no, he dm'd me saying, hey, just bought this shit. Pretty sure it's a rug pull. And I'm like, hey, like if Warren's in, like I'm in, right? Like, you know, like, hey, like if Warren's in, like you have to be in.
00:01:04.862 - 00:01:45.690, Speaker A: And then you know, I, I got in somewhere here going to like two, like two x and then just like go to zero. And then you know he was panicking. I was like, oh, like at 80 to this shit coin, it's worthwhile. Like what the hell just happened? Like, I mean this is kind of a meme, right? Because it wasn't actually a rug from like what we know, it was more like an exploit. And they actually like relaunched tokens and now it's trading at like $11. I sold like somewhere like in this red candle because I just couldn't take it anymore, right? I paper handed because, you know, that's what I do. And I got out with like a 10% loss or something, I mean, which is like totally fine, right? And you know, he was like, okay, like it relaunched shitcoins come and go, but losses are forever.
00:01:45.690 - 00:02:26.280, Speaker A: Let's try to be more humble and let's be less degent. So before I talk about probably I, so let's talk about like, you know, I guess like my thoughts on shitcoining, I personally think that, I think shitcoining is okay. I think when it comes to crypto, the hardest thing is to remain engaged and to stay interested. And I can make videos about GMX, ether, and whatever, multi month theses, but it's not really exciting. And I also think it helps if you just have a dj stack in your portfolio, maybe up to 10% of the portfolio, where you keep it liquid. And whenever you see opportunities, just try it out. And that way you have a pulse in the markets.
00:02:26.280 - 00:03:09.826, Speaker A: And there's also this element of gambling and fun and whatnot. My shitcoining this year has actually been okay. Actually, when I say shitcoining, it's not like Pepe or these meme coins. I talk about new launches for gaming or DeFi or whatever, because I think it's gonna go up or something. But generally, generally, general advice, it's not really worth it. Because the one thing that people don't consider with these meme coins is that, sure, it can go up a lot and it can go down a lot, but the hidden cost is gas and slippage mev. And, like, all the fees that you're gonna have to pay and also, like, taxes, right? Because even if you make money, right, you're gonna pay gases, gas fees, like, to sign, you know, like, buy stuff.
00:03:09.826 - 00:03:29.778, Speaker A: You might have to pay bridge fees. Then you have to pay, like, whatever tax bracket you're in. And, like, in generally, it's, like, not really worth it, but, you know, I mean, I guess it's kind of fun. So, I mean, yeah, I don't really talk about shitcoining, like, on this channel because it's. It's kind of. It's kind of weird, but. And I focus on, like, the longer term stuff and, like, more liquid tokens.
00:03:29.778 - 00:03:50.706, Speaker A: But, you know, let's kind of talk about that, right? Portfolio updates. So, yeah, so, taiki, this is what I did. I've been a huge fan of tricrypto for a very long time. If you've been following me, I've been, like, pounding a drum on tricrypto and GLP and why I think it's gonna outperform cash in 2023. And that's. I mean, that's basically played out. But, you know, have the.
00:03:50.706 - 00:04:04.310, Speaker A: As the yields have come down, I figured, hey, like, there's some opportunity cost. I love the position, but hey, I'm bullish. Either NGmx, so let's take it out. Put into either GMX. I also lost some pica. And then I'm doing. I'm shorting, like, the AbAc seed.
00:04:04.310 - 00:04:42.938, Speaker A: I mean, I'll talk, but I mean, yeah, like I've been saying this for quite some time. I think, you know, trekking gop our crypto savings accounts. I think they're going to outperform one year cds or you know, t bills from like, from like today to like, you know, like twelve months from now. And of course, like if prices go higher, like I can't, I can't really say that, but I still generally believe that to be the case. But like keep in mind, right, it's like the crypto savings account. So, you know, if I want to, you know, deplete my savings account to buy something new, then you know, instead of like selling something else or depositing like more fiat, you know, I feel totally comfortable like, you know, taking money from my savings account to buy something I want with it. Right.
00:04:42.938 - 00:05:14.590, Speaker A: I think that's a good mentality to have. And you know, like these positions have become yield generators, income generators. Like, I mean it's printed like I was actually like looking at like how much CRV and CVX I've made from truck crypto on top of the capital gains I've had. And it's like a pretty hefty amount. So, you know, it's something that, you know, you have to kind of appreciate. And these LP tokens are definitely tie. They're like the type of assets where, you know, time in the markets, it beats the time like timing the markets because for altcoins like timing does matter to some extent.
00:05:14.590 - 00:05:43.770, Speaker A: But you know, like with these LP tokens like I don't really care like what the price is. I just like buy earn fees. And you know, if you look at GLP, the price of GLP, it's higher than what it was November of 2021. The picotop because like the fees are like made up for it. But you know, like the fees have come down, right? Tricrypto on convex, on arbitrary paying 10%, you know, GLP paying like nine to 12%. It was like much lower last week. And then like that's one of the reasons I think people like GMX sold off.
00:05:43.770 - 00:06:12.442, Speaker A: But I think that's like a, that was like a viable dip in my opinion. But I'll talk about that later. You know, like, yeah, you know, I didn't think it would go down this much. I mean, actually like I kind of like anticipated this with like the lack of volatility. But like when, when it comes to like buying something like GMX or like any prop text token you can't like, or I mean it's not black and white. Right. But like, you know, like you can't like, like I don't really think it makes sense to like sell GMX because like fees are like very, very low.
00:06:12.442 - 00:06:50.946, Speaker A: Right. Like you can have to be forward looking and anticipate where fees are going to like be like 23456 months from now. Because like that's like, because like the markets aren't like dumb. I mean you can argue that crypto markets are dumb because of meme coins and whatnot, but when it comes to the people that actually move markets and narratives that actually move markets, there has to be some substance behind it. If you want to buy bottoms on defi altcoins for example, then of course the metrics are going to look bad across the board. We have to anticipate what is it going to look like multiple months from now. That's the argument that I've been making.
00:06:50.946 - 00:07:22.502, Speaker A: I think we're near a trough. If you think about the waves, I think we're near a trough in volume in fees case. Then like I feel fine like this, like scaling into GMX right now. I totally understand the argument around Oracle based perp Texas. I actually had dinner with Jordy Alexander a couple days ago and we were like, we're both very bullish perp Texas, but he's more bullish. The central limit order book versions and I'm more like, I personally like these Oracle based ones. I totally understand.
00:07:22.502 - 00:07:49.286, Speaker A: Like it doesn't really scale that well. Like GMX doesn't really scale that well. But I think that's going to change with v two. I think that's going to help. It's going to lower fees, lower latency and whatnot. And I think there's also this aspect of like decentralmit order books. They're like, they're like invested with VC's, right, because VC's just like, you know, fund them and then the token maybe like this less well, but like with these Oracle based ones it's more community based and the fact that it's all on chain allows for more composability.
00:07:49.286 - 00:08:31.438, Speaker A: If you think about like Arbitrum, Defi, basically the only tokens that's done well is GMX and Trader Joe because they actually make money. But there's little ponzis that pop up here and there. But ultimately at the end of the day they just build random vaults on top of GMX and GLP. And I think that creates a liquidity mode for GMX. I'm totally happy to be wrong and I'm totally aware of this scenario where GMX never sees all time highs again. It's something I think about every day because I own so much. But no, I still, I mean, a market's a market, right? I mean, you know, if you think you're right and someone's wrong, like, you can express your view by buying or selling something.
00:08:31.438 - 00:09:13.634, Speaker A: And right now, I'm just scaling into GMX because, yes, the volume of fees have come down, but, you know, I think we're near a trough and I don't really do ta, right. But I mentioned, hey, GMX between 50 and $60 seems like a bunch of demand there, right? And that was like the all time high that couldn't be reached in 2022. And I mean, this is like a screenshot, so I can't really do this. But if you think about like the correct the types of corrections GMX has had, it's typically around, like, I mean, the largest ones are typically like 40% to 45%. And from like $90 to $53, that's like roughly a 45% correction. The largest one was, you know, back in like early 22 when Luna and three AC was collapsing. I mean, GMX saw like a 67% correction.
00:09:13.634 - 00:09:49.008, Speaker A: But also, like, this was when I made like my GMX video, right, back in June of last year. And, you know, like, that was like the Pico bottom, right? And I think there's a reasonable chance that, you know, we're in this bottoming process and in this. I mean, yeah, like I said, I don't really do ti, but it's a ta. But if you look at the relative strength index, RSI, you know, whenever GMX goes to like the 30 level, it's generally been a decent buy. It's only happened like twice before back in June, right? People bought them back in November where they like wicked. And then we actually saw the lowest RSI rating, which was like 27 or something. And that's kind of when I bought more.
00:09:49.008 - 00:10:14.942, Speaker A: I keep buying, but hey, on every dump, I say, okay, it's going to be harder to lower than this. And it still drops. Like Warren, he's been in the markets for many, many decades. He knows this better than anybody. So I have to think about his wisdom, sometimes more than mine. But I still feel comfortable because, hey, if you average down repeatedly, eventually you'll make money. I think Warren's kind of contradicting himself here with these two quotes.
00:10:14.942 - 00:10:35.638, Speaker A: But hey, you know, like, we mean, we continue to meme. So next topic I want to go over is like buying pikachu. So, you know, if you're not aware. Like, look at my damn name. I'm japanese. And, you know, I used to play Pokemon when I was like, very, very little. And when Pikachu dropped its token, I was like, okay, I have to buy, right? It's on the op optimism layer too.
00:10:35.638 - 00:11:01.764, Speaker A: Okay. Like, so there was a token generation event. I did not participate, but I think I got in around forty two cents. And this is something, I mean, yeah, so this is like a less liquid token, but I intend on holding this for multiple months, so I feel fine talking about it. Right? So I actually have a pretty high price target for this. So my price target for Pica is $26. I got this by taking the age of Pikachu and then adding a dollar sign to it.
00:11:01.764 - 00:11:31.872, Speaker A: And if you think about it, it's like, I'm 27 and Pikachu's 26, which is kind of crazy, right? I mean, this is like the reality check. Sometimes it's like, oh, like, wow, like, I'm really old, you know, like, something so cute can also be so old, you know? But I mean, okay, like, in all seriousness, like, that's not really the case. It's not the Pikachu token. It's for Pika protocol. There are. It's similar to, like the gains. Yeah, it's basically like a gains fork.
00:11:31.872 - 00:11:48.792, Speaker A: I mean, not really fork, but it's like a clone. Similar to gains on optimism. They've been around for two years and, you know, no vc's, no token. They haven't had token, but they still a billion dollars in volume for their v three. I think like $1.5 billion in volume. Accumulative.
00:11:48.792 - 00:12:12.270, Speaker A: And I'll share this notes in the description below. But I personally don't spend too much time on this because it's like very low cap and you know, like, you know, there's. Yeah, it's like a micro cap. But metrics have been good. Even without having a token, the builders are relatively well respected. Their discord is hacked. So don't go to the discord or don't click links in the discord.
00:12:12.270 - 00:12:36.320, Speaker A: And like I mentioned, right, like, maybe we're seeing like, perp Dex fatigue and that might dilute the TVL and like, the buy pressure for these Dex tokens. You know, just like be aware of like the bear case for these perp Dex tokens. And, yeah, like, if you like it, check it out. Link will be in the description below. Back to this. So let's talk about my shorting thing. So I've done this before.
00:12:36.320 - 00:13:03.168, Speaker A: I kind of call this like the farmer's hedge or like farmer tikey's hedge, like whatever. And it utilizes aave and also glP. And the idea is you can put something as collateral, borrow avax and then buy GLP with it. GLP is yield bearing assets. It's like roughly 50% stable coins. So effectively, right? Like you borrow Avax and then you buy GOP and it's like half stable coins. So if the markets go lower, then the value of GOP should be higher than the value of my debt.
00:13:03.168 - 00:13:38.960, Speaker A: So if we do see a correction, then I should be able to profit by like take like whatever the delta is. And the added bonus is that I have a bunch of SR GMX that I get to invest. So you can do this with any LP token, right, for Muxlp, truck, crypto, like whatever, you can even borrow something, sell it into cash and then put it into like a stablecoin vault. That's like the ultimate hedge, right? That's like what people think about like when they think about shorting. But this is like a soft hedge, right? It's like a farmer's hedge. It pays the yield. I get like vest GMX tokens and if you look at evacc ratio, it's, it doesn't really inspire that much confidence.
00:13:38.960 - 00:14:40.966, Speaker A: Like, I mean this isn't like, I'm not saying that it's going to be down only, right, it's going to have ups and downs. But I don't really expect all time highs in this ratio. So you know, it's just gotta let things play out just long either. Basically it's like long ether long GMX, like kind of short, like a backs and everything pays a yield, so it's all fine and dandy and you know, like, I feel like maybe this is exciting, but like, I feel like sometimes, like investing is sometimes like supposed to be boring. And you know, there's also like this argument around like, hey, if you're gonna buy altcoins, like why nothing like by the smaller ones? But we started to see like this divergence in tradfi. And I mean this is like mostly due to AI, but I also think like this, there's this element where when the macro conditions are uncertain, people want to buy assets that are perceived lower risk. And those lower risk type of assets might actually command a higher premium because of like the lendingness, the safety net, like the comfortness aspect of it.
00:14:40.966 - 00:15:14.982, Speaker A: So maybe GMX and lido outperforms the smaller prep Texas or smaller liquid staking derivative tokens generally. I've been saying this, I mean, yeah, I said this after FTX, right? It's like this view truck at Doge op is cash or savings positions out from cash. So I just like being invested in 2023. I think it's like a recovery year. And if you look at the weekly chart of bitcoin, it seems like it's bouncing from the 20 week and the 200 week. And typically that's been pretty good times to, you know, be like a holder of VTC. Same can be said for ether.
00:15:14.982 - 00:15:39.496, Speaker A: Like I mentioned, like I sold all my crypto, so I have less. I basically don't have any direct bitcoin exposure. I do a little bit, but like not anything direct. I like indirect exposure via GLP and like whatnot. You know, like, I like ether, right? I think, you know, ether is money. I like using it as collateral. Ether has a higher ltv ratio than bitcoin for money markets.
00:15:39.496 - 00:16:14.060, Speaker A: So that's also like added utility of ether. I also like arbitram into year end with the EIP 4844 proto dank charting with a Cancun upgrade. I just had like a bunch of like buzzwords, right? But basically it's anticipated in Q four, maybe like November, December, but it's going to lower l two transaction fees by ten to 30 x. It's also going to improve the profitability of these l two s because their fees go lower. So I mean, yeah, like the token holder, like doesn't get anything. But I still think that, hey, every ethereum network upgrade leads to some type of pump in some sector. And I think l two tokens are it.
00:16:14.060 - 00:16:40.500, Speaker A: And I like ARp over op. But you know, I still want exposure to the optimism ecosystem because there's base chain by Coinbase that's launching world coin by Sam Altman. They raised a hundred million dollars. They're gonna launch the optimism. Bedrock updates can happen on the 6th. I don't think it's like that big of a deal, but like, who knows? Pikachu is like my exposure to the op market. And I'll wrap up this video with this wise Confucius quote.
00:16:40.500 - 00:17:07.610, Speaker A: If you cannot hold through a 70% dump, then you will never receive a 1000 x pump. Thank you, Confucius. I am no longer confused. And the thing with the market right now is that it's like 99% of the time if you buy something, it's going to go lower. You're never going to be the ultimate bottom because the ultimate bottom, yes, the market's choppy. There's always sellers. But that's kind of why you need conviction and the long run.
00:17:07.610 - 00:17:36.346, Speaker A: Because, like, 99% people in crypto that, like, have a lot of money, like, they're not the. They're not traders, right? Like, there's just people that bought stuff early and, like, just held on and, like, had max conviction for whatever reason. And that's kind of like the person I want to be. And lastly, shout out to base carbon. He's one of my favorite followers on Twitter. Like, all these Confucius and Warren Buffett quotes, right? I did not make them myself. I just copy and pasted it from basically his Twitter.
00:17:36.346 - 00:17:58.070, Speaker A: So props to him. I just saw these Warren Buffett memes and I was like, okay, I need to make a video where I just put, like, ten of these in a single video. So that's kind of like what I did. So thank you guys watching. See you guys next week. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. And if you want more content, I upload three videos a week to my premium discord with daily updates and whatnot.
00:17:58.070 - 00:18:21.766, Speaker A: So if you, if you want to check that out, please check out the link in the description below as well. I should be able to accept crypto payments next week or this week, so I'll talk about that if we get there. Yeah. So right now, like, in the past, I can only accept card payments, but, like, I should be able to accept crypto relatively soon. So hopefully, you know, that appeals to more people. Right. But, you know.
00:18:21.766 - 00:18:22.558, Speaker A: See you guys later. Bye.
