00:00:00.880 - 00:00:23.774, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And in this video I'll be going over why and how I'm giving away this NFT, this gen zero NFT from Defi kingdoms for free. And this NFT currently has a market price of roughly $14,000. So, you know, it's definitely not a chump change. So if you like the content, please like and subscribe and leave a comment in the comment section below. Let's get started. Just a quick little recap on what, you know what Defi Kingdoms is.
00:00:23.774 - 00:00:55.450, Speaker A: Essentially, this is a game, right, built on the harmony blockchain with a decentralized exchange built into it, right? And this is a decentralized exchange. And the farm token, which is called jewel, has in game utility, right? So it's not just going to be like a farm and dump token. And it currently has the highest tbl in all of harmony. So I made a video on this yesterday, so feel free to check that out if you're interested. So let me just go back to this NFT. So let me just go over, like, how I got this, right? Because I didn't pay for this. So the team kind of gave this to me for free.
00:00:55.450 - 00:01:13.238, Speaker A: I'll give you some background. So essentially, back in early September, flu, who is their business development guy, was like spamming me, right? He's like, hey, tyke, notice me. Notice me, buddy. Notice me, please notice me. I just kept ignoring him. And at some point, you know, I kind of felt better. And it was like he, he kind of like wrote me this poem, like, sick bars.
00:01:13.238 - 00:01:26.430, Speaker A: And I'm okay. Like, you know, I'm gonna. I'm gonna hear you out, okay? Just let me, like, tell. Tell me what Defi kingdoms is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I guess, like, my biggest question was like, hey, are you gonna rug me? And he's like, no, I'm not gonna rug you. I'm like, okay, I'll stop farming.
00:01:26.430 - 00:02:01.522, Speaker A: And I guess at the end of the call he just said like, hey, I know you don't take any paid promotions, but can I just give you an NFT? I'm like, okay, I don't take any paid promotions. I'm not a paid show, but I'll take an NFT. Why not? And like, little did I know that this Nft is now worth like $14,000. So let's go back to this NFT, right? It's Kindle crystal sworn. It's earth arctic female. You know it's a gardener, right? Or she's a gardener, right? I'm a farmer. So I can relate with this, you know, I can also relate because she has very low wisdom, very low intelligence, right.
00:02:01.522 - 00:02:14.714, Speaker A: And, like, not that much luck, but it's got a high strength, vitality, dexterity. To be honest. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not an expert, right? It's owned by the humble farmer. I'm not an expert in the NFT space. I'm not an expert in the gaming side of Defi kingdoms.
00:02:14.714 - 00:02:55.084, Speaker A: But, hey, it's worth $14,000. And one of the reasons, or I guess the main reason I'm giving this away is, like I mentioned earlier, like, I'm not a paid show. So, like, the fact that I'm talking about Defi kingdoms on my channel and they gave me this NFT for free, which is worth like, five figures, kind of felt weird for me, right? Like, most of you know, I don't even run ads on my channel, right? Like, zero ad money. So, you know, I don't really make money off of, like, my, you know, my public free YouTube channel. So there's that I. So, you know, to, I guess, eliminate any conflict of interest. I just wanted to just give this away and, you know, make someone's day, right, because $14,000, if you decide, or if, like, the winner decides to sell immediately, is a lot of money.
00:02:55.084 - 00:03:18.716, Speaker A: And maybe, you know, the winner wants to, like, hold onto it or maybe even, like, using the game, right? Because maybe it's worth more in the future, to be honest. Like, it's up to you, like, to the winner to, like, whatever they want to do with it. But that's essentially what I wanted to do. So I guess to verify the price of the price point of this nFt. I'm like, hey, hey, flu. Like, how much is this worth? Is it okay? It's probably $10,000. But is it shiny? Yeah, it's shiny.
00:03:18.716 - 00:03:48.726, Speaker A: And he's like, oh, yeah, 14k easy. Like, no question. Damn shinies are very desirable. So, you know, this is kind of out of my expertise, but apparently shiny nfts are worth 40% more than non chinese nfts. But how do you win this NFT, right? I mean, that's obviously the question, so you don't have to do much. So all I ask is for you to leave a comment in the comment section below saying why you want this NFT. And also, like, show me your favorite project that you think I should know about and why.
00:03:48.726 - 00:04:08.662, Speaker A: Right. I'll be doing a live, a live stream, picking the winner on Friday, right? So look forward to that. And if you don't do these two, I'm not going to pick you. So make sure to think long and hard about why you want this NFT and like, your favorite project. Because I do as much research as I can on a day, on a daily basis. But sometimes, you know, I miss. I miss a few things.
00:04:08.662 - 00:04:20.766, Speaker A: And maybe this is a good way to do some market research on, like, what my viewers are looking into. And you don't even have to be subscribed to me. You don't even have to like this video. In fact, you can dislike this video. It's not gonna hurt your chances. Actually, don't. It's gonna hurt my feelings.
00:04:20.766 - 00:04:55.370, Speaker A: But all I ask you is to fill this out. It'll take like 1 minute. Just your email so I can contact you your YouTube account name so I can verify that you commented on my video, and then answer three simple, you know, just multiple choice questions. Not really a question, but what is your bitcoin allocation? What's your e allocation? What's your alternative? L1 allocation? So this can be solana, phantom, avalanche, Luna, you know, things like that. I just want to see, like, how are my viewers diversified in this current market? Because right now I'm pretty bullish bitcoin. But I feel underexposed to eat right. So I just want to see, like, how the market thinks.
00:04:55.370 - 00:05:15.206, Speaker A: And though this is not going to give, like a. I guess, like, the entire view of the market, maybe it'll help me, like, understand. Okay. Like, people are under allocated to eth or under under allocated to alt o ones. Who knows? So that's literally all you need to do. Just comment below about why you want this and show me your favorite project. Fill this out.
00:05:15.206 - 00:05:35.012, Speaker A: And on Friday, I'll be doing a live stream, picking a random winner. That's it. No hurt feelings. Defi kingdoms team. They're not gonna. They won't be upset if you just get this NFT and sell it immediately. Because, hey, $14,000 is worth a lot, and no one's gonna blame you for cashing out.
00:05:35.012 - 00:05:40.080, Speaker A: So thank you guys for watching. Have a good one. And I look forward to all your comments. Thank you.
