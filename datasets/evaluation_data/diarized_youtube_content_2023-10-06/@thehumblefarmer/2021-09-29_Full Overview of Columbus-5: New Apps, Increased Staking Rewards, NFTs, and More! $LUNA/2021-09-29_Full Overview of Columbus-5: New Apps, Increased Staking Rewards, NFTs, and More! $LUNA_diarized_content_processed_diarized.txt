00:00:00.520 - 00:00:14.130, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. Today I'm very honored to invite back Pete from terabytes onto the channel to discuss Columbus five and all the amazing terabyte protocols that's expected to launch during the rest of the year. So how are you doing, Pete?
00:00:14.470 - 00:00:37.100, Speaker B: Doing great. It's been crazy days. We just had a huge event in New York City where a lot of these protocols gave announcements and really ramped up. There's a little bit of nervousness because it's a major upgrade that brings a lot of important things, but overall, like it's been delayed a couple of times for safety checks and everyone's been running through it and we're on like iteration twelve of the testnet. So people are pretty confident that it's going to go smoothly.
00:00:37.400 - 00:00:42.552, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. Do you know what the price of Luna was when you were first on my channel? Just curious.
00:00:42.696 - 00:00:47.408, Speaker B: Oh man. Um, let's. No idea. Single digits.
00:00:47.544 - 00:00:53.888, Speaker A: Yeah, it was $6. Right? So $6.05 x since Pete was on the channel. So hopefully this is more bullish.
00:00:53.944 - 00:00:56.740, Speaker B: Let's do it again. Let's five x it again.
00:00:57.540 - 00:01:13.240, Speaker A: All right, so because you're like more the terra expert than I am, can you just briefly go over like when is Columbus five? When the Columbus five upgrade is expected? And like what, like should stakers and like Luna lunatic should expect post upgrade?
00:01:13.780 - 00:01:33.770, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Columbus five, this is currently terrorist. Columbus four. So just the next one, right? Next upgrade. Columbus five is scheduled to activate on the night, late night of the 29th or early morning of the 30th. So that's like maybe the day this comes out, right? That's super early Thursday morning where I am in us.
00:01:33.770 - 00:02:08.304, Speaker B: And basically there's gotta be enough validators, there's gotta be enough voting power active after a certain time or it'll roll back to four and we'll try again later. But so as long as everybody's on board and got their validators up and voting correctly and stuff, then that will be the new, the network will continue from then. It brings, it brings a lot of stuff. It makes future upgrades easier. All this technical stuff I won't get into. But like for holders of Luna and for investors and people looking around for opportunities, it increases staking rewards on Luna. We'll talk about that really quick.
00:02:08.304 - 00:02:29.880, Speaker B: And it enables inter blockchain communication. So more cross blockchain protocols. We'll talk about that. And also there are a lot of projects, a lot of tokens, a lot of protocols, a lot of apps that are waiting on Columbus five because they don't want to deploy on the earlier version, so they're going to launch in the next couple of months. So those three main exciting things coming.
00:02:33.340 - 00:02:46.468, Speaker A: Sorry, I was muted. Awesome. Awesome. So speaking of, like, the increased staking awards, can you just briefly go over, like, what that actually means? Like, how much can people expect to earn from the staking Luna on terra station?
00:02:46.644 - 00:03:09.256, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. Go ahead and share screen. I've just created a little demo account here. You could try to trace it, but it'll just go back to an exchange and then you'll need bigger connections to trace it further. So I've seeded in a couple hundred dollars, which will be good for us, to demo all this stuff on the terra station app. You can come in and delegate. You're probably used to this.
00:03:09.256 - 00:03:58.726, Speaker B: If you've done this with other networks, you pick some validators to delegate to, to stake to, and when you do that, you get rewards. Now, they're not listed in here, but currently the delegation rewards are something around. Okay, it's like 4%. Now, that's not amazing, right? But if you have, if you have faith in the future of Luna and you want airdrops and things like that, then that's pretty good. And this is scheduled to go up, I think I would estimate that it's going to triple with Columbus five. And the reason is when I come in here and swap right now and do some swaps on chain, the fees right now to do these swaps are burned. But with Columbus five, those swap fees are going to go to stakers.
00:03:58.726 - 00:04:26.581, Speaker B: That's not going to. There's still going to be a huge amount of burning. That's not going to reduce burning that much, but it is going to increase staking rewards a lot. So as of right now, I think it would go from 4% to 14%. Of course, these numbers always change as more people get in, get out prices move, stuff like that. But in addition, a lot of projects give airdrops to people staking. And if you're a Luna staker, you'll get mirror airdrops and anchor airdrops.
00:04:26.581 - 00:05:10.124, Speaker B: I know you've talked about those protocols. You'll get pylon airdrops right now every week, but then also some projects will launch initial airdrops to Luna stakers to the whole network to say, hey, come check out our protocol. You guys secure the network. Here's a certain percentage of our token supply, right? So you get this free airdrops that you have to come in and claim in order to try out these protocols with real money. But all you did was stake Luna. You didn't buy in and you could sell them or do whatever you want with them. Now, some projects actually run their own validators, so not only can you get the staking rewards, but if you stake to these guys, Neptune or Orion or angel, which I'm not sure where that is in this.
00:05:10.124 - 00:05:40.590, Speaker B: Listen, let's go by this Neptune or Orion or angel, they'll give you tokens for their app because you delegate to them. So we'll talk about Orion in a little bit. If you want Orion tokens and you don't want to buy them, or you can't buy them, then you can stake or vote for the Orion validator and you'll get some Orion tokens. So there's a lot of airdrops involved, but the core staking rewards, which are paid out in Luna and stablecoins expected to triple as Columbus five rolls out.
00:05:41.650 - 00:06:09.370, Speaker A: Yeah, gotcha. That's really exciting because right now all my Luna, I have it bonded on anchor and just like being paid to borrow and stuff. But if these staking rewards go up and if I can, I guess, get additional airdrops on top and it might give anchor a run for their money or, I mean, they're not competing, but it'll allow me to think more openly about, like should I be staking on terra station or should I still be farming anchor tokens, right?
00:06:09.530 - 00:06:37.626, Speaker B: Yeah, of course you guys are familiar with anchor. We'll bridge right into something I think that you can do right now on Anchor, and that's with Apollo, which I know you've mentioned, but there's been some updates since then. So anchor gives you, I mean, it still seems like an absurd concept and it's not going to be this way forever. But you get paid to borrow, right? And that's happens other places too. But you get like, what, 12% to borrow. I know this doesn't seem like a very great percentage, but it's to borrow. Okay.
00:06:37.626 - 00:07:29.634, Speaker B: Usually you pay percentages to borrow and you can put in eth or Luna. And one of the things with Columbus five that's really exciting is it's going to enable a lot more cross blockchain communication. So soon there's going to be bonded Solana, bonded atom, which is cosmos bonded dot, Polkadot and other assets in here as potential collaterals. So if you have Solana and you're sitting on it and you don't know what to do with it, or dot, you don't want to get involved in Polkastarters or whatever, you just want to, then you can come in and borrow against it in anchor protocol soon, which is also like it's going to be more stable because one asset taking a hard hit isn't going to take the protocol down. Right. So exciting things coming up. You can already use all this stuff, multichain with like the terra bridge.
00:07:29.634 - 00:08:19.082, Speaker B: You can send assets around and use them on places on Ethereum like Orion money. You can deposit all these Ethereum stable coins and get anchor earnings, or you can use them on places like binance smart chain, uh, here's planet finance IO where you can farm, um, in all these pools and there's ust and stuff. So you can, you can send coins across on bridges, but that's just going to be improved with Columbus five, uh, to where it's, there's like decentralized interchange like zip your ust over wherever you want. You can zip it over to osmosis and farm there against Adam or, or crow or some other cosmos. You can zip it over to Ethereum or Solana or binance, smart chain or harmony or, or wherever. And apps will start building across the chains. So they're including multiple things in one interface, right.
00:08:19.082 - 00:08:26.350, Speaker B: You don't need to worry about 80 transactions anymore to get where you want to go. You're just going to come in and use the app and be on whatever chains you want.
00:08:26.810 - 00:08:27.330, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:27.410 - 00:09:05.037, Speaker B: So exciting, exciting stuff. But anyway, let's, if you're, unless you have questions, more questions about Columbus five, I do want to show viewers something they could do right now that you mentioned. Yeah. And that is Apollo. You might know anchor, you might know that by borrowing or by providing liquidity you get these anchor tokens and you might know mirror. I'm sure you talked about mirror where you can get these stocks and farm them by providing liquidity. And if you're really into Terra, you might even know pylon, which is like yield redirection.
00:09:05.037 - 00:09:59.980, Speaker B: So the yield you get doesn't just dump back in your wallet, it goes to get into token sales or support creators or dollar cost average into assets, stuff like that. You're paying with opportunity costs rather than just buying stuff. You might know Pylon, but you can actually take any of these assets and put them into Apollo and they will auto compound. So lets say you like anchor and you want to provide liquidity on anchor here, right? Youre getting anchor rewards. You have ank tokens, you want to provide liquidity and get this pretty good Apr 75% here, but you want to make that an APY, right? You see the little note over here, 111%. If you compound it daily, you want to get even better than that. You want to keep compounding all the time.
00:09:59.980 - 00:10:37.190, Speaker B: That's what Apollo does. It's auto compounding vaults. You've probably seen them on other platforms where this Apr of 75% actually becomes an APY of 96% because this is frequently compounding for you. And mine's APr of 109% actually becomes an APy of 166%. Now, for a very limited time, part of this, part of the rewards you get, instead of going back into your pool, are giving you Apollo tokens. This is how Apollo is selling its tokens. You don't go out and buy them.
00:10:37.190 - 00:11:09.740, Speaker B: You can get them at token by putting into these pools. And part, just like 5% of your yield, buys Apollo tokens. So this is called community farming. And until an estimated October 31, I don't know when the exact date is going to be because it depends on how much farming is going on. Until an estimated October 31, they're going to be farming out these Apollo tokens. And again, you don't buy them. The only thing you do is you come in and deposit in one of these vaults.
00:11:09.740 - 00:11:51.368, Speaker B: Maybe you deposit a stock, like a stock liquidity provider. You think that it's really safe to do s and P 500 and ust you think those are safe assets and you're putting them in. You're only getting 16%, but you're probably expecting that the s and P 500 doesn't go to zero. You're not only getting these APIs on these safe assets, you're also getting some Apollo tokens as well through this community farming event. And one of the things that's really exciting about this is how easy it is. You don't have to do 40 things if you have a terra wallet, I'll show you. If you have a terra wallet and I put some Ust in there, you can buy it with a credit card on mirror.
00:11:51.368 - 00:12:24.858, Speaker B: If you're in a jurisdiction that supports that, you can buy it on crypto.com. you buy Luna on cryptocom or whatever, and Kucoin wherever you trade and get it into your terra wallethood, then you could just come in and deposit UST and it handles everything for you. So let's say I want to do auto compounding, anchor ust farming. I don't want to do ten steps. I come in, I'm like, I want $200 worth of this confirm. You might or might not see my screen right now because it popped up the wallet. It'll pop up my little wallet and ask me to enter my password and there you go.
00:12:24.858 - 00:12:43.526, Speaker B: It did it for me. It took the UST. It opted an anchor, it provided liquidity, it staked the liquidity. It did all that in one go. And all I did was give it some UST. And when I want to pull out, you see I have, I mean roughly dollar 200 in the pool right now. Theres a small fee.
00:12:43.526 - 00:13:01.910, Speaker B: I come in and I just withdraw it. And I can withdraw it just as dollars. So I dont have to deal with all this staking and unstaking and providing and withdrawing and selling and stuff. I can just go straight from UST to farming and straight from farming to UST. So pretty cool user experience over at app Apollo farm.
00:13:02.370 - 00:13:16.506, Speaker A: Yeah definitely. It makes things a lot easier. And right now I covered this on my channel too. But I'm farming with a galaxy USC farm. I think that's paying like 35% or something. Okay. Like 27%.
00:13:16.506 - 00:13:38.100, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm just like farming some Apollo and I really like these community farming events. It's like everyone has the chance to farm, you know, it's like, it's not like people are getting in pre sales and whatnot. And I know do Kwon and other VC's were also invested into Apollo. So I just felt a lot safer with Apollo than with other auto compounders in the terra ecosystem.
00:13:40.240 - 00:14:03.730, Speaker B: One of the things to note is early VC's that got into Apollo and made it possible. They got it at your yield is buying it at $0.25, which is, I mean yeah, they got a 40% discount. That's pretty common right. But it's very open and like hey, this is what's going on. And this is still not financial advice and all that. Disclaimers, disclaimers.
00:14:03.730 - 00:14:34.558, Speaker B: This is still like a ridiculously low market cap compared to a lot of financial products we've seen. I don't know the exact numbers but it's something like, let's see here, that would be like a $2.5 million market cap or just a really low market cap for a defi product. And. Yeah, so this is an opportunity. Theres not a lot for sale. You cant come in and drop millions of dollars here.
00:14:34.558 - 00:14:47.810, Speaker B: But this is an opportunity to farm some of these Apollo tokens before they go into ido phase and things like that. They're letting the community get in first before the pots and the whales get in the ideo.
00:14:49.670 - 00:15:10.450, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Apollo's a really cool one. I'm glad that they finally have an auto compounder because like when I was like, you know, farming mirror, I had to like claim it, sell it, et cetera. But if they can do it all for me, then it just makes everything a lot easier. Yeah. What are some other applications that you're really looking forward to post Columbus five?
00:15:12.300 - 00:15:38.440, Speaker B: Some others, yeah, let's, I mean, Orion's going to keep building out. We're going to see some really cool things from Orion. Orion. Let's anchor functionality, work on all these other blockchains. It's already on Ethereum, but there are some that have nothing out yet that I think we still want to chat about. Right. And I'll hit these quickly and just stop me ask questions if you have more questions.
00:15:38.440 - 00:16:05.540, Speaker B: One is white whale and I haven't been paid or compensated by these at all. I don't hold the tokens yet because they're not out yet. So just non disclaimer. There no financial incentive. White whales. For those of you who might not know, this terra is all about stablecoins. I've been using UST for everything because it's designed to make these stable coins that live on any blockchain.
00:16:05.540 - 00:16:54.026, Speaker B: This decentralized stablecoins that banks cant come in and freeze and that are super useful because you can use them for things like 20% interest on anchor and stocks on mirror and LP ing and things like that. White whale comes in and theres already an arbitrage system to keep that UST stablecoin at a dollar and to keep all the other stable coins at where theyre supposed to be at. If the price starts to drift a little bit, there's arbitrage. You can make money in order to bring it back, but that's not really accessible to your average guy. I can't go do that right now. People that want to do that, do that millions of dollars at a time because they're making a cent on each dollar. So they have scripts and they have to interact with the contract directly.
00:16:54.026 - 00:17:33.086, Speaker B: It's not easy. It arguably wouldn't be profitable for most people. Not that profitable. So white whale is coming in and building this project. I know the guys at white Whale, I like them a lot. And they're building this project that you can come in and deposit dollars and those dollars are used automatically to keep the peg and you make money on it because there's these arbitrage actions taken and since there's pools involved and bots involved in war chests and stuff like that, it's more profitable to keep taking all these actions in order. Arbitrage right.
00:17:33.086 - 00:18:27.766, Speaker B: You might get eaten alive by fees if you try to do these tiny arbitrage actions on your own, but not at scale, right? So you come in, you be the whale, not because you suddenly have a lot of money, but because you're kind of joining, you're a piece of a whale, right? You're joining with other people and you're doing this stuff. And there's not just the arbitrage on the peg, but you look over here, there's Luna, be Luna and other things coming in other stable coins. So making money in order to help the ecosystem by keeping, it's like another layer of protection around the stablecoin pig. Every once in a while we see a dip a little bit and you can get insurance and stuff. But still people come out and say, hey, maybe the pig is going to just death spiral someday. They come up with this bank run scenario, multicoin did recently in a paper. And this is another level of protection around that stablecoin pig.
00:18:27.766 - 00:18:47.248, Speaker B: It's so important. They had super cool, just, just a lot of cool things beyond that as well with their war chest ideas. It's something that I really look forward to. And they're not just terra you see down at the bottom. They're looking for Solana and Cosmos as well. I know I said I'd keep it quick, but no, this is super cool.
00:18:47.304 - 00:19:24.824, Speaker A: And I love how like because the most important asset in the terra ecosystem is UST, right? People think it's Luna because it just keeps going up. But at the end of the day, like USC is the most important. And white whale is designed to help keep peg of USD through arbitrage, like burning Luna, minting Luna, et cetera. Orion is looking to bring UST yield cross chain on Ethereum and other chains. I think they offer like 20% on harmony as well. So all these protocols trying to create utility around USD, thats the most important asset. And I mean USD has been up into the right for the past couple of months.
00:19:24.824 - 00:20:05.436, Speaker A: So its definitely been working. And I love how the community just creates all these products to support USD because it is a bold concept, right? Like a decentralized algo stablecoin. When you first hear about it, its kind of hard to wrap your head around. But as you use these applications and as theres so much utility for UST not only on terra but on Solana, harmony, et cetera, you start to see like the dots start to connect, right. And it just starts to make sense. And right now you have Mars, which is like something that I'm the most looking forward to because I'm a money markets guy and I don't know when Mars is coming out. I think sometime this year.
00:20:05.436 - 00:20:10.160, Speaker A: But can you just briefly go over what Mars is and what we can expect?
00:20:11.180 - 00:20:49.928, Speaker B: Sure, yeah. Mars, like you said, money market protocol. There's some distinctions that they've done with how they manage risk and how they manage, how they optimize. When you're doing a money market, you've got to optimize rates in order to have as close to the ideal borrower and depositor balance as you can. You want the system to be in balance because you got people putting in money on one side and people borrowing money on the other. They've made some advancements both looking at other protocols. There's people in Mars who are friends with AavE and compound and love those protocols.
00:20:49.928 - 00:22:04.480, Speaker B: And then also they've got some connections with mathematics guys and Delphi Digital, a group that I really like, and they've come up with another iteration of this balance, like a smart mechanism that pulls the optimization towards where it should be over time. I don't want to get too much into the weeds on that, but that and the governance and things and of course cross chain and using Terra and things like that make it a really cool, theres nothing else here on this page, a really cool money market, multi asset money market protocol. And one of the use cases they actually put out recently, im not sure ill be, I dont want to go to their telegram. Im not sure that Im going to be able to find it right away or should I? Oh, here it is. The idea of leveraged yield farming. Now, if youve been in Ethereum, youre familiar with alpha homorae, then you are familiar with leveraged yield farming. And theyre also doing something called not the Iron bank, the Red bank, which is like cream Finances Iron bank, which was uncollateralized lending to other smart contracts.
00:22:04.480 - 00:23:03.240, Speaker B: Now, if youve really followed Ethereum, you know that there was a hack involving both of these things and $35 million went, poof, right into the hackers wallet. So these are like cutting edge, high risk things and weve got to remember that. But the idea that you can lend out to a smart contract without collateral is really powerful because you can basically, like, it's a smart contract so you can ensure that the contract is going to pay you back, right. It's going to pay the protocol back. And the idea that you could do leverage yield farming so I can come in and have a certain amount of money and yield farm on leverage like I've got more money, more, more power. I've got more yield farming power for my money than I would normally have. And so theres some charts down here in the red paper, which light paper I guess it is, that show you how this would work, how you could leverage and expect more profit and then pay off your debt with that profit and youd just make net profit.
00:23:03.240 - 00:23:43.980, Speaker B: Not to get too much into the weeds, but Im really excited to see how this plays. I know that the guys at Delphi and theyre not owning Mars, but theyre contributors and all the other contributors are really big on UX and things like that. So Im excited see what the interface is going to look like for this. Like come in with $1,000 and yield farm as though you had 2000 right and pay interest in order to do that. I'm excited to see how this UX works because it's something that I think, yeah, could really be cool and I'd certainly take advantage of it, not financial advice. What other questions would you maybe have about Mars?
00:23:45.280 - 00:23:56.152, Speaker A: Do you know what, do you know which assets can be used as collateral on Mars? Like I heard you can use m assets like stocks and like a USC and stuff like. Is that true or.
00:23:56.336 - 00:24:25.338, Speaker B: I'm glad you mentioned that. I'm glad you mentioned that because, yeah, yeah, it's not just ust, but you can use stocks like m assets, which don't have to necessarily just be stocks. There's bitcoin and things like that. But also eventually nebula ETF's will be in here and using AUSD is a really interesting one. You could do that right now. I'll show you really quick with this demo account. Let's say I put in and then I'll explain what it means.
00:24:25.338 - 00:24:54.800, Speaker B: Let's say I've got my terra connected here, I've got dollar 100. I'm going to deposit it in here. Let's give it a little bit more for fees sake. This time I will save my password for an hour. Okay, so I've deposited $100 into anchor. If you don't know how anchor works, 20% might seem absurd, but it makes sense because it uses proof of stake yields on all sorts of chains to do that. So I've got roughly 20% I'm earning.
00:24:54.800 - 00:25:28.318, Speaker B: This is actually like a, if you drop down your anchor here, you see, you have this asset called Austheze. That is my $100 position. It's 90 aust. Why doesn't it match? Because Aust gets more valuable over time. You can always check the price on the dashboard right now it's 110 and it's going to keep going up. So the amount of AUsP I have remains the same, but it gets more valuable if you think through it. That makes sense because it represents my underlying anchor position just like an LP token does.
00:25:28.318 - 00:26:08.062, Speaker B: When you deposit an LP pool you get these tokens and it's some random value, well that represents your share. So now what I can do is I can take this asset which is growing in value because it is this position and I can use this as collateral. Now suddenly im not just using dollars as collateral somewhere, im using a savings account thats growing by 20% per year as collateral. So I can come into mirror now and lets say I want to borrow a stock for some reason. I can short it or I can long it. So I'm going to borrow. Come in and borrow maybe.
00:26:08.062 - 00:26:50.620, Speaker B: I think Tesla is going to do really well and so I want to borrow some of it. I come in and I drop down. I use anchor ust now I'm borrowing and my collateral is growing in value. So even if TESla takes a hit, as long as it's not MOre than Like a 20% hit over a year, I'm still in the black. Tesla PricE could even go down this year and I would still be ahead of the game money wise as long as it didn't go down MOre than 20%. My position is going to get safer and safer over time. I'll borrow, and I've just borrowed some Tesla against that AUsd.
00:26:50.620 - 00:27:20.990, Speaker B: I've got this self yielding collateral now. Notice I'm going to, if I come into my page now, it says I have zero because it's not here anymore. It's, it's staked as collateral and mirror. The anchor team is Aware that this is not ideal. Like it should display here and they're working on that. Okay. Yeah, but on my mirror it says, look, hey, you're, you're borrowing M Tesla and here's your collateral, it's 90 a UST, which is worth this much Ust and this is just going to grow over time.
00:27:20.990 - 00:27:36.460, Speaker B: So it's a really cool option. And you're right, you could do that on Mars as well. Using AUSD as a collateral and some other kind of assets in DeFi is really exciting to have these like self yielding assets you can deploy in other places.
00:27:36.620 - 00:27:55.286, Speaker A: Yeah, and I have like guides on like how to, like if you can go to the farm tab, it'll show like some long farm and short farms. I have tutorials on how to do this too. Like for example, like today, Google, you'll be paid 66% to short Google, and you essentially have to click on that and do the same process Pete just went through.
00:27:55.358 - 00:27:57.198, Speaker B: And you can there too.
00:27:57.334 - 00:28:26.520, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you're interested in how to do that, then I have a whole playlist on the terra ecosystem, so I'll provide a link to that in the description below. So yeah, awesome. Oh yeah. Also, I heard, speaking of, I guess, decentralized exchanges, I've heard good things about astroport. I know the Delphi guys are also super, super bullish on that. So can you go over what actually is it and what we can expect in the coming weeks or months?
00:28:28.500 - 00:29:14.628, Speaker B: It's another one of those places you'll go and you'll notice there's not really just a hero page. It just says, hey, it's a Dex. But it's a little bit more than that because they've taken, again, these they like and know the guys over at curve and places like that, and they figured out how to make a Dex where there are different kinds of pools that are optimized for what the assets are. So it doesn't make sense necessarily. For example, if you have an S and P 500 on one side and, I don't know, pancake on the other side, it doesn't necessarily make sense. It's not necessarily the best to have a 50 50 pool or a stable coin against something in general. Not necessarily the best to have a 50 50 pool.
00:29:14.628 - 00:29:37.376, Speaker B: You can do better. You can have more efficient pools that are not just XyK pools or something like that. You can have all kinds of algorithms. And you see these on curve. You see these various different pools. Well, they figured out how to have a Dex that has multiple pools that are best for the assets involved. And it's going to be across chain, a decentralized exchange.
00:29:37.376 - 00:30:09.430, Speaker B: You can read the lite paper. So there is information out about it at astreport dot medium.com. and that's just, it's really most, I mean, we have an interview with a lead contributor at Astreport that you could check out on the terabytes channel. It's the same with Mars. We recently interviewed Jose Mercado. Jose actually says, Jose Mercado, who is like a lead contributor, a contributor at Mars Protocol, and he talks a lot about the things we just talked about with graphics and everything. So you can go check that out if you're more interested on any of these.
00:30:09.430 - 00:30:39.270, Speaker B: But really excited to have this because we need this stuff. We need a really good amm here, you see that they're talking about pool types, and a lot of factors go into what the best pool types are. And they've done a lot of research on what these best pool types are and how to automate, like, how to pick them. And that's all going to be publicized. It's not public right now. They're still building early stage, all going to be public, all going to be open, and it's going to have the typical governance and drops and things that terra protocols have.
00:30:40.170 - 00:31:12.600, Speaker A: Yeah, this is super cool because I feel like, like, right now, there aren't that many dapps on terra. I mean, like, don't get me wrong. Like, the dapps that are available are amazing. But, like, post Columbus five, you know, they're like, there are teams working on this type of stuff. And I think the only Dex on Terra right now is, like, mirror and, like, terra swap, which, you know, like, it's good, but, you know, like, it could be better. And I think astroport is, like, introducing more capital efficient pools. That'll make things more efficient, right?
00:31:13.620 - 00:31:40.340, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, Terraswap was built as a part of mirror. It was essential, right? I mean, this little trade interface you get on mirror is just a different front end for terraswap. And you can find little gems here. Like, a lot of people don't know that you can provide Luna, be Luna and get, like, 30% right now, um, on that pair. Uh, but it's definitely, like, rudimentary. Um, there's.
00:31:40.340 - 00:32:00.590, Speaker B: I don't want to call it rudimentary. It is. It's rudimentary, right? Um, and it was just built as a part of mirror. And you can feel that. And there's no stats, there's no history, there's no, like, let me find this astroport. I think you'll get excited about this if I can find this astroport. Uh, screenshot they did.
00:32:00.590 - 00:32:30.788, Speaker B: Let's see here. Just to show you, they realized that we're coming in and we're trading on these dexes. Oops. Let's not show all my messages. All right? Can we cut? Do I have them up on everything I do? Yeah, if you notice that. Let me see if there's anything sensitive in here. No, no, this is so ambiguous.
00:32:30.788 - 00:32:41.880, Speaker B: No. Okay, it's fine. I'll close them, but don't worry about it. All right. I did a whole video once where there was a message, like, message. I had to reshoot it.
00:32:43.020 - 00:32:43.840, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:44.780 - 00:33:20.074, Speaker B: Okay, so back to astroport. Let's see. There's a screenshot here that I want to show you. Yes, here it is. They realize that we come into uniswap or Pancakeswap or Terraswap or wherever we're trading, and we don't really have stats on our own personal history and all this stuff involved. You can come in and this is just a little snapshot showing historical apys on pools and things like that, which is currently pretty hard data to get. There's.
00:33:20.074 - 00:33:45.686, Speaker B: There's definitely places that. That are better than others for getting this kind of information. But I mean, this is a, this kind of information, and there's more analytics. You can see. You can blow it up. There's more analytics involved as well, and more like just helping to make you, let you make a more informed and choice on whether to provide liquidity in a pair or not. You know, that that just isn't, isn't present in something like terror swap, right, where it's just swap now.
00:33:45.686 - 00:33:58.730, Speaker B: And I have no idea what I'm getting unless I dive in a lot deeper. So I'm excited to see what Astraport is bringing to the table. They're trying to make things as easy and informative as possible for liquidity providers.
00:33:59.230 - 00:34:04.810, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Thanks for showing us the dashboard. It's really cool. Yeah, I think these tools.
00:34:05.430 - 00:34:09.086, Speaker B: This is a long time ago, relatively. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
00:34:09.198 - 00:34:11.490, Speaker A: I don't know. No worries.
00:34:12.030 - 00:34:17.558, Speaker B: This is a relatively long time ago. I know they have some more stuff coming out soon, so something to keep an eye on.
00:34:17.694 - 00:34:21.370, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, go for it.
00:34:22.270 - 00:34:34.210, Speaker B: Yeah. I can talk about just a couple more projects really quick that are up and coming that viewers might want to keep an eye on. But then we can bridge into something you wanted to talk about as well, which is nfts.
00:34:35.870 - 00:34:40.726, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think you want to talk about Andromeda and Levana, was it?
00:34:40.918 - 00:35:13.330, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. And just. I guess we already talked about osmosis, but osmosis, for those you don't know, is cross chain and Terra is enabling with Columbus five inter blockchain communication. So you come in here, you see that I can deposit in a decentralized way into this, like, hub. I can deposit assets that are from these networks that are plugged into IBC to inter blockchain communication. You might only be familiar with atom and crow, but you might be familiar with some of these as well.
00:35:13.330 - 00:35:30.570, Speaker B: While terra assets will be here and also be farmable against atom, cosmos and other things too on osmosis. So like an inner blockchain Dex farming experience, at least until last report is out. Available at osmosis zone.
00:35:30.950 - 00:36:08.846, Speaker A: Yeah, osmosis is super cool. I've been to like, my viewers are always like, you'll talk about Adam and osmosis and don't worry, I'll have guests on in the future. I like Akash, I like persistence. Like, liquid staking is really cool. And when terra enables IVC and there's UST because I think all the farms are too volatile assets. So it's kind of difficult to provide liquidity. But once UST is on here, then it'll be a lot easier for people to provide liquidity because, for example, akash atom pool people might not feel too comfortable being a liquidity provider for this.
00:36:08.846 - 00:36:27.080, Speaker A: Whereas if it was like Akash UST, then it's more predictable what's going to happen. So I'm going to have youtuber named Cryptocido on sometime soon because he's a super bullish Adam. I'll talk about Adam in the future.
00:36:27.270 - 00:37:01.698, Speaker B: Cool. If you do play around, just remember some pools are 50 50, I've assumed, and gotten, you know, like why? Why did I not put as much in as I thought, you know, it's because the exchange sometimes views like atom is more stable than some of these others. So sometimes you can run and you got to check. Yeah, one of the exciting projects and this is not something you can go and invest in right now. It's just not. It's just something that I thought was super exciting came out of t five alpha. I mean, you go to their site and they have three year plan, right? Is andromeda and andromeda started.
00:37:01.698 - 00:37:24.860, Speaker B: We all thought it was an NFT protocol. We'll get into nfts on terra in a second. There's a lot happening really fast, but we all thought it was an NFT thing. It was kind of unclear what it was. And then at our event last week, they dropped this just amazing demo of what you could do with it. And it was not just NFT collectibles, but it was a. Let me see.
00:37:24.860 - 00:38:09.064, Speaker B: I got to really dive down into the text. Nobody reads here. An application platform layer, a codeless layer using Andromeda digital objects to build things. I don't know if anyone's familiar with the idea of codeless websites. WordPress, I guess, is no code, but you can use bubble to build no code apps and things like that. Andromeda is trying to allow you to build things like defi instruments or NFT collectibles or even custom apps without having to learn to code by building these modules that you can plug in. And let's see.
00:38:09.064 - 00:38:49.292, Speaker B: Look at this. Here's an NFT collectible. You could pick a module for storage, a module for royalties on the NFT, a module for taxes, a module for a signed legal agreement, and all in a no code setup. So you can deploy NFTs, NFT platforms, defi protocols, whatever, by like plugging these modules together. And now I, one of the team members on this thing is, I don't know if that's here, but he's public is one of the guys who developed, helped develop the ERC 721 standard, like the original NFT standard. And we're going to have him on as soon as possible. But it's just an exciting project.
00:38:49.292 - 00:39:41.320, Speaker B: They've already gone through seed series a funding, and you can see they're planning, they're terra native, but they're planning also secret Solana, Cosmos, and then ultimately their own chain for scalability and other reasons. And hopefully at the beginning of the next year, this will be something that is just very interesting for people to deploy stuff without having to code anyway. Nugget. I mean, it's not something you could dive into right now, but something you can look at right now is terra NFTs. And they've started to take off. There's this, like, there's some copycats, like loot, space loot, which is kind of tradable now. You can go into a very early stage, like contract audit is being scheduled.
00:39:41.320 - 00:40:21.278, Speaker B: It's not live yet. Marketplace and trade space loot. I've gotten into space. It's pretty expensive by this point, but we'll see how it settles out. Maybe some games being built on this idea of these spaceships here, similar to loot on Ethereum, and galactic punks, similar to crypto punks on Ethereum as well. And so there's some of these copycats, which might do really well, might not, who knows? I love the art involves, but they're copying, but we're also starting to see some originals. Not just some original cartoony art and stuff like that, but some art collections that are getting more original.
00:40:21.278 - 00:40:35.678, Speaker B: And like, here's a. Tales of terra art is like famous terra moments. You pointed out the mouse cursor here. I didn't notice the mouse cursor. Just as you see, it's a great cursor.
00:40:35.694 - 00:40:36.534, Speaker A: It's a great cursor.
00:40:36.622 - 00:40:47.030, Speaker B: Yeah. So these great, like, terror moments, both positive and negative, like Francis Coppola here saying that, well, that didn't take me where I wanted to go at all.
00:40:47.370 - 00:40:55.070, Speaker A: It essentially captures this. Essentially captures like, the important moments of terror, right?
00:40:55.410 - 00:40:56.190, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:57.450 - 00:41:20.988, Speaker A: With historical significance. So each, I guess, scroll has a tweet or a quote from a person or whatever account, for example, the Luna one. I will get a Luna tattoo at 100 Mike Novogratz, and that's NFT. So if it actually gets to 100, then, you know, you can assume that the Luna community is going to just spam this to Novo and he's going to be forced to get a tattoo. Even if he said this is a.
00:41:21.004 - 00:41:53.616, Speaker B: Joke, I mean, he says he already has the design. I think he expects it. So anyway, not financial advice. Luna, $100. I mean, the, the entire community really has this, like, x number is Fud meme going on? Like $40,000 is FUD. Yeah. This is so just some really early stage, but we're starting to see marketplaces come online and, I mean, NFT interest moves from chain to chain.
00:41:53.616 - 00:42:23.590, Speaker B: If you've been following how nfts have gone, like, like Solana nfts and things like that. So if, I mean, if Solana suddenly starts getting more congested, then it even is, has more issues, maybe like the NFT artists and contributors will go look elsewhere. Will that be Tara? I don't know. I think people tend to think it's like FTM or harmony or something like that, where the attention is going to move next. I don't know. Do you have an opinion on what chains we should be looking for for NFT activity?
00:42:24.250 - 00:43:20.040, Speaker A: I mean, I feel like, I'm not an NFT expert, so I don't want to claim, like, I know anything, but I feel like the majority of the valuable NFTs will be on Ethereum and you're going to have copycats on all chains because people feel like they missed out. And I guess if you're an artist, some artists are just in it for the cash grab, so they'll just tweak something and just launch it on a new chain. I think Phantom FTM ecosystem, I think they recently announced, like, an NFT marketplace and given that their fees are super low, people are super excited about that. But I'm not going to claim that I know anything, but I know some FTm NFT bulls that are looming. And Phantom is also a really good ecosystem. I actually bridged there yesterday, actually, to form on things. Yeah.
00:43:20.040 - 00:43:23.900, Speaker A: Do you have anything else you want to talk about? Or like, is this like.
00:43:23.940 - 00:44:14.004, Speaker B: Well, first I want to kind of ride on that a little bit. Like, yes, I think Ethereum is. Ethereum is the place for NFTs to be right now for sure. But like right now NFTs are kind of doing things that we could do before. Whenever there's a new technology, first we kind of like take the old things and do them again. In the new technology, like the Internet came out and people didn't immediately create Facebook's and Amazons. They created like email, which is basically digital letters and static web pages like digital encyclopedias and buy order, mail order magazine, catalog order sites, the ideas of social networks and YouTube and Amazon and eBay and more recent video sites, social sites, things like that.
00:44:14.004 - 00:44:53.548, Speaker B: They didn't have it for a really long time because first we recreated the old stuff. That's what we're doing with NFTs, taking what art was and making it a little bit better because it's digitally sendable and things like that, and it doesn't degrade whatever, things like that. But we're really just copying art onto nfTs. But NFTs have huge potential in terms of royalties and affecting mechanics and in game items and things like that. And potentially, I don't know, if I knew some of the other potential, I would not be on a podcast. I'd be out trying to build it. Like, if you knew about Amazon early in the Internet, right, you knew that Airbnb was going to be huge.
00:44:53.548 - 00:45:20.622, Speaker B: You'd be trying to make that thing, right. So, yeah, I agree with you. Ethereum is the place for NFTs to be right now in terms of collectibles and all sorts of things. But NFTs might have uses and applications that nobody's thought of. And we've thought of some, like royalties, right? We've thought of some like in betting legal language or taxes or, or other things into gaming. NfTs. Yeah.
00:45:20.622 - 00:45:27.050, Speaker B: And gaming is huge. Like, you could do things like, tyke, you've got a, I don't know, what's, what's a game you like to play?
00:45:27.510 - 00:45:28.606, Speaker A: You might like to play.
00:45:28.718 - 00:45:30.894, Speaker B: Give us a game or just pick a game.
00:45:30.982 - 00:45:31.750, Speaker A: FIFA.
00:45:31.910 - 00:45:49.748, Speaker B: FIFA. All right. You've got a FIFA. Like you're online and you've got a FIFA team and the striker has, like, I don't know, some really sick Nft jersey or, I don't know, a hat. What NFTs would you have in a FIFA? Like, maybe you got a really, like, shoes.
00:45:49.804 - 00:45:52.836, Speaker A: Shoes or thick calves or something.
00:45:52.908 - 00:46:28.930, Speaker B: It might be hard to see, right? Yeah. Okay. So you got something amazing. You've got like an aura. Let's give you an aura. You got this like, golden aura and it's an NFT, and there's only one of them in the game, right? And you're playing amazingly and you're scoring goals and someone that's watching or playing against you, like decides, hey, I got to get me some samoras because those are cool and they go and buy them. You should get a cut of that because you helped make the sale, you know, and so like these game mechanics of like, oh, this guy was in a party with this guy with an axe who did really well, and then he went and bought an axe.
00:46:28.930 - 00:47:26.532, Speaker B: So I'm going to give the original guy a cut. Those kind of mechanics, we're going to see some of that stuff coming in and just making nfts way more than just collectibles. And to that end, I want to talk, the final project I want to talk about is Levana. And the reason this made me think of this is they're doing nfts. I don't know how yet, but they're doing these meter shower drops that are getting auctioned off and they might have dragon eggs in them. And dragon eggs are somehow going to allow people like advantage or governance or access, early access or something on their leverage, any asset platform. I don't know what that's going to be yet, but they're going to figure out how to make these nfts that aren't just pretty rocks, but they actually bring you into an ecosystem or give you something special, some special aspect to this DeFi ecosystem.
00:47:26.532 - 00:47:52.968, Speaker B: Other projects are trying to do this, too, where nfts can power you up on their DeFi platforms or can help you do a certain strategy really well. Maybe it all washes out and it has a negative side, too, so its fair for everyone. But help you with a strategy. Well, on Levona, theyre doing this leverage on the asset thing. Theyll start with a Luna two X token. So if you like where Luna is going, you can get a Luna two X token. And hey, if Luna does well, it does twice as well.
00:47:52.968 - 00:48:41.148, Speaker B: If Luna goes down, it goes twice as far down. But hey, you like it long. You dont want to deal with all these complicated, you dont want to pay rates at perpetuals on Kucorn or whatever you'd use well, you just get the Luna two X token. But they're also working on leveraging any asset, which means they're waiting for Columbus five like everybody else. But eventually they're going to start deploying and you're going to have assets that are just anything you can get a price feed of. So you can bet on weather, sports, or whether the outcomes of elections or something, on leverage. And just suddenly anything that you might predict or bet on becomes an asset that can be traded and used as collateral and so on and so forth in the terra and multi chain ecosystem.
00:48:41.148 - 00:49:22.130, Speaker B: So I don't know all the implications of this. I haven't thought through all of it, but it's yet another exciting protocol that's building. If you research the team on this, the team is pretty stacked and they're just this exciting stuff. It's working in NFTs that are not just creativity and artistry, but potentially have utility and a reason you would want them and a reason they would have resale value in the future. So NFTs are more than just collectibles right now. They're majorly collectibles, but they're going to become in game assets. They're going to become access keys.
00:49:22.130 - 00:49:44.530, Speaker B: They're going to become boosts in protocols and banking and gaming and everything. I used to be major bear on NFTs because I thought, oh, digital rocks back in the day, but now I think they're one of the most exciting things because they're programmable collectibles. Anyway, rant over. Hope you found Levana interesting.
00:49:45.150 - 00:49:45.822, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome.
00:49:45.886 - 00:49:49.170, Speaker B: That's launching this fall, like most of the things we've talked about.
00:49:49.910 - 00:49:58.054, Speaker A: Yeah. And they're also incubated by Delphi Labs. Yeah, Delphi Labs is huge in the terra ecosystem and. Yeah, like super cool guys. Awesome.
00:49:58.102 - 00:50:10.478, Speaker B: Yeah, they also do Stellana and they do, like, they were relatively early in Axios Infinity. So overall, I think some smart guys over at Delphi.
00:50:10.654 - 00:50:32.960, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Well, thank you for introducing all of these new protocols that we can expect to deploy probably like sometime in Q four. Right. And yeah, like Columbus five, I'm super excited for. So I guess to look into the future. What are you most excited for? I guess for the rest of the year as it relates to this terra, or just crypto in general?
00:50:34.140 - 00:51:05.604, Speaker B: Oh, man, hard call. I mean, I see bullish things in bitcoin, I see bullish things in Ethereum. So let's keep it to terra I've named. I mean, obviously I picked protocols that I think are interesting for this video. There are dozens more, and we continue to burn Luna. I'm really excited about where this ecosystem is going. One announcement that was made at our t five alpha event was Alice finance.
00:51:05.772 - 00:51:06.760, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:51:08.540 - 00:51:30.710, Speaker B: This isn't a farming opportunity, but it's something people might want to know about. Alice finance is. I don't know if this is their web address. But they made an announcement that in November, well that's definitely not where I want to go. Viewers don't do that. Don't type in URL's wondering you might get to a spam or like a phishing URL. Right.
00:51:30.710 - 00:51:57.292, Speaker B: But it's Alice Co and they announced that metal debit cards. Metal because that's a long story. Debit cards are coming to the US in November. That's like in a month and change and you can take UST to fiat with no fees and spend it with a debit card.
00:51:57.476 - 00:51:58.468, Speaker A: Thats insane.
00:51:58.644 - 00:52:30.060, Speaker B: And also go other ways and eventually bank transfers. I dont know when thats coming out but just send and receive money throughout Terra and use it in an anchor. Get 20% or get there. You could just keep it in Alice and get, I don't know if this is insured or not but get roughly 10% just on your checking account in Alice and then just go spend it at something. And this has been in the works for a while. People have been super excited about it. It's been very much under the radar.
00:52:30.060 - 00:53:01.072, Speaker B: There's no Alice token. This is not bullish for an Alice token. This is a positive for the Luna and USD ecosystem and for crypto adoption in general. Theyre partnered with a real bank. Theyve been working on regulation and things this whole time, making sure theyre compliant and coming to the US with debit cards in November. So we can spend this funny money without having to buy gift cards or go out through cryptocom or Kucoin or something. Just add a store.
