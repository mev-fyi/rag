00:00:00.160 - 00:00:33.920, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Taiki here. And in this video, I want to explain why I sold the majority of my ETH bags to buy fartcoin. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. And let's get right into it. So it's clear that we are in a bull market. And the question is, how do I want to be allocated to the market to maximize my gains, but to also be able to, you know, mitigate downside? And because I'm new to meme coins, I've hired a few meme coin analysts to do some qualitative and quantitative research and I want to share some of my findings. And there's a lot of findings, but if you strip away all the complexities, right, all the mumbo jumbo that people on Twitter talk about.
00:00:33.920 - 00:01:33.152, Speaker A: At the end of the day, people buy crypto assets for one reason and one reason only. Will there be green dildos? Right? Just think about it. Why did you buy bitcoin for the first time? Because you saw green dodos and you thought you can capture those green dollars. Same can be said for ETH in Salana. Why did I buy defi bags for the past two years? Because I rationalized a reason for why my defi bags are going to produce green dildos. Okay? So at the end of the day, right, you can write an essay, I can write, or I can, I can make like a 50 minute video for why A is going to pump or whatever, right? But at the end of the day, it's whether or not your bags can produce green dildos. What are the odds of green dildos happening for your bags? And then if the green dildo does happen for your bags, what's going to be the magnitude, the size of the green? Dos will be a 6 inch green dildo, a 9 inch green dodo, or a 3 inch green.
00:01:33.152 - 00:02:06.378, Speaker A: You know, you have to take into account all these considerations. And when I sell ETH for Fartcoin, I am not anti eth, okay? I love eth. I love defi, Right? I mean, just look at my channel, right? I love Ethan Defi, right? But it's just a statement like this. There's no, there's no emotions, right? There's no emotions here, right? I am not anti eat. I mean, eat is up 8.2% today. That is a very, very impressive green dildo for everyone, right? People on Twitter are saying, oh, you know, like this is an inevitable rotation that's trans.
00:02:06.378 - 00:02:30.952, Speaker A: Like you can translate that, right? It's like, okay, like, you know, eat is producing a Green dildo. I'm very happy with my purchase, right? That's basically what it means. And you know, on Twitter, people. People are just attacking me, right? This is the founder. The founder of Athena Labs, billions of TVL right, Saying that Tyche is dead. There is no, like, why are people so mad, right? Like, my bags are producing green dildos. Your bags are producing green dildos.
00:02:30.952 - 00:02:45.010, Speaker A: It's not a competition, right? Eth is up 8%. Fart coin is up 13%. Am I going to like. It doesn't matter, right? Everyone's winning. That's the point of the bull market. Everyone's a genius. Everyone owns bags with green dildos.
00:02:45.010 - 00:03:02.818, Speaker A: It's what I mean. Okay, I understand why people are trolling me, right? You know, Guy's a cool guy, right? You know, his name is Guy, so, you know, he. I'm sure he's a chill guy as well. But let's talk about Fart coin. Let's talk about farcoin. Fartcoin. I think it's a chosen one.
00:03:02.818 - 00:03:39.734, Speaker A: Okay, I thought about this long and hard. So obviously, you know, I believe in the AI Meme Coin omega cycle, right? Because within crypto, there's a Meme Coin super cycle, right? And in the stock market, there's an AI super cycle. You combine those two forces and you get an AI Meme Coin omega cycle, right? The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And the problem with AI Meme Coins is that there's a lot of execution risk, right? Yes. These are AI agents, but there's like a human behind it, right? Like tweaking here and there. So you're kind of, you know, you're kind of making a bet on the tech and looking at fartcoin. It's beautiful.
00:03:39.734 - 00:04:22.800, Speaker A: The story is beautiful, right? Truth Terminal chose it as the best meme coin. And somehow, if you go to The CoinGecko Top AI meme coins by market cap, Fart Coin is always there, right? The market thinks this is an AI Meme Coin. It's just Fart coin. Think about it, right? It's just Fart Coin, but people think it's an AI Meme coin. Think how beautiful that is, right? It Fart Coin has larped as an AI Meme Coin to get to the current market cap to achieve the current liquidity, okay? And now. And now that it's like, at a $400 million market cap, it can just be Fart coin. Everyone farts.
00:04:22.800 - 00:05:06.716, Speaker A: Everyone farts. Just think about the green dots, right? Like I said, you buy a coin, you have to ask yourself, will there be green doos? And I thought about this for a very long time. I think Fartcoin is going to continue producing green dildos. Okay? Now, will there be big draw drawdowns? Yeah, of course, right? There's going to be red dildos. It's inevitable. But will the green dildos outweigh the red dildos? Yes. Okay, so when I sell my ETH for Fartcoin, I am not anti eat, okay? 98% of my content on my channel is around the ETH ecosystem.
00:05:06.716 - 00:05:41.702, Speaker A: Okay? I have gotten to this point because of the ETH ecosystem. I'm grateful for Eat. I love Eat Defi. Right? I use it. I mean, I have capital on eat, of course, but will it produce bigger green dodos in FAR coin? Probably not. Probably not. So as a result, after all the work that I've done, I have sold my EID for Fartcoin, right? You have to manifest the green dodos.
00:05:41.702 - 00:05:54.016, Speaker A: Okay? Look at it. Just look at it. Can you imagine your bags doing this? Right? Can you. Can you imagine doing that? Then that's an easy buy. Easy buy. The slam. Hit the buy button.
00:05:54.016 - 00:06:03.776, Speaker A: Hit it. Hit it. Right, Hit the buy button. Now, if your bags are gonna look like this. Flaccid. Don't buy. Don't buy.
00:06:03.776 - 00:06:11.602, Speaker A: Can't. Can't do that. Can't do that. Can't do that. Or you could buy, but no. When to sell. With Meme coins, you definitely need to know when to sell.
00:06:11.602 - 00:06:28.334, Speaker A: Right? But for the time being. Green dildo, right? The weather forecast looks great. Lots of green dildos on the horizon. That's why I bought Nothing against Eth. Nothing against Defi. Okay, feel free to keep trolling me, though. I love this stuff.
00:06:28.334 - 00:06:52.454, Speaker A: Right, Guy, the founder of Athena is dunking on me because his bags. His Athena bags are producing green dildos. Well, guy, let me tell you one thing, right? I also have green dildos. Financial green dildos. Real life green dildos. What do you have a stablecoin Internet bond? No, no. Green dildo.
00:06:52.454 - 00:07:01.478, Speaker A: Green dildo. Right. Green dildo. Green dildo. All right, thank you, guys. I'll see you guys another time. Bye bye.
00:07:01.478 - 00:07:02.510, Speaker A: And happy Thanksgiving, by the way.
