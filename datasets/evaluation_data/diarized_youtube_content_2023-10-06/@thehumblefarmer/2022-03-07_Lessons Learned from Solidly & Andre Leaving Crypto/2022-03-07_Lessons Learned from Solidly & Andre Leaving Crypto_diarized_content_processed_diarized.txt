00:00:01.040 - 00:00:35.332, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And in this video, I'll be discussing the recent news with solidly and I guess more importantly, the announcements that Andre and Anton, they're gonna be, you know, they're gonna stop contributing to the Defi and crypto space and they're gonna be terminating the 25 applications on 3 April of 2022. A lot of people had issues with this, right. Because, you know, they're not actually terminating these applications, right. Like, such as urine and like, multi chain. They're just handing over responsibilities and they're just saying, hey, we're like, we're stressed out. Like, we don't want to work on this anymore.
00:00:35.332 - 00:00:53.020, Speaker A: We're out, right. Like, we'll let, we'll let the community handle it and whatever. And, you know, I'm not going to spend too much time on the implications solidly. Right. Because, you know, I think that project is going to need a lot of time for repair. And I don't think there's like, a poll case in the short term. Maybe.
00:00:53.020 - 00:01:12.120, Speaker A: Maybe in like six months or so. But, like, you know, I'm not. I'm personally not touching that project. I think farming it is okay, though. But, you know, buying a token, definitely dangerous. I'm not gonna spend too much time on that. I was just, like, more focused on, like, I guess, like, human elements of this event, right, of Andre leaving because, you know, he's getting a lot of hate.
00:01:12.120 - 00:02:05.974, Speaker A: Part of that is justified. I think he definitely didn't handle this in the best way. Right, because if he was thinking about leaving, right, because, yeah, if this was a decision that's been coming for a while now, maybe he shouldn't have released solely, right, because maybe he should have predicted that a bunch of uneducated apes will yolo into an unproven project, hoping that it'll pump their bags or something. So there's one. I mean, I get that side, right. But I think it's also important to try to empathize with Andre, because if you've entered the space in like, like late 2021 or something, then you probably don't know who Andre is and, like, the things he has, the things he's had to deal with in the past couple of years. So, you know Michael Kong, right, he clarified this as well as simone, right? He's a CMO of Phantom.
00:02:05.974 - 00:02:28.094, Speaker A: He's a CEO of Phantom. He's like, hey, like, fundamentally, this doesn't really change anything with Phantom, but it definitely hurts the narrative, right. Because part of the. Part of the phantom narrative, right. That the community created was, hey, like, you know, Andre is working on this, right? Andre is a genius. He's gonna work on it, right? It's gonna pump. Right? That's kind of the narrative and similar to solidly, right.
00:02:28.094 - 00:02:42.110, Speaker A: Andre never marketed solidly, right. He was just building it out of his own self interest, right. Because he was curious. Like, okay, like, ve works three. Three kind of works. Let's combine them together. Like, see, let's, you know, let's.
00:02:42.110 - 00:02:55.336, Speaker A: Let's. Let's experiment. The people that marketed it solidly was the community. The community was like, oh, my God, solidly is coming. It's going to pump so hard. Oh, my God. This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
00:02:55.336 - 00:03:19.440, Speaker A: This is going to be a top 30 project or whatever. It was actually the community that created all the hype for solidly. All Andre did was code. Posted a few medium articles that went over solidly, but he never really hyped it up. He was like, okay, I'm building this. Feel free to, you know, put your money if it's interested, right. You know, it's very speculative.
00:03:19.440 - 00:03:49.326, Speaker A: So I think the community also has, you know, community has to, like, look at themselves, right? And maybe it was their fault for, like, essentially tying the fandom chain with Andre, right. Because if Andre leaves, like, you know, if. I mean, Andre left, right? So if Andre leaves, then, you know, like, what is the bullish narrative for Phantom? Obviously there's a bullish narrative, as in, it has high tvL. It's got a bunch of farms, right? It doesn't scale that well. It's centralized. But, you know, it's. It's trying to decentralize over time.
00:03:49.326 - 00:04:11.724, Speaker A: Right. But, you know, it's more, I guess, the issue of the community essentially hyping up this project by themselves. And then when it dumps, the community blames Andre. Right, because he's the dev. The community doesn't blame themselves. They just blame Andre because he created a project. So obviously solid has dumped.
00:04:11.724 - 00:04:25.800, Speaker A: Maybe it's like, bottom. I don't know. It's dumped a lot. Solid x, right? I kind of questioned the fundamentals of solid x in my last video. It's kind of, you know, it's not doing that great. Who knows? Maybe this is the bottom. I'm not touching this.
00:04:25.800 - 00:04:45.264, Speaker A: I think farming it is fine, right? But I'm not touching this. What I do want to spend my time on is Andre's article, right? He wrote two, actually. One right before the March crash of 2020. Right. On February 28. So two years ago, roughly. And one on January of 2021, right? And it's titled building in Defi sucks.
00:04:45.264 - 00:05:26.706, Speaker A: So the first piece, and I'm just sharing this because not that many people know about this, but I do think it's interesting, right. To get his insights and, like, the things he's had to deal with for over two years now, right? Anyways, this. There's nothing, I mean, I'll link this in the description. There's like, nothing too much to highlight, right? Aside from, like, Andre's just posting screenshots of, like, people, like, shitting on him, right? And, you know, essentially, you know, the TLDR, I guess, is that like, you know, Andre creates these products. People notice issues, right. Or people are unhappy with whatever, like, you know, problems that it has, and then they, like, spam Andre and expect him to answer immediately. Right.
00:05:26.706 - 00:05:59.842, Speaker A: And if he doesn't answer immediately, then he's like rugging. Right. Or something, right? Like, oh, my God, Andre doesn't care about the community. He's not answering. Oh, my God, right? And, you know, it's taking a toll on his mental health, right? I'm not gonna, yeah, this. I'm not gonna spend too much time on his article, right? He's just giving examples on, you know, like, the community, like, doesn't appreciate devs, right? The community expects devs to pump their bags, but at the end of the day, the devs are just like doing their best. And obviously not all devs have good intentions, but, you know, like, you know, Andre's trying, right? He's definitely trying, right, to.
00:05:59.842 - 00:06:31.148, Speaker A: To push the industry forward. And then, you know, this article, I want to spend more time on building defi sucks, part two, right? So it's roughly a year has passed since 2020. You know, like, the bags are actually pumping, right? Like January 2021. Like, you could like, buy anything and it would like pump like three x. It was, it was actually insane. And I just want to share this, right? Not only for Andre's sake, but I guess for the sake of, I guess, builders in crypto in general. And I guess this also applies to influencers too, right? Influencers and developers.
00:06:31.148 - 00:07:02.270, Speaker A: I think developers have it much harder than influencers, obviously, but it's like the similar concept. So first of all, development takes time much longer than even you as a developer think it will. Nine out of ten ideas will fail. You can spend months or years building something that conceptually you thought would take weeks, but it takes a long time. It's part of the process. It can be demotivating. And then as you're working on something, add hundreds and thousands of people spamming you on telegram, discord, Twitter, when release, when launch.
00:07:02.270 - 00:08:07.842, Speaker A: Why hasn't it come out? Why number go down? Where's the update? Do you even care about us? Are you going to rug stuff like that? Developers, their job is to developer. They're not necessarily the best marketers, communicators, you know, like, it is what it is, right? And I feel like the community, the crypto community, expects developers to just be superhuman and like, you know, build things that like pump, right? But you know, no matter how hard devs try, sometimes it just doesn't pump, right? There's, there's no product market fit, but that's part of the experimentation that's take that's gotten crypto this far. But anyways, let's keep going. As developers, our work is incredibly public. More eyes, more peer review, faster development. But if you make mistakes, it's used as ammunition against you, right? If you make one mistake, then it's going to be used against you forever. And, you know, weeks and months after they've been rectified, your delays are seen as incompetence and your failures are amplified tenfold, right? So, you know, he's been building in this space for many, many years.
00:08:07.842 - 00:08:59.484, Speaker A: And, you know, like, this adds up, right? It takes a mental toll, right? Like, you know, like no one, like, if you're like some dj and ape that like, entered a space like October 2021, like, you have no. Who I like, you have no idea who Andre is, right? You just expect him to like make good stuff that pumps, right? And when it doesn't pump, then, like, it's like, oh, Andre rugged, right? Andre is a scammer, right? Anyways, real users are scarce. If you strip away the subsidies, right? Like the incentives and like tokenomics, the number collapses, right? Most products in defi, they're not that great. So if you take away the token aspect, then there's gonna be like significantly less users. People don't care about how you build things. They just want to form your tokens. People don't care that, you know, like all the technical specificalities that like, make the technology interesting, you know, they just want the token value to go up.
00:08:59.484 - 00:09:20.558, Speaker A: People don't care that you manage to have your gas costs. It doesn't help their net worth grow. Your value is only as good as your token. Token go up. You've built an amazing protocol, great community, you're a genius. It's a future finance token goes down, you're a scammer. Fake project, bad coder rug, yada yada yada, right? And Andre often experiments with many, many ideas and, you know, most ideas, I think.
00:09:20.558 - 00:10:11.106, Speaker A: I guess, like, you know, urine went up a lot, right? And he, like, made a name for himself with urine. But, you know, urine was an experiment. And whatever, like, products he's released after urine, you know, they're also experiments, but, you know, there's always people that buy the top, and those, those top buyers, right? Those reply guys, you know, they really, you know, they really come at him, right? They really, they really go at him. And this is also, like, I think this medium is, like, a message to, like, developers, right? And kind of warning them that, like, hey, if you're going to build in defi or crypto, like, you have to, you know, you have to have a strong, strong mind, right? You have that thick skin. And one of the things that, like, you know, made Andre, I guess, like, you know, that gave him the godfather status was because, you know, he created Wi fi, and he essentially gave away the tokens, right? It was kind of like the fair launch. He didn't. I mean, it was.
00:10:11.106 - 00:10:36.724, Speaker A: Anyone could farm it, right? And I think he farmed some himself. But, you know, he. The team got zero tokens, 0%, like, 0% of that allocation. And, you know, the community was able to farm it. And the reason he did he did that was because he didn't want to deal with, like, the community, right? He's self aware. He's self aware enough to know that, okay, like, I like, I like building. I think I'm a good developer, but I'm not really good with, like, managing the community.
00:10:36.724 - 00:11:18.810, Speaker A: So if I just create a good product and give away the tokens, then maybe I don't have to deal with all the B's. But, you know, even though he hasn't worked on this product in over a year, he still gets blamed for Wi Fi going down, right? Like, he doesn't work on urine anymore, right? But everyone, everyone thinks of urine as, like, the Andre project. And whenever things go up, whenever things go down, it's like, yep, Andre, right? He's dumping on you, which makes no sense. And also, like, yeah, even with the tokens, he's farmed with Wifi, the development costs with KP three r, he's not even in the green, right? So people call him, like, oh, yeah. Like, he's dumped on us, and, like, he's made enough money. Now he's, like, leaving the space. Well, that's not really the case, right? I mean.
00:11:18.810 - 00:11:49.796, Speaker A: I mean, I'm sure he's made a lot of money, like, investing in, like, bitcoin and need and, like, you know, like phantom and stuff. But, you know, he's like, he's not really dumping, like, wi fi on me, right? Like, he. He has to, like, spend money, like, to, like, hire and, like, work with people and, you know, it's. He's actually in the red, or at least he's claiming to be in the red. Community is bullshit, you know, and he's really just, he's just going at it, right? He's just like, yeah, like, this sucks. And, you know, you can kind of feel. Feel like the change in tone, right? I mean, this was a.
00:11:49.796 - 00:12:15.470, Speaker A: This is February of 2020 and then this is January of 2021, right? So imagine how he feels in, like, march of 2022, right? Especially when, like, price is going down. Community, right? They don't care about your protocol. They don't care about you. And, you know, they'll just sell the token when they think they're no longer. When they think that you are no longer contributing enough by their standards. It's not their fault. It's your fault.
00:12:15.470 - 00:13:13.126, Speaker A: They're not going to try to add value, right? They're not going to share their ideas, right? Like, you know, like, suggestions on, like, how to improve the protocol, right? They just invest and then, you know, expect number to go up. And if number goes down, then they just, like, you know, say the devs are rugging, right? That's kind of how the crypto community acts now these days. Yeah, but they'll spend endless hours of your time asking for updates, clarifications and, you know, etc, right? Governance, community, kill innovation and development. Don't do it. You know, it's kind of similar to how, like how I personally think that dows. I don't think daos have, like, that much value, right? I'd rather bet on, like, a smart team working on something rather than like a thousand bag holders, like, figuring out, like, what's gonna pump their bags in the immediate term, right? You can kind of see this in, like, the Wonderland governance proposals, right? You know, it's like daos don't work. Best advice from him to wrap up the article.
00:13:13.126 - 00:13:44.756, Speaker A: Don't be a dev. You need to be some sick kind of masochist to be a dev in this space. He suggests that you should rather be like, a shitcoin trader, right? You can meme and shit, post all day long in telegram and Twitter, and you can harass development team for updates if you happen to guess right and your shitcoin goes up, you get to claim all the clout. If it goes down, you get to blame the project. You'll make significantly more money. And even if your call was wrong, you can just claim it with psyops to get someone to liquidate you. Why do you want to tougher all the costs, all the responsibility, and all the risks without a fraction of the reward, right? So, you know, this was.
00:13:44.756 - 00:14:19.920, Speaker A: When was this? This was like, what, 15 months ago? Yeah, 15 months ago. And, you know, I think it's. I think he's reached a tipping point, right? And he's like, yep, like, I'm out. I'm out. So, you know, like, I mean, like, I'm not gonna lie, right? I mean, I definitely think that he could have communicated the whole solidly thing better, right? But, you know, he's human, right? He's human. And it wasn't his fault that solidly was overhyped. It was because the community made it overhyped.
00:14:19.920 - 00:14:51.964, Speaker A: Right. And that's partly blame to the community. But, you know, it's a lot easier to blame Andre than the community, right? Like, let's say there's, like, a thousand people on Twitter and YouTube, like, pumping solidly, right? It's like, oh, my God, buy this thing. It's so good, right? Like, you can't really, like, how do you blame those people, right? I mean, it's like a collective group that, like, got wrecked or something, right? You know? Like, it's. It's much easier to find a scapegoat, which is Andre. And Andre is not perfect, right? He's human. You know, he's.
00:14:51.964 - 00:15:27.856, Speaker A: He's just a developer, right? He's just one single person. Um, but, you know, be nice to people. I think that's the lesson, right? Be nice to people, right? Like, everyone's just trying their best, right? And not everyone has, like, the best intentions, but Andre, I don't think Andre had bad intentions, right? Like, he's been in this space for. For many years, right? He's, you know, like, that's what it is. So I think in terms of, like, markets, what are the lessons to be learned here? And I'm not going to spend too much time with Hololi. Like I said, you know, that that project has a long ways to go. Let's just say that.
00:15:27.856 - 00:16:33.860, Speaker A: But, you know, lessons from solid league, obviously not financial advice. And I think the biggest lesson that I think you can take away from this, that you can apply to your trading or whatever, or, like, investing or whatever, is the concept of, like, you know, just something being overhyped. And, you know, just, I guess, like, the overall, like, defi markets just in like a bearish phase, right? So there's like, no new capital flowing in the crypto, right? So if everyone knows about it, then everyone that would have wanted to buy have already bought, right? So after launch, then who the hell was buying? That's kind of the concept. And I mean, I shared a screenshot in the bearish video, right? And the bearish case for solid x. And, you know, also, like, fundamentals matter, right? Solidly could be an amazing protocol, right? But, you know, maybe there's no need for solid x, right? You know, people like, and this. This is also, like, not Andre's fault, right? Like, Andre built Ve 33 with solidly and then the community or someone created, like, Solidx, right? The convex clone, right? I guess the convex of solidly. And the community was like, oh, my God.
00:16:33.860 - 00:17:02.080, Speaker A: Oh, every. Every ve token needs. Needs a. Needs a convex, right? But maybe that's not actually the case, right? If you actually think critically about how the protocol is designed and you can't really blame Andre for someone creating a sex token. And that token going down 90%. How is that Andre's fault? It's not even the developer's fault. I do think it's worth experimenting with a convex clone.
00:17:02.080 - 00:17:27.040, Speaker A: But the market didn't understand how. How things worked. They aped and it dumped. Right? So, you know, I still think, like, farming solidly, and, like, the solid x token, I think is like, okay, right? I mean, like, why not, right? You're not really, like, the. The only thing you're risking is, like, opportunity, cost of capital. But, you know, buying. Buying these things is, like, really, really dangerous.
00:17:27.040 - 00:18:47.852, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, and maybe, you know, Danny's long gone from this project, but, you know, a bunch of people that didn't understand tokenomics valuable just aped and, yeah, it's just a sad reality. And last thing I'll leave you guys with is, like, how did people make money from solidly, right? Like, how did smart money play solidly? And I didn't do this, but I was observing it and I was aware that this was happening, right? And if you go to, like, the 30 minutes mark of my bearish solidly video, I kind of warned everyone, hey, like, people are literally buying these things to dump on people when the farms launch, right? People are front running the farms, and then when the APR is launched, right? That's when they dump, right? The smart money was anticipating, like, I guess, like, the dumb money, what they were going to buy, and then front running those buys. And the best ex. The best. Oh, sorry. The best example is the weave token, right? I believe the weave token we're going to get was going to get a bunch of emissions solid, right? So if you were in the weave USDC farm, you were going to get a bunch of solid emissions, right? And, you know, the smart money, I guess, like, started, like, t whopping here, right? It's like, okay, like, this narrative is going to catch on.
00:18:47.852 - 00:19:24.954, Speaker A: Let's. Let's accumulate and then sell to the people that are going to end up buying our bags a few days later and it starts to go up, right? It's like, oh, my God, like, this thing is going parabolic. And when the farms launched on, like, whenever the state was, it just got dumped, right? So, you know, the smart money, like, they knew that people would buy this thing in order to farm solid, right? Even though, like, fundamentally, this thing has very, very questionable fundamentals. And then, you know, as things go up, like, there are no more. There are no more buyers, right? And it's just dumps, right. And it's back to the price where we are now. So, I mean, I took the screenshot, like, yesterday.
00:19:24.954 - 00:20:03.480, Speaker A: So maybe the price is, like, higher or something, but, you know, definitely brutal markets, right? Definitely brutal markets. Yeah, definitely brutal. Definitely brutal. So I think the weave token just shows you how rough of a market we're in, right? We're still in PvP mode. And I think if there's any lesson to be learned, it's to be aware that, you know, I guess don't buy things without super strong fundamentals. And if you are speculating, then take a risk managed position. I guess don't bet a third of your portfolio or something.
00:20:03.480 - 00:20:39.634, Speaker A: Maybe 15% to be the most aggressive or something. Or 10% or something. Whatever your number is. It's hard to say because I don't know what your portfolio is, how it's structured, but it's a think about it and maybe in the future, right, flipping these ults, right, when you see future hype plays would have been a better play, right? And I still think that anyone that, like, farmed and dumped solid and solid x did really well. You know, like, if you were just like, yeah, like, I'm just gonna farm and dump and then maybe buy when it goes Delore. So, yeah, I think. I think those are lessons.
00:20:39.634 - 00:21:09.956, Speaker A: I think that's the end of that. Yeah, that's definitely the end. You know, definitely rough. I think the phantom ecosystem needs a lot of time to repair itself. You know, I think it's gonna be really. I think this is very deflating for the ecosystem. And, I mean, I'm not saying anything negative about the ecosystem, like mid term, like mid to long term, but in the short term, like, you know, like, you shouldn't expect phantom to, like, start pumping, right? I mean, like, I.
00:21:09.956 - 00:22:01.910, Speaker A: You know, like, we're not in that type of market, right? We're not in that type of market. You don't have to buy every dip, right? You could, right? You could, right? If you. If there's a good farm or something or, you know, if you have, like, you know, if you want to, I guess. But, you know, just sentiment for phantom, it's pretty, pretty bad right now, and maybe you should be buying when sentiment is bad, but I. I think it can continue to be bad, is, like, what I'm trying to say. So hopefully these articles help you empathize, I guess, more with Andre. You know, obviously he's not perfect and, you know, he's getting a lot of hate, but, you know, sometimes you can't blame someone else.
00:22:01.910 - 00:22:40.404, Speaker A: You just have to blame yourself for believing in, like, whatever narrative, right? I mean. I mean, it's one thing if Andre, like, started pumping his bags, like, oh, my God, solidly, the best thing ever, you know? Like, Andre didn't even do anything, right. It's just like, the community that, like, pumped this pump, this thing to, like, oblivion, and then, like, you know, like, I guess the late money got wrecked. So, you know, be nice to people, right? Be nice to devs. You know, they're trying, right? Some devs are better than others, but they're all trying, right? I mean, they're all. They're all trying, right? Yeah, that's about it. I have nothing else to say.
00:22:40.404 - 00:22:41.940, Speaker A: Thank you, guys, for watching and have fun farming out there.
