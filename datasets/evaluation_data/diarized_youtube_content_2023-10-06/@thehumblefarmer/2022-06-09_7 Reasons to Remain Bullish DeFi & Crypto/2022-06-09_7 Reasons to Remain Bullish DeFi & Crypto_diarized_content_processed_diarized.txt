00:00:00.320 - 00:00:09.286, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here recording directly from Sunnyside, Austin, Texas. And recently there's been a lot of bearish posts on Twitter, YouTube, everywhere on social media. And I can't take it anymore.
00:00:09.318 - 00:00:09.486, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:09.518 - 00:00:48.326, Speaker A: It's time to buck the trend. It is my responsibility as a crypto youtuber to provide some hopium to the wider audience. So in this video, I want to give you seven reasons to remain bullish for Defi in crypto in June of 2022. So let's get right into it. The first reason to be bullish is, you know, the whole optimism and winning you saga where the Optimist foundation gave 20 million optimism tokens to win a mute on market maker, and they lost it all, right? They lost it all. And they, you know, they kind of explained this post in this mirror XYZ article, right? The message community. And long story short, you know, optimism foundation, they try to give 20 million tokens to win a mute, a market maker to market make their token, and they don't know how to do multi sigs.
00:00:48.326 - 00:00:49.382, Speaker A: So a hacker just stole them.
00:00:49.406 - 00:00:49.686, Speaker B: All, right?
00:00:49.718 - 00:00:58.130, Speaker A: Just stolen, all right. 20 million tokens gone to the hacker, right? And to respond, the optimist foundation gave another 20 million tokens to Wintermu.
00:00:58.170 - 00:00:58.418, Speaker B: Right?
00:00:58.474 - 00:01:10.746, Speaker A: I mean, this is bullish, right? This is super, super bullish. Because if Wintermu loses 20 million more optimism tokens, right, they lose 40 million tokens, right, coming directly from the team. And if the team don't have their tokens, they can't dump on us.
00:01:10.818 - 00:01:11.050, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:11.090 - 00:01:25.738, Speaker A: And we can't have a bullish market in crypto if the team and the VC's are dumping on us. So, you know, the less teams are dumping on us, the more bullish things are. And, you know, it's also gonna lead to further decentralization of the network, community ownership. Right. Public goods.
00:01:25.794 - 00:01:26.106, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:26.178 - 00:01:33.570, Speaker A: I mean, it's impossible not to be optimistic on optimism right now, right? And if you go to the website, the optimism protocol generates boatloads of revenue.
00:01:33.610 - 00:01:33.786, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:33.818 - 00:02:04.354, Speaker A: I think they forgot to add four hackers at the end of the sentence, but that's fine because, you know, rocket emoji, second rocket emoji, three rocket emojis, optimism to $3. It's programmed into the code. Send it goodbye opportunity right now, not financial advice. Okay. Second reason to be bullish, crypto in general, is Kane Warwick, his response to the whole optimism and winmute saga. So for those that do not know, Kane Warwick is the founder of Synthetix, right? He's been in the crypto space for a long time. And he's also very bullish optimism.
00:02:04.402 - 00:02:04.586, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:04.618 - 00:02:25.278, Speaker A: I mean, look at his Twitter handle. He has, like, red balls or something, right? Red balls. He's bullish optimism. And he was kind of defending the optimism team for their incompetence. But, you know, maybe it's not incompetence, right? Because crypto is kind of hard, right? And if you're managing a bunch of tokens, your own tokens, you know, it's sometimes if you're careless. It's okay, it's okay. You know why? Because Kane, one time, he had 20 tabs open, right? Look at the bottom tweet.
00:02:25.278 - 00:02:37.110, Speaker A: He had 20 tabs open, right? And he was, he didn't know what was going on. He was like, oh, my God, I have so many tabs open. I'm gonna do some transactions. Bam. 10 million died. Burned, right? This is bullish. This is super, super bullish.
00:02:37.110 - 00:03:06.820, Speaker A: Because now, because Kane is the type of person that can lose $10 million worth of die in a single click, it is now more statistically likely that he is going to burn his own synthetix tokens, therefore reduced reducing circulating supply and making price for synthetics go up, which the community really needs, because that token is, like, down 95% or something, right. Rocket emoji. Second. Sorry. Third reason to be bullish crypto right now, osmosis validators cares about family. They really care about family. It's all about family, right? For the familia.
00:03:06.820 - 00:03:20.602, Speaker A: Sorry, I'm not going to edit that up. So a critical bug has been found which could have potentially drained all liquidity pulls. Okay. And the chain was halted.
00:03:20.626 - 00:03:20.762, Speaker B: Right?
00:03:20.786 - 00:03:21.314, Speaker A: Osmosis.
00:03:21.362 - 00:03:21.858, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:21.994 - 00:03:55.840, Speaker A: You know, yeah. Cosmos hub, right? Map of zones makes a lot of sense. And fire stake, which is a validator for osmosis, you know, knew about this, right? They found out about this potential exploit where people could just, you know, halt these liquidity pools. And in the process, they were testing it out, right? And they took $200, $226, to be exact, and they turned it into $2 million. And they were thinking about their family's future instead of the future of the community, right? And then after someone called them out on it, they were like, oh, shit, they caught us.
00:03:55.880 - 00:03:56.320, Speaker B: Right?
00:03:56.440 - 00:04:17.702, Speaker A: How do we make this right? And then now they're stressed right now because they cared about their family. They're now stressed, and they don't know what to do. This is bullish. Because in order for us to have the next leg in the bull market, we need a more normie adoption. Right? We need people that don't own crypto to have wealth in crypto. And it's more likely that, no, the validators family don't own crypto than the community.
00:04:17.766 - 00:04:17.942, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:17.966 - 00:04:19.782, Speaker A: The community only, like, already owns crypto.
00:04:19.806 - 00:04:19.942, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:19.966 - 00:04:55.994, Speaker A: Like, they're not going to buy our bags, right? It's better that money goes to, you know, the family's hands because maybe they buy real estate or something, but in, maybe they buy like one bitcoin, right? And, you know, buying one bitcoin is better than like, not buying bitcoin, right? We have to grow the pie when it comes to crypto. Crypto profits buying our bags. You know all that, right? So this is very bullish rocket emoji, right? Fourth dow, treasury management. So recently there's been a bunch of posts on governance proposals by protocols like Lido and tribe to essentially sell a bunch of their treasury assets, you know, tokens down like 90%. Ethereum is down 60%. Now is the right time to sell.
00:04:56.042 - 00:04:56.466, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:56.578 - 00:05:36.524, Speaker A: And, you know, people think this is bearish, right? People think it's bearish, right? But if you think about it, this is also very, very bullish because daos aren't selling their own tokens, right? They're selling other projects tokens. So lido, they're selling eth, right? Tribe on the right hand side, they're selling liquidity tokens, curve tokens, convex, toke, aave and gold comp, they're not selling their own tokens. So, you know, if they're not selling their own tokens and selling other people's tokens, that's bullish, because it means that their token is more likely to outperform their peers. And we all care about relative outperformance in the markets. Outperform bitcoin, outperform other DeFi tokens. That's what we're here for. Fifth reason, USDD is very, very over collateralized.
00:05:36.524 - 00:06:14.340, Speaker A: So USDD, the tron stablecoin offers risk free yield, 20% on USDD. I've never seen that before. I mean, that's pretty crazy, right? That's pretty crazy. And if you go to the transparency tab on their website, tdoi.org, comma, you see that the current total USD supply is 700 million and the collateralization ratio is 202%. But if you actually look deeply, right, you have to look at the fine print here. The collateral backing USDT already takes into account the TRX burned already, also in TRX in the reserves, right? This is bullish because it makes a lot of sense.
00:06:14.340 - 00:06:37.744, Speaker A: Okay, number six, 6th reason to be bullish is poop, right? Poop is bullish. You know, gastrointestinal health, very, very important. And one of the most hyped up NFT projects right now is this. Il poop NFT, right? Or, sorry, I'll poop it Nft by shirt deployer. And, you know, the font is kind of weird. The floor right now is roughly 1.25. I think it's higher now, right? Because, you know, digital scarcity.
00:06:37.744 - 00:07:01.718, Speaker A: And there's a one, three k owners for 10,000 poop, right? I mean, I got, I guess I, people like to hold, like, I guess, like, on average, like 7.5 proof per person. And if you actually kind of look at it, kind of. Kind of pretty nice, right? Kind of pretty nice, right? And it says, like, on, on the burger. How about you stop flipping shit and actually hold onto it? I mean, that's. Those are pretty wise words, right? Like, I would definitely pay 1.25 e for this.
00:07:01.718 - 00:07:10.382, Speaker A: And this is bullish because if people are paying a few grand on poop pictures, then it makes it more likely that, you know, they make the connection and buy our heavy shitcoin bags.
00:07:10.406 - 00:07:10.542, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:10.566 - 00:07:15.050, Speaker A: And buy our heavy bags, right? Here's an example, right? Let me, let me get my heavy bags.
00:07:18.750 - 00:07:19.182, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:19.246 - 00:07:39.870, Speaker A: So these are my, these are my heavy bags right now, right? You know, defi kingdoms. Let's see what's actually in these bags. Okay, so let's see. What is this? Oh, nice. You know, there's, there's jewel in my heavy bags. That makes a lot of sense. Okay, I think there's one more shirt in here.
00:07:39.870 - 00:08:01.886, Speaker A: Let's see. Oh, nice, nice. Saturday. I hope that chain is still operating, right? Because sometimes it doesn't operate. But, you know, we all have bags. We all need people to buy our bags. And, you know, if, if these NFTs are selling at like $3,000, then, you know, I'm pretty, I'm pretty optimistic, right? Optimism to $3, right? Three rocket emojis.
00:08:01.886 - 00:08:34.474, Speaker A: And the last reason to be, to be super bullish to markets right now is my YouTube metrics, right? Like, I'm very, very data dependent. I'm similar to the fed, right? I look at the data and I like, you know, I make my decisions that way. And, you know, I recently made this tweet about, you know, this, the trend, right, where every time I post a video, I lose subscribers. And, you know, the, if you look at the May 17 tab, right, that was the Cardano video, right? I lost, like, 60 subscribers in that video, right? Super bullish. And in this video, I'll probably lose like 100 subs. Right. That's totally fine.
00:08:34.474 - 00:08:48.494, Speaker A: And people are realizing that, you know, I don't really know what I'm doing or my videos are a reminder that they own crypto and they want to get rid of the pain by unsubbing. It makes a lot of sense. And people say that this is bearish. Right? People are leaving the space. I don't really think so.
00:08:48.542 - 00:08:48.870, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:48.950 - 00:09:05.870, Speaker A: Because it's bullish. Because I was recently in this panel at Decentral, how to be a humble defi farmer. But is Defi dead, right. I was one of the panelists. That's why I'm in southern side, Austin, Texas. And also I want, I want to see Charles Hoskinson. But this is bullish because I literally did this defi dead panel.
00:09:05.870 - 00:09:09.438, Speaker A: And because people are unsubscribing, people are less likely to watch that.
00:09:09.494 - 00:09:09.686, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:09.718 - 00:09:13.606, Speaker A: I mean, less reasons to be bearish means more bullish crypto.
00:09:13.638 - 00:09:14.094, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:14.222 - 00:09:34.060, Speaker A: Rocket emoji. So hopefully this video has given you seven reasons to remain bullish to crypto markets. And, you know, hopefully you buy my bags or something because, yeah, my bags are heavy. But aside from that, I don't know, like, is there any reason to be bearish right now? Like, I don't really think so. Right. I, I think I've given a pretty, like solid argument.
00:09:34.100 - 00:09:34.276, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:34.308 - 00:09:48.396, Speaker A: Rock solid argument on, like, why you should be bullish to crypto markets right now. Please make sure to like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. You know, it really helps me out with my YouTube metrics, right. I keep losing subscribers. I don't know what to do. I'm panicking right now.
00:09:48.396 - 00:09:52.860, Speaker A: But thank you guys for watching and have fun for me out there. And rocket emoji.
