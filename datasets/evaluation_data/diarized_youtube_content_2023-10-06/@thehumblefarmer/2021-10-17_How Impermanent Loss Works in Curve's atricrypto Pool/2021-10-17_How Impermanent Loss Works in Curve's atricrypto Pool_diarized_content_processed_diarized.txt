00:00:01.120 - 00:00:13.718, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Taiki here. And in this video I'm gonna go over how impermanent loss works in Curve's HVAC crypto pool. If you like the content, please like and subscribe. Leave a comment in the comment section below. So let's get started. Okay, so everyone likes curve. They're multi chain.
00:00:13.718 - 00:01:13.292, Speaker A: They have liquidity money incentives on a bunch of chains, including avalanche, phantom, as well as arbitrum and the curve. The tricrypto pool that I highlighted here, if you don't know how it works, essentially, think of it as you're being a liquidity provider for three assets, right? Deposited equally 33% of bitcoin. Ethan stablecoins and I made a couple videos talking about imprimanant loss and how that affects, I guess, your yields on tricrypto. And I just wanted to make this video because what my, I guess my understanding of implemented loss for this particular pool was incorrect. And I want to go over like, what I got wrong and show mathematical proofs of like, what the actual impermanent loss and opportunity cost is. Because the fact that it took this long for someone in the community to correct me on this probably means that a bunch of other people, probably including yourself, don't have a great understanding of impermanent loss for this particular pool as well. Okay, so in my previous video on Friday, I mentioned that, hey, like, if bitcoin goes up three x eth goes up 75%, your impermanent loss for this particular pool is going to be 9.39%.
00:01:13.292 - 00:01:53.738, Speaker A: And I guess the way I framed this impermanent loss was saying, hey, like, if you started with, let's say, $6,000 in bitcoin, if you just held it, you'd have $18,000, right? Because it would triple. However, with the 9.39% impermanent loss, you'd have $16,310, plus whatever rewards you earn because of impermanent loss. So feel free to pause this video if you just want to quickly test your knowledge. Think of it as like, a quiz on, like, okay, like, what did I get wrong, right? And like, what is the actual impermanent loss? But I'm gonna keep going because, you know, I'm not making this video. But let me just define what impermanent loss is and then go over a simple example and then dive into, like, the facts that I got wrong. And you know what, what the actual numbers are.
00:01:53.738 - 00:02:42.714, Speaker A: So when I think about impermanent loss, I think of it as the opportunity cost of being a liquidity provider. It's how much you lose by being an LP relative to just holding the assets. Impermanent loss is the result of the LP position, selling the outperforming asset to buy more of the underperforming asset, right? And I'll give a more tangible example here if that doesn't make any sense to you. So let's just start simple with neat USDC pool for uniswap v two, right? Suturesoft, et cetera. So when you're a liquidity provider, you just deposit two assets, right, in equal ratios into the pool, and you earn a part of the swap fees. And let's just assume that the price of ETH is 1000. And you know, price of stablecoin is a dollar and you deposit one ETH in 1000 USDC, right? Like 50 50 ratio, bam, included in there.
00:02:42.714 - 00:03:17.284, Speaker A: And let's just assume for the sake of simplicity, that this particular liquidity pool has ten e and 10,000 USDC. So I own 10% of the pool. And let's say ETH just goes on a crazy run and it goes to $4,000, right, in like a couple of days or something. Well, now, ten ETH is now worth more than 10,000 USDC. So essentially this liquidity pool has to sell some ETH and buy more USDC so that the ratios are equal, right? So this essentially happens. And since the ratio must be equal, there's now going to be five ETH and 20,000 USDC in the LP pool. So think of it as ETH goes up.
00:03:17.284 - 00:03:47.062, Speaker A: So the pool is going to sell some ETH to buy more USDC so they can meet in the middle. And since I own 10% of the pool when I pull out, right, let's just say I just want to pull out immediately. I get 10% of the pool, which is going to be 0.5 yield and 2000 USDC. Now this is 20% impermanent loss. Because if I did not be, if I did an LP, I would have one ETH and 1000 USDC, which would equal to $5,000. But because I provide liquidity, I would have $2,000 of USDC and half it needs, which is $2,000.
00:03:47.062 - 00:04:11.650, Speaker A: So it's $4,000, right. You also get swap fees and whatever farming rewards. Yeah, but you know, this is a 20% imperial loss that, you know, people talk about. And, you know, the more an asset goes up relative to the other asset, there's gonna be more implement loss. Yada, yada, yada. So the way I think about it is you know, a mental model is like, because I was an LP and ETH went up a lot, I incurred a 20% opportunity cost by trying to farm using the ETH USDC pair. Cool.
00:04:11.650 - 00:05:04.974, Speaker A: But, you know, let's go back to this hi crypto pool and think about what happens when there's three assets involved instead of just two, right? So let's go over this example. So just think of it like this, right? It's a 33% ratio of bitcoin, e and stable coins, right? It's not just USDC, but, you know, just stable coins in general. And let's just assume that, you know, we starting out with $6,000, we just split it up, right? We take $6,000 or whatever asset, we just put it in there and curve will split up into, you know, $2,000 of bitcoin, eat and stable coins. And let's go back to this example, right? The initial example where bitcoin triples in value and ETH goes up 75%. What is the actual impermanent loss? What is the actual opportunity cost, right? So, you know, if you started with $6,000 of bitcoin, if you just held it, you'd have $18,000, right? Because, I mean, six times three is 18. But the 9.39% of implement loss doesn't apply to the $18,000, which is what I got wrong.
00:05:04.974 - 00:05:32.832, Speaker A: It actually applies to what I would have earned if I just have. If I did not LPD. Assuming I held $2,000 of bitcoin, $2,000 of ETH, and $2,000 of stable coins, right? Because if I didn't LP, right, and I split up my assets into, you know, three. Three buckets, $2,000 of each with ease. If bitcoin goes up three x, I'd have $6,000 of bitcoin. If ETH goes up 75%, I have $3,500 of ETH, and then stable coins don't move. So, you know, in total, I would have $11,500.
00:05:32.832 - 00:06:07.154, Speaker A: Right? And then permanent loss applies to this number, not the 18,000, which is what I got wrong. So, you know, due to the permanent loss, if this happens, you'd pull out $10,420. Additionally, also, like, the yield you get from the tricrypto pool. So, you know, if I just held the bitcoin, right, I would have $18,000. But the real opportunity cost to being a liquidity provider for tricrypto versus, like, just being a bitcoin maxi is $10,420. Versus $18,000, which is roughly 42% opportunity cost. This isn't impermanent loss, right? Because it's not like, it's not like it's a definition of implement loss.
00:06:07.154 - 00:06:48.790, Speaker A: This is like the opportunity cost of, you know, depositing $6,000 of bitcoin into the tricypto pool relative to just holding bitcoin, you know, in your wallet, like on Aave or just like wherever. Right? But let's go over like a more realistic example, right? I don't really think bitcoin is going to go up three x anytime soon, maybe in like the next year or something. But let's. This is like a more realistic example, right, where bitcoin goes up 50%, it goes up 75% over the course of a few months. Yeah, I mean, this is totally reasonable. Right? Now, the impermanent loss for this particular pool is 2.65%. But, you know, with our new understanding of tricrypto pool and implement loss, let's go over, like, what the real, what the impermanent loss is, as well as the opportunity cost of just holding e.
00:06:48.790 - 00:07:34.440, Speaker A: So with this example, if I didn't LP, I'd have $8500, right? Just doing simple mathematic, and the 2.65% implement loss would mean that I would pull out $8,275 plus whatever yield I would earn. However, if I just held ETH, I'd have $10,500, right, because it's appreciated. So the opportunity cost compared to just being an ETH maxi is 21% 82 75 versus 10.5k. Right? So I mean, I'm assuming that, like, we all know, like, what asset is going to outperform next, right? Like maybe stablecoins outperform the next two months and, and being in Asia, crypto is better. Maybe bitcoin outperforms, maybe ETH forms, but these are the simple examples of. Okay, I guess our initial understanding, or my initial understanding of implement loss was incorrect for this tri crypto pool.
00:07:34.440 - 00:08:14.442, Speaker A: And I just wanted to bring over some mathematical examples of what APY means in the grand scheme of things, because, yes, 28% APY is great, but if you actually do the math, you're going to earn 0.5% per week, assuming that the 28% APY is stable. Right? So, you know, understanding this, like, is it really worth, you know, if you, if you're gigabullish eTH or gigabullish bitcoin, is it worth being a liquidity provider for tricrypto when you're only earning 2% a month on, on your assets. Even if you increase this to 200%, you know, you're only going to be earning 2% a month. Sorry, 2% a week and nine and a half percent a month. Obviously, if it's APR, the numbers are more favorable. 4% a week, 16% a month.
00:08:14.442 - 00:09:02.402, Speaker A: But, you know, I mean, 4% a week. I mean, we get 4% hourly candles on bitcoin, like in, like, sometimes too, right? It's like, you know, like no one's getting out of bed for like a 4%, 4% yield. So, you know, implement loss and opportunity cost is something to consider as a farmer, right. It might not be the best way to expose or, I guess, express a bullish view on bitcoin and EtH, which is, you know, something I got wrong. And I apologize for anyone that just, like, you know, blindly believed in me and just like, you know, just like, allocated portfolio in that way. But, you know, better, better late than never when it comes to admitting your mistakes and, you know, correcting yourself. But what if, you know, bitcoin and eth goes down right, like this? Because we also have to consider the possible scenario that, like, you know, these, like, this market is not up, only it's going to go up, it's going to go down, and it's going to be a cyclical market.
00:09:02.402 - 00:09:43.114, Speaker A: So what if bitcoin goes out down 20% and eth goes down 30%? So assuming the same example, we start with $2,000 each. If I did not LLP, I'd have $5,000, but with the 1.1% improvement in loss, I'd pull out 49.45. Okay. So, you know, however, this, this shows you how impairment loss actually protects you to the downside when it comes to tricrypto, because if you just held $6,000 bitcoin through a 20% correction, you have $4,800 and $4,200 if you held Aldi and it went down 30%. So, you know, I'd say that curve's tricrypto pool helps mitigate downside risk, but you will incur heavy, impermanent loss or opportunity cost in case crypto enters a EU four phase. Right.
00:09:43.114 - 00:10:29.778, Speaker A: Also curve HR, crypto, it's great when the market just going sideways, right? Because you're not incurring opportunity costs and permanent loss, you're just collecting the yield. So that being said, like, what is like, a better way to earn yield on bitcoin, ETH and other assets? Well, you know, this is what I've primarily been doing for like the past couple of months. But you know, I really like to use incentivized money markets to avoid implement loss and it adds more optionality. So I made this tweet a week ago and I was like, maybe it's time for bitcoin maxi season. We can just hold bitcoin as collateral, be pay to borrow dollars against it and farm play around with those staples. And you know, as a farmer, this is comfy season and, you know, it's going to be like a really good opportunity to earn yield on ETH in bitcoin without incurring impermanent loss. So, you know, I just took the screenshot a few days ago.
00:10:29.778 - 00:11:36.562, Speaker A: You know this, you can earn 5% on bitcoin and you can essentially take out a free loan on tether, right? Sometimes with USDC as well. I mean, obviously, depending on the markets, these fluctuate, but generally you can earn, or you can borrow dollars on a, you can borrow dollars on tantrum for relatively 0% interest, essentially. And what you could do is you can take those dollars and instead of putting it in the tricrypto pool, you can just put it in avalanche, aave just a stablecoin pool and earn 24.5% on it. So if you just do the math on this alternate strategy, you can deposit $6,000 or wrap the coin into AaVE, earn 5% on that, borrow $2,500 in USDT interest rate. You can borrow something else if you want, but you know, just, I'm just choosing the stablecoin with the best interest rate and then you can deposit those that tether on the curve earning 24%. And if you do the math, you can earn roughly 15% on your bitcoin and you're not incurring any implement loss, right? And also this is more, this adds more flexibility because, you know, you can pay back your, your tether debt whenever, right? And you can, and like if you're an experienced farmer, like you can earn a way more than 24% on stable coins, like in this relatively safe manner on other farms as well.
00:11:36.562 - 00:12:27.682, Speaker A: So 15% is, this is like the safest yield I can earn on bitcoin given like a relatively safe Health factor. And, you know, just like not taking risk on potentially getting rugged or exploited. And you might be wondering like, hey, like, how do I know that $2,500 loan against six k of bitcoin is safe? Well, I did, I did a little simulation to just play this why I think I consider this safe, right? You always have to do your own research, but what you can do is you can. So I have six k bitcoin here, $2500 here. If you click on the details tab here, this thing pops up, right? And it'll say this liquidation threshold is 75%, meaning that if my. If my loan gets to 75% of the value of my collateral, my position is at risk of being liquidated. So what you can do is you can just take $2500 depending, divided by 75%, which is roughly $3,333.
00:12:27.682 - 00:13:00.464, Speaker A: And this means that if my collateral dips to that number, I get liquidated. And if I have $6,000 of bitcoin, then this means that this is going to happen. If bitcoin dumps 44.5% overnight, which is generally unlikely, I wouldn't put it against bitcoin, but it's very, very unlikely. What if bitcoin is down 20% tomorrow? I'm not going to just watch my position about to get liquidated. I'm going to pay the accident. It has to be, you know, it has to dump x percent overnight in order for you to get liquidated, right? Because when you wake up and your position is dangerous, you can easily pay back your loan.
00:13:00.464 - 00:13:37.526, Speaker A: So this is kind of the way to think about things. And, you know, this is my mistake. I'm sorry. If you, you know, if you've, like, told all your friends and family that, hey, like, you can earn 28% on bitcoin, but just wanted to correct my mistake. And I think a lot of people, like, even like my, like, farmer friends, my defi friends, crypto natives, people that have been in this space for longer, way longer than I have, did not bring this up to me. And their understanding was my initial understanding. So hopefully this clears up any misconception that I guess people had with incremental loss, HR, crypto pool, and hopefully this gives you a better way to manage your portfolio to the upside, to the downside, or whether we're on the sideways market.
00:13:37.526 - 00:13:39.550, Speaker A: Thank you guys for watching and have fun forming out there.
