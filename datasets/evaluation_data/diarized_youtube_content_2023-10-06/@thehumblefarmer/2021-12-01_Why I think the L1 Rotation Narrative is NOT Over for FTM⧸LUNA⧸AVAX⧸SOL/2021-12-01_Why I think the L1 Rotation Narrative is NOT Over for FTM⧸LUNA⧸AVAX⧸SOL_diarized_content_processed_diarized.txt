00:00:00.760 - 00:00:27.134, Speaker A: What is up, guys? Tyke here today. I'd like to go over the Eat BTC chart and the narratives surrounding it is eat about to take over. The markets leave bitcoin in the dust. And is the l one rotation narrative dead? Right. Is phantom, Luna, Solana, avalanche? Are those coins dead? I see a lot of narratives around that from, like, the eth maxi community, right. But, you know, I feel for the eth maxi community, right? Because, like, they can't use their own chain. But, you know, even though I am bullish eth, I'm the most bullish eth.
00:00:27.134 - 00:01:11.658, Speaker A: I still think in the short term, in this particular world market, the l one rotation, that narrative is here to stay. And I'll give my reasonings surrounding that, and, you know, I'll give my reasonings on why I think Luna and Phantom is next. So back to this chart. So, this is obviously the EBTC chart taking the price of ethereum and dividing it by the price of bitcoin. When the markets topped in, I guess, mid may, the EBTC chart ran up roughly 170% in a span of six weeks, which, you know, I guess, like, ran up way too fast. And for ETH to flip bitcoin, it has to get to roughly 0.1625, which is roughly another 100% from here, right? So if the price of eth outperforms bitcoin by 100%, then EtH will flip bitcoin.
00:01:11.658 - 00:01:43.826, Speaker A: Right, in terms of market cap, obviously, you know, bitcoin is inflationary, right? They're like mining new bitcoins every single day. And Eth is theoretically, you know, it could be deflationary. It could be inflationary. So, you know, these ratios aren't perfect, but generally, if EBTC goes up 100%, it's going to be flipping. And my thoughts on the flipping is that I think it can happen, right? And for this cycle, I think if Eth flips bitcoin, it would be the most top signal thing ever. Right? If it happens, then I'm just gonna. I'm most likely gonna go super risk off, because, yes, in the long term, I think it can happen.
00:01:43.826 - 00:02:06.828, Speaker A: I used to be a bitcoin, maxi, and I used to be like, oh, it's never gonna happen. Bitcoin for life. But, you know, after being in this space for so long, I think that, you know, you know, it's. It's dumb, right? I think it's unreasonable to rule out the possibility that, you know, this, the flipping can happen, you know, just because, you know, that can't scale right now. And l two. I mean, the e 2.0 narrative that sharding and, like, those.
00:02:06.828 - 00:02:40.532, Speaker A: There are, like, some risks there if the markets get to the point where they're actually. Plus bitcoin and market cap, I just feel like, you know, that's just, like, peak euphoria phase. And in hindsight, you know, you know, let's say you're in the year 2024. It would be like the most obvious top signal ever. But, you know, but in the meantime, let's try to make money in the markets. Farming rotation, whatever. And the reason why I mentioned earlier in the video that the l one rotation I don't think is dead is because in this particular bull market, I feel like every crypto coin is valued relative to one another.
00:02:40.532 - 00:03:43.906, Speaker A: So let's kind of go over coingecko and look at, I guess, like, the top, I guess, 50 in terms of l one, sdhe, and like, all these other coins as well. So obviously, bitcoin number one, and Ethereum is at $550 billion in market cap. And how, I believe, right, these other l ones and why they've done so well is the simple narrative of, why can't Solana be 10% the market cap of Ethereum? And then people look at each other and be like, wait, that kind of makes sense. Like, why can't it be, right? And then Solana just went up, like, 100 x, and I spent a few months avalanche. Why can't avalanche be, like, 5% of market cap of Ethereum? Okay, that makes sense, right? Why can't it, right? And then obviously, you know, like, then the slippery slope is, like, why can't it be also be 10% the market cap of Ethereum? Right? Like, if Cardano is 51 billion, then why can't avalanche be over 51 billion, right? I mean, it's definitely possible. And I think it could get there, right? If, you know, if the fundamentals do align similarly for Luna, why can't Luna be 10% the market cap of Ethereum? Why can't. Why can't Luna be worth more than Cardano? Like, I don't really see a narrative around that.
00:03:43.906 - 00:04:45.788, Speaker A: Obviously. This is definitely bull market things, right? Because in this particular market, right, when, you know, we're in this EVM clone scalability narrative, like all these, like, all these narratives that pop up every single month, it's, you know, it's, like, the best way to value these cryptocurrencies. And I feel like twelve to 24 months from now, like, it's not gonna make any sense, right? Because you do have to like, in a bear market, like, this narrative is not gonna stand and you have to value these things based on fundamentals. But, you know, how do you value avalanche, right? 28 billion? If avalanche is 28 billion, then why can't. Like, why is Luna 25 billion, right? Like, how do you value these things? It's super hard to value, like, whether avax or Luna should have a higher market cap than polkadot, a higher market cap than Algorand, because it's mostly driven on hype narratives. And whatever the short term narrative is, crypto is very reflexive in the fact that on the way up, people become more bullish, and on the way down, people become more bearish. This is the reason why, you know, on the recent run up for, you know, eat, right, everyone, like, all the ethnic are super loud.
00:04:45.788 - 00:05:16.516, Speaker A: Like, yeah, like, eat is so much better. And then, you know, in the recent run up for avalanche, it's like, oh, yeah. Like, avalanche is the best. And then I'm sure in the recent. In the coming weeks, you know, you're gonna see a bunch of Luna narratives and, you know, I'm guilty of that, right? I mean, I'm like a bullheart when it comes to Luna. So obviously I'll be bull posting and making these videos. But, you know, crypto is driven on narratives, and in order for you to profit off of crypto, it's kind of important to kind of foresee what the narrative is going to be in the future.
00:05:16.516 - 00:06:00.576, Speaker A: And obviously, Luna has some super strong narratives coming up with the launch of Astroport coming next week. So let's kind of compare Luna to that, I guess, the avalanche coin, right? Because I think there are similar things going forward. So if you remember, I mean, I've been covering avalanche for a while now, but, you know, the initial run up, right. Was based off of avalanche Rush coming, you know, billion dollars in the program, $500 million in the program, like, whatever you want to call it, it's gonna be so bullish. Oh, my God, coinbase is coming soon. And then when Coinbase launched, avalanche rush kept getting delayed, right? It just, like, kept dragging us, and then the coin dumped. But over time, people are like, oh, wait, Avantrus is still here, right? Just because they delete it doesn't mean that it's not actually coming.
00:06:00.576 - 00:06:19.550, Speaker A: And then it's like, okay, full send it, right? And this was kind of essentially like the ABC, I guess, the hype cycle for avalanche. And though I am bullish, avalanche, bullish subnets, they're actually decentralized. It scales pretty well. Recently, they've been running into issues with scalability. Right. The gas fees are kind of high and they had a recent rug. Right.
00:06:19.550 - 00:06:57.342, Speaker A: I mean, I'm not going to speculate if it's a rug or not, but like one of the own forks, allegedly rugged. So the narrative there might be, you know, weakened, I guess. And, you know, I suspect avalanche can definitely get to 10% of marketing ethereum, right? Like, it's so easy for people to think that way, right? And which is one of the reasons, like, these narratives exist in the first place. So I think avalanche needs a few weeks to consolidate, but, you know, after that, like, what's stopping it? And similarly, I think the recent underperformance of Luna is driven on a similar narrative. It's like, okay, astropore is coming, Mars is coming to, going to be the greatest thing ever. And then it got delayed. Right? It's like, oh my God.
00:06:57.342 - 00:07:09.694, Speaker A: Like, I thought it was coming in mid November. Now it's coming in early December. Actual token is launching in late late December. It's like, oh my God, we got rugged Delphi digital ruggedness. And now that next week is going to be astropor. Right? It's the month. It's December 1.
00:07:09.694 - 00:07:28.952, Speaker A: Oh, it's December. It's astropor time. It's like full Sunday, right. And it's kind of dumb to think about it like this, but I feel like, you know, like you shouldn't try to outsmart the markets. You should just listen to the markets and behave accordingly. And that's kind of how I've been doing it. And, you know, I don't necessarily think that Luna is going to just like Giga sent from here, right.
00:07:28.952 - 00:07:48.792, Speaker A: Because I still argue that I don't think it's going to do that. I argue it's going to be more like a slow grind up, right. Something like this. Maybe just because I think the killer app for the terra ecosystem is going to be nomores protocol. I think it's going to lock up the highest TvL in the terra ecosystem. It's going to flip anchor. I believe they're going to allow for m assets as collateral rights.
00:07:48.792 - 00:08:17.120, Speaker A: Like stocks as collateral. Right. Think about using Apple, the stock as collateral, borrowed dollars against it, farm on anchor to earn 20% and whatnot. And I don't know if it's going to be available for all retail, but Mars is also going to introduce under collateralized lending, which for a DeFi protocol is pretty important. I think the under collateralized lending aspect is only going to be available for whitelisted whales. So institutions and whatnot. But still, I still think it's great innovation, and I think Mars is going to be the killer protocol.
00:08:17.120 - 00:09:00.004, Speaker A: And Mars is only going to launch roughly in January, I believe. Right? Maybe if you're optimistic, like, late December, but let's just be conservative and say, like, mid January. So until Mars and Aster are both live and doing well, I don't really necessarily think that the price of Luna can, like, go parabolic. I mean, don't get me wrong, it could, right? Luna is one of my comfiest holds, and I continue to hold this token. Okay, so let's kind of go over the astroport, right? This is the website. Pretty slick, right? If we're living in the 2017 narrative, a slick website means that it's worthy of a billion dollar valuation. So let's kind of go over, like, how I think about astroport and why I think it's going to be, you know, really hyped up and anticipated to launch.
00:09:00.004 - 00:09:38.010, Speaker A: So I think Astroport is going to command at least a $500 million market cap. Astraport is going to be the premier Dex on the terra ecosystem. They are not going to have any competitors, which is pretty important, and it's going to be the Uniswap curve and balancer of terra. And I think the combination of those three dexs in one protocol with Delphi Digital or Delphi Labs, they designed the tokenomics of axie Infinity. They did the economic design for Aave, the Delphi digital. Their team is super strong. They're designing the tokenomics and the economic model for astroport and Mars.
00:09:38.010 - 00:10:12.480, Speaker A: Delphi Labs is heavily involved in the terror ecosystem. And that lock drop, the airdrop, all those things, is very carefully designed, and I suspect that it's going to do really well. So let's kind of go over the airdrop. That's going to happen, right? So I've been covering terra in the Luna ecosystem for what is, like, five months now, and anyone that's participated in the terra ecosystem is going to receive an airdrop. And I suspect that this airdrop is going to be worth roughly four figures. I mean, this is wishful thinking, right? You should always be cautious, because I'm just, like, super biased towards a terror ecosystem. But, you know, at least.
00:10:12.480 - 00:10:48.206, Speaker A: At least, like, know that right beforehand. But essentially, the airdrop is going to. The recipients for the airdrop are going to be t five chads, right? So, you know, you and I, if we're in the terror ecosystem since July, we are the t five chads, and we're going to receive an airdrop, and I'll kind of go quickly go over the log drop phase one and phase two. So the airdrop, the Astro airdrop, is going to be given to two types of people. So anyone that's had their Luna staked or had be Luna on anchor prior to September 9, or actually, I think it has to be on September 9. I think they took a snapshot on that particular date. And you're going to receive an airdrop.
00:10:48.206 - 00:11:33.084, Speaker A: So if you've been following my videos, earning 40% in the terra ecosystem with your Luna as collateral, right, you're going to receive the start off, right? Because I think most of us have had be Luna as collateral on anchor, and we're gonna receive twelve and a half million tokens. I don't really know how it's gonna be distributed, but, you know, that's a lot of tokens. And then anyone had, anyone that was providing liquidity on Terraswap on September 9 is gonna receive 12.5 million tokens. So I think anyone that were liquidity providers, liquidity providers for Terraswap is gonna get a lot more tokens, right? Because the number of people doing this is much lower than the number of people staking it, right. I mean, almost everyone in the terra ecosystem has been staking, right, whether it be on terra station or on anchor. So I feel like I'm not going to get that many tokens, but it is what it is.
00:11:33.084 - 00:11:51.632, Speaker A: I'll take a free airdrop, and hopefully it's worth at least four figures, right. I think it's going to be a pretty good airdrop. We'll see, we'll see. And then what's confusing is like the log drop aspect, right? I've had a lot of questions. Even I don't fully understand this super well. I'm more in the camp of. I understand, like, 80% of it.
00:11:51.632 - 00:12:15.726, Speaker A: And when it actually launches, I'll look into it deeper, check the numbers, and kind of figure it out from here. But essentially, phase one is you can provide liquidity on Terraswap and take those LP tokens and migrate it over into astroport. I don't like. You don't need to be a liquidity provider today. You just need to just take your LP tokens between December 6 and December 13 and migrate it over. Right. So I think there's a lot of confusion.
00:12:15.726 - 00:12:46.496, Speaker A: Like, you have to do it now, you don't have to. I mean, you could, right. You can do it anything you want, right? But that's kind of how it works. So 34% of the tokens is going to go to Luna Ust, you know, pretty good pool. I'm sure a lot of people go 19% to inc UST, right? So I think I farmed roughly like $1,000 with anchor token. So I'm just going to pair it up with $1,000 of USD and just put it into here, right? And just like farm some astro and the majority of my funds is going to go to the be Luna Luna pool, right? Yes. It's only 15% of the distribution.
00:12:46.496 - 00:13:13.514, Speaker A: I think it's going to be oversubscribed, meaning that everyone is going to want to use be Luna Luna, right. Because there's like little impermanent loss. But for me, I'm super bullish on the price of Luna, so I don't really want to deal with Luna USD for impermanent loss risk. I'm just going to be happy. The way I would be thinking about this is just imagine that you're going to stake Luna right into this pool, right, because it's no impermanent loss, essentially. And then you're going to be able to receive astro tokens and maybe the APY APR is going to be super low. But, you know, I don't care.
00:13:13.514 - 00:13:37.282, Speaker A: I'm just going to take my lp tokens or take my Luna stick it in here, earn Astro. So that's going to be phase one. So phase two is a little more confusing, right? And I would suspect, or I guess there's like a video online. I'll link this in the description below. But you know, in the Delphi podcast we got Jose Maria Macedo, who's helped design this. Go over. I think this is young Liebermande yeah, yeah.
00:13:37.282 - 00:14:22.476, Speaker A: Discuss how they like, why they designed it the way they did, and essentially the way like why it's so complicated is to have anti whale mechanisms. And you can check out the video if you're interested. But essentially we can do is you can either take your astro tokens and stake it into, you know, this bootstrapping pool in phase two, or take UST. So if everyone, if so, let's say hypothetically, like everyone provides Usta, right? Then let's put it into here. It usually deposits 100 UST. The pool composition after deposit is 200 USD and 100 astro, assuming that it started out with a one to one ratio. Well, in this case, the implied astro price is two USD because there's more USD in the pool than Astro.
00:14:22.476 - 00:15:27.590, Speaker A: So if a whale wanted to take like $100 million and dump it into here, then the implied astro price is going to be like, like $10 million, right? So any retail pled like you and I can take our astro tokens, dump it into here and receive I guess more USC in return, right? Because the implied, if you deposit Astro and the implied astro price is much higher, then you're going to receive more value, if that makes sense. So I wouldn't read too much into this. I would just wait until it actually comes out and then check like how the pricing is going to, how the pricing is going to be, but the way they design it like this. So I guess the Astro draw can have, can have more fair price discovery instead of just like relying on whales like, you know, nuke the price or just pump the price to some insane levels and whatnot. So, you know, I'll provide a link in the description for this video because, you know, they really thought hard and deep about this, right? I mean it's their jobs and I mean they're really good at what they do. So that being said, let's kind of move over to the next topic, which is Luna X by stator labs. So this is going to come out, I believe pretty soon actually.
00:15:27.590 - 00:16:18.298, Speaker A: But this is going to be a liquid staking derivative for Luna. So essentially if you take your luna, you stake it on terra station, you can't really do anything with that luna, right? I mean, it's kind of locked in there and if you want to take that luna out, you have to wait 21 days to unbond. Yada yada yada yada yada yada. But Luna X with stater Labs is going to introduce a liquid derivative for staking, which is pretty interesting. Essentially what you can do is you can take your Luna, stake it through stater labs and then you can use that Luna X in terra finance like defi protocols. So we can do is you can mint Luna X by staking with the liquidity pool and then it's going to be like a USD where it, where Luna X is going to appreciate in value against Luna, right? So when you do this, you're still eligible for airdrops and you can be, and you can use Luna X to, you know, leverage Luna X to borrow Luna several times. Like leverage Luna.
00:16:18.298 - 00:17:08.406, Speaker A: That's interesting. You can just leverage Luna X, right, and borrow USD, right, while still receiving airdrops and like staking rewards and whatnot. You can probably like take Luna X and bond it or, sorry, pair it with Luna, right? So Luna X, Luna and do it, provide liquidity in a liquidity pool to earn fees and whatnot so you know, I'm pretty Bullish. Like liquid staking, right? There's lido for Ethereum, there's Benki introducing liquid Avax on the Avlanche ecosystem. And now Stato is introducing liquid, I guess, staked Luna on the terra ecosystem. I'm Bullish this simple aspect just because if you can use your staked assets as collateral or like, you know, provide liquidity with it, it's going to unlock a bunch of liquidity for the entire ecosystem which is going to make the entire ecosystem usable, I guess. And it's going to boost the TVL of that particular ecosystem.
00:17:08.406 - 00:17:33.896, Speaker A: So and in the future you're going to, you can integrate this with anchor and whatnot. And this is going to. It's going to be done. But the audit is going to be done by the first week of December. So you know, this week hopefully, and maybe it's going to launch like maybe later this month or like January, whatnot. But after the full audit, you can stake your Luna with them and then form some stator tokens. Maybe it's something you're interested in.
00:17:33.896 - 00:18:03.248, Speaker A: Like me personally, I'm just like more focused on Astro because I'm actually bullish. The price of Astro, if you look at the price of all coins in terra ecosystem, they just go down, right? Because everyone wants to buy Luna, right? Luna. The Luna tokenomics are way too strong. So like people don't really like care to hold any other altcoin. I have some with my airdropped Psi tokens I provide a liquidity and it's like, it's like down like 80% or something. So down money there. But I mean, it was an airdrop, but you know, it's still kind of sad, but it is what it is.
00:18:03.248 - 00:18:26.186, Speaker A: And you know, this, this entire narrative for terra I think will continue. I think December isn't like oh my God, astroport, and then January is gonna be like oh my God, Mars. And you know, though Luna has underperformed, I still think it's gonna, you know, go into some upward price discovery. I think $100 is reasonable. Similar to how I thought, you know, $100 was reasonable for Avax back in the day. So look out for Luna. Super bullish terra.
00:18:26.186 - 00:18:55.932, Speaker A: I'm biased, but you know, it is what it is. Okay, now let's go over the phantom ecosystem because I think the next most logical rotation is ftm. Right? And don't get me wrong, like, I don't have some crazy magic. Like crazy, like what is this? Like magic eight ball telling you this? And the way I value these things, right. The way I value these l ones is like based off of, I guess, comparing it to the valuation of other l ones. So the benchmark I often use is tezos. Right.
00:18:55.932 - 00:19:17.700, Speaker A: Because, I mean, I don't hate tazos, right? I just, like, don't use tazos. So, like, I'm like, why? Why is this thing worth so much? But I have often mentioned that I believe that the floor, the resistance. Sorry. The support level of Phantom's evaluation is that of tezos. And I believe, like, I think, like a week ago, this, like, was at 5 billion. This was at 4.5 billion.
00:19:17.700 - 00:19:50.376, Speaker A: So I was like, okay, like, the risk reward is way too good. So, you know, I've been accumulating Phantom recently, and I still think it's going to do relatively well in terms of catalysts coming up. They don't really have that many catalysts just because, you know, the Phantom foundation doesn't really spend that much money marketing. Right? Like avalanche, they spend a lot of money marketing. So, you know, it gets a lot of people's attention. But Phantom, even though it is a pretty good ecosystem, it doesn't really get the attention that they deserve. So let's kind of go over the DeFi llama and look at, I guess, the TVL, right? So FTM, roughly $5.5
00:19:50.376 - 00:20:33.106, Speaker A: billion on market cap polygon at $5 billion. Right? And polygon is over two. Is over two x the valuation of FTM. And I'm not saying phantom is gonna flip Polygon, right? I think Polygon deserves a premium just because they're trying to do roll ups for ethereum L2. But, you know, I'm just saying that, hey, like FTM, it's like, it's a pretty good ecosystem, it's a thriving ecosystem, and it's still like, like relatively cheap, right? And this is definitely bull market thinking, but, you know, it's worked before. And when it comes to, like, chasing trends or, like, writing trends, I feel like you should ride the trend until the trend proves you otherwise or until the market tells you otherwise. Instead of trying to impose your will on the markets and be like, yeah, right now Ethereum is going to outperform.
00:20:33.106 - 00:21:09.694, Speaker A: I'm going to go all in Ethereum, right? Instead of saying that, like, why don't you just, like, look at the chart, listen to the markets, and kind of evaluate what the market is telling you, and then evaluate that way. For me personally, I just kind of approach the markets from more of a conservative standpoint and then be pleasantly surprised when the markets go up a lot. I think that kind of thinking is much better, especially at this stage of the cycle, because I don't think we're early in the cycle. I don't think we're super late into the cycle, but I think we're closer to the 6th inning than we are in the third inning. Right. And I've been saying that for a while now. So, phantom, good ecosystem.
00:21:09.694 - 00:21:51.866, Speaker A: I farm there, like, all the time, and the one catalyst I didn't want to go over is this announcement, right? And remember, this guy, like, this guy literally pumped the price of FTM and, like, nothing really happened. But the thing is, like, I don't think this guy is lying, right? I'm sure. I mean, he has, like, what, like, 500, like, half a million followers, right? So I'm sure he gets a bunch of inside information and he calls himself plan C. So, like, you know, I don't know if I should take him seriously, but, you know, I don't necessarily think this guy is lying. And it kind of makes logical sense for FTM to be listed on Coinbase, whether that's this month, in December, January, February, it's still going to be a positive catalyst. And you might be wondering, like, isn't Coinbase listing a sell the news? Not really. Right.
00:21:51.866 - 00:22:02.882, Speaker A: I mean, of course, if the price is pumping into the Coinbase listing, it's going to be sell the news. Right. Avax was in the short term, sell the news. Right. It pumped into the Coinbase listing and then dumped. Right. But eventually it went up.
00:22:02.882 - 00:22:13.818, Speaker A: Right. And I'm sure it's going to go higher. So FTM, similarly, like, I think. When, when did this guy tweet? October 16. Right. This guy's like, oh. He's like, all right, like, October 16.
00:22:13.818 - 00:22:31.322, Speaker A: Oh, my God, you know, Coinbase soon. Bam. It didn't happen. Bam. But I'm sure that, you know, if it does happen and when it does happen, and if Coinbase allows direct withdrawals from f. From coin, from the centralized exchange onto the FTM mainnet, it's going to be. It's a bullish catalyst, right.
00:22:31.322 - 00:22:55.410, Speaker A: Because right now, to bridge the phantom, you either have to go through, like, Kucoin binance. And if you're in the US, you can't really use binance, I believe. So you have to go through Ethereum main, you have to go through avalanche. It's a pain, right. So if you can. If a centralized exchange like Coinbase can allow for direct withdrawals, I think it's gonna be a bullish catalyst for the TVL of the ecosystem. Right? Wait, is it strong? Right, the TVL of the ecosystem.
00:22:55.410 - 00:23:27.290, Speaker A: And you know, I'm not like buying FTM because Coinbase listings too, but it's one of the reasons why I think from a risk reward standpoint, given the valuation of phantom is near that of Tezos, I think the risk reward is decent. And for me, I don't really care about catching the bottom. Right. I'm just like positioning myself for a potential rotation. And when it comes to investing in trading and just farming in general, it's all about managing risk reward. And I think the risk reward for phantom is pretty decent. Let's kind of go over some forms on Phantom.
00:23:27.290 - 00:23:57.518, Speaker A: Let me connect it. Yeah, there you go. So obviously, one is Geist. This is the premier money market, I guess, for Phantom. I'm sure Avia is coming soon, probably not anytime soon, but right now, in the meantime, Geist is the safest and it has the highest TVL. So you can take your phantom, you can take bitcoin eth, use it as collateral, borrow stable coins against it, be paid to do so. Obviously, like, these tokens are vested over three months, and if you want to claim your tokens, you have to slash 50% of it.
00:23:57.518 - 00:24:32.116, Speaker A: But even if you slash your rewards immediately, you're still getting paid to borrow. So I still think it's a pretty interesting protocol. And that's good, I think. Beethoven, this is app beats fi. This is a balancer fork. The balancer team publicly supported them as an official balancer fork, so I consider them to be a safe protocol. And when it comes to auto confounders or, sorry, being a liquidity provider, you can take FTM and Dai, right, take a 50 50 ratio, provide liquidity and earn 77%.
00:24:32.116 - 00:25:06.438, Speaker A: Or if you don't want to deal with impermanent loss, you can go here, Phantom of the Opera, and be a liquidity provider. 70% with Phantom and 30% USDC. So you're going to be taking on less impermanent loss risk. And the APR is 38%. And if you want to auto compound this, right, you can go to Reaper farm and maybe go here, right? I mean, Reaper farm, they were exploited once, right? And the UI is kind of, kind of janky. So it definitely approached this from, from a more conservative standpoint. However, I'm just bringing this up because Reaper, you know, they're currently working on a token, whatever that means.
00:25:06.438 - 00:25:42.270, Speaker A: Our audit is scheduled for the middle of December, so maybe they already took snapshots, like, I don't know. But if you want to speculate on a potential airdrop for current grim, sorry, current reperform users. Maybe it's worth it, right? But I mean, at the end of the day, I mean if you look at the market cap of auto compounder tokens, they just like don't do well, right? I feel like if you do, I mean, even if you do get this radio drop, it's not gonna be worth that much. Like, no offense to reaper team, but it's just what it is, right? I'm just calling a spade a spade. But you know, pretty decent. I think beats is an interesting form. I think it's underrated.
00:25:42.270 - 00:26:15.850, Speaker A: The beats token. They don't a parmidam token for now, but you know, interesting place to farm for sure. And lastly, I mean, I feel like I always have to talk about Defi kingdoms, so I'm sorry for anyone that's tired of me talking about defi kingdoms. However, I still think Defi kingdoms. I don't know why it's not working. Can I switch to harmony? Let me refresh here. I think people underestimate the jewel form, like heavily.
00:26:15.850 - 00:27:07.982, Speaker A: Let me, let me turn off the volume. It's pretty loud. Okay, there you go. So what you can do in the jewel form, right, defi kingdoms obviously is that you can provide liquidity for Joule and other l one tokens such as Avax earn 850% Matic 840% 1840% Luna 800% ftm roughly 100%. And I feel like people are underestimating these farms, right? And sure, like, most of these tokens are locked. However, like I'm like very, very bullish this token. And if you want more passive exposure to, or I guess less like not passive, but if you want, I don't know, a risk managed position as a farmer, I feel like, you know, taking Joule FTm, pairing it being liquidity fighter accumulate jewel can't be a bad strategy, right? I'm a fan of it.
00:27:07.982 - 00:27:40.268, Speaker A: Right? I'm not doing this right because I just like own a bunch of Luna. I'm not gonna like bridge it over here, I'm not gonna deal with it, and I'm gonna use most of my Luna for the astral core airdrop and fTm. I mean, I'm in some form, so I don't move it here, but you know, just bringing it as a potential way to gain exposure on these l one tokens and still farm with them. Right. I think matic is underrated as well. So that being said, in conclusion, Luna FTm, I think it looks strong, right? I like avalanche, but I think they need some time for consolidation. I'd be happily.
00:27:40.268 - 00:28:08.562, Speaker A: I mean, I'm happy to be wrong, but I mean, the chart looks parabolic and the ETH BTC narrative, right. Remember the BTC narrative, right, of like, oh, BTC is about to take over the markets. And don't get me wrong, I was. I also said that, right? And I'm coping as a result of people because BTC hasn't really done anything. Luckily, I can use BTC as collateral on Aave and borrow against it in form. But, you know, being a BTC, Maxi has not paid anyone, right. So I think Eth can do well.
00:28:08.562 - 00:28:24.374, Speaker A: Right. The ETH BTC chart looks very, very strong. However, you know, I wouldn't get too caught up in the narrative of, oh, ETh is about to take over the markets. All in Eth. And, yeah, there you go. I mean, ETh bitcoin is my number one position in my portfolio. Eat is my number two position portfolio.
00:28:24.374 - 00:28:45.718, Speaker A: So I'm always. I'd be happily. I mean, I'll be happy if I, if I'm proven wrong, but, you know, I wouldn't sleep on the l one narratives for this bull market. I think the L1 narrative is super strong. I think it's going to keep continuing at some point, it's. It's not going to make sense, right? You can't, you can't just keep pumping these l ones and do these rotations. But I still think they're.
00:28:45.718 - 00:28:49.110, Speaker A: I still think there is more room to go. So thank you guys for watching and have fun farming out there.
