00:01:43.974 - 00:02:09.788, Speaker A: Breaking news. Yes, it's breaking news. Samurai wallet website samuraiwallet.com has been seized by the United States District Court for the Southern District Court of New York, the United States attorney's office for. Yeah, anyway, FBI is on the case. This just happened. There's a few spaces going lock space, obviously going to cover it.
00:02:09.788 - 00:02:18.144, Speaker A: It's very timely. It's kind of a, kind of, not a kind of a bad day for bitcoin news overall. What's up, Will? What's up, Cy for?
00:02:18.484 - 00:02:22.316, Speaker B: Hey, Charlie. Hey, Cyan.
00:02:22.340 - 00:02:54.744, Speaker A: Hey. Yeah, not a good day for, like, people who think, who care about things like bitcoin privacy, bitcoin mining pool, decentralization. Yeah. So there's a couple Twitter spaces happening right now. There's the kind of the title Samurai devs arrested Twitter space. And you were just on that side. You were chatting with some of the more privacy focused people in the bitcoin ecosystem.
00:02:54.744 - 00:02:57.824, Speaker A: What's the atmosphere like right now?
00:02:59.564 - 00:03:37.944, Speaker C: Surprisingly, our base seems to be really positive overall. I mean, obviously, this is a terrible thing to have happen to anybody in the ecosystem, but there was talk discussing potentially creating a, like, privacy legal fund, which a privacy focused legal fund in bitcoin is great alignment with the rest of the ecosystem, as well as generically covering a couple of the things you can do as a potential user affected by this. You know, how to safely retain or you, you know, regain privacy that you may have lost by due to the government's actions and attacks.
00:03:38.104 - 00:03:51.684, Speaker A: Yeah. So we'll, we'll dig into that here in a second, but I will shout out, Will, who? One of the first people through the gate on this. Will, you're. We're really leaning into our breaking tweet format here.
00:03:52.624 - 00:04:22.174, Speaker B: I think it's like an accepted format on twitter.com dot. People used to hate on it, but it's like a good signaling tool. Yeah, this is one of those days in, like, bitcoin's history where you just get a sinking feeling in your stomach. So I saw this in a telegram chat and immediately was just, like, frustrated by it. We've had the same right guys on the mining pod. I've spoken with them over the last few years for lots of different reporting, whether I was at coindesk or just, like, a bitcoin hobbyist or investor, whatever.
00:04:22.174 - 00:05:23.952, Speaker B: So to see, like, their names associated with this is just, it's, like, unfathomably awful and what's going to happen to them and their families over the next few years as they kind of go through litigation. We saw the same thing happen with tornado cash last year and around August and then even previously before that also awful situation. Spoke a lot with tornado cash guys when they were launching, I wrote the piece for Coindesk when they were launching that protocol in 2020 when they went forward with the token afterwards. Both, both camps here have just been on the wrong side of the law in the sense that the law does not like privacy and will attack privacy. I saw a great tweet from bullyask, who's a great twitter follow. His basic point was like, there's never going to be a open ability to have privacy on bitcoin because government will want access to a transparent ledger and so they'll go after these guys every single time. That being said, most people in crypto, I'd say 99% of people want some sort of privacy or better privacy.
00:05:23.952 - 00:05:35.444, Speaker B: And so we get typically, like these few people who just get screwed over. We all want it. Only a few people can make this. People who do make it end up in jail or in prison or in litigation.
00:05:37.224 - 00:06:25.870, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, if you go to the web, if you go to the samurai.com or samuraiwallet.com, you can see it's got the classic, you know, terrifying, shocking, this website has been seized banner on it from the FBI and Internal Revenue Service, and it's got the names of everybody, Portugal, Judiciary police, Europol, icelandic police, and yeah, not a good sign here. The, you know, I've, while we were kind of teeing up for this, I noticed that the actual docs, samurai IO, is still up. I would recommend anybody watching this immediately go and just start downloading and backing up anything samurai related. There's been a few calls to action here already, actually.
00:06:25.870 - 00:06:41.914, Speaker A: I think Sai you might have some insight to this. I heard Shinobi with bitcoin magazine making a point on this. Can you kind of reiterate, given that this is a timely situation, can you kind of reiterate, like, what, what the call to action was here from Shinobi and other privacy advocates?
00:06:42.594 - 00:08:12.034, Speaker C: Yeah. So docs are great, but most of their GitLab, in fact, just their GitLab in general, which is where they keep their code that backs a lot of this, including the tooling that controls whirlpool, is no longer available. So any developer that had a recent version of that should definitely be making sure that they create a good backup of it and potentially disseminating that, because code is freedom of speech and allowing code to be taken down is counterintuitive to the idea of maximalizing freedom. I do want to make a quick note on the website seizure, you will notice that unlike most traditional website seizures that you've seen in the past, there's a lot of new and interesting names being put together in new and creative ways. So we've seen Europol and IR's before, maybe not IRSCI specifically, but we've seen those two combined. But to see both the icelandic police specifically regarding the domain registrar and portugal mentioned here indicates that this is a joint operation between both the US and EU, which indicates a sense of scale a little bit different than one government choosing to be authoritarian and starts to bridge into a multinational or even multi regional effort to undermine privacy.
00:08:14.814 - 00:08:45.974, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, I haven't dug deep into the previous, like, seizures like this. I mean, I don't know in what way this mirrors the tornado cache seizure and imprisonment. I mean, I know that, you know, that story has not fully resolved yet and is still ongoing. And I know that wasn't the one of the developers for tornado cache, like, sentenced to multiple years. Am I remembering this correctly?
00:08:46.274 - 00:09:20.958, Speaker B: Somewhat. So the details a little fuzzy for me as well. So if you're listening this, I encourage you to do your own research, but this is just from memory and having kind of been around like the whole Toronto cache story. They launched a protocol, I believe, like a V 120 19 or so, V 220 20. They launched token, the torn token, a little bit later, they received a lot of criticism for launching the torn token because it's like, well, this is supposed to be like a privacy protocol. Why do you need token associated with it? They had their reasons for it. A lot of people thought it might be like a way for the government to attack Tornado cash is actually to have the torrent token there.
00:09:20.958 - 00:09:58.644, Speaker B: Doesn't seem like that's actually what the government really cared about. Because in August of 2023, believe was when this happened, there was a joint action with the dutch enforcement arm. I think Interpol was somehow involved and then us prosecutors and yeah, they sent out charges and arrest warrants for basically three people involved with that. Roman Surmov who believe is now Dubai citizen. I think he's of russian origin, but I believe this is in Dubai. Spoken with Roman for great guy, really well loved in the bitcoin community or Ethereum community. And then there's two other people who were also charged.
00:09:58.644 - 00:10:25.004, Speaker B: I think one was arrested because they were in Oregon at the time, and then the second was arrested because they were in the Netherlands. These. Alexi Pursoff was the person in the Netherlands and he was just impounded for 90 days without any access to anything, wasn't even formally charged. They just put him in prison for 90 days. And then they kept extending it, booting it down the line. I'm not sure where it's at right now. I believe he's at home arrest as of now.
00:10:25.004 - 00:11:07.410, Speaker B: So like the story there, of course, just mimics what we're seeing here now. Tornado Cash has been or not tornado cash, samurai wallet has been using the bitcoin community for quite a while. Probably one of my earliest follows and bitcoin was a samurai guys, just because like they're known for spicy takes, they didn't take bullshit from anyone. They gave you their thoughts on things. Well known beef with Wasabi, another privacy mixer, quote unquote. And now you're here in 2024, us government doesn't like them and so they're sees their domain, sees their servers. Probably have taken a lot of information on the back end of this, which I want to boot oversight, and ask you about that.
00:11:07.410 - 00:11:50.894, Speaker B: We saw that tornado cash where you were not able to use tornado cash anymore. You could still use a smart contract technically, because it was a mutable smart contract on the ethereum network, but you're not able to use the front end UI website. And then also any tokens that had come from tornado cash at any time were considered tainted by the us government. And so there was even some lawsuits from like bankless and Coinbase and a few others saying, like, we should still be able to use our assets that had touched tornado cash at one point because you can't show that these are actually like tainted assets. Wondering if there's any like privacy implications for people who have used bitcoin through mixing service, whether it be samurai wallet or not.
00:11:51.874 - 00:12:29.634, Speaker C: Yeah. So on tornado cash specifically, it is important to note that approximately three weeks ago, roman storm actually moved to have his case thrown out. So that's still, I believe in ongoing litigation. And that's important to note that the timing is rather interesting. I don't know if they're hoping that a conviction on one case leads to a conviction on the other, or at least having multiple cases. Processing gives them the ability to drag both of them out, increasing costs to the individual. Well, the government gets to settle it upon all the taxpayers.
00:12:29.634 - 00:13:21.074, Speaker C: As for the technical side of this, tornado cash was the smart contract. There was a tornado cash front end that was obviously taken down as you stated, and you could still use tornado cash directly with smart contract if you know what you were doing. And then multiple alternative front ends popped up on tor and other privacy focused protocols with this. So obviously the coordinator, the bit that decides where things are being sent to and Samurai's setup is down. But because of the design, you're never actually handing over custody to samurai. So your funds are still completely under your control in this whole process. So no loss of funds, barring any abnormalities.
00:13:21.074 - 00:14:10.674, Speaker C: And then as for identifying these funds, well, you may be able to probabilistically say that these are this because of the nature of there not being an on chain contract that you can see who, who made calls to it, you'll be able to better mask this. And the current operating theory is unless you use their, their dojo node in the last say, month, because we don't know how long they've been being monitored or potentially even, you know, under this, this sealed indictment. But assuming you weren't in that range, your X pubs were cached, not stored, allegedly. So there's a chance that you may not even be exposed as far as an X pub.
00:14:11.774 - 00:14:27.114, Speaker A: And yeah, and again for the, maybe the ordinals, newbies who are listening to the show who listen maybe for more ordinals content. What is an Xpub? How does this fit into and how are addresses derived from an xpub?
00:14:28.034 - 00:15:25.024, Speaker C: Yeah, so the Xpub is, you may have noticed in bitcoin you have access to all these addresses. Traditional bitcoiners will remind you again and again, rightfully so, that you should avoid address reuse, use an address once, avoid, you know, looping back into previously used addresses. This all contributes to your privacy. When operating in bitcoin, the Xpub can be used to see all the addresses that you control with the private key that you have. Doesn't give them any sort of control over it, but it would let them identify that all of this range of addresses is you. So if you've used a privacy enhancing service, some sort of coin join, including Samurai's service, this would potentially undermine that and set you right back at the original security assumption and privacy assumptions that you started at. Again, you should treat it as if it's compromised if you were using samurai because good privacy practices.
00:15:25.024 - 00:15:35.344, Speaker C: But as of right now, it's appearing that most of these will not have been compromised, especially if you were operating your own node, specifically their node software, dojo.
00:15:38.284 - 00:16:24.382, Speaker A: Yeah. So when you do these mixing, you hand your xpub that is used to help coordinate or the outputs of that mixing mix all the inputs and all the outputs. We use the XPub to basically figure out where some of the output should go. So there has to be some kind of coordinating mechanism here so in such a case, an entity which had been monitoring this at the time could during that period, identify some of the, and connect some of the outputs of those inputs. So that is a risk. But you're saying that again, it's almost always the case with privacy tech. The more of your own full stack you run and use this Ronin dojo as an example here.
00:16:24.382 - 00:16:40.262, Speaker A: That might not open you up to risk. Can you explain to me just kind of basically why using your own, the Ronin Dojo product that they offered might not expose you to xpub? Reveal?
00:16:40.438 - 00:17:10.274, Speaker C: Yeah. So if you were utilizing it as a light wallet, you're connecting to their server, which means their server needs the xpub to be able to identify if payments in the Utxo set were for you. If you're running it on your own node, you no longer need to provide that xpub to anyone else. So therefore they only see the addresses that are used when they're coordinating actual transactions, which greatly reduces your exposure in this sort of a situation.
00:17:16.034 - 00:17:41.844, Speaker B: I wanted to bring up this tweet and get your reaction to it. So there was obviously like a lot of back and forth in the bitcoin community over like Wasabi or samurai or other coin join methods. And this one from bitcoin mechanic, he just posted a second ago. Any takes on this? On the method for using the method used by samurai versus others and pushback on their method?
00:17:44.144 - 00:18:38.820, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, this is nuanced. I don't know. I don't like to call people spooks publicly, but I will say that samurai is well known to the community as being very, very spicy. They are going to, they're kind of, they're going to fire in every direction. This is a personality trait a lot of like privacy advocates and very like independent opinion people have. So they're going to, they're going to direct, you know, anger and I think, um, I think I would say mechanics, criticism of the, of that particular technical, uh, uh, attack surface area is probably justified. That doesn't mean, um, that it's a honey pot or it's in bad actorship.
00:18:38.820 - 00:18:47.944, Speaker A: I think this is more just downstream of the fact that bitcoin has certain structural issues against being good at privacy. Anna but what about you? Si?
00:18:48.244 - 00:19:42.114, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd largely agree. We have a little bit of challenges with regards to privacy because it is a network graph, which is very traditional, like tooling if you were trying to do any sort of data analysis. But. Well, the take is not wrong. Obviously sending your xpub to anyone else is probably a bad idea. If you're trying to maximize privacy, it's important to note that was if you were using it as a light wallet and expecting to not run a node. So it's a really tough spot where he's not wrong in that we shouldn't be doing this, but he is wrong in implying that there is a perfect solution to it without, you know, drastically redesigning the way these systems work.
00:19:42.114 - 00:19:53.434, Speaker C: And we're going to get there, I'm sure, eventually. Eventually you'll combine your X pub and then dump set of addresses or something, or everybody would run their own node. In a perfect world.
00:19:57.274 - 00:20:18.378, Speaker B: Yeah. It is kind of wild for me to see, like, shots taken like this, right when something like this happens. It's not uncommon for bitcoin maxis to pull something like this. I think it's a. It's a pretty sad day for everyone who's involved with samurai. And whether you like the setup or not, I think it's just unfortunate Charlie, in it to you, though, because I think you're going to kind of take the conversation elsewhere.
00:20:18.506 - 00:21:03.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, yeah, this is one of those things where you got to consider not just what happened today, but kind of where we came from. The samurai guys go back to the. Back to a lot of the privacy and bitcoin cash software discussions early 15 and maybe 16. I think they implemented bit 47, if I'm not mistaken, which was the Anim or that was a privacy focused address bip. And they've been kind of a bit contrarian for a long time. So, you know, we did do a great interview with samurai during the ocean pool censoring discussions in December. That might be, if you're listening to this, go back and go to the mining pod.
00:21:03.874 - 00:22:21.794, Speaker A: It's December 8, 2023. That'd be a good listen to will and I enjoyed our conversation with the samurai guys. Samurai Dev. So on that note, I did mention pools, which brings us to the other kind of, like, not very uplifting narrative of the day. If you've been paying attention to the mining pod and our newsletter, and you've seen us talk about some of the public research that's been put forwards about this topic, of suggesting that mining pools are more concentrated, or at least more interlinked than most people understood. The famous mining pool distribution where you have foundry ant pool, f two binance via and so on, those being distinct pools may not be the full story. And we've seen Parker Merritt in particular, where we talked about on the mining pod, demonstrate with some coinmetrics research that a lot of the payouts for many of the pools are provably linked and going to the same custodian.
00:22:21.794 - 00:23:30.182, Speaker A: And that kicked off some other tweets and discussion from Mononaut, who's with mempool out space. And then most recently, I think the real strong association, which is public, is from bitcoin researcher Oxb ten C. I wish I'd pulled up the tweet here. I can find it in a sec. Which takes a look at the actual block template construction and identifies that almost certainly a number of pools have identical, in fact arguably the same block template constructor, which basically means that these pools are all really just one pool. And he goes into this again, it gets a little mathy, a little merkle tree merkel proofy, I think, but it's uncanny. But basically, today, one of the biggest newsletters in bitcoin, especially in the hardcore bitcoiner camp, Marty Bent with the, with his newsletter bent.
00:23:30.182 - 00:24:05.492, Speaker A: And on the subsequent episode of Tales from the Crypt, TFTC, he had a conversation with Matt Corrallo on pool centralization on this topic. And I kind of thrust this, this narrative into the mainstream discourse. So everybody's talking about it. It's now no longer kind of a weird side conversation. Again, if you've been listening to us the past two or three months, we have been talking about this. So why are you not subscribed to Block Space newsletter? Going to shill it out here. But yeah, that's a bit of a summary.
00:24:05.492 - 00:24:12.144, Speaker A: Will or cypher, what do you want to add as far as intro and exposition on this particular subject?
00:24:12.884 - 00:24:17.064, Speaker B: I think we could throw it in to the clip and then go from there. Unless I have something.
00:24:18.844 - 00:24:38.464, Speaker C: No, just a real high level reminder that cooperation between mining pools in almost any form is advantageous for the network as a whole. Just contextually, it's a good thing to keep in mind. You typically do not want your miners choosing to collaborate.
00:24:40.284 - 00:24:47.784, Speaker A: Yeah, I've tried to pull up a clip. I haven't fully listened to it, but you get the idea probably from this minute or so.
00:25:04.024 - 00:25:05.520, Speaker B: I think we're missing the audio there.
00:25:05.552 - 00:25:11.864, Speaker A: Okay, we don't have the auto audio. I can. I can basically voice over for Marty. So I'll talk a little bit slower.
00:25:11.984 - 00:25:14.152, Speaker B: I could pull it over too. What's your time stamp?
00:25:14.328 - 00:25:17.866, Speaker A: It's two minutes and 8 seconds.
00:25:18.040 - 00:25:20.194, Speaker B: Two minutes and 8 seconds.
00:25:20.534 - 00:25:21.854, Speaker A: So bear with us.
00:25:21.974 - 00:25:24.470, Speaker B: Oh, I almost nailed it perfectly on the first click.
00:25:24.582 - 00:25:25.274, Speaker A: Nice.
00:25:26.414 - 00:25:29.702, Speaker B: I was watching this earlier. So how's that sound?
00:25:29.758 - 00:26:37.294, Speaker D: Bad things are good, particularly at the mining pool layer. So this is a tweet from ox b ten c has done a great job of analyzing the bitcoin blockchain and particularly keeping an eye on mining pools to see what theyre up to, how theyre constructing blocks. And him and mononaut from mempool space have been sounding the alarm that it looks like. If you look at the Merkel branches that mining pools send to miners as part of their stratum jobs, its clear that the btc.com pool, binance pool, pool in EMCD raw pool and possibly brainstorming have exactly the same template and custom transaction prioritization as ant pool. So this equates to about 50% of the mining hashrate as represented by mining pools, essentially handling how blocks are constructed and the payouts as well. So this dictates payouts from a central party as well.
00:26:37.994 - 00:26:43.690, Speaker E: Yeah. So basically they're all the same pool from the perspective of bitcoin. These are all the same.
00:26:43.722 - 00:26:44.334, Speaker B: Cool.
00:26:45.754 - 00:26:46.694, Speaker D: Not good?
00:26:47.274 - 00:27:08.070, Speaker E: No, no, it's not good. So, I mean, I think it's. So it's important to kind of point out why this is a problem. I think. So bitcoin's value proposition, I would argue, and I hope not so controversially argue, is that it is a censorship resistant money.
00:27:08.222 - 00:27:08.558, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:08.606 - 00:27:44.148, Speaker E: That, or more colloquially bitcoin is fuck you money. It is money that I can control, that you can't stop me from using however I see fit. It is freedom money. And that comes from censorship resistance that comes from this concept of I can send the money wherever I want and there's no entity or no group of entities that can stop me. And the answer right now is it's clearly not true. There's one pool that has near 50% of hash power. Throughout all of bitcoin's history, we've had a lot of centralization in pools.
00:27:44.148 - 00:28:01.224, Speaker E: So obviously pools ensure that miners get stable rewards and miners want this. And it's really important for the business of a lot of miners, but they also select the transactions, they also select what goes into the bitcoin blockchain and they can censor.
00:28:01.944 - 00:28:02.304, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:02.344 - 00:28:15.044, Speaker E: And so there being a large pool that's nearing 50%, that's getting to the point where they could completely censor the bitcoin blockchain if they wanted to, just by their own decision making should frighten everyone.
00:28:17.704 - 00:28:21.136, Speaker B: There's a weed whacker outside me, so I'm going to let you guys take this.
00:28:21.320 - 00:28:24.004, Speaker A: No. Cypher, go and weed whack this topic.
00:28:24.744 - 00:29:32.726, Speaker C: Sounds good. So obviously, anybody looking at the mempool on a very frequent basis to include people like Mononau, as a token public example, has been watching this for months where transaction or Coinbase transaction construction in particular, was showing signs of potential centralization. This includes certain metaprotocol addresses being overlapped in unique ways where they were being using the same address between multiple. We're going to refer to them, I guess, as logical pools to avoid any insinuation. Otherwise, combined with potentially sharing payout addresses where things are being routed, potentially one hop deep into the same effective accounts at the back end of everything. All these were very concerning to a lot of us, but there wasn't the research yet publicly to say conclusively if this was happening. So now that we do have that public source of truth, to say with absolute certainty that like, there is a.
00:29:32.726 - 00:30:15.614, Speaker C: Not a certainty, sorry, but a probabilistic proof, I should say, that these. That we have a set of pools that are collaborating very, very useful. And it ends up tying back in very, very well to evidence we'd already been looking at with regards to heuristics like empty blocks, with heuristics like where payments were flowing. And again, third party metaprotocols that were being included in the Coinbase transactions. And then to kind of piggyback on exactly what he was saying in that clip. This is a very undesirable characteristic. I often say mining pools are an evil, depending on who you ask.
00:30:15.614 - 00:30:35.954, Speaker C: They're a necessary evil for capital efficiency. If this is what mining pools become, then they become an absolute evil that, you know, we have, has to be dealt with in bitcoin. How you go about that, we've never had to even consider. But, you know, maybe it's closer on the horizon than we ever would have hoped against.
00:30:42.814 - 00:31:33.244, Speaker A: It's been kind of a dark day in. In the bitcoin story because, you know, the past year has really been dominated by considerable levity. Like, yeah, it's been, I would say, overall kind of fun disarming conversation about the whole shitcoins on bitcoin thing. It's been fun that we've been having a largely positive discussion about fees generated to bitcoin miners and post having this. This fee pulse and right now, interesting, like, profitability parity post having for miners. But today is kind of the opposite, where we get hit on two fronts, which is the narrative on block production. Centralization rears its head, enters the mainstream discourse, and then also bitcoin takes a big privacy blow.
00:31:33.244 - 00:32:13.466, Speaker A: Where do we go from here? Does the. Does this stuff get solved? Like, I believe Matt Corallo on TFTC. And Matt's one of the most OG core contributors and one of the most figurehead people in the bitcoin developer space for a decade now. Matt said, quote, I think I, I think bitcoin has a less than 5% chance of succeeding. What? I mean, Charlie Spears does not agree with this, but also, you know, he is one of the most prominent, respected voice in the space. What, how does that sit with you?
00:32:13.490 - 00:33:21.964, Speaker C: Sigh it depends on how you define bitcoin is succeeding. If it hit, if we're saying, will it hit all these lofty goals that we believe it is capable of and last for another 200 years? Honestly, I would still pursue it. If we said that the percentage was half of that, I'd still say it's a valuable endeavor. If we say that bitcoin is going to die in the next six months, then that percentage is orders of magnitude too low. Bitcoins ability to survive through. I mean, bitcoin is the cockroach of tech in that you can take entire countries off of the power grid, off of their power grids and off of communications, and bitcoin will still continue to chug along like a train that just doesn't care about anything else on the tracks. So I would depend, I would say it depends on what your expectations for bitcoin are in terms of time scale and in terms of societal network, all these other useful effects that we desire from this technology.
00:33:23.064 - 00:33:59.168, Speaker B: I want to jump in and give a miners perspective, though. So if you listen to the rest of the show with Matt and Marty, Matt goes into a lot of like, things that he thinks miners are not doing correctly. And he points out that miners are self motivated, profit motivated, and they're doing things that are best for their business, but that might come into clash with bitcoin. What's best for bitcoin. Right. So we have like an agency problem here. The thing though is, I think Matt's argument misses, is that just because bitcoin operates a certain way and need people to operate a certain way doesn't mean miners need to do that.
00:33:59.168 - 00:34:49.213, Speaker B: And he says multiple times within the podcast that bitcoin core developers and the developers have done everything they need to do in order to create this self sustaining system. But it's the miners fault that they haven't subscribed to the right pool model and that they're pushing bitcoin towards more centralization, which I think is sort of like the wrong setup here because yes, there are other pool payout methods, but they're not with the market demands. And so, in a sense, like, I do think there needs to be more development work to be able to understand, like, how to get these pool payouts correctly so that businesses can operate. Like, there's a reason people use fpps. There's a reason that people want, uh, that certainty and their payout method. And businesses can only operate with certainty, and so they strive for certainty. The bitcoin network, on the other hand, uh, somewhat chaotic, right? Like, there's a lot of chaos.
00:34:49.213 - 00:35:37.898, Speaker B: We even saw with the having block, right, where, like, when was it coming? And then all of a sudden we had three blocks in a row in ten minutes. Like, bitcoin is a little more chaotic. And it's difficult to design, like, this very nebulous system like bitcoin and then operate something on top of it as a business like miners do. And so I do think there needs to be better conversation between miners and developers. And I'm frankly surprised it hasn't happened yet, because some of the comments that were made there just seemed like they hadn't talked to miners anytime recently. Like, they don't understand why foundry is, uh, gave a 0% pool fee for so long and why that was so important for getting the business off the ground and how that's actually probably beneficial in terms of long term bitcoin decentralization, because now we have two large entities in two different parts of the world that are competitors. That's better than just having one large conglomerate like amp pool.
00:35:37.898 - 00:36:07.932, Speaker B: Uh, and they didn't really talk about, like, the benefits of fpps and things like that. Now, I do think, like, fpps and these things are going to die out over time. But I was again, surprised that there hasn't been better conversation between miners and developers on this, because miners, they kind of have the weight of economics behind them. They can't really change things just because bitcoin developers are calling for it. And it's not like you can just fire miners. I think that's also brought up in this podcast that miners should be fired and we should change the algo. I think that's kind of a ludicrous idea.
00:36:07.932 - 00:36:46.400, Speaker B: We've heard Luke Dasher throw that out there, happen in the Ethereum network, obviously. And that was a very common idea with ethereum developers. I was like, we can fire the miners. Whenever the, quote, ethereum was, miners are slaves, they're not workers. I think that's a wrong perspective, especially given that a lot of bitcoin miners are node runners, right? So they, they're participants in the system, and they often can be considered like the economic nodes of the network in a law center because they, they do participate in exchanges. A lot of these miners are now financialized and they have trading desks within their bitcoin mining operations. So I would say like they are kind of the economic weight of the system in a lot of ways.
00:36:46.400 - 00:37:20.026, Speaker B: And on top of that like a lot of these miners and developers are in the northern, in the western hemisphere now after the China mining ban. So why can't there be better conversations between the two camps? I don't think you can fire miners. I think that's kind of ridiculous idea though I do agree Cypher and Matt crawl here that we like need better network decentralization on the mining front side. We've been covering that in the mining pot a lot. I go check out the Parker Merritt show that we did the other week to see more details about that. It's, it's pretty freaky but I think we just need better dialogue and options.
00:37:20.210 - 00:38:36.100, Speaker A: Yeah I think one people, I think a lot of people who are talking about this, uh, I mean obviously Luke and, and Matt are the people who have like have really introduced these topics into the conversation. Just assume that minors are, are able to make snap decisions immediately based upon what a tweet they read this morning or because they're dialed into the current like absolute cutting edge discussion of bitcoin tech and that's simply just not true. Yes miners can point and redirect their hash at will at a technical sense, but there are things like there's contractual obligation. A lot of what foundry is able to do by offering 0% fees was because they were also on the financing end of the operations. So they're locked in, they've got the hashers locked into the contracts. Then also the mining industry is really optimized to build out infrastructure and to optimize for power contracts and servicing and building this infrastructure. This is not necessarily at odds, but it's not a parallel information stream as people who spend all day reading research papers on the game theory behind bitcoins incentive model.
00:38:36.100 - 00:39:45.256, Speaker A: The average bitcoin miner in my experience these days does not read the bitcoin dev mailing list, does not even know thats a thing. Probably does not know a bitcoin developer by name. They are mainly folk, but they do know their county commissioner and they probably know their regional governing body because thats what impacts their business. So I think one of the important things to come out of this is that we introduce and reintroduce these kinds of conversations back into mainstream so that we can change the information landscape for these economic actors within bitcoin's system. My view is that the game theory of bitcoin relies heavily upon the information about what the current state of bitcoins decentralization looks like. When you introduce new information to the actors in a game, they will be able to make different decisions. We saw this with g hash back in 13, I think, or 14, where when it took a little while, some pushing and pulling and gnashing of teeth, g hashing of teeth.
00:39:45.256 - 00:40:35.192, Speaker A: They had to, you know, they were able. Miners did not want to participate in that growing accrual of hashrate to a single actor. And then the other side of it is, okay, you can change the hashing algorithm. I haven't really dove deep into this idea, but this seems pretty short sighted, because, okay, you're just going to change it to a different hashing algorithm. You're just going to produce another KIng maker, you're not going to solve the problem, and you're probably just going to hand it back to the same people who are well capitalized and already producers of ASICs and Chip, and they're able to procure foundry space. So to me, that doesn't actually solve the core problem. We need to have better solutions.
00:40:35.192 - 00:41:09.824, Speaker A: Now, I think Matt actually does float a couple other good ideas, particularly reimagining how pools work. He floats the p two p pool model as well as braid pool, neither of which I'm intimately familiar with. But they are very compelling alternatives to block production and various forms of ppl and s, like profit sharing. So that's a. That's a bit of a long winded Charlie Spears soapbox, but cypher, thoughts on my rant here?
00:41:10.564 - 00:41:53.354, Speaker C: Yeah, so both what you and Wilson mentioned about miners, I think it's very important to note the only real fault of miners in this whole thing is being misled by the pools. They chose to point their hashrate at about what that pool was doing. So let's be very clear, when we, when we approach this sort of problem, the problem is not the miners. Yes, we have miners who are horrifically overexposed by borrowing in fiat to mine bitcoin. Depending on who you ask, that's either the greatest thing ever or the most evil thing ever. But at the end of the day, their only flaw in this particular problem is they went to a pool. The pool said, yes, we produce blocks.
00:41:53.354 - 00:42:47.804, Speaker C: Give us hash rate, we'll equalize, we'll make your capital less unstable, thus making your business more reliable and more likely to succeed. So no fault there. The fault falls entirely on mining pools who have chosen to act as proxies but are happily misleading customers as to their role in the ecosystem. And that is incredibly distasteful. Disregarding its network impacts on the network and all these other things. We have an industry acting as proxies that has a financial motivation to mislead miners and that. I don't know how you solve that as an industry, but that's just strictly unacceptable when we're talking about the people who are building blocks for what should be the greatest blockchain on earth.
00:42:48.544 - 00:43:29.994, Speaker B: I still don't get though, what if we have all these bitcoin developers who are normally in the western hemisphere like they're in Europe or they're in North North America, why they can't talk to bitcoin miners, that there's 30% that were cash rate. It's basically in Texas at this point or the southern US between Georgia and Texas. Why can't we have like more bitcoin developers go to bitcoin mines or bitcoin mines opening up their doors to bitcoin developers to go have these conversations? Because I don't think it's that complex, honestly. Like it's not that complex to understand. Like the pain points for miners. Like it's energy, its logistics and then its pool payout methods make sure the revenue is coming in at the correct time. I totally agree with what you're saying, Cypher.
00:43:29.994 - 00:44:00.512, Speaker B: Like a lot of these miners didn't know what they signed up for. They got something simple and then perhaps they didn't need to care or weren't willing to be educated on like the downsides of accruing hash rate to a certain pool. Or as we're seeing now what's happening. If a pool does have the ability to do more malleable transactions, how that could like potentially harm the network. But like overall I do think like we should have better conversations. Like there, there's huge meetups now where a lot of miners go to them. It's like the Houston meetup, for example.
00:44:00.512 - 00:44:06.128, Speaker B: Why don't we have better conversations? So I hope that's fixed. I hope block space can be part of the solution there.
00:44:06.296 - 00:44:35.876, Speaker A: Yeah, it's certainly a focus of ours at blockspace, mainly through our channels, the mining pod. But yeah, I mean this is an interesting era where bitcoin developer community and the bitcoin technical community has to now figure out how to convince miners of making better, you might say bitcoin aligned decisions. Our goal will weve been pretty clear about this is to try to drive forward that crossover. So what were we going to say?
00:44:35.900 - 00:45:26.490, Speaker C: Sai yeah, I think its important to note its not that developers don't want to talk to miners. If you imagine you're a miner, right, you have a fixed amount of time in your day and I come to you with a simple solution where I tell you, just plug in this stratum address and you're good to go and we solve all these problems. And I'll have you know, I'll even have a fancy pitch deck because I profit from doing this as a mining pool. Right. I have incentive to sell you on this, whereas talking to developers is not going to make your life easy, it's going to make your life much harder as a miner. You're going to have to learn more about how bitcoin works like we all have had to learn in the last year. And then on top of having to learn that, you're probably going to need realize you need to hire somebody just to manage your pool operations from the software standpoint.
00:45:26.490 - 00:46:14.262, Speaker C: I mean you, you're going to need to figure out how do I peer to all the other miners so that way when I find a block, my block doesn't get reorged because of bad peering? How do I peer to other miners in a way that under offsets things like spy mining? And then you, you get into all these really long rabbit holes of discussion. I don't, again, I don't, I don't think this is a bash on miners at all. They, they have no reason to go pursue all that. And on the development side, we failed to go sell them on how to do it better because quite frankly, I'm not sure if anybody does know how to do it better yet. Maybe that's where some time and effort and energy and resources needs to be spent. But I think miners can do miners, miners are doing the best they can do. Developers are doing the best they can do.
00:46:14.262 - 00:46:21.954, Speaker C: There is definitely an overlap that's unexplored and I would love to see that get, you know, further touched on in the next couple coming months and years.
00:46:24.494 - 00:47:15.552, Speaker A: Yep. Well, I think we're hitting 45 minutes for the stream. We're probably going to wrap this up. This is episode of Block Space Bytes, which is our opportunistic kind of summary show. We will go live with block space bytes occasionally, but we have a regular succinct 1015 minutes block space bytes episode at the top of every Monday. Make sure to subscribe to all the Block Space media newsletter going out on Monday and Fridays covering ordinals, bitcoin tech and mining, the mining pod, the number one podcast in mining, bitcoin season two and my personal favorite show, the Gork show for all things bitcoin and broader crypto discussion.

00:47:15.552 - 00:47:17.844, Speaker A: Will, what else am I missing?
00:47:19.144 - 00:47:36.350, Speaker B: I just put the link in the channel. So yeah, if you want more conversations like this, we've literally been talking about this kind of stuff for like months now. So especially on the mining pool side, the samurai stuff. Like, we've had them on the show, but that was breaking news today, obviously. I think we can wrap up from there. Thanks for tuning in. Tuning in.
