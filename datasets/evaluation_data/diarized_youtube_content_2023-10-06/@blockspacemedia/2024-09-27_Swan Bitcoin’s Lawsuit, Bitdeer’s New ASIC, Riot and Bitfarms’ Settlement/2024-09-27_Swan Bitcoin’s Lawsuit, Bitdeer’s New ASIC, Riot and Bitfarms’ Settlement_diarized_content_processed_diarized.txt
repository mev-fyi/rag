00:00:00.320 - 00:00:45.891, Speaker A: Hey, welcome back to the mining pod. Normally this is our news roundup and it will be our news roundup. But we are going to do a special part first. So this actually happened right after we were recording our news roundup. This bombshell drops. Swan Mining is suing its former executive, a CIO who's actually been on the mining pod, Raf Siguri and other third party contractors and employees of Swann for attempting to steal Swan Mining's proprietary tech stack and Swanites itself in a new lawsuit that just dropped. They called this the hell and rain fire plan that was working in concert with the other JV partner, Tether Inc.
00:00:45.891 - 00:01:06.545, Speaker A: For Swan's billion dollar bitcoin mining business. So we have this lawsuit in front of us who's actually kind of like waiting for this for a while because we heard some rumblings about this since our ears are way to the ground. But Colin first takes on this and then I will throw some thoughts out there from just reading the PACER news.
00:01:06.625 - 00:02:17.797, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think you kind of covered it a lot already. It seems like at the center of this is obviously mines Swans mining business, but they are suing Proton Management who is the company that is allegedly trying to take over their mining business and a bunch of former executives. Some of the defendants are a former investment director at Swan, a former head of business development at Swan and a few others including like I said, the Proton management. So it seems like a large contingent of Swans mining team defected to this new company and we're trying to Swan is alleging take over the entire mining operation. Now obviously there's more to this story beyond this file, this, this, this initial complaint for the lawsuit. So I'm just really curious to see how it develops. I at least first take would find it very hard to believe that these, you know, professionals and these managers at Swan, these executives did this without any sort of legal cover at all like that.
00:02:17.797 - 00:02:33.059, Speaker B: There has to be something because this is a huge thing to just leave this company, leave your current company, join another company with the intent to take over the mining operation that you've built. Of course Swan broke into mining, what was it, about a year ago kind of made it.
00:02:33.107 - 00:02:36.875, Speaker A: Yeah, they announced it about a year ago January.
00:02:36.995 - 00:03:08.739, Speaker B: But basically this attempt to move into financial services in addition to selling bitcoin to people. You know, we saw this with River 2. They were the two main Bitcoin only exchanges to kind of stand up a bitcoin mining service for their customers. So it seems like what Will is saying, this has been a long time in the making though. I just. My question is, this is such a brazen thing to do. There had to have been some justification or legal cover for these executives to leave and try to do this right.
00:03:08.739 - 00:03:16.409, Speaker B: There's more to this story. I just. We obviously don't know what that is yet. This will be developing over the next year, obviously, so be keeping a close eye on it.
00:03:16.457 - 00:04:21.505, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's the nature of the action from the PACER that just dropped the lawsuit. Over a period of several weeks in July and August, defendants and other agents hatched and executed a rain and hellfire plan to steal Swan's billion dollar Bitcoin mining business. The individual dependents, all former Swan consultants, conspired to steal Swans highly proprietary and confidential Bitcoin mining business, technology, trade secrets, property and personnel, and then resigned nearly simultaneously on the evening of August 8, 2024 to join the defendant Proton. This goes on further to describe the consultants themselves, one of them being Raf Siguri, who again we've actually had on the show when Swan Mining was first announced, a few other people, they all seem to be on the Swan Mining team, sort of like the Swan Mining executive team of some sort. And they also worked with the other JV partner in this, which is Tether, the largest stable coin by Market Cap, a stablecoin that is one of the biggest and most profitable businesses on earth right now. So it's kind of becoming a household name.
00:04:21.505 - 00:04:56.563, Speaker A: They have funded Swan in the past, which is a really interesting note about this piece. This is the first confirmation publicly of Swan and Tether working together. It's always kind of been like if you worked in the industry, you knew they worked together, but this confirms it. And it looks like these executives wanted to leave Swan for some reason and it's unclear why. There's a lot of screenshots of emails and conjecture and obviously this was Swan as the plaintiff. So they are going after their consultants as defendants here. And so it's positioned from a place that makes Swan look better.
00:04:56.563 - 00:05:11.749, Speaker A: But I'm sure there's plots on the other side. The fact that they're all resigning at the same time and trying to move over to Tether, that just seems to me like there was something else going on. And so I'm wondering if there was just like internal problems at Swan or if they're whatever like conjecture. We'll find out.
00:05:11.837 - 00:05:19.149, Speaker B: Let's not forget that isn't Swan currently. There are rumors circulating that it's bank, it's going through a bankruptcy. Right. Is that there?
00:05:19.277 - 00:05:26.909, Speaker A: Well, I don't think we should get too far into rumors. I think like the rumors circulated because of a bunch of layoffs they had 70% of their staff was laid off.
00:05:26.957 - 00:05:49.973, Speaker B: That's right. That's what it is. So yeah, they're not going bankrupt. That's not. Thank you. I shouldn't say that, but they did lay off a lot of staff. And I think going back to what you were saying about Tether being confirmed as the financer for this mining operation, I think that is at the crux of this because if they did finance it, I don't know what the structure was like, but it could be such that Tether actually owns the operation.
00:05:49.973 - 00:05:58.355, Speaker B: We just, you know what, you know, like. And that's actually one of the things that this email says. I'm going to share my screen really quickly here if that's okay.
00:05:58.525 - 00:06:09.591, Speaker A: So they do own the operations everywhere it's been described to me and this has even been posted by the Swan Twitter account is that they are a managed mining operation, AKA like a middleman. So.
00:06:09.743 - 00:06:10.055, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:10.095 - 00:06:17.655, Speaker A: Yes, they did own a lot of hardware in some capacities but it was unclear if they how much infrastructure they own things of that nature.
00:06:17.775 - 00:06:36.415, Speaker B: And so. And going back to that in this email which Swan uses as part of its suit to as part of, you know, to build their case, they're using this as evidence that there was a conspiracy here. This email from Rafael which is their former head of mining. Right?
00:06:36.575 - 00:06:37.223, Speaker A: Yes.
00:06:37.359 - 00:07:11.501, Speaker B: They say. I'm trying to find where it says exactly in the email. Use Tether as cover, legal cover from Tether right here on this line towards the bottom says confidentiality and ip. We would be exposed something in writing if we do this staged walkout legal cover from Tether. So I can't help but wonder if that has something, if Tether's stake in this has something to do with them feeling like they can pull this off. Right. Because again, this would be super brazen to do unless you felt like you had legal standing to perform this alleged takeover of the mining business.
00:07:11.573 - 00:07:39.759, Speaker A: So I mean I think that's 100%. What about. I think here they just saw an opportunity to go with Tether to leave and they decided try to pull it off. So yeah, this is crazy. We will drop a link in the show notes for anyone who wants to take a look at it. Why does this matter? Well, they're one of the largest bitcoin miners. If you look at Hashrate as a private miner and they kind of took a lot of people by surprise when they came out of the woodwork last year.
00:07:39.759 - 00:07:48.043, Speaker A: So we'll close out there. The rest of the show is awesome. So go check that out. Colin. Goodbye for a second time.

00:08:59.865 - 00:09:00.177, Speaker C: And.
00:09:00.201 - 00:09:02.525, Speaker B: That'S what you have here tonight, boys.
00:09:02.825 - 00:09:26.031, Speaker A: Welcome back. Okay, we played a little video there I found from online Mining Mafia. Forget the handle who posted that, but shout out to the Mining Mafia for making bitcoin mining stocks fun again. Everyone's feeling the green right now. If we're looking at the last 24 hours, most mining stocks are shooting up. People are feeling bullish about their bags. We're not going to talk about mining stocks today.
00:09:26.031 - 00:09:40.261, Speaker A: We're going to talk about some of the companies, however. But I did want to mention that before we start the show off, people are feeling a little excited and there's a little greed on the timeline. You guys purchasing? You guys bidding on stocks? No.
00:09:40.293 - 00:09:42.981, Speaker B: Okay, should be probably.
00:09:43.093 - 00:09:46.101, Speaker A: But yeah, wouldn't it be a bad idea?
00:09:46.293 - 00:09:56.877, Speaker B: The time to allocate was a few weeks ago, I feel like. But I don't know. M2 number go up, liquidity go up. Hopefully that means that October is around the corner.
00:09:57.061 - 00:10:28.309, Speaker A: That's true. Well, for those CoinDesk listeners out there, if you subscribe to the main Mining Pod feed, which you can also find on Spotify, Apple, et cetera, you will find our new bitcoin stock show. It's just like a subsection or another weekly episode of the Mining Pod that's not on CoinDesk. We talk about bitcoin mining stocks and bitcoin stocks. So go check that out. Colin's been doing a lot of awesome shows on there recently. They come Out Wednesday's live stream and then a Thursday morning typically publish it.
00:10:28.309 - 00:10:56.177, Speaker A: But we're going to get into bitcoin. Bitcoin mining news this week. We're going to start off with right and Bit farm is reaching settlement. Then go over to Bit deer testing their seal 02 chip for their ASIC miner. I then go over to the sec some regulatory stuff with green mining not getting its suit dismissed and then finish up with Hut 8 doing a GPU as a service thing. I have a lot of questions about this one. And finished up with a cry corner.
00:10:56.177 - 00:11:06.213, Speaker A: Collins always on point with the cry corner. So we have a pretty good one again this week with Bill Maher. But first as always, Matt, take us away to our difficulty update.
00:11:06.389 - 00:11:20.669, Speaker C: Yeah, the difficulty has been adjusted very recently at the time of recording and it's gone down about four and a half percent. It's a minor. Seeing some relief out there at the same time that price.
00:11:20.757 - 00:11:21.865, Speaker A: Minor relief.
00:11:22.645 - 00:11:24.757, Speaker C: Yeah. Some minor. Minor relief.
00:11:24.901 - 00:11:25.197, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:25.221 - 00:11:37.714, Speaker C: So it's great to see. I don't know if we could have a tracker on hash price we could pull up but I mean we're probably close to at this point. $50 per dollar per.
00:11:37.918 - 00:12:04.433, Speaker B: We are at 46.75 bucks. 75 cents per PETA hash per day. Juicy compared to the, you know, 35 range, 38 range. We've been trending in for the last, you know. Well we were, we were about, at about 40. But you know, the last month if you look at it, it's just this huge trough that just ramps back up.
00:12:04.433 - 00:12:06.857, Speaker B: So miners rejoice.
00:12:06.961 - 00:12:12.257, Speaker C: But also still pretty brutal tantalizing levels here at 46, 47.
00:12:12.361 - 00:12:19.537, Speaker B: Absolutely tantalizing in the cadence of our voice. We're just super excited about these march.
00:12:19.641 - 00:12:44.239, Speaker A: You guys are not excited at all. This is big news. Okay. Price going back up 65k this morning as of recording difficulty went down. We're probably going to have an upward testament next time but we shall see. But this is a nice little break after we had like an upward march after the summer. We had a downward most of the summer post happening with a lot of hash rate coming offline.
00:12:44.239 - 00:13:01.879, Speaker A: But there was still like so much pressure on hash price. And now with bitcoin price going up and ASICS coming offline, maybe we're past that turning point. Do you think we're like past the depths of this bear market for mining. It got pretty gross there for a second. I think the load was like $38 per ash per day.
00:13:02.007 - 00:13:15.343, Speaker B: I think it was a little bit lower than that, Sheesh. But I mean like that, that depends on what print you're looking at. If you're looking at like hourly print or daily print. Yeah. So for daily probably 38. I don't know if it's. If we're out of the woods yet.
00:13:15.343 - 00:13:57.793, Speaker B: I'm looking at the five year chart right now. And if we assume that the four year cycle is real and that we do live in a simulation, you can look at the last halving epoch. Right after the 2020 halving hash price hit an all time low of around 60, $70 per PETA/ per day. It was in that range for a while and then the bull market kicked off and then everything skyrocketed. So if you think that we're at that point in the cycle, then you might expect it to go up from here. I definitely think we've hit something of a floor though. So even if bitcoin's price doesn't move and transaction fees stay the same, it's hard for me to imagine that too much hash rate can come online while still being profitable.
00:13:57.793 - 00:14:04.497, Speaker B: Right. You're going to have this constant tug of war between the miners deploying new machines and the miners who are still working with outdated hardware.
00:14:04.561 - 00:14:20.757, Speaker A: So yeah, we should probably do outdated hardware mining pod talking about like SJS and stuff like that. There's some interesting trades people are concocting in telegram chats around that. But we shall not talk about that now unless. Matt, do you have a question? Oh, okay.
00:14:20.821 - 00:14:35.301, Speaker C: I have a question for you two who are studying the end of the know day to day. Is the fractal stuff over? Because I is that has that led to some of this difficulty? Drop this epoch right.
00:14:35.373 - 00:15:08.825, Speaker B: 100% did. So right now last I looked the fractal only hash rate was at about like 20 exahashes a second. The token price dropped to about $13 up from down from. I think it got up to like 30 or 40. But long story short, it definitely had an impact on bitcoin's hash rate. You know, at the peak it was about 36, 40 exahashes that were mining only fractal and that was directly diverted away from the bitcoin network. So for a quick recap from our listeners who don't know this fractal is a bitcoin sidechain.
00:15:08.825 - 00:15:38.185, Speaker B: About a third of the blocks that are produced are via merge mining where bitcoin miners can produce hash rate. For both fractal and bitcoin, two thirds of the blocks come from mining. That is only for the Fractal network. And when the token price went up and transaction fees went up on fractal, we saw a lot of miners diverting their hash rate from the bitcoin network to only mine on fractal. And it was profitable for a while. So I definitely think that did have an impact. I think that for right now though, some of that hash rate has been reshored onto the bitcoin network.
00:15:38.185 - 00:16:00.813, Speaker B: Interesting kind of game theory thing though here. Right. I actually think there's an argument to be made that this is. I mean, it won't end up being like this, I don't think, because I don't think fractal is going to end up getting enough market share. But this is actually. This is negative for bitcoin's security budget in a way. Right, because you're actually designing a network that can attract hash rate away from bitcoin, but it can only be so much.
00:16:00.813 - 00:16:12.381, Speaker B: Right, because when all the miners flooded onto fractal, then the difficulty raised for permission mining on fractal, and so then it became less profitable than it came down. But that's maybe for another time.
00:16:12.533 - 00:16:14.245, Speaker C: Yeah. Miners are mercenaries.
00:16:14.365 - 00:16:15.305, Speaker B: They are mercenaries.
00:16:15.645 - 00:16:49.665, Speaker C: I wanted to bring this up and thank you for the background there briefly, because when typically we're this tight on the margins for miners and has prices in a position where it's in the difficulty actually tends to follow price pretty closely. And over the last epoch, like last two weeks, we're up 12% on price, yet we had a downward difficulty adjustment and a significant one at about four and a half percent. So I kind of anticipated that some of that was at play. We talked about a little bit last week, but I was just curious over to you, Will. What's our, what's our next story?
00:16:50.005 - 00:17:06.005, Speaker A: Actually, we're announcing a new podcast, Fractal Pod. We're not going to do that. Okay, let's go over. We're not fractal shills. We just happen to talk about it a lot. It did make a lot of money for people. Way to go and talk about Riot and Bit Farms.
00:17:06.005 - 00:17:26.901, Speaker A: This has been the saga of the summer. Okay, so let's go back in time before we go into this headline. I'll give the headline really quickly. Right. And Bit Farms settled. All right, so going back in time, we saw that Bit Farms dismissed its CEO, kind of like move them out the door. And then he sued.
00:17:26.901 - 00:18:11.427, Speaker A: He tried to get some money back for his equity, and so then they canned him. And then they set off like this whole thing where Riot was like, hey, you Know, Bit Farms, really big, they have a lot of hash rate, they're global, they're diversified, they have a lot of efficiency. Why don't we pick them up? Riot has a ton of cash on its balance sheet relative to other miners and they were having some efficiency problems. So I think it kind of looked like perhaps a win win. You know, purchase Bit Farms, bring them in house, diversify out of Texas and sort of get the help from bitfarms team to like bring more efficiency to your current setup. That didn't exactly go as planned because Bit Farms management didn't want this to happen. They were, I guess, nonplussed at the idea of having new ownership.
00:18:11.427 - 00:18:55.467, Speaker A: And there was pressure from Riot with this poison pill clause. So back and forth over the summer, Riot goes high as almost 20% ownership in bit Farms. We did some great pieces on this on the Mining Pod newsletter that Colin dug into. Give him some moment here a second to color it. The latest news we have now is that Riot and Bit Farms have decided to settle, that Riot will not seek to do anything more until 2026, and that there has been further board shuffling at Bit Farms to make Riot happy. What does this look like for Riot and Bit Farms in the future? Well, Riot still has a sizable position. They are able to offload it into the market, so there is that.
00:18:55.467 - 00:19:10.011, Speaker A: But also why offload this position when you built it up over the last few months and mining stocks might go up and maybe there's a future where they are still able to acquire them. Colin, I'll throw it over to you for your take on this article though.
00:19:10.083 - 00:19:38.125, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is kind of a ceasefire, but I wouldn't say this is over, at least from what I can tell. This still leaves the door open for Riot to do things in the future. One of the biggest provisions is Riot got one of its board nominees that it was pushing for appointed to the Bit Farmers board. This has resulted in one of Bit Farms own directors, Andreas. I'm not going to try to pronounce his last name. I'm just going to butcher it.
00:19:38.125 - 00:20:39.817, Speaker B: But he stepped down as a result of this agreement and Riot has agreed to withdraw a June 24 requisition, which it made to basically call a shareholder meeting to kind of put pressure on bitfarm's board, call their governance into question and try to push a vote to have them shuffled. Riot has agreed to stay that requisition until the 2026 annual meeting. So that's one of the big provisions that signals to me that Riot kind Of still, they don't have the ball in their court necessarily, but they still have the ability in the future, if they want to, to put more pressure on Bit Farms to try to force this takeover and just to back up a little bit more. This dates back to Riot's first share purchase of Bit Farms in March. Then they made an offer letter to bit farms of 950 million to buy the business outright in April. Bit Farms, as Will said, was nonplussed by this. They completely rebuffed it, seemed kind of pissed off by it.
00:20:39.817 - 00:21:15.245, Speaker B: It was totally unsolicited. They had some back and forth. And then Riot aggressively started purchasing shares in May of this year and got to the point where they ended up getting 19.9% of all bit Farm shares. And then Bit Farms threatened to do a poison pill through a shareholder rights plan where they were going to dilute Riot by issuing shares to all existing shareholders except for Riot. And so this settlement has put to rest at least the first part of this saga, as Will was talking about. But I still think that there are some considerations going into the future where Riot might try to do something later.
00:21:15.245 - 00:22:08.351, Speaker B: Right. Another one of the important provisions, I think, per the agreement, is during the next shareholder meeting, Riot has agreed to vote positively on a board member increase to a bit farms from 5 to 6. This will create a little more insulation for Bit Farms. Right? Especially if they can get someone that's on their side on the board. So they're trying to kind of beef the board up to have more people in their corner should push come to shove later on this last part on the press release, the company has provided Riot with certain rights, subject to certain exceptions, to purchase shares of the company, provided riot holds 50% or more of the outstanding common shares of the company. I'm not really sure what that means or what that entails, but it kind of sounds like to me Riot is saying we still want to be able to purchase more shares in the future. But maybe, like bitfarms is also planning to adopt that shareholder rights plan to keep them from a controlling stake like above 20%.
00:22:08.351 - 00:22:56.247, Speaker B: Anyway, this is all a bunch of complicated bullshit corporate legal, financial maneuvering. I highly recommend y'all check out a pod that I did for the bitcoin mining stock show last week on this and also our coverage on Block Space Media. But as far as I can tell, this is a win for Bit Farms and a loss for Riot. You know, now Riot is holding, you know, $200 million worth of bit Farm stock, and if that stock goes up Then great, then they're going to be able. This is going to be a great trade for them. They'll be able to make money. But I keep coming back to if I were a Riot shareholder, I would be kind of at a loss for why Riot was spending all this money on this takeover attempt when they could have just been putting all that money into expansion at Corsicana.
00:22:56.247 - 00:23:14.363, Speaker B: You know, they've got a lot of prepayments that they're going to have to make and a lot of deposits on future what's Miner equipment and immersion infrastructure and all these other things, of course, accommodate that they're planning to deploy over the next few years. You know, I just don't really see what the benefit of this was.
00:23:14.479 - 00:23:18.095, Speaker A: Can you do an equity deal with another company's equity for Asics?
00:23:19.595 - 00:23:20.715, Speaker B: What do you mean?
00:23:20.875 - 00:23:26.575, Speaker A: We've seen companies do equity deals for Asics using their own equity. Like.
00:23:30.675 - 00:23:31.659, Speaker B: I guess they could.
00:23:31.707 - 00:23:31.891, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:31.923 - 00:23:40.899, Speaker B: I don't think what's Miner would really, you know, Microbt would probably be like what you're trying to buy our N66 immersion units with bitforms.
00:23:41.067 - 00:23:45.109, Speaker A: I don't know, be alone against it. That's funny enough.
00:23:45.237 - 00:24:05.905, Speaker B: One last thing here. Riot diluted the shit out of people over the last year. I mean, I think they raised like half a billion dollars in equity offerings over the course of 2024 so far. I want to make sure that I'm right about this.
00:24:06.245 - 00:24:11.151, Speaker A: I believe there's stock is also down 51% year to date.
00:24:11.223 - 00:24:11.527, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:11.591 - 00:24:18.935, Speaker A: As compared to rivals like Terwolf and Irene, which are in the grain. Marathon's down 30%, which often people compare.
00:24:18.975 - 00:24:52.395, Speaker B: But, you know, a lot of the miners who are not AI pivot pivoted currently have kind of struggled. But, yeah, Riot raised 516 million from at the market offerings over the first half of 2024. And some of that went into Corsicana, some of that probably went into this. To me, it's like, why are you deluding your shareholders to try to purchase another Miner? And it's not even going to work out anyway. That's all I'll say on it. Maybe it works out in the future. I don't think we've seen the end of this, though.
00:24:52.695 - 00:25:59.775, Speaker C: I definitely think maybe it was becoming clear as a bit of an expensive strategy. And to your point, the stock was down quite a bit and hash price is not in a great place. I do. It kind of felt to me, my initial reaction to this was that it kind of let both sides walk away without the appearance of a loss Because Riot can, like, what was their goal? What they kind of set out to achieve is what they said is, you know, they were trying to make an impact on the governance of Bit Farms, right? And they did get somebody appointed to their board. And they do have the door open potentially in the future to continue their strategy. And then on the Bit Farm side, they get to basically say, hey, our strategy to prevent the takeover is intact and is successful. So I think it lets both sides kind of walk away without the like it seems to me, at least.
00:25:59.775 - 00:26:16.935, Speaker C: And I think the market received that a little bit as well. Like, I think on the day that this came out, both stocks were up. But I mean, I don't know. It's nice to see that the feud has tempered. Although it was exciting from the perspective of coming on a new show.
00:26:18.915 - 00:26:35.985, Speaker B: A lot of fodder. I think that's a good perspective, Matt. This kind of gives and this whole thing has been spin city from both sides. They're both trying to spin the press releases in their favor. And I do think that this gives them both the opportunity to your point, to be like, see, look, it's fine, you know.
00:26:36.365 - 00:27:04.579, Speaker A: Hash price hit a rock bottom at record lows of 0.000.69 BTC per PET hash per day or around $39 per PETash per day. On the other side, over at Nice Hash, pay rates are skyrocketing, practically hitting pre halving levels once again. Right now Nice hash is averaging 0.0014 BTC per petash per day. That's about $80 per PETA hash per day. The delta and pay rates between Nice hash and leading FPPs pools is 110% in favor of nice hash.
00:27:04.579 - 00:27:23.587, Speaker A: Connecting to nicehash is just as easy as joining any other mining pool. Head over to nicehash.com and be ahead of your competition. Okay, let's go over to this other topic. Bit Deer. We've talked a lot about BitDir recently and for good reason. They're kind of crushing.
00:27:23.587 - 00:27:53.893, Speaker A: So BitDeer announced that they complete testing of its latest Seal 02 Bitcoin mining chip. The initial prototype tests indicate an exceptional power efficiency ratio of 13.5 Joules. Per Terahash. Okay, so what I just read was from the press release from Bit Deer. We've had them on the show. We're having them on the show soon on the stock show and we've done some analysis pieces from our friends over at Second gate on them which have been bullish.
00:27:53.893 - 00:28:38.855, Speaker A: Bit dear. And one of the reasons people are bullish on them is because they have gotten allocation of tsmc, they have the former co founder Bitmain Jianwu at the helm and they're trying to make their own entire ASIC stack. They have the CL01 I believe already completed and they're using it in house. They didn't up going to market with it because it didn't really meet spec, but they were able to use it for their own mining purposes and now they're going to continue developing and it looks like they've had some positive updates with their seal 02. This would be competitive against bit main efficiency that is already on the market. Of course that's already on the market, like already out there. This is just in the testing phase but they are coming up to speed.
00:28:38.855 - 00:29:00.779, Speaker A: They have the allocation of TSMC and most importantly they have the capital to be able to I think see this through. Now two things to note is they do have a ton of debt and this is, you know, slower than the rest of the market. So I want to bring up those things. But Colin, I want to throw it over to you. You've done a little bit of writing on them and edited some of these pieces.
00:29:00.947 - 00:29:43.793, Speaker B: The end of H1 2024. To your point about debt, they have 155 million. That's not quite a core size level, but that's still pretty hefty. To your point. I think the interesting thing here going back to producing this and actually deploying it at scale is something that Brandon Bailey of Second Gate Advisory pointed out in an op ed for us also in a report that he did for Bit Deer and that is that this gives them the optionality to produce hash rate for a discount to spot versus if they were going to Bitmain or Microbt. And I'd like to share my screen really quickly here to show exactly what I'm talking about. So Brandon has this really good report.
00:29:43.793 - 00:30:39.463, Speaker B: I highly recommend y'all go check it out. You can find it on his Twitter page. You can also read his op ed at Blockspace Media. But basically the cost of production for the Seal 1 and the Seal 2 right here gives them the opportunity to again produce this and deploy it at a less at a lower cost of capital than they would otherwise if they were going with one of the other big manufacturers. So Brandon put this sensitivity table together and he basically shows at different costs per terahash how much, you know for this table how much 48.2 exahashes of total hash rate would cost in terms of their capex to deploy this and if it's as low as $11 per terahash, you're looking at a 39% discount compared to an S21 Pro from Bitmain. And even on the higher end of this, it's $14 per terahash.
00:30:39.463 - 00:31:22.211, Speaker B: For one of these seal miners, you're looking at a 22% discount compared to an S19 or S21 Pro. So if these chips and these Asics end up being competitive in terms of efficiency and hash rate like BITD is saying they are, and they can deploy them, you're going to see two things. You're going to see the bit deers cost to expand just outperform. I mean, excuse me, you're going to see bit deers cost to expand be well below the industry average. Republic miners, you're also going to see their efficiency just really, really come back into a competitive range. Right now, Bit deers entire fleet efficiency as of H1 20, 24 at the end of Q2 is 31.6 joules per terahash.
00:31:22.211 - 00:31:44.110, Speaker B: That is pretty uncompetitive compared to the industry average right now. I mean most miners are at 24, 25 or below. Part of the reason is because they're banking on using these machines that they're producing in house. They don't want to go out and buy a bunch of Bitmain or Microbt. They're going to be able to do this themselves. So that's what I would expect over the next few years. Bitir's got like 1.1
00:31:44.110 - 00:32:07.851, Speaker B: gigawatts worth of of megawatt under development currently or, sorry, 1.1 gigawatts of capacity under development currently. They should be able to outfit that below industry average costs and they should also improve their efficiency over the next year if all of this works out. I'm going to be looking out for both of those things in future production updates. But curious if you have any other thoughts here as well, Matt.
00:32:08.003 - 00:32:09.335, Speaker C: Big if true.
00:32:09.755 - 00:32:11.375, Speaker B: Big if true.
00:32:11.755 - 00:32:16.185, Speaker C: Those are some pretty staggering discount numbers.
00:32:16.725 - 00:32:18.045, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll say that off the bat.
00:32:18.085 - 00:32:27.585, Speaker C: And I mean over 1 GW in development is massive. That's ridiculous. It's quite even sound real.
00:32:28.045 - 00:32:28.869, Speaker A: Yeah. Right.
00:32:28.957 - 00:32:36.061, Speaker B: I always like to take those with a little bit of a grain of salt because is that immediately energized or is that down the road? Right.
00:32:36.173 - 00:33:12.041, Speaker A: Yeah. That's the interesting thing with those pipeline conversations. A lot of miners talk about they have huge megawatts in the pipeline, but what does that mean to be in the pipeline? Like are those deals signed? Are those conversations you're having. That's hard to know. One other thing with Bit Deer that probably isn't worth mentioning, but I think it's kind of interesting to me and maybe to Colin and Matt is Bit Deer is currently selling off a lot of S19 models in a Norway site. It's unclear to me why they're selling, but they're doing like an open auction and you can go bid on these units. They're selling for as low as 1.$5
00:33:12.041 - 00:33:42.491, Speaker A: per terahash. So I think that's sort of setting like almost a bottom for the market right now what those units are worth. And if you think about it, that's crazy. 1.5 dollars per terahash compared to last cycle where some of these S and T models were going for $10,000 per unit, $100 around $100 per terahash. So we've seen our own sort of shitcoin charts within bitcoin mining. Right.
00:33:42.491 - 00:33:43.916, Speaker A: Where things are down 99%.
00:33:44.010 - 00:33:50.528, Speaker B: 99% drawdown. I just remember some going for 120 in November of 2021. Yep.
00:33:50.623 - 00:33:56.891, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember a few quotes for $25,000 ASIC prices during that cycle.
00:33:57.083 - 00:34:08.109, Speaker C: I wanted to add another probably useless bit. Dear friend, I'm pretty sure that they are the ones who partnered with the Kingdom of Bhutan.
00:34:08.237 - 00:34:08.661, Speaker A: Yes.
00:34:08.733 - 00:34:19.653, Speaker C: Which if you don't know about the Kingdom of Bhutan, very exciting story. And you should check out our show last week because I can't get enough Bhutan.
00:34:19.749 - 00:34:32.985, Speaker A: I really wanted to do a mining documentary with them, kind of like we did with Galaxy. But apparently you have to get permission from the Kingdom and it's like a whole ordeal. I've heard rumors that there is one in the works. However.
00:34:35.134 - 00:35:16.445, Speaker B: In the competitive world of bitcoin mining, one name stands out. CleanSpark, America's Bitcoin miner. At CleanSpark, efficiency isn't just a goal, it's our standard. Our sophisticated facilities are built and led by expert teams who care about bitcoin and the communities we work in scale we've mastered. Our large scale operations have set us apart in the industry. As examples of community oriented building, Our track record speaks for itself. We navigate the complexities of the new economy with precision and with skill, continuously achieving operational milestones.
00:35:16.445 - 00:35:24.435, Speaker B: Curious about how we do it? We invite you to discover the story behind CleanSpark success.
00:35:24.657 - 00:35:38.715, Speaker A: Cleanspark.com okay, let us go to other untrodden areas of bitcoin mining news, green mining and the sec. Colin, he doesn't want to do it. You picked the Topic.
00:35:38.835 - 00:36:06.171, Speaker B: I do want to do it. I think we need to. I did pick this topic, but the reason I picked it is because we need to get the record straight and people need to stop sharing watcher Guru articles and headlines. If you are a journalist and you are sourcing from Watcher guru, shame on you. Shame on your editorial room. But. So this headline kind of rippled through the bitcoin mining news cycle and within bitcoin miners.
00:36:06.171 - 00:36:30.269, Speaker B: And the original headline was SEC rules Crypto Mining devices or securities. What they're really saying is they are pushing back against an order from this company called Green Limited. I think it is. What is it here? Green United llc. And this company is under screening by the sec. They're getting sued. They tried to push to have this case dismissed.
00:36:30.269 - 00:37:20.121, Speaker B: A judge denied that. And the SEC complaint, which was filed a long time ago, actually, it looks like this is dated March of 2023, which is kind of funny. This is coming out of the crypto. Basically, the SEC is suing this company because they issued and sold these green mining boxes to investors, promising them a return on these boxes through their green token. Now, these were ostensibly mining machines that were mining a proof of work network that doesn't actually exist. And this is the important part from the complaint in Section 3, or Point 3, at the beginning of the complaint, the SEC says, in reality, the green boxes and green nodes purchased by the investors did not mine green. This is because green and ERC20 token was not mineable crypto asset.
00:37:20.121 - 00:38:10.791, Speaker B: And the green blockchain promoted by the defendant did not exist. So this company sold these mining devices and then issued an ERC20 token to the people buying them, acting like they were mining rewards. So obviously this falls under the realm of what the SEC would consider a security. There's a bunch of stuff at the bottom where they say that, you know, the Green Limited Company was promising returns, that the company's executives use the money to enrich themselves, yada, yada, yada. We've seen this story before, but I kind of wanted to just put this out there because, you know, essentially this caught the world, the mining world by storm. And people were freaking out about it temporarily, but it was really just a nothing burger because this is just a shitcoin, right? This has nothing to do with bitcoin mines, bitcoin mining, or any other legitimate proof of work network.
00:38:10.983 - 00:38:23.955, Speaker C: This is a very silly story. I'm ready to move to the next story. They broke their contractual obligations very outright. I don't have much to comment here.
00:38:24.735 - 00:38:26.159, Speaker B: I don't Know what happened?
00:38:26.287 - 00:38:42.877, Speaker A: It did get really bad on Twitter yesterday, though. There was a bunch of people being like, mining is a security or bitcoin miners are security. It's like, really, we're doing this again? But sun comes up, new fud, new male Twitter account with bad information.
00:38:43.021 - 00:38:59.743, Speaker C: It becomes relevant if there is some language in there that sets precedent for future such cases. Right. Or if they use it as guidance to draft a bill or a law amendment. My very naive opinion is that I feel like that's doubtful.
00:38:59.869 - 00:39:32.217, Speaker A: Well, no worries. We'll move away from that and go to Hut 8. Hut 8 GPU as a service vertical goes live with inaugural deployment. 1000 Nvidia H100 GPU is delivered and AI cloud development. So, Matt, I'm going to throw this one over to you. The gist of it though is hut 8 is getting into GPU as a service with a hosting contract where they are hosting with a third party and then further sending this hosted hash rate or this hosted GPU time to other clients.
00:39:32.401 - 00:39:47.065, Speaker C: Yep. AI. If you haven't had enough bitcoin mining AI crossover, this story is for you. Yeah, HUD 8 looks like a sort of cloud AI type setup.
00:39:47.185 - 00:39:47.441, Speaker B: Right?
00:39:47.473 - 00:40:00.995, Speaker C: It's the cloud mining space, but applied to GPUs and AI, we'll see what comes of it. Colin, you might. Honestly, you likely know a lot more about this than I do, so what do you think?
00:40:01.155 - 00:40:41.875, Speaker B: I don't really know enough about it, honestly. All I know is that Hut 8 was one of the first miners to set up an HPC business line back in 2022. They purchased five data centers from Terago. The margins on that are pretty thin. Seems like this is their attempt to break further into the HPC and AI landscape by offering different services. I'm really curious to know or to learn more about exactly how these contracts will work. I'm not positive what the benefit of this is for HUD 8 long term, other than trying to drum up hype around AI and hpc like we've seen with a lot of miners.
00:40:41.875 - 00:41:29.825, Speaker B: This kind of lease model is very, very popular with public bitcoin miners because it is an easy way for them to break in to make an announcement that they are, you know, moving forward with an AI strategy. The market typically rewards them. I just would love to know who's on the other end of this, who's buying these GPUs as a service? What kind of contract pipeline does Hut 8 actually have to leverage these? How monetizable is this in the future? So those would be my questions that I would have for the Hut 8 team. We're hopefully going to have them on the mining pod or on the stock show here very, very soon. So I'll definitely be following up with them regarding this. Although I would say that Hut 8 is up 18% over the past five days. So.
00:41:29.945 - 00:41:30.529, Speaker C: Wow.
00:41:30.657 - 00:41:32.929, Speaker A: Maybe the people love it.
00:41:33.097 - 00:42:00.839, Speaker B: The people do love it. The people love AI. I mean it's like, it's like I said in one of my newsletters a while back, it's like the word brat or some of these Gen Z terms. No one knows what it means, but gets the people going. And that's really the thing about AI is it's there's so much hype around it that I think that it's a great line. Yeah, they could do any press release, honestly, as long as it wasn't fraudulent. And they would end up getting a little bit of a stock bump because of it.
00:42:00.887 - 00:42:47.717, Speaker A: Right, so Interested in Bitcoin Scaling startups?

00:42:47.717 - 00:42:52.573, Speaker A: Speaking of people not knowing about things and talking about it, let's go to our cry corner.
00:42:52.669 - 00:43:15.737, Speaker B: There's the other big secret about crypto that nobody talks about. This bugs me so much. We just had Bjorn talking about the environment. All the progress that we're making with green energy is being sucked away by crypto. Crypto uses 8% of total electricity, their data centers. They're mining this nonsense of finding a number. I can't even go through the whole thing.
00:43:15.737 - 00:43:23.393, Speaker B: It's so ridiculous what crypto really is. That's why it's of course this is. This is like Trump's final business just before the election.
00:43:23.449 - 00:43:26.287, Speaker A: Of course he'd end up in crypto. It's a grifter's power paradise.
00:43:26.351 - 00:43:45.743, Speaker B: It's a. It's comparable to putting 15.7 million additional gas powered cars on the road. So as we take them off to go to electric crypto eats it all up and goes the other way. I love it. Feel my blood pressure raising. You go man, I've talked a lot.
00:43:45.743 - 00:43:46.835, Speaker B: You go.
00:43:49.215 - 00:43:56.165, Speaker C: He goes, I can't even say anything more about this. It's so ridiculous code for I don't know anything about this.
00:43:56.205 - 00:43:57.745, Speaker A: So I can't talk about this.
00:44:00.645 - 00:44:05.229, Speaker C: 8% of total electricity. What a preposterous stat.
00:44:05.317 - 00:44:10.665, Speaker A: I'm honestly really bullish Mining. That was Bill Maher on. What is this show called? Bill Maher Show Tonight.
00:44:11.125 - 00:44:13.269, Speaker B: It's just like Apple tv, right?
00:44:13.397 - 00:44:21.905, Speaker A: It's like on Max and Apple tv. But yeah, I mean he had talked about crypto that went viral on Twitter. Every big bitcoin.
00:44:24.805 - 00:44:33.981, Speaker B: Anytime anyone says anything bad about bitcoin, you just look at the replies and it's just everyone on bitcoin Twitter pouring in. We must look like such a cult.
00:44:34.133 - 00:45:56.439, Speaker C: Yeah, I will say you go back to when there was the boiling the oceans comment which is now a part of the lore. Back then there wasn't kind of the academic papers and kind of the like the lobbying organizations and kind of more prominent mainstream bitcoin supporters. So I guess at least the positive is now in the comments instead of just people saying, you know, you stink, you know, you're the worst. There is stuff to cite and there are people I think that seem at least to have built up credibility and come out and speak about the environmental benefits and just the fact that it's simply not true and the digiconomist papers are just absolutely wrong, blatantly wrong, and have been disproven over and over again. And I mean really, it's like someone, someone in the production room, like with Bill Maher should just pull him aside and say hey, you know, we should walk these things back because it's just simply wrong.
00:45:56.607 - 00:46:32.931, Speaker B: So did the is the 8% from Alex de Vries, the economist behind Digi Economists. Because even for him the 8% seems ludicrous. I mean that is. I would love a citation. And to go back to your point, Matt, we have Cambridge, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, tracking bitcoin's electricity consumption, at least providing an estimate it's impossible to completely track. Let's just get that out of the way. But they provide what should be considered the definitive estimate because their methodology is some of the best that we have.
00:46:32.931 - 00:47:05.569, Speaker B: They've also, I believe, integrated coinmetrics nonce analysis that we can kind of get an idea for the average joule per terahash rating of the network. And if we look at Cambridge's estimates, it's the mid estimate is 16.76 gigawatts, which equates to 146.88 terawatt hours per year. That that equals out to 0.5% of the world's electricity. Now to some people that probably is cold comfort because that still seems like a lot, but it is a far cry away from 8% and it's absolutely ridiculous.
00:47:05.569 - 00:47:44.399, Speaker B: The only reason he's using this is because it scores political points for him and it's an easy story. That's the other thing that just blows my mind about this is the idea that this is somehow no one's talking about it, Bill. This has been the only thing that the media has reported on for like five or six, seven years. This is not a news story. And to your point, Matt, there's so much good data out there, you'd think that the media class, and I know Bill is kind of like an estranged child of that now he's broken away a little bit from the mainstream mold. But you're supposed to trust the experts. Well, look at Cambridge again, one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
00:47:44.399 - 00:48:14.323, Speaker B: They have data on this. It pisses me off that we're still talking about it. And sorry, I'll end my tirade with this. The tie in with Trump at the end is just, can we get over it guys? The only reason he is cozying up to bitcoiners in the first place is because the Democrats have been a train wreck with regards to public relations with them. You can look at the choke point 2.0 stuff that Nick Carter has reported about in Pirate wires. All you need to do is read about how Silvergate was basically sabotaged by the Biden administration.
00:48:14.323 - 00:48:35.641, Speaker B: You just need to look at what Elizabeth Warren has said about crypto and bitcoin use around the world, funding Hamas using phony numbers. It's an easy political win for him. It's just like there's so much about this clip that is just so beyond the pale to me that I'm just amazed that we're still having these conversations in 2024.
00:48:35.753 - 00:49:02.335, Speaker A: Sorry, this is becoming the end of week stress relief for calling a block space where the pent up aggression of working in bitcoin mining media, it just needs to get it out. I'm not surprised. This is mainstream media. They take a poorly constructed data set, try to turn into a joke, ship it, make a lot of money. So not surprising to me to your.
00:49:02.375 - 00:49:11.751, Speaker C: Point before will, if it's 8% of total electricity, man, would it be difficult to rewrite that chain? I'm feeling pretty good about. Yeah.
