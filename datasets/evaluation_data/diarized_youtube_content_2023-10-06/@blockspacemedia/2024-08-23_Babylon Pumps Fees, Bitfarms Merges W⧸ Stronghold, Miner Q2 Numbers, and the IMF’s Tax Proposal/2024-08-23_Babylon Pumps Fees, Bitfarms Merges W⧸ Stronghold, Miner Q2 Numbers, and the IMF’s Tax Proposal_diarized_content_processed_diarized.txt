The Miner Mag brings you free data and analysis from all major NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining operations. To know who stands out, check out Visualize metrics and data dependent stories@theminermag.com okay, let's jump right into it. We're going to have our difficulty update which we do every week with our MEM pool forecaster Matt. It's kind of becoming like a weekly segment. It's difficulty adjustment.
00:01:09.227 - 00:01:10.267, Speaker B: He's like a weatherman.
00:01:10.371 - 00:01:18.251, Speaker A: He is a weatherman. At some point we have larger budget. We'll get him like a whole screen. Yeah, that'd be kind of cool.
00:01:18.323 - 00:01:22.815, Speaker B: That'd be kind of cool. As you can see we have a high fee front moving in here to the right.
00:01:23.755 - 00:01:53.117, Speaker A: One of my favorite Twitter posters. Gosh, I'm blanking on his name. Had did that way back in 2019. Okay, we will go from there over to our club corner with Tyler from Compass. He's going to come on to talk to us for a brief moment about ASIC prices from what they're seeing in their marketplace. Then we're going to go through some bitcoin mining news this week starting off with the Babylon fee pump. If you try to send a bitcoin transaction end of this week you probably notice it was really expensive.
00:01:53.117 - 00:02:26.757, Speaker A: We'll talk about why they want to go through Collins Q2 financial report. Colin did an amazing job for the Mining Pod newsletter which you should definitely go subscribe to if you click in the show notes and we'll go through all seven different charts that you should know about for public bitcoin miners. Then we'll go over to Bit Farms land. They're dealing with riot. They got stronghold going on. They got a lot, a lot of news on that front. So we'll sit there for probably a bit and then we'll finish up with a hair pulling story about The IMF trying to attack our favorite bitcoin miners.
00:02:26.757 - 00:02:36.717, Speaker A: So that's the news roundup for the day, gents. Let's get going. I'm going to move us over to the mempool. Matt, you ready to dive in with us?
00:02:36.861 - 00:02:43.905, Speaker C: Yeah. I'll forecast the mempool and then afterwards we'll do traffic and sports.
00:02:44.645 - 00:02:48.297, Speaker A: Traffic and sports with Matt afterwards. Okay, take us away.
00:02:48.461 - 00:03:15.227, Speaker C: Yeah. Sort of about halfway through the difficulty adjustment period. I think there's about 900 blocks to go. The previous difficulty adjustment was a downward one about 4%. And it looks like we're going to go up about two and a half percent. So reclaim a little bit of that. And I think the story broadly here is like Price in the last week is up about three and a half percent.
00:03:15.227 - 00:03:38.739, Speaker C: Right. And I think in this environment everyone's kind of tight at the margins and so difficulties actually following price pretty closely. But yeah, I mean, there's not much to talk about here. Like the. In the broad scope of things, miners are still in a pretty tough place. Despite price increasing quite a bit, the having effects are continuing on. Right.
00:03:38.739 - 00:03:54.225, Speaker C: We're at about between 40 and $50 per PETA hash on the hash price. And so, you know, everyone is kind of cost conscious and trying to squeeze out everything they can from their margins.
00:03:54.645 - 00:03:55.637, Speaker A: That's it.
00:03:55.821 - 00:03:57.069, Speaker C: Now to you for sports.
00:03:57.197 - 00:04:03.941, Speaker A: Will sports just getting ready for the Denver Nuggets season. Training camp will be starting soon here.
00:04:04.053 - 00:04:08.037, Speaker B: I'm excited about. No one cares about the Nuggets. It's football season, baby.
00:04:08.101 - 00:04:18.145, Speaker A: Hey, there's a decent amount of mining pod listeners. There's a lot of mining pod listeners in Colorado, so a few of them are Nuggets fans.
00:04:18.645 - 00:04:21.717, Speaker B: Well, Matt and I are southern boys. We care about college football.
00:04:21.821 - 00:04:39.711, Speaker C: I do care about college football. But I will actually bring this back to mining and say the latest excitement in the ecosystem is what's going on with transaction fees, which are very apparent on the mempool space screen we were just showing. So Will, what's going on with the fee environment?
00:04:39.823 - 00:04:51.115, Speaker A: Well, before we go to Feland and talk about Babylon, excellent segue. But we got to bring up Tyler from Compass to talk about ASIC prices. Tyler, welcome to the show.
00:04:51.495 - 00:05:04.787, Speaker D: Hey guys. Yeah, thanks for. Thanks for bringing me on. What I wanted to kind of share, which is super interesting. I mean, all of us think that bitcoin price is going up soon, you know, tomorrow, next month. Who knows when. Maybe we're naive, I don't know.
00:05:04.787 - 00:05:57.221, Speaker D: But it seems like all the people that are using The Compass marketplace believe the same thing. There, there's a lot of people going in and buying S19J pros, which right now are not very profitable. You know, you, you buy, they're buying them at a loss, anticipating that price is going to go up quicker than difficulty and they might be very valuable in the future. I don't know if they want to offload the hardware when the hardware appreciates or if they're just trying to buy them when they're cheap so that they can acquire a lot of, a lot of bitcoin when they are profitable. And I don't know, I think this is, this is telling that people are doing so the whole game when it comes to mining is kind of unfortunately like chasing efficiency. You have to make sure that your fleet is efficient as these new models come out. And it's a very, very difficult game to play.
00:05:57.221 - 00:06:46.831, Speaker D: Matt, I want to actually dive into you, into this with you later because you seem to have a good pulse on these publicly traded miners who are kind of following a similar strategy. I did not anticipate that the S, the S21s would be as efficient as they are considering how efficient the S19J pros are. I thought they would kind of taper off over time, but out of nowhere they came out massive efficiency jump. And even so, people are still just buying these old models instead of buying the new models to improve their fleet efficiency. So I have some examples. We can kind of go through how, how people need to, how miners need to think about chasing this efficiency to make sure that they're competitive year over year over year. But yeah, Matt, what are you seeing with like publicly traded companies? Because I know big players are doing, doing a similar strategy.
00:06:46.943 - 00:07:01.199, Speaker C: Well, I mean, I don't know how much I honestly will comment on the public listed miners, but I would just say generally when you're looking at these machines, maybe the case for buying one of these older rigs is just the time to break even.
00:07:01.247 - 00:07:01.431, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:01.463 - 00:07:41.831, Speaker C: It's kind of like an old minor metric that isn't necessarily talked about as much anymore. But if the upfront cost of some of these newer machines is quite high and your margins are, you know, pretty thin still relatively, then it might take a long time to actually pay them off. So they're taking into account, I think a lot of factors when they're actually buying rigs. Right. Depreciation is a major kind of expense if you look at it that way for miners. Colin, what do you think about the publicly listed miners and kind of this approach? And I Guess just generally picking your hardware.
00:07:41.983 - 00:07:55.423, Speaker B: Yeah, well so I maybe a counter take here from a lot of the analysis that I've done. I mean the leading public miners have just been piling into next gen machines for good reason.
00:07:55.479 - 00:07:55.719, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:55.767 - 00:08:44.421, Speaker B: I mean we saw riot for instance by just insane numbers of what's miner M50 and M60 series. At the end of last year the S21 was quite popular with a lot of bitcoin miners as well. You know you had bit farms and clean spark and a few others order those. So I'm curious about who is buying these S19J pros because to your point Matt, there is a consideration for payback time if you have cheap enough power and this has been very popular often with off grid miners on oil and gas sites. As long as they have enough uptime they'll run these older generation machines all day long. Because the capex is laughable compared to how quickly they can ROI them. Right.
00:08:44.421 - 00:09:27.431, Speaker B: But then there's another part of me that thinks, Tyler, to your point is this like the S9 trade last cycle where it's like, you know, we didn't quite get to the point where people were giving away S19J pros. Maybe we will, you know let's not, let's not speak for the future just yet but last cycle S9s were basically. You couldn't get someone to take them off your hands, people were giving them away and then suddenly, you know, a few months later when hash price was ripping in 2021, those things were selling for a couple grand. Right. So I wonder if people are having the same mentality with S19J Pro. Are they going to try to flip these in a few months? Are they hoping that they can? It's an interesting trade. We'll see if it pays off.
00:09:27.543 - 00:10:00.671, Speaker D: Yeah, I will say that, you know, we have this kind of retirement program. I don't know why my TV's seizing in the back background but we have this retirement program where people can take old gen machines and they can kind of cash them in. Kind of like a phone phone trade up. You have a, I don't know what number out there on. You have an iPhone 15, you know bring it in. We'll give you a couple hundred dollars to trade up to the iPhone 16. So we have something like that and there are a lot of players that are either scooping up those old units or they're, they're taking their existing fleet and they're trading those out for the new gen.
00:10:00.671 - 00:10:22.879, Speaker D: So it's just like an interesting strategy to See how people are approaching the next generation and prepping for whatever is about to come. I know the big players, you know, they have a much bigger bill every single month, so they're probably swapping out as much as their fleet for new gen as they possibly can. But it's just like, interesting to see what people are doing from. From, you know, smaller levels.
00:10:23.007 - 00:11:12.011, Speaker A: Yeah. On that smaller level front, do you have a question for you, Tyler? So since you guys operate this marketplace, how often do you guys talk to customers or do you get information from clients about people like turning over units and where things are expressing from a hosting perspective? We've had a few hosting shows here and there. Hosting business is pretty straightforward, so there's not a lot to digest there. But given that you guys are operating in this place, I'm curious, how much do you guys kind of help people choose to like flip through different units and like move on to new ones? To me, I'd be like a little worried or anxious about that given that difficulty is always going up so, so hard and fast and then like cost to put units in a new facility can be, you know, be hard to find a new place.
00:11:12.163 - 00:11:51.505, Speaker D: Yeah. So I mean, something that I've been doing this year is actually trying to get more customer interviews for product standpoint, which is really funny. Now I'm. Now I'm actually talking to customers saying, you know, what is your intent? Are you trying to grow your fleet, trying to chase efficiency? I think your question was just what am I hearing? And it's exactly what we're seeing. Right. Some people are trying to double down on these cheaper units waiting for price appreciation. They got a little bit of a savings account or they're not worried about the yield mining at a loss for a minute, while others are just doing anything they possibly can to get their efficiency down and yeah, just like prep for any scenario.
00:11:51.625 - 00:12:09.409, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like an interesting perspective on how risk adverse the hosting crowd is for bitcoin mining, which a smaller percentage of network, but interesting percentage. Okay, we'll finish up there. Tyler, any last words before we move on to talk about Babylon Chain and fee pumps?
00:12:09.497 - 00:12:11.225, Speaker D: Nope, I'm all set. Thanks so much.
00:12:11.305 - 00:12:42.999, Speaker A: Well, we'll see you here soon. Peace. Okay, let's go over to Babylon land and watch this quick clip from a recent interview on bitcoin season two. Charlie, who's often on this show, is talking with David. Say he is the co founder and creator of Babylon Chain. And why is this important? Well, this morning fees pumped really, really hard. We saw a bitcoin block with 15 bitcoin reward in it, and then a bunch of bitcoin blocks with like 9, 6, 5 bitcoin rewards in there.
00:12:42.999 - 00:12:51.243, Speaker A: So it cost some people by surprise. And we can discuss all the reasons that this is of course important, but let's listen to this clip really quick.
00:12:51.379 - 00:13:27.207, Speaker D: Because they provide us security. So phase one is to bootstrap the system by recruiting a bunch of bitcoin stake. Okay, so now in phase one, bitcoin holders can stake bitcoin onto the protocol. And after we accumulate a sufficient level of stakeholders, then in phase two, we will now launch a few chains, starting with the Babylon chain. And those chains will receive bitcoin security from the stake that we accumulated from phase one. So that's how we bootstrap the system. We start with the supply and then we bring in the demand.
00:13:27.311 - 00:14:04.795, Speaker A: Cool. So what you just heard there was David say describing how Babylon chain works. It's basically a network that allows proof of state networks to tie their security to the bitcoin chain. And what does this mean practically for miners? Well, you don't really have to care about Babylon at all, but you should be aware of these meta protocols that are exogenous to bitcoin because they're going to impact your revenue for bitcoin mining. Like I said a minute ago, we saw fees pump to a crazy amount this morning. One block had almost $1 million in total rewards, coinbase and fees. So, Matt, I'll toss it over to you.
00:14:04.795 - 00:14:07.935, Speaker A: Any thoughts on that at all?
00:14:08.055 - 00:14:36.621, Speaker C: Yeah, for me, I'm at least, at least initially skeptical of kind of these L2. So the. I can't speak as much about the meta protocol itself, Babylon, but where these things actually impact the fee environment on bitcoin I'm very interested in. And so I'm interested in honestly, like out the gate, who actually won this 15 and nine Bitcoin blocks. I mean we're talking about five times the normal block reward here.
00:14:36.733 - 00:14:50.785, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like it was Ant Pool won the 9 bitcoin, then Ample won the 15. Bitcoin Foundry won the 12. Bitcoin Ampool won an 8 bitcoin via 1 and 8 Bitcoin Foundry won a 7.
00:14:52.885 - 00:14:56.265, Speaker B: Trends towards centralization is because like this.
00:14:57.605 - 00:15:05.225, Speaker A: I was wondering if we'd get to this topic. There was a lot of tweets about FPPs, especially from Bitcoin Mechanic this morning on Twitter.
00:15:05.645 - 00:15:07.613, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
00:15:07.629 - 00:15:27.265, Speaker B: That's kind of a tangent, maybe. We've talked about it a lot just for another episode But I like what they're doing at Ocean. But to fix FPPs, you need to fix FPPs like, like full stop. You can't just create a new pool and expect all the hash rate to go over there. Shout out though. Love you, Bitcoin mechanic. Don't like the spam filters, but I like Ocean Pool.
00:15:28.645 - 00:15:55.515, Speaker A: Cool. I guess there's not much to it besides that because I don't really have a desire to go into Babylon Protocol and all what they're doing. If you do though, go check out Bitcoin Season 2. We dropped an exclusive interview with David say, the founder of that which we recorded live in Bitcoin Nashville. Let's go to this more pertinent news for Bitcoin land, which is Bit Farms expanding its size.
00:15:55.675 - 00:16:33.513, Speaker C: Yeah. So a couple different interesting news bits that I guess are Bit Farms related happen this week. So first is they scooped up Stronghold Digital. This is actually the result of three years of ongoing discussion. So this isn't something that seems to just impulsively be happen. It was the deal was valued at 125 million in equity with an additional 50 million in assumed debt. The kind of other thing that's going on at the same time is the kind of hostile takeover that Riot is trying to put onto Bit Farms.
00:16:33.513 - 00:16:47.365, Speaker C: And so they've reached a level that is nearing what's called the quote unquote poison pill level. They're at 19.9%. Will you want to explain the poison pill level?
00:16:48.065 - 00:17:11.845, Speaker A: The poison pill, yeah, I'll explain that. And I'm going to throw the first topic back to Colin afterwards. So Colin, just you be ready. I'll be coming for you. So for this Riot thing, right, We've been tracking it all summer. It was first kind of announced, I'd say like, yeah, June ish. If memory serves me right, Bit Farms had a lot of leadership transitions, some shakeups.
00:17:11.845 - 00:17:33.261, Speaker A: Their former CEO was like kind of kicked out, but then sued over being kicked out. It looked like it was just kind of resignation. Turned out it was more than that. Then they had a leadership shuffle. Ben Gagnon, who was the CMO chief mining officer, not marketing officer, this is bitcoin mining. He took over as CEO. He is like a true bitcoiners bitcoiner.
00:17:33.261 - 00:18:35.677, Speaker A: And so a lot of people in the bitcoin community were very excited for that. As opposed to some of the older faces at Bit Farms which were seen as more tradfi. Confessedly, I don't know the history of the former executives, so that might not be a fair Characterization, but that's definitely what I've seen on Twitter. So for this Poison pill, essentially, Riot has been steadily picking up more of the outstanding share pool of Bit Farms with the intent and purpose of totally acquiring Bit Farms. And they can't quite do that because there is this poison pill which I'll describe in a second at 20%. In the meantime, what they are able to do is exert pressure on the board of directors and start installing people who are more pro Riot or maybe pro leadership changes within Bit Farms that help Riot out. So it's unclear what that exactly means, but we do know that there has been some leadership shakeups and one of the key executives that Riot actually wanted ousted did step down the other week and that was one of the long term, long term co founders.
00:18:35.677 - 00:19:23.055, Speaker A: So having that stake in the company does really matter. There's a bunch of things around us we're talking before the show that have to do with how these things work as c corporations or even just like public companies. And I don't know the intricacies of those things lawyers who make a lot of money do. For this Poison pill, we can scroll down to the article from the Miner Mag. Bitfarms adopted a second shareholder rights plan known as a Poison pill Strategy, granting shareholders one right per share, exercisable if any entity acquires 20% or more bit Farm shares without a permitted bid. So initially this poison pool is actually sent at 15% and then the Ontario Capital Markets Tribunal sided with Riot and moved it to 20%. Uh, what does this really mean? Started with.
00:19:23.055 - 00:20:03.335, Speaker A: Started with Riot and moved it from 15% to 20%. So initially the poison pill was at 15%, that bit farm set. And then they. Riot got upset, talked to Ontario tribunal and they had it moved at 20%. What does this really mean? Like it just protects Bit Farms in case they want to stop this takeover, this hostile takeover. There's different ways that they can dilute the shareholders and dilute the voting rights and governance rights of different shareholders in order to protect the company and maintain its independence. So we will continue to watch this.
00:20:03.335 - 00:20:29.183, Speaker A: There is a vote scheduled for October 29th a little bit away, but that's going to be very important for the future of Bit Farms and if they do indeed get taken over by Riot or if Riot maybe loses interest or whatever happens here. I want to go to the other part of the story though, and maybe Colin, you have some follow up on what I just talked about and that's the Bit Farms and Stronghold story.
00:20:29.279 - 00:21:02.045, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the timing of this is interesting. Like you said, this has been in the works for about three years. Rumors have been circulating over the last, I would say quarter, maybe half year about it coming to the finish line and obviously it has now and the timing of this. I can't help but look at this as being almost in conversation with the Riot takeover that maybe that's not fair. I just the timing is so juicy that you can't help but speculate. And to your point Will, I don't know anything about corporate governance.
00:21:02.045 - 00:21:59.933, Speaker B: I don't know anything about how any of these takeovers work or shareholder rights or anything like that. Like you said, there are a lot of lawyers who get paid a lot of money to make sense of these things. There are a lot of people who have spent their entire year career in finance who would who understand these things obviously a lot better than a couple of talking heads on the mining pod. That being said, I wonder my biggest question is does this merger insulate Bit Farms from the takeover a little bit? Does this give them a little padding? Will this help? How is the stock going to be restructured after the merger? What dilution will take will occur. I'm curious to see if this will do anything to help Bit Farms during this scenario which if it does it's a smart play but I think that's a topic for further discussion and further probing. Hopefully we'll have a you know a mining stock show about it soon. But Matt, you want to jump in?
00:22:00.029 - 00:22:39.259, Speaker C: I was going to say. Well a couple details to note on this is that it is expected to while is announced now close in the start Q1 of 2025. So there is a little bit of time before this is final and then just you know some things that people may also be interested in if you know they would expect to basically take on about four exhausts with this deal but if they upgraded the mining fleet it was expected to to be around 10. So just some things to consider there as kind of like some closing thoughts on this.
00:22:39.387 - 00:23:12.921, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to throw in a few more thoughts as well because this might be like our our bigger mining news pieces this week. From a standpoint with Bit Farms this does move them more into the United States. It's interesting that this deal took three years to close. This fits in with like their profile of securing cheap alternative sources of energy. They're very green from their energy sources but they've also been international, not been a US focused company. Now they are like a Canadian company but they do I believe trade on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange.
00:23:12.953 - 00:23:49.481, Speaker B: So they do trade on the Nasdaq and just to highlight that, you know, so strongholds operations are in Pennsylvania and they also, they operate. Unless I'm, I'm working with outdated information. Well it's, tell me if I am. But they operate a coal refuse power plant like they own the power plant and that's where their, their bitcoin miners are. So super interesting play from, from bit farms here because not only are they going to expand their hash rate and like you said will expand into the US Currently they're only US operations I believe are in Washington. I could be wrong about that. But they're also going to have a harder infrastructure play with this.
00:23:49.481 - 00:24:02.299, Speaker B: Right. Like they will legitimately be able to have, they're going to be operating a power plant and they will have the ability to either mine with that megawatt capacity or sell to the grid because it's directly hooked up to the grid in Pennsylvania.
00:24:02.427 - 00:24:20.417, Speaker A: Yeah, they're in the PJM grid system which has been a hotter place to mine bitcoin as of late. A lot more interest than I'd say ercot. From the chatter I hear around different conferences I think people kind of know the ERCOT game at this point.
00:24:20.601 - 00:24:22.913, Speaker B: Still saturated too.
00:24:23.049 - 00:24:37.045, Speaker A: It's so possible to get like something in west Texas. I've from my understanding for like 3.5 to 4.5 cents. But I just think like people are looking a little bit elsewhere and the Ohio, Pennsylvania area has been a little bit more interesting to people.
00:24:39.385 - 00:25:12.919, Speaker B: In the competitive world of bitcoin mining, one name stands out. CleanSpark, America's Bitcoin miner. At CleanSpark, efficiency isn't just a goal, it's our standard. Our sophisticated facilities are built and led by expert teams who care about bitcoin and the communities. We work in scale, we've mastered it. Our large scale operations have set us apart in the industry. As examples of community oriented building, our track record speaks for itself.
00:25:12.919 - 00:25:26.223, Speaker B: We navigate the complexities of the new economy with precision and with skill. Continuously achieving operational milestones. Curious about how we do it? We invite you to discover the story.
00:25:26.279 - 00:25:44.363, Speaker A: Behind CleanSpark success@cleanspark.com Colin published this awesome piece in the Mining Pod newsletter. You can go to miningpod.blockspace media and you can sign up for the newsletter there or just click in today's show notes and find it. Colin, walk us through what you wrote about here.
00:25:44.499 - 00:26:19.771, Speaker B: Yeah, so just a quick overview of some Q2 numbers that the public miners published. You know these Financial reports are filed with the sec. All public companies have to do them and they usually come in about a month and a half after a quarterly close. So we finally know how bitcoin miners are doing after the halving and it's not terrible, but it's also not very good. So a few things to highlight. So as we can kind of expect, they took a hit on their revenue. Not as much as you would expect, potentially.
00:26:19.771 - 00:26:58.875, Speaker B: A lot of that has to do with expansions from these miners. You know, CleanSpark did a really good job of acquiring new data centers, acquiring grid, although that hasn't. That wouldn't have impacted this because that happened at the end of the quarter. But they acquired some data centers in Wyoming and I want to say Georgia or Mississippi, I can't remember which one. And a lot of the other, basically every other miner expanded their hash rate over Q2 and they shored up some of that revenue hit that they took from the having. You scroll down to the next chart too. I like to take a look at this one because I think it puts a lot of the AI hype into perspective for right now.
00:26:58.875 - 00:27:37.991, Speaker B: A lot of bitcoin miners have been chasing alternative revenue streams over the last year or two. They're planting the seeds. They have not harvested the fruits of their labor yet though. As you can see, HPC and AI segments for core scientific and Hut 8 were a sliver of their revenue and those were the largest AI and HPC revenue generating business lines out of the entire bunch. So still a lot of room to grow there. And that's going to be the biggest story for some of these miners, I think, over the next two years. Can they actually make that transition happen? A lot of megawatt capacity expected to come online over the next year.
00:27:38.103 - 00:27:39.759, Speaker A: Bit dear. Let's go.
00:27:39.887 - 00:28:15.247, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's like, it's like announcing hash rate expansion plans, right? I always want to caveat this chart. This is what they report as, as miners. And of course they're going to tell you the better story instead of the worst story because they want to pump their share prices. That being said, if Bit Deer pulls off what they want to do, they will become the largest bitcoin miner by megawatt capacity at 2 gigawatts at the end of 2025. They have even more planned for 2026. And if Riot and Mera execute as well, they will have a gigawatt. And who knows, maybe Core will join the gigawatt club at the end of next year too.
00:28:15.247 - 00:28:17.735, Speaker B: I have a hard time believing they won't if they're still solvent.
00:28:17.895 - 00:28:20.903, Speaker C: Just hearing the gigawatt club is wild.
00:28:21.079 - 00:28:36.511, Speaker A: Gigawatt club, yeah. It's kind of cool. So, yeah, I'll go back to that chart. We can sit on for a second. Marathon Core will probably get there soon. Riot is going to have. I mean, their campus is going to be one gigawatt at Corsicana and then.
00:28:36.543 - 00:28:44.535, Speaker B: Bit Dew and Bit Farms. This doesn't include Stronghold, so I don't know how many megawatts that power plant.
00:28:44.575 - 00:29:01.099, Speaker A: Is, so they'll have just under 1 gigawatt, I believe. I think 950 is what the article said. And then it said they have like 1.6 in the pipeline, which I don't really know what that means, and I don't know if that includes the 900 megawatts, but, yeah, I mean, everyone's getting big now.
00:29:01.147 - 00:29:02.923, Speaker D: Like really big fat.
00:29:03.099 - 00:29:04.563, Speaker B: Yeah, getting fat and happy.
00:29:04.659 - 00:29:15.659, Speaker C: I will. Ben Gagnon in the Bit Farms release said that he anticipated the energy portfolio to go to 950 megawatts.
00:29:15.747 - 00:29:40.843, Speaker B: Okay. So, you know, we can round up for. For Core and Bit Farms. You know, they're basically at that gigawatt club. And one other thing to highlight, though, megawatt expansion doesn't exactly mean that you're using those megawatts as effectively as other miners. Perfect example of this is hive. They have the smallest megawatt footprint of all of the miners in our update, and they are also the most efficient of turning those megawatts into revenue.
00:29:40.843 - 00:30:12.333, Speaker B: This is an important chart. It's more important, too, to look at profit margins. I'll do EBITDA next quarter, I think, but going to profit margins, if you'll scroll down to, I think the last chart we'll hit on, because the cash and debt position isn't as interesting. Hash cost. So this is a metric that we use to measure how much a bitcoin miner spends on the hash rate they produce. It is inversely related to hash price, which is how much revenue they can produce from a unit of hash rate. And this is from our friends at the Miner mag.
00:30:12.333 - 00:30:41.333, Speaker B: And it includes both direct operating costs, payroll and SGA and financing costs. And the scary thing about this chart, this is perhaps the most terrifying chart in all of bitcoin mining right now. If you're invested in these public equities, only Bit Deer is currently mining profitably under. Under hash price of $43 for pet ash per day. Now hash price is at like $50 for pet ash per day. Given the recent fee bump, that's going to come back down. That's a blip.
00:30:41.333 - 00:31:09.867, Speaker B: So let's just assume that hash price is around $43 better hash per day. Only Bit Deer has a positive hash cost currently. That's terrifying. Everyone should think about what they're doing when they smash buy on a bitcoin mining stock. You're going to need bitcoin's price to surge for this, for this to change. At least that's the easiest route out. The other things that these bitcoin miners can do is they can lower their SGNAs and they can also improve their fleet efficiencies.
00:31:09.867 - 00:31:30.059, Speaker B: Improving power costs is more difficult than those two. So I don't want to scare everyone. They'll be fine, but like, something's got to change over the next year. You know, they can, they can eat this for a while because they have really good cash positions and they can always sell equity. But ideally you want to see those hash costs improving.
00:31:30.187 - 00:31:39.885, Speaker A: So we always say in the mining pod, lower your sgna unless you are sponsoring the mining pod and then increase that line item on your sgna.
00:31:40.265 - 00:31:42.085, Speaker B: Matt, you were trying to jump in there.
00:31:42.585 - 00:31:52.285, Speaker C: The great equalizer and mining is the difficulty and adjustment. I just want to remind everyone out there that everything will be okay.
00:31:53.025 - 00:31:54.561, Speaker B: That's a good balance. Perspective.
00:31:54.633 - 00:31:55.605, Speaker C: Some of you.
00:31:57.025 - 00:32:17.615, Speaker A: It will. Yeah, I don't know about that. It'll. Okay, let's go to this last one. This one again is just to kind of piss people off, to be honest. And it says IMF blog that came out. I'll intro it really quick and then throw it over to Colin for a Alex Jones esque take on why this is dumb but want us to reduce our carbon footprint.
00:32:17.615 - 00:32:59.303, Speaker A: Carbon emissions from AI and crypto are surging and tax policy can help subtext. Crypto mining. Data centers now account for 2% of global electricity use and nearly 1% of global emissions. And their footprint has grown, growing. The authors of this piece from the IMF's Economic and Taxation division, basically saying we need to increase taxation on both crypto mining and AI data centers in order to meet different quotas or goals for global warming. The one for the tax increase for crypto money was quite a lot. 85% average electricity costs for miners is what they're saying.
00:32:59.303 - 00:33:23.599, Speaker A: Levying a tax like this would raise an annual government revenue of $5.2 billion globally and reduce annual emissions by 100 million tons or about the emissions of Belgium. So we've seen these things float out quite a bit. This is like the IMF thing to trigger everybody and this is not policy. It's just a blog. But want to get some thoughts as we close out here, Colin?
00:33:23.767 - 00:33:39.959, Speaker B: They want the electricity for themselves so that they can sacrifice babies to mullet. That's all they want to do. And they're going to tax us. And the globalists are going to. They're going to try to win anyway. Shout out to Alex Jones, funniest person alive. 5.2
00:33:39.959 - 00:34:08.541, Speaker B: billion annually. That would fund the federal government for what, a day? See, this is when you really look at the dollars and cents of these things. For anyone who has any financial literacy or pays attention to how much anything costs to run, especially governments. Tax policies like this are so naked in the, in the sense that you know what they're trying to do. They're just trying to hamstring the industry. Especially for bitcoin mining. Right.
00:34:08.541 - 00:35:00.563, Speaker B: They'll tax the data centers and they'll be fine. Those companies, I mean, it's not a good thing, but they can stomach that a little bit more. If you tax bitcoin miners at whatever ridiculous rate they were just trying to levy, so many of these mines are going to go out of business. A lot of the public companies that would be subject to something like this would have a huge headache on with regards to their operating costs. Yeah, I mean, I obviously lean towards a more libertarian viewpoint here. I don't want the imf, you know, unelected, you know, council of bureaucrats basically levying for taxes that do nothing but harm an industry that's not doing anything to harm anyone else. I, you know, I don't know what else to say about this other than trying to tax these companies based on their carbon emissions is just ridiculous.
00:35:00.563 - 00:35:52.287, Speaker B: It's authoritarian and it doesn't even make any sense because they're not the ones producing the carbon emissions. Those are the power, those are the grid operators, those are the power plant operators. If you really want to reduce emissions, go to them, have them, I don't know, build more nuclear. I mean, that's the thing about this too, is none of this really matters because ultimately, if I don't know, Sorry, I'm going. I sound like Peter Thiel on Joe Rogan. There's so many different routes that you can go with this, but at the end of the day, you're not going to lower carbon emissions by taxing these companies. You're going to lower carbon emissions by deploying nuclear, by setting up solar and micro grids in neighborhoods where it makes sense, and by deploying natural gas in place of coal.
00:35:52.287 - 00:36:04.155, Speaker B: But none of this matters if China doesn't do the same thing and they're building coal. So I don't know. It seems dumb. I hope it doesn't pan out. I'm tired of these unelected bureaucrats trying to create rules for the rest of us.
00:36:04.455 - 00:36:18.935, Speaker A: I love this. I think we can close on that note. Honestly. The IMF will continue to put these out and we will continue to react to them. They're just having fun. Charlie is not here, so we'll close out with you too. It was fun.
00:36:18.935 - 00:36:27.415, Speaker A: Colin about it. I know I miss him, but we'll see him on Slack in a second. Call on Matt. Anything else before we close out?
00:36:27.875 - 00:36:38.323, Speaker B: My final thoughts? There is. There are legitimately a group of people in this world that think throwing taxes at the government will solve problems. No.
00:36:38.419 - 00:36:38.723, Speaker D: Go.
00:36:38.779 - 00:36:50.545, Speaker B: Go get help. Read up on history. Like, I mean, just, you know, go. Go touch grass. Go get spiritual. Go get a hobby. Politics should not be a hobby, everyone.
00:36:50.545 - 00:36:52.705, Speaker B: That's. That's my final thought.
00:36:53.045 - 00:37:09.046, Speaker A: The Rocky Mountain Libertarian from Tennessee is speaking up on the chat. Okay, we'll see you guys next week. If you enjoyed the show, go check out our interviews. We post those on Tuesdays and we put on news roundups on Fridays. We have other stuff as well. Bitcoin season two. Check that out on YouTube.
00:37:09.046 - 00:37:14.665, Speaker A: YouTube or the courtshow. You can find all this and more at Blockspace Media. See you next week.
