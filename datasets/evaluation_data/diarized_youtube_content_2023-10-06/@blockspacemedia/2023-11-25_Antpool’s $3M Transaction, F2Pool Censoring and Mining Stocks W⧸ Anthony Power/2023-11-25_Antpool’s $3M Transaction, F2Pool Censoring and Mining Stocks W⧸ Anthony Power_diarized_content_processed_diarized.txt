00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.606, Speaker A: Welcome back to the mining pod. We got a news roundup and an Anthony Power show. This is a pretty action packed episode for your Saturday morning, so you're welcome. Free content, pretty good stuff. Talking about bitcoin today. As always, we're going to start off this news roundup talking about bitcoin price. What's going to happen post CZ at Binance hash rate going up.
00:00:22.606 - 00:00:46.538, Speaker A: And then we'll move over into some of the bitcoin mining news this week. Ant pool mining a huge block with a lot of transaction fees after someone may be fat fingered on a transaction. Who knows, 90 bitcoin and then f two pool censoring and then backing off of its censorship of transactions. So a lot going on as always, joined by Charlie. Matt is off this week. It's okay. It's a holiday science of.
00:00:46.538 - 00:00:48.826, Speaker A: Charlie joined me. Charlie, how you doing?
00:00:49.008 - 00:01:07.842, Speaker B: I'm fantastic. It's a good day. We had a wonderful Thanksgiving here in the US of back. Yeah, I'm back at it. What's the Black Friday today? I call it like Thanksgiving Boxing Day, where you box up all the food. After thanksgiving, it's like Christmas boxing thing. So yeah.
00:01:07.842 - 00:01:17.298, Speaker B: Ready to talk about bitcoin mining? Because it doesn't matter if half the world's on holiday, things still happen on bitcoin and so we've got to talk about it.
00:01:17.464 - 00:01:52.286, Speaker A: Bitcoin is still live, as they say. Okay, we'll go into our first topic of discussion, which is bitcoin price. It wicked up to like almost 39,000 this morning, which was fantastic. It seems like we're having some strong price action. This comes, of course, after what happened with Chengping's out. The former CEO of finance finance and the US Department of Justice came to an agreement for CZ to step down finance to take a $4 billion penalty and for CZ to get about 18 months in prison to see what the sentencing is. But that's what it looks like as of now.
00:01:52.286 - 00:02:18.054, Speaker A: So CZ is no longer the head of finance and it looks like finance has its big geopolitical headwinds or overhang out of the way now, which a lot of people are looking at. This was the final hurdle to enable us to get to a long anticipated bitcoin ETF and price action. Looks like it is anticipating that possibly occurring, maybe pricing it in, throw it over to you. What do you think about all that, man?
00:02:18.092 - 00:02:48.354, Speaker B: I've said it before. I think news events are neutral, whether we think they're good or bad. And what matters most is how the price responds, indicating whether we're in an uptrend or a downtrend. Price is up on the biggest exchange, owing $4 billion to the US government and this legendary, probably most tightness figure in all of crypto. Stepping down now. There's some game theory to this, some kind of commentary, some very interesting insights. Whether it's a good or bad thing overall, people think it's a good thing.
00:02:48.354 - 00:03:22.250, Speaker B: The price of bitcoin thinks it's a good thing. We're at the highest price of bitcoin we've had in a year and a half, certainly the highest this year. This is crazy. And it's funny because we see a little bit people talk about this on mainstream news, but I would say just boots on the ground. Again, we're at that perennial cycle where everybody in the industry knows that put your bull pants back on because it's around the corner. But the broader public hasn't filtered through the consciousness yet. So this will be interesting to watch.
00:03:22.250 - 00:03:28.510, Speaker B: When is the other shoe going to drop? And people are going to realize that it's probably game on. So we'll see.
00:03:28.660 - 00:04:12.878, Speaker A: That is the question, indeed, because there's not as much interest in bitcoin right now as obviously there was in 2021. Get a few texts from friends right now, which is always a solid indicator, but it does seem to just be people pricing in an ETF. So bitcoin's prices going back up if we break forty k, I mean, that's solid territory for a bull run from there. Okay, let's talk about the mem pool right now, which, of course, is ripping. We have been seeing sats per v byte, easily over 40 sats per v byte, and I've seen as high as, like, 200, 250. Charlie, you've probably seen it higher. This seems to be a lot of stuff to do with ordinals, like people just playing around with it, but also just typically transaction fees go up during a bull run, if we can call it a bull run yet.
00:04:13.044 - 00:04:36.578, Speaker B: Yeah. This is the confluence of everything. It's driven mainly by roles which are driven mainly by the BRC 20 fungible token standard. We've talked about that. This is largely activity in minting speculative shitcoins, mostly interested out of Asia and China. Southeast Asia. That's where all the buying is coming from for these, which is fun.
00:04:36.578 - 00:04:59.126, Speaker B: Love to see it. Miners are welcoming the fees. We saw an interesting event where we're actually seeing. I think we saw one of the highest fee rate purges, or like mempool fee rate purges. I've seen in a while. I saw 30 sats for v byte, which to the user, the listener most mempool standards policy, that is. Each node has a mempool keeping all the transactions.
00:04:59.126 - 00:05:37.830, Speaker B: A lot of them start removing transactions under a certain fee rate. Once the kind of size of all the aggregate transactions get to a certain amount. And that's typically by a fee per weight unit, basically. And so we saw that reach one of the highest ever. And we saw some interesting activities. So we saw a bunch of transactions get purged and or replaced over the past couple of days. It's just a really fun time to be looking at the mempool, even from a beginner to a seasoned mempool study, or it's just a really interesting time to be watching what's happening on bitcoin.
00:05:38.650 - 00:06:06.958, Speaker A: Definitely is. I'm having a lot of fun with it. Got to pull up some charts for bitcoin mining here, so excuse me as I do that, but the interesting thing from a bitcoin mining perspective is that hash rate is just ripping right now, 500 x a hash. So, at the beginning of the year, I like to do on this podcast, guesses or estimates for what hash rate is going to be at the end of the year. Every single person was so wrong. Not even close. The most bullish number I had was around 350 from people.
00:06:06.958 - 00:06:36.650, Speaker A: And these are mining experts, right? They said like 350 end of year, and not even end of year. It's the end of November. We have another month to go, and we're at 500 x a hash. So that just tells you how competitive bitcoin is. And I think it also tells you how much there was to unwind from what happened in 2021. Like, there was so much infrastructure that was built, there were so many different projects to be completed, and now it's actually coming online and has been a little bit for the last few weeks. And then also, like preorders for s other units, those things are starting to ratchet up.
00:06:36.650 - 00:06:43.310, Speaker A: So it looks like we might get to that 1000 x a hash. Yeah. Rather than later.
00:06:43.460 - 00:07:33.710, Speaker B: It's wild. I mean, just for some comparison, I think one of the reasons a lot of us, myself included, under predicted to the downside is because even when we saw the crazy ripping hash price in 2020 and through the beginning of 2022, we didn't see, like, miners weren't able to get online and scale quickly enough. We're actually seeing, I believe it's a higher rate of increase here during a bear or flat market than we saw during the height of the bull so it is very indicative that I think miners are able to get on quicker at larger scale. The industry has really improved its execution rate, and I think that really says something. So maybe this will create a next cycle of people predicting too much to the upside. Who knows?
00:07:35.330 - 00:08:02.706, Speaker A: I'm here for it. I'm here for it. Hash rate or hash price, I should say, is doing better. Like over $90 per PETA hash, but it's still not great compared to what we've seen previously. Okay, we will leave that there, and let's go over to our two other subjects, the first one being, let's talk about this crazy thing that happened with ant pool yesterday. They mined a bitcoin block with $3.2 million in transaction fees.
00:08:02.706 - 00:08:19.754, Speaker A: You're going to throw this up from our friends over at the minor mag. Be sure to bookmark their website. They do great stuff over there. Ampool mines bitcoin block with $3.2 million in fees. It is unclear if the fees are intentional or due to an error. 91.4
00:08:19.754 - 00:09:02.410, Speaker A: BTC as a subsidy or fee there. That's just insane. And so I've been seeing this kind of circulate some mining chats, wondering what happened here? How did this happen? Udi Wertheimer, the Taproot Wizards co founder and longtime arch nemesis of the bitcoin maxis, made a joke about this. Like, maybe he made this block, he fat fingered transaction. There was some speculation around. There was like an ornament ear or something like that, but it looks like something else. And there's a lot of different ideas for this, right? Like, you could throw it out there being like, money laundering, where someone was just trying to move money through bitcoin network and just paid a lot of fees and they knew where it was going.
00:09:02.410 - 00:09:27.330, Speaker A: That's extremely speculative. There's ideas about, like, maybe this was ant pool playing around with the pool fees game and trying to outbalance foundry. They're in a race with foundry right now to kind of claim the top spot. So maybe there's something with that. There's a lot of games you can play with this and this fees. One was quite interesting. Of course, it all comes down to, can you back out? Who is transacting in this block? Which is sort of difficult to do.
00:09:27.480 - 00:10:06.400, Speaker B: Throw it over to you, Charlie, man, this could. It's probably a very nuanced issue. There's a lot of speculation. What's funny is I think the kind of normie mining Twitter scene seems to just kind of hand wave and say, oh, money laundering but I think I'm going to go with none of the above and say it's probably somebody experimenting with something and made some big accent because there's no change output. It has all the hallmarks of someone being a little more hands on with their transaction, broadcasting and construction. And there was also, I believe, RBF. So at one fee rate, it's even crazier or higher fee rate.
00:10:06.400 - 00:10:38.600, Speaker B: This is a very interesting thing. It is the highest block in dollar terms, block reward in dollar terms ever. So that's its historic flag planted. Yeah, this is really interesting. I feel bad for whoever might be on the bad end of this, but bitcoin continues to produce blocks. We'll see.
00:10:39.130 - 00:11:05.390, Speaker A: Yeah. The interesting thing here, of course, is what happened with Paxos earlier in the year where Paxos was working with PayPal. Paxos accidentally sent a very large bitcoin transaction with like a $500,000 fee. F two pool is the one who landed that block. And f two pool held the fee for a little bit and then, I believe, gave it back to Paxos after a little finangling on Twitter. Ant pool doesn't seem like they're going to reimburse this block. I don't see that anyone's going to come forward and claimed it as theirs.
00:11:05.390 - 00:11:20.258, Speaker A: Maybe there's some backdoor negotiations going on. That's, of course, very possible. But if you're mining with, like, maybe you had a little bit of a higher bump or I guess ant pool took it all. I don't know. I don't know what structure.
00:11:20.354 - 00:11:25.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I don't think it was. That's. That's my definitive assessment.
00:11:25.858 - 00:11:50.794, Speaker A: Same. Yeah, that would be half of their startup raise that they just concluded. So that'd be a little bit much money. Yeah, well, more to watch on that front. At the very least, bitcoin is active again, and that story says. So let's go over to f two pool. Talk about censorship on f two pool on November 20.
00:11:50.794 - 00:12:41.294, Speaker A: So earlier this week, six of sanctioned transactions were noticed to be missing from three different pools. Foundry via BTC and f two pool. This is according to a blog post from zero XB ten C bitcoin developer out there who makes a lot of great projects and actually is a great follow. On Twitter, they noticed that these transactions, which were occurring from August till now or like September to, were some of these bitcoin blocks were not including certain transactions, and those transactions were linked to addresses that were sanctioned by OFAC. After doing some investigation, it looks like the foundry and the ViaBTC transactions were not including those blocks for various reasons pertaining to how bitcoin works. So those two companies were not on the hook for practicing censorship. But does look like f two pool was doing so.
00:12:41.294 - 00:13:23.098, Speaker A: And it was later confirmed by Chun Wang, who is the founder and CEO of F two Pool. And he went online and talked about it, kind of defended himself for a little bit, and then later went back and changed his stance on it after walking back the censorship protocol. And then he also put out this tweet saying, a censorship resistant system must be designed to resist censorship at the protocol level, rather than relying on each participant to act consciously and refrain from censorship. The Internet and TCP IP have failed. This bitcoin should learn from this failure. Any takes on this giving you a lot of pool questions this week, which you work at a bitcoin pool.
00:13:23.194 - 00:13:43.460, Speaker B: Yeah. And I work and represent luxur. Yeah. This is a nuanced and complex issue. As an individual, I think what Jun said is correct. I think the protocol should be the one to enforce the neutrality of.
00:13:46.490 - 00:13:46.902, Speaker C: Are.
00:13:46.956 - 00:14:38.550, Speaker B: Most of these are real companies located in real jurisdictions, and we have to make realistic. Yeah. OFAC compliance. While I believe bitcoin should be a neutral money, the individuals who act on it and the companies are not necessarily neutral. So I did like to see that f two pool listened, you could say listened to the community and pulled off the OFAC compliant software. I thought that was a really interesting decision, but we'll just have to see where this goes as we enter into an era where the different regulatory bodies are more in tune with actually how bitcoin works, and they have to design laws and legal structures for it. We're going to see more conversations like this.
00:14:38.550 - 00:14:53.500, Speaker B: There's going to be a lot more scrutiny on block construction and inclusion or omittance from that. So I think this is probably one of the first of many stories we'll see over the next few years.
00:14:54.430 - 00:15:19.378, Speaker A: I think so as well. I mean, this brings us back to the marathon digital story from 2021, where they were also filtering out transactions, of course, with the OFAC standards. Those addresses are out there. We know about them, but you don't necessarily have to do it. It's not a compliance that you have to do as of now, maybe in the future. And there's concerns about that, and that's why there's a raise to getting stratum v two up and all these other ideas for decentralizing the bitcoin mining layer. But you don't have to do it now.
00:15:19.378 - 00:15:30.054, Speaker A: You're basically only doing it because maybe you're concerned that OPAC might go after you or you want to be compliant ahead of time. So that's something just to watch and kind of put out there.
00:15:30.172 - 00:16:34.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the other thing is, I think regulators and legislators tend to be a little bit laggards behind the game theory conversation about bitcoin. So they're kind of understanding that, oh, these pools, they produce these blocks, and we can try to tell them to do or not do these things. But I don't think that kind of the game theory nature of bitcoin transaction inclusion has fully distilled into everybody yet, because theoretically anybody should be able to put a transaction into bitcoin eventually because someone else who is a miner in a different country who would process or include that transaction in the block is still going to happen. So it's kind of an old conversation now within bitcoin adversarial thinking land, but it doesn't make sense to do this for countries or jurisdictions because it's going to happen anyway and you're only shooting yourself in the foot. We'll see how this plays out. It's going to be a very interesting few years.
00:16:35.790 - 00:17:12.358, Speaker A: Okay, we'll close it out there. Next up, we have Anthony Power, who joined us earlier in the week to talk about bitcoin mining stocks.

00:18:07.634 - 00:18:17.100, Speaker A: On Today's show, we're joined by Anthony Power. As always, Anthony, welcome back to the show. Excited to talk about monthly mining metrics with you today and some Q three numbers that we also have.
00:18:17.870 - 00:18:19.820, Speaker C: Great video, will. Thanks for having me.
00:18:20.510 - 00:18:47.122, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's just dive right into it. Lot going on in terms of bitcoin fees right now, we've seen some bitcoin blocks have rewards of like eight plus bitcoin, which has been awesome. Sats per v byte. Seen like upwards of 250 sats per v byte. So bitcoin miners are really enjoying those fees. Maybe not people transacting with bitcoin, but we're rooting for miners here. So that's kind of made a cheery picture for the current moment.
00:18:47.122 - 00:19:03.766, Speaker A: But we're going to go back to October and then also look at some of the Q three numbers that have come out from a few bitcoin miners. And we'll just start from the beginning. I'll throw up some charts, and Anthony, you can direct me as we go through them. Okay, so we'll start with some October numbers. Handing it over to you, Anthony.
00:19:03.958 - 00:19:53.900, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So what we saw in October, we saw the global hash rate continue to increase in its move towards all time highs every month, literally this year. What that means for miners is that when you have more hash rate on the net, the difficulty will end up increasing, because with more hash rate, they solve the block in a quicker time. So the difficulty factor then kicks in to get it back to where it should be, which is a block every 10 minutes. So we did see the difficulty change by about 9% from the start to the end of the month. But overall, that was closer to a 4% average for the whole month. What that means is that miners were producing less bitcoin itself.
00:19:53.900 - 00:20:53.854, Speaker C: However, what we did see it from the end of September to the end of October, we saw a spike in the bitcoin price of over 30%. So where they were mining less bitcoin, they were actually achieving greater revenues. And so literally every miner achieved a higher revenue for the month of October than he did for the month of September. But their production was actually, in nearly all cases, apart from three riot, argo and one of the miner. The rest of the miners are actually producing less bitcoin. From a highlight perspective, we saw marathon continuing now with a 19.2 x of energized hash rate, producing over 1200 bitcoin, yet again slightly below their all time high, which is about 1245, I believe, but still a good total.
00:20:53.854 - 00:21:42.086, Speaker C: And indications because of what's happening now with the transaction fees, which you alluded to at the start of the discussion, that may well break the all time high for marathon in the month of November because they have four extra hash of installed hash rate that is yet to be energized at their garden city site in Texas. So indications from the company said that was likely to happen towards the end of the month. So we'll hopefully see some of those miners come online, increase their hash rate further. They're still progressing well. Marathon in the UAE, so that's on track. They're reaching all the milestones there and they expect to by the end of the year have achieved their 7.2 x hash.
00:21:42.086 - 00:22:08.194, Speaker C: And they haven't really stopped there. They're just constantly looking for other sites. So now they're looking at Paraguay. They visited Africa, so a number of sites in Africa. So plenty of potential opportunities for those miners who are prepared to move into other continents where there is cheap renewable energy. So marathon are making this, strive to get to that 30 x ash, which is their sort of like next target. And once they achieve that, we'll see another target in place for them.
00:22:08.194 - 00:23:00.950, Speaker C: They just seem to be getting their act together now in 2023, whereas 2022 was a challenging year for them, but they realized, probably looked at some of the things that happened previously, made amendments to that, and it looks like they're all full steam ahead. When we're looking at sort of like production, it's going to be like the usual suspects again, who have produced well over the month. And actually in the month of October, we literally had five miners who were all within fractions of a percentage of each other. So we had the likes of Sato technology, who fractionally came out just ahead of iris energy. We also had hive digital, we had bit farms, and we had DMG as well. So those five had good production numbers for the month. From a utilization perspective.
00:23:00.950 - 00:23:56.470, Speaker C: Again, we're looking at Iris Energy, followed by Sato with bit farms and hive also in them. Sort of like top four slots. So, yeah, a good month. Argo blockchain had a better month than previous months. Now we're starting to see some of these miners that were sort of towards the bottom of the tables and a month to month average starting to improve month by month we're seeing better results month by month. Not where we want to see them, but they're getting towards the levels where we'd like to see them more often. And they've done a job of trying to keep the cost down, having the financial pressures they've gone through over the last sort of twelve months, having to give up their site at Helios, look at massive cost reduction because they still have a significant amount of debt to finance, and so cost is important for them.
00:23:56.470 - 00:24:46.118, Speaker C: But it was good to see that they had a reasonably good update for October. Their results come out and I'll be reviewing their results over this next three or four days, and we'll talk through some of the results I have reviewed towards the end of the podcast. But yeah, from an October overview, a good month. There was a number of miners still benefiting from the energy curtailment in Texas. So we had the likes of Riot, we had the likes of Cypher, we had the likes of Iris Energy, Argo, blockchain and bitdeer. Those five miners all benefiting from curtailing in the month of October. And you're not going to get the same levels of rewards as they were getting.
00:24:46.118 - 00:25:39.606, Speaker C: Some of them were getting between June and September. So those four months are the really big months where there's a lot more curtailment, but the actual benefits outweigh the fact they've hail. So we saw the likes of riot in previous months earning. I think in one month it was over $30 million of credits towards their future energy bills by not mining. But in the month of October, that was back down to about two and a half million. So still a reasonably good amount. But if you look at Riot's production, look at the energy credits, it's sort of like you'd be asking the question as to could they have actually mined more and got more bitcoin mined during the month? Because they have a fixed PPA agreement for 345 sites at Windstone.
00:25:39.606 - 00:26:23.960, Speaker C: So that gives an opportunity to keep the machines going 24/7 but Jason will always articulate that they do look at all the indicators and they always look at where the best value can be achieved. So whether it is to mine or wish to curtail. So they are using these strategies really well. And when we come to talk about their last quarter's financial updates, it'll become more evident as to what they've been doing. So there you go, there's a table for rank by production. So Sato technology coming out top, but you can start to see now, actually there's very little between sort of like the top 1011 miners. They're all sort of, and they should be all producing a similar amount.
00:26:23.960 - 00:27:03.474, Speaker C: It's about keeping the machines online, keeping them service maintained in good facilities. What stands out one minor from another? It's not just plugging in a machine and just leaving it for the month. You have to manage these machines. They've got software that's managing these machines. They know when a machine is not operating at the optimum level, they can go in and maintain that machine. And so that's what we get the consistency from some of the miners. Iris energy, high bit farms and cleanspart are generally always in that top four position there.
00:27:03.474 - 00:27:37.774, Speaker C: And they're in there for a reason, because they just seem to do things well from a production perspective. Now, that doesn't account for anything like the cost of energy they're using. That's a separate metric. And so you never take one metric by itself. So this is one chart where these miners do well on. But if we were to look at the cost per mining a bitcoin, it might show a totally different perspective on some of the miners. And I know, looking at that chart now, I can tell you from what I've looked at from the q, three financials, that riot can produce the cheapest bitcoin of all those miners on there.
00:27:37.774 - 00:27:45.490, Speaker C: So having not the greatest production, what they do produce, they do produce very cheaply.
00:27:45.830 - 00:28:21.082, Speaker A: Yeah. Some takeaways from this for myself is what you mentioned here with the energy production costs. You can see that in the numbers here by the rank, by exahash, which is a really interesting metric for looking at how much bitcoin you can actually mine. If you have a set amount of exahash on the shelves, what is your expectation? And you can see those energy strategies playing out. The other thing, of course, being that difficulty was really tough last month in October, and that ratcheted up, increased or decreased everyone's production. Luckily, we're seeing bitcoin mining fees start to eke into that. That was one takeaway from the recent summit down in Fort Worth.
00:28:21.082 - 00:28:54.758, Speaker A: That was this month at the north american blockchain. Summit is a lot of these bitcoin miners were very happy that fees were going up because sort of padding the difficulty change. Right. So I'm interested to see if bitcoin miners continue to become more interested in things like ordinals and inscriptions or L2s, stuff like that, because it's going to help out their monthly production, which flows right into their stock price and flows right into their ability to make other purchases for machines or sites or whatnot. So that is one takeaway from me, but I'll hand it back over to you for the next metric that you want to take a look at.
00:28:54.924 - 00:30:14.266, Speaker C: So bitcoin sold as a part of their production. This is an interesting metric because it really tells you how the miners are paying for their operational and capital expenditure going forward. We've talked in the past about debt being not the way forward at the moment because of interest rates and because of the uncertainty in the debt markets and the issues that a number of miners have had during that 2021, 2022 period where they took out loans at the height of the bull run and then had to sort of service those loans as the bitcoin price was dropping and their collateral was dropping in value. And so now miners are looking at, for the last sort of twelve months, they've been looking at selling bitcoin on a more regular basis. And looking at that graph there, the majority of miners are selling literally all their production now on a monthly basis. Interestingly, one of the miners that has one of the largest, hoddles hut eight, they actually sold a significant amount in October. They still have, I think, over 9000 bitcoin on the balance sheet, but it was effectively over three times their monthly production for October.
00:30:14.266 - 00:31:14.414, Speaker C: And bear in mind, their monthly production for the last few months has been significantly low. They probably had more than their fair share of bad luck in 2023. They had the issues with their energy provider, Alidas in Canada, Ontario, and they've also had the issues with mining machines at Drumheller, which they're trying to resolve at the moment. But on a positive note today, the announcement from USBTC to say that their shareholders had unanimously and overwhelmingly voted for the merger, that's a positive note for Hute. The SEC approved it, I think, a couple of weeks ago. So I think it's all steam ahead now for the merger and I think they're looking at a date around about the 30 November. So in the next week or so that merger taking place and the synergies of those two companies, they bring different skill sets to the table and I think there'll be some really good synergies.
00:31:14.414 - 00:32:22.506, Speaker C: They'll be able to reduce certain level of costs, but hope will then be able to utilize some of the USBT sites to get their miners in there and start getting that production where it is and start getting that company back to where we saw it in the heights during 2021. I mean, at the moment today, I think Hut's market capitalization is a little over 400 million, but in 2021 we saw it reach two and a half billion. So there's a long way to go. But this is a good step for them and I'm sure we'll see lots more updates coming out explaining what's going to happen. The two companies joined together now have got a significant amount of hash rates. Certainly that sort of keeps them in that group, along with Iris Energy, with Wolf, with Cypher, in that sort of y classes like the mid tier. So they'll have a significant amount and they'll have facilities whereby they can probably expand quicker than some of the other miners because they'll have infrastructure there already.
00:32:22.506 - 00:33:16.022, Speaker C: So it's a very positive day for hut eight. Let's not think it's going to change instantaneously. We've still got the November update to come out and we're not expecting it to be a brilliant update because they're still using the sites in Canada. But hope in 2024, as we approach the halving, they can really start to get where they need to, maybe make some use of cheaper mining machines on the market to grow some hash rate to replace machines and get production where it needs to. Bit digital as well. They've been generally selling within their production, so growing their hoddle bit by bit. But if you remember bit digital, over a month ago, they announced the purchase of a significant amount of gpus for their AI service that they're going to start providing.
00:33:16.022 - 00:33:51.702, Speaker C: And so I'm assuming some of that 378 bitcoin was used to start paying down some of the capital costs of that decision. So that's not totally unexpected. But if you look across the rest, there, literally most of the miners are selling 100%. Marathon only sold 67%. Bit farm is at 86. And Cleanspark, who've had a few months now where they sold very little, sold a little bit more than they have in the last three months, but it's still within their production. They still were adding to their bitcoin treasury, which is a good sign.
00:33:51.702 - 00:34:42.630, Speaker C: That gives them a bit more liquidity going into the halving, because you're going to need that liquidity, not just from a cash flow perspective, to last that three or four months or five months until the bitcoin price goes. But actually from an opportunities perspective, if something comes along that maybe they can take advantage of. So machines come into the market after the halving, they're in a position to do that and do it quickly because you can liquidate bitcoin instantaneously, although it's not classed as a cash and cash equivalent. It effectively is because you can change it for cash in a day and that should be really part of the definition of cash and cash equivalent. So good for them. But yeah, if we looked at this graph a year ago, it would look totally different from what it does now. The miners have started to realize they have to start selling some of their production as we go through.
00:34:42.630 - 00:34:47.110, Speaker C: But four or five still got a reasonable amount of hoddle.
00:34:47.770 - 00:35:22.738, Speaker A: I want to go back to the hut eight us bitcoin merger. Obviously a juggernaut is being made here. If it does go through, and it looks like it has basically gone through at this point, that would give hut eight access to numerous sites within the US. They've mostly only operate in Canada. That would enable them to grow their hash rate quite a bit. But on the flip side, that also give us bitcoin access to all this hoddle that Hut has had for some time and perhaps pay off some of that debt that they have accrued from their numerous deals. They went on a spending spree from 2021 until 2023.
00:35:22.738 - 00:35:53.680, Speaker A: They entered into deals with compute north after the fall. Compute north, and it's chapter eleven. They purchased some assets from it and from its overlying top company. That was the lending company here, which was generate capital. And then they also entered into agreement with Fahrenheit, a new company being spun out of Celsius to be able to mine. Now, we don't know what's happening with the Celsius Fahrenheit ordeal. It still looks like it's being held up by the SEC, but at the very least, we know that us bitcoin has some debt going to toss it over to you.
00:35:53.680 - 00:36:00.894, Speaker A: What do you think about the debt? Do you have a number off the top of your head for what that value is? Trying to find it right now and I actually couldn't find it.
00:36:00.932 - 00:36:29.560, Speaker C: But yeah, I don't value the debt. But what I would say is that you're quite right. The hoddle that huds have got and I think it's like just over 9000 coins with a value of about $315,000,000. That was as at the end of October. And the bitcoin price has slightly increased from the nearly 35,000. I think at the moment it's about 37,000. So there's another four or 5% to add on to that.
00:36:29.560 - 00:37:19.794, Speaker C: What we've seen some companies start to do is also look to use their bitcoin to get to raise capital. Use the bitcoin as like a bitcoin backed loan. So they're not selling the bitcoin, but they're using it to raise capital. So if there's an expectation that people believe the bitcoin price will continue its rise and through the halving, that might be an option that's open to them to raise capital on the back of having that large hoddle, I believe they have some of that hoddle is used as collateral at the moment. So it's not all totally unrestricted. There is a restricted element to that hoddle, but they've still got a significant amount of unrestricted. So you're quite right, as a one whole company, they have a number of options available for them.
00:37:19.794 - 00:37:30.122, Speaker C: And yeah, it looks like it's a joining of two companies that bring different skill sets and I'm sure we'll see the synergies come through in the next twelve months.
00:37:30.256 - 00:38:00.818, Speaker A: Well, those are some great thoughts there. Want to move over to some quarter three numbers? We've obviously gone through a lot already, but there is more financials to talk through because it is that season of the year. We financial results for bitfarm, cipher mining, marathon and right here talk us through some of these numbers because they can look a little freaky at first, but when it comes down to it, it's the art of depreciation which yourself as a chartered accountant can walk us through quite easily.
00:38:00.994 - 00:38:47.702, Speaker C: Yeah, let's be honest, three of those four companies over the three and the nine month periods that are shown there made an accounting loss. There's no getting away from. It's an accounting loss. Marathon made a profit, but marathon made a profit on the strength that they were able to dilute 31 million shares and reduce their loan notes, I think over 400 million loan notes. And so there was a benefit of the interest of about 80 million. So if that hadn't occurred, they would have been in losses as well over those periods as well. So what I tend to do when I look at the financial results, depreciation, yes, it's a true cost.
00:38:47.702 - 00:39:32.820, Speaker C: Stock compensation is a true cost and the impairment of assets are also true cost. But these companies run on cash. They have to be cash flow positive. So I tend to look more from a cash perspective and some people don't appreciate that and they want to include the depreciation. I would include depreciation if all the miners were consistent in the depreciation methods they use to depreciate assets. But the trouble is they're using different policies, they're using different years, different amounts. And so you can't really do a fair comparison, Riot had 190,000,000 of depreciation in the nine months of 2023.
00:39:32.820 - 00:40:26.370, Speaker C: Had they not had that level of depreciation, they would have been profitable in both full year and last quarter. And all the miners do this. So if you look at the bottom column there, it's the adjusted EBITDA. So that takes away depreciation, it takes away interest payments, it takes away the one off charges. So stock compensation and any one off charges, it doesn't include those. And if you look at the numbers, then actually you see more positive numbers across the bottom. So that tells me that they're able to sort of like they are managing as companies during this period where the bitcoin price, although it's risen in 2023, it's still probably 40% down to where it was in 2021.
00:40:26.370 - 00:41:17.042, Speaker C: So we've still got a way to go to get to some of those closer to those highs from that year. But it shows that they are, from a cash perspective, more positive. If we look at the next slide, I take this slide and I'm open, transparent. I only use the cash costs here. So this slide tells me how many bitcoin they mined during the nine months of the year, how much mining revenue, what were the cash costs associated with that? And what that then drives is it tends to drive a cash cost per bitcoin mined. So then you can sort of start to that and actually compare the miners, because the miners have so many different variables. So you're going to have different variables in the fact that miners pay different rates of energy costs.
00:41:17.042 - 00:41:40.960, Speaker C: They will have different levels of staffing in their organization. Some will maybe very lean, some maybe have big teams. I think riot. Three 4500 staff in their teams. Marathon digital, less than 50. Those are the two big miners. Market cap is over 2 billion, but one's got seven times more staff than the other one.
00:41:40.960 - 00:42:49.922, Speaker C: Now, marathon are very lean because they use host companies for all their miners, so you don't need staff on site. So most of the marathon staff will be probably senior roles, senior management roles, working more in the sort of like the headquarters rather than on sites. They may have individual people on sites who are just overlooking what's going on, but the sites are run by the host companies and then are controlled by the host companies. So he doesn't need to have. Right staff, sorry, marathon staff there, but they may have one or two at some of the sites there, but they've only got to like 48 staff in total, so they're quite thin on the ground. When we get down to looking at the gross mining margin, I've also incorporated for those miners who've acknowledged an energy credit in their accounts, to highlight that as it won't be taken off this period, it's taken off future periods. But just to show what the energy credit value is, I've included it as a reduction in the energy price here.
00:42:49.922 - 00:43:23.790, Speaker C: So although in their accounts it's not included, it's always included in future mining. So if you get a credit now, it pays your next bill off. You don't get the current bill reduced, it pays off towards your next bill. But just to show you an awareness of what then credits look like, if you look at the cipher mining. So in the nine months of the year, they achieved nearly 8.5 million in energy credits. So a significant amount of energy credits, like 10% of all of the revenue, is like energy credits.
00:43:23.790 - 00:43:58.994, Speaker C: So that's a good strategy. When we move across to riot, riot actually achieves something like 66 million in energy credits. But riot have three businesses, and I do apportion costs. And the revenues are already segmentally reported by riot. They show by businesses and they show their direct cost by businesses, but I apportion their energy in the same way they apportion cost as well. So I've not took the whole of the energy credits here. And so that 42 million reflects just the self mining element.
00:43:58.994 - 00:44:29.300, Speaker C: So it's trying to be more accurate when you're doing a comparison. And then we look at the normal operating costs. So you look at your GNA costs, you look at your interest expenses, other operating expenses, and then you get like an operating cost and operating profit. And so looking at the margin, you can see Cypher, who have probably the cheapest energy price of all the miners that I cover. So all 15 miners that were in the report cipher have probably got the cheapest energy. I think it's around about 2.7 cents a kilowatt hour.
00:44:29.300 - 00:45:00.806, Speaker C: However, their margin at 65.8% is overtaken by riot, who have a good energy. I think it's slightly less than four cents a kilowatt hour. But the energy credits, because they were switching off and were able to sell blocks of energy back to the grid, they really benefited from that strategy. And so their gross margin for the nine months of the year was nearly 80%, 78.6%. You had marathon at 35.8, and that's a slight improvement on previous periods.
00:45:00.806 - 00:45:20.366, Speaker C: So that includes their hosting fee as well. So that should be noted. So I think their total cost per kilowatt hour is around about 6.6 cents a kilowatt hour. So obviously higher than the cipher, higher than riot, but it does include a hosting fee. Bit farms achieve 40.5 cents.
00:45:20.366 - 00:46:16.206, Speaker C: They've got a reasonably low electricity cost. They have probably, of the four miners there, they've got the lowest efficiency of all the miners. So they've got probably an older fleet and they're looking at ways to how to bring new miners in and replace that and get that efficiency down to the likes of where cleanspart, marathon and riot are. But what it shows you is it shows you that they seem to be getting more out of their machines than some of the other miners, because that's still a good gross margin to achieve. When we get down to the operating profit again, you're expecting then it's cipher, because they had such a good. Sorry, can you just move up, sorry, back up to the previous table. You expect cypher to have.
00:46:16.206 - 00:47:00.002, Speaker C: Because they had such a great gross margin, to have a good operating margin. It wasn't a fantastic operating margin. They do have significant g a costs, and those GNA costs in there are not including the stock compensation, which again, for ciphers is sort of quite high compared to their peer group. But you look at riots GNA for the size of them, that's quite low. Bit farms, they've gone through a cost management system for the last sort of 18 months. I mean, they had $160,000,000 of debt back in June 2022. That number is now down to 7.7
00:47:00.002 - 00:47:33.866, Speaker C: million. They've got rid of $153,000,000 of debt over the last sort of 1516 months. So that's an amazing turnaround. And that sets them up quite nicely going into the halving, where the interest payments, although it's shown there at interest payments of 3 million for the nine months, that will drastically drop going forward, because they haven't got a significant amount of debt left now. So that every month they've been chipping away at the debt with a number of measures, including dilution. They've diluted shares and helps pay that. But they've been selling bitcoin to pay the debt.
00:47:33.866 - 00:48:17.638, Speaker C: So they've done everything they can. And with that 7.7 million debt left and five months to go to the halving, I expect that to be zero. And then sort of that gives them a stronger position going into the halving, where they can start looking at maybe getting some more up to date machines to replace some of the older machines and get that efficiency rating down where their peer group are, cash cost per bitcoin mined. Again, three miners all around the sort of 20 to 23,000 mark. But if you look at riot there, that energy credit that they receive really brings their cost cost down significantly. And they're producing a cost of a bitcoin at 11,000.
00:48:17.638 - 00:48:53.270, Speaker C: Now going into the halving, if the bitcoin price stays at where it is now, they're going to be okay. They're not going to have as many issues as some of these other public miners because they're producing a bitcoin price at that level. And it's still going to be warm in Texas next year. They're still going to be able to utilize that energy strategy next year during the months of June through to September. So we expect to see again similar amounts of credits. And people say, oh, well, the miners are taking that. They're raising the domestic price of energy.
00:48:53.270 - 00:49:29.682, Speaker C: I mean, the miners are only utilizing 3% of all the credits that are issued in Texas. So it's a very small percentage. These big battery companies and car manufacturers and other industries in there. I think aluminium industry down in Texas like that, they get significant amounts of credit and nobody's going out there and sort of like highlighting that. But as soon as a bitcoin miner switches off the machines to help the grid, they're the bad actor in this. And hopefully we can get that education out there to say actually that they're not. They're doing a great job of stabilizing the grid, using power that nobody else wants to use.
00:49:29.682 - 00:49:55.094, Speaker C: No other industry could do what these companies can do, switch on and switch off in a matter of seconds. 100,000 miners in a location might take 30 seconds to switch the whole lot off and restart them in 30 seconds. So if you go to an aluminium smelting company or something like that, it takes months for them to get the heat to level. They need to. They can't switch off. They have to keep going round the clock. Car manufacturers.
00:49:55.094 - 00:50:19.650, Speaker C: Elon Musk is not going to stop the conveyor belt. He wants to keep producing vehicles. He's got staff working those facilities. Bitcoin miners can switch off. They don't have hundreds of staff looking after facilities. There might be two or three people at facilities, so they can do that. That's really positive at the moment, all managing to produce a bitcoin within a bitcoin price.
00:50:19.650 - 00:51:11.954, Speaker C: But we know the halving comes and the energy price itself will double overnight, effectively, because it'll take twice as long to mine a bitcoin than it does at the moment. So the GNA costs and all those will stay the same, but the actual energy price, which is your biggest cost as a miner, that will actually double once the halving occurs. So it's those miners who've got that low efficiency of miners cheap energy. And these four, to be honest, from an energy perspective, I think marathon probably is the biggest mine now, should be looking to try and negotiate better rates. But the other three, certainly in the top half of miners in terms of energy cost per kilowatt hour, and marathon will have that sort of power of the size to probably negotiate better rates going forward. So that'll be interesting. To see some of their next updates with that information, please.
00:51:11.954 - 00:51:59.234, Speaker C: So here's a quick slide of the three months we've looked at the nine month slide. This one I only want to focus on the riot column because in the three months of reporting. So that looks at the July, August, September that was in peak warm weather season for Texas and Wright, were earning significant amounts of credits. And so their gross mining profit was actually higher. So their credits were higher than the actual cost of the energy they were using to mine just over 1000 bitcoin they mined in that quarter. So they had an operating profit of 96.3%. So when you take off their overhead costs, you still got 96.3%
00:51:59.234 - 00:53:08.950, Speaker C: of profit. In their self mining business, that effectively meant the cost of mining one bitcoin during that three months. If you use the energy cost as a reduction over that period, when we know it's going to be a future period, but just using it for analysis effectively means that the cost of a bitcoin to be mined was just over $1,000, which is like, it's pretty mind blowing when you consider the other three again, sort of in that sort of low 20s, low 20 figure. And actually, if you look at the cash cost of mining bitcoin for bit farm, cipher and marathon, the reason some of those are actually higher than the nine month period, even though the bitcoin price increased, is the difficulty has been affecting the miners over the year. So the hash rate difficulty has increased, outpaced some of the rises in bitcoin. And so we can see that bit farms have got a higher cost for that three months than they have for the nine months. Even though we saw the bitcoin price rise over the months of July, August and September, production levels were lower.
00:53:08.950 - 00:53:44.494, Speaker C: And so it wasn't compensated enough with the price increase. The jump in October might turn that around. So the next quarter might be interesting if bitcoin can hold at 37, even get to like 40,000, then we might see better margins going into that quarter as we approach the halving. But I just wanted to emphasize the credits from riot in them. Three months really brought the cost down to a ridiculous amount. And I just want to emphasize, from a right perspective, they have three businesses. They have a hosting business that is not profitable, doesn't even bring a contribution to the organization.
00:53:44.494 - 00:54:39.110, Speaker C: And they have an engineering business that brings a margin of about 8%. So their self mining business, which is really positive, is actually compensating the other two services overall. So I only focus on the self mining. So whilst I'll show the self mining element, I think we ought to be saying as well, at the same time, that they have two businesses that don't bring anywhere near the same contribution in. So overall, Riot's financial results aren't seen in as great a light, but as a self miner doing everything right. And if you think about they're building up Corsicana now. So, expectation by the middle of 2024, they'll have seven and a half ex a hash there again in Texas, maybe expectations, they'll be able to do some similar strategies at Corsican that they're doing at Windstone.
00:54:39.110 - 00:54:58.902, Speaker C: But yeah, I think there's a caveat. Need to look at the whole business as well. Sometimes. This is a balance sheet extract. So this is important from a position. Having a healthy balance sheet is really important. Going through to the halving, you want to make sure from the balance sheet perspective, that you can meet your current liabilities.
00:54:58.902 - 00:55:36.498, Speaker C: And current liabilities are those bills that are due in the next twelve months of the year. So if we look at those four companies there and look at, say, bit farms there, they have $29.6 million of current liabilities. Those bills have to be paid in the next twelve months. What have they got to pay with them? Well, they've got the current assets, and the current assets of that company, that's assets that can be liquidated in the next twelve months is 83 million. So from a current ratio perspective, we want to see a number in excess of 1.0. We want to make sure that they've got sufficient amount of assets, current assets that can meet their current liabilities.
00:55:36.498 - 00:55:55.722, Speaker C: And in Bitfarm's case, they can do it as a ratio of 2.8. So 2.8 times the amount of current assets to current liabilities. That's healthy. Cipher mining again, it's over one, 1.4. That's healthy. Marathon and riot, that's a different sphere.
00:55:55.722 - 00:56:21.058, Speaker C: Now, riot at 7.23 do have a significant amount of cash on their balance sheet. It's heading towards like 300 million. And there's a reason for some of that to be on the balance sheet. They have a massive PPA agreement in Texas. And to have a PPA agreement, you have to have collateral because of the energy pricing. So you have to prove that you've got the ability.
00:56:21.058 - 00:57:02.142, Speaker C: In case of the pricing goes really higher, you have to show that you can pay the margin. And so they maintained a sort of like significant level, well over 200 million, literally every month of 2023. So there is a reason behind having that significant amount of current assets there. But liabilities, they have zero debt. So those current liabilities aren't even debt related. They're sort of like payables, things that are just happening over the next, sort of over the next few months that get paid. Marathon have a massive amount of assets compared to liabilities.
00:57:02.142 - 00:57:40.506, Speaker C: So their ratio is eleven point 33. And there's actually an argument to say marathon aren't utilizing their assets like some of the other miners are, because having a really high number, we're always saying that bit farms at 2.82 is really positive. It looks like marathon aren't utilizing some of the assets that they've got there. So they have a large amount of cash, they have a large amount of bitcoin, and they have very little current liabilities. So it looks like they're not making use of some of that. Now, obviously, a lot of it is the bitcoin hoddle.
00:57:40.506 - 00:58:35.754, Speaker C: And so their argument will be is we want to maintain that hoddle because we know, or we expect the price to increase and then we'll benefit from that there. But there's an argument that you could utilize that hoddle without selling the hoddle, so you could have a loan against the hoddle to raise and purchase machines or improve your efficiency that way. So that's a point to note. When we go down then to the next part of the table, we're looking at the enterprise value, less the bitcoin huddle. So enterprise value takes the market capitalization of the company, and it adds the debt to the company, it takes away the cash. So moving down to the next table there, we've got the enterprise value, and the enterprise value is effectively the market capitalization. You add the debt to the market capitalization, you take away the cash and cash equivalents.
00:58:35.754 - 00:59:21.406, Speaker C: And I've also deducted the bitcoin hoddle because I think that's a fair assessment. And what that does then is you can then sort of look at each miner and say, effectively, that's the true cost of buying that miner at the moment. And you can see that the most expensive miners to buy at the moment would be marathon digital at 1.8 million. And that would have been significantly higher had they not got rid of like 400 million of debt in the last few months when they diluted to do that. So that enterprise value has come down significantly because of getting, reducing those loan notes, taking that enterprise value, you can then start looking at asset valuation as well. So we can look@the.net
00:59:21.406 - 00:59:56.054, Speaker C: assets of the company and compare that to the enterprise value. And a number low in this instance is actually better. So actually, if you look at bit farms at 1.4, that's a really good indicator that when you're buying a company like bit farms with enterprise value at 272,000,000, your assets are effectively close to what the enterprise value is. And we can see from this instance there that it is very close there. The assets are 287,000,000 and enterprise value 272,000,000. So that's a good indicator.
00:59:56.054 - 01:00:30.710, Speaker C: If we look at marathon, you're paying 1.8 billion for the company and you're getting 1,060,000,000 of net assets in the company. So you're paying a premium for that company. Now, there might be a premium warranted. I mean, they've got effectively 23, 24 ex a hash plugged in, of which 19.4 is operational. So having that level of hash rate, producing bitcoin at the rate of 1200 plus per month gives you a premium.
01:00:30.710 - 01:01:10.478, Speaker C: Riot is a lower number because again, they've got no debt on the balance sheet. So they've got 1.3 billion of assets and you're effectively an enterprise value of just over 1.4. So you're getting pretty much fair close to asset value for purchasing that company. We're looking at the debt to equity ratio and all these are in good positions at the moment. So bit farms is now only nine and twelve months ago, that would have been closer to probably closer to probably 8.8. It's come down significantly.
01:01:10.478 - 01:01:42.378, Speaker C: Cipher mining, again, don't have a massive amount of debt, 23 million on the balance sheet. So there's a good debt to expedition. It's actually lower than bit farms, and bit farms only got 7 million of actual debt at the moment. Marathon zero point 31. It's a good ratio to have, so it's not anywhere that's going to be a challenge for them. Riot zero. Riot have no debt on the balance sheet.
01:01:42.378 - 01:02:22.174, Speaker C: So most of theirs, they don't have any sort of like leases or loans. They do have some sort of liabilities, but it's insignificant compared to what their value is. And then the last ratio on that sheet is the enterprise value compared with the current hash rate. And that sort of gives you like a value per current hash rate. And we look at Cypher have got. Cypher share price has done really well this year. I think after core scientific, it's probably the second highest performing share of all the sort of 15 miners that I analyze.
01:02:22.174 - 01:02:57.014, Speaker C: So they've had a really good run. And effectively, when you start looking at the enterprise value and compare that to your installed hash rate, for every one ex a hash, it's 103,000,000. If you look at the likes of marathon, it's 96 million x a hash. If you look at riot, it's 88 million x hash. But if you look at bit farms, it's only 47.4 million. And I know that if I start looking at Iris clean spark, certainly some of the smaller miners, that number will drop again.
01:02:57.014 - 01:03:10.810, Speaker C: So there is some value in some of these miners, if you look at some of the metrics and you can start formulating an idea which ones might be worth looking and doing some more due diligence.
01:03:12.750 - 01:03:21.402, Speaker A: Awesome. You want to go to the next slide? Cool. So we only have a few left. I think we should just go to the shares, if that's okay.
01:03:21.536 - 01:03:22.220, Speaker C: Cool.
01:03:22.670 - 01:03:45.442, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks for that information. Let's go down to the mining shares, which we have a metric here. And of course, if people want to take a look at this, you can just go to the compass mining website and Anthony has been doing articles with them, so you can go check out this article there. Here we have a share price year to date. We have bit farm cipher, marathon riot and bitcoin. Bit farms at 161%.
01:03:45.442 - 01:04:17.360, Speaker A: Growth cipher at 409%, marathon 168%, riot at 187% and bitcoin at 114%. So we did see that beta play that we've always talked about on the show where if bitcoin goes up, miners go up more. If bitcoin goes down, miners go down more. So you saw that play out again. Any thoughts on these specific ones? Of course, you put these in because this is like the quarterly update. So we didn't put in the other ones, but we saw other miners who also had tremendous growth in terms of their share price.
01:04:17.730 - 01:04:57.980, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what we saw is up until sort of like the middle of July, these miners were more volatile positively to bitcoin. Than bitcoin was. And so we saw some really, I think, cipher at one point was like 700%. So we have seen a massive pullback since July. And on those four miners, and actually, bitcoin itself, about three or four months ago, was only 72%. That's kept on rising to 114% as a year to date growth. But the miners over that last three month period, most of them have pulled back about 50%.
01:04:57.980 - 01:06:20.214, Speaker C: So they've lost 50% of their share. And there's a lot of questions out there from retail investors saying, we're not seeing that correlation between bitcoin price and minor price for the last three months. And there could be a multitude of reasons for that. We can look at the macroeconomics issues of the global at the moment, with likes of the war in Ukraine, what's going on in the border between Palestine and Israel. Look at what's going on for all the major economies of the world, in fact, all economies of the world, with regards to inflation, interest rates, all these are having an impact on investment. And where people, if they've got money to invest, where do they feel a more safe haven then? We've also got the fact that with the mining results coming out, and we talked about this a few minutes ago, there was only riot, who's sort of like, from a cost perspective, able to probably confidently get through the halving and still be able to produce bitcoin at lower than the actual price. Some of these other miners are going to have to sort of.
01:06:20.214 - 01:07:14.690, Speaker C: These three miners here have probably got enough cash and balance sheet support to get them through those three, four, five months. Certainly, marathon, we've already seen what they've got something like 500, 600 million on the balance sheet to utilize at their request. So they'll get through the halving and be in a position, hopefully in month four or five, if the price goes up. They'll also be in a position through the halving. If machines get switched off, they may be able to make some really strategic purchases off machines out there, and they'll be in a strong position to do that because they have a lot of resources available. Maybe not bit farms and cipher from a cash perspective, but there are some other miners who might be able to benefit. And if people's expectation, I'm seeing a lot of updates about the hash rate will probably drop 25, 30% once the halving occurs.
01:07:14.690 - 01:08:12.374, Speaker C: Because if the rewards drop and your cost of energy is then higher than the bitcoin price, you effectively have to switch off, because by mining, you're incurring more costs. By mining bitcoin, you're spending more energy than you are by not mining. And so as an accountant, I'm looking for miners to bring at least a contribution to their overhead costs. Their energy cost needs to be less than the actual rewards that they're going to receive. So if the price is 37,000 and the energy cost doubles, and some of these miners who are paying like nearly 19 20,000 energy costs, that goes to 40,000. You'll see miners having to switch off because it just becomes unviable and you're at a risk. Then if you're going through four or five months paying more for your energy and still having to pay staff and still have to pay some of those overhead costs, that's a challenge.
01:08:12.374 - 01:09:11.062, Speaker C: At least if your energy cost is lower than the bitcoin price, you have a contribution to cover some of those overhead costs. And then you're effectively giving yourself a little bit of breathing space in the hope that the bitcoin price goes up and those miners that are prepared for the halving once that hash rate drops, the difficulty, like we saw when China switched off, I think it was like 40 50% of the hash rate overnight. Back in May, June of 2021, we saw all the miners benefit because those miners that were switched on were able to get more rewards then because the difficulty had reduced. So better prepared miners will be better prepared. Going through the halving, the less prepared miners who have higher hash rate and lower efficiency, it's going to be a challenge. So what you really want to see is you want low cost miners with great efficiency. They're the ones that are going to win the day and they'll benefit, and they'll benefit.
01:09:11.062 - 01:09:19.440, Speaker C: The way that bitcoin is actually set up, it sends a real benefit out to those miners that are in that space.
01:09:20.610 - 01:10:09.902, Speaker A: Yeah, it was a great thought to end on, but I'm not going to close the show quite yet because I do have one more thing I want to bring up. Dilution was also a play here, and I know we spoke about it a little bit on this show, and we've spoken off air about it quite a bit. But marathon has put out an atm, I believe an ATM to the market for $750,000,000 raise. Cipher mining, I do not believe has done anything like that because they still have their ipo money. But we have seen some selling of some of their shares from Bitfury, which has not much, but there's some of that in there. And then there's been a few other miners like Cleanspark that have also started diluting a little bit. So I think there's some other aspects of this bitcoin mining stock price action that should be taken into account.
01:10:09.902 - 01:10:40.010, Speaker A: And you noted that. And then the last thing I'll say is, like the ETF play we had Reggie Smith from JP Morgan on the show. We kind of talked about what's going to happen. What are expectations for investors and for public liquid funds are interested in purchasing these stocks and they have exposure to other vehicles perhaps in the next three months. So why go load up on a lot of bitcoin mining stocks if you have the opportunity to go purchase an ETF which has, quote unquote, direct exposure to underlying asset, which is what they really want? It is a conundrum.
01:10:40.750 - 01:11:43.680, Speaker C: The expectation out there is that obviously bt price will rise if the big investment firms have to go out and sort of like purchase bitcoin to keep on their balance sheet if they're going to offer these services. That's positive, because we know for the last two years, 70% of all bitcoin hasn't even left an exchange or a wallet. It stayed where I haven't sold any in two years. I'm keeping hold of my small amount of bitcoin, and 70% of people actually own bitcoin are in the same boat as well. The issue for mining stocks is will the ETF, like you say, move funds away from miners into other areas that are maybe more correlated with bitcoin, bitcoin itself? So that's the sort of $64 question. I don't have the answer to that one. We'll just have to wait and see.
01:11:43.680 - 01:12:10.194, Speaker C: But we know that investors like the mining stocks, they like the volatility. You can see gains. Bitcoin price can go up one or 2% in a day. Mining stocks can go up 2030, 40% in a day. I've seen mining stocks go up 50% in a day. I've also seen mining stocks drop nearly fifty cents in a day as well. So that policy, but that appeals to a certain type of investor.
01:12:10.194 - 01:12:47.280, Speaker C: They want that sort of risk and reward set up. So who knows? We're just talking through the sort of the metrics of it, like. But actually it might bring people into the mining stocks again. And we saw in 2021, there was an absolute avalanche of people trying to get in some of these stocks as we saw their market caps rise significantly massively higher than what they are now. I mean, most of these mining stocks, I would say, I'm going to say, are like 80% down on where they were in 2021. Still, and we've seen green shoots already this year. Some have got a long way to go to get to where they need to be.
01:12:47.280 - 01:12:50.160, Speaker C: So I'll leave you with that final thought.
01:12:51.410 - 01:13:10.326, Speaker A: Not a great thought to end on, but a truthful one. Anthony, thank you again so much for joining the show.
