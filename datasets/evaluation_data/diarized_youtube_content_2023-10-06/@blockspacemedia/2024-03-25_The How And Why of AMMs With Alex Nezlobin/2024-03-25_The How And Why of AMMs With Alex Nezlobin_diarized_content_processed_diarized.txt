00:00:03.280 - 00:00:41.020, Speaker A: Hey, guys. I'm here today with Alex Nslovin. Alex Nslovin is somebody that I found on Twitter who, in my opinion, is one of the most intelligent people when it comes to markets, traditional financial markets. And he's now jumped into crypto, and I think he's got a really interesting perspective. So, Alex, if you want to introduce yourself, and then also, like I said prior, I'm not usually inclined to ask somebody about their background, and I find it typically kind of boring. But I think with you, the context of this conversation, it's going to be. It's going to be really interesting.
00:00:41.020 - 00:00:46.996, Speaker A: So if you could tell us, like, you know, a little bit about your background and then what. What brought you into crypto?
00:00:47.180 - 00:01:08.744, Speaker B: All right, thank you. Guard. It's a pleasure to be here. I am a longtime fan of your work. Followed you a while ago. I think you had less than one k followers at the time and have been following the unaligned avant garde events ever since. So it's really a pleasure to be here.
00:01:08.744 - 00:01:56.614, Speaker B: In terms of my background, I used to be an accounting professor. I worked at a couple of business schools in the US. So New York university first, and then UC Berkeley. And after that, I moved to London and worked at the London School of Economics for a while. And at some point, I started developing interest in market microstructure issues. And when you are in academia, you try to find something that interests you, but at the same time, that looks sufficiently mysterious so that not enough people have done work in that area, and you can be one of the first ones to start there. Started looking at them different issues in Defi, there were people already in academia working on those issues.
00:01:56.614 - 00:02:17.634, Speaker B: So I cannot say that I was really a trailblazer, but I found some of these issues interesting and underexplored, and so I started looking at them in more detail. And at some point, I just decided that it's probably time to quit academia and just start doing that full time. So that's my story.
00:02:17.934 - 00:02:24.438, Speaker A: Uh, okay. You're sort of an expert on amms, or I think, personally you become some of an expert on amms.
00:02:24.486 - 00:02:24.646, Speaker B: But.
00:02:24.670 - 00:03:18.258, Speaker A: But first, I want to ask you, uh, sort of a broad, overarching question, and you can run this. This may be a little bit hard to answer, and this is, uh, I just. You can run whatever direction you want with this, but I want to ask you what, in just leaving out crypto for a second, what problems in the traditional financial system do you think are? Maybe if you want, you can, like, order them, maybe like, or just go whatever direction you want with this. But what do you see in the traditional financial system as like barriers to entry or issues that are clearly, you know, due to entrenched actors or incumbents or whatever? Like, do you see issues in traditional markets where you're like, this is a problem, and once again, you don't have to say, you don't have to respond with something that crypto solves? Right now we're going to get into that. But just like, where do you see problems in traditional finance?
00:03:18.426 - 00:03:59.462, Speaker B: Right? So I think it's a great question. I think there are markets in traditional finance that are super efficient and there are markets that are nearly not as efficient as one would like them to be. There is a sort of a big discrepancy in terms of these markets, right? So some of them are really great, some are not doing so great. My personal opinion is that if you look at, say, payments, I don't think that that market is extremely efficient at the moment. You do spend a lot of time on intermediaries. Not time, but rather money. You spend a lot of money on intermediaries.
00:03:59.462 - 00:04:46.524, Speaker B: When you make a very simple transaction at your grocery store, you pay x, the grocery store gets y, and there is a significant difference between the two, even though the transaction is pretty straightforward, even if you pay with your debit card. So that's basically just a transfer of cash, but it costs a lot of money by the standards of some other markets. So you can lose a significant amount of money probably with a credit card it's going to be two 3%. With a debit card you can get it under 1%. You can try if you're a tailor, but you will have to work hard for that. But you will still, even if you try hard, you will probably not be able to go under 30 basis points or so. That is clearly an efficient market, in my view.
00:04:46.524 - 00:05:26.224, Speaker B: And then there are international payments, which is yet another pretty inefficient market. And of course, everything is regulated and payment systems are regulated and all that, so we're paying a cost of that. But those are the markets that I think are pretty inefficient. Then there are markets that are efficient. I think the stock market is a very efficient one, even for retail traders. So I think that one is going to be pretty difficult to compete with. But at the same time, even efficient markets are sometimes, sometimes have their own problems.
00:05:26.224 - 00:06:12.600, Speaker B: So it's difficult for firms, for example, to access them. It's great when you already listed on an exchange, it's cheap for everyone. To trade your shares, but to get listed on an exchange is a pretty complicated process. In particular, if you want to get listed in the US, there are significant compliance costs and so on and so forth. And one could say that maybe the markets are efficient because there are these compliance costs, but who knows? So I think that there are some opportunities for decentralized systems for crypto to compete in some of these areas. But one has to be mindful of the fact that it's going to be pretty difficult in many markets.
00:06:12.792 - 00:06:50.690, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, so that's, we're going to leave out the payments stuff because I don't think anybody cares about payments. I care a lot about payments, but I don't think anybody really cares about payments. If I recall, you sort of, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think one of your interests, when you were hopping into crypto was you started looking at amms, is that correct? And you, this is a conversation we've had just between us two. And you said, look, like I started digging into amms and I saw, like, there's extreme inefficiencies here. What, like, so what kind of piqued your interest about amms? And. Yeah, like, what, what was it about amms that you sort of became attracted to?
00:06:50.842 - 00:07:52.504, Speaker B: So I think a really attractive feature of mms is that you can just spin up your own market, provide liquidity for your token, and everyone can trade against it. And imms provide liquidity, the sort of original version of imMs, if we go back in time a little bit, have this feature where liquidity is provided everywhere. So essentially, no matter whether the price goes up, the price goes down, but you will have liquidity that is always on in all ranges. There is, of course, a question that if the price is in some weird place, then people might start withdrawing their liquidity. And so you still have the issue that liquidity might very well fluctuate. But the idea that you can start your own market for some assets, for digital assets, and people will be able to trade in this market relatively cheaply, I think that that's something that is very interesting.
00:07:52.804 - 00:08:31.310, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, just this idea of permissionless capital formation, which I think this is what people like to refer to, sort of like the unlock of Amms, is this the ability just permissionlessly spin up a market for any asset? Okay, what is. So, I don't know if you finished your answer, sorry. But like I said, what is the long run for you with Amms? What do you see? Let's say that the rails of finance run atop crypto, maybe this is not. So let's just say 15 years from now, crypto has grown. What are we trading on Amms?
00:08:31.502 - 00:09:09.682, Speaker B: That's a great question. We will have to see. So I think that there are very different markets that are operating on Amms right now, and each market is going to be different. So there may be more or less demand in this market depending on what else is happening in the bigger infrastructure. So the way I see major markets right now is that you're going to have big pairs like ETH, USDC, that traditional sort of tokens traded there. They're traded on many different places. The advantage of mms and that pair is, or so far has been that you have pretty deep liquidity at reasonable prices.
00:09:09.682 - 00:09:42.794, Speaker B: So it's not necessarily the liquidity that is always best priced and you have tighter spreads elsewhere. But you have usually a pretty deep market in this bears at least on some chains. On major chains you would have a sufficiently deep market. Then there is another interesting market, which is stablecoins. And for stablecoins, people have even talked about using those markets sort of as a, as one of the fundamental building blocks for future payment systems. And you said that payments are not.
00:09:42.834 - 00:10:04.816, Speaker A: Interesting, but somehow I think they're like, I mean, this international payments. Yeah, yeah, it's like, it's, this is like my. Cause, you know, this is like, this is my crusade. But, but I think like I'm. Yeah, personally, I think that most people like, want to hear about, I don't know, more interesting step, but. Sorry, go ahead.
00:10:04.880 - 00:10:32.908, Speaker B: Yeah, but we will see what happens there. Right. But there is an issue with international payments. You want to pay somebody in euros and then you have USD and so you could trade two stable coins and then you can make the payment on chain or in one way or another. So I think that we are talking about a pretty remote future right now for stable coins. It's actually USD. Stable coins mostly traded against each other.
00:10:32.908 - 00:10:53.572, Speaker B: And those stable coins used to have good liquidity, but not as much if not so much if you look right now. So right now the situation is a little bit different because there are a lot of other ways that you can use your stable coins. And so basically people are, the liquidity there is drying up, but maybe it will come back. So then there are stable coins.
00:10:53.628 - 00:10:53.820, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:53.852 - 00:11:41.670, Speaker B: And then the third market is, of course, long tail assets where if somebody is launching a token, you can launch your own market pretty quickly. And so I think that this is the market where the access issue is the most significant one. Because to get listing on exchanges, you would have to do many things and there is some promise there. So different companies, different organizations launch tokens all the time. And launching a token, if you want to do this with market makers, that's going to cost you a lot of money. If you're going to launch it with amms so far, it will also cost you a lot of money. So it's going to be pretty expensive one way or the other to launch a token, but you have a more permissionless way to launch it.
00:11:41.670 - 00:12:02.184, Speaker B: And this is where technology might help in the future to minimize the cost of launching the token, to minimize the cost that right now you would have to pay to market makers. And that's a pretty significant amount most of the time. So I think that market is certainly promising.
00:12:03.204 - 00:13:04.780, Speaker A: Is this. Yeah, so like, let's, we'll zoom in on the last one. So like maybe this is the creation of a startup or something. I mean, we see right now with governance tokens, we see it right now with, yeah, like apps, defi apps, like so on and so forth that have these governance tokens that are sometimes, you know, they're traded in these liquidity pools. Um, do you find the value of a blockchain system? I'm like really kind of getting a high level here of a blockchain system is diminished at all with the, I don't want to say property rights, I'm not sure that's the exact word, but where do you view the value of assets being launched? But a lot of the value of those assets is derived from governance or fees. I mean, is this something that we can disintermediate in the sense of like, right now we have Silicon Valley startups, right, and they'll go to these, these VC's and they'll raise sea stage capital. These are all private rounds.
00:13:04.780 - 00:13:44.176, Speaker A: This is all behind closed doors. A lot of crypto does this as well now. But like, let's say in the future, is this something that amms really disintermediate? And also now I'm pulling in your traditional financial knowledge, what are the barriers, regulatory compliance and maybe, maybe legitimate reasons that you can't just launch a token for something and say you're going to do something, then not do it? Or do you see what I'm saying here? Yeah, go ahead. I kind of wasn't the most eloquent way to ask that question, but I think you'll have an eloquent answer now.
00:13:44.200 - 00:14:03.836, Speaker B: You're setting the expectation way too high for me. I'm as degenerate as the next guy in all of this. So my personal preference is to usually think about small questions. So if there is a big one, I try to kind of break it down into smaller ones and then we can work on the smaller ones.
00:14:03.980 - 00:14:05.316, Speaker A: Yeah, I ramble.
00:14:05.500 - 00:15:44.510, Speaker B: So I think the two great questions that you're asking here is, first of all, should people be even launching tokens? What are sort of the legitimate reasons for a token to exist? What is their legitimate reason for a token token to be launched and what are sort of the related compliance issues? And how can we make sure that tokens are launched when it's really beneficial for people who are going to buy into it? And then there is a second part to it, which is, let's say that there are legitimate tokens and they need to be launched. We decided that part already. What is the best way to launch those tokens? So I feel that those questions are related in a way, but at the same time I don't feel that they're also kind of mutually exclusive. So for me, the simple question, well, a difficult one still, but I think that one where something that we can really start working on almost right away is to think about the best way to launch a token. Assuming that it's a legitimate token, it needs to be launched. We decided that already there is a nice compliant organization that is launching it and they did all the proper due diligence and we're sure that they're not going to rug it. So with all of that in place, how do we launch a token? And that is a question for, that is a question where people who are designing the markets, they can kind of make meaningful progress, I think.
00:15:44.510 - 00:16:07.578, Speaker B: And this is where I hope to see some progress, because right now the options are you go to a market maker, you will pay a lot of money there, or you can try to do this on an amm. But amms are not really, they're designed to provide liquidity. But with the current designs, I think there are issues that basically end up costing you money as well, even if you launch on an amm.
00:16:07.746 - 00:16:08.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:08.834 - 00:17:09.324, Speaker B: The second question though, the big one is, should we be doing this? What are the legitimate uses for tokens? I think that that's a great question to ask, but it has so many angles to it that are not necessarily even always economics based. But we do see people, we do see the demand for it and we see sort of the promise from regulators. They have to be value neutral, I think they call it. I forgot what the term is. Right. But in their decisions, for example, what is a security and what is not a security? They shouldn't be making these pronouncements based on how they feel about a particular investment opportunity. Is it going to be good or is it going to be bad? Now, I'm really outside of my comfort zone, so some people with legal education, with legal background should talk about it.
00:17:09.324 - 00:17:16.913, Speaker B: So, you see, I managed to match the eloquence of the question with my answer.
00:17:17.023 - 00:17:29.133, Speaker A: So, no, I think. I think you're right. Like, uh, you could. You could almost be interviewing yourself right here, because you synthesized the two questions and then sort of gave nebulous answers to them. It's very. It's very academic of you. Um, okay.
00:17:29.133 - 00:17:53.014, Speaker A: But so, well, I guess there's. We could go two directions with this. What? Right now, if you want to give, like, I think some people know this, but if you want to give, like, a brief kind of history of amms, like, I don't know, maybe we could start with Univ one or something like this to where we are now and where you see the ability to make real improvements. Maybe we can just start with that, and we'll go back to digging into the more philosophical ideals later.
00:17:54.074 - 00:18:37.416, Speaker B: Yes. So, I am new to the field, relatively new to the field. I completely missed Uniview one. So the time when I started looking at these questions, that was around the time uniview two came out. And that is something that first interested me in all of this. Now, when you read about Univ two, people usually talk a lot about invariants and xy equals k, all that stuff. I personally don't find this to be the most enlightening way to talk about these issues, because it's kind of difficult to understand what exactly is going on if you start talking about invariants and all that.
00:18:37.416 - 00:19:26.352, Speaker B: So the way I like to think about this is that, imagine that you have an audiobook, because other books we all understand, right? So you have some. Some people are buying, some people are selling, and they put their orders, and then you trade against that order book if you are a taker of liquidity. So, with Univ two, the basic idea is that you put liquidity roughly uniformly, and I don't want to say uniformly, because sort of the. It's not in the price space, but the square root of price. But this is sort of mechanics that I kind of don't want to get into. But the idea is that when a user buys from you, then so they buy ETH, you get USDC, for example. You immediately put the amount of USDC that you had for sale on the other side of the book.
00:19:26.352 - 00:20:09.954, Speaker B: So basically an order gets filled here, you create an order on the other side right away, and this is done automatically for you. So if you provide liquidity, you just have to provide liquidity in the two tokens. And then the algorithm will make sure that once some order is filled on one side, an equivalent order is created on the other side. So this is a very, very convenient way to do it. You don't need to worry about gas, you need to, don't need to worry about your positions and all that. With V three, the big innovation was that it had a concentrated liquidity positions where you could say that I want to provide liquidity, but only in a certain range. That's sort of the short history of mms.
00:20:09.954 - 00:20:53.706, Speaker B: And with respect to issues, I think that what people started to look at and started to realize, and this is why I like Defi, this is why I love the fact that I switched to defi BS, you know, something from traditional finance. But then here you have to really test your knowledge. So you know that, for example, latency matters and it costs money if you have high latency. So then you need to be able to really understand why it matters and why it's going to cost you money. Yes, it's going to be costing you money probably in the world of Defi as well, but you need to see how. So the idea is that you have some liquidity sitting on the book, and since it's passive, it just sits there. And then there are people who are better informed.
00:20:53.706 - 00:21:38.470, Speaker B: They know that the price has moved, so they just keep picking off your liquidity all the time. So they trade against you only when it's profitable for them. That's sort of a well known problem with toxic order flows. And the way it's done in traditional markets is that I put an order. I know that there is a risk that somebody is going to pick me off, but I will be doing my best to remove the order before they can do it. And so I understand that still I will probably be losing to the high frequency shops all the time because they invest in latency. And I may be investing, I may be making money elsewhere, I may be making money by really providing liquidity for uninformed flow.
00:21:38.470 - 00:22:14.036, Speaker B: So I will be losing to them every once in a while. But hopefully I will not be losing too much to them. And hopefully people will still take my liquidity for other reasons, for reasons other than arbitrage. And so on average, I will be making money that way. The key idea in all of this is that latency really matters a lot. So even if you can reduce the latency a little bit, you're already saving money. And of course, on blockchain, at least on the big ones, we have some pretty high latency.
00:22:14.036 - 00:22:34.054, Speaker B: So on ethereum, you have twelve second block times, which is huge. On l two s. Is 2 seconds a good latency or not? That's good by blockchain standards, but for trading, it's still a very significant amount of time, even if you go to 400 milliseconds.
00:22:34.634 - 00:22:52.610, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. I think that's a really good sort of overview. So what is uni v four and then uniswap x trying to do? What is the next step in this sort of trajectory for amms? But, yeah, maybe like specifically here, Uniswap, but what is the next innovation?
00:22:52.802 - 00:23:25.684, Speaker B: So we will have to see what happens on Univ. Four, because with Univ. Four, the idea is pretty straightforward, rather than having this fixed pools. So, for example, for this USDC pair, you can have four pools. On Univ. Three, you can have a pool with a fixed fee of one basis, point 530 and 1%. Instead of having those fixed fee tiers, you can create more customizable pools.
00:23:25.684 - 00:24:15.704, Speaker B: First of all, that means that the fee can be something else rather than these four values. Or maybe it can be dynamic based on the order flow, or maybe you can actually change something else. So, for example, maybe you can lock the pool altogether and say that nobody can trade against it unless they win an off chain auction. So Uniview four is sort of an extensible platform, and it remains to see what people build on top of it. I personally hope that some of the things that people build will still be open to everybody in the sense that you can still have liquidity that is always on. You just trade as usual. You submit your trade and it goes through, rather than you have to go right away through some off chain thing, and only then the trade can land.
00:24:15.704 - 00:25:12.418, Speaker B: But it remains to be seen how the competition plays out in all of this. Yes, one thing that is important to keep in mind is that Univ. Three does have a significant uninformed volume. So there is a huge arbitrage volume, but there is also a lot of uninformed volume. And so there is something to build on Univ two pools, like the Ethus DC pool, is actually making money still. And so I think that there is hope in all of this for open systems with Uniswap X, that's a different story, because there, the idea is that instead of letting people trade right away against the pool, they're showing their order to fillers and then the fillers can fill it. So it's an RFQ system that is built on top of the Univ.
00:25:12.418 - 00:25:14.696, Speaker B: Three system. Okay.
00:25:14.720 - 00:25:27.336, Speaker A: Can you. Yeah, can you like, just quickly explain an RFQ system? And I don't know if you want to talk about, like, solvers and like, who these people are realistically, but, yeah, like, can you just sort of break that down in?
00:25:27.480 - 00:25:54.210, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a fascinating area. So I looked at some data. There is a lot to discuss there. And so some of these things still puzzle me. But basically the idea is that you, there is an order. Somebody wants to trade something, you show the order to fillers, and then they decide if they want to fill it out of their pocket or they want to route it to a couple of dexes. To a few dexes, or they just send it to the pool.
00:25:54.210 - 00:26:24.004, Speaker B: So there is a number of options that they have. They do have to build, they do have to beat the price that uniswap can get on its own, sort of. The basic router can get on its own. So you have to be better than that. And then you get the order and then you get to fill it. There is also some sort of fallback mechanisms that once, if you win the order, you have to deliver on it. And if you don't deliver on it, then it's broadcast to the public.
00:26:24.004 - 00:27:12.260, Speaker B: And then after that there is some dutch auction that plays out and people can post fiddlers other than you or other parties can start posting this order on chain. I don't think that that part is particularly important, because I think that what happens most of the time is that either the order gets picked by fillers and they deliver on it most of the time, or maybe they just don't feel it, in which case the router fills it. What's interesting about all of this is that I'm not sure in Defi, people are super excited about all kinds of RFQ systems. You see them everywhere. Everyone wants to do an RFQ. And there were, of course, there is cowswap. There are other systems as well.
00:27:12.260 - 00:27:52.336, Speaker B: Cowswap was one of the most successful ones. I think there are issues with this approach, generally speaking, and I think it also remains to be seen how successful this is. It's still an improvement. So don't get me wrong, I think that it's still probably a good idea for users to do it. But there are also some issues and decisions that one has to make in implementing such a system. So, for example, you are broadcasting the order to all the fillers, and then the fillers know that if they win the order, then some other guys decided to bid less than you. So they have a little bit of a winner scores.
00:27:52.336 - 00:28:36.054, Speaker B: But it's not just the winner scores. In traditional markets, when you win an order, there is also an issue that now everyone has seen it, and so people can trade ahead of you. And so if you make it completely permissionless, if you have just an endpoint where everyone can listen to this, then everyone can see that a huge order is coming in. If I don't win it, well, maybe I should just trade ahead of it, because if you win it now, you have to. So there is an obvious issue with that. Some people try to guard their systems a little bit, and Uniswap X has some permissioning systems, so they don't let just anyone in. But my understanding is that it's, it's pretty easy to get in if you really want to.
00:28:36.054 - 00:28:39.014, Speaker B: The requirements do not appear to be super high.
00:28:39.514 - 00:29:17.104, Speaker A: So just explain to me, over the long run, is there an equilibrium where the LP's in the pool make money? And also fillers, solvers, whatever, these RFQ agents also make money. Is there like a positive sum game to be played here? Or is the long term equilibrium that if these RFQ systems are not filling these orders, they're almost always having these LP's lose? Like, yeah, what does that make sense?
00:29:17.264 - 00:29:20.004, Speaker B: What is the equilibrium traditional finance on this?
00:29:20.504 - 00:29:30.212, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, it's like there's a small number of like, you know, market makers that ultimately fill all orders, essentially. Right.
00:29:30.308 - 00:30:33.184, Speaker B: My feeling is that, so, first of all, my understanding of the situation in traditional markets right now is that you look at market makers that provide liquidity to brokers such as Robinhood, let's say. Right? So they make money, they provide great execution, they make money and they settle a lot of volume internally, not letting that volume hit the exchange. Now, if you look at their average market maker on an exchange, and this is a critical observation now, because this is what people complain a lot in Defi, that LP's are losing money. But look at the average market maker on an exchange. Liquidity maker, I should say, I will not say market maker, liquidity maker. So, liquidity provider on an exchange, are they making money? They are also, on average, in a loss. So they're making losses, people who make liquidity on exchanges.
00:30:33.184 - 00:32:05.194, Speaker B: And then there is a question. Why is that the case? Because according to some data, they even in a loss after you account for all of the liquidity rebates that they get, but on average, they're still making losing money that way. So the reason why people think that is happening is that not everybody who makes liquidity on exchanges, who provides liquidity to exchange, has the interest of making money by trading back and forth. Some people trade directionally that way. Big hedge funds who want to change their position, who want to buy some stock in a large amount, they will normally try to do this not by taking liquidity quickly, but instead by providing liquidity to the market. And then they may lose on that operation a little bit, but they believe that they have some longer term alpha, so they sort of lose in the nearby term, a few markouts with a relatively short period, and then they still make money with some of the special alpha that they have. So I think that what markets, what defi markets need to learn is to provide better options for people who want to trade as liquidity makers, as liquidity providers, for them to trade by providing liquidity to the pool.
00:32:05.194 - 00:32:44.472, Speaker B: Right now, it's not super convenient because you provide liquidity, it's going to be flipping back and forth. So it's difficult to get directional execution for you this way. But then if you provide a convenient way for people to get directional execution that way, I want to trade in size, I trade by providing liquidity. It's fine for me to be in a loss as long as I get my directional execution. I get directional execution, and I'm happy. Some uninformed people get their execution and they're happy, and everyone is still making money, because, again, I'm sort of funding this a little bit, but I wanted to trade directionally, and I wanted to trade in size, and so I decided to provide liquidity to the exchange.
00:32:44.528 - 00:33:39.896, Speaker A: Interesting. So, okay, sorry, I'm going to interrupt you for a second just to ask a general sentiment question. Is this at all disheartening to you in terms of the original premise? Of. Well, I say original premise, maybe we were a bit ambitious with the original premise, but does this to you, say anything about retail being able to be market makers? I think you probably, I would guess that you came into Defi and said, okay, this is not going to work over the long run. Retail can't just stick two coins together and be profitable over a large sample size. But to what degree is this kind of, I don't know, like, unfortunate for the vision and also maybe. Yeah, like, and we can eventually pivot into this.
00:33:39.896 - 00:33:45.044, Speaker A: We got a lot of things to talk about, but like, to what degree. Is this sort of a centralizing force as well?
00:33:45.544 - 00:34:24.926, Speaker B: Yes. So I think that if the idea is that retail should be able to make money, that sounds naive. That sounds a bit naive to me. So even though, again, I think that I'm less in the naive camp now that I have seen that really, there are pools where you don't make a lot of money by doing that, but you can make, or at least in many periods, you could make some meaningful money. For example, again, in the univ. Two pool. So there is uninformed flow there.
00:34:24.926 - 00:34:51.472, Speaker B: In the Ethus DC Univ. Two pool, 30 bps, there is not a lot of volume there. It's a small pool. Liquidity is drying up, but surprisingly, with the traditional definition of markouts. So we see what happened and then we see what the price is. Maybe five minutes later on binance, people were making profits there. It's a question whether there's the best way, the best use of their money.
00:34:51.472 - 00:35:58.448, Speaker B: Maybe they could have done something else with it. Maybe they should have staked their ETH, should have done something else and made more money. But at least it doesn't look completely hopeless. One other thing that I want to mention, why it doesn't look completely hopeless right now, is that even after you look at all of those RFQ systems, and you look at what some people call their exhaust, so basically, what comes after their FQ system, what lands on chain after they are done, is that profitable or not for LP's? And if you look at the average profitability of that, it's pretty high still. So after everything is said and done in those RFQ systems, they still land on chain. And I looked at the recent data now, and the recent data is still consistent with what I've seen in the past, still lands on chain at close to five bps markout. So basically, for one reason or another, there are these profitable orders that people are not willing to fill in the RFQ systems, and they just send it on chain.
00:35:58.448 - 00:36:35.926, Speaker B: And those orders are still profitable for LP's. And it looks like they should have taken those orders ahead of their LP's, right, because it's profitable. But maybe they don't want to do this for one reason or another. Maybe because of the winners curse that we discussed before, or some inventory risks or something else. We don't know exactly what it is. But with all those RFQ systems in place, you look at almost any single one of them and all of those systems, they still end up with positive flow, still coming to LP's after that. So I think it's an interesting question whether you can be making money.
00:36:35.926 - 00:37:07.324, Speaker B: I don't think that you will be able to make significant amounts of money by passively LP ing. That's probably not the case. Other smarter strategies? Hard to tell, but one cannot deny that there is a lot of uninformed flow still on those exchanges. In the long term, I think that we should switch more and more to directional. To people who want to trade directionally as the main source of liquidity provision.
00:37:08.224 - 00:37:37.454, Speaker A: Yeah. Something for it mimics traditional markets. Okay, so, like, sort of related. Can you explain, in layman's terms, with your background in both traditional finance and crypto, can you explain the difference? Because I think that this is another thing that I want to say people get wrong, but it's sort of, like, phrased in a way that I don't think is precisely what's going on. People talk about how Robinhood, right, receives that. They sell the order flow. Right? Like the citadel.
00:37:37.454 - 00:37:50.902, Speaker A: Okay, can you explain why this is different and maybe, like, for regular regulatory reasons or whatever, but why this may be different than, like, front running retail?
00:37:51.038 - 00:37:51.286, Speaker B: Right?
00:37:51.310 - 00:38:02.020, Speaker A: Like, it's not precisely the same. So, like, what do you think of this analogy? And, like, can you sort of explain what. What's going on there and then maybe some sort of comparison with what we see in defi markets?
00:38:02.142 - 00:38:48.488, Speaker B: Yes. So, first, I think that one needs to get one thing straight right away, is that whatever is happening at Robinhood is actually very. Ends up. You basically end up with a very good outcome for traders there. You can take this data from people who don't like payment from order flow. So don't go to Citadel and ask them what they think, but the SSE, right now, they don't seem too keen on this arrangement, but you go to them and you ask them, so how much exactly does it cost to trade on robinhood? And by cost, I mean not just cost about some benchmark that we come up with. That doesn't really make sense.
00:38:48.488 - 00:39:45.110, Speaker B: But you trade today, you see what the price is later, the mid price on lead exchanges, very liquid. You see what the price is a little time away, and then you ask yourself, how much do you regret trading at the price that you traded? So what was sort of the difference between the price that you paid a little while ago and the mid price on exchanges right now? And we talked about. For reference, we talked about this payment systems and all that, where you pay 1%, where you pay 2%. So maybe. So what should that cost be? You ask somebody who doesn't trade that often, but is very well versed in finance markets in general. You ask them, what should it be? What is the cost of trading on a platform like Robinhood? They might say, well, maybe 25 basis points, a quarter over percent, maybe ten basis points. We don't know.
00:39:45.110 - 00:40:17.948, Speaker B: What does the data say? If you look at what detractors say about this, then the actual estimate is you take one basis point and then maybe you take four tenths of it. Right? So it's 0.4 of a basis point. This is how much you end up paying in liquid stocks. So this is really good for most people. So if you are a retail trader, do you really care whether you pay 0.4 of a basis point or maybe 0.7
00:40:17.948 - 00:40:41.762, Speaker B: of a basis point? It's a pretty good execution. So out of that 0.4 basis point, this is what you pay to Citadel. Sort of end up paying to Citadel, end up overpaying to Citadel. How much of that is going to be payment for order flow? Well, maybe 0.2, so maybe half of that. And that goes from Citadel back to the broker.
00:40:41.762 - 00:40:57.044, Speaker B: And then the broker will use that hopefully to provide some additional services to you. They will not necessarily give it back to you as a part of your trade, but maybe they will provide free options trading on the side or something like that. So they might additional thing with that money.
00:40:57.164 - 00:40:58.580, Speaker A: So that's what retail needs.
00:40:58.732 - 00:41:57.286, Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes. Zero day to expiration, right? So basically they will get you hooked on even more services with that. So I think that this is a super efficient system, but the reason it is super efficient is that if you now take Citadel's perspective, why are they doing this? They don't necessarily look to make money on each individual ward's order. So they feel like I might lose, I might gain, I might make a little tiny amount. But what's important for them is that they don't expose themselves too much in case when there is a significant move in the market, their systems have not picked it up yet, but somebody smart is trading against them already on the lead exchange. That will happen right away. Something moves in Chicago, they will have to make sure that they get best information in New York right away because they need to.
00:41:57.286 - 00:42:16.814, Speaker B: Whatever the orders they have there, they need to cancel them. They need to move them. Right with robinhood. They just need to make sure. First of all, the orders are small. The bigger is the order, the worse is going to be the execution. But nobody trades in huge sizes on product, so that's not an issue, the size of the order.
00:42:16.814 - 00:42:42.164, Speaker B: Secondly, most orders are taker orders, market orders. So people are actually willing to pay a little bit to get their order executed. They don't want to just sit and move, limit orders all the way, all the time on the app. They just want to get execution. And so those are the people who are already willing to pay a little bit. And for Citadel, it's fine to do it because they don't have the significant risk. They're just trading against some high frequency trader.
00:42:42.584 - 00:42:46.808, Speaker A: They know in aggregate that it's non toxic flow, effectively. Yes.
00:42:46.896 - 00:43:19.974, Speaker B: Yes. And so the other very important thing, why they can do it is because they have, there is a regulatory environment for all of that. So, for example, an order comes in and they see it's good for them. Can they take it right away? No, they cannot. They have to go to all the lead exchanges and they have to check what the prices are there. They cannot take it at the price that would be worse for the user than what is available somewhere else. They have the duty to provide best execution.
00:43:19.974 - 00:43:56.140, Speaker B: They definitely cannot front run the order. And how is it done? How can they not front run the order? Can they do this by mistake sometimes? Because they are market makers everywhere. They provide liquidity to all the markets. And then there is a guy trading, and then the guy might say, well, you're trading ahead of me on this market because you're providing, you know, you're frontrunning me by making a similar trade on somewhere, somewhere else. They really have to have a very sort of clear system for information. Also, they have to, they call it sometimes chinese walls. Right.
00:43:56.140 - 00:44:57.920, Speaker B: So the information separation. So basically, I don't trade on that information. I might front run you in the sense that it's not. It's not going to be front running. I might, you know, one of my trades might be competing with yours, but your trades were clearly isolated from what is happening elsewhere, and they don't really have reasons to break this because why would they violate the law if they're making sufficient amount of money elsewhere? So the issue with DeFi now, and I'm sorry, it's sort of like we're going all around and now, only now I'm answering your question, but the issue with DeFi is that there is really no duty to provide best execution. There is really no guarantee that you would not be front run. So essentially, when people talk about selling order flow without those guarantees, that just a situation where you're basically telling somebody that, hey, you know, I have complete freedom of what I want to do.
00:44:57.920 - 00:45:31.682, Speaker B: So that's very different. Because now you can abuse the uninformed trait in all of the different ways. So the uninformed trait can, of course, come in with some slippage tolerance that I want execution, not worse than this. So, in that case, you will provide execution. You might provide execution at the worst possible price. There is nothing that prevents you from doing that, and that's completely different from what is happening in traditional markets. And you can look at the execution quality again, and you can see that the results are orders of magnitude different.
00:45:31.778 - 00:45:45.962, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So now we're kind of moving into that direction. You said something one time that I thought was fascinating. I'm not trying to incriminate you here, but also, I feel like we got to get down to the bottom of things. You made. I don't know.
00:45:45.962 - 00:46:22.830, Speaker A: You write these threads sometimes. I don't know if this was a thread or just a random tweet, but you said something along the lines of, you thought, once again, I'm not trying to incriminate you. You thought there was a chance that some forms of mev, maybe sandwiches specifically, could be, maybe front running. Yes. And potentially insider trading, which I thought was a very fascinating terminology to use. I personally have seen how this works, and I've come to a similar conclusion. Obviously, the idea within crypto natives is, look, you broadcast something to a public mempool, and it's a completely permissionless system.
00:46:22.830 - 00:46:33.550, Speaker A: You can do whatever you want with that information. Right. Yeah. What is your kind of thoughts on this? Yeah, just wherever you want to go with that. I really thought that was, like, quite interesting.
00:46:33.662 - 00:47:27.794, Speaker B: Yes. Lawyers are still arguing about some of this stuff, and I certainly don't want to give too much ammunition to, I don't know, whoever might be looking into this question and misinterpreting what I have to say on this. But I think that the concern is very real in the sense that when we talk about insider trading. So, first of all, you need to decide which exactly laws and regulation apply in this case. And I will leave this to lawyers. I cannot really speak to that. But sort of what is the general flavor of those regulations that you cannot trade based on private information, and you cannot really extract profits from it? And so.
00:47:27.794 - 00:48:51.594, Speaker B: And then people think that it basically means that, you know, you're not supposed to front run, but even back running can be a tricky thing, because you're sort of trading right away after somebody. And so if that somebody submitted that trade as a private trade to you and you extracting surplus that way, I think that would be a highly questionable practice in even in traditional finance, for sure. But would that be insider trading or not? But one issue that I wanted to bring up also is that when the SEC and regulators look at those insider trading cases, they don't necessarily show that something evil has happened where people really traded based on inside information. Sometimes they show that you just didn't have sufficient guards in place and you're supposed to have them if you are a broker, if you are a market maker. So those are, of course, regulated entities, and we are not talking about regulated entities here. So it's important to understand all of that legal context. But yeah, if you want to avoid insider trading, it's not sufficient to just say, hey, you know, I'm trying not to do it.
00:48:51.594 - 00:49:47.420, Speaker B: Usually you have to have systems in place and processes in place. And where that gets complicated is that if you have integrated searcher builders, you trade, you get private order flow, and then your own orders are competing with those private orders, then many things can happen. You can simulate a bunch of blocks and see what is the best outcome for you. Well, when you do those simulations, you are extracting some information from the private order flow, and maybe you're structuring your transaction so that it generates more value. And then maybe you're submitting this new transaction that you designed that way to some other builders. And now with other builders, that transaction is competing with the transaction that they received also through their private channel, and you received through a private channel. So then the whole situation becomes pretty messy, and one has to be super careful about this.
00:49:47.420 - 00:50:09.018, Speaker B: I think that there are sort of. It's not all. I think that there are things that, you know, it's a spectrum. There are probably things that are more problematic. So sandwiching something that is a private transaction, I think that, you know, in my view, I would certainly not do that sandwich in a public transaction. I personally see issues with that. Even so, though some lawyers disagree.
00:50:09.018 - 00:50:09.762, Speaker B: But I think that.
00:50:09.818 - 00:50:31.576, Speaker A: Yeah, that's. I was going to ask about that specifically, like, especially as we. I don't know how much this relates to the, to these, like, you know, increasing numbers of RFQ systems, but like, I was thinking about that as well. Like, if you're acting on private order flow that is not broadcasted to a public mempool, would that make a difference? It sounds like you still wouldn't do it even if it's publicly broadcasted. That's interesting.
00:50:31.640 - 00:50:55.468, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. So with private, you have to be really careful because that could be inside information and whatnot. Right. So it depends on sort of, again, on many factors. And I'm not a lawyer, so somebody will have to talk about this. But, but with private transactions, I read an interesting paper written by the lawyers who spoke about it.
00:50:55.468 - 00:51:55.284, Speaker B: And so then there is a question. So they were kind of debating it back and forth. For me. One of the things that is relevant from my reading of the paper, how they describe the law and from my understanding of what is happening in the media industry in general, is that if you want to show that a trade was okay, you didn't manipulate markets, so to speak, then you should have intent to trade for the purpose other than manipulation, essentially. So if somebody says there's market manipulation, that tricky to prove, and then there are no good precedents. And I think that there is almost zero probability that somebody will go after those. But one of the things there is that did you have an intent to trade if you only intend to trade in a particular bundle comes from the fact that you manipulated the price from the transaction in the middle.
00:51:55.284 - 00:52:22.268, Speaker B: I think that's a pretty strong indication that, well, maybe you shouldn't be doing that because you essentially, you buy x units of one token, you sell x units of the same token at the end, you extract money purely from this transaction in the middle. And you're submitting this as an atomic bundle, right.
00:52:22.436 - 00:52:28.116, Speaker A: In a single. Like. Yeah, effectively like a single block. Right. Like so, yeah, sorry, go on.
00:52:28.180 - 00:53:44.214, Speaker B: And so basically it's pretty clear from this setup that your intent is just to manipulate the price at which the middle transaction is executed and extract value from it. The market manipulation laws that they were referring to in traditional markets, there are many defenses that people can use, and I think that this is one of the reasons why those particular charges that they kind of discuss that could be brought up in this situation, they don't really, nobody does that in traditional markets. Base, it's difficult for you. It would be difficult for prosecution or whatnot to show that the price went up because of your manipulation and then it went down because of you. And then your only goal was to exploit this price rather than trade organically. So that would be difficult to show in traditional markets. But if you look at this particular market where you're just submitting a bundle and it's clear it's your transaction a, then there is the victim transaction b, and then it's your transaction c again, and you're submitting the whole thing as a single bundle and you're basically telling nobody and basically telling everybody not to execute transaction eight or transaction C on its own, then I think in this particular setup.
00:53:44.214 - 00:53:53.150, Speaker B: It's much more convincing than you're actually trying to manipulate the market. But again, that's my personal view. I know nothing about this and nothing.
00:53:53.182 - 00:53:58.638, Speaker A: About, I like to follow this up by saying I know nothing about any of this.
00:53:58.726 - 00:53:59.038, Speaker B: Yes.
00:53:59.086 - 00:54:10.236, Speaker A: Yes. All right. So then, like, just, I won't press you too much more on this, but, like, let's just talk about. It's NBBO, right? Like, national best. What is it?
00:54:10.380 - 00:54:12.148, Speaker B: National sexy is an offer? Yeah.
00:54:12.236 - 00:54:36.706, Speaker A: Yes. Okay. Why, like, play. I don't know if this is devil's advocate, but I can't think of another word. Why would regulators not look at DeFi markets and say, hey, you have to provide users with the best price. Everybody else is doing it. Like, is there any reason to think that we would be immune to this apart from being a permissionless system where anybody can submit blocks? Okay.
00:54:36.706 - 00:54:51.934, Speaker A: But, like, in terms of acting in the United States, perhaps, or the, you know, like, within our financial system, is there any reason to think that they wouldn't look at what's occurring in Defi eventually and say, yeah, you can't do this anymore? Like, obviously you can't do this?
00:54:52.234 - 00:55:51.696, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. So I think that one needs to look at, this is one area where, so first of all, again, the NBBO regulation, it also does a lot of good in traditional markets there for a good reason, actually. People managed to achieve a lot there because there is a credible mechanism for citadel, for example, to commit to, not to front run, not to abuse the trader, because they have to abide by this law. And everybody knows that that's the law in defi markets right now. I would be hard pressed to even tell what NBBO is because you have to compete for that liquidity that you see posted somewhere, and you have to compete for it with arbitrageurs. You have to compete for it with everyone else.
00:55:51.696 - 00:57:04.544, Speaker B: So it's difficult to say what the best execution would be. So with all of that, I'm hoping that, of course, regulators will not just step in and do something terribly stupid because they don't account for that fact that liquidity is and priority is contested in defi in different ways relative to traditional finance. But one example, just to illustrate, when are you getting good execution? When are you getting bad execution? So imagine that you submitted a transaction to the EthUSDC pair and your transaction executed with zero slippage, so it ended up being first in block. Is it good news or bad news for you versus, you came in right after an arbitrager. So an arbitrager was ahead of, you got that liquidity, and then you trading right after the arbitrageur. Some people will say, well, obviously slippage is bad, but just in terms of execution quality, let's think about what happened. So you had this spread, right, plus, minus five basis points from the MM price.
00:57:04.544 - 00:57:42.192, Speaker B: And if you are first in block, then you know that on average, you don't know where the price is exactly. You know that on average you probably paid five basis points on top of the true price. You know that the price was somewhere inside because there was no arbitrage transaction willing to do it. And so then you probably paid five basis points more or less. But let's see what happens now if an arbitrager came ahead of you. So the arbitrage comes out on this side of the book. So they take a little bit of liquidity and then the price moves up, and so they move the price to the sex price, to the price on the centralized exchange.
00:57:42.192 - 00:58:26.824, Speaker B: And so if you go after them, then you are essentially trading now at the sex price. This is just how imms work. They move the best bet or the best task to the MM price. If you're trading in the same direction as them after them, you have almost a zero mark out. So you get execution just as good as you would get in traditional finance. You're probably not paying over the real price because execution should also, the cost should also always be measured against the real price. So just given that it's done very differently in DeFi, it's difficult to say what NBA is because you have to account for the fact that prices will probably move before your transaction lands.
00:58:26.824 - 00:58:41.654, Speaker B: But if you're trading in the same direction as the arbitrage transaction, the price will be worse for you than you would have gotten if you were first in block. But it's still going to be very good for you because you're essentially trading at the centralized exchange price.
00:58:42.474 - 00:58:43.614, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:58:44.154 - 00:59:48.938, Speaker B: You see some fancy stuff happening in traditional finance as well on this, because some exchanges are beginning to play this arguably, arguably beginning to play this NBBO thing. So there was a famous issue with de orders, I believe they're called between IeX and Citadel, where I said that liquidity makers can post orders, but then if we see that something is happening, then we will be moving those orders around. So, for example, we will be just fading a little bit if we see that there is a significant move. And for the take orders, they slow them down, they have a speed bump. And so basically what ends up happening is that they can be advertising a very good price, which can be at NBBO, and then Citadel might be forced to take it because of the NBBO regulation. Citadel takes it, but goes through speed bump. So they slow it down, but then their signal tells them that there is a market price move, and so they kind of rug liquidity from under the citadel's order.
00:59:48.938 - 00:59:50.254, Speaker B: They move it away.
00:59:51.154 - 00:59:54.306, Speaker A: So people in the exact same scams.
00:59:54.410 - 01:00:14.270, Speaker B: Yes, yes. So that is. That is sort of, you know, that's a controversial point. So there are people on both sides. But what I'm saying is that with this regulations, the NBBO stuff, there are some issues with that as well. So you need to be very careful about how markets are exactly structured. And I think in Defi, it needs to be something else.
01:00:14.270 - 01:00:22.864, Speaker B: So one has to sit down and really carefully think about what is advertised liquidity and how can this be implemented if some. If somebody is to implement something like that.
01:00:23.054 - 01:01:01.146, Speaker A: Yeah. What are your like? So you have been very vocal as well as. They're very vocal. Like, you have been somewhat of a thought leader I would consider on MeV. And now for a couple of years now, I've been reading your takes on MeV. What do you look at, you know, now kind of transitioning into, I don't know, protocol design or whatever, like, how do you think the MEV landscape on Ethereum looks? Are you encouraged with what's occurring? Are you not encouraged? Do you have thoughts on PBS and inclusion lists? And, I mean, what are you seeing?
01:01:01.290 - 01:01:47.624, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. So I think that sort of the. My big idea that I wanted to sell to the world is that people spend a lot of time on mechanism design, but they may. That may not be the best way to address some of these issues. With the conclusion list and everything else, we try to come up with some fancy mechanism to kind of solve some problem, but usually it comes with two or three other problems. And MeV is a difficult game to play and it has very natural centralizing forces.
01:01:47.624 - 01:02:35.354, Speaker B: So, for example, if you. Statistical arbitrage, what they call statarp in the MeV landscape. Right. But basically sex Dex arbitrage is a very big component of it, and you have to have very special skills and you have to have a lot of money to do it, and you have to be able to take some possibly legal risks. I'm not gonna again, go too much into this, but you have to be of a certain mindset to do this kind of stuff, and there are not so many shops doing it successfully. And so eventually, a long time ago I was trying to convince people that, look, this is going to be, this is going to be a major centralizing force in all of this.
01:02:35.654 - 01:02:36.434, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:38.304 - 01:03:39.230, Speaker B: All of these fancy solutions that maybe we should have RFQ systems, maybe we should have inclusion lists, maybe we should have something else. I don't think that necessarily they go very far. What would improve things significantly on both decentralization level, but with almost all of the issues would be just the better performance of the underlying system. And this is something that for some reason the powers that be are really not that willing to consider. But if you were to, this is one of my crusades here. So if you were to cut block times, right, make blocks a little bit faster, then many of these things would be improved right away, even inclusion lists. So, for example, right now the issue with inclusion list is that we think that there is this builder that has, that is building a lot of blocks and they decided not to take risks with inclusion lists, with all fact transactions, for example.
01:03:39.230 - 01:03:48.094, Speaker B: And it's perfectly fine with me. I'm actually a big supporter of the idea that people should be only doing what they want to do in a way include what they want to include.
01:03:48.174 - 01:03:49.394, Speaker A: Right? Like, yeah.
01:03:51.614 - 01:04:56.454, Speaker B: Very much opposed to the idea that is circulating right now on inclusion list where basically the idea is that we will force the next validator to include something. Because, you know, I think that somebody in Africa should not be forced to include the transaction to Boko Haram against their laws. If they, you know, if somebody from Austria put it on the inclusion list, if somebody from Austria wants to do it, they should probably put it in their block. And this is what we should be trying to accomplish, that people, if they want to include something, they should be putting this into their own blocks. But the issue then they say is that if you do that, then if you start putting transactions in your old block, then you might lose a little bit of the marginal review. You might have to fill the block a little bit faster and not wait for the few hundred milliseconds at the end and get a little bit less of that MeV. So much of that would be solved by making the transactions that want to be included pay more and making them outbid that marginal meV.
01:04:56.454 - 01:06:06.790, Speaker B: So essentially then you could modify the logic of your validator a little bit, saying that, okay, I am going to end the auction a little bit sooner, so I'm going to grab the block a little bit sooner if I see that I'm getting sufficient value from these transactions that I'm including to out beat the expected MLeV that I'm getting. How do you minimize that? Well, if you had really fast blocks then that MeV would not be concentrated at the end of this twelve second block. You wouldn't have this one big payout. The validators imagine that you had infinitely fast blocks, then there would be a lot of space where there is no movie at all and there is really nothing to outbid. Essentially then everyone who wanted to be included, they would have to pay just a little tiny extra to outbid any mev that is out there for some of those blocks. We know that opportunities for statistical arbitrage, they go down with shorter block times. We know that opportunities for rearranging transactions, sandwich attacks and all that, they go down with shorter block times.
01:06:06.790 - 01:06:39.976, Speaker B: So many of those things improve significantly with shorter block times. Faster chains, cheaper transactions even. But if you don't want to make transactions cheaper, I guess that's fine, but just like have faster blocks versus some of this mechanism design things, you know, I'm not, I'm not super optimistic on those. I think that people spend a lot of effort on designing those, but the impact doesn't often doesn't seem to justify the amount of effort that was put in, to be honest.
01:06:40.170 - 01:07:17.696, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think then about just the premise of pushing most activity to l two s then? Like, because I think this is, you know, this is something like, for example, I spoke with Max Resnick and he's like, look, we should still try to improve the l one. But I think Ethereum, at least from what I've seen, like specifically Ethereum here, has been fairly committed to pushing activity to l two s. There's still a lot of activity on the l one, obviously. I mean this is what you're working on. But I mean is this, is this a solution unto itself or do you see, you still see like millisecond block times on, on the l one as.
01:07:17.760 - 01:08:12.424, Speaker B: Like the, you know, I think that for me it's mostly, I like to see what the general theory of the whole thing should be and then we can figure out where to get it done. So sure, surely we can put, you know, we can push everything to l two. We can push everything to Solana. At some point people will just asking, start wondering why exactly you need an expensive l one if all activity is happening on all two s anyway, if everything is happening on faster change settlement layer. Well, I think people might be a little bit misleading themselves on some of these points. I think that the reason why l one is still very attractive and committing to l one is attractive as there is a lot of liquidity in there. There is just simply a lot of money in there.
01:08:12.424 - 01:08:55.560, Speaker B: But we see increasingly then when you start pushing things and you start saying, well, I'm not going to do anything for Defi to improve the situation with Defi, I'm not going to do, I don't care about that. We'll push this to l two. Eventually. There will be a situation where, if that strategy is successful, where there is a lot of value sitting somewhere in l two, and then there is a low value l one. This is just saying that, hey, everyone should commit to me because I'm so secure. But at some point people will say, well, the value is there, then do we really need to commit? Right now, it's because of all the liquidity on l one. But again, you look at some other chains, they seem to be pretty successful by providing high performance.
01:08:55.560 - 01:09:10.290, Speaker B: And I think that even if they were not successful, I would still hope that that would be the direction in which it goes. Low performance costs a lot of money in defi, in trading everywhere, maybe less with payments.
01:09:10.482 - 01:09:26.570, Speaker A: So, yeah, payments is the big unlock, but, okay, the other thing I wanted to ask you is, I think Titan went down recently. So Titan's a builder. Was it Titan before I asked this question? I think Titan builder went down.
01:09:26.682 - 01:09:29.534, Speaker B: I think Titan went down right after the update. Right?
01:09:29.884 - 01:10:01.568, Speaker A: Yeah. And so Beaver has been dominating blocks. They have like, landed, I don't know, 40, 50% of blocks recently. Do you look at this? Is this concerning to you? Or do you see competition being able to supplant these big builders? Or are we just moving more and more towards these, like, long tier, long tail builders being integrated or dominated by, you know, the three to whatever, big block builders?
01:10:01.736 - 01:10:24.566, Speaker B: Yes, yes. No, I think that this is, this is a great point. I think that builder is so I think that Beaver is producing more than 40% of blocks even without Titan going down. So I need to. Right, they're back up even when they're back up. Yes. So I think that I need to check that and I think that there would probably be significant ways for them to even improve their share.
01:10:24.566 - 01:11:18.544, Speaker B: I'm to not sure they really are interested in increasing their share even further because I think that that is already attracting attention. So maybe sort of in a situation like lido. Right. So at some point you just have to say that, well, something might be enough because you don't necessarily want to see all the pushback, but this is something that many people have been talking for a long time. That you need to. The huge advantage comes from, again, sexdex arbitrage, top of the block arbitrage. It generates a lot of mev and it gives a big advantage to the parties with skills that have economies of scale.
01:11:18.544 - 01:12:02.718, Speaker B: Capital incentive. Right. So basically, centralization is a very natural force, and you really have to address this sex dex problem if you want to have more decentralization at the builder level. It's problematic in many ways. I think that many of the protocols that are being designed right now, many of the theories and theoretical paper is being written, they often talk about the notion of incentive compatibility for builders. The notion of incentive compatibility changes dramatically when you produce 50% of blocks. Yes.
01:12:02.718 - 01:13:02.090, Speaker B: What is optimal for me to do when I'm a competitive builder, and there are maybe 20 of us, is not necessarily the same thing. That is optimal when the probability for you personally to win the next block is 50% after this one. That changes calculations quite a bit. And there are interesting things that they can do. Again, I don't want to suggest too many ideas, to be honest, because I feel like no suggesting we are in a situation where things are not great as they are. But I think that's really problematic. And again, I think this is pretty much the main issue with the performance of the chain because it gives such a big, huge premium to parties that can do sex dex arbitrage.
01:13:02.090 - 01:13:07.544, Speaker B: And Sexdex arbitrage is so valuable because the blocks are so slow.
01:13:07.704 - 01:14:06.866, Speaker A: Right. It's like, it's like if you just gave somebody a perpetual twelve second arp, right? And like, and what we saw, right, like shortly after the merge is like, you would see builders in theory, of course, like, immediately is very hard to synthesize down to exact numbers, but you would see builders theoretically losing money on blocks. But in order to sort of play these game, like war of attrition almost, right? Like, just like bleed out competitors who just simply cannot compete in sextech is such a huge part of that because, yeah, I mean, there's like, so if you have a tremendous amount of liquidity on finance or whatever, and you just have a perpetual twelve second arb, like, yeah, and I think this is, to me, I'll just say this, like, to me, I think I troll a lot about like, jared from subway and like, these like, ridiculous sandwiches you see sometimes. But like, honestly, the issue really isn't like horrendous sandwiches. It's not. People like, getting like, you know, 50% worse execution. Most sandwiches are a dollar two.
01:14:06.866 - 01:14:40.082, Speaker A: You know, you like, you go and follow these, you actually, look, I mean, it's not like, it's not like, amounts of money that appear to be just extracting, like, you know, viciously from. From retail. It's more just the consistency of having that perpetual arbitrage, you know? And I think, like that, to me, that's what I look at. I'm like, it's much more the centralizing force. Right, than the actual amount of money being extracted, which isn't great unto itself. But that's not, like, really the problem at hand, I wouldn't say. And maybe, maybe, like, I think for what it's worth, like, flashbots realize this, like, you know, Bill, Diane realizes it's not like this is lost upon people.
01:14:40.082 - 01:14:56.880, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think that I joke a lot about how, like, terrible, you know, retail just gets raked across the coals. It's not like, exactly like that. It's just more that there's always this, you know, ability to. To kind of have this, this perpetual arbitrage, like I said.
01:14:57.042 - 01:15:34.780, Speaker B: Yes. So that is certainly, again, that is certainly a big source. I wouldn't necessarily underestimate some of these sandwiches. So sandwiches can also be, I haven't looked at the data recently. I think that they end up being not very profitable to Jared. There's, the amount of payout that Jared has to make to the validator is actually much higher, but some of these sandwiches are pretty profitable as well. And then I think there is more to say on the whole thing.
01:15:34.780 - 01:16:24.774, Speaker B: But you can, of course, do sandwiches by Jared, and then you can do statistical arbitrage, and then you get the best of both worlds. But I think that the issue is that when you cannot really enter the builder market at the moment, and when the builder market is so concentrated, then all of those other things that people want to design, that people want to build, they become infeasible in a way, because nobody can control their private order flow, for example, other than maybe Beaver and Titan at the moment. Flashbots, they had interesting ideas on what to build, and they had this flashbot protect service, and that worked fine for some period. So they had their own private order flow.
01:16:24.934 - 01:16:26.326, Speaker A: Like an RPC, right?
01:16:26.470 - 01:16:27.342, Speaker B: Say it again.
01:16:27.478 - 01:16:28.822, Speaker A: It's like an RPC.
01:16:28.998 - 01:17:11.074, Speaker B: It's like an RPC, right, where you can send private transactions. They were the first ones, I believe, who did that. But then the issue right now is that they have to basically tell everyone, hey, you send something to us, make sure that you allow us to send it to everybody. Yes. If you just send something to them, than with the winning rate that they have you will have to wait forever. So basically, they have no option, essentially, but to give it away to all those other parties. And so then the issue is that how do you build something really in this environment? On the builder side, if we had really, really fast blocks, so it would be fine, rather trash, but unity appears.
01:17:11.074 - 01:17:57.774, Speaker B: Beaver takes it. But then for some period of time, there is no arbitrage opportunity, just because again, the price sort of stays within the spread. And so there is a bunch of blocks built by somebody so you could run as your own builder. Being a small company in Estonia serving estonian market only, you could still get your blocks included every now and then with really fast block times. With block times of 12 seconds is essentially winner take all. And you cannot beat over this distance over 12 seconds. You cannot really build, you cannot really outbeat and beat one of those guys who are successful at Sexdex arbitrage.
01:17:57.774 - 01:18:12.334, Speaker B: So essentially that dominates everything. So to me, it's not an issue that can be solved with some smart mechanism design. Unfortunately, this is something that just needs to be solved with raw performance improvements.
01:18:12.834 - 01:18:44.576, Speaker A: Yeah. And also, I wanted to ask you as well, like the. We've seen some increase in interest, I say interest discussion about colocation and speedy wires, people getting close to binance, people, you know, these, these builders having very low latency. Is this going to only increase in the future? I've kind of talked about other people about this, but I'm interested to hear your take. And also, is this also a very centralizing force in your opinion?
01:18:44.680 - 01:19:17.270, Speaker B: That's yes. So again, I think I'm not. I think that it is always going to matter one way or the other. I don't think that there is a latency solution. So people who say that we can run frequent batch auctions, I don't think that those really solve anything. You still have advantages from having low latency, even in frequent batch auctions. And whatever you do, there will always be disadvantages.
01:19:17.270 - 01:19:47.134, Speaker B: But when you doing something, when you're doing something over a longer period of time, usually you just have more at stake. So the advantage might even decrease. And again, that might be surprising. The way I think about it is that you can have formula f one drivers and you can see how many of them ever won a lap. That is going to be a big number. Then you can see how many of them won a grand prix. That is going to be a smaller.
01:19:47.134 - 01:20:43.812, Speaker B: And then there is only one or two in recent years. So basically, the longer you play, the more important becomes the edge, because it's essentially winner take all, and you cannot beat all those guys over longer periods, so latency is always going to matter. But when you break this down and when you make them compete faster, then it doesn't matter as much. This is sort of the surprising thing in all of this, that maybe if your latency is better than mine, but we're competing over short horizons, that maybe I might still be winning 40% of the time. But then if we compete over a longer horizon, then the advantage that you have on binance in execution, binance and everything else that accumulates over time and.
01:20:43.828 - 01:20:45.540, Speaker A: So that the economies of scale too.
01:20:45.572 - 01:21:09.134, Speaker B: Like economies of scale. So that basically just that this longer periods, usually they actually go. This is the counterintuitive part in all of this is that latency matters, and latency to all those great locations, centralized exchanges, it matters, but it matters even more when you slow down your system, when you make the system a little bit less efficient.
01:21:09.594 - 01:21:38.788, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, well, I don't. Is it that counterintuitive, though, that the price deviates more in 12 seconds than it does in 100 milliseconds? And this is something that, I don't know if that's exactly what you're saying, but like, to me, it's just like, it's very straightforward. Like, there's going to be a lot more volatility in 12 seconds than there's going to be in 100 milliseconds. Right. And so, I mean, yeah, so, like, I think this is something that it does seem like the Ethereum community has kind of rejected. And I don't say that. I mean, I don't know.
01:21:38.788 - 01:21:54.812, Speaker A: I don't want to be too critical, but like, it does seem like it's like pretty straightforward. Anatoly says this, it's not like a point of contention. It's like, not like a hill I'm going to die on because it's just like, look, it's obvious, it's clear the price moves a lot on binance in 12 seconds. Come on.
01:21:54.948 - 01:22:47.586, Speaker B: Yes. And again, since we made this a theme to compare the situation to what is happening in traditional finance, then let me just point out that exchanges also compete in traditional finance in terms of what they do. And there were different attempts to come up with something super smart. Maybe we should run some sort of auction, a short duration auction, and come up with some market structure around those lines. What ends up happening, though, is that even exchanges right now, they compete on latency very hard because exchanges are limited at what they can display at the NBBO. If I want to display an order, but it would cross the market on the other exchange that I wouldn't be able to do it. I cannot post an order on my exchange.
01:22:47.586 - 01:23:36.936, Speaker B: I have to send it out or cancel it if it comes with an instruction that don't send it to a different exchange. And so for exchanges, latency is also important. And almost none of the smart solutions worked out. And what ends up happening is that exchanges, they still compete with each other based on latency as well. And when people compete based on latency, it sounds silly to an outsider that you're spending so much money to get a tiny advantage. But at the same time, these investments, people make this investment, they of course calculate the value of those investments and apparently those investments are justified. But this is also, you should view this kind of differently, right? Because it's better propagation of information.
01:23:36.936 - 01:24:38.070, Speaker B: And information is of course valuable in those markets. And so you want to make sure that information propagates faster. You want to make sure that you create a more competitive environment for everybody. And then if I'm picked off, if I'm slow, it's fine for me to get picked off, if I picked off very, very quickly, and then if I can also cancel my order relatively quickly after that, maybe a little bit slower than those other guys who picked me off, but I can still accomplish more. So I think that for the big trade off is between applications and sort of consensus layer because they say that if we make this too fast, then consensus becomes centralized. Now you have to have fast connections and whatnot and be able to, we have validators operate at fast speeds. And so if you don't want to centralize that, then you sort of want slower systems.
01:24:38.070 - 01:24:47.950, Speaker B: But if you want slower systems, then everything that is built on top creates a centralization pressure on builders, searchers and all those other parties.
01:24:48.142 - 01:25:33.172, Speaker A: Yeah, we probably should just not trade on blockchains. Okay, on that note, I'm going to ask you one final question, and I'm sorry, I'm going, I'm going to press you on this because I think you'll give it to me straight. And that's what I want. I already asked this, but I want, I want, I want to get a real answer 20 years from now. Amms, what are we trading? And I'll like provide a little bit of context. And I already did, but I just, you know, as you can tell from a lot of my trolling, like, you see what I like, what I post on Twitter. I don't know how close you follow, but, like, you'll see what I say like, a lot of times I do feel like brilliant people like yourself, Alex, are sniped into solving extremely niche problems.
01:25:33.172 - 01:26:38.562, Speaker A: And I at least at times, want to step back and say, like, okay, yes, like, maybe we don't know what, or, sorry, sorry. Maybe we can improve these systems as they are. But, like, should we zoom out and at least have some idea as to what we are building this for? And I say this because, like, this is going to be very contentious, but we haven't shied away from this yet. Sometimes I look at something like an amm, and I'm picking on amms right now, but I think this applies to a lot of defi protocols in general. And I look at amms and my instinct is, is there a chance that amms are actually only useful for speculation? Like, because once you sort of transcend pure speculation and you try to get into efficient market making, it just, it doesn't add up to me. And so I, and so I sit here and I say, look, it's very obvious what they're good for, right? Permissionlessly launching an asset. But, like, after that, I am not so sure.
01:26:38.562 - 01:27:23.678, Speaker A: And so I do, like, I want to ask somebody who I think has a great background, traditional finance, and somebody who can hope, I don't know, probably better than myself, can see the future and say, like, okay, so in 20 years, is it ETH, USDC, and then still meme coins, or are we trading commodities? Like, and if we're trading commodities, is this the most efficient way to do it? Because they're, the underlying is still adjudicated with real world property rights. You know, like, that's something that I struggle with too. Like, at what point is it kind of like, well, what's the value if at the end of the day, it's like a real, it's a real asset that can only be, you know, ascribed property rights by a legal entity or something. So anyways, that was a long diatribe. I should be quiet, but I do want to, like, 20 years from now.
01:27:23.726 - 01:27:26.034, Speaker B: It's a fascinating question. It's a fascinating question.
01:27:26.374 - 01:27:27.474, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
01:27:28.614 - 01:28:32.350, Speaker B: We should be thinking a lot about it. I personally can't see the future 20 years down the road. I'm working on it, but it's difficult for me to tell right away. But I think that there is a good hope that what we call amms right now, they might become. You can think of those as being more sophisticated order types that could be used together with other order types that are out there anyway. So if you have a super fast chain with super cheap transactions. Then there is always a question, why don't you run an order book? All right, maybe you run an order book, but if you do that, can you run an amm on top of it and have a special order where people provide liquidity to that order and they accomplish something with this order? So, for example, maybe they get directional execution that is good.
01:28:32.350 - 01:29:33.566, Speaker B: Or maybe they actually trade back and forth using some additional information that comes from somewhere and make money that way. That remains to be seen if they can make money that way. But that is when you start thinking about this as being an additional order type, then people in traditional finance think about new order types all the time. Again, I can mention the de order that was introduced by IEX. So essentially what they do is that you place some liquidity and then at some point they have a signal that they should move it and they move it on your behalf. Isn't this something that almost looks like some oracle managed AMm in the terminology of defi in traditional finance, to introduce a new order type? For an exchange, to introduce a new order type, you need to go through some incredible process with the SEC. You need to get comment letters and whatnot.
01:29:33.566 - 01:30:03.358, Speaker B: So order types are super regulated right now. We have a little playground because we don't deal with securities. There is a little playground here. We don't deal with securities. Yes, that's right. So there is a little playground here where we can trade some of these digital things and come up with new order types and see how those order types behave. And so I don't feel necessarily that Amm is the only thing that is out there.
01:30:03.358 - 01:30:39.782, Speaker B: But there are very successful order types. There are people who use iceberg orders. Do people use iceberg orders? Probably yes. Can an order be switching from one site to another like an imm does? Probably, yes. There is value to that as well. Can an order be managed by some signal that an exchange gets from somewhere? Well, this is what we already see happening in traditional exchanges as well. So as systems become more performant, I don't see a particular issue with microstructure that would prevent those prototypes from being successful even in major markets.
01:30:39.782 - 01:31:40.202, Speaker B: Not necessarily just something that is designed for launching their own tokens or something like that. But then what is also interesting is that we can design these prototypes specifically for particular markets and have the interest of those people in mind. So, for example, you think about launching a new token right now. You look at the Amms as they exist today. Do you feel that those Amms are the best way to launch a token, you can go to one of those market makers and they will launch the token for you, and they will make markets according to some secret algorithm that they have. Or maybe you could create a market making algorithm on your own that will lose money on average, a little bit of money on average, but at the same time, it will not necessarily lose as much as you would have to pay to market makers, and it will create liquidity for your token. So that could be.
01:31:40.258 - 01:31:43.014, Speaker A: Yeah, and you created the token out of thin air.
01:31:44.834 - 01:32:26.774, Speaker B: Your question here, one last thing that I want to mention on this is that there is an interesting, so there is, of course, this famous LVR papers. There's the first LVR paper, second LVR paper. One interesting result from those papers is that there is no loss versus rebalancing. This is from the second LVR paper. If you can trade infinitely fast. So essentially, if you had very, very fast block times, this is just a mathematical result that follows from the paper. If you had very, very fast block times, if you had zero fixed cost for every transaction, then you wouldn't lose anything from using amm relative to just being a normal market maker.
01:32:26.774 - 01:33:14.504, Speaker B: So this gives me an idea that when performance of these systems improve, then the losses that are sort of inherent in this market maker strategies losses to arbitrageurs. You can make some profits from uninformed flow, but the amounts that you lose to arbitrageurs will decrease quite significantly. And then it just becomes a question for you whether you are willing to pay that cost to get something else, be it directional execution. So you trade in the direction that you want, or maybe providing liquidity for your token. But I don't necessarily see launching own tokens as the only use case for amms, because again, I view amms basically as just another order type that can very well be useful elsewhere, in particular, when the underlying system is sufficiently performant.
01:33:15.884 - 01:33:35.708, Speaker A: Okay, I will accept that answer. Emergent properties. Emergent properties are incoming. Well, Alex, thank you so much. I thought this was fantastic. You are somebody who will always give it to me straight, which I do appreciate. Where can people find you on Twitter? They should definitely follow your Twitter.
01:33:35.708 - 01:33:49.574, Speaker A: You have some long threads sometimes that there's like. Sometimes they're hard to get through, but sometimes they're quite interesting about Mev and my market microstructure and other mechanism design stuff. So what's your Twitter? Where else can people find you?
01:33:50.634 - 01:34:17.494, Speaker B: Thank you, guard. Pleasure to be here. Love your shows and love your Twitter art that you produced. It was very influential, and, uh, our crowd so, uh, I am on Twitter. I think that you can probably find me my. By my name. There is also, uh, a russian stand up comedian with the same name, but I think, uh, for Alex Diesel.
01:34:17.494 - 01:34:25.594, Speaker B: And I will probably be the first one. Or the handle is, uh, zero x 94,305. Um, awesome.
01:34:26.454 - 01:34:36.662, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much. I thought it was fantastic. We'll have you back on with Max resting next time. And, yeah, we can all design mechanisms. Thanks, Alex.
01:34:36.758 - 01:34:39.414, Speaker B: That sounds great. Thank you very much, Clark. It was a pleasure.
