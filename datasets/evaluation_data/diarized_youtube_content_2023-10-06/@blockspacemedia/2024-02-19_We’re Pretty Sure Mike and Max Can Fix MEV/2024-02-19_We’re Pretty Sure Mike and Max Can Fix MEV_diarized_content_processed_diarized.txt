00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: Three.
00:00:03.410 - 00:00:24.960, Speaker B: I am here today with Mike Nouter, who is most well known for drawing charts for the Ethereum foundation, and Max Resnick, who is the only boy to have censored the Ethereum blockchain for twelve full seconds. Welcome, guys. Thanks for coming on. Do you want to give real intros? Mike, you want to go first?
00:00:25.450 - 00:00:38.570, Speaker C: Yeah, that was pretty much accurate work at the EF. Have been there for about a year, mostly working on mev stuff and staking and. Yeah. Happy to get into some of the nitty gritty.
00:00:39.950 - 00:00:50.410, Speaker A: Yeah, we did some test blocks. So it wasn't just 12 seconds, it was like 12 seconds, like three times. So that's 36 seconds if you're counting.
00:00:50.830 - 00:00:53.306, Speaker B: Well, that's what you're known for, at least having sensors.
00:00:53.338 - 00:01:23.640, Speaker A: Ethereum, we're known for the one block, but there's two other test blocks that we also did. So really it's much more powerful. Yeah, I think that's a pretty good intro of what we do. But I work at special Mechanisms group, which is now the MEV research division, within consensus. And I work on the research side of things, mostly working on PBS research, censorship, resistance, keeping the EF on their know.
00:01:26.170 - 00:01:41.902, Speaker B: Awesome. Cool. Okay, guys, well, I thought we'd start, maybe start with you, Mike. And then obviously, Max, I'd like to hear your opinion on this question as well. So how far are we out now from the merge? The merge occurred in what, a year and three months ago or something?
00:01:42.036 - 00:01:44.030, Speaker C: Yeah, September 2022.
00:01:44.180 - 00:01:46.750, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah. Do you have that tattooed on your arm?
00:01:48.530 - 00:01:50.720, Speaker C: No, I wasn't in this space then.
00:01:51.330 - 00:01:52.446, Speaker B: Were you not?
00:01:52.628 - 00:01:55.586, Speaker C: Well, I was following, but I wasn't like, full time.
00:01:55.768 - 00:02:34.910, Speaker B: Okay. So anyways, we are over a year out from the merge, and I'd just like to hear what you guys think as to how Ethereum is doing. Maybe a very easy way to start and obviously dig into this. But if you had to grade Ethereum on a scale of one to ten since the merge, with one being not doing optimally and ten being doing very well, and also with regards to some of the reservations or criticisms or concerns that people had going into the merge, and, yeah, you can define those or talk about those however you want, but, yeah. How do you think Ethereum is doing, Mike?
00:02:36.370 - 00:03:23.034, Speaker C: Yeah, I think if we want to talk about overall performance, it would make sense to break it down into a few different categories. Right. So in terms of the execution of kind of getting proof of stake, working, getting withdrawals done, some of the kind of core features of the consensus layer that needed to be shipped, I think doing a super great job. Chappella happened without any issues in April of last year. That was the withdrawals fork. And then since then, the big focus and the big push has been 4844, which is the sharding roadmap. This kind of improves the amount of data that Ethereum produces and supplies to l two s.
00:03:23.034 - 00:04:07.222, Speaker C: This is all kind of in the vein of the roll up centric roadmap. So yeah, I think in terms of the vision there, everything makes a lot of sense, and it's kind of like a very cohesive story moving forward. I think in terms of the research, there's a lot that has been happening kind of outside the protocol that is pressing on it in a bunch of different directions. And I think that's something we're kind of coming to terms with right now. So a couple of examples of this is like the classic one is meV, right? The merge was happening right around when people were starting to pay a lot more attention to MeV. And as a result, the merge was shipped with Mevboost. This is like the sidecar software that allows proposers to interact with block builders.
00:04:07.222 - 00:04:45.894, Speaker C: And we're seeing kind of some of the negative externalities of that. There's like dependencies on these relays. There's this whole builder, centralization, builder censorship. So I think Mev is like a big vector that is kind of outside of the view of the protocol and has been shaping the direction of research and hasn't really impacted the. We haven't gotten to a point where we're ready to put something in the protocol to deal with it. Also, I think LST and stake centralization has been like a big theme. I think it's also another one of these things where there is centralization pressure and that really freaks people out.
00:04:45.894 - 00:06:08.500, Speaker C: And I think that concern is warranted, but we're also trying to figure out what exactly the right path forward is there. And then I guess kind of in the current meta, I view restaking as the next big, not necessarily like existential threat, but it's like a huge part of the narrative for this cycle, and also just something that's very close to the metal as far as what impacts the Ethereum protocol. It distorts the incentives around participating in Ethereum consensus, and it presents another vector by which centralization could be kind of forced onto the protocol faster than the protocol is able to react. So I think there's a lot going on, obviously, and I think in terms of figuring out what comes next in this hard fork, Electra is the one after Daneb that's probably being targeted for the end of this year. And I think a little more clarity and vision around what we're prioritizing and what we're building for in that time frame would be important. So I think looking back, we've done a really great job. Not maybe a ten, but whatever, like an eight or a nine looking forward, I think in this current moment, we could use a little more clarity maybe, and a little more focus for moving.
00:06:11.350 - 00:06:12.210, Speaker B: Max.
00:06:12.790 - 00:06:49.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. Well, one thing I would just want to emphasize how crazy it was that the merge went off without a hitch. I think that was like, we had some issues in lending markets around the merge that I didn't think were great, but I think it was pretty incredible that it just went off. And because it was so smooth, nobody even talks about what could have happened. So that was great. I think collectively, the community kind of took a step back after the merger was like, yay, we did it, celebrated. And then like Mike was saying, these mev things really crept up on us.
00:06:49.646 - 00:07:25.340, Speaker A: One thing I will say that I just want to say, I think we got wrong, or it wasn't me, because wasn't really that deep in the weeds at the time. So it's not my fault, just to be clear, but the stake threshold and not putting delegated proof of stake in the protocol, I think we pretty clearly got wrong. And that's kind of not necessarily causing the stake centralization issues that we're seeing today, but is causing some bottlenecks in the speed of the blockchain, I would say.
00:07:26.190 - 00:07:28.694, Speaker C: Wait, the threshold being the 32 eth.
00:07:28.742 - 00:07:49.198, Speaker A: The 32 e threshold for how much you need? Well, I think you could have it higher so that you need more eth, or you could have delegated proof of stake so that you don't need to have 500,000 nodes, many of which are just running on the same box. So you have like 50 nodes running on the same box, all making a signal.
00:07:49.214 - 00:07:55.522, Speaker C: Sorry, just to clarify, validators would be running on the same node? Usually that's just the terminology there.
00:07:55.576 - 00:07:57.300, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, sorry.
00:07:57.990 - 00:07:59.954, Speaker C: Just don't want people to get confused.
00:08:00.002 - 00:09:02.060, Speaker A: So yeah, you have 50 validators, each with their own $50,000 of each staked, all running on the same box, each generating a signature that needs to be verified at the end of the epoch, and that causes some overhead for the network. So I think that was something we clearly was a mistake. The mev stuff crept up on us and there's no way to know that would be as crazy as it has been in terms of the acceleration, but it does call into question the timelines of these things. And I think we're starting to get a little bit rushed in what we're doing, because MeV moves so quickly, and we moved from the inception of PBS to 95% blocks produced by PBS to everybody but one of the major builders censoring. And the relays also coming under that pressure really quickly. And so I think we need to be careful because we have these huge lead times before things get in. So we're talking about stuff to go into the electra hard fork now.
00:09:02.060 - 00:09:16.590, Speaker A: And we feel like we need to do something about the censorship now because it's going to come in in a year, and who knows where we'll be at that time. And that means, I think we're getting a little bit rushed in terms of what we're.
00:09:18.450 - 00:10:00.966, Speaker B: Me just. Let me just play devil's advocate here for a second, all right? Like, Max, you say that MeV crap up on us. I think you're right. You were also the one writing about integrated searcher builders. Like, how long ago is this now? Six months? Twelve months? But anyhow, my point is saying this, is that there were certainly people, and in fact there were people saying, should we delay the merge until we have some enshrined PBS mechanism. Right? I don't know. You guys can explain this better than I can, but the essence of it is, right now, there's these relays, right? These trusted relays.
00:10:00.966 - 00:10:46.762, Speaker B: And I don't want to go too rehashing this, but they take blocks from builders and then they ultimately pass them on to the validators. The reason for this is because neither can really trust each other to give them the right amount, and they don't want to dupe each other. Okay, so there were a lot of people talking about this prior to the merge. So, I mean, I do wonder some of these things. And I also have another question regarding stake centralization for Mike after this, in the same vein in terms of, like we say, this crep up on us, but sometimes a lot of people were actually saying exactly this. So, I mean, what was your inclination like, I don't know, maybe three, six months prior to the merge? I know you're maybe working on other stuff at the time, but did you not foresee this? I'm not saying I foresaw it, but I did see other people foreseeing this.
00:10:46.816 - 00:11:27.590, Speaker A: For example, there's only so much you can foresee. I was not working in MeV, so I wasn't super into the weeds until about February of 2023. So I wasn't actually super knowledgeable about the topic three to six months before the merge. In fact, that's, like about when I got into crypto anyway. So I really just was not knowledgeable about a whole lot of stuff. But at the time, if you put me in a position, if you put me right now and said you're working on MVB three months, I probably would have foreseen some of the stuff, but I don't think I would have had a perfect view of how the end game would end up. Right.
00:11:27.590 - 00:12:03.460, Speaker A: I think the data, I'm happy that we did it because we got to see the data instead of just, like, speculating about what would happen and a bunch of theories and just analysis paralysis, not doing anything. Now we see the data. The issue I see is we're not acting quickly enough, we're not iterating quickly enough such that we can see the problems that we see in the data and solve them. That's where I see the issue now, and I'm glad we have the data so we can see what actually happened and not just pontificate about it.
00:12:04.310 - 00:13:11.334, Speaker C: Yeah. Just to respond to that, I do think I also was not in the space during the merge, so kind of speaking off the hip here, but I think there was a very small subset of people that was saying we should do epbs before the merge. I think Steph, in particular at flashbots, was like the one who was advocating for this, but I think also the historical context of the merge was already such a huge lift, and there was just this bias for action, for getting it done. Like Max was saying, if you never end up shipping it because you're delaying for epbs, that just seemed like a non starter at that point in the process. So I guess I can't say that that was a bad decision in terms of the delegated proof of stake thing. And this is kind of a continuation of that same point. I think at the time, they were looking around at other chains, and when you look at the delegation, it's like almost everyone always delegates to a very small minority of the best validators.
00:13:11.334 - 00:14:17.646, Speaker C: So, for example, there's just like on Cosmos chains, it's like a very power law distribution thing where the top three or four validators get like 95% of the stake. And the reason for this is kind of like, very intuitive and almost like a psychological thing. Like, if I'm going to delegate my money to someone through the protocol, of course I'm going to choose the best validator I'm not going to be altruistic and risk my eth getting slashed by delegating to some long tail validator, because I care about the distribution of ETh among them. You know what I mean? And also I think, yeah, it just at the time didn't feel like a decision that the core protocol should make. I think less like the staking centralization feels, or I guess the LST market cap growing so large feels less of an issue about delegation not existing and more an issue about withdrawals not being enabled for like a year. So a huge piece of the puzzle here is that the beacon chain launched in 2020, right. I think it was like a couple of years before the merge actually happened.
00:14:17.646 - 00:14:55.420, Speaker C: And so in order to get liquidity on that staked ETH, there was no withdrawals. So you had to use this LST, like this derivative version of ETH, which was Steth, that was the one that cropped up and kind of gained all the market share, because otherwise you just locked your ETH in this contract and you weren't able to touch it for some unforeseen amount of time. And this was when the merge was continually being delayed. And so it was super high risk to stake natively. And so getting a liquid version of it just made a lot of sense. So I think those are the two pieces that have contributed to, as far as the delegated proof of stake story goes.
00:14:56.670 - 00:15:21.620, Speaker A: Do you think that that is what happened anyway, is people just gravitated towards the. I mean, I think what we saw is we looked at the equilibrium in delegated proof of stake chains, which, first of all, there's just less actors there that are competent. So it's not a great comparison. And we said, oh, we don't want that to happen, so we're just not going to do anything about it. And we didn't do anything about it, and it happened anyway.
00:15:23.270 - 00:16:01.706, Speaker B: Yeah. Wait, Mike, let me just further this point for 1 second. Just level with me here. Did you think that more people were going to run validators on raspberry PI's? I guess the reason I'm trying to be productive here is because there was this big, it seems to have died down, right. Because I think people have, I don't know, moved on to other things. But there was this obvious big concern about Lido crossing this threshold of, what, 33%? And I don't really have a strong opinion on this, for what it's worth. Not that my opinion matters anyways, but I don't have a strong opinion.
00:16:01.706 - 00:16:59.310, Speaker B: But what I will say is that there was very strong forces, like what you were saying, first of all, the year long lockup or unforeseen lockup of your stake. But Giorgios and Hasu, right, like two people who are pretty in the weeds on this protocol, wrote, know very long piece saying there's a very strong possibility that the stake ultimately aggregates into a single liquid staking protocol. And so I think what some people have wondered is like, this basically came into fruition and then people are sort of up and, I don't know, up in ours. I don't know if that's the right word. But you see some posts about we got to keep the stake out of Lido's hands. And I think a lot of people, at least myself, are sitting here and we're like, dude, everybody said this was going to happen. This was almost like a guarantee.
00:16:59.310 - 00:17:13.560, Speaker B: And so that's why when I do see some maybe like Ethereum foundation researchers talking about Lido, I'm like, did they think that everybody was going to run a validator on a raspberry PI? Was that what we thought?
00:17:14.250 - 00:18:25.920, Speaker C: Well, okay, I think there's two things here, right? Doing in protocol delegation kind of lends itself to the situation where it's almost much easier to stake, right? So you're lowering the barrier of entry so that almost everyone can stake. And I think the way cosmos deals with this is they set a cap on the amount of the supply that can be staked, right? But if you look at these chains in terms of percentage of supply that's actually staked, it's like way higher than Ethereum, right? Ethereum is at like 24% right now or something. And a lot of these other chains might be at like 60, 70, 80%. That's the first number to consider is like, if you don't make that easy, then instead of staking and delegating my stake, I might just hold onto that eth and use it in defi and kind of keep the circulation, keep some of the money in this properties of ETh or the asset, instead of doing this trustless thing through the protocol and going that way in terms of the second number. So that's kind of the first number, which is total amount of the supply that's staked. The second number is like kind of the distribution of the stake among different validators. Right.
00:18:25.920 - 00:19:27.730, Speaker C: That question, I think, is, yeah, it does feel like everyone kind of saw that coming, but I'm not sure I necessarily buy that it's going to be super monopolistic right now, a large percentage of the liquid staking market is owned by Lido, but there are people vampiring them. People are vying for that thing. And I think stablecoins show us that there doesn't necessarily have to be like a single monopoly version of a token. It could be a few big competing liquid staking tokens or liquid resaking tokens when that happens, that are all giving different access and different risk profiles and stuff like that. So, yeah, I guess that's kind of what I have to say to it. I think people, there was a lot of uncertainty and, yeah, I can't criticize many of the decisions they made because it feels like they made the best with what they had at the time, information wise.
00:19:29.910 - 00:20:40.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's fine to say they acted with limited information, but it's also okay to say that that was the wrong decision. Now, looking back. Right, but I don't think at the time we knew exactly what would happen, but certainly I would have guessed that we would see similar levels of centralization as we do now. I also think comparing to cosmos chains is very hard because there's nothing to do with that cosmos chain token other than stake. And that calculus of how many tokens are staked. Actually, the main input to that is what is the other thing you can do with the token? Not what is the other thing you can do with a dollar, but you have to make the decision of do I stake my eth or do I not stake my eth? If I sell my ETH because I see attractive yields somewhere else, then I've just given the ETH to somebody else who has to make that decision. So the only factor that matters is the difference between the reward ratio, which I think some of the cosmos chains set way too high relative to what the outside option is, and what the outside option is, which is like using DeFi or using it to transact or something else.
00:20:43.870 - 00:20:44.330, Speaker C: Cool.
00:20:44.400 - 00:21:22.760, Speaker B: Okay, well, okay, let's go back to Mav now. Sorry, I didn't mean to derail us from the interesting stuff. Okay, you guys are going to have to take over on this part. Mike, I want you to tell us what the Ethereum community's idea for EIP 1559 was originally. Okay. And then, Max, I want you to respond with what has actually happened and why you have, bravely, I should note, gone on a crusade against EIP 1559.
00:21:24.090 - 00:21:32.810, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I guess this isn't so much mev and more just like transaction mechanics on chain and stuff, but it all fits together.
00:21:32.880 - 00:21:36.060, Speaker B: Yeah, Max is reading back into it.
00:21:38.270 - 00:22:07.122, Speaker C: Yeah. So 1559 as originally concepted. I'm not the leading expert here, but, so I'll preface everything I say with that. If you really want the details, like you should read Tim Roughgarden's paper and talk to Barnaby. Those are the canon sources. But the way I understand it, it's a mechanism for resource control, right. We're trying to price the amount that you have to pay to get included in a block.
00:22:07.122 - 00:22:58.120, Speaker C: Right. And the way, I guess, comparing to before 1559 was implemented, there was this first price PGA situation where people were competing to get on chain by what's called a priority gas auction. So they're raising the priority fee that they're willing to pay, and it results in pretty bad execution during especially high mev periods. Right. Because you might be trying to just send a swap through uniswap, but you get immediately priced out by all these people because there's price action on the centralized exchange and all these searchers are willing to pay way more than you to get into a block. So 1559, as originally concepted was like kind of this oracle mechanism that says this is the clearing price for getting into a block. This is how much you have to pay.
00:22:58.120 - 00:23:54.680, Speaker C: And obviously it has this adjustable mechanism where if the block is overfilled, if it's above the 15 million target, then the price of entry goes up and up and up. And so it kind of is almost like this second price auction where the amount you pay isn't necessarily like, yeah, the amount you pay is basically the price that the people in the block before you were paying, plus some amount or minus some amount based on how many of those people paid that price. So, yeah, I think that's kind of the TLDR of what it was incepted to do. And it was supposed to make it a lot easier for wallets and for people transacting with the blockchain to know how much they needed to pay. Right. They have this base fee that they know if they pay, they'll get on chain in the vast majority of cases on the next slot, which I think made the UX way smoother and way more predictable for everyone.
00:23:55.530 - 00:24:09.514, Speaker B: That part, just to be clear, that part is pretty much objectively true now. Right? At least that last part. Right. In terms of almost guaranteed inclusion, that part we have. Okay, cool.
00:24:09.552 - 00:24:26.162, Speaker C: So I just wanted to clarify also the last thing I wanted to say, sorry, that I meant to bring up, but I kind of forgot, is it allows some of this fee revenue to go to the protocol rather than to the proposers and kind of like to. The protocol just is through this ultrasound money thing where you burn that.
00:24:26.216 - 00:24:32.660, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, you got it. Sorry. Yes, the burn part. Don't forget about the burn part because Max is about to talk in a second.
00:24:34.470 - 00:25:04.960, Speaker C: Right. Yeah. So previously, all of that fee revenue was just going to the proposer. So you could get extremely lucky if you were the proposer during a given slot because people were willing to pay crazy amounts. I mean, that still exists today. But if the base fee captures some of that revenue and directs it to all eth holders rather than those that are just participating in the consensus, then that distribution mechanism is possible with 1559.
00:25:07.490 - 00:25:50.058, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, I'm going to start with the burn, because I think there's like a big misconception that this allows you to distribute revenue when basically you're taking revenue away from the validators, which means you actually, for the same level of security, have to give them more revenue by inflating the token. So you're burning, but if you want the same level of security, from a theory perspective, you have to give them more rewards. And the way you do that is by inflating the token. So it's a great meme. But if you think about it from an actual economic perspective, it doesn't make sense. Unless actually Justin Drake has made this point, which I think is a valid thing to consider.
00:25:50.058 - 00:26:59.810, Speaker A: If there are tax differences in the way that we treat the burn versus the inflation, then that might change what decision the protocol should do, because we don't want to be paying more in taxes to the US government. Say, for example, if one is treated as capital gains and one is treated as income, then the one that's treated as income is going to be taxed more heavily. But from an economic perspective, ignoring net taxes, I think they're the same. And so I don't think the burn does anything other than distort the incentives for the validators to include the right transactions. Now, the other thing I want to say from my perspective, talking to people, the thing that was the biggest issue for users was this idea of users doing something and then regretting their decision later. So user regret was too high. Basically, users were either paying more than the threshold for inclusion was on the block in the first price or PGA auction, or they were playing the equilibrium, which is like, to shade how much they're willing to pay.
00:26:59.810 - 00:27:29.142, Speaker A: In the PGA, the clearing price was like slightly higher than that, but below their true value of getting on chain, and they weren't getting on chain. So both of those are regret inducing. One is I'm paying too much. When I look at the chain, it looks like I'm paying too much. And the other one is I'm paying too little to get in. If I just bumped my bid up a little bit, I would have gotten in and I would have been happy. So post talk, they're looking at the situation and saying, oh, I regret my decision.
00:27:29.142 - 00:28:34.894, Speaker A: But a priori, before the outcome was realized, they're making the optimal decision, and that's not a great experience for users. So I think EIP 1559 in some ways succeeded in addressing that for users who only want to be included in the next block. But most users don't want that. So it lets you get in in the next block. But if you're actually looking at, hey, I want to be included in the next three blocks or the next five blocks, which is actually what most users I would say want, other than the very specific mev searchers or the people who are really professional traders trying to trade, they now are in a situation which is in some ways even more strategic than what the first price auction was, where they have to guess which way the base fee is trending and set their parameters according to that. And I think that's not a great outcome. So I think it's worked in some ways in terms of targeting that ux, but only for that static model of user who wants to get into the next block.
00:28:34.894 - 00:28:51.606, Speaker A: And that also happens to be the model that was analyzed in Tim Ruffkurn's original paper, which says it's great, but if you expand the model out to users who don't necessarily need to be included in the next block, it doesn't work. So I.
00:28:51.628 - 00:29:17.070, Speaker B: Let me just ask a quick question before I forget, and maybe this is better for Mike, but both you guys can respond. Do you think that Ethereum should be designing for tax purposes in all mean? That's like a logical argument. I guess that seems valid, but at the same time, how do you think about that, Mike? Is this something that should be considered as a protocol design constraint?
00:29:19.250 - 00:30:06.400, Speaker C: I think it's a fair question. In general, my hunch would be no, because we're trying to build something that's like anti fragile, like World War three grade like, we shouldn't consider the current jurisdictional constraints as set in stone by any means. And also, obviously, tax codes across the world have very different implications for different people. And if you are very us centric or global west centric, then you might be designing something that doesn't work for people in other parts of the mean, I don't love when tax stuff gets evoked as a justification for doing something in the protocol. I guess it doesn't feel correct.
00:30:07.090 - 00:30:28.550, Speaker A: Yeah. I think, all other things being equal, if we had two mechanisms that were exactly the same in their behavior, but one of them was slightly more favorable for tax purposes, we should do the tax purpose thing, but I don't think we should sacrifice the alignment of incentives in the ecosystem in order to achieve tax purposes or a meme.
00:30:30.650 - 00:31:15.380, Speaker B: Yeah. Max, I don't know how vocal you've been about this publicly, but, I mean, you seem to think that. All right, what I have inferred, at least, maybe I'm reading between the lines, is that you seem to think that 1559 was largely to construct a meme of ultrasound money. I think functionally, you believe that, right? Like the ability to burn, you are taking coins out of the supply. This is good because now there are less coins. I have intuited this from a lot of what you said, and also on that note as well, you have more, I think, directly said that you think that this has overall reduced censorship resistance as to.
00:31:16.230 - 00:32:03.634, Speaker A: I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth in terms of what they. I wasn't around at the time. I don't know what they were thinking. I think there's a lot of people who were closely involved in this, or at least in shilling it, who wanted the burn for the meme. And I think also, it's just a symptom of a lot of people who are working on this are very heavily invested in ETH as an asset, and so they have, like, 90% of their net worth in ETH, and they have huge amounts of exposure to this asset, and that distorts their incentives away from making the best chain and towards pumping the eth price in the short term. And so people were just jealous of bitcoin with the finite money. They're like, we can do better.
00:32:03.634 - 00:32:24.940, Speaker A: We can get this burn going. And it worked at the time. I think it worked pretty well, and it still works. You still see people posting about how much is getting burned. At the end of the day, though, I don't think it's another one of those things that we shouldn't consider in the protocol, which is, like, how memeable something is.
00:32:26.030 - 00:32:28.780, Speaker B: Okay, Mike, do you have anything, like, you want to respond to?
00:32:31.810 - 00:32:55.574, Speaker C: I guess. Okay. I do sympathize with this whole, like, yeah, people who have bags want the price of eth to go up. Obviously, they're going to pump this meme because it's good for the bag. I understand that's what it looks like. I also do genuinely believe that the long term security of Ethereum does depend on Ethereum being valuable. Right.
00:32:55.574 - 00:33:49.762, Speaker C: There's this whole idea that in order to secure the network, you have to incentivize people to stake and to behave honestly as stakers. And if the network secures a trillion dollars of TVL or whatever, and the economic security, quote unquote, is very low because the amount people have staked is like of a token that's not worth very much. If ether was not worth very much, then you have that mismatch. And that issue does kind of come out in terms of weakening the security guarantees of the protocol. So yeah, I think the meme is powerful in that. And also it does make the long term issuance and security budget kind of type thing for Ethereum make a lot of sense, right? Definitely. Bitcoin has the strongest long term meme of 21 million bitcoins.
00:33:49.762 - 00:34:40.722, Speaker C: We're never going to exceed that threshold. Whereas Ethereum could be like long term inflationary. There's no hard supply cap in the same way. But in the same vein, it doesn't feel like bitcoin has a very clear long term security budget model. It depends on either the price of bitcoin doubling every happening, and then you have the same amount of security based on the amount that you're paying the miners, or it depends on there being enough usage on the base chain that the fees make up for the amount of each issuance happening, period. So that is conditioned on one of those two outcomes, whereas Ethereum's budget is always going to be kind of not conditioned on something else. It's very well defined in the burn.
00:34:40.786 - 00:35:36.134, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, we don't have to completely derail this, but I have personally had some reservations with this rationale. I mean, functionally, both networks need people to demand block space. And when you hear that Ethereum has solved the security budget problem, it's like, truly there's nothing in economics that says that tail inflation guarantees long term viability. Like people still need to pay a sufficient amount to use the block space and the validators still need to feel that they are compensated to do so. I mean, okay, we don't have to go down a proof of workers proof of stake debate, or rather bitcoin versus Ethereum security models debate. But I do think this has been well designed shilling. That was a word Max used.
00:35:36.134 - 00:36:17.878, Speaker B: I won't use that. But a well designed narrative, if you will. It's not like there's no solution. I mean, the same similar minor death spiral can occur if Ethereum's price is not sufficient. We're not talking about discovering, reinventing the wheel here. Okay, Max, quickly, now that I've gotten my piece out and I feel good about it, can you talk to us a little bit about more specifically what you think? Well, we can talk about 1559 and the censorship stuff, but maybe just, I don't know, we can start moving into censorship as a whole. What are you seeing right now?
00:36:18.044 - 00:37:25.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's another aspect of this is because you're burning most of the fees, you've changed the incentives for the person who is deciding on whether to include things or not. Before all the incentives were aligned properly with a first price, auction has maybe not as good for users from a UX perspective, but it does have two very nice properties. One of them is efficiency, which is the people who want the block space most in equilibrium will get in if they're playing properly, basically. The second thing is it's incentive aligned for the proposer who's actually making the decisions about whether to execute this protocol. To execute this protocol. In contrast, when you burn a bunch of the fees, when you burn 90% of the fee, my reward as a proposer for including you is 90% lower. And so if somebody pays me a bribe not to include you, the size of that bribe in relation to how big your tip is, is much smaller.
00:37:25.290 - 00:37:58.760, Speaker A: Right. So I think that has changed the game, and it also has changed a bunch of other things that involve inclusion and missing slots and all kinds of stuff where just like the fact that EIP 1559 exists and is diverting revenue away from the direct action and the direct person who's taking that action has made a bunch of other incentives, like the incentive to not miss slots, be out of whack with what they should be in an ideal world.
00:38:02.330 - 00:38:05.400, Speaker B: Mike, what are you working on right now to solve this?
00:38:08.990 - 00:39:42.600, Speaker C: Yeah, so I guess censorship resistance does feel super critical, and I think Max and I both view it as kind of one of the core primitives that Ethereum has. And if you give up on censorship resistance, then you kind of give up on a lot of what makes Ethereum unique and differentiated in the space. Yeah, I guess I definitely buy Max's argument that the cost of censorship is changed. And this actually Vitalik wrote about a long time ago, he drew the total price of the transaction and was like, the censorship is just the tip now, instead of the base fee plus the tip, all of that stuff in terms of what we can do from a protocol perspective, I think the latest push that I've been kind of like crusading for is this inclusion list thing. And inclusion lists are cool because it's super simple to describe, and it kind of gives some stronger censorship resistance properties back to the protocol, especially in this world where we have proposers separated from builders, and builders are building like 95% of the blocks. So I guess the quick summary of inclusion list is a proposer who wants to outsource their block can also include, with that request to outsource their block a set of transactions. Those transactions will either get included in their block or the subsequent block, and the protocol will enforce the validity of those blocks only insofar as they actually include the transactions that were in the inclusion list.
00:39:42.600 - 00:40:13.680, Speaker C: So, yeah, this is kind of like a very simple way that we can give some amount of agency back to proposers and allow them to set some constraint on their block without requiring them to build their block themselves and sacrifice all the MEV that comes with using PBS as their way of outsourcing it. So, yeah, I think that's kind of a TLDR and a big thing that we've been pushing for lately on the censorship resistance front.
00:40:15.650 - 00:40:17.390, Speaker B: Max, what do you think about inclusion?
00:40:18.930 - 00:41:24.520, Speaker A: Think? Well, I mean, first let me say that there's multiple types of censorship that we should care about. One of them is censorship for OFAC transactions like Tornado, cash, Lazarus. And I think that's what most people think about when they think about censorship resistance. And it's what's driven the recent kind of Twitter outrage or discussions about this is because a lot of the builders are censoring these transactions. So I think that's important, but it's less important than the overall censorship resistance, which is if I have a transaction, I should be able to quickly and cheaply get it on chain without having to pay an outsized bribe because somebody else doesn't want it there. And that could be because the US government doesn't want it there because it's a donation to a terrorist group, or it could be because I want to bid in an auction and there's a competing bidder in the auction. Right.
00:41:24.520 - 00:42:10.150, Speaker A: Those are both important. For me personally, I think it's even more important to just get it generally right so that we can build good mechanisms on the like. Defi innovation has completely stalled because of this bottleneck, and everybody's so focused on letting Laser's group have a playground that they're not worried about the fact that this is a huge issue for app design, and I really wish we would focus more on discussions around what the apps need to function rather than just these specific OFAC concerns. And I think inclusion lists don't actually help with the thing I care about, which is app design considerations.
00:42:14.090 - 00:42:24.250, Speaker C: I guess you said defi design has stalled. What do you think is enabled if you have more strong, immediate inclusion guarantees?
00:42:27.550 - 00:43:23.678, Speaker A: I think it breaks open a bunch of hard nuts to crack one of them. We call it the LVR problem, or the loss first rebalancing problem with these decentralized exchanges that are leaking a bunch of value to takers. That's one of them that it solves immediately, because you can just hold the auction on chain, whereas if you actually talk to the people who are trying to solve this, because the chain is deficient in this aspect of censorship resistance, and maybe we should call it short term censorship resistance, what they've been forced to do is actually leave the chain for a lot of their execution logic, which is the auction itself, and just not have it on the chain at all, because the chain is deficient in this aspect. Right. And that's not, I think, the world that we want to see. Because once you start adding centralized and external entities, you don't have decentralized finance anymore. You have centralized finance with sprinkles on top.
00:43:23.678 - 00:43:24.560, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:25.330 - 00:43:50.682, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Let me just ask this, though, and maybe Mike will have an opinion on this. With regard to Ethereum scaling, how much should we be optimizing for app design on the all one to begin with? Right. Because this is something that I think is, this is part of the discussion. People want to use Ethereum l one block space. Like somebody recently described it as kind of Lindy.
00:43:50.682 - 00:44:21.630, Speaker B: And that's true at this point. If you're using Ethereum l one block space, you kind of know how to use it. It's this fragmentation of consensus, which we can get to later. But there may be different choices, and you guys can tell me if I'm not thinking about this correctly, but there may be different choices in terms of building out the layer one if. Okay, l one is just going to be settling proofs at this point, right? So how much are we optimizing for traders on Univ. Three versus. Go ahead, Mike.
00:44:22.850 - 00:45:32.230, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think this is a really good point. And in general, I guess, kind of circling back to Max's idea that apps would be better if the protocol made different decisions about censorship. It also feels like, yeah, the protocol could be made a lot better for app designers if, for example, the slot time was reduced. And this is all kind of begging the question of if we want people to transact on the l one and apps to be built natively there, then the design decisions probably change significantly and start to look a lot more like the monolithic version. I think given conditioned on the fact that we're on this roll up centric roadmap and we're trying to allow scaling through this layered approach, I think, yeah, building specifically for the app designers at the L one feels like a bit of a strategic mistake. It's like Ethereum should be very good at being a credibly neutral base layer. It should also provide enough da so that the roll ups can do their proof, post their proof data and everything like that.
00:45:32.230 - 00:46:38.700, Speaker C: But beyond that, I think if anything, making slot times longer almost makes more sense. And trying to do whatever it takes to make that activity go to the l two s and encourage people to build their apps and deploy their apps on those environments rather than on Ethereum based chain makes a lot of sense, honestly. And I think Ethereum is still valuable in this world because it is like the source of truth. It's the ledger of record for ether, the asset, which is a very important collateral asset that hopefully will be used across the l two s. And also it's providing this pure, extremely good censorship resistance in terms of if something goes wrong on the l two, you can still force include down onto the l one and bridge your tokens to a different l two where you're not being censored. That type of censorship resistance feels much different than something that you would design for the l one to handle trading activity or auctions really smoothly. You know what I mean? So I guess that's maybe where the distinction in how we think about censorship resistance and how we think about what Ethereum is designing for comes from.
00:46:39.070 - 00:47:16.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a reasonable argument, but I do think that l two s care about censorship resistance as well. Right. Maybe they're not as time sensitive, but certainly they do care about it. And one example is like an optimistic roll up that has a seven day fraud window, because seven days is like the amount of time that they need to guarantee a fraud proof gets in. Right. I think these kinds of questions are also important for l two s, but also we have a lot of activity on the chain. That's just people who are using the chain for.
00:47:17.052 - 00:48:08.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, people still want to use ethereum l one. I guess this is kind of part of the irony is like there's still just a lot of people getting sandwiched every day on unisop. And if most of this was pushed already to these l two s, then we'd be having a different conversation, in which case maybe we would be focused more on the type of censorship persistence that you're talking about with letting Lazarus get their transactions included or whatever. So yeah, it's interesting. I mean, you're right, there's still a lot of transaction volume on the l one. What is your inclination, Max? Do you look at Ethereum and say we need to optimize to the best we can still, at least for l one volume?
00:48:09.230 - 00:48:51.460, Speaker A: Well, I think either ethereum optimizes this or somebody else does it and eats Ethereum's lunch. Right. First of all, if ethereum, all ethereum provides is a da layer that's very undifferentiated. And there's plenty of places that are going to be able to provide that for a lot cheaper than Ethereum. The thing that Ethereum is providing, why everybody's willing to pay the rents, is because there's an active financial ecosystem on the l one and they're paying rent for users, basically. So if we say, oh, we're going to give up on users, somebody else is not going to do that. Maybe Salana, maybe somebody else.
00:48:51.460 - 00:49:26.530, Speaker A: And they are going to end up with the users because they're going to end up with the apps that work and users like, so like we can give up and we can say we're going to be a DA layer. I don't think that's a great direction because I don't think that there's a lot of optionality there in terms of how you can distinguish yourself. What makes you better than bitcoin then, if you're a long slot time Da layer? Right? I thought we were supposed to be a smart contract layer. I guess we can verify the proofs, maybe that might be it, but so can everybody else.
00:49:26.680 - 00:49:33.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I think competing with a monolithic Solana style chain is just not actually what Ethereum is going to differentiate itself on.
00:49:33.672 - 00:49:34.018, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:34.104 - 00:50:43.820, Speaker C: Like, I totally agree with you that I don't think we should be just a DA layer because I don't think we're going to be able to compete with Celestia on that axis either. And I guess in my mind it feels like doing enough DA so that the optimistic roll ups, the really high value optimistic roll ups, can still use Ethereum for DA, and then providing both the kind of home base for ether, the asset and the canonical bridges, and also that World War II grade censorship, resistance and decentralization that is really what differentiates Ethereum from these other chains. Right? I don't know. Trying to compete on execution and app UX with Solana is just like fighting on their turf. And all of the design decisions up to this point have been made around keeping solo stakers and keeping that long tail of decentralization. If you give up on that, then all of the historical context kind of goes by the wayside, and we should just do the monolithic chain, you know what I mean? That doesn't feel like the right trade off to make, given where Ethereum is now.
00:50:45.230 - 00:51:04.510, Speaker A: I think we should not completely abandon it, though. I think it's not a dichotomy between focusing all in on execution and focusing all in. This would also solve the censorship resistance problem in a much more robust way than inclusionless. If we focused on solving short term censorship resistance because.
00:51:04.580 - 00:51:09.730, Speaker B: Okay, wait. Okay, sorry, go ahead. I just wanted you to flesh that out for us.
00:51:09.800 - 00:52:10.594, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I think we need to address the economic problem, which is that there isn't enough economic incentive to get transactions onto the chain, rather than trying to go and rely on altruism, which is what we've relied on. And I think what we will continue to rely on, maybe disagree. Mike? In these inclusion lists, basically, we're making an implicit assumption that somebody, somewhere along the line, is willing to go and bypass ofac sanctions out of the kindness of their heart. For us persons and other persons in western democracies, that is not a decision that they're going to make lightly, so they need to be compensated for that. So we need to address the economic issues here. So we're really relying on the solo stakers to act out of the kindness of their heart and do this well, I would rather have a system in place where they're getting rewarded for violating OFAC.
00:52:10.594 - 00:52:47.540, Speaker A: They're actually making more money if they do that. Inclusion lists don't fix the economic problem with censorship resistance, which is that if people want you off the chain, they can pay to have you off the chain, whether that's through penalties, whether that's through bribes, whatever, through the PBS auction. If people don't want you getting onto the chain right now, there's one and only one source that they get to go to under inclusionless. That would be two sources, right. Each block. But over a long period, I think that kind of washes out. It's just a factor of two.
00:52:47.540 - 00:53:08.520, Speaker A: If we could somehow fix the problem of a single or only two people being able to include you, I think that would be a lot stronger. In order to achieve the same goal than just having just going from one to two. Right. I think we need to go from one to many, one to n. Not one to two.
00:53:09.770 - 00:53:56.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's interesting. And we've kind of talked a little bit about this historically, Max, this whole and the proposal monopoly thing, and there's actually a new kind of research direction that Barnabay has been pushing for. And it's definitely this whole multiplicity thing is something that we want to learn more about. So could you just kind of explain how you expect the mechanism to work kind of in ethereum terms, and how does this work? Because when I hear the mechanism, it almost always sounds like this execution sharding thing, which to me was part of the roadmap that didn't end up materializing because of technical reasons. So I'm wondering if there's some relation here that we can draw.
00:53:56.652 - 00:54:23.280, Speaker A: Yeah, so the basic idea is that more than one person should be allowed to add to the chain in the twelve second period. Right. So how do we get there? We have more than one proposer. The issue with execution charting, which was a similar idea, is that there was an idea that this would increase the throughput of the chain because we'd have ten people proposing blocks. So we'd have ten times as many blocks and we'd be faster. Right. But then you had to figure out how to weave the transactions together, and that was the technically difficult part.
00:54:23.280 - 00:55:14.990, Speaker A: But from the perspective of inclusion, for something like a transfer, for something like a tornado cash transaction, where you're depositing or not depositing, that doesn't need to be in any particular order in the block, that's actually not related to other state necessarily. Another example of something like that is a bid in an auction or the execution of an option or something like this, that doesn't really depend on the ordering at all. And for those transactions, you don't need to figure out how to weave them in. You could just say they're in there, let's execute them all at the end. It doesn't matter the order, because they're order agnostic in that situation, it's just very easy to take the union and there's no technical difficulty in how to interleave these together. So I think that's like the difference here between that and execution sharding.
00:55:15.490 - 00:55:38.102, Speaker C: Yeah. What you're describing sounds almost like an inclusion list that's constructed by multiple proposers. Right. Because the inclusion list has many similar constraints as far as, like, we're not guaranteeing anything about ordering or pre state, post state of the transaction. We're just saying it will get included. So I do think there's this. Yeah, that property sounds similar.
00:55:38.102 - 00:55:42.086, Speaker C: It's almost like you just want multiple people to be able to construct an inclusion list per slot.
00:55:42.198 - 00:56:21.080, Speaker A: And critically, I want it to happen in a timely manner, not one slot in advance. Right. I think it needs to happen right away, not 12 seconds away, for app design reasons. I think if you're already willing to wait 12 seconds for most applications, you're probably willing to wait the amount of time it would take to get on, even in a world where a lot of people are trying to keep you off. But if you're playing D five games, you need to get on immediately. And that's why the list needs to be more than two, and it needs to be in the same slot as the execution is going to happen.
00:56:22.010 - 00:56:41.258, Speaker C: So I guess in this world it would be like you have ten people propose candidate lists of transactions, and these are all the transactions that are eligible for inclusion. And how does the execution happen in that case, then? Because if it's in the same slot, we need someone to determine the final ordering, right?
00:56:41.344 - 00:57:18.674, Speaker A: Yeah, you can have any number of orderings, but one is just to have what's called serial dictatorship, which sounds a lot worse than it is, which is just to have the first of the n proposers order all their transactions, and then the second guy comes in and puts his transactions, and then the third guy puts his transactions, and anything that's kind of in multiple blocks will be placed at the highest point, right. That it was placed by the first guy versus second guy, et cetera. So there's a bunch of simple, very simple ordering rules.
00:57:18.802 - 00:57:25.514, Speaker C: You can have one, but that just sounds like you're making the block times ten times shorter. Right. If you just do it sequentially like.
00:57:25.552 - 00:57:57.860, Speaker A: That, it's not the same, because from the perspective of holding, like an auction, right, you want everybody's bids to come in at the same time. You don't want some people have to bid earlier than others just because they're more likely to be censored. Like if everybody's trying to wait for information about the world to be revealed. It's very different to have twelve people proposing a block at the end of a twelve second period than one person proposing a block every second.
00:57:58.170 - 00:57:59.638, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fair.
00:57:59.724 - 00:58:41.890, Speaker B: Okay, let's zoom out for 1 second. I just have a more high level question for both you guys. So, Phil, Diane, who's the kind of considered the godfather of Mev? I think he's been referred to that before. The head of flashbots, he gave a talk, I don't know, a couple years ago. Now, this was probably at the beginnings of the real MeV discussions, and he brought up a very interesting point, which I've always thought about this, with regards to a system having a lot of MeV versus a system having not a lot of MeV. Okay, but that was a little bit garbled. Here's his point.
00:58:41.890 - 00:59:39.346, Speaker B: He was saying that proposers should have the right, like as the monopolistic power, for 12 seconds, they should have the right to put whatever they want inside of a block. And he sort of compared this to like, if you're, I forget what he said, maybe like the postal service, and, you know, you're transporting something illegal, should you have the right to not do that? Because you know it's illegal to do that. And the essence of it was, look, when you are chosen as one know many proposers, should you have the right to include or not include whatever transactions you want. Interestingly enough, Vitalik, this is sort of the inverse of this. I don't know if it's exactly the inverse, but I'm giving the other side of this. Vitalika sort of said, look, ideally, long run, we have a system where proposers aren't actually aware of the contents of the block. They really have no idea what they're adding to the blockchain.
00:59:39.346 - 00:59:50.694, Speaker B: They don't know what the transaction type is, who it's coming from. I think this is sort of like, what is it not threshold encryption, what's it called?
00:59:50.892 - 00:59:53.994, Speaker C: Encrypted. Encrypted input generally, yeah.
00:59:54.032 - 01:00:31.974, Speaker B: So I don't know. It is interesting. And the reason I want to ask you two is because I think I thought about this, and I don't know if this is apt or not, but with something like bitcoin, the premise is that eventually somebody will include your transaction if you pay a sufficient fee. Right. With something like Ethereum, maybe this dynamic changes a bit. With the existence of very large amount of mev and the ability to extract more from a protocol, it changes this dynamic a lot. Right? Because someone can theoretically censor you forever and it not cost them much.
01:00:31.974 - 01:00:42.410, Speaker B: And this is like, when I'm talking about where I want to zoom out, it's like, this is an interesting, Mike, you're looking like you're already disagreeing with the premise.
01:00:42.750 - 01:00:55.674, Speaker C: Well, I guess I don't see how it costs you more in Ethereum to censor, or how it costs more in bitcoin to censor than in Ethereum just because of the base. Like, is that the only difference?
01:00:55.712 - 01:01:16.420, Speaker B: Well, I mean, actually, primarily because there's not a tremendous amount of mev on bitcoin in theory. There's not a lot of. I'm trying to think of a way to say this that's not just sort of like, it's primarily peer to peer transactions. Right.
01:01:17.590 - 01:01:28.120, Speaker A: The fees are dominated by the MeV. And so the transaction fee that you pay is just negligible relative to the other things that the builder is doing. Is that what you're saying?
01:01:28.590 - 01:01:50.654, Speaker B: Because there are so many ways to make money with how you order transactions in Ethereum. Right. Like there's so many external ways that builders make money. They can just not include somebody. It doesn't cost them a lot to not include somebody. Right. Like over a large sample size, it may not cost them a lot.
01:01:50.654 - 01:01:52.174, Speaker B: You're disagreeing again, we're going to have to add a.
01:01:52.212 - 01:02:06.134, Speaker C: But it doesn't cost a bitcoin miner anything to leave a transaction out either. Bitcoin profits for miners are dominated by the issuance from the protocol, not from fees. Right. It doesn't cost them anything to leave it all out.
01:02:06.252 - 01:02:29.626, Speaker A: But if you have a transaction that has like $100 priority fee on Ethereum right now, it does cost Beaver build or whoever quite a bit to not include them every block because they may be winning already. But if they included that transaction, they would be getting $100 more. Right? Yeah.
01:02:29.648 - 01:02:33.050, Speaker C: So that makes it sound like Ethereum has a higher cost of censorship.
01:02:33.210 - 01:02:37.774, Speaker A: No, I think it's the same. It's like the same cost.
01:02:37.892 - 01:02:40.014, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's the same when.
01:02:40.052 - 01:02:51.106, Speaker A: The builders have a bunch of revenue that's coming from other sources. I think it may be that it gets dwarfed. Right.
01:02:51.208 - 01:03:15.402, Speaker B: The bulk of fees in bitcoin are like, my God, it's purely a transaction fee. Right. Whereas in Ethereum you could theoretically censor for a period of time or maybe indefinitely because you're making so much money elsewhere. Do you not agree with this premise? I'm really not articulating this. Well, I guess.
01:03:15.536 - 01:03:25.562, Speaker C: No, I guess in my mind, it's like if you look at the total revenue of a bitcoin miner, the fees are nothing anyway. So just leave the whole transaction empty and just mine the block.
01:03:25.626 - 01:03:33.802, Speaker A: But every miner has the same block reward, whereas Beaver has a different reward for their block.
01:03:33.866 - 01:03:34.430, Speaker B: Yes.
01:03:34.580 - 01:03:35.440, Speaker A: There we go.
01:03:36.850 - 01:03:42.622, Speaker B: This is what. Yes, yes. Because of exogenous ways to make money.
01:03:42.756 - 01:03:43.294, Speaker A: Right.
01:03:43.412 - 01:03:44.720, Speaker B: You see what I'm saying?
01:03:45.370 - 01:03:51.222, Speaker A: In bitcoin, the difference between the best block packer and the worst block packer is like nothing.
01:03:51.356 - 01:03:52.754, Speaker B: Yes, Ethereum.
01:03:52.802 - 01:04:03.578, Speaker A: The difference between the best block packer and the second best block packer is so much bigger. Like is orders and orders of magnitude bigger than the difference between the best bitcoin block Packer and the worst one.
01:04:03.664 - 01:04:26.290, Speaker C: Right. But in terms of the actual Distribution of people producing blocks, that doesn't mean that 99% of blocks are packed by Beaver. You know what I mean? It's like if that outcome led to Beaver packing all the blocks, I would agree. But because there still is a number of builders and there is a tale of solo stakers that are proposing their own blocks.
01:04:29.270 - 01:04:58.694, Speaker B: Yeah, let me flip this on. Let me ask this question in another way. Okay. Why is Beaver able to censor OFAC transactions and not assume that that is over a large enough sample size, a death knell for their business. Like effectively, blockchain should be designed such that if you are willing to censor continuously over the long run. Right. That should be like, you will not compete.
01:04:58.694 - 01:05:01.790, Speaker B: But would you agree or no?
01:05:01.940 - 01:05:15.586, Speaker C: It's definitely not how bitcoin is designed. If a bitcoin miner produces 20% of blocks and censors ofac transactions on bitcoin, they're not going to go to zero. Their 20% is still going to be.
01:05:15.608 - 01:05:23.698, Speaker A: 20% of the hash rate, but they're going to be paying more like their competitive advantage in terms of the.
01:05:23.784 - 01:05:35.720, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. In theory, the competitive advantage over the long run by censoring should decrease. That is what we are trying to do here, I think. Right.
01:05:37.050 - 01:05:37.510, Speaker C: Okay.
01:05:37.580 - 01:06:08.770, Speaker A: The problem, I think the thing that we're not talking about is that the tension of a bunch of oFAc transactions that want to get in gets released as soon as they get in. And there aren't that many of them. There just aren't a huge volume of them paying high tips. And they come into the mempool and then eventually there's a block which Beaver and Titan are competitive enough that Titan ends up winning because they have the extra transaction. And then that relieves all the tension and Beaver can go back to winning blocks while they're censoring.
01:06:11.030 - 01:06:14.434, Speaker B: Mike, thoughts are now.
01:06:14.632 - 01:06:43.486, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess so. Maybe the thing that you're saying is that the marginal, let's take issuance and block reward out of the equation. Like block reward for bitcoin and issuance for Ethereum. The difference between a bitcoin miner leaving out a transaction and beaver leaving out a transaction is very different between how competitive they are with the other builders in their respective ecosystems, is that what you're saying?
01:06:43.508 - 01:06:44.080, Speaker B: Correct.
01:06:44.450 - 01:06:57.360, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, I think I follow that. Yeah. I'm not sure that not having any mev in the ecosystem is the right way to deal with it. Right.
01:06:58.210 - 01:07:48.590, Speaker B: No, but no, I'm not disagreeing on that. I think I'm more pointing out that when there are exogenous, and once again, this is already very loosely defined. And also to the t, we don't know exactly how much Beaver and Rsync and Titan are making. Right. Because they have all this money elsewhere, they have all this money on binance, they have all this money on these exchanges and dexes and other chains and so on and so forth. But because there is ways to make money outside of the protocol, they can potentially, maybe you just screwed the premise, still censor and continue to gain market share, potentially again without, once again. Now, going back to what you're saying, like losing maybe their competitive advantage.
01:07:48.590 - 01:07:58.338, Speaker B: And if anything, I think the numbers sort of support this occurring in practice. Right. Beaver continues to gain market share. So I don't know what you guys.
01:07:58.344 - 01:08:32.942, Speaker A: Think of like, this is the point I'm making about relieving the tension. It's like while there is an OFAC transaction paying a fee, Titan has an advantage, right, because they're including it. So then they are able to pay more. And even if Beaver wins, they have to pay more for the block because Titan is willing to pay more for the block. Right. So as every block that Beaver doesn't include this transaction, that's another little plus in the Titan column. Right? And so even if Beaver continues to win, they have to pay more every block that they.
01:08:32.942 - 01:09:05.500, Speaker A: And eventually there's a point at which there's like no Mev going on or something good for Titan happens and Titan wins, or some other builder wins and includes the transaction. And then that takes the transaction out of the men pool. And now the next block, we're back to even playing field. So it doesn't necessarily build up and make it so that you're uncompetitive in every block. It's like a little advantage. And again, it is little because there just aren't that many transactions and they don't pay that much. And IP 1559 makes them pay even less.
01:09:05.500 - 01:09:17.310, Speaker A: And that little advantage is not enough to outweigh the advantage that Beaver has in terms of other Meb extraction ability.
01:09:17.730 - 01:09:18.094, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:18.132 - 01:09:20.458, Speaker B: Okay, so then go ahead, Mike.
01:09:20.634 - 01:09:39.606, Speaker C: No, I think that whole line of reasoning makes sense to me. I guess I'm not convinced that there's a good way to accurately allow or reward someone more accurately for participating in the censorship resistance. You know what I mean?
01:09:39.628 - 01:09:42.840, Speaker B: No, I don't think there is. No, I don't think there is.
01:09:43.370 - 01:09:53.206, Speaker A: Yeah, well, there is. If you have multiple proposers, then you can charge conditional tips and you can make it really costly to sensor.
01:09:53.398 - 01:10:04.000, Speaker B: Let's zoom back out, but in a different way. Are you guys concerned about the centralization that we're seeing in builders right now?
01:10:04.610 - 01:10:50.214, Speaker C: Yeah, for. Yeah, I guess. In terms of all the three major builders like Beaver, R sync and Titan, all are competing for the HFT, centralized exchange, decentralized exchange flow. Both Beaver and R sync are generating that flow internally. Titan's externalizing where they get that flow from. But yeah, the fact that almost all of the value in the block is being dominated by that feels like a real problem. And I guess just in terms of also the memetics of having three entities produce like 90 ish percent of Ethereum blocks feels like a really bad look.
01:10:50.214 - 01:11:01.562, Speaker C: Do you see the proposer monopoly stuff, this multiplicity gadget as addressing builder centralization, is that a vector to deal with builder centralization?
01:11:01.706 - 01:12:00.770, Speaker A: Yeah, because the reason that builder centralization exists is because the apps cannot design in a way that doesn't leak mev. There's user demand for apps on Ethereum, like financial applications. Clearly users are using apps, right? And the only way to design an app that meets the demand is to leak a ton of mev, which takes quite a bit of skill to harvest, right? Like for example, these amms, which are leaking a bunch of money every year, and the liquidations, which are leaking a bunch of money, right? If you allow the apps to solve those problems by giving them better tools, then the difference between the best builder, no matter how much smarter they are, and the second best builder will be smaller, right? Or the difference between the top three and the rest will be smaller. Because no longer do you have these 60 eth opportunities coming along that only a few people can harvest because they have a trading firm in the backyard.
01:12:03.030 - 01:12:19.494, Speaker C: Let's take the premise that most of the competitive edge of these builders is from their sex decks arbing, then no matter how well you design, I guess then you're just saying we need the amms on chain to be better designed to not leak that Mev. That's what you're saying.
01:12:19.612 - 01:13:27.934, Speaker A: So suppose there's two levels of some world, right? There's like people on the top level who walk around carrying water buckets from one place to the other, right? And these guys make money by bringing water back and forth okay. And then there's people on the bottom level who pick up the water, and they put the water back in the reservoir or something like that, right? Or maybe they just pick up the water and they make money with the water. The more water they get, the more money they make. If you give everybody at the top level a leaky bucket, and so they're always leaking water down to the second level, then the people on the bottom level who are best at collecting water are going to have way more water than everybody else, because there's tons of opportunities for them coming down the pipes, right? If you give them a bucket that actually holds the water, there's less water coming down to the basement level. And now, no matter how good at collecting water you are, there's only so much more water you can have than anybody else, because there's only so much water coming down. This is the same idea. There's people who want to have water up at the top level, at the app level.
01:13:27.934 - 01:13:52.120, Speaker A: There's people who want to trade, and the only thing we've done is say, here's the leaky bucket. Go ahead and provide them. X times y equals Kam iteration 15. And unfortunately, it's going to keep leaky because we refuse to address censorship resistance. And now we're all worried about the fact that there's, like, somebody's really good at picking up the water, who's building 50% of the blocks, well, just stop leaking the water.
01:13:53.290 - 01:14:11.680, Speaker C: But is the leaky bucket because of censorship resistance or because of long slot times? Is uniswap design constrained by the fact that, is Amm design limited by the fact that you don't have real time censorship resistance guarantees on.
01:14:13.410 - 01:14:24.718, Speaker A: It's. It's limited by that fact. Exactly. Because we have an auction that captures the revenue. We have the PBS auction capturing the revenue. Right. Like somebody's capturing it.
01:14:24.718 - 01:14:50.300, Speaker A: The validator is capturing it. If the chain could run the auction itself, it could run the exact same auction, and it could capture it and give it back to the LPS. Right. So if the chain could just run an auction, it would be able to run an auction, which is just as effective as a PBS auction, capture 95% of the revenue, and the amount of water that would be leaking down the amount of mev would be reduced by 95% for that particular opportunity.
01:14:50.830 - 01:15:02.134, Speaker C: So you're saying the weakness of the protocol, censorship resistance allows or disallows auctions to be conducted on chain that would rebate that value back to the LP.
01:15:02.182 - 01:15:27.720, Speaker A: Right. So then the auction has to happen off chain through the PBS auction. And the PBS auction captures a bunch of revenue. Like, if you look at the opportunities here, it's really in the realm of 95% on the major pairs. Right? And we could feasibly imagine that happening one layer up at the app layer if we just gave them the right tools to do it.
01:15:28.410 - 01:15:41.530, Speaker B: Okay, wait, can you just clarify for a second? What auction mechanism are you talking about here? That the protocol itself should be running with the buckets and the leak gear buckets.
01:15:43.870 - 01:15:45.914, Speaker C: We need, like, a grand theory here.
01:15:45.952 - 01:15:48.970, Speaker B: Pull it all. What are you referring to?
01:15:49.120 - 01:16:18.442, Speaker A: There's users who want to trade on the chain, who want to trade ETh for USDC. Right. The best way we figured out to do that on the current Ethereum chain is to run what effectively is x times y equals k amm with a few extra steps, which is uniswap v three. Right. Everything else that's, like, on chain for trading is either worse or has a centralized entity. Okay. We know there's people who just want to trade on chain, so they have to be on chain.
01:16:18.442 - 01:17:01.026, Speaker A: The best thing we know how to do is uniswap v three or something that looks like it. And the problem with that is prices change between blocks. And so the order book or the exchange or the Uniswap v three pool has a stale price when the prices change externally. Okay. We know how to address that, or at least to capture revenue from that opportunity, because it's happening in the PBS auction when prices change a bunch. Ethereum goes from 1950 to 2000 in a block, and there's a huge arbitrage opportunity. The price to win the block in the PBS auction is much higher.
01:17:01.026 - 01:17:22.810, Speaker A: Why? Because there's a bunch of people who know how to capture the opportunity and they bid in the auction. Right. So feasibly, you could have that auction in the protocol, if the protocol was able to run the auction. Instead, it's happening at the PBS layer because you can't run it internally.
01:17:24.030 - 01:17:42.320, Speaker B: You need to ask finance to tick every 12 seconds. This has always been my idea. I've said this multiple times. If you went to finance and said, would you mind moving ETH prices every 12 seconds? It would truly solve so many problems.
01:17:44.610 - 01:17:52.820, Speaker A: Yeah. And then you would still have the same issue because some other exchange would come about and do continuous pricing. Right.
01:17:54.310 - 01:17:56.440, Speaker B: Okay, Mike, you can respond. Seriously? Sorry.
01:17:58.250 - 01:18:59.180, Speaker C: No, I think I am following your line of reasoning, which is basically, I guess, to put a cap on it or to try and summarize real time censorship resistance has real impacts in terms of what app design can be created, and that app design can thus reduce that total amount of mev produced by the system, thus reducing the centralization of the builder market in the first place. It seems like that's the three step view of what you were just saying with the bucket analogy. And yeah, I think if that's correct, then, or that train of thought makes sense to me. What I'm not so sold on here so far is that there's a good design that works to get this real time censorship resistance property. That's what I think is more of the unknown in my. Like, everything that follows after feels intuitive in some regard.
01:18:59.630 - 01:19:02.700, Speaker B: Max, can you show us your design if you don't.
01:19:05.390 - 01:19:52.090, Speaker A: Need to? First of all, I'm not like a distributed systems person, so there's people who are better at this than me, which is why I haven't gone in and fully specked out. Here's how this would actually work. But the basic idea that we've suggested, one idea is called multiplicity, which is you have a single proposer still. But when the proposer sends the block off to the attesters to attest to, the attesters can add bids or other things that need to be included in their attestation. So I think on Cosmos, they call this like AbCi plus plus or something, but I like to call it multiplicity because that's what we called it. Elijah night. But the idea is very simple.
01:19:52.090 - 01:20:00.800, Speaker A: Just put the bids in a place where we already have a bunch of collective input, which is the attesters, and let them do the censorship resistance for you.
01:20:04.930 - 01:20:45.580, Speaker C: Yeah, I think these types of things do make sense in general, in terms of relying on the validator set, being honest majority to contribute their data to the protocol. I guess I'm not sure, from the implementation perspective, how this changes the data requirements. Right. If each attestation has to come with a bundle of transactions, it's like almost the equivalent of a bunch of blocks being passed around the network simultaneously, which I'm not sure how that would work out, but, yeah, I think the right path forward here is to think through how this design would apply in the Ethereum context and try and spec it out.
01:20:46.270 - 01:20:56.800, Speaker A: Yeah, but again, I'm like a mechanism designer. I can tell you that economically what you're doing doesn't make sense, but I'm not a distributed systems engineer. Luckily, we have plenty of very smart people.
01:20:58.530 - 01:21:15.140, Speaker C: And this is, again, where I'll plug barnabas rig open problem. He's explicitly asking people and soliciting feedback and help on this exact problem, this multiplicity thing. So hopefully someone listening to this can come figure it out.
01:21:16.470 - 01:21:58.100, Speaker B: Okay, so somebody tell me what suave is. And is suave happening? Well, actually, let me take that back. Look, this is another blockchain. What we're talking about is another blockchain, right? So is this something though, that the protocol Ethereum foundation or community is working with flashbots? Because flashbots, I think, sort of know public good, allegedly, that has of a lot of the mev infrastructure. Right? Is this something that, for example, Mike, are you working with flashbots on swab, or is this now sort of a separate project?
01:21:59.590 - 01:22:40.030, Speaker C: Yeah, no, there's no formal relationship between, I guess, flashbots and the Ethereum foundation. And I think they're both just like actors in the space. What I see suave as is kind of their vision for what a distributed and privacy first block builder could be. Right? Like this idea, it's almost like a private mempool, like an encrypted mempool, where transactions get sent to these suave nodes that are running in this tee environment. And the block construction, or the bundle construction, happens in that trusted environment before being forwarded onto the builder. So I think that's kind of the. At least that's the vision of swab that I've heard pitched.
01:22:40.030 - 01:23:53.030, Speaker C: I can't comment specifically on what their long term roadmap and stuff is, but I think it's a real credible push in that direction of trying to make block building slightly more decentralized, and try and capture some of this cryptography and encrypted mempool magic that comes from being able to run in the tee. That's, to me, what I see as the real value add. What I think is remaining to be seen, in my mind, is just in terms of competing on the block building scale, like we were talking about earlier, it takes huge amounts of sophistication to compete, and lots of liquidity on exchanges and stuff like that. What's not clear to me is suave feels like it's premised on the fact that they get so much exclusive order flow through the suave tees, that they can just outcompete purely based on order flow, and not have to compete on the other dimensions that the builders are fighting over. So I think that's where the proof will have to come in the pudding, just in terms of both performance in order flow and latency optimizations and stuff that goes into the engineering side. I'll pass it off to max.
01:23:54.490 - 01:24:50.426, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I should plead the fifth on this one, but I think I've been bearish through several iterations of what swab is. I think the builder part of it came about at a time when flashbots was winning tons of blocks in the early PBS auction, because they had a bunch of order flow that nobody else had, namely flashbots protect. Right. And they also, in some ways, were technically more capable because they had built the system and they knew what the intricacies of the relays were. They had a lot of advantages at the time, and I think they thought, maybe incorrectly, that building was easier than it ended up being. So that's one thing. I think there's other things that swap can do.
01:24:50.426 - 01:25:50.906, Speaker A: But let me just talk about this specifically decentralized builder thing. There's a story that if you leave your laptop unlocked around the paradigm office, somebody will come and put a script into your terminal that every time you type a command sleeps for 1 second, and it sleeps 1 second more every time you run a command. I think that's like what has happened in the swab design is just like continually adding latency after latency after latency, and layer after layer after layer. And this is a high frequency setting, and you can't just delay yourself for 1 second even. But certainly more than 1 second is absolute no go. We'll see if they are able to attract enough order flow to compete despite that huge latency disadvantage, which is furthered by SGX. But I doubt that they'll be successful at block building.
01:25:50.906 - 01:25:58.400, Speaker A: Other stuff maybe we'll see. Selling Taylor Swift tickets, who knows? I'll give Taylor a call and see if she's interested.
01:26:00.050 - 01:26:57.620, Speaker B: Yeah. On that note, you've talked recently about these timing games, right? That builders are playing, and also, I know this is adjacent, but are you concerned about the centralization vectors of the necessity for extremely good latency? I think the short answer is yes. But what about you guys? How do you look at this and you see how imperative speed and good connectivity and fiber optic is at this point? Is this something that's very concerning, or. I mean, Mike's going to say ten minute block times, we're good to go, but what are you guys seeing right now in terms of latency and also maybe more high level? Is this concerning for the long term? Are we trending back just towards HFT games? Colocation, same type stuff?
01:26:59.110 - 01:27:40.794, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny, Max and I were literally on a Twitter spaces an hour and a half ago, literally all about timing games. So maybe the most interested listener can go listen to that recording. But yeah, I guess in short, very concerned about latency and timing games. I think this is not only it increases the amount of sophistication to accurately and profitably participate in this protocol, but also just in terms of speed of light, geographic decentralization things. The colocation becomes a very strongly centralizing force and it also becomes a vector by which you fall into one specific jurisdiction.
01:27:40.842 - 01:27:41.054, Speaker A: Right.
01:27:41.092 - 01:28:43.022, Speaker C: Like if all of the builders are running a US east one and Europe west, whatever, or maybe the data center in Tokyo, then the US government and the japanese government would have a lot more influence over potentially what could happen. And I think this is why Phil, in a lot of ways, has been skating ahead of the puck for a really long time. He published this post called you should be a geographic decentralization Maxi, or like why ethereum needs you to be this or something like that. So definitely refer to him to check that. I again, this kind of feels a bit like an impossibility. Like I don't know that there's any good answer to like, of course things that are centralized and vertically integrated are going to be more efficient and they're going to make more money, I think maybe making sure that it's still possible to run a solo staker from South America, even if you're not as profitable as running in the Beaver Bill data center. But yeah, it's super concerning.
01:28:43.022 - 01:28:51.640, Speaker C: And I don't know that there's a cut and dry. This is how you fix latency. These things are really inherent to the systems, I think.
01:28:54.250 - 01:29:44.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the other difference here is in Tradfi, they've learned how to harness these timing games. Well, first of all, let me say these are games. And so what matters is not being fast, but being faster than the other person. It's kind of like in chess, at the highest level, at the engine level, 3500 level chess. White is like the only person who ever wins a game in these engine matches, right? Black almost never wins. And it's true, even at the grandmaster level, at the highest grandmaster level, that simple tempo advantage of moving first just gives you so much of an advantage. Actually, this game is more about moving after the other guys, having more information, seeing things later in terms of what happens on chain.
01:29:44.034 - 01:30:27.590, Speaker A: But what I'm saying is, in tradfi, they've learned how to harness these latency games. So while they are paying a ton of money for microwave towers to go from 13 milliseconds to twelve milliseconds, which is not admittedly a great use of money if you're kind of the social planner, what they are doing is they're fixing the leaks in the bucket. In the system. Why? Because in tradfi, they have this price time priority mechanism. In crypto, we only have price priority. In Tradfi, it's price time priority. And so if you're the first person to pick off a stale quote, you get to pick off the stale quote.
01:30:27.590 - 01:31:17.634, Speaker A: What that means is as soon as a quote gets stale in Tradfi, it gets picked off. So it doesn't get any more stale. So as soon as something gets stale, it gets picked off, and you cut your losses as soon as possible. So as you get faster and faster in the system, as these games start to go on, you have less and less stale quotes on the books because they get picked off immediately before they can lose any substantial amount of money. And of course, this doesn't work when there's a huge jump in the price, but as long as the price is moving kind of relatively continuously, we actually know how to harness latency. Now flip that back to crypto, we don't know how to harness latency. And so all of the money that's getting spent on getting faster, these HFT games, I think, is just dead weight loss.
01:31:17.634 - 01:31:26.920, Speaker A: Basically going to trying to beat the next guy and not improving spreads for anybody, not improving the leakiness of the bucket at all.
01:31:28.350 - 01:31:28.666, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:31:28.688 - 01:31:52.158, Speaker B: I mean, there's also, like, regulatory constraints that a lot of these HFT guys have to work with in tradfi. Right? Like best bid or whatever, national best bid. There are rules. We don't have rules. Which is also what makes it fun, I suppose. Cool. Okay, well, all right.
01:31:52.158 - 01:32:39.086, Speaker B: We've talked a lot about Mev. I feel like we pretty much solved it. For that matter, once Max sends over his idea and has Mike and the distributed systems guys actually put it into production code. Okay, let's just talk about maybe something else. The last bit. What do you guys think about how Max, I think, has some opinions on this, how Ethereum core devs are funded, the protocol guild? Are there skewed incentives? Are we doing a good job with how we finance people who build these systems? Either one of you? Mike, it's kind of geared towards you, I guess. If you want to go first or.
01:32:39.108 - 01:33:53.462, Speaker C: Max, I'll say a tiny thing and then pass it to Max, which is just like, yeah, obviously very biased as a member of the protocol guild. But I think what it's trying to do makes a lot of sense, which is kind of at the more human layer, realign the incentives between contributing to something that benefits a lot of people, this public good of Ethereum as a protocol and also just encourage people to continue. I think a lot of people get opportunities once they've kind of made their contribution to the core protocol and then take those opportunities to leave. And thus there's some amount of churn in general that seems like something to avoid. So yeah, I guess the vision of keeping public goods alive and using redirecting some of the value created by those public goods to support them feels like a really noble and worthwhile cause in the first place. Right now I guess the analogy to compare to is how open source tools are maintained and generally speaking open source tools outside of the crypto ecosystem. I'm saying there's kind of like a few different models here.
01:33:53.462 - 01:34:35.830, Speaker C: There's like the big tech companies will just have someone on their team maintain this tool because it's important for their long term viability. There's like the red hat version where there's like an open source thing and then there's open source Linux and then there's the red hat version where they offer support and they help kind of cater to the people who don't have all the technical details to run open source software and consume this thing. But yeah, I guess in general I really like that vision for funding public goods and keeping people involved in the community, but obviously very biased from a protocol guild members active.
01:34:37.690 - 01:35:20.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it definitely makes sense that people who contribute to the core protocol are compensated at a level that prevents them from moving elsewhere and doing other things that aren't as beneficial to the public. I do have some concerns with the way that it's funded, which is basically we're trying to fund public goods and we do that through what's basically charity of going to a bunch of projects asking them to give 1% of their token supply. And I kind of wish it was just some percentage of the burn that went to it rather than. I know that's, that's.
01:35:20.926 - 01:35:23.060, Speaker B: Wait, I had no idea about this.
01:35:23.750 - 01:35:25.846, Speaker C: This has been a topic before.
01:35:25.948 - 01:35:54.586, Speaker B: Yeah, this is great. I honestly had no idea you thought this, Max. This is like Hayden from Unisoft has said something along these lines. So you wish the protocol itself. As you know, the problem with this, the argument has been that this sort of takes away from the credible neutrality of the protocol in that regard. And I don't know how does it.
01:35:54.608 - 01:36:41.210, Speaker A: Not take away from the credible neutrality of the protocol to have 1% of uniswap tokens? That's like even worse to me than just the fees. Like hey, we know that fees are what the protocol needs to do in the long run is generate fees. So I think it's actually very aligned to have people at EF having a portion of that. Just like in a venture firm, you have carry in the things that you invest in. But here we have a situation where I think you might have the 1% from. It's almost like, hey, give us 1% of your token and then we at the f will act in a credibly neutral way other than the fact that we have 1% of your token. So we're probably not going to do anything that completely wrecks you like enshrining your whole thing.
01:36:41.210 - 01:37:04.370, Speaker A: But can you imagine if EF had 1% of lido and that's like a big portion because it's like venture scale returns. So that's like a big portion of their comp is like in lido tokens, and then they're like, oh, well, we think that enshrining delegated proof of stake at this point would be the best thing to do, but it would also kill the lido token valuation. And we all have a bunch of lido token.
01:37:09.450 - 01:38:00.530, Speaker C: I want to say one thing here, which is that we're using the EF and the protocol guild as synonyms, but they're actually very different entities. The protocol guild is originally, as concepted was for core devs, more so than Ethereum foundation researchers. So just to say that a lot of the people in the protocol guild don't necessarily get paid by the EF, they have other funding sources. Yeah. In terms of the credible neutrality, I definitely do see your point that it almost is like an alignment tax. If you donate 1% of your tokens to this thing, then the protocol will be designed in such a way that it's favorable to your thing because that is aligning your incentives with them. And also just like the memetics of, hey, we're the good guys, we're aligned with Ethereum.
01:38:00.530 - 01:38:24.246, Speaker C: I think that's super damaging to, that feels like inherently wrong to me. I guess I don't feel like the social pressure on projects to donate 1%. That shouldn't be the reason they do it. It shouldn't be like we're shaming people who don't do it. I think it's like, yeah, I don't know that I have a good answer honestly for this, other than my doorman.
01:38:24.358 - 01:38:30.958, Speaker A: If I don't tip my doorman. Right. It's my know, it's like whatever. I can do whatever I want, right?
01:38:31.044 - 01:38:32.650, Speaker B: You would have a doorman.
01:38:32.810 - 01:38:34.430, Speaker C: Okay, I live in New York City.
01:38:34.500 - 01:38:35.120, Speaker A: Okay.
01:38:35.650 - 01:38:38.414, Speaker C: I live in New York City, and I do not have a doorman.
01:38:38.542 - 01:38:39.378, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
01:38:39.464 - 01:38:41.214, Speaker B: That's because you work for the Ethereum foundation.
01:38:41.262 - 01:38:59.340, Speaker A: You got to go to the protocol and tell them to give you some more money. Mike, the idea is, if you don't do this, it's not going to be the end of the world, but you're not going to get favorable treatment in the future. They're not going to help you carry your bag upstairs if your arm is broken or something.
01:38:59.790 - 01:39:19.920, Speaker B: Yeah, but Max. Okay, I've heard a lot of discussions about this premise. There's a bunch of different implementations. Right. But even if you were to say, okay, 1% of the burn should go toward maintaining the open source public good that is ethereum, we're back into political games as to how that's divvied up.
01:39:21.090 - 01:39:22.750, Speaker C: Attribution is insane.
01:39:23.090 - 01:39:57.450, Speaker B: Right? That's a nontrivial amount of money, probably. I don't know the specifics, but regardless if that is the source of funding, I mean, it's not like you're not playing similar political games there. In a sense, maybe it's a bit of a stretch, but that kind of turns theorem into a little bit of dow on chain governance. I mean, that's not exactly the way to say it, but you see where I'm going with that. We're trending. Yeah, go ahead. You're looking like maybe sort of like it's sort of between a rock and a hard place, which I think is reasonable.
01:39:58.030 - 01:40:52.874, Speaker A: Well, I think there's political games with how to divide up this protocol guild stuff. And it also happens to have this aspect of charitable donations and aligning people with apps and not with the protocol, so that they may make decisions that are better for the apps than the protocol. I don't know. I think it's part of a broader problem that I would say if you join a venture firm, you have very strict requirements on what you're allowed to do with your other investments. So you're basically only allowed to have Carrie in the firm and hold the SP and stuff like this. Right. You're not allowed to go and be angel investor in a bunch of other stuff, whether that's stuff that's not in the portfolio or stuff that has nothing to do with your area.
01:40:52.874 - 01:41:24.630, Speaker A: It's like you really have a lot of severe restrictions, and that's just for a venture firm, because they want to align the interests of the staff with the returns of the venture portfolio. And I think we should consider having a similar thing for people who are receiving public goods funding to work on the protocol, but they're also not getting a bunch of financial compensation from other stuff that may affect their decisions about the protocol.
01:41:27.210 - 01:41:46.730, Speaker B: What do you. I guess. I guess Mike is probably going to take slight objection to comparing Ethereum to a big venture capital firm, but go ahead, Mike, what are your thoughts?
01:41:46.890 - 01:42:58.054, Speaker C: Well, yeah, definitely agree with that sentiment. I guess anything like this does make it feel a little bit more like a corporate structure. And also, I guess anything that touches ether, the asset, feels like inherently super risky. Just in terms of like you're just taking this token and giving it to your friends, and then your friends are like there's all this insider trading, blah blah blah. And also if the protocol guild, the way the protocol guild in terms of membership works now, it's kind of like there's this nomination process and you vote on if someone's in and they can have partial weight, like half allocation or they can have full allocation. All of these things start, if you start adding ether, the asset, from the core protocol, into it, it just feels like so much insider trading, backroom dealing that I just think it's non starter, like completely dead on arrival. Honestly, in terms of how do you actually credibly fund public goods? I think that's what all these experiments are trying to figure out.
01:42:58.054 - 01:43:34.740, Speaker C: Optimism is doing the retroactive thing, which maybe that's in terms of aligning people's actions with what's good for the protocol, could be considered more better because if you make decisions about theorem protocol that end up helping something, you get rewarded for it after but not before, then maybe that path dependency is better. But yeah, I don't think there's a cut and dry answer to how to fund these things or how to keep people contributing to the open.
01:43:35.270 - 01:43:42.770, Speaker A: Alec should pay because he's a billionaire and he should use his funds to pay for the protocol yield.
01:43:43.190 - 01:44:26.594, Speaker B: I think it's interesting because as Mike was referring to, there are private companies, right, that help maintain Linux or some other open source software because it is useful for their. And that's sort of part of the problem. I would say. Ideally we'd have all these apps and they have developers that help. Like I'm using Uniswap here, not for any specific reason, but Uniswap helps in some capacity maintain the Ethereum protocol because that is where it's like they're building cars, right? They build cars and so they help finance the highways because they will sell more cars as a result of that. They need.
01:44:26.792 - 01:44:31.170, Speaker C: This is already happening, though. This is happening, right? Like paradise has rats.
01:44:31.590 - 01:44:32.340, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:44:32.790 - 01:44:38.594, Speaker C: Off chain labs, the company that runs arbitram, acquired. Yeah, this is definitely happening.
01:44:38.632 - 01:44:39.640, Speaker B: Okay, well.
01:44:40.170 - 01:44:57.114, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Okay. That is so fucking fake, by the way. I'm so mad about this. Somebody posted a fake benchmark of Besu, and then everybody's trolling Bessu when it's literally the same performance of geth, and somebody just posted a fake benchmark. Like, we just ran the benchmark. Like, not bad.
01:44:57.114 - 01:45:18.180, Speaker A: It's like within 1% the performance of Geth, and somebody posted a fake benchmark, and now everybody's trolling bessie, but nobody in consensus on Twitter. But I will say this. We do not agree with that benchmark, because if you actually run the benchmark and don't fake the results, then it's completely different than that result. Okay.
01:45:18.550 - 01:45:24.610, Speaker C: I think those results got taken, withdrawn. And in the all core devs, they talked about how those weren't.
01:45:26.870 - 01:45:33.750, Speaker A: On Twitter. Everybody still thinks Besu is not great when it's, like, literally the same performance as gath.
01:45:35.290 - 01:45:59.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I think wrath is a good example to me. Rath is a good example of a private company taking Georgios and making him write an entire Ethereum client. But in. All right, like, that would be an example. Some of the other examples of public goods mean. Come on. It's pretty absurd sometimes, let's be honest.
01:45:59.982 - 01:46:23.606, Speaker B: But we don't have to get too much into that right now. Okay. This has been fantastic. We have to end with probably the most pressing question, or the most interesting question. What do you think Ethereum alignment means? And how important is it? And what did you see come of that discussion? Debate? I don't know.
01:46:23.708 - 01:47:01.422, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it basically started with l two s that pay rent to the l one for a shitty da layer. But the DA layer has uses, it has users. So they pay rent in the form of $50,000 a day of gas fees to use this da layer, which they don't actually need to use because they could use another one that works better, and then they get users because they're like an l two. Right. But really, I think they're basically their own chain for the most part, with a little more security guarantees, and they're paying rent on the main chain to get users.
01:47:01.566 - 01:47:02.290, Speaker B: Mike?
01:47:03.030 - 01:47:51.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I don't want Ethereum alignment to be a crutch. That is just a social tool to get people to use Ethereum. You know what I mean? I don't think it's a very good outcome if we're depending on the social layer super heavily to incentivize people to use Ethereum. It should provide a service. It should be like the best block space, the most credibly neutral, decentralized, censorship resistant block space. And I think the crypto ecosystem is big enough to have other block space sets for sale. And yeah, I guess I'm not too worried about everyone being maximally Ethereum aligned insofar as it doesn't become like an us versus them.
01:47:51.954 - 01:48:26.640, Speaker C: I feel like there's way too much PvP knowledge or PvP mindset and eating a larger portion of my pie rather than growing the pie for everyone. I don't know. It just feels like if crypto is as important as we think it could be, then fighting over the scraps of what exists right now in terms of market share and users and apps and stuff just isn't that productive. And just building for a better version of the crypto future doesn't have to be Ethereum aligned to be the only way to do it. You know what I mean?
01:48:27.170 - 01:48:28.730, Speaker B: Were you annoyed by the alignment?
01:48:28.810 - 01:48:52.562, Speaker C: Anons, I thought they were funny. I mean, you inspired a lot of them, right? Like it was all your tweets about burning the $100 bill in front of the homeless guy instead of giving it to him. But I think for the most part now, it just doesn't feel that relevant to the discourse.
01:48:52.626 - 01:49:08.582, Speaker B: No, I agree. The only thing matters is if you post your data to the Ethereum. L one, you can't post Celestia. That's the only alignment thing at this point. If you post it to Celestia, it's very unaligned. Apart from that, think you're good to go.
01:49:08.716 - 01:49:10.590, Speaker C: Yeah, we should probably cut it here, right?
01:49:10.660 - 01:49:20.960, Speaker B: All right. I really appreciate it. It was super fun. Thanks for coming along. We're going to have you guys back too, for sure. I say we. I will have you back on the podcast for sure.
01:49:20.960 - 01:49:23.370, Speaker B: Yay.
