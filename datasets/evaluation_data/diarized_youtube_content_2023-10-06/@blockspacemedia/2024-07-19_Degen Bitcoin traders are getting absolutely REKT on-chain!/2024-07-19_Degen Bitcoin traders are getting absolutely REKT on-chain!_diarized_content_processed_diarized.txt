00:00:00.280 - 00:00:25.838, Speaker A: I wrote a very interesting piece on the landscape of leverage in the ordinals and runes ecosystem. Yes. If you're listening to this, you can take your jpeg and loan against it. And many people have, and we've, we got to look at exactly how many people had defaulted. So over $100 million in loans against these assets, of which 20 million plus have defaulted. That's the, that's the damage so far.
00:00:25.974 - 00:00:52.230, Speaker B: It's a race for the most degenerate collection. That's what I'm taking away from this. And you so casually mentioned how 20% of the debt taken out on these jpegs has been liquidated. We should do a segment within ordinal's corner called Degen's playing with debt, and we just go through all of the leverage and deleveraging that happens.
