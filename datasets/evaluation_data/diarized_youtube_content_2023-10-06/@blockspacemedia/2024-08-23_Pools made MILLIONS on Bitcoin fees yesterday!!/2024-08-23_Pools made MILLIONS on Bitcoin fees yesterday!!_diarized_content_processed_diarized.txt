00:00:00.160 - 00:00:10.849, Speaker A: Well this morning fees pumped really, really hard. We saw a bitcoin block with 15 bitcoin reward in it and then a bunch of bitcoin blocks with like 9, 6, 5 Bitcoin rewards in there. So.
00:00:10.937 - 00:00:24.201, Speaker B: So now in phase one, Bitcoin holders can stake bitcoin onto the protocol. And after we accumulate a sufficient level of stake then in phase two we will now launch a few chains starting with the Babylon chain.
00:00:24.313 - 00:00:55.685, Speaker A: It's basically a network that allows proof of stake networks to tie their security to the bitcoin chain. And what does this mean practically for miners? Well, you don't really have to care about Babylon at all but you should be aware of these meta protocols that are exogenous to bitcoin because they're going to impact your revenue. For bitcoin mining, one block had almost a million dollars in total rewards. Go check out Bitcoin Season 2. We dropped an exclusive interview with David say, the founder of that which we recorded live in bitcoin Nashville.
