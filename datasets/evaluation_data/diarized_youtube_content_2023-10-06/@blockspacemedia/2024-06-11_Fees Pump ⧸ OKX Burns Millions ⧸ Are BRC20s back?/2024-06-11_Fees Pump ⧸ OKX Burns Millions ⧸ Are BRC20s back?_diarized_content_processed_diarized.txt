00:01:35.964 - 00:02:29.188, Speaker A: Welcome back to the bitcoin season two weekly livestream. This is me, Charlie under blockspace Media doing a bitcoin season two live stream about midday every Monday. This is a metrics heavy episode, live streamed video on YouTube and X, pulling out a lot of charts, a lot of metrics, and some news and some forward looking indicators. This is where I pull out the charts and we see who's winning, who's losing, what bitcoin looks like. Make sure to check out the other block space media, podcasts and content, our newsletter on blockspace media as well as the Gorge show and mining pod. The bitcoin season two podcast does a Monday, which is today livestream, and a Thursday release of more in depth interviews. So today we have always interesting things happening on bitcoin.
00:02:29.188 - 00:03:20.100, Speaker A: We're going to talk about the OKX funny little consolidation issue, and bitcoin fees are pumping because of that. And then also I think another narrative that I'm going to inject in here is that BRC twenties may get a little bit of a return. Without further ado, I'm going to launch into the metrics. Let's start with bitcoin. So, mempool space, we see the current fee rate on bitcoin is a little bit higher than it was last week. We're in the high twenties, but if you look at it, you actually see over here on the right if you're listening to this, I'm looking at the mempool space chart of the depth of transactions on the average mempool. We see a huge spike here.
00:03:20.100 - 00:03:38.156, Speaker A: This is this past weekend. We'll talk about this. This was OKX kind of tripping over themselves. Consolidating Utxos. What are consolidating Utxos? Well, you have to read our newsletter. I'll also review it here. Let's also take a look at Merch's dune dashboard.
00:03:38.156 - 00:04:41.098, Speaker A: Just what kind of transactions are happening on bitcoin? Well, we see with this chart regular transactions versus BRC 20 versus other types of transactions. Since April 20, since the having the majority of transactions by number have been runes, we're talking 70, 60, sometimes 80% of the transactions by type on bitcoin are runes transactions. You know, if you watch previous streams, the uh, the number of rune like the runes market is kind of up and down, but has been recovering a bit that we had a bit of a pump last week and it's pulled back a bit. But um, we saw a bit of return of BR 220 transactions. Why? Well, we'll get into that. Um, and then the other, uh, chart here that I think is really important is just, um. Uh, just the regular, uh, just the fees dedicated to all these transactions.
00:04:41.098 - 00:05:29.178, Speaker A: So, um, again, I pulled up a chart which shows just the fees by transaction type. And fees are down comparatively, you know, since the. The big rush over the last winter and the. The pump over the halving. But we have seen a little bit of a fee recovery where we're getting anywhere from 40 to 50 bitcoin and fees per day across the board, from regular financial transactions to runes to BRC 20 to other types of inscriptions. Another metric, and I don't see any other, like, bitcoin podcasts really covering this, is looking at the amount of TvL total value locked on what we might call bitcoin l two s. Now, these are the various types of scaling or bitcoin abstractions.
00:05:29.178 - 00:06:09.524, Speaker A: I won't get into what makes an l two, but I love the bitcoinlayers.org dot. But let's look at the metrics. So we have Bob here from Interlay partnered with marathon Digital to merge mine this chain. Bob has a majority wrapped bitcoin, some deposits on sovereign and TBTC $300 million TVL, which is pretty significant. That's a lot of economic weight on that chain. We see daily deposits going into Bob have plateaued over the past month, but they've been pretty consistent since the end of March.
00:06:09.524 - 00:07:10.718, Speaker A: Moving over to mezzo from thesis, we see about $126 million Tvl, again into the nine figures, 1100 wrapped bitcoin equivalent, and 6600 addresses. We see another similar chart with mezzo here, where we had a large entrance of depositors in late March and early April as thesis promoted the meso L two. And we've seen a bit of a plateau over the past month of depositors. Again, this, you know, I don't believe withdrawal is yet available for this l two, but they do promote a yield bearing mechanism on chain. Very interesting to watch this. And then the other kind of third major, I'm going to call it an l two. Here again is Merlin.
00:07:10.718 - 00:07:58.728, Speaker A: This is largely popular in Asia, with a whopping $1.5 billion in TvL staked on this chain. You've heard me talk about personally on my own platforms and on some block space pods, but I would be cautious, as the exit of this l two seems a little under question. But $1.5 billion is 22,000 bitcoins staked on this. And they have a staked ETH equivalent called stone 100,000 staked ETH, according to their own metrics. So look at this chart here where we get to see the bitcoin staked on Merlin chain since February of 24.
00:07:58.728 - 00:08:32.464, Speaker A: We saw massive depositors throughout February and March. The great Merlin unstaking just after the having in April. And then it's been mostly plateaued since then. We saw a little bit of an increase in depositors onto this l two in the first week of June. Let's move on to ordinals. My favorite chart from my favorite Dune dashboard from data always on Dune. 67 million inscriptions, the majority of which are BRC 20.
00:08:32.464 - 00:09:09.384, Speaker A: But I'm going to zoom out in a second here. So we have here a chart showing the number of inscriptions happening per day. This includes jpegs, but also BRC twenties. And we saw inscriptions pretty much drop off a cliff and go to near zero comparatively right after the having as runes capture the narrative. Well, over the past couple of weeks, really the past week, we've seen a bit of a return inscription activity. This is almost exclusively driven by BRC Twenties from Unisat. I will talk about this again in a moment.
00:09:09.384 - 00:09:43.024, Speaker A: So we are seeing inscription activity return again. It's mostly the JSON type five ticker pizza mint from an airdrop from Unisat. Let's see the other charts on here. I will probably skip those. I'm just going to go straight to the marketplace dashboard from Domo. $4.1 million in aggregate marketplace volume to date across all major marketplaces as tracked by Domo's dashboard.
00:09:43.024 - 00:10:54.616, Speaker A: We see volume by Marketplace having returned a bit over the past month. As you know, the runes recover. And as I said, as I mentioned, kind of a BRC 20 resurgence. I think one of the things I want to point out here, and I'll talk about this a bit, is kind of the marketplace, the marketplace wars or marketplace competition. You have Unisat OKX and Magic Eden as these three kind of tightness dominant marketplaces. And they do vie for competition and they kind of eat into each other's market share, but it has this kind of cadence and rhythm to it, which is kind of dependent upon what the hot type of thing to mint is on bitcoin. So we saw here, you see this line, this is 607, this is Friday of this past week where we had a massive pump in marketplace transactions which corresponded to an increase in marketplace volume.
00:10:54.616 - 00:11:48.512, Speaker A: But you might notice, and it's hard to see on this chart here, the majority of this volume happened on Unisat. Unisat has been losing market share by both transaction activity and by volume over the past couple months. But when Unisat did their giant pizza airdrop, this generated a lot of new interest and demand for their marketplace as its BRC 20 heavy. This is interesting to watch. Last week this stream I was talking about how Magic Eden had been dumb, had been increasingly their market share had been increasing, really eating into OKX and Unisat's market share. But we saw a couple days where Unisat did burst back on the scene this past week as they dropped their distributed their pizza token. User growth on all these exchanges marketplaces has begun to creep up a bit again.
00:11:48.512 - 00:12:19.184, Speaker A: This chart says shows unique users by marketplace. It's really tracking unique wallets, but I think this does mitigate a bit of the dual wallet count. But we saw user growth plateau to a few thousand new users per day. But it seems to be ticking up again. I don't want to read too much into this little tick here over the past three or four days, but it does seem to be returning. We'll see how this goes. Let's move on to runes.
00:12:19.184 - 00:12:58.924, Speaker A: So runes going to the genie data dashboard runes market overall market cap peaked this time last week at about $2.2 billion and has declined a bit. The mania did have to take a breather. We're now at about $1.8 billion for this overall market cap. Of all fungible tokens of the runes type, this little graphic here, this fun icon from Genie data shows Casey's health, referring to a joke that he made that he would commit seppuku if runes did not have a billion dollars in overall market cap. Well, Casey is safe.
00:12:58.924 - 00:13:31.714, Speaker A: He is about 80% over the safe line as runes are at about $1.8 billion into a market cap. I'm heading this dashboard a lot until I find a better one. This is from poshy on Genie data. 24 hours volume on runes roughly 6,015,000 unique sales and we see the daily volume trends on runes here declining a bit over the past couple of days. This is a chart I tweeted out just a moment ago which shows daily exchange volume percentage. I think this is really interesting.
00:13:31.714 - 00:14:31.002, Speaker A: So discounting that event with Unisat, we see that Magic Eden is pretty close to becoming the super majority of transactions for runes by volume. Magic in is currently doing about 60% of the volume for runes, with OKX doing about 30%, Unisat with about 6%. This is now kind of looking almost like a duopoly across the marketplace space for runes. Magic Eden had not really found market fit or market traction for fungible tokens as they'd been mainly like a JPEG marketplace over the past year. But as they were able to be first on the scene with runes right at the halving, they certainly have seen a lot of market share, increased market share. So be interesting to see how this story develops. Again, look at this past 24 hours exchange volume distribution.
00:14:31.002 - 00:15:00.012, Speaker A: This top bar is Magic Eden. $3.6 million OKX with less than half that at $1.7 million and unicycled half a million, the top 24 hours price gainers. I don't know if I'm going to spend too much time on this. I don't know if I want to make this like a ticker price show, but it's some, you know, random animal themed tickers and we have. Yeah, that's probably all I will spend on that.
00:15:00.012 - 00:15:53.198, Speaker A: Let's go into the news. The news this week, and I wrote about this in the in the Block Space newsletter that came out this morning, is that you saw, as I said, a fee spike here this past weekend, which was from, again, that exchange, OKX consolidating Utxo's. What does that mean? Well, I go into detail about what that actually means in our newsletter, but I'll summarize it here. Basically, as people deposit to an exchange, the bitcoin they deposit is in the form of outputs. So they'll send bitcoin to an exchange, and then that exchange has to manage the outputs that are pointed to them. We call those unspent transaction outputs, or utxos. So on all these Utxos you want to manage having how many of those you own.
00:15:53.198 - 00:16:55.634, Speaker A: So you want to typically reduce or consolidate those. So these exchanges will have to create transactions to take, say, 100,000 utxos down to, say, 10,000. This is just good practice and reduces future fees. Well, OKX did a very not optimized Utxo consolidation this weekend where they basically would send out in batches where they'd have one batch estimate the new average fee to get into a block. This created a phenomenon where Okex was effectively bidding against their own batched transactions and single handedly ramping up the fees. This resulted in millions of dollars unnecessarily spent by OKX in order to consolidate their utxos. If they'd been just a little more patient or just a little more optimized, they would not have to spend what looks like to be about $17 million overall to consolidate these Utxos over the weekend.
00:16:55.634 - 00:17:53.464, Speaker A: So there's a great thread on this by or data from this past week. I would recommend reading this if you're more of an ordinals folks, ordinals person to kind of understand how this works. And then I would also recommend reading a couple threads by Mononaut, who is one of the folks running mempool space. So yeah, the final results for this is that it was about 2385 transactions with about 357,000 inputs. They had an average fee rate of 246 sats per v byte and cost 254 bitcoin in total fees that could have been reduced significantly. So on this topic, I wrote a blog. Make sure you hit up blockspace media, read the latest blog, subscribe to the newsletter called nobody is ready for high fees.
00:17:53.464 - 00:19:05.924, Speaker A: And my point is, is that when you have these tier one exchanges doing these kind of Utxo consolidation flubs, and this is, you know, they can stomach that, they can stomach that loss. Like, that's expensive, but like, they have large treasuries and this gets into kind of R and D budgets. But like, their, their challenge and their lack of optimization for Utxo consolidation extends down to the bitcoin user base. So if you've been degenerating VRC 20s or if you've been DCA ing bitcoin, you could have similar, you could face similar issues in the future. So I make this point in this newsletter where I kind of point out that this is, this could be a looming problem for the bitcoin ecosystem as very, I think this is kind of a technical issue which has to be solved that the user like the UX side. So this could mean that people who think they have a lot of bitcoin may actually not be able to access that bitcoin without spending a lot in fees. So this is, I think, very important to keep your eye out for.
00:19:05.924 - 00:20:24.504, Speaker A: And I'll be talking a lot about this on my personal Twitter and platforms, as well as on block space channels. So the other kind of news, again, I'm going to go back to the Block Space newsletter from last Friday, is that, you know, this Opcat thing that the taproot wizards are pushing that the quantum Cats Ordinals collection promotes is an opcode and soft fork onto bitcoin Opcat. You know, this seemed like a fringe thing about six months ago in the latest newsletter, I kind of break down both a timeline and a TLDR of where we are that the bip for Opcat was really only introduced in late fall of last year, and it seemed like a fringe thing. But in just a matter of six months, this Opcat topic has become pretty mainstream. In fact, it's found wide support, broad support among a lot of people who I think were not talking about it nine months ago. From Adam back to Starkware, it's live on bitcoin signet. You have some other people who are, I would say they're pragmatists and they're conceding some grounds on Opcat.
00:20:24.504 - 00:21:24.934, Speaker A: I use the example of Shinobi as he is a critic of Opcat, but he's a pro covenant and a pragmatist. So you see like this, you see like people generally fall on the side of pro soft forking bitcoin. In the interest of solving what some people anticipate are some issues for scaling and Utxo ownership, let's look forwards. Coming up next, we have inscribing Nashville, which is the kickoff conference to the bigger bitcoin Nashville. In July. Blockspace will be at inscribing Nashville enforce. In fact, we'll actually have a whole kind of broadcast component to this inscribing Nashville conference, where we will be doing interviews and in depth content with the headliner speakers of the conference of inscribing Nashville.
00:21:24.934 - 00:22:04.794, Speaker A: So keep your eyes peeled. We'll be dropping some discount codes and we will be promoting and kind of teasing what we're doing with this. Speaking of teas, what we're doing with this, if you like and subscribe to Blackspace Media and wherever you stream or YouTube, Spotify, Apple, whatever RSS feed. On Thursday, I have an interview coming out with Leonidas. Yes, we're talking meme coins, specifically doggo to moon what could be the first billion dollar meme coin on bitcoin. So I had a great conversation with them that's dropping later this week. Make sure to like and subscribe and you know, notification bell.
00:22:04.794 - 00:23:23.814, Speaker A: So without further ado, that is the bitcoin season two weekly update. Make sure to turn on notifications, hit the subscription button at the various platforms, and I will see you on various blockspace media content platforms. Thanks so much. Oh, it's.
