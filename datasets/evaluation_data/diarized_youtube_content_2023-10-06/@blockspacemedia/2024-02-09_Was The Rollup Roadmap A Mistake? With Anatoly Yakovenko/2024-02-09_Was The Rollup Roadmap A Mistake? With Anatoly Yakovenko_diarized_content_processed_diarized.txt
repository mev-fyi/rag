00:00:03.370 - 00:00:16.526, Speaker A: I'm here today with Anatolia Yakovanko, who's agreed to come on and talk about bunker coin. Anatoly, do you want to introduce yourself quickly? I think most people probably know who you are.
00:00:16.628 - 00:00:25.990, Speaker B: Good to be here. So I'm Anatoli. I'm co founder of Solana Labs. Engineer by trade. You know, Solana is kind of my baby. Me. Awesome.
00:00:26.060 - 00:00:36.710, Speaker A: Thanks for coming on. First thing I wanted to ask you quickly is if I called you right now, would you answer on a saga phone or would you answer on an iPhone?
00:00:37.130 - 00:01:04.194, Speaker B: I have a number on both, so depending which number you use, I would answer on that one. So I use both. I got like, the saga I use for nfts. The iPhone is better hooked up with all the security stuff at work, with accounts and stuff like that. It's just like, Android isn't as good these days like that, so I got to use both.
00:01:04.312 - 00:01:28.042, Speaker A: Okay, well, actually that's encouraging. You've been extremely bullish on the saga fund recently on Twitter, so that's exciting. I'm glad to hear you're using it in tandem. Okay, well, I think that we should talk about stuff that you don't usually get asked about. So let's dig in. Okay. I want to ask you first and foremost, just get right into it.
00:01:28.042 - 00:01:33.370, Speaker A: Do you think that the roll up centric roadmap was a mistake for Ethereum?
00:01:35.950 - 00:02:25.542, Speaker B: They have like a. I don't know, what is it today, 300 billion dollar ship that they have to steer right and slowly make changes that slowly improve the network without ruining what they have and without causing a catastrophic bug. I would not want to be in their shoes. Or like Peter, who's like the death maintainer Peter? My God, man, that's got to be the most stressful open source maintainer job in the world. Like, you accidentally merge a change that has a catastrophic safety bug. Ethereum has some integer overflow bug causes more eth to be created. It sucks like fuck.
00:02:25.542 - 00:03:10.442, Speaker B: I would not want to have that job ever. So the changes that they add and slowly kind of move are happening. I think the roll up thing is like a pretty decent in between. I don't know what the final state of Ethereum is going to look like, even if they want to do this kind of big roll up centric thing. Just the user experiences are not great. The value capture, I think all happens in the execution layer. Stuff like this, I think is going to start probably causing people to think about can they do a hybrid approach where there's some stuff happening in the layer one alongside with the roll ups, and we'll kind of see it sucks to be them.
00:03:10.442 - 00:03:50.902, Speaker B: It's also great to be them. Right. If Solana is as successful as, like, I'm also going to be super freaked out about every change that goes into the protocol. But hopefully at that point, we have better client diversity. I think in a lot of ways, Solana is blessed to have Ethereum, have to deal with all these things in a much safer and longer way, and we get to be the underdog and an outage, right? Salana outage happened, nobody, like, it was okay. Life moved on. The world didn't stop.
00:03:50.902 - 00:04:10.026, Speaker B: Right? I think if an ethereum outage happened, it would be, like, catastrophe for the whole space. Knock on wood. We don't see any more Solana outages, but it's just they're in a different spot altogether in terms of adoption and maturity and the eyes and the pressure and everything.
00:04:10.208 - 00:04:18.298, Speaker A: Okay, we're going to come back to that more. We're going to harp on that more. But there's been this big discussion recently about client diversity.
00:04:18.474 - 00:05:05.786, Speaker B: The problem with it is, well, you need it. Why is fire dancer being built is because if you remember back in the day, bitcoin had a bug where integer overflow created, like, infinite bitcoins. So a bug like that is catastrophic. It's really catastrophic to the network, because if attacker executes it, they could break all the defi, just totally fuck everything up. So you need multiple implementations. So the probability of that same bug existing in two different implementations is pretty low, virtually zero. So as soon as fire dancer is out, I'm going to be pushing for 50%, or over 33% of nodes running fire dancer.
00:05:05.786 - 00:05:43.146, Speaker B: And the problem there is that if two different clients, written by two different teams from a very complicated spec, are going to have impedance mismatches, stuff is not going to work perfectly, and that could lead to a liveness failure. An outage, or at least part of the network dies. The other one's still making blocks, but there's no finality or confirmation. And in Ethereum, in that state, you actually get slashed. If you have a client that is down on Solana, you don't get slashed. My view is that safety is really paramount. That's the most important thing.
00:05:43.146 - 00:06:17.698, Speaker B: If there's an outage, it sucks. We fix the bugs, we try harder, we test more, we hopefully find all of them. But ideally, you have four clients evenly split. So when there is one of those impedance mismatches and one of the clients dies, the rest of the network continues and you fix that one and then you don't even have those kinds of interruptions. But the key part that's really important is that there's a safety bug, that the state diverges. The network actually does halt. That's a good outcome.
00:06:17.698 - 00:06:57.060, Speaker B: So what's weird about the liveness, whatever inactivity leak is, it actually discourages people from taking the risk of using another client because they don't want to be the ones that are being punished. So I think that an activity leak might be a bad incentive. The negative externalities of it are actually pretty bad. I don't think Solana would ever have it. And I think from kind of the community perspective, let's optimize safety and make sure that there's two clients. And if there's an outage because of that, so be it. But it's better to be safe than sorry.
00:06:57.670 - 00:07:02.046, Speaker A: Yeah. So what do you think? Bitcoin core is run by, I don't.
00:07:02.078 - 00:07:02.660, Speaker B: Know.
00:07:04.470 - 00:07:07.202, Speaker A: High 90% of nodes.
00:07:07.266 - 00:07:41.614, Speaker B: Bitcoin is really slow and that gives you some advantages and it's really simple. So in that bug, with whatever, the integer overflow bug in bitcoin, it wasn't an outage. They literally just fixed the bug and pointed it back to a block that was like 5 hours ago and started building on that chain. Technically, nothing in bitcoin broke. It's part of the protocol to do that. And it's on you. If you accept a confirmation in six blocks instead of 8 hours.
00:07:41.614 - 00:08:29.386, Speaker B: And because it's so slow, you actually have time. So many people are watching it now. If there was a block produced now that caused an integer overflow, I think pagerduty across everywhere, finance, Coinbase everywhere would go off, right? And then everyone would be like, what the fuck happened? Let's go fix this as soon as possible. Don't accept any confirmations. And then that rollback wouldn't even impact anyone financially. But in a fast chain, especially like Solana or Ethereum, it's far more dangerous, actually. So in my view, it's kind of like as soon as you start shrinking block times, I don't think you can reasonably have a system that picks liveness over safety.
00:08:29.386 - 00:08:42.958, Speaker B: You have to be safety over liveness. You have to stop in case something looks like doesn't look right, and then figure it out, fix it, continue for all practical purposes.
00:08:43.134 - 00:09:25.070, Speaker A: So let me ask you this. Let's say that fired answer comes out, and I know there's been a lot of discussion about the specs, and honestly I'm not technical enough really to interpret what exactly that means. But there's people who are quite bullish on it. And I saw one of the fired answer devs recently sort of mention, actually, he said something along the lines of, like, you could effectively have a single client running, and then in the case of some critical bug, there's the ability to hot swap. Is this functionally true? Could you just swap in another client without any severe penalties for the chain?
00:09:25.410 - 00:09:58.522, Speaker B: The problem there is like detecting what is a bug and what isn't. How do you know? Right, like, that you've experienced a bug, there's some bugs, you can do that, like, your node falls behind, it can't process transactions. There's, like, resource issues, and then you have kind of standard primary to secondary failover. Like, you run both clients labs and fire dancer, and labs. One falls behind, we have a bug and some cache, and the resources get blown up, and it can't keep up. You fail over to fire dancer, you don't skip a beat. Everything's running.
00:09:58.522 - 00:10:54.318, Speaker B: But the safety bugs that you care about is if labs computes one set of state and fire dancer computes another one, they disagree on what the state of the chain is. That's when you need to halt, because you don't know which one is the right one, so you can't hotswap one or the other that we actually would rather prefer you halt both, I would hope. Once fire dancers out, all the top staking providers, top exchanges, the circles, the wormholes of the world, they run both clients. If they ever disagree, deposits stop for a while, right? Who cares? Right? Wormhole stops for a while, right? Circle stops for a while. None of that stuff is as important as if there's a critical safety bug. The network should stop. Engineers, go figure it out and fix it.
00:10:54.318 - 00:11:34.826, Speaker B: The problem there is that it's new code, right? It's complex. It's trying to implement the same spec that's really ill defined. And it's large, right? It's got a big surface area. So a bunch of little, small mistakes could cause it to diverge in a way that is different, because the computation is different, but it's meaningless. Like, the error code on some transaction is one on labs and two on fire dancer has no impact on finances of anyone. But that would cause the state to diverge, and then you have to figure it out. So there's hopefully, I imagine during the initial bootstrapping phase, when fire dancer is running with, like, 1% of the stake, you're going to see a bunch of those.
00:11:34.826 - 00:11:46.014, Speaker B: But at some point, they're going to happen once a week, then once a month, then once six months, but then not for a year. And you're like, okay, it's kind of ready.
00:11:46.132 - 00:12:42.894, Speaker A: What do you think? Okay. So I go back to ethereum for a second now with this recent. What was it? Was the bug in Besu or Nevermind, I forget. So one of these clients had a bug and there were some people on Twitter mainly saying that if Geth was to go down and there was severe penalties for stakers, that they should have to incur that. The reason that this is obviously somewhat of a contentious statement is because a large portion of the network runs on Geth. What do you think of this, fundamentally? I don't know, maybe ideologically? Is this like a stance? Because I see a lot of the more what I would consider to be sort of cipher punk versions of Ethereum, people saying, yeah, this is something that we have warned about and there's no bailout, but when there's this much of the network running on gat, it's kind of like, okay, I mean, cut off your nose. Despite your know, type thing.
00:12:42.894 - 00:12:46.178, Speaker A: I don't know, what are your thoughts on that? And then we kind of move on from this.
00:12:46.344 - 00:13:29.262, Speaker B: That's the fundamental defense that anyone has against an attacker. If on Solana, somebody corrupted the quorum and created two headers that double signed and committed to state roots, all the honest nodes would halt because they would see this inconsistency and we'd be like, okay, a bunch of machines halted. What the f. The network's running, but none of the machines that we're trying to boot up are connecting. The quorum is corrupted. It means it's been taken over by an attacker. Theoretically, the only defense that we have, right, is that we boot up another quorum and we slash the previous one so they can't economically go recreate the attack.
00:13:29.262 - 00:14:11.178, Speaker B: So it costs them a lot to go do it again. That's the only defense that you have that's the right thing to do. The question is, did this happen because of a bug and it's the fault of the developers or is it really an economic attack? Right. And this is where the social consensus and all this stuff plays out. And I don't think the incentives, the inactivity leak capture those. It's obvious that what's happening in Ethereum is that it actually is incentivizing everyone to go with the herd and stick with gath because they think that's the safest one. And if Besso or whatever has an outage, then they're paying the slashing penalty.
00:14:11.178 - 00:15:10.446, Speaker B: I think the way to apply this would be to actually not have an activity leak, but to have the slashing penalty be applied during the restart by hand through social consensus. And in that time you can identify, was this an attack? Was this really somebody that bought off all the stake and then double signed the header? Very unlikely. But that could have been the attack. Or was this really just a bug in the code? Which is the most likely outcome, not really the fault of anyone. I don't know. It's a really good question and really hard to answer because the engineers that are building these systems have this vision of, like, it's a system that is self repairing and running autonomously, and the incentives perfectly get everyone to do the right thing.
00:15:10.628 - 00:16:04.002, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, especially with at least the rationale that I saw, which I don't think it's illogical, it's that if we don't take a stand when something like this happens, if we don't take a stand, then where do we draw the line? And I mean, I kind of troll about this a lot, but I think it makes sense if we're going to promote client diversity, if we're going to take the stand that client diversity is like a critical feature of this network, then if one of the clients messes up, regardless of whether or not it's for an economic attack or for a bug in the code, if we're not going to deploy the deterrence mechanisms that we have, then what are we going to do going forward? So I don't know. It's kind of a codeless law question. It's also kind of like, oh, there's like a screw up in one of the smaller clients. Go ahead.
00:16:04.056 - 00:16:10.050, Speaker B: But the incentives right now are only the stick. There's no carrot for client.
00:16:12.310 - 00:16:35.180, Speaker A: I don't disagree. Yeah. Okay, well, that's interesting. I think that this kind of goes back to a lot of the original kind of ethos with Ethereum and the client diversity. And it's also something that, not that I would say, like, I had some strong belief on this as a bitcoiner, but it is interesting to see, just like bitcoin core is something that has just.
00:16:35.950 - 00:17:18.790, Speaker B: My view is that the strength of these systems comes from this assumption that a single node that has the right copy of the ledger can prove correctness and can recreate the whole network, even if all the other copies are corrupted. And it has nothing to do with liveness or inactivity. In fact, that's a state that's usually the network is dead and you only have one copy. And then somebody on the Internet says, no, guys, I got the ledger. It's not corrupted. Can verify all the signatures and we can continue. That's what makes these kind of really hard to kill viruses, right? You kill everything but one node and then it repopulates.
00:17:18.790 - 00:17:50.510, Speaker B: So you want to encourage that. You want to encourage as many individual systems with as big of an environment. And in my mind, that means that you take a hit on liveness. What if there's more outages? Is that that big of a deal? But you do have that everyone's running different clients. They're running them for that purpose, that if at least one of those will survive and one of those will be a copy, and that means maybe the system is not as stable as it would be if it was 80% gap.
00:17:50.670 - 00:18:29.840, Speaker A: Okay, I want to come back a little bit to the first question I asked, or. Yeah, I don't know if it's the first question, but like the modular roll up, centric roll, I want to ask you. There was obviously, maybe it's a bit trite at this point, but there was this ethereum alignment and yeah, obviously you're on Twitter, you see this. I want to ask you more specifically, first of all, generally, what did you think of this? But also, how much do you think Salana benefited from this?
00:18:31.170 - 00:19:11.306, Speaker B: The Ethereum roll up? Perfect. Don't worry about competitors with 100 roll ups. Worry about a competitor with only one roll up. I would say. I think what people need to realize is that data availability or the raw resource costs are a commodity and they're going to be priced like a commodity. Like if all you're selling is data, it's going to be priced at, because that's what I'm getting out of latitude. And maybe you could price it four times as much.
00:19:11.306 - 00:19:38.440, Speaker B: But if you go much more above that, somebody else will then build another network that is a data availability network and undercut you. And you can argue to your heart's content that doesn't inherit the security. But as we see in marketing, people call that Ethereum aligned roll up. Even if it settles on Eigen layer or Celestia or whatever. Nobody really cares about those things.
00:19:42.970 - 00:19:58.250, Speaker A: Look, I'm the first one to say that people generally don't care. Like functionally, users don't care so much about this. With that said, you've seen these discussions with Dankrad. I think you've perhaps opined it as well.
00:19:58.320 - 00:20:09.760, Speaker B: They don't care about this because there have been zero failures from data withholding. Throughout all of crypto history, in 15 years, there have been not a single attack where an attacker withheld data.
00:20:10.690 - 00:20:17.700, Speaker A: Okay, so would you consider you could have an Ethereum l two that does not post its data.
00:20:18.710 - 00:20:50.970, Speaker B: It'll market itself as an Ethereum l two, and it will be competing with. Yes, and it's going to be competing for fees from Ethereum users and it will be competing for Ethereum liquidity from all the l two s that do poster data and fraud proofs. So that environment is going to be cheaper, potentially faster. Might even give them like a bullshit fast confirmation. My sequencer got it. You're good to go. And it's competing with everything else in Ethereum.
00:20:50.970 - 00:21:50.670, Speaker B: And Ethereum will be maybe generating some fees from the blobs. But if those are priced at commodity storage, then you will have like the cost of those is going to either. They have to constrain the supply of blobs to be so low that it's somehow seen as premium data storage. And you can kind of use marketing to say, hey, we're using true Ethereum data storage and this is a true l two. And then you're fighting in marketing side with everyone else. But users are not going to see a perceptible difference because literally throughout all of crypto history, despite the nearly thousand tenderman chains with every possible fuck up under the sun, no, there's been not a single failure. That was like the majority of the quorum withheld the data and posted an invalid route.
00:21:50.670 - 00:21:52.560, Speaker B: It's never happened.
00:21:54.070 - 00:21:59.140, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so you've said that Salana could be an Ethereum l two.
00:22:00.630 - 00:22:02.930, Speaker B: That Ethereum could be a Salana l two.
00:22:03.000 - 00:22:26.874, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think people know that you're trolling mainly when you say this. It's a factual troll. But I know what you're doing. Right. You're attempting to trivialize the definition of an l two, which I think is reasonable at this point. We have these roll ups that are saying they're Ethereum aligned. Now, whatever that ends up being, long run, we're not sure yet.
00:22:26.874 - 00:22:48.014, Speaker A: But they do have some stated goals, I would say. Right. They use Ethereum for data availability. Okay, maybe not. But you can force exit, right? If the validator set is, you can leave whenever you want. Right. So these are like steady goals.
00:22:48.062 - 00:22:52.450, Speaker B: The data is not on Ethereum. The attacker could withhold data and then you can't exit.
00:22:55.370 - 00:23:00.040, Speaker A: Okay, I want to ask what is an example?
00:23:01.370 - 00:24:19.370, Speaker B: Okay, so the reason I'm trolling is that people have been really loose with the definition of a roll up and an l two to the point where I can make the argument that you can make Salana and Ethereum l two. And the only one that was able to actually give a really good response to that was what's his name? Torgal from scroll. But basically, imagine in the future, Ethereum magically has this infinite da layer. You take all of Solana blocks and you submit them to that da layer. So now Solana data is inside Ethereum, right? And then you post a Solana state route to Ethereum and a proof that the execution was correct or a timeout. And then that has a fault proof, just like arbitram run the exact same setup, right? Solana validators still run and encode their own transactions. So if I post a transaction to Ethereum that says I want to take my wrapped etH on Solana and now exit it, and the Solana validators don't include it, you can then eject the Solana validators as the quorum that decides the validity of the state route inside Ethereum and elect a new one that includes my exit transaction.
00:24:19.370 - 00:24:52.090, Speaker B: So if the Solana validator set does censorship, does the bad thing, censors Ethereum users who are trying to exit because they have all the data for all the blocks, they can actually eject the quorum, elect a new one, take over the route on Ethereum, and continue. And in that point, what Solana validators are doing is now disconnected from the state route on Ethereum. And you can kind of think of it as a fork. So now there's two svms. One is Solana classic. One is Solana Ethereum. And which one is Solana? Nobody knows.
00:24:52.090 - 00:26:04.194, Speaker B: And Trogle, to his credit, said that what matters is the actual consensus. It's like, what is the alignment of the team of everyone that decides what is the true one? If everybody in the world believes that the root on Ethereum is the true Solana, then it doesn't matter if know, replace now Solana with arbitram. If everyone in the world believes that the true state route for arbitram is the one on Ethereum, the sequencers for arbitram can't go like Yolo and be like, fuck it, we're censoring everyone. We're now running our own arbitram chain, right? So that social kind of glue is what decides what's an l two or not. Not the data availability, interestingly enough. And so you can then argue that all of these bs l two constructs are l two s in the sense that they're all saying that no matter what Ethereum does, if there is a hard fork or whatever, we're sticking with whatever the Ethereum state decides as the l two route, and Salana is not going to do that. Right.
00:26:04.194 - 00:26:09.406, Speaker B: Because people in this ecosystem are building their own thing. The validator stat actually matters.
00:26:09.518 - 00:26:48.046, Speaker A: Right. That was sort of what I was getting at initially was like with regards to, I was going to ask you what would be an example of why Salana might become an l two? Because the reason I see this, and maybe I'm missing the technical nuance here, but to me it's like Salana intends to be both an execution and settlement environment, right? It isn't a layer one blockchain, whereas these roll ups don't fully intend to do that, although we're both looking at the same roll ups and seeing that they are functionally their own blockchains as well. So I understand, but yeah, go ahead.
00:26:48.148 - 00:27:28.774, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically, implementation wise, there's no difference between Salana as an l two and Salana as not an l two as its own thing. So it's all community kind of actual. The social glue that's going to drive that. What would make Salana have a data validating bridge to Ethereum is basically the cost of that bridge being low enough to the point where somebody like wormhole feels like this would be competitive advantage for us to have this bridge. So they do the whole sync Solana blocks to Ethereum, post a state route, do that whole check, and then convince Ethereum users, hey, no matter what, even if Solana validators go f off, this bridge is safe. You will always be able to exit.
00:27:28.774 - 00:28:34.834, Speaker B: So you should go use it. So there's a advantage to go do that whole thing because you actually do improve the safety of the Ethereum users. But it's tricky because if you deposit eth through this bridge and now your eth is inside some defi position against Sol, and the hard fork happens where Solana goes one way, ethereum goes another, and now those two state routes are separated, what is the value of that sol in that position, in that bridged state? Yeah, it's going to be like chaos, right? And Togrel's argument is that if it was arbitram, because arbitrum is always aligned with ETH and Eth, and that you would have a lot less chaos in theory. So that's kind of like the big question. So from my point of view, yeah, you can build these bridges. Maybe they'll have a commercial advantage if they do, wormhole will build it. If not, then they'll just be using a multi sig and no one's going to care.
00:28:34.952 - 00:28:46.622, Speaker A: Okay, we're going to stay on l two s for a second. What do you think of shared sequencing, or sequencing in general on l two s? What is your general overview?
00:28:46.766 - 00:29:46.450, Speaker B: Yeah, they're trying to fix that. There's no atomic guarantees between all these environments. So then if you throw them all in a shared sequencer that executes stuff, and then that sequencer gives you finality guarantees, you can then settle stuff, and when it settles, you preserve those finality guarantees. But it's going to be like, unless that sequencer is basically Solana, it's going to be kind of a massively centralizing force. We'll have like one sequencer somewhere that's now in charge of sequencing a bunch of roll ups. And the only reliable way you can manage it in a censorship resistant way is if you prove that it's censoring, then you have run some auction to kick it off, and that's like you're censorship resistant. But in a couple of hours, you're starting to slowly slice off all the benefits of decentralization and cr to the point where you have like a stump that looks like tradfi.
00:29:46.610 - 00:30:44.214, Speaker A: Yeah, this is mainly my view as well. It's like if we continue to, and I'm not sure this is exactly the phrase, but I can't think of a better one right now, if we continue to fragment consensus further and further, then we have a smaller and smaller set of people who are ultimately making at least some of the decisions. Right. Like the sequencing aspect may not be the same as the validating aspect on all these l two s and whatnot, but we're certainly reducing that size. Right. And so I think this is where it's interesting, kind of maybe comparison with Salana is that there are people who would argue, and I don't think this is an illegitimate argument, there are people who argue that the number of people who can credibly sequence transactions on Solana is relatively finite right now. But we're now sort of at the same juncture.
00:30:44.214 - 00:31:07.890, Speaker A: And that's what I think I found interesting and why I have followed. Yeah, maybe Solana a bit more closely recently and just also noticed this. It's like, okay, but most of these sequencing, like, shared sequencing efforts, most of these are scaling with, effectively more blockchains. You know what I mean? We're adding more blockchains and we're reducing the number of people who are really participating.
00:31:10.150 - 00:31:26.754, Speaker B: The big problem is that you're not going to see a sequencer like people are building using Solana as the sequencer. That kind of makes sense because you're just leveraging the censorship resistance of the network. But it's going to be hard. Like, you basically have to rebuild Solana.
00:31:26.882 - 00:31:29.434, Speaker A: And it's a huge head start, right.
00:31:29.632 - 00:31:53.920, Speaker B: As a sequencer, to be competitive with it on that property, it's a big pain in the ass. The other thing is that the entry point to Salana is just hardware, right? It's somewhat expensive now, but it's literally four times cheaper now than when we started. It was like one $200 to run a validator, like four years ago. It's 350 now.
00:31:54.850 - 00:31:57.846, Speaker A: That's how much it costs to run a salana, to run a salon validator.
00:31:57.898 - 00:31:58.562, Speaker B: 50 a month.
00:31:58.616 - 00:31:59.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:59.192 - 00:32:30.490, Speaker B: From latitude or terra switch, you get a box with 32 cores, one gigabit Internet, go have a ball. So that price is probably going to be under 200 by next year. It's just organized sand. It gets cheaper and cheaper to be a sequencer that is handling more and more blockchains. Those are all business decisions between teams. And then there's auctions to elect him with dows of which l two. Dow allows which sequencer to sequence it.
00:32:30.490 - 00:32:48.222, Speaker B: It's not a permissionless environment in the sense that I just throw a box and I'm part of the network. It's a much more like. Looks like tradfi to me. I don't know. BD deals between dows controlling multi sigs, right, on all these bridges.
00:32:48.286 - 00:33:36.400, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think to theorem's credit, I don't think this is lost upon them, and I think you know that too. Now, whether or not some of these problems are rectifiable in the short to medium term, I'm not sure, or in the long term for that matter, but I think that the Ethereum community is generally aware of this stuff. But it's also not lost upon me that you kind of converge back on like, okay, so then why aren't we just using an execution and settlement layer that is already effectively sequencing transactions, you know what I mean? But I don't want to throw a dog in this fight, but I understand the rationale and I think it makes sense. Okay.
00:33:37.430 - 00:34:02.566, Speaker B: Technology always goes through modularizing everything and then vertically integrating everything. That's the super cycle. You have people that are always trying to split the system, and then people that are always trying to put it together and optimize it. It's part of life. I've always liked the splitting part. Sucks because you make something slower, you're making something faster.
00:34:02.758 - 00:34:29.634, Speaker A: Passionate about speed. Okay. I heard you say something interesting recently. I don't know if you said it or you tweeted it, but you were talking about your vision. And correct me if I'm wrong here, because I'm just kind of going off the cuff, but I think what you said was, like, your goal is to have tons of distributed data centers, and there may be value in colocating around these data centers at some point, like hotspots or something. Is this like, essentially what you said?
00:34:29.832 - 00:35:42.858, Speaker B: What I want to see is block producers. The kind of the end state for Solana is that we can run multiple concurrent block producers, and those should be instantiated near where there is client demand because we want to cut the latency from the user to that node. So there's kind of like that end state, but I don't know how to achieve it in an unbiased way without overalllocating. And by that, I mean let's like, Europe, South America, Asia, those are all, like, hotspots, so there's three of them. For random chance to land a block producer in each one of those, we probably need like, twice as many, like six concurrent ones. So that's one way to do it, right? Like, you just tune the system, optimize it, add more cores, do everything we can to where it can support six to eight concurrent block producers, and then those are randomly distributed because we want to be unbiased by stakeweight. And then hopefully all those land near the user, and most of the time they will, and then you cut latency, and that's how you kind of get to that effect.
00:35:42.858 - 00:35:53.550, Speaker B: The same effect where users are really close to a block producer, but it's not like colocation in the sense we want to put all the validators in one spot. That won't really help, right?
00:35:53.700 - 00:35:54.014, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:54.052 - 00:36:17.960, Speaker B: What you actually care about is the block producer being close to the user, not like the voting validators. That helps a bit, but as long as you're going to have them across continents anyways, as long as there's no supermajority on one continent, it doesn't help. You actually either need to put more than two thirds of them all in one spot, or you might as well optimize for the fact that you're not going to have that.
00:36:19.690 - 00:36:34.090, Speaker A: What do you think about how Ethereum has handled MeV accelerationism? Whatever you want to call it, whatever buzword you want to throw in. But what are your thoughts on at least the l one. Mev.
00:36:34.830 - 00:37:26.598, Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, execution layer, my view is that MeV is just both a bug and a feature. It's like one of the ways that the way I think of these black boxes economically is like there's real costs, like cost of the hardware, cost of the people to run the boxes, and there's real, like somebody then does real work and pays somebody inside the black box to include him in a transaction. And it doesn't matter if I take a sack of potatoes and give them to a validator as a bribe over a side channel and say, hey, I'm going to be submitting transactions, please include them. Here are all my potatoes. Because that's a gain that the validator has, and then they're incentivized to go sell your potatoes, go get more steak. So then they can get more potatoes, then get more steak.
00:37:26.598 - 00:38:34.046, Speaker B: It doesn't matter where that money comes from, whether it's Meb, whether it's some other side channel. So from my perspective, I'm more on the acceleration of scamp, but there is negative externalities to it, where users think that they're like, oh, I'm going to get market price on the straight, and they get horribly sandwiched. And to deal with those, it's going to be like holistic. You need flash bots or whatever that are not built by 100% malicious people that can build in those barriers. You need protocols that take into account the slippage and all those things they can do, spot orders. Jupiter DCA is an awesome feature that prevents 99% of the malicious kind of map that you see that could really wreck you. So stuff like this, you need a whole bunch of people that understand each part of the propagation and kind of stack where MeV can be extracted and try to do their best to make sure that the kind of negative externalities of it aren't there, but at the same time, there's positive effects.
00:38:34.046 - 00:38:39.700, Speaker B: Validators make more money when I pay them to order transactions in a specific way.
00:38:40.070 - 00:38:42.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that, okay.
00:38:45.130 - 00:39:26.782, Speaker B: From a very high level, what I want is maximizing mev competition. So if Mev is valuable, me as a validator, I should be bribing users. I should be telling users, send me all your transactions exclusively. I will order them and put them in blocks. And if you do that, I'll give you a rebate from all my mev. That should be kind of like the equilibrium, because then I'm getting all the user transactions the other block producers are not. Right? So I get monopoly over ordering over this particular set of events, I maximize mev, I give a rebate back to the users.
00:39:26.782 - 00:40:00.986, Speaker B: The users get the rebate, they send me more transactions. That's kind of the equilibrium state, and that works when the UX for that can be sustained. And for that to be a good ux, you need the block producers that are all collaborating in this rebate environment to be frequently scheduled. So the more block producers per second we can schedule, the more likely that users always have an option of jeto stake pool, Mev rebate optimizers versus marinade ones. Right. And I can pick the best one.
00:40:01.168 - 00:40:54.506, Speaker A: Yeah, I think competition is obviously the goal with this stuff, but at the same time, we've already seen, I think most people would say, pretty high economies of scale with block building. And I don't know exactly what your thoughts are regarding speed. I know this maybe sounds a bit tangential, but I've heard you and intuitively, but granted, this is not my domain. It sounds like the faster something goes, the less. But. Okay, so you laugh, but this is not a completely agreed upon point. I think Tarun wrote a paper that maybe said something to this extent, but I don't really want to chime in here, but what I will say is not such a.
00:40:54.506 - 00:41:12.322, Speaker A: Yeah, this is not such a popular stance. But the thing is, I don't know that this necessarily reduces the economies of scale, because these things can be so very profitable, as, you know, to build blocks consistently. Go ahead.
00:41:12.376 - 00:42:09.302, Speaker B: At the same volume of trading on Solana, there's like way less Meb than an ethereum, because it's faster. And the window, right, you get a bunch of sequence of transactions from users, they observe state, they submit transactions. So MEV happens when the state on chain starts to separate from the state in the real world, which includes exchanges, Dexes, and that current transaction pool. But the faster the blocks and the faster the confirmation, the faster the state on chain is reconciled with the rest of the world. So that window for extraction is shorter, and because it's shorter, there's less value to extract, because it's like you're trying to do a derivative approximation. If you take a sample very quickly, your approximation of the derivative is going to be much better to the real one than if you take a granular sample. Right.
00:42:09.436 - 00:43:02.422, Speaker A: Well, and also, you can see this when there's volatility on binance, this is when Beaver and Rsync are most likely to win blocks, right? Because they can bid higher during these periods of time when there is more of a diversion from the on chain world. Versus the off chain world. I'm not so yet sold, though. It seems logical that the faster it goes, the less mev is extracted. And honestly, there is some precedent for this in like, for that matter, when all of these HFT firms that are co located near these stock exchanges in York, like when they have to compete on speed, users actually get pretty good execution, like all things considered. I mean, tradfi gets better execution than defi most of the. I mean, that makes sense.
00:43:02.422 - 00:43:10.922, Speaker A: I don't know what the long term economies of scale look like for salana so much, but I think it's good they're competing on speed, maybe.
00:43:11.056 - 00:43:57.958, Speaker B: And our goal is to cut block times to like 120 milliseconds with multiple block producers around the world. So then the latency between what, the on chain state and the real world, like finance servers in Dubai. Right, whatever, right. That information cannot propagate around the world in 120 milliseconds. That's basically the limit. So the state on Salana is going to be as good as price discovery as the server at Binance, because some newsworthy event happens somewhere, it's still got to go speed of light through fiber all the way to Dubai, and at that same time, it's going to hit a local block producer, wherever that. Right.
00:43:57.958 - 00:44:16.382, Speaker B: And start propagating through Solana. So by the time that news wire hits a trader in binance and they're trying to make that trade, it's already been reflected on chain state of Solana. That means there's no arbitrage. Yeah, that's, that's the fundamental limit that we're trying to get to.
00:44:16.516 - 00:44:24.820, Speaker A: I think that Ethereum would say, and I think their goal is to push this to l two s, right.
00:44:25.430 - 00:44:27.890, Speaker B: Or to capture all of that in the burn.
00:44:28.950 - 00:45:14.294, Speaker A: Okay, yes, or that. Yes. But I think that they would say most Mev will ultimately be extracted on these execution layers, and that's when we can start tinkering with faster block times and sequencers and so on and so mean. That would be the plan. Which also brings up sort of an interesting question that I actually asked Eric Wall last week. And I wish I'd gotten more out of him when I asked him this. But if Ethereum's goal is really to be this settlement layer, what do you think about how expressive the l one is? This is something I've thought about, and it doesn't mean anything that I thought about it, but it's like, if it's just going to be this layer that accepts proofs.
00:45:14.294 - 00:45:35.750, Speaker A: Right, like from all these l two s and everything is really happening elsewhere. Do you think that Ethereum. I guess, one more tangible question. Should Ethereum be saying you should develop only on l two s? You should not be developing applications on the l one anymore. But also you can answer the whole question or give your thoughts.
00:45:36.090 - 00:45:46.250, Speaker B: So settlement is like the most boring part of finance, DCSS or whatever, right? Can you even name the two settlement companies that do stuff at finance?
00:45:46.590 - 00:45:49.900, Speaker A: No, I can't, but I probably would know them anyway. But go ahead.
00:45:50.430 - 00:45:57.760, Speaker B: They handle like 70 trillion worth of assets charged, like two bips or whatever. It's the most commoditized part.
00:45:58.690 - 00:46:16.790, Speaker A: Yeah, but. Okay, this isn't exactly what we mean when we say settlement, though, kind of. But if they ran guarantees of the distributed validator set, like, this is what is promoted as being the most decentralized settlement.
00:46:17.450 - 00:46:44.858, Speaker B: Security comes from your own full node and your own connections. So Circle doesn't give a fuck about the settlement guarantees of Salana because they run their own node. DCSS, or whatever that company is, could issue all of their $70 trillion worth of stocks on Salana by running a single secure full node without giving any fucks about settlement guarantees of the rest of the network.
00:46:44.954 - 00:46:53.582, Speaker A: This is kind of funny. I don't know if I've ever heard you say something like this. This is a bit edgy, because, well, I don't know. Edgy is the word.
00:46:53.636 - 00:47:20.250, Speaker B: I've said this all the time. Economic security is a stupid meme. It doesn't actually mean anything. You running your own full node is what's providing guarantees, security guarantees. And it's true. This is why Circle was able to issue dollars, billions of dollars, on Solana early on in Solana's life, right? And deal through all the outages and all that stuff. They weren't like, oh, my God, Solana's settlement guarantees are not good enough for circle.
00:47:20.250 - 00:47:56.114, Speaker B: They didn't care, right? Because they run their own full node. They have exact copies of the ledger with all the signatures of all the users. That's reconciled against their internal ledgers. Anytime somebody submits a transaction, they verify it. Then they do the wire. They don't care if what the rest of the network does. This is like the primary function of these systems is they can provide these one on us node, right? Is all it takes, those guarantees to the user that's running one on a snow.
00:47:56.114 - 00:48:13.290, Speaker B: So this is a stupid meme that people have caught on. I don't know why, but probably to keep meming Ethereum as the most secure block space or something. This is the best settlement guarantees. It's meaningless. It's like, utterly meaningless.
00:48:14.270 - 00:48:48.514, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm usually the one who's very critical here, and also, I do generally agree with you, but. Yeah, okay, all right, I'll concede. I've sort of thought this myself, but I also feel like that is such a massive part of the Ethereum narrative. Right. It's going to be the settlement for. Yeah, but this is also why.
00:48:48.514 - 00:48:49.526, Speaker A: Okay, so wait, let me, let me.
00:48:49.548 - 00:48:53.270, Speaker B: Just like Tenderman has as good a settlement guarantees as Ethereum.
00:48:53.690 - 00:49:19.662, Speaker A: Well, but this is also why I asked you about Salana being becoming an l two is because to me, functionally, it's like what settlement guarantees of Ethereum would somebody from Salana demand, you know what I mean? Like, oh, I want this to settle on Ethereum. It could be executed on Salana, but it needs to settle on Ethereum. I'm sitting here, I'm saying Salana also settles transactions. Do you know what I mean?
00:49:19.796 - 00:49:28.580, Speaker B: So these are guarantees for Ethereum holders that want to bridge stuff somewhere else. It's a guarantee that they can bridge things back.
00:49:29.190 - 00:49:31.538, Speaker A: Okay, but I thought you meant, like.
00:49:31.624 - 00:49:38.180, Speaker B: Okay, this is what an l two guarantees is that if I bridge into arbitram, I can get my stuff out.
00:49:38.630 - 00:49:43.494, Speaker A: Right? So wormhole could build, you know, how to actually do the code, which I don't think anybody actually does, but, yeah.
00:49:43.532 - 00:50:44.540, Speaker B: Do the forced exit. Right? So wormhole could build a bridge where users that Ethereum, users that deposit assets into wormhole can do a forced exit back through all the proofs and all that stuff. And if they feel like that's worth the cost of development cost and actual cost of syncing Solana data and Ethereum, FDA, they'll do it because it'll be ev. Positive for them, but if it's not, then they won't. And I don't think it matters to circle or anyone else or anyone like Blackrock, that if they issue, like, a trillion dollars worth of assets, engineering wise, there is no difference whether they do it in a tenderman chain on Solana, inside an arbitrum chain or whatever they call, like, it's all the same. You run your own node, right? You run your own node, you secure that node, you have guarantees of execution of that node. When you issue those assets, they float around there doesn't matter, right?
00:50:45.950 - 00:51:04.260, Speaker A: What is your vision for Solana users in terms of the degree to which they interact directly with the envision? You see mert talking about this a lot, right? This is validation versus verification. And I'm interested to hear your thoughts. What do you think? Were we all going to be running?
00:51:04.950 - 00:51:44.026, Speaker B: Was while I was at Qualcomm, I was, like, building cheesy trading algorithms with interactive brokers and forex.com and stuff, and built my own stupid neural networks and all this stuff. None of it worked. I never made any money. It's not very encouraging, but I did learn a lot. And what I learned was that when I thought I had signal, my data would arrive a little later from interactive brokers. So it would just throttle me, and my orders would take just a little longer to get to the exchange.
00:51:44.026 - 00:52:23.110, Speaker B: And I was always frustrated, like, fuck, this is bullshit. This stuff seems like an open and fair environment, but it's not. So part of this vision with Solana was that we optimize it, we build it. It's all moving as fast as physics allow, but what's cool is still, like, just a bunch of open source code. Any hobbyist can go take a box, connect it to a fiber network, and throw the code on there, and they have the exact same level playing field as jump or citadel as anyone in the world. They have the data arrive at the same time. They can submit orders in the same kind of prioritization that's transparent, and they can actually compete.
00:52:23.110 - 00:52:56.306, Speaker B: So that was kind of like this big part was making sure that the network has fair reads and fair writes globally synchronized state machine as fast as physics allow. That's the core part. The implementation details, whether it's using modular, whatever, I honestly don't care about. I have my opinions because I think I can build fast code. But if an engineer makes a strong argument that there's a better way, we would switch it out. We don't really care. Ultimately, it's whatever, the best design wins.
00:52:56.306 - 00:53:30.874, Speaker B: But the goal is to give those guarantees to users. And that means I want hobbyists, people, et cetera, that have an interest in using the chain to run nodes. This is where I think there's a big distinction for me. I think validators that are just running, staking services are like the least. They're like the bottom users. And this is maybe different from Ethereum, where you're like, this is global self sovereign money. I'm going to put it in my cold storage, and I'm going to run my raspberry PI.
00:53:30.874 - 00:54:21.786, Speaker B: And as long as I run my raspberry PI, I get guarantees that no one created more ethereum that Peter didn't say, we're going to mint more ethereum and change the inflation. So the idea around the way Ethereum is constructed, is from its bottom, to be this. Like, I have my piece of gold, right? And I store it in cold storage, and I run the cheapest system to support that. And I don't care about transacting the chain. All I care about is making sure that my piece of gold, nobody fucks with it and creates more dupes it, right? That makes sense. If you start from that perspective, that all you care about is, like, self sovereign money. It makes sense to minimize hardware cost, because then that's kind of like the cost of storage, right, to the user.
00:54:21.786 - 00:54:51.978, Speaker B: But from my perspective, I'm like, solana Soul is just there to prevent spam in the network. That's it. Go use the network. That means run the nodes, use it, be a heavy user of the network. Go optimize the mev things. Go figure out how to do arbitrage between 50 different markets, or all this in the exact same atomic state machine that you have access to with one transaction. Go do all those things because it's cheap and it's fast, and you have a fair opportunity to do that.
00:54:51.978 - 00:55:27.942, Speaker B: So very different kind of like, if you care about that self issued digital money that is ultrasound, and you want to minimize your risk of the Peter and the dishonest majority creating a fork of Ethereum that mints extra Ethereum, and somehow you not knowing about it because you didn't run a full node then, yeah, the Ethereum kind of like hardware minimalism kind of is the way to go. And then you push all this complexity up to the roll ups and stuff like that.
00:55:28.076 - 00:55:55.360, Speaker A: You said that ETh could be the asset for Solana. You said that ETH could be the medium of exchange on Solana. This is another scenario where we both know what you're doing here, right? This is trivializing the ultrasound money thesis. This isn't you co signing like, oh, yeah, that is extra sound money. That should be the currency of Solana. You're like, I literally don't care.
00:55:56.130 - 00:55:58.666, Speaker B: It could be bog, it could be Austria.
00:55:58.858 - 00:56:33.519, Speaker A: Okay, yes. But here's one thing, and I think this is something that. I think that Ethereum maybe initially had similar views as you. If you go back and listen to Vitalik early on, and when he's asked is ETH money, he gives, like, equally nebulous or much less defined than the ultrasound money. Now, of course, you get like, yep, one five nine, and like. So there's been some obvious reasons now why we've moved towards this ultrasound money idea. But early on, I think that it was computational units or whatever you want to call it.
00:56:33.519 - 00:56:54.814, Speaker A: It was this kind of like poker chips in the casino. And then. Yes, exactly. But I think what they. And I don't know, you seem to have a hardline stance on this, and I'm interested to see how Solana evolves as a result. But I think the conclusion they came to is ultimately, this has to trend toward a money. Now, what money means, of course, is.
00:56:54.814 - 00:57:28.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm maybe more in agreement with you, but also, I don't know if that's the bitcoin are going to be coming out. And so I'm probably biased. I mean, I think their in game was like, look, this has to trend toward a money, because over the long run, we need to be able to support a robust validator network, and they need to be paid in something that is akin to a money. And I think you're saying, like, it doesn't actually matter. And as long as validators are paid a sufficient amount to keep validating for the network, then who cares what's used to top the chain? I do think you genuinely believe in that. I believe you're telling the truth when you say that. Let's put it that way.
00:57:29.890 - 00:58:11.014, Speaker B: Yeah. One is, there's no way to code money into it. You just have to repeat it. And it's not a succinct engineering vision for me in its own. I think you can say, my parents, we left the Soviet Union as refugees, literally, and the USSR would let them take $50 per person. So I totally understand the idea of self sovereign money that's censorship resistant. And USDC is competing for that as much as bitcoin, as much as any cryptographically signed, self generated key pair asset.
00:58:11.014 - 00:58:16.810, Speaker B: Because my parents in the Soviet Union, had this technology been available, would have just gotten some tether.
00:58:17.710 - 00:58:23.210, Speaker A: Yeah, but this isn't the vision. Totally. Come on. This is the short term vision.
00:58:24.750 - 00:58:28.858, Speaker B: Tether would have found their account and frozen it somehow.
00:58:28.954 - 00:58:39.570, Speaker A: No, but I will say this. Come on. There's some belief we have to have in some currency outside, I think. Sure.
00:58:39.640 - 00:58:40.978, Speaker B: Agreed. And it's awesome.
00:58:41.064 - 00:58:43.154, Speaker A: All right, then they're on the same side. Right?
00:58:43.272 - 00:59:09.930, Speaker B: And bitcoin is awesome. And I think the most simplest implementation of it is the coolest one, because you can kind of look at it, analyze it, I can rewrite it in one day in c or go. Or python and kind of reprocess the ledge and be like, okay, this is all here. And that's very cool and very easy to handle and, like, ten minute blocks, whatever. Who cares. Bunker coin is awesome. Bunker coin should exist.
00:59:10.670 - 00:59:14.686, Speaker A: No, it's bitcoin. You're just not convinced yet.
00:59:14.868 - 00:59:21.774, Speaker B: No, I'm very happy with bitcoin being bunker coin, but that is already, like a thing that was created. There's no point.
00:59:21.812 - 00:59:22.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree.
00:59:23.190 - 01:00:03.326, Speaker B: Right. And if you're competing about money that's being exchanged, that is a product, and there is a bajillion of like that is literally localized to the language, kind of money to the San Francisco. Stablecoin should probably be different than the Miami one simply because you can advertise it differently. Right. And then what you have is like, well, why don't we build a computer where all these things can run and be as fast and as cheap as possible, and then everyone can compete for all those things. And that I'm good at. So I know how to build that because I spent my career doing that.
01:00:03.326 - 01:00:28.338, Speaker B: And it doesn't try to build something that already exists, which is bitcoin, and it does something useful. It minimizes the latency, like information error between this global computer that all this money flows through and the real world, and that is value creation. I don't feel bad about working on it.
01:00:28.504 - 01:00:29.220, Speaker A: No.
01:00:31.770 - 01:00:54.170, Speaker B: People use soul as money because they buy nfts with them. So they use it as, like. I don't know why. I don't know why that took off versus USDC. Because when we built the original metaplex contracts, it was any SPL token could be used to buy nfts. And when we did our first auction, because our lawyers are terrified of using Sol, they were in USDC.
01:00:54.830 - 01:00:59.390, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's much better to even like is much better than USDC.
01:00:59.730 - 01:01:00.382, Speaker B: Why?
01:01:00.516 - 01:02:08.754, Speaker A: It's because it's more of the vibe. You have to understand the energy of, like, we have to believe in something outside of the state. I think any currency outside of the control of nation states is preferable. And, yeah, I know what you're doing, though, and I understand why, as a result, you're not trying to compete with bitcoin. I think one thing that, I don't know, maybe this is just me thinking this way, but one thing I saw when l two s sort of started to come out seemingly every day, is, and I'm not sure I'm going to phrase this exactly right, but I think you'll understand what I'm saying. It's like when you see that this type of code is almost like, infinitely replicable, right? It can be commoditized down to copy and paste. Once you see that, it's almost like, oh, its value has to be derived from what is built atop it, right? Whatever applications, whatever tools, it quite literally has to be derived from that, right? Because it's so easily forkable.
01:02:08.754 - 01:02:39.280, Speaker A: Now, we can get into discussion about network effects, so on and so forth. But this is something that I think I probably believe before. But as I saw l two, after l two, after l two. And once again, I'm not really taking a side here. I'm also an ethereum supporter. Okay, just like, as much as I troll about this, but it's one of these things where I saw, I was like, oh, if you can launch another one of these day in, day out, it's one of these things where it's like, okay, well, it has to come from what sits atop it. And I think this is sort of.
01:02:39.280 - 01:02:43.838, Speaker A: I do believe this is generally what you think.
01:02:44.004 - 01:03:05.474, Speaker B: Well, the marginal value of each additional l two gets lower and lower. Just like somebody created bitcoin, there was a lot of value created in that institution. The protocol itself is valuable. It doesn't matter how many bitcoin there are, 21 million or 42 million, right. You're not creating more wealth by adding more bitcoin to the protocol. Right. The protocol is valuable.
01:03:05.474 - 01:04:01.098, Speaker B: Each additional fork with a difference might have some value, there's some marginal value to litecoin existing. But further down you go the line, the less valuable it becomes, because it's just like differentiation becomes lower and lower. And similarly, I think with l two s, arbitram and optimism and the Zk stuff, and then you get further and further down the line that, okay, you're launching an l two because you want to capture all the user fees. That's great. That's a business model. And maybe that works, but that in itself does not create value for users. Right? That's a business model that you're like, we are going to get user fees if they use this computer, right, but what are you selling to the user that is actually creating value that is lost in each additional l two? And that's not even apparent from any of the l two s.
01:04:01.098 - 01:04:17.150, Speaker B: What does the user get right, from using arbitrary versus ek sync versus any of these other ones? As long as you can build some infra and ship a token and it has market value north of 100 mil, people are going to keep doing it forever.
01:04:19.410 - 01:05:04.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is part of what sparked a lot of the alignment discussion that we were talking about. Like, when people see that there seemed to be an infinite number of these, and it wasn't immediately clear what exactly was the additional value proposition. I think what you said was actually quite interesting. You said you hope that there's a hundred. I forget your exact word. You hope that there's 100 applications that are more valuable than Solana itself. I still like, just intuitively, it's hard to kind of see this.
01:05:04.900 - 01:05:06.400, Speaker B: There's no economic security.
01:05:07.090 - 01:05:09.166, Speaker A: Right? Exactly.
01:05:09.348 - 01:05:21.650, Speaker B: How are they going to be secure if they're more valuable than the l one? Because people run full nodes and they get security from running their own full nodes. There's no economic security. It's a meme.
01:05:21.990 - 01:06:29.100, Speaker A: Yeah. This is quite a contentious statement here. I think that this is something that most everybody on Ethereum would disagree with you about. And I'm not saying you're wrong, and I don't have a strong opinion one way or another. I think a lot of people saw the consolidation of stake on Ethereum, and I think a lot of people realize that proof of stake network is probably ten this way. And then it sort of becomes maybe less intuitive why transaction fees are 100 x on Ethereum versus Salana. You know what I mean? And one point that sort of I objected to pretty strongly, and I think you're going to 100% agree with this was like, there were people who would say that somebody would swap $300 worth of a token and pay a $50 transaction fee for the economic security.
01:06:29.100 - 01:07:25.286, Speaker A: And I'm like, surely you understand that they think that $300 is going to turn into $30,000. That is why I think the sort of counterpoint to this oftentimes was like, well, the liquidity exists on Ethereum and it's like, yes, but what we're talking about right now are coins that launched like 45 minutes ago. Okay, we're not talking about, this isn't like some like, oh, someone's only launching some Dog enu coin on Ethereum. It's just because the liquidity is there. Right? Yeah. And this is something, to be honest, when I heard this sort of regurgitated in different ways over and over, I'm like, okay, come on, we can't be serious right now, right? Users don't want to pay $50 for a $300 transaction. And indeed, we've seen a lot of the meme coining.
01:07:25.286 - 01:07:34.046, Speaker A: Now move over to Salana. I don't know my personal feelings on this, but I think it's sort of proving that point.
01:07:34.228 - 01:08:18.220, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, when you're paying the fee, you're paying congestion pricing effectively, because some part of the pipeline, whether the mempool or whatever, is saturated and everyone is fighting to be first in the block and you're trying to outbid them. So that's kind of just part of life in the system that doesn't have a lot of resources. If it's like demand exceeds supply, you're going to have fee spikes. So you have to increase the supply. And it's tricky to do it in a single threaded kind of environment like EvM. Even if they increased gas, tripled it or quadrupled it, you're going to have a lot of the similar dynamics and a lot of it is going to get saturated pretty quickly.
01:08:18.220 - 01:08:54.920, Speaker B: Again, as I've said, I don't believe in economic security. I think people are using Ethereum because it's there and they can make money there, right? Yeah, well, they can make money there, right? So the fees are not high enough to where they're prevent them from making money, so they're going to continue using it. But systems that are much lower fees people, once they start using them for that same purpose, they're not going to go back. Right. Once the opportunities move over, it's just going to a matter of time. So I don't know how long that's going to remain to be true. On.
01:08:56.730 - 01:09:28.354, Speaker A: Wait, let me just ask a quick think. Do you think that binance smart chain didn't have the same level of, I don't know, meme coining? And maybe not even just meme coin. It's like economic activity, let's call it, because of its centralization vectors or these other chains that have not been able to really cut into Ethereum's market share, but that are much cheaper. What do you say to that?
01:09:28.472 - 01:09:38.520, Speaker B: I mean, they think they have quite a bit. BnB and Tron have a huge user base. That user base is not going to switch to Ethereum ever.
01:09:41.370 - 01:09:46.694, Speaker A: Maybe the goal is to bring them to l two s if that pans out.
01:09:46.892 - 01:10:41.658, Speaker B: But now you're not talking about an order of magnitude improvement, you're talking about basically maybe a couple of percentage point improvements, like the fees, like in terms of fees or finality or all this stuff like the UX that the user cares about on TrON and Bnb is already like l two s may be marginally better than BnB and Tron on any of those. I don't even know if they are. But once you kind of get past the bottlenecks and Ethereum and you do any other bare bones optimizations and you end up in some state like Solana or Bnb or TrON, the next improvement is marginal users are not going to switch because of that. That alone is going to be like an improvement. That's not going to attract a new economy. You have to get something more right. You have to have new content, new launches, new all of this.
01:10:41.658 - 01:11:00.478, Speaker B: And maybe some l two s will figure that out. That's like a huge undertaking. Right. It takes a lot of effort to build that ecosystem up. But Tron and BnB, I'm sure, have their own teams that are all competing on this too. So now you see this, like, I don't know. I don't know.
01:11:00.478 - 01:12:11.894, Speaker B: People are still probably going to launch in the Ethereum, l one, because that's where just the value of the Ethereum is so high and enough people hold it, that are willing to spend it, move it into TBL and stuff is still there that it's worth launching on Ethereum. So me as a founder, if I was a founder, I raised money and I'm trying to be like, what is that next step for me to get from where I am to the next raise or next level of adoption? What I'm looking for profit, revenue users. Right. And where are you going to find probably in the Ethereum, l one Salana, stuff like that, and then the rest of the ecosystems. Maybe if you're in China, Tron and BnB are the better options for some of, like the, if Ethereum ever loses its market cap advantage, it might not be able to regain it if the random walk of life. Right. I think because once that happens, the rich people are now somewhere else and you no longer have that.
01:12:11.894 - 01:12:53.940, Speaker B: Like I'm going to launch an Ethereum because I can get Tvl quickly. Right. Basically what Ethereum has are the early frontech users that all join Frontech and increase the value of those points to astronomical levels and generate 20 million of revenue in one day. That's what Ethereum has. It's like a super target rich environment for the people that spend like 50,000 on clash of clans in a day. If you can find those people and build a product for all of them and they all join at the same time, you hit like a home run. That's really hard to achieve anywhere else.
01:12:55.770 - 01:13:21.462, Speaker A: Are you seeing the beginnings of this, do you think, with the Solana meme coins? And you, what are, what are your ideological beliefs about this? Because I saw our resident narrative leader talking about meme coins, sort of stress testing these protocols. Yeah.
01:13:21.536 - 01:14:09.690, Speaker B: Mobile gaming is like 100 billion industry. There are people that spend fifty k in a weekend on these games because they're rich and they want to kill everyone in their server or whatever. So there is that same kind of like power law distribution of 5% of the spenders generate 90% of the revenue. And I think it's the same dynamics with meme coins and nfts. People are kind of playing these PvP market games like you did in Runescape with these coins, and it's fun for them. I wouldn't look at that more than loot boxes effectively. These are like Clash of clan like PvP loot boxes in that sense.
01:14:09.690 - 01:14:43.240, Speaker B: I think it's awesome that the stakes are medium. We can work out all the problems, get multiple clients, figure out all the incentives to keep the system super safe, while the stakes are medium versus. This is like retirement money from Blackrock's 401. The. For everyone in the US, that would be terrifying. I don't even think ethereum is there yet to actually being able to handle that for now, that's great. I think that's like a use case.
01:14:43.240 - 01:15:09.920, Speaker B: It's actually smaller than it should be. If we're actually talking like 100 billion spend in mobile gaming. If that was all effectively captured by nfts and meme coins, the volumes would be astronomically larger. Like if that users externally contributed that much money into the system every year. That's an astronomical amount, right? 100 billion nods your head and say, yes.
01:15:12.470 - 01:15:13.182, Speaker A: I'm listening.
01:15:13.246 - 01:15:26.260, Speaker B: Right? Like, if actually we had real product market fit across that industry converted to nfts and meme coins, okay, we would be fine.
01:15:27.850 - 01:16:33.210, Speaker A: I wasn't nodding my head entirely. There was, because I'm just thinking about like, oftentimes I wonder, truly, this is something I think about a lot. There has long been this rationale in crypto. Speculation leads to innovation, and it's sort of this positive feedback loop. Like, people speculate, builders come in, they build for the speculators, then we optimize. But sometimes I'm looking at this circle kind of go around and I'm like, are we optimizing for better and better ways to speculate? And so one thing that I would say with mobile gaming, for example, whatever gaming, this isn't really my domain, but people enjoy gaming, and people will game when they're not being paid to do so. I do think it's similar, but are we really optimizing here more for the gambling aspect? And so then I wonder, does this translate, you know what I mean? Ideally, all the stocks in the world are traded on salon or something like that, right? This is your vision.
01:16:34.590 - 01:17:12.754, Speaker B: Because those are real world things that have real world outputs, generate value for the world. And if those are all synchronized on Solana for price discovery, the validators intrinsically have real world ROI to them because they're the ones that are like minimizing the information difference between all this price around the world. It's great. They're doing valuable work for the world. That would be awesome, I think, to get there. I think we still have a ways to go, not just on scaling and throughput, but on security. Like all the stuff that we talked about earlier.
01:17:12.754 - 01:17:32.080, Speaker B: Right. And the meme coins, I think are as entertaining as somebody dropping fifty k to soup up their clasher clans army and go kill everyone in their server. It's the same thing as somebody sweeping the floor in an NFT set for the same money. They get the same enjoyment out of that.
01:17:33.010 - 01:17:35.594, Speaker A: Yeah, the dopamine rush.
01:17:35.722 - 01:17:54.962, Speaker B: Exactly. Right. So they're doing it for the exact same reason. Doesn't matter. Why should 30% of that 50k go to Apple versus the developer that built the NFD directly? That's a different argument. But it's the same spend. It's on digital content.
01:17:54.962 - 01:18:29.066, Speaker B: It's luxury spending in digital content. So it's not like burning coal somewhere, right? It's fairly cheap and affordable to the world, so it's not like a bad thing. And it is forcing us to fix all these problems with incentives and security and liveness and all that. So I think it's fine for now. I'd like to see that part of the industry to evolve to be more. To build better games experiences and stuff like that. It'd be awesome if it was actually runescape and Eve online and all of these economies were on chain.
01:18:29.066 - 01:18:41.250, Speaker B: Like all that whole gaming vision. I wish that happened. But it's really hard to build really good games, a lot of money. Yeah, well, pal world.
01:18:41.320 - 01:19:14.718, Speaker A: Pal world just did a pretty cheap. Yeah, well, it is interesting because I saw you recently discussing USDC volumes on Solana and is it called Solana pay? Yeah, this is a legitimate use case, right? I'm not going to push stable coins. I know they're useful. Right? I know what you were talking about with your parents in Ukraine or. Yeah, where were you?
01:19:14.804 - 01:19:16.122, Speaker B: Fleeing union.
01:19:16.266 - 01:19:50.810, Speaker A: Soviet union. Fleeing. Okay, this would have obviously been useful, but at the same time, those of us in the first world, I feel like we should stand behind a currency that's not controlled by the state. But anyways, that was a bit of a digression. My point here was that it's interesting because oftentimes there's so much defi development, there's so much new things popping up every day in crypto. And yet when you hear founders talk, Vitalik is similar. You hear Vitalik talk about use cases, like he wrote a blog post, I forget, maybe like a year ago.
01:19:50.810 - 01:20:03.366, Speaker A: And a lot of his purported use cases were payments. It was payments. And this is one thing we have right now. It's true. Like, Solana pay me all the USDT.
01:20:03.398 - 01:20:07.162, Speaker B: On kicking ass on payments.
01:20:07.306 - 01:20:13.950, Speaker A: Yeah. What can Solana do to disrupt that, out of curiosity?
01:20:14.110 - 01:20:58.478, Speaker B: I think it's hard to disrupt. You got to find your own niche and product where you're naturally growing. So I would say, I think it's going to be hard to convince somebody to switch from TrOn USDT to Sol USDTC. Because the reason why they're using Tron UST is because everyone that they care is using TRON USDT for that particular use case. There's some niche that Tron UsTT filled, and that's really cool to see because it's programmable money. We should start seeing more and more niches filled. And all the activity that you see with SolUsDTC, it is a niche, right? That's being filled, I would say not as like touch.
01:20:58.478 - 01:22:01.010, Speaker B: I don't know how much of it is touching the real world economies of people trading goods for dollars and stuff, or remittances and things like that. So I think TrOn has done a pretty good job there and you got to find your niches. There's a bunch of companies building on remittance from Nigeria to the US and stuff like that. Visa obviously is doing their whole remittance thing. That's a cool use case. It's obviously better than traditional rails because it's much, much easier to deal with, but it's payments. Like, even if you have a better system, if you already have the personnel to write checks and get postage stamps and put the checks in the thing and send them out, those people are going to keep doing that even if you have fed now, right? That organization has to die.
01:22:01.350 - 01:22:20.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I think USDT on Tron would have to effectively become censored. Maybe that could be a reason that I could see moving to something like it would. It would truly have to be something like that in order. And if it's never really, go ahead.
01:22:20.624 - 01:22:31.946, Speaker B: But even to replace, like, checks, the people that are writing, wherever there's still people writing checks in a company, they're going to continue writing them until they retire. So it's going to be, yeah, I.
01:22:31.968 - 01:23:24.750, Speaker A: Still get checks from people. I have no idea why we still use checks. It's like the most cumbersome process, actually having to go and deposit a check and sign the back of it. Like, what are we doing? I don't even think they'd like. Yeah, no, this isn't lost upon me, but I do think that it is interesting. A lot of times I hear founders or people deeply in crypto, and when they're sort of pushed, or maybe it's just on their own accord, but when they talk about the practical use cases now, right, like in the here and now, it's oftentimes payments, and I don't hear people recommending complex defi applications, you know what I mean? It's for a niche group of users.
01:23:27.250 - 01:24:22.670, Speaker B: I think in a world where we get rwas and a whole bunch of stuff moving on chain, then lending protocols, all those things, I think are far more robust than traditional finance because they're basically doing that risk analysis in real time. So it's better, right? Like, Defi is better than traditional finance because you know exactly who has what loans outstanding and you can see them get to liquidation and you can deal with them. And that's great. It makes the failures much less painful than in traditional finance where somebody is lying about their assets. Right. And getting additional loans, and then it blows up in a much bigger way. Yeah, I think it's just really hard to get traction in that space because again, it's like writing checks.
01:24:22.670 - 01:24:51.974, Speaker B: Who are you going to convince to go do that? The bank already has a risk person that does this by hand, and you're like, well, I want to replace your job. I want to get you fired. It's not a very easy sales pitch. And then like, okay, so the risks are astronomical for the bank to do this. The cost savings are like a couple employees, so negligible. Right. So that's why it's just going to be a slog to get defi adoption.
01:24:51.974 - 01:26:12.066, Speaker B: It will slowly happen simply because I think if crypto survives and thrives, it's going to be because you will see real companies just skip the step of raising capital in Silicon Valley and ipoing on Nasdaq and Nizi, they'll simply just go get crypto capital, issue a token, build a, and like that whole maps of dealing with securities law will be worked out. And as soon as that happens, I think you'll start basically kind of slowly seeing acceleration of real world assets that have kind of natively been born on all these chains occur, and that weight is going to get bigger and bigger, and the lending protocols, all these things will start making more and more money, and then you'll start seeing Tradfi ossify because they're just not getting new talent in. Right. As soon as all the new talent starts launching crypto first, that's when you'll start seeing that shift. And it'll take a decade, but it'll happen. And frankly, what's missing is the stupid congress like fit 21 or whatever bill give us designations of what are what aren't securities, how to deal with security tokens on chain. As soon as all that's laid out.
01:26:12.066 - 01:26:21.558, Speaker B: In a lot of ways, I think it's kind of game over for Tradfot, but game over 1015 year period. But you'll start seeing the shift. Yeah.
01:26:21.724 - 01:26:32.330, Speaker A: All right, we're coming up on time here. One last question. Are you ever afraid to say something about Salana because Merck is going to come on and roast you on Twitter?
01:26:35.390 - 01:26:35.994, Speaker B: No.
01:26:36.112 - 01:26:40.940, Speaker A: Is this ever a concern? No. Never afraid of slipping up about your own.
01:26:43.150 - 01:26:49.230, Speaker B: That? Yeah. Please criticize it. Sunda's bug reports is an awesome bug. Pounty.
01:26:50.610 - 01:26:52.858, Speaker A: You're the only one that Burke respects.
01:26:53.034 - 01:26:57.440, Speaker B: It's code written by humans. That's it. It's the best we could do.
