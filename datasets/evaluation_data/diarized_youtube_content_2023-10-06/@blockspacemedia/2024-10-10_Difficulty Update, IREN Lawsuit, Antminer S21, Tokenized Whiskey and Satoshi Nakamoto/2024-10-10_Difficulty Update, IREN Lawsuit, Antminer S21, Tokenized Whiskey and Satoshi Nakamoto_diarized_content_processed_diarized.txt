00:00:09.017 - 00:00:11.925, Speaker B: At Miningpod Blockspace Media today.
00:00:13.145 - 00:00:34.403, Speaker A: Hey, welcome back to the mining pod. This is your news roundup. Bitcoin and bitcoin mining news. We're going to rip right into the episode. We're joined by Matt Kimmel of Coinshares and Colin Harper of Block Space Media fame. We got a lot on the docket, so I'll do a quick summary, but we're going to talk about and then we'll jump into it. Of course, as always, our difficulty update with Matt.
00:00:34.403 - 00:01:08.665, Speaker A: We'll start off there and then we're going to talk about Irene overseeing its megawatt capacity as a new lawsuit. Then we're go over to the Antminer S21 plus reveal, which at this point I'm just getting lost and what units we're even talking about these days. Tokenized whiskey with marathons and Duro Granberry hates marathon, as Colin puts it. Kind of an update in that whole saga with Granbury, Texas trying to boot marathon from the area. And then we're gonna finish up with a cry corner. A guest of this show. Farewell could be Satoshi Nakamoto.
00:01:08.665 - 00:01:15.945, Speaker A: We'll go first to you. I call it shaking his head. He's upset. We'll go to the difficulty update first, Matt.
00:01:17.375 - 00:01:47.615, Speaker C: Yes. At the time of recording it is October 10th and we just had a difficulty update. We went up 4% to the dismay of miners. We talked about last week how basically it was expected to be flat. Right. But the blocks becometh and what we talked about last week was the fact that the hurricane, Hurricane Helen was hitting the east coast and that many mining operations basically paused. There wasn't.
00:01:47.615 - 00:02:21.625, Speaker C: It doesn't seem to be like there was any catastrophic damage to the actual operations to which they didn't come back online. And in fact they certainly did, it appears come back online because hash rate absolutely sort of ripped. And now we're having a pretty strong difficulty increase kind of at the end of the period. Am I missing anything on the read there, guys? What do you think? In the last week there's been some that blocks have just gone come very quickly.
00:02:23.325 - 00:03:09.903, Speaker D: So I was talking to Matt Lousteau at Giga. He had listened to one of our roundups where we covered I think it was two weeks ago as you and me, Matt, and we had kind of covered the seesawing of hash rate and difficulty and I had chalked some of it up to the launch of fractal bitcoin which took a lot of hash rate from away from Bitcoin 30 to 40x a hashes worth for short period. One thing that Matt pointed out is that the Midwest has had unseasonably warm weather later in the summer and in the early fall and he thinks that there might have been some curtailment that also impacted hash rate in the region. So shout out to Matt Lusto. I don't know if that's true, but that is one theory he posited. So it could maybe that's affecting it. And now that things are cooling down, miners are revving back up.
00:03:09.903 - 00:03:12.535, Speaker D: Less curtailment happening. So. So who knows.
00:03:13.675 - 00:03:33.403, Speaker A: Bitcoin miner Iris Energy accused of overstating data center capacity and lawsuit. Lawsuit claims that Iris Energy, they're formerly known as Iris Energy but now they're Irene knew or should have known that it's children's site. Children's county site in Texas was a poor fit for hpc. Jump on into that one.
00:03:33.499 - 00:04:14.219, Speaker D: Yeah, it is bitcoin mining lawsuit season it seems had the swan lawsuit dropped. We're about to cover another lawsuit as well after this one with Mara and the town of Granbury. This I found this and I just kind of saw it today. Actually I find it interesting for a couple of reasons. Number one, Iron is pushing for retrofitting data centers for HPC and AI load. They're one of the few miners doing that, including Core Scientific and we have had a few guests on the mining podcast. I've also talked to some people in the background about this and there's still a lot of doubt as to whether or not pulling this off is even possible.
00:04:14.219 - 00:04:50.491, Speaker D: Now Iron already has revenue. They booked like I think $680,000 for last month for their AI and HPC business line. So they're obviously like there are customers there, they are providing these services and they're reporting that revenue. So I would find it hard to believe that there's no chance that they could retrofit. But it seems like these investors are suing them, saying that they overstated their ability to specifically retrofit their site in Texas. The Childress site going to be keeping an eye on this, whether or not this will actually be fruitful for the people suing them. I don't know if the plaintiffs actually have a case here.
00:04:50.491 - 00:05:25.473, Speaker D: Not a lawyer, no idea where this is going to go. I do think it is interesting to contextualize with the AI revolution with these bitcoin miners though, right? I mean, I've come back to this a thousand times. There are a few different ways they could pull this off. Retrofitting is the highest reward, but also the highest risk because no one's ever done it before. Right. So I think this will be a story to keep our eyes on and could be decisive in terms of, you know, setting expectations for whether or not bitcoin miners can retrofit their facilities in the first place for hpc. So not too many takes outside of that.
00:05:25.473 - 00:05:42.739, Speaker D: I think that's interesting. And you know, these miners are kind of getting sued all the time by people. If you go through, seriously, if you go through like 10 Qs from some of the, from a lot of the leading public miners, you'll see like random lawsuits that crop up. So but this one is topical, I think, given all the HBC news.
00:05:42.787 - 00:06:34.265, Speaker A: So a few thoughts on this. I'd say like Core Scientific is also doing the retrofitting, but they put a bunch of money into it and that was the center of this conversation, which I will add to screen for those watching, which is a Culpepper research short in July where they described Iris Energy as a Prius at the Grand Prix. Basically showing up to the HBC scene and not really being able to compete because it doesn't have, you know, the engine under the hood to compete with the hyperscalers. This short. I think they closed it out at this time but there's still like a few tweets from the Culpepper team taking shots at Iris Energy over the last few weeks. And I think if you're interested in the anti case for Irene, go give us a read. It is pretty interesting.
00:06:34.265 - 00:07:24.815, Speaker A: The fundamental thing here, right is like can you turn a bitcoin mining site into an HPC AI site? And Irene is saying we can take our preexisting infrastructure, our air cool sites and turn them into AI hpc and then we can also use these really cheap energy contracts to capitalize on that in a way hyperscalers can't. And the Culpepper team and then people who are short or just neutral on Iris would say no, you can't do that. The costs are so significantly different. The. Yeah, I'll leave it there for, for Matt. For any thoughts you have, I will say like the numbers are quite different. We're looking at 15 to 20 million dollars per megawatt for build for HPC versus Irene's estimates are like that more traditional million dollar range for bitcoin mining.
00:07:28.355 - 00:08:03.045, Speaker C: You guys really covered a lot of what my Thoughts were on this story. I think you hit it on the head, Will. The question is, and it's kind of hitting broadly a bunch of different companies right now, can you take a mining site and turn it into an AI HPC site? And at what cost can you do it profitably? And yeah, that's the ultimate question to Collins Point. Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits. It seems like one of the major winners in the mining space are the legal teams.
00:08:04.345 - 00:08:10.553, Speaker A: Many such cases around the world, lawyers be winning.
00:08:10.689 - 00:08:52.194, Speaker D: One more thing just to contextualize Irons mining and HPC business. Their pilot contract was with a company called Poolside that lapsed in August. In their last update and I cover this on Block Space with the most recent mining pod newsletter, they're. They're a poolside contract lapse. They claim to have 10 others in the pipeline, but they have not disclosed who that's with. And that's really the biggest question here is if you have a small HBC footprint, can you actually broker deals? Thomasro of Cathedral, formerly Kungsleden, said that actually the smaller players have an edge in some cases because they can tap into clients that are not big enough for the hyperscalers. So there's a consideration there.
00:08:52.194 - 00:09:14.821, Speaker D: But it really does call into question. You have Iron kind of piddling around with some of these smaller contracts. Core Scientific has booked. If the revenue is fully realized and the contract is completed the way they say it's going to be, $2 billion worth of deal flow with Core weave over the next. Like I think it's five to 10 years. Don't. I don't know the exact date, but I do know the $2 billion mark is more or less in the, in the right ballpark.
00:09:14.821 - 00:09:25.945, Speaker D: It's just a completely different level. I mean they're trying to build out 382 megawatts worth of HPC. So lots of questions as to whether or not the small, the small guys can keep up with something like that.
00:09:27.085 - 00:10:00.435, Speaker A: Okay, let's go over to the minor mag our friends. As always, Bitmain rolls out S21 plus Bitcoin miners boasting 15 jewels per tera hash efficiency S21 marks. Newest addition to the Antminer S21 product line. So this announcement was at Bitcoin Amsterdam, which is closing today. We're recording this Thursday afternoon. I believe that they just closed the event for the week. Looked pretty successful, but they rolled out these new units with a lot of hashtags and emojis on their Twitter page.
00:10:00.435 - 00:10:26.237, Speaker A: They're pretty like they're pretty baller sites or units. Colin, I want to get your thoughts on this. The thing that stood out to me was one, I'm getting confused where we're at in the S21 series and two, these have slightly higher meaning less efficient joules per terahash than the other S21 units that we saw come out over the summer and only by a little bit, by a few joules per terahash. But wanted to get your thoughts on that.
00:10:26.341 - 00:11:20.695, Speaker D: Yeah, so this is pretty common. Every time Bitmain gets a tape out from TSMC and they release a new series, the the wafers that they get have different calibers of chips in the wafers. Not every chip is the same. Sometimes they allocate the best chips towards their most efficient models and vice versa for the least efficient chips in an individual tape out a few things. This reminds me of newsletter that we had a while back, talked to some people in the ASIC trading business and they said that what they were seeing on their side is that miners are getting hesitant to purchase new S21 units because they're thinking in a few months there's going to be another unit out. To your point, Will, we're kind of getting lost and kind of dazed by all of these new S21 units. And it seems like this series and this new generation of ant miners bit has continued to like push new units out faster than they have in the past.
00:11:20.695 - 00:12:18.653, Speaker D: And our source for that newsletter, a few weeks ago, or maybe it was about a month ago, they basically said miners are hesitant to purchase them. Bitmain's having trouble moving units because miners don't want to buy the S21 and then see the S21 Pro and then the S21 plus and then the S21 XP come out within the months following. Right. A lot of miners actually had to have their S21 orders upgraded to the S21 Pro because they raised such a ruckus with Bitmain and were pissed off at the fact that they had just bought the latest generation machine only to see a new one superseded. A few months after, I talked to some other people, you know, I talked to Terrace of Syntec who said that he didn't see Bitmain having any problems necessarily moving units. So maybe that maybe my source was seeing a different part of the market that is more hesitant. But at the end of the day, I do think that this rapid succession of increasingly more efficient miners kind of creates a difficulty for Bitmain to move some of the supply and frustration from the mining side.
00:12:18.653 - 00:12:43.645, Speaker D: It does seem just to highlight that point that the S21 series has had a rapid succession of models being released and the efficiency gains aren't too crazy. But even if it's like one joule per terahash and the price is a little bit lower because the market's lower from where it was when they bought the S21, that's a big deal to miners buying pallets of these things. So it's just kind of some thoughts on that.
00:12:45.515 - 00:13:13.849, Speaker A: It is a big deal. We'll see how that kind of shakes out. I mean, I think it continues to dominate that side of the industry and people are having a hard time catching up. I would like to get some more brokers on the show maybe soon. Trying to have sales people on, but give them a little feel for where people are thinking going in 2025 would be interesting. So maybe Colin and I will chat about that. Matt, any thoughts before we move on to our last section? Actually, we had two more sections.
00:13:13.849 - 00:13:17.513, Speaker A: What am I talking about? Yeah, Tokenized whiskey and Marathon.
00:13:17.569 - 00:13:26.977, Speaker C: Still, it's just amazing. The Asics keep getting better. Like early when I was growing up in this space, it was oh, commodifications.
00:13:27.081 - 00:13:28.365, Speaker A: Back in my day.
00:13:30.305 - 00:14:12.485, Speaker C: You know what I mean though that was like a often said thing. Asic commodifications right around the corner. It was, it's, it was right up there with hash rate derivatives right around the corner and. But the machines, they keep getting better and better. And honestly, good on the miners for basically catching on and adapting and realizing that they could wait until the next model comes out before they upgrade or maybe just see that, you know, their ROI period pays off and kind of adjust their forecast before going on and kind of yeeting themselves into the next large capex spend. But we shall move on. Those are pretty much all my thoughts there.
00:14:15.025 - 00:14:42.499, Speaker E: In the competitive world of bitcoin mining, one name stands out. CleanSpark, America's Bitcoin miner. At CleanSpark, efficiency isn't just a goal. It's our standard. Our sophisticated facilities are built and led by x expert teams who care about bitcoin and the communities we work in scale. We've mastered it. Our large scale operations have set us apart in the industry.
00:14:42.499 - 00:15:02.109, Speaker E: As examples of community oriented building, our track record speaks for itself. We navigate the complexities of the new economy with precision and with skill, continuously achieving operational milestones. Curious about how we do it, we invite you to discover the story behind.
00:15:02.157 - 00:15:50.115, Speaker A: CleanSpark success@cleanspark.com okay, let's dig into this story from Marathon. Marathon launched enduro it's a L2 platform, a merge mine platform. Sort of uses Marathon pools own hash rate to be able to facilitate different expressive protocols and projects on top of Anduro in that merge mind sidechain. Probably a few words we could argue over there and like what that actually means, but we're going to set this aside. Essentially they have come up with a tokenization platform and they're starting with Whiskey. According to CoinDesk, Enduro has developed the Real World Asset RWA Project Avant alongside tokenization platform Vertolo and they will tokenize whiskey barrels in a pilot project.
00:15:50.115 - 00:16:50.973, Speaker A: RWAs for background for listeners has long been a big project within crypto where we take real world things like gold or silver or commodities like oil. I've even seen railroad contracts tokenize them and then enable them to be traded in a more frictionless way through Uniswap or just Metamask Wallet. Now the downside to all these things of course is like if we're supposed to have permissionless money and permissionless tokens and it's tied as asset, that is in a very physical place that seems to not quite work. And so people have always wondered about that regulatory side of things and the legal side of things. And then also I just don't think like a lot of people care about this stuff because at the end of the day, people buy tokens that have meme potential and go up 99% or go up 100x and a barrel of whiskey, it's great. But it's probably not going 100x.
00:16:51.109 - 00:17:50.291, Speaker D: It's like what problem is this solving though, right? With Bitcoin you're solving trust issues and transferring money. I mean, is there really a trust issue when buying? Like when you know if someone's going to buy a barrel of whiskey or if someone's going to buy a pint or a gallon of whiskey. If you're like a bar and you're. Or whatever and you're buying them, like did you really have problems trusting whether or not you're going to get that delivered? Do you really need a blockchain to facilitate the transfer of that asset and represent it? It just like you said, Will, this has been talked about ad nauseam probably since like 2016, the tokenization of the world. And unless there is friction or a level of trust that you need to obviate in that transaction, there's no reason to do this. So it seems like Marathon's trying to spin up use cases for Enduro, which makes sense. They want transaction fees to increase on the Platform, But I don't really understand what this does, you know, Matt, give.
00:17:50.323 - 00:17:52.095, Speaker A: The steel man for it.
00:17:53.635 - 00:19:36.471, Speaker C: Well, I'll say the classical example, the classic example of a successful real world asset project, even though it wasn't called it at the time because that jargon didn't exist, is tether, right? Which basically custodies treasuries different cash and cash equivalents and basically issues a dollar token on different chains. And why has that been so successful? Well, dollar assets aren't easily attainable in many parts of the world. And so what it is basically doing is saying, all right, well there are chains out there. Whether you trust that they are secure and kind of the counterparty risk of the chain is relevant to you is a separate discussion, right? And the counterparty risk of the issuer tether and whether they will actually be solvent and basically create and redeem these assets in a way that doesn't lead themselves to bankruptcy and lose the tide to the dollar peg of the actual token that they're issuing. All of that stuff aside, right, what these chains are doing is they are available on the Internet globally. And so if you are in a place where you're willing to accept those risks and you don't have an alternative access to any of those assets, then you can go get USDT and you can move dollars around, you can hold it alongside your local currency, which may not be doing well from an inflation perspective or maybe there's really high restrictions on what you can do from a capital controls perspective. So I will say that's kind of the case.
00:19:36.471 - 00:20:58.323, Speaker C: Now let's bring that to Whiskey, right, And think about this for a second. And yeah, I will say, like the line of this article to me, and I hope you guys share in the excitement for this, it says, quote, this is CoinDesk article, quote, Andura wants to avoid taking a real world asset play that exists on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains and simply cut and paste it to bitcoin. But instead it is looking to offer something that, quote, unquote, a bitcoiner would understand. And this is a product lead for Andro, which leads me to believe, gentlemen, that bitcoiners love whiskey. Is that the large takeaway from this article and that that is the selling point, like the comedy of that aside, why is Marathon doing this Merge Mind sidechain and this project, which the success of which we can certainly debate, they want to try to make extra money. It's like, why were people participating in the Merge Mind fractal ecosystem where you could basically Profit off the degen activity. It's a money play.
00:20:58.323 - 00:21:17.015, Speaker C: Miners are mercenaries. They're going to go wherever the cash flow takes them. I don't know if this will actually bring another revenue stream to marathon. I'm not trying to argue that, but I think broadly that is kind of the point of this. What do you think?
00:21:17.355 - 00:22:07.773, Speaker A: I think the idea of DeFi giving access to new markets is big. You know, we do live in the world of TikTok and YouTube where you can find out about new things and the fact that you can just go in and invest in those. So say you get really interested in whiskey and you're like, how do I invest in whiskey? And now you can like invest in this tokenized whiskey project. That's a cool idea. Now the question for us bitcoiners is like, okay, is that actually real? Are you like being gipped? Is there like a bunch of like shenanigans. Shenanigans going in the background and probably yes. But I do like generally support the idea of DeFi and having permissionless assets on chain because it does open the world up to more investments as opposed to like, I need my Schwab account and I need to have a US bank account and needs to be like regulated by FDIC and all these other government agencies.
00:22:07.773 - 00:22:28.939, Speaker A: That being said, from a mining standpoint, like we've seen these projects tried to exist before and eth world and they just haven't really gone anywhere. Like the one that comes to mind is Maker Dao. They've tried to onboard RWAs for their stablecoin project and basically use RWAs as collateral for stablecoins and it really hasn't gone anywhere.
00:22:28.987 - 00:22:36.827, Speaker D: Besides, making liquidity is terrible for that. Right. That's why the USDC and other stable coins are like what the majority of.
00:22:36.891 - 00:22:41.855, Speaker A: Pain to pain on board, like whiskey barrels for collateral.
00:22:42.955 - 00:23:11.855, Speaker D: Also the other thing too is like maybe for a derivative contract, tokenizing it makes sense. But I guess my question is like I bought three, three whiskey barrels and they just sit there as, you know, like, do I get custody of the whiskey barrels? What. What am I putting? What am I buying here? And. And then on the other side, if you're actually using the underlying commodity, I. E. Whiskey in your business, do you need the token to facilitate that transaction? I don't think. Sorry not to.
00:23:12.235 - 00:23:41.621, Speaker C: Yeah. And I mean typically you don't trade kind of manufactured goods. Maybe the underlying commodity, like the grain that kind of goes into the whiskey, like that's kind of in the futures market and things like that. But I will say like what I'm going to zoom out for a while. It has long been discussed in the bitcoin ecosystem basically how to have much greater financial activity settled down into simple peer to peer transactions.
00:23:41.693 - 00:23:42.165, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:42.285 - 00:24:45.275, Speaker C: And so it's the question has kind of often been do we recreate everything within this kind of new alternative monetary system or do we somehow try to doctor the existing financial ecosystem to kind of stack on top of it and have much more complex financial transactions basically boil down into simple peer to peer transfers? And the verdict on that is totally unknown. But what is this platform and its example where they're kind of just trying to create an asset and see if that works from again counterparty risk perspective, if it actually makes sense and people use it, if there's a market for it. But eventually I would hope if this is really going to be a globally adopted system that everything stacks on top of, we will figure out at some point how to bring debt equities, general commerce to the bitcoin space. How we do that, I don't know. Maybe Bitcoin season two will talk about it. Will I don't know.
00:24:45.775 - 00:25:23.035, Speaker A: Another show from Block Space Media, Bitcoin Season 2. I think last thing I'll mention on this is Marathon has been really put in a lot of money cycle into different revenue lines, whether that be Enduro, whether that be slipstream and ordinals. And then they have this big crypto bitcoin global climate change thing that they're working on really hard and now they're doing the Marathon Michael Saylor play. So they got a lot going on like a lot of different themes and narratives for Marathon and this is just yet another one.
00:25:23.495 - 00:25:27.903, Speaker D: Let's speaking of games for Marathon, speaking.
00:25:27.959 - 00:25:32.823, Speaker A: Of which, really good transition there. Let's pull that one up.
00:25:32.959 - 00:25:39.799, Speaker D: The city of Granbury, Texas hates Marathon is how I wrote this in the show notes.
00:25:39.967 - 00:25:41.863, Speaker A: Just rip on it Colin. Just rip it.
00:25:41.959 - 00:25:42.279, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:42.327 - 00:26:11.321, Speaker D: So Texas Town in Granbury, Texas is suing Marathon Digital for its mining facility nearby, causing a nuisance. There's been some prior reporting from Time on this. There was a huge hit piece against Mara. Now Marathon purchased this facility from HUD 8. It was part of the USBTC was managing it after the Celsius bankruptcy a few years ago. HUD@USPTC Merged text. Marathon had like a majority of their hash rate there.
00:26:11.321 - 00:26:46.195, Speaker D: They ended up just purchasing the site or they had most of the capacity there. They ended up purchasing the site from Hut 8. Now the lawsuit claimed, according to this Cointelegraph article, that some residents have suffered sensory, emotional, psychological and health impacts due to constant unrelenting noise and vibrations from Marathon site. It added that some locals have experienced fatigue, headaches, memory issues, hearing loss, migraines and tinnitus. The group also alleged that preexisting health conditions such as high blood pressure have worsened for some residents. Quote, even in their own homes, residents can hear Mara's crypto mines noise and feel its vibrations. The suit claims.
00:26:46.195 - 00:27:18.133, Speaker D: It said Marathon site substantially interferes with plaintiffs members private use and enjoyment of their properties. Now, two things. I just want to say something right out the gate. Noise pollution for crypto mines is a big thing and it should be managed. And I don't want to dismiss any legitimate claims about it disrupting people's lives. There have been numerous stories all across the US of miners coming in, buying up some land, deploying, and they don't think about it and it's noisy and people get pissed off. Right.
00:27:18.133 - 00:27:54.655, Speaker D: And then it causes a whole problem for everyone. Bitcoin gets a bad rap, yada yada yada. That being said, making claims that people's blood pressure and they're getting headaches and fatigue because of a bitcoin mine, especially one like the Granberry mines provoked pretty far removed. I think like Time did a decibel reading and tried to claim that like as far as 10 miles away, you could hear it. I've talked to operators and bitcoin miners. That is almost demonstrably nonsense. Like there should be no way that those decibels reach a 10 mile, you know, span from a mine even this big.
00:27:54.655 - 00:28:12.875, Speaker D: So a little bit skeptical of this noise pollution. Not good. Hopefully that's, you know, Marathon's got that under wraps. Some of the other claims here of like severe and deleterious health impacts, I just, I find that hard to square. But I don't know what if y'all have other opinions here.
00:28:14.775 - 00:28:18.875, Speaker C: My blood is boiling just thinking about it. So he's upset.
00:28:19.175 - 00:28:34.405, Speaker A: I mean, isn't a follow up from the Time magazine piece from a few months ago. This has been ongoing and now we have a lawsuit. So it's good to check in with this one. I believe Marathon went ahead and swapped out a lot of units and put in immersion thanks into this facility.
00:28:35.585 - 00:28:40.977, Speaker D: This is true. That was part of their most recent update. They're working on upgrading to immersion.
00:28:41.081 - 00:29:10.135, Speaker A: Yeah, it doesn't seem like it was complete and this site had a ton of air units, I believe. So it's probably more to do. I've heard both sides. I've heard from People who've been there that if you are near the site, you can't hear it. I mean it is like a low hum, but it's within like industrial standards. If you are standing right next to the site, of course it's loud, but yeah, I think we're going to see more of these forever, these regional stories. So I don't have too much of a take on it, Matt.
00:29:10.435 - 00:29:16.947, Speaker C: No, I think Colin covered it well. Let's. Let's push. Let's push to the last one which.
00:29:16.971 - 00:29:38.503, Speaker A: Pushed to the cry corner. Okay, so we had a lot of options for cry corner this week. We could have talked about Justin's son becoming the premier of Liberland, a non recognized country within Europe. That would have been a fun one. We could have talked about the FBI launching its own AI token to track down some nefarious token peddlers.
00:29:38.559 - 00:29:40.103, Speaker D: Pretty fun entrapment scheme.
00:29:40.199 - 00:29:50.925, Speaker A: That would have been. That would have been a good one we could talk about. But instead we have to talk about the bitcoin one, which is HBO releasing this documentary. Let's take a quick listen to the trailer.
00:29:54.865 - 00:30:15.895, Speaker F: Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin, could be one of the richest people on earth. But many years ago, satoshi had disappeared. And with bitcoin being woven into the fabric of the financial system, solidifying its role as digital gold, perhaps the question of satoshi's identity was more pressing than ever.
00:30:17.955 - 00:30:38.073, Speaker A: Okay, I think we can only play like 15 seconds for copyright reasons, but there you go. HBO put out new documentary called Money Electric discussing the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. It came to an interesting conclusion we will get to in just a moment. But really quick, you guys watched this, right? We're not going to give uninformed opinions.
00:30:38.219 - 00:30:43.293, Speaker D: No, I, I don't have much to comment here other than just the fact that I don't. Yeah, I don't know.
00:30:43.349 - 00:30:44.013, Speaker A: Lame.
00:30:44.189 - 00:30:44.829, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:44.957 - 00:30:45.665, Speaker A: Mad.
00:30:48.045 - 00:30:56.945, Speaker C: I can either confirm nor did I watched it as much as the answer to the question of who Satoshi was answered.
00:30:57.845 - 00:31:32.317, Speaker A: I watched half of it and I am going to try to finish it. It was hour and a half, I think and like as far as bitcoin documentaries go, pretty well done. A lot like the classic code on screen, dark faces. We don't know who Satoshi is, but they did a good job of interviewing Adam Back, Peter Todd, RACHEL ROSAL FORMER COINDESK that's nice. Yeah. So we get some familiar faces in there, which is cool. Obviously both the people are just saying mentioned Adam Back and Peter Todd have been on the mining pod.
00:31:32.317 - 00:31:55.465, Speaker A: So it's kind of fun to see them in a different role there. The problem with this, which everyone came to, is they. They named that Peter Todd was Satoshi, and there's lots of problems with that. What did you guys think about the reaction over the last few days after that was announced or released? Don't jump at the question.
00:31:56.935 - 00:31:58.355, Speaker D: You go ahead, Matt.
00:31:59.695 - 00:32:24.231, Speaker C: Okay. I. There's never a dull moment in this industry, and I think that as a community that is so online. Right. It was just perfect to just like. It's like throwing a little bit of bread into a pond that is just swimming full of fish. Everyone just attacked on this right away.
00:32:24.231 - 00:33:10.257, Speaker C: It was like, no way Peter Todd is satoshi. And there was, like, basically a ton of evidence as to why. And it's like, I don't even know how much I think HBO was even confident in their answer or if they just saw, like, a ripe market to get a lot of attention from. Because I think of this, right. And that they're, like, getting a lot of views, and some people may have subscribed to HBO Max literally just to watch this. But Peter's reaction was great. There's, like, a video circulating around, basically, where the documentarian came with her camera and was like, you.
00:33:10.257 - 00:33:12.953, Speaker C: You are Satoshi. And he's just laughing at him.
00:33:13.089 - 00:33:13.805, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:14.585 - 00:33:17.815, Speaker C: Next to him is also just laughing at him. Yeah.
00:33:18.155 - 00:33:18.947, Speaker A: So great.
00:33:19.051 - 00:33:46.517, Speaker C: But, yeah, difficult to basically come into a space full of people that largely identify with this project. Right. So many people identify with bitcoin and make it a part of who they are. And so many obsessed about this mystery. One of the greatest mysteries, I think, out there is who is Satoshi Nakamoto? And to think that HBO was going to come in and spend their money and basically figure it out. Yeah. It was ambitious, to say the least.
00:33:46.517 - 00:33:49.285, Speaker C: And the results are not. Not surprising.
00:33:49.445 - 00:34:07.677, Speaker D: I think you're right, Matt, that the splash value is what they're going for here. And there's kind of plausible deniability. Right. You can kind of throw out, this is satoshi, but there's no real way to prove it unless satoshi were to sign a message with their original address. And most people don't know that outside of bitcoiners.
00:34:07.701 - 00:34:07.789, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:07.797 - 00:34:35.825, Speaker D: And some bitcoiners might not even know that. So there's like, an information asymmetry there to where your audience, most of them aren't going to know that. So they're not even going to know that. There's a way to definitively prove this, but that's not really mentioned probably in the doc. And at the end of the day, yeah, they have the COVID of being like, this is who we think it is, but there's no real way to tell. So here's our guess and last thing I will say about the reaction, I think, you know, people being like, oh, it can't be Todd. He was 15 at the time.
00:34:35.825 - 00:35:02.117, Speaker D: If you do, like, semantic analysis of Satoshi's post versus Todd's, the writing styles are completely different. I think that's probably the strongest argument, because you could make the argument that, well, he's trying to change the way that he writes so that it might, you know, obfuscate who he is. But Satoshi was prolific online. There's no way he's always going to be able to. To alter. He's not always going to be thinking about that right when he's writing. So all that being said, the reaction of people being like, oh, it's not Todd was.
00:35:02.117 - 00:35:27.509, Speaker D: Was interesting to see. Like you said, there's kind of this groundswell of. And grassroots movement to be like, no, no, no. The other thing that I think was really important, too, with people's reaction to this, though, it's almost like in the. In the religion of Islam, where you're not supposed to show depictions of Muhammad, it's like, it's taboo to even try to address this at all. Like, doxing satoshi for the bitcoin community is. No, no.
00:35:27.509 - 00:35:54.927, Speaker D: It's a big sin. And I think that that was a lot of the reaction, too, that you saw from bitcoiners is like, irrespective of whether or not we think it's. Todd, why are you doing this? We don't want to know. You know, like, Charlie had a good tweet about this. It's like, ultimately, you shouldn't want to know that. And if you're trying to figure that out, you need to stop and reflect why you're trying to figure it out, because it has probably more to do with you trying to make a splash rather than arrive at some sort of truth. Right.
00:35:54.927 - 00:35:55.595, Speaker D: So.
00:35:58.065 - 00:36:13.873, Speaker A: Colin always brings the good rants, so I don't have much more to add to that. Maybe go check it out also. Go check out other block space media podcasts.
