00:01:53.400 - 00:02:08.992, Speaker C: Dot okay, welcome back to the mining pod. As always, you're joined by Charlie Spears of Block space Media and Matt Kimmel of coin shares. Welcome, gents, to the show. We are t minus like nine days from the bitcoin happening lot in the.
00:02:09.008 - 00:02:17.664, Speaker E: Pipeline for today I'm waiting with bated breath the heaven's gonna be fireworks on the night to me on the 20th I'll be the.
00:02:18.604 - 00:02:26.812, Speaker F: I'll be the pessimist. That's like. I feel like every having. It's. It's like the best thing ever. And then it comes. It's just as expected.
00:02:26.812 - 00:02:29.424, Speaker F: Normal. Just another block.
00:02:30.164 - 00:02:38.212, Speaker C: I'm trying to get excited for it but yeah, it's just. It's like a difficulty adjustment which we'll talk about in a second. It just kind of happens.
00:02:38.308 - 00:02:44.612, Speaker E: It's like maybe it's like that meme of that guy sitting his computer like this. And then block 840,000. Those up a little flag.
00:02:44.668 - 00:02:46.252, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:02:46.308 - 00:02:48.628, Speaker E: Maybe one of those things with runes.
00:02:48.676 - 00:03:09.314, Speaker C: Obviously it makes it a little bit more interesting for bitcoin miners. You've known about this for four years or whenever you have the bitcoin mining. If you just looked at the bitcoin difficulty chart so you know what's going to happen. But for happening day, we will have tons of content on block space media. So go to our YouTube channel. We will be live streaming. Live streaming.
00:03:09.314 - 00:03:27.274, Speaker C: Take that word again. The Denver bit devs happening party. So we're going to have tons of speakers. It's about 6 hours of content. We'll also be screening our new film, the big empty. So if you're in Denver, come and join us. If you are looking for something to do on the happening date, you can follow along on our YouTube channel.
00:03:27.274 - 00:03:48.210, Speaker C: We'll also have of course, lots of podcasts leading into that as well. Okay, let's go to our first topic for the day, which are going to go through a difficulty adjustment. We had our last difficulty adjustment before the bitcoin happening. And surprise, surprise, difficulty increased. Matt, I'll throw it over to you first.
00:03:48.362 - 00:03:59.454, Speaker F: I think miners are trying to squeeze out, make that last push, get that last bit of revenue before their production just gets cut in half. That's what I think.
00:03:59.794 - 00:04:22.920, Speaker E: Yeah. I think probably we say this a bunch on this show is that the hashrate we see today was set in motion months ago. So I look at what happened six months ago. Price is going up. So I think more capital into bitcoin, which is now realized in the hash rate and upwards difficulty adjustment.
00:04:23.032 - 00:04:39.120, Speaker C: It was a 3.92% increase in difficulty. Hash rate is now around 600 exahash plus or minus. Of course, just because that metric is sort of back backed out of transaction.
00:04:39.152 - 00:04:43.216, Speaker E: Speeds, that is crazy road to a zeta hash. Here we go.
00:04:43.360 - 00:05:05.650, Speaker C: You're moving quite quickly. Okay, we will not dwell on that too much bitcoin price. Keith's bounce around 72k. So we're looking at 424 bitcoin happening day and perhaps 69k bitcoin. So the jokes write themselves in this industry. Let's go over to bitfufu. Well, industry news, the only part that's.
00:05:05.682 - 00:05:16.050, Speaker F: Pumped harder than the bitcoin price over time is the hashrate chart. Yeah, it's crazy. Over 600 x ash. I'm still, I'm stuck on the last.
00:05:16.122 - 00:05:17.146, Speaker C: He's a fanboy.
00:05:17.250 - 00:05:18.170, Speaker F: Move on. Move on.
00:05:18.202 - 00:05:51.074, Speaker C: Well you know we, we love bitcoin on this show because you just pop out of nowhere praising it. Let's talk about bit foofoo, which is a sister company subsidiary. I don't quite know the relationship with Bitmain from our friends over at the miner mag. Definitely go check them out. And they went through bitfoo. Foo's believe is their q one report for how much bitcoin they mined 10,333 bitcoin for all 2023. And then they have 23 exahash under management.
00:05:51.074 - 00:07:06.048, Speaker C: The interesting thing here is the relationship with bitmain. And as we can see when we scroll through this report is that a lot of the revenue from bitfoofoo self mining operations are going directly to bitmain. Why is that? Well they're basically using a hosting model where bitfoofoo rents rigs from bitmain and then is sending a portion of those revenues back. The one weird thing about all this and why it's like really notable, besides the fact that Bitfoof, who is pretty large now 23 x hash puts that up there with the marathon digitals and clean sparks of the world is the fact that if you go and try to rent cloud mining with bitfoofoo, you're paying like an exorbitant cost for mining like uneconomical costs. So you see here on this contract for 180 days, if you're going to rent an S 19 XP, I think it's looking at like fourteen cents a kilowatt hour, which much money at that point. So it's interesting to see that they have not only a relationship with Bitmain and they're kicking back a lot of the revenue, but if you try to be a hosting provider with them otherwise, or be a cloud client with them otherwise, there wouldn't really be a reason to do it. Just when it makes sense from a money perspective, which makes you think about the relationship with Bitmain a little bit.
00:07:06.048 - 00:07:08.644, Speaker C: Charlie, Matt, any thoughts on this article?
00:07:09.464 - 00:07:23.672, Speaker E: It's not good to be locked into hosting contract after the having but it could be really good to be locked into hosting contract as price goes up. So you know it's going to get, going to get lean here in a few days.
00:07:23.848 - 00:08:03.958, Speaker C: My first thought on this is like if it was pricing out people from using its operations on purpose and that's from Bitmain is asking them to do that. That's like my speculation here could be wrong. If you're with Bitmain and you have thoughts on this we'd love to hear them. Bitmain also did have like a surplus amount of xps. That was kind of the word on the street and they started deploying them into especially North America over 2023 ahead of their S 21 series coming out. I think they deployed a lot of these through subsidiaries like Bitfufu or Bitfoofoo would be able to go and find places to deploy these units. Bitmain didnt really have to think about it because it was with a different company, different structure but they certainly got revenue back from this.
00:08:03.958 - 00:08:36.560, Speaker C: So I think thats basically the story with the numbers were seeing from this Q one and 2043 numbers is just like numbers on paper representing what the playbook was for bitmain during last bear market. Certainly a lot of revenue and I think just continues to show that bitmain is like the mega octopus when it comes to bitcoin mining. Reminds me of like the 1920s cartoons like standard oil with like its tentacles everywhere. Kind of bit bang. They have their tentacles everywhere.
00:08:36.752 - 00:08:45.214, Speaker F: If there's demand at 14, feel like I should start an operation out of my apartment, throw some.
00:08:47.034 - 00:08:48.054, Speaker C: That's a lot.
00:08:48.514 - 00:08:55.854, Speaker F: That is really high. But yeah, I mean I think the main takeaway is your point. The fingers of bitmain stretches quite far.
00:08:56.474 - 00:09:19.330, Speaker C: Yeah. For listeners who are not super familiar with bitcoin mining. Fourteen cents a kilowatt hour is probably about double what you should be paying if you are cloud mining or hosted mining. So you want to be around that. Seventy eight cents and even then it's like a little tough especially going to havening. Ideally you'd be under $0.06. So the fact that it's at means like something's going on with the relationship there.
00:09:19.330 - 00:09:45.554, Speaker C: Who knows what it is. Okay, we'll leave that story behind. We're going to stick with our friends at the miner mag though for the next one. They've just been, they've been hitting all the pieces lately. Aradyne New US based bitcoin miner just raised $80 million for its series B. They threw a little shindig party in New York this week celebrating the recent raise, a bunch of different people participated. But one familiar name from the last round is Marathon Digital.
00:09:45.554 - 00:10:16.724, Speaker C: Marathon Digital contributed 35 million in the series a. They also contributed in this round. I didn't see the amount disclosed. Perhaps I missed it. What does this mean? Well, we have more bitcoin miner manufacturers coming to the table and a lot of people in the US especially want to buy chips or complete machines from us based companies. This can also help when there's geopolitical issues, say if there's issues with Taiwan or, you know, there's an earthquake in Taiwan. We talked about that the other week.
00:10:16.724 - 00:10:23.184, Speaker C: This certainly nice to have a chip manufacturer here in the US. Any thoughts on this one?
00:10:23.344 - 00:10:55.308, Speaker E: I'm excited to see the duopoly change to a triopoly or quadopoly. I don't even know how it works anymore. But more manufacturers. I want to say it feels like this time may be different. This seems to have buy in from reputable, experienced operators, notably marathon. And this is a well capitalized company. And I have seen some reviews from some people, I think, who can be trusted that this is a performant machine.
00:10:55.308 - 00:11:15.892, Speaker E: So that's really exciting to see. And then very optimistic that it's manufactured domestically here in the US that cannot be overstated. Going into the latter half of this decade that we see another man, another ASIC fabrication and manufacturer stateside, they're claiming.
00:11:15.908 - 00:11:31.860, Speaker C: To have 200 million in sales already, like in the pipeline, which is a lot from the miners I've talked to. They mostly just have like test units. There's a recent test on a video by compass mining that I thought they did a good job with. Get you that on their YouTube channel.
00:11:32.052 - 00:11:32.944, Speaker E: And they got.
00:11:33.324 - 00:11:35.292, Speaker C: Dear Ash, my question back to you.
00:11:35.308 - 00:11:48.544, Speaker E: Is, like, do you think that's if they have 200 million in sales or do you think that's like public companies? Do you think that's us exporting out of country or do you think that's domestic sales from domestic manufacturer to domestic minor?
00:11:48.964 - 00:12:16.662, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's a fun thing with numbers like this when you're a private company, right? Like you can kind of say whatever you want, so it'd be cool. I hope they have 200 million in sales, like for them and that they're doing well. But I'd like to see some names of people who are buying them. To my knowledge. I don't know if any company is doing it. Maybe marathon has future orders on the books for this. But I have a hard time believing that cash has changed hands.
00:12:16.662 - 00:12:52.366, Speaker C: Maybe some cash has changed hands. Now that they have to build out units, right? And they say this at the end of the piece, quote, with this new funding, we'll ramp up production capacity and accelerate investments in our product roadmaps. That's from the CEO, Rajiv Khabini. So maybe they didn't need that funding and they, they kind of got that. Now the biggest thing I'm asking about is like the joules per terra hash. So the first units that did come out, I know they went to a few different mining companies and they got tested and they were not on spec. And there was apparently a second generation that was supposed to come out.
00:12:52.366 - 00:13:07.566, Speaker C: And it does look like it's more in spec. And so there was definitely marketed numbers and then real numbers that were not the same. And we've seen this with bitmain, we've seen this with Microbt and others. They do this. But what does this mean for our dying as well at the moment?
00:13:07.710 - 00:13:50.910, Speaker F: Matt, I'm glad you brought up marathon because I think it's really interesting that they are strong investors in this. Um, we've seen marathon basically, uh, try to get into like private transaction flow with their slipstream product. Um, now we see their investments, you know, not quite vertical integration, but. Right. They definitely have a strong relationship. Maybe they want some sort of private deals on an ASIC manufacturer level. Um, this isn't something that we've seen in the mining space thus far that I'm aware of because really the ASIC space has been dominated for so long by micro, BT and Bitmain.
00:13:50.910 - 00:14:32.828, Speaker F: So it'll be really interesting if Ordyne really does become another player. Being on us soil, I think is certainly an advantage because I think miners are very open to such close distribution and procurement. You made. It may be much easier from a supply chain perspective, and that might lower some costs or at least make logistics easier. But again, as Charlie brought up, this seems promising, but we've seen in the past things like this flop. Like intel tried a major corporation, they tried the ASIC manufacturing game. Highly competitive, very challenging to actually do.
00:14:32.828 - 00:14:45.802, Speaker F: This looks promising. I hope for the sake of really mining industry decentralization that this pans out. But the story is yet to be told. Well, to be told.
00:14:45.938 - 00:15:00.234, Speaker C: And marathon is also like the octopus, right? They got like slipstream, ASIC manufacturing, global mining, they got enduro. So they're also diversifying pretty aggressively, I should say.
00:15:00.394 - 00:15:27.866, Speaker B: Need ASIC help.

00:15:27.866 - 00:15:31.374, Speaker B: dot. When you think of ASIC repair, think vitamin.
00:15:31.674 - 00:15:45.592, Speaker C: Okay, let me click over to the next tab here. I think we're doing an ordinals corner with Charlie, so I'll pull that chart up and let Charlie riff on this topic. As always, I love this part of.
00:15:45.608 - 00:15:50.484, Speaker F: The episode where Charlie just goes off and we get to ask him questions.
00:15:50.984 - 00:16:54.480, Speaker E: I love this too. Okay, so I assume he's kind of a newer face of galaxy flexing into the ordinals research. Zach Picorni with, I think, a very, very iconic chart. A lot of the big question right now in the ordals market speculation scene is we now are seeing what you might call blue chip collections, collections and art and creators, which are iconic of the ordinal space. And the question is, okay, we can see what the market capitalization of, like classic blue chip nfts are. Are there analogies? How high does do these things go? We draw, you know, comparisons to the past. And what this chart does is Zach says, okay, let's look at some iconic collections, crypto punks and bored apes on ETH, and let's just choose what seem to be, you know, decent analogs, ordinal, Maxi biz and Nodemonx.
00:16:54.480 - 00:18:09.560, Speaker E: And let's just, you know, imagine like, let's see if they, if they map over each other as far as like, you know, overall market cap growth, price performance. And we can see there does seem to be some kind of fractal or, or kind of comparison here. And it, and it tells a story which reinforces what a lot of the ordinals believers, you know, sign on to, which is these things are going into the billion dollar market cap. So you can draw your price predictions from there. As we know, narrative is equally important to fundamentals in the speculative asset class. And I, one love to see it. I think the other part here is that this doesn't account for the fact that bitcoin has just a net larger market cap among just its entire asset class and the fact that there are some structural differences here where maybe ordinals are the actual real spiritual successor and solve some of the issues with nfts that are not actually existing on chain.
00:18:09.560 - 00:19:00.248, Speaker E: So I would love to see this data normalized for bitcoin market cap. I love to see more analysis performed from reputable teams like Galaxy Research. And yeah, this tells a similar story as a lot of the ordinals people have been saying, which is that it's still incredibly early in the price discovery for some of these. So I thought it was equally interesting which particular collections that the analyst Zach chose, nodemon, ordinal, Maxi biz, because that is kind of an implicit acknowledgement that those are like the iconic collections. So I think there's more. But I would probably also agree with his just intuition here.
00:19:00.416 - 00:19:58.282, Speaker F: This is a hype chart. This is this fuel that fuels the hype, fuels that's already existing, right. Extremely bullish. I want to point out that this is basically insinuating that the trajectory of ordinals could reach the same speculative fervor that came around ETH nfts in the previous cycle, which, if we remember, celebrities were buying. There was crazy volume. And I remember, uh, the top punks on ETH, which is the kind of, uh, peak, uh, collections, right. From, uh, at least price standpoint, or I guess floor standpoint, there were several individual punks sold for over $7 million equivalent per punk, right? So it's a pretty major, uh, money being sloshed around there.
00:19:58.282 - 00:21:07.874, Speaker F: Now, this hype was unwound at some point, but this is the hype chart, right? This is showing the on the way up part in that. The signal, I think, from Zach here is that there is a chance that there's more room to run for these collections. There is a lot of excitement around the halving, not just because it's the halving, but because there's the launch of these rune tokens, which Charlie has talked about a ton. And I'm not going to rehash the past, but there's certainly a lot of attention on these collections and kind of just a broader movement that's been happening that bitcoin hasn't really seen, I think, since kind of rare pepes, and you could go before that to some of the counterparty stuff. But I don't even think it's on the magnitude of the attention that there is now, because speculation has really just been so ingrained in the new culture, I think, of crypto, and crypto newcomers will, what do you think?
00:21:08.614 - 00:21:24.138, Speaker C: We're not seeing the other half the chart. We're only showing us the way up. So what happens on their side? I don't know. Kind of a cliffhanger. I think it's kind of crazy. I mean, Charlie was super early to ordinals. I started picking up on it, I'd say, like, end of February last year.
00:21:24.138 - 00:22:11.210, Speaker C: So, like, a month or two into, like, the initial hype. Um, obviously, like, ordinal theory had, like, existed before that, but it's to me, wild to look at a chart like this and think about, like, when the first collections were dropping and people were just kind of goofing around with it and what did it mean? And I was like, okay, this can never, like, kind of catch up to the ETH NFT wave, which was huge. I mean, at its point, at its peak, people were opening restaurants in New York for NFT holders, like, specific NFT holders, and, like, dedicated clubs, dedicated concerts. It was on Saturday Night Live. So, like, to bring that quote unquote culture back to bitcoin is certainly bullish for bitcoin bags. Uh, does it end in the same tiers as an ETH entity wave? I mean, yeah, probably it does.
00:22:11.402 - 00:22:12.162, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll just.
00:22:12.178 - 00:22:13.350, Speaker C: At least on bitcoin.
00:22:13.522 - 00:22:51.022, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm glad it's on bitcoin. Um, I have a hard time imagining on a long. The longer the timeline, um, I can't imagine these assets outperforming bitcoin, but that's more of a philosophical discussion on what, you know, what the nature of non bitcoin assets are. The other comment is, is like, I personally thought the NFT story as it mirrored last cycle was entirely played out. It's not played out. We can see this in the marketplace activity. And then there's a couple other interesting dials to turn which haven't been accounted for yet.
00:22:51.022 - 00:23:32.134, Speaker E: One is that bitcoins block space is finite on a rolling basis. So there is actually a limit to how many of these things you can put on a chain. There's not really a limit to how much you could put on ETH or Solana. There's actually a natural scarcity to bitcoin's block space, which constrains the future growth and addition of these assets. And then also because you have these crazy wealth generation events from speculation like runes and BRC 20, where does a lot of that speculative wealth flows to? Luxury assets. These are the luxury assets of choice. So lots of tailwinds.
00:23:32.134 - 00:23:45.104, Speaker E: I don't want to be holding these things and trying to speculate on them in 20 years. I want to own bitcoin in 20 years. But in the meantime, it's like buying a fun car.
00:23:46.284 - 00:24:16.044, Speaker C: I did have a tweet about that about two months ago, and I said, I hate to do this, but I'm going to do it. I thought it was a good tweet. It was like, the best way to accumulate bitcoin right now is through ordinals. Where you buy an ordinal, it's denominated in bitcoin. And over time, especially the next six to eight months, you're going to see that increase. So, like, one example is, like, bitcoin puppets a few months ago, people are just kind of laughing about them, or like, they're going to zero. Well, they're almost at, like, a floor price of 0.5
00:24:16.044 - 00:24:25.504, Speaker C: bitcoin. And for someone who's trying to, like, increase their bitcoin sack, not investment advice, but procure some JPegs, my friend, it is there.
00:24:25.964 - 00:25:08.038, Speaker F: Half a half a coin for a jPeg. Charlie just rolled his eyes so hard me out. I gotta. I'm gonna add the mining element to this, because here's the thing. If this does follow that curve, big if, big, major if. Not saying it's gonna happen, but if it does, like, some people are forecasting, like Zach here, what it means for transaction fees is a similar curve. Like, there will be a dramatic demand for bitcoin block space that I don't think we've seen before, because people are speculating on assets with a very finite bitcoin block space has finite supply.
00:25:08.038 - 00:25:40.344, Speaker F: Right? Very finite supply. The demand for these things could far exceed what is actually capable in these blocks. And, like. So you have to stack on top of the price of these unique sats or these jpegs that are attached to these unique sets. The price of the. Of that collection, of that set, plus the cost and the transaction fee, which could be even more, and could be. It's.
00:25:40.344 - 00:25:47.760, Speaker F: It's going to get wild out there. It's hard to honestly synthesize and piece it all together. Charlie, help me here. What do you.
00:25:47.792 - 00:25:48.088, Speaker C: I mean.
00:25:48.136 - 00:25:55.250, Speaker E: Well, it's like, people, we ask, like, who's the marginal buyer? Block space at a thousand sats for v byte? Maybe it's a JPeg.
00:25:55.432 - 00:25:56.846, Speaker F: Exactly, Preston.
00:25:56.870 - 00:26:31.672, Speaker C: So I think we've done this on the show before, and we will have this next week. We have a show with Parker Barrett going through q one bitcoin data, the French from coinmetrics. Great show. And we talked about block space and transaction fees and demand from ordinals. I think the long term perspective on this is, yes, there's going to be an increase in demand for block space because of inscriptions for now. But over time, it will go down to probably, like, a single digit or lower double digit percentage of demand for block space. Similar to what we've seen in Ethereum where they've had Defi and NFTs and ICOs.
00:26:31.672 - 00:26:59.306, Speaker C: And you get this stratification of usage for block space where every sort of application on that blockchain will at some point give a certain percentage of fees. I think that's what happens with NFTs and NFT trading on top of bitcoin. So for right now it's going to be pretty crazy. But there is precedent for this and over time it's calms down a little bit more and it's a nice little stat pattern, if you will, for bitcoin miners who want more transactions. Yes.
00:26:59.410 - 00:27:35.314, Speaker F: One of the major things that I have trouble with is if it's not on some second layer and everything is an on chain marketplace, which is the environment that we're looking at today. The liquidity of your assets is just not that great because you have the issue of waiting for bitcoin settlement process. Right. The ten minutes at least. If you have a high enough fee, you need a buyer on the other side and you need to pay that fee. All of those things impact the liquidity of your asset and that's kind of tough to overcome.
00:27:35.734 - 00:28:10.160, Speaker E: Yeah, I just, I'm still kind of amazed that this does mirror the NFT cycle of 21 and 22. I am surprised that we don't see structural changes in how the market delivers these things, but here we are. I do think that perhaps economic incentive will force the market to evolve and discover what kind of model actually makes sense whenever we talk about digital collectibles.

00:28:41.552 - 00:28:50.884, Speaker C: Okay, we'll go to the next and last topic for the day, which is Charlie going through a little bit of stuff on bitcoin pools.
00:28:51.344 - 00:29:44.864, Speaker E: Yeah, I think this is an underappreciated story this past month. If you go to mempool space, you have an easy chart to look at the mining pools revenues over the past month. And there's only one thing on here, which is the average block fees over the past 30 days by pool and if we see most pools are a little bit under what mempool up space, anticipated their average block fees to be by one or 2%. And then we see Marpool coming in at 12.5 above what mempool space would have expected them to earn in average fees per block. This is significant. What is marathon doing, which is different than everybody else right now? We've talked about on the show, they have.
00:29:44.864 - 00:30:29.220, Speaker E: They take transactions, nonstandard transactions, directly submitted through their slipstream API that nets them. They take a premium for that. And it's been a pretty modest premium, I think, but they now are more productizing it and increasing the premium as per like, rolling average block fee rate. And I think this is very, very significant. 12% above expected average block fees compared to everyone else, that is a very, very differentiating factor. And I don't think anybody's really let this settle in. This demonstrates that it's very profitable to do this.
00:30:29.220 - 00:30:38.972, Speaker E: And you have a clear market differentiation. Yeah, that's a pretty big deal to me. Also, zero empty blocks for the month.
00:30:39.068 - 00:31:29.714, Speaker C: Okay, got to ask it. When all these other pubco is going to launch their own pools, it's got to be pretty soon here. If they're looking at this, that'll be a fun thing to unwind or untangle that spool of threat, because a lot of these pub codes go to foundry. If foundry starts losing hashrate, then we have all these different pubcos going somewhere else or could go somewhere else. What does that mean for pool decentralization, especially with ant pool, which we talked about on the show with Parker, will come out next week, has so many ties to the f. Two pools of the world, the luxors of the world, the vipcs of the world. So what happens in a world where amp pools dominate the outside and all these pub codes are breaking off a foundry because they want to have more control over what they're going to do with their transactions scenario.
00:31:30.374 - 00:32:01.020, Speaker E: We actually do start transitioning to a fee. Fees, propelling, driving, minor revenue. Now, what is a 10% difference of what is maybe under 5% of your overall revenue? If that ups to 30% of your overall revenue per block and you are achieving 10% or higher above your competitors, this is now not just a modest differentiator. It is like the economic driver.
00:32:01.212 - 00:32:02.476, Speaker C: 12% is a lot.
00:32:02.620 - 00:32:22.968, Speaker F: I mean, then we have oscillating hash rate. You might switch off and switch on your asics between blocks based off of your mempool. This is a hot. This is a hot topic. The mining alpha part. The yeah, fee economics, like this is spicy stuff. It's gonna be.
00:32:22.968 - 00:32:35.392, Speaker F: I don't know if this continues out on a similar trajectory. I mean, these are gonna be the major kind of topics of the year. I think it's gotta be like either.
00:32:35.448 - 00:33:09.920, Speaker C: These pupco, the large enough pubcosity, create their own pools, like marathon, and I think it'd be naive to think that the other ones are not doing it. Or pools, like foundry, ocean, brains, wherever, allow a little more productization of what they're offering here, which is essentially packaging commodity and selling it to the market. And if they don't allow that, then I think the incentive is to create your own pool. A lot of the templates are out there, right? Like, it's not crazy to spin this up. There's enough people out there to be able to do this.
00:33:09.952 - 00:33:20.736, Speaker E: So I think I'm really excited to talk about this over the next year, because I think this will only increase in terms of just, like, interesting stuff to happen in the world of block space.
00:33:20.880 - 00:33:39.116, Speaker C: Okay, speaking of pools, Elizabeth Warren went to the woodshed on this topic this week. Let's take a quick listen to this and talk about how this very thing we're talking about here with pools and transaction selection is going to have implications in the political realm for bitcoin.
00:33:39.220 - 00:34:21.521, Speaker G: So validators are the middlemen between the payor and the receiver, and they help process crypto transactions. In the traditional banking world, if a bank transacts with somebody who's laundering money, then they are breaking the law. But validators in the crypto world don't have that same set of rules. Are there crypto validators right now that are processing transactions for North Korea and pocketing a fee for each of those transactions? Same for Hamas, same for drug lords and child traffickers?
00:34:21.647 - 00:34:28.885, Speaker H: There's reporting that I am familiar with that's public, about the fact that those threat actors that you've mentioned are conducting that type of activity.
00:34:29.029 - 00:35:15.400, Speaker G: Okay, so bad guys can use crypto right now because we don't have the right rules to keep them out. But I think it's worse than that. We know, for example, that Iran, one of Hamas biggest funders, makes millions of dollars validating transactions for others that have no connection to Hamas or Iran. So if I wanted to send $1,000 worth of crypto to you, mister secretary, is it possible that when I just send it just to send this, that Iran could be our validator and would be collecting a fee processing our crypto, all of that, without either one of us knowing it?
00:35:15.552 - 00:35:18.084, Speaker H: So, under a transaction like that is certainly possible.
00:35:18.384 - 00:35:49.796, Speaker G: Okay, so Iran, which is subject to all kinds of sanctions, is moving money through crypto and actually making millions of dollars validating crypto transactions for Americans and for everyone else, all because we don't have the right anti money laundering rules in place. One more quick question. If the crypto market grows and the number of crypto transactions increases, does that mean more money would likely end up in Iran's pockets?
00:35:49.980 - 00:35:58.132, Speaker H: Everything that we've seen says that when markets grow, threat actors use them more. And we should expect that that is what would happen here as well.
00:35:58.228 - 00:36:33.218, Speaker C: Trigger warning. Should put a trigger warning before putting Elizabeth on the show. So the thing here, I think, to pull out is when she's speaking about validators, I think she's also going to include minors. And, yes, that is how these systems work. Obviously, you have a neutral third party that has the ability to process these things. What does this mean, though, when we see these pool template wars that are about to likely explode? I'm just waiting for the day when Elizabeth Warren brings up ant pool's connections to CCP leadership. They'll find something, I'm sure.
00:36:33.218 - 00:36:36.654, Speaker C: Nothing that I'm aware of, but I'm sure they'll find something to connect it.
00:36:38.844 - 00:37:10.380, Speaker E: I'm surprised that she's starting to use some of the lingo. She certainly has her head wrapped around it enough to be dangerous. You do wonder if she. No, you don't wonder. She's clearly trying to launch an attack with no consideration for the merits of bitcoin in particular. Um, I see this as yet another shot across the bow. In fact, probably shot directly at the industry and trying to hit somebody.
00:37:10.380 - 00:37:15.024, Speaker E: So we have to figure out how we. We have to figure out how we respond to this.
00:37:15.444 - 00:37:19.504, Speaker F: Stay vigilant. The armies are growing.
00:37:22.124 - 00:37:24.584, Speaker C: What a sad note to end the show on.
00:37:26.324 - 00:37:28.144, Speaker F: It's just ridiculous.
00:37:30.234 - 00:37:49.786, Speaker C: Does not have time for it. Uh, we will pick up the political conversation again soon, I'm sure. In the meantime, get ready for the happening. We're excited for it. Uh, thank you for listening and tuning into the show. If you enjoyed it, please give it a five star review under podcast application of choice.
