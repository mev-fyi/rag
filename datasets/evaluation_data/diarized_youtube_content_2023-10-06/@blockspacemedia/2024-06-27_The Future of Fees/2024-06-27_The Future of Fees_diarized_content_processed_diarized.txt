00:00:00.280 - 00:00:07.254, Speaker A: This, this has, this phenomenon has emerged, you know, on ETh a long time ago. Right. And we can talk about eth here. Right. Like, this is not.
00:00:07.422 - 00:00:09.798, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, this is on the table. Yeah.
00:00:09.974 - 00:00:55.256, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, frankly speaking, we're going to deal with a lot of problems that, you know, other ecosystem mostly eth have dealt with. So I think, you know, it's very, very important for us to look at, okay, what happened there? What kind of solution worked? What kind of solution, you know, it's not quite working. So one thing I think people who are paying attention to this clearly feel, right, is that there are a lot more predatory activities happening on that pool now. There's a lot more sniping, there's more RBF. I think that generally just creates very negative externalities, leaking and spilling over to regular users, which is doing their thing. But back to your point, what really triggered this is that now we have different tiers of transaction preferences for transactions, different time preferences for transactions.
00:00:55.256 - 00:01:08.800, Speaker A: Some are much more urgent because the time value of those transactions, they loses over time. And if I don't capture this, it's gone. So I'm willing to pay much more. And as a result, the entire, the entire network had to suffer.
00:01:42.040 - 00:02:12.626, Speaker B: Welcome back to Bitcoin season two. I'm Charlie Spears, host of Bitcoin season two, which is produced by Blockspace Media. Bitcoin season two showcases new ideas from new voices on bitcoin. It's the technical and the cultural smashed together new discussion on the oldest blockchain because these are two is produced by Block Space Media. Make sure to check out our other content. The Gwart show, I highly recommend the mining pod. We have a newsletter that comes out on Mondays and Fridays.
00:02:12.626 - 00:02:30.550, Speaker B: Make sure to hit our website and see all things block space content. So today I'm talking with Liu Zhang, founder of Alchemia. Leo has written some of the foundational pieces on the commoditization of block space and I'm glad to have him on the show. Welcome, Leo.
00:02:31.650 - 00:02:32.898, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
00:02:33.034 - 00:03:00.080, Speaker B: Yeah, so we got to hang out a while in Hong Kong last month for bitcoin Asia. It was a lot of fun. We got to go down some rabbit holes. But you've been building towards launch this company, Alchemia. Can you just explain to me, talk to the structure of Al Camilla, what is it? What's the vision? How does it work?
00:03:01.540 - 00:03:50.196, Speaker A: Certainly, yeah. So I would describe Alkemia as the market of all on chain markets. So as block space is where everything has ultimately has to settle on and it doesn't matter if it's a simple transfer or nowadays these kind of men pulled sniping activities, getting more sophisticated, crazy rbfs. It doesn't matter how complex or simple these transactions are. Ultimately all of them have to settle on chain and all these surging demands to compete for a finite amount of resources, which is the block space. And block space, in essence, is the amount of full node resources you're purchasing to run your transactions, to purchase settlement finality. And that requires payments, that requires costs.
00:03:50.196 - 00:04:42.740, Speaker A: And this is something that affects every user who's using bitcoin. And you wake up and you want to just do a very simple regular transfer. But some crazy ruins collections happening. OKX is doing UTX or consolidation and there's a bug and has nothing to do with you. And you get hit with this impact, your transaction all of a sudden becomes five times more expensive to be completed compared to just a couple hours ago. So this is a very unpleasant experience for regular users, for service providers, who's conducting commerce is on chain. So a thesis that we have is that, yeah, with block space, it's kind of like the energy, right? It is the most fundamental commodity, most fundamental resource that powers the heartbeat of all public blockchains.
00:04:42.740 - 00:05:47.418, Speaker A: And given the dynamic of supply and demand, the supply doesn't really scale like once every roughly ten minutes. It doesn't scale that quickly based on the demand. But demand is very femoral. It can increase very, very quickly in a short amount of time. So that pricing of the access to this resource becomes a painful thing to every regular users who gets this negative externalities leaked on them, spilled over to them. So this has a lot of patterns, I guess, commonalities with how energy's market, commodities market has developed over centuries and in the past, this hasn't really become big enough for a problem because regular users, crypto and bitcoin hasn't become mature enough to sustain this, to justify this kind of secondary behavior. People are just using, you know, bitcoin for fun, for very, you can say, Dejins.
00:05:47.554 - 00:05:49.630, Speaker B: There are a lot of degens on bitcoin, right?
00:05:50.450 - 00:06:21.814, Speaker A: Yeah. So we want to create a market where they can capitalize on this impact, right? They can, they can trade transaction fees so that for regular, for commerces, for regular users, they can offset some of their costs incurred on chain with the volatility of transaction fees too high for miners. They can use this to capture some of the premium when transaction fee is being sought after. So that's the essence of, that's a very long winded way of introducing alchemy I guess.
00:06:21.982 - 00:07:12.470, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean you say you described like bitcoin's block space and bitcoin's femar kind of woke up this past year. So it's like very well timed. I know you've been building towards Alkemia for a while and you're reaching mainet. It's currently in test, it's currently in Testnet, but you float this early client type of almost like the ordinals or runes trader as this near present market participant who right now they need this type of product. What is long term the commoditization of bitcoin block space look like? Who are these clients? Who are the market participants? Like over the next maybe five to ten years, think long down the road?
00:07:13.410 - 00:08:00.718, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think if more commercial activities were to happen on chain, right, there would be more service providers, there would be more businesses that are built upon that emerge on chain. And so for them this become a very substantial cost of conducting business. They don't want this volatility. Similarly to Con Edison, you know, they don't pass the fluctuating electricity price all to their end users. So you're locking a contract to turn on your ac, turn on your light bulb, it doesn't fluctuate with the rest of the globe's usage. And these companies, these utility companies are able to do that by hedging on energy futures beginning of the month and lock in the average price for the next month or three months.
00:08:00.718 - 00:08:54.782, Speaker A: So in five to ten years, we expect this kind of behaviors to happen in crypto as well, where service providers, whether they're exchanges or sequencers for the roll ups or wallets providers or platforms that offer collections. So if they want to offer a very pleasant fee experience to their end users. And not to mention if in the future we actually bring social games, these kind of highly, highly active kind of interactions on chain, these are costly. You don't want to pass that experience, you don't want to pass that volatility entirely to the end users. So the only way to do that is through this type of hedging instruments. So that I expect is to, you know, I don't expect average users before they send, you know, a wallet transfer to hedge their transaction fee. I don't think that it's quite the case.
00:08:54.782 - 00:09:01.930, Speaker A: Similarly to, you know, today, average users, I don't hedge my electricity price. Right?
00:09:02.470 - 00:09:56.460, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't set up a synthetic electricity price contract every time you turn your light bulb on. You just expect it to be roughly x cents per kilowatt hour, right? Now, the current dynamic of bitcoin's fee market is very interesting. It's really fun to look at because it feels like it's waking up. It operates in these pulse events or event based fee spikes. Could you talk through this? I've talked a bit about this. I know you guys, through your social media, have described almost like post mortems on, here's what happened in bitcoin's fee market right now. Could you just describe the current landscape of these pulse based events? Maybe how alkemia fits into this model or can respond to these, how a user might, like, leverage that?
00:09:58.360 - 00:10:15.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I think waking up is the right word to use here because these things, they have always been happening. They've been happening since, you know, solicitation of nakamoto. It's just the kind of spiky behaviors. They're less pronounced. I mean, they were very pronounced for a period of time in the past. The congestions. This is not a new thing.
00:10:15.900 - 00:11:08.210, Speaker A: We have experienced, like, congestions multiple times in history, but there was just no good way to deal with it other than, okay, I guess we have to scale the, we have to scale the infrastructure, we have to scale the entire network now. And these things, they take efforts. Right? And I think scaling is something that will always happen and it always should happen, but scaling efforts, they require a long cycle of investment, long cycle of energy and efforts. So it doesn't quite necessarily solve the short term fluctuations. And in fact, I don't think it will ever will. Short term fluctuation is inherently a market oriented issue. So I think the reason people start to think, oh, we have more dynamic fee market now, one with having.
00:11:08.210 - 00:11:35.430, Speaker A: Now that fee is much greater percentage of miners revenue. Miners are much more sensitive to this. So miners are starting to think more about, okay, how do we capture fees more compared to in the past, where they're just sitting around? Because it's not really that big of a deal for them now. It's critical. It's critical. It's continued to become more critical. So that's why we see some of these out of end solutions, right? We see, like, more creative solutions of trying to capture that.
00:11:35.430 - 00:12:01.450, Speaker A: I definitely think that ordinance is, it changed things. It changed the bitcoin culture for better worth, but it definitely changed how people. It definitely changed the composition of the midpool. It definitely changes the weight of transactions that people are doing. And you can definitely. Mempool is much more full compared to the past.
00:12:04.510 - 00:12:36.860, Speaker B: One of the way I put is that previously you had just one type of transaction which users were using creating, which is just a normal financial transaction that wants to be included, have block inclusion in a certain window. But now we have a wide range of transactions with different urgencies to them. Or a person doesn't mind if their JPEG gets on bitcoin today, they just want it to be on bitcoin over the next month. So they have an entirely different time profile. So it's really interesting to look at this.
00:12:38.360 - 00:12:48.780, Speaker A: Yeah. And this phenomenon has emerged on Ethan long time ago. Right. And we can talk about youth here. Right. Like, this is not.
00:12:48.940 - 00:12:52.204, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, this is bitcoin on the table. Yeah.
00:12:52.372 - 00:13:26.622, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, frankly speaking, we're going to deal with a lot of problems that, you know, other ecosystem, well, mostly eth have dealt with. So I think, you know, it's very, very important for us to look at. Okay, what happened there? What kind of solution worked? What kind of solution, you know, it's not quite working. So one thing I think people who are paying attention to this clearly feel right, is that there are a lot more predatory activities happening on that pool now. There's a lot more sniping, there's more RBF. I think that generally just creates very negative externalities.
00:13:26.622 - 00:13:56.510, Speaker A: Leaking, spilling over to regular users who are just doing their thing. But back to your point, what really triggered this is that now we have different tiers of, of transaction preferences for transaction, different time preferences for transactions. Some are much more urgent because the time value of those transactions, they lose over time. And if I don't capture this, it's gone. So I'm willing to pay much more. And as a result, the entire network had to suffer.
00:13:58.170 - 00:14:39.550, Speaker B: Yeah. And so I'm not like really myself familiar with conventional commodities markets outside of oil. And I've not really studied derivatives. But I ask you how you think about alkemia. Are you trying to model this after other successful commodities structures? How do you, do you look at what has worked in history and you just say, what does this look like in the modern blockchain era? Like how, what are, what are similarities between existing commodities markets and alkemia?
00:14:40.890 - 00:15:04.200, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't say we're taking some orange trees playbook exactly here because I think it's quite different, especially for this is inherently digitalized. This is inherently, there's a production schedule of block space comparing to, I don't know, orange trees.
00:15:04.740 - 00:15:06.560, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great example.
00:15:07.060 - 00:15:43.920, Speaker A: Yeah. So it has some codified, not quite scheduled, but patterns to it. And these are things that changes how inherently this market works, how the supply and demand mechanics work. And these are things that we can't really escape from. So when we think about, okay, how we're going to design this, this market, because this is really kind of a secondary market on top of the activities that's happening on chain, like simultaneously. So when we think about that, we have to tailor a solution for bitcoin. We have to tailor something that's like inherently not too.
00:15:43.920 - 00:16:00.090, Speaker A: We can't just put, okay, this is what worked for oil. This is definitely going to work for bitcoin. In fact, we have tried multiple different solutions in the past and arrived at the current, uh, current version, which. Yeah, we're still experimenting.
00:16:01.670 - 00:16:41.160, Speaker B: Yeah. And so what, uh, it was, it was interesting because I, I've only kind of recently started thinking about these concepts. You have different types of like the financialization and commoditization block space. You have like physically delivered block space, which would be the block inclusion, the transaction inclusion into blocks of, and then you can create synthetics from that. And I haven't really fully thought through this question here, but what are your thoughts on, like, the differences between physical delivery and synthetic exposure? Like, what does this mean for users? What does this look like in the market?
00:16:42.220 - 00:17:06.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they're very different products, in fact. So even though it's. So this is actually a great example of how it differs from traditional commodity markets. Right. So even physically, oil versus paper oil, you're still trading on the price movement of thing. And of course, there's wide range of logistics issues that's introduced. That makes them very, very different, makes one superior to the other.
00:17:06.534 - 00:17:35.170, Speaker A: I think with bitcoin, the so called physical delivery block space is entirely different product that catered to entirely different type of users, comparing to paper block space. So first of all, what, who would want to use physical, physical divided block space? What does it really mean is that I want my transaction to be included in the first 20 of a specific block height for some reason. For some reason.
00:17:36.550 - 00:17:41.078, Speaker B: That was my favorite example anyway, so. Yeah, yeah.
00:17:41.214 - 00:18:32.178, Speaker A: So the reason is there's some like exogenous factors that had led me to want to purchase this. So this is more evident on Ethereum, again with PBS for MeV searchers. They would want to sequence their transaction in a specific order so that they can maximize the value capture. But that is entirely exogenous. It is, it is a behavior that's introduced like externally. So the reason I wanted it is because I want to capture that external opportunity. So for that, it's a very, very specific thing and it has very little to do with, like, oh, I want to earn fee rate.
00:18:32.178 - 00:18:51.370, Speaker A: I think that market activity is going to increase. That has very little to do with that. It has very little to do with hedging out my transaction fee risk. It's more about I want to capture that opportunity. My transaction needs to be the first 20 of the block. 146, three, two, seven, something like that. Right? Yeah.
00:18:51.370 - 00:19:16.912, Speaker A: Whereas for, if you're just trading this, if you're trading fee rate, that's entirely different consideration. So if I'm, you know, wallets, and I'm trying to compete with my competitors by offering a fixed, you know, withdrawal cost, I think river, or if I remember correctly, recently announced something like that, like zero fee withdrawal per month.
00:19:17.016 - 00:19:21.456, Speaker B: Yeah, they integrate something like that or something, but. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:21.528 - 00:20:03.060, Speaker A: But if, you know, let's say I'm a service provider, I want to offer this kind of, like, superior experience to my users, but I inevitably have to bear some risk. So in order for me to feel good about bearing this risk, or like, have some certainty on how much risk I'm bearing, I want to use these type of, like, financial instruments to hedge up my risk. So that's entirely a very different consideration because it sort of abstract out the whole sequence of transactions in a block or block height. These things don't quite matter for the context of trading synthetix, because all I want is if fear rate is going up, I'm taking a gain.
00:20:04.840 - 00:21:31.830, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting you brought up the example of wallets, and wallets may be competing on b rate because they're customers and users. And I guess I was comparatively recently introduced to the idea of the transaction supply chain, which I guess is a familiar concept in ETH. And in a way, wallets, particularly retail facing wallets, are the like are a core part of the transit action supply chain. And a lot of wallet people that I talk to are like, what? It maybe come to terms with the reality that what even is the wallet business? How do you make money off of it? Maybe your business model is that you're actually a transaction supplier. I know this may be the metamask model or some other, but I'm glad you brought up block space markets on ETH and Solana, and I'm also glad you brought up PBS proposer builder separation. I don't know if I feel that we have found a resolution, whether that was good or not. What are your thoughts on this? And does bitcoin experience something similar to PBS? Or how do we mitigate some of the negative externalities from that? It's a very open question on that topic for you.
00:21:33.130 - 00:22:21.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think the ETH community, specifically the researchers, have really arrived at a conclusion regarding PBS. With PBS, a very clear direction that it's trending towards, and frankly, people have warned about for years, is that the builders are highly concentrated and they're starting to verticalize. They're building their own relays. So there's just like a lot of efficiency you can achieve with centralization, with verticalization, with owning like different part of the stack. I think if we were, if we're, if we want to be super precise with the technicalities, there is like kind of proposal and builder separation. The mining pool is the builder, I.
00:22:21.612 - 00:22:24.720, Speaker B: Feel like currently has. PBS, in a way.
00:22:28.540 - 00:22:34.244, Speaker A: Was introduced like on bitcoin first, and we see this effect.
00:22:34.292 - 00:22:34.452, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:34.476 - 00:23:30.094, Speaker A: There's a lot, tons of centralized. There's also centralization on mind pool level. So PBS had already happened on bitcoin, and the builders have the equivalent of builder has already been centralized. And of course, the exact dynamics doesn't quite end, how the transaction flows from the search to builder. Two proposers doesn't quite work the same as on bitcoin. But the analogy is not what we're trying to talk about here, but it's more on what is the long term solution for bitcoin to combat mev and how to prevent that from leaking to average users. Unfortunately, I think in absence of fast iteration, I think this we, we're going to have to rely a lot on centralized service providers to try to provide a better experience on behalf of the users.
00:23:30.094 - 00:23:52.594, Speaker A: There's really, I think short term, that's the only way for them to do it. So, like magic Eden? Well, I don't remember if it's still the case, but I remember a while ago, due to people, their transactions couldn't go through because they get sniped left and right. So they offer some refund. Am I remembering this correctly?
00:23:52.702 - 00:24:11.850, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I don't know about the terms of refund, but yeah, there's, there's been people throwing stuff at the wall. As far as mitigation or compensation. Yeah, it does. It tends to, like, sniping tends to plague the ecosystem when, or the users, whenever things are going up, because snipers buy snipe low, sell high. So. Yeah, yeah.
00:24:11.930 - 00:24:44.626, Speaker A: And there's really not no good way to mitigate that. Right. Like, and frankly, you know, looking at some of the solution that, like, like ocean protocol. Come on. Thank you. How is this real? It's 2024. So it doesn't sound great, but I think short term, medium term, it is really up to centralized service providers to like how much of a better experience they want to offer their end users in order to stay competitive.
00:24:44.626 - 00:24:58.010, Speaker A: So if two equivalent services, one is offering some kind of compensation if their users transaction get sniped, the other one doesn't. It's just like, all right, okay, I'm going with this one.
00:24:59.190 - 00:25:34.324, Speaker B: Yeah. And this actually gets into a piece you wrote a while ago, I forget when, but the piece, things hidden since the foundation of block space. And you had a line in there, which is something like, Mev will keep growing in the future. I wrote it down. In the future, we expect the majority of block space will be filled with MEV activities. Block space is a new kind of market, a market of constant action, of waves and fades, of tricks and ruses. We're now starting to see this more at scale on bitcoin.
00:25:34.324 - 00:25:59.440, Speaker B: It's more of the power user driven Mev and not as much the block producer Mev. What are your thoughts on, because you wrote this years before ordinals and years before Menpo sniping was maybe commonplace. What are your thoughts on this now? Does Mev keep growing? Again, it's a broad category, but does toxic mev increase? Yeah. What are your thoughts on this?
00:26:01.180 - 00:26:33.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is a mev is. Is inherent property of how public blockchain works. I think as long as there's Manpo, there will always be me and be. And I, you know, people love to complain about this from a philosophical level, but frankly, I think this is. This is. This is not strictly worse, comparing to, you know, how Robinhood sells the transaction flow to a citadel. And they, you know, and you have nothing to do with it.
00:26:33.754 - 00:26:34.178, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:34.274 - 00:26:38.190, Speaker B: Unless you're trying to trade. Unless you're trying to trade GameStop. It's a wonderful user experience.
00:26:40.570 - 00:26:53.018, Speaker A: It does provide a much better, you know, user experience. But that's a. I think that's a slight different thing. I mean, it is the same thing, though. Like, it does. It does impact user experience. It does impact, you know, bitcoin user experience.
00:26:53.018 - 00:27:27.592, Speaker A: So, like, if you're just trying to do your thing and then fear just goes through the roof and it's like, what? Like, okay, I'm just gonna send someone. I'm just gonna send demo instead. You know, so I think it's not something that can be just easily overlooked because, like, oh, you know, this. This is some degen shit. Like, it's gonna go away. It's gonna go out of fashion, and I'm on my high horse just looking at my, you know, maxi tech. Right.
00:27:27.592 - 00:27:39.620, Speaker A: It's not. It's not going to play out that way. I think it's. It's very obvious. I think it's very obvious given, you know, the kind of shit that we see on.
00:27:42.280 - 00:28:41.670, Speaker B: The mempool. One of the catchphrases that I've seen is like, the mempool is a bigger marketplace than magic Eden. And it's kind of true. If you just think about the throughput of all of the. The activity and settlement through that, that is the ultimate final boss for just commoditization of this space. It brings me to another question, which is even though it feels like bitcoins fee market woke up this past year or so, if you still look at just the aggregate revenues of fees to bitcoin, it's still not a lot for a blockchain, which is the oldest 15 years out, where the whole point is that this is supposed to, I would hope, soon transition to a fee driven revenue towards miners at some point. You would hope that these actually gain a robust, dynamic market to them.
00:28:41.670 - 00:29:20.180, Speaker B: I look at Ethereum still consistently, dramatically generates way more fee revenue than bitcoin. Is fee revenue the only way to value block space? Or are there other components to this? Because I feel intuitively that bitcoins block space is more valuable, yet it does not generate as many fees as Ethan, do you agree with this? What are your thoughts on this? Like, why does bitcoin's fee market still feel relatively immature?
00:29:21.720 - 00:29:29.080, Speaker A: I think so. For this question I can give a marketing oriented.
00:29:29.200 - 00:29:30.580, Speaker B: Give me both answers.
00:29:31.360 - 00:29:47.356, Speaker A: Yeah. A more thoughtful answer. I think so. I think the to the moon answer is that, yeah, like, bitcoin has a lot of potential energy. Right. Dormant capital. It's been there for years and just waiting for the right people to unlock and it's there.
00:29:47.356 - 00:30:01.756, Speaker A: Look at the second best. Right. Like that garbage is able to produce so much activities. We can do it too. Right? And l two s are coming. Bitcoin season two is coming. It's going to unlock so much activities.
00:30:01.756 - 00:30:35.974, Speaker A: Bitcoin block space is going to generate so much revenue. It's just. It's going to happen. But I think the more the real. The real answer here is that it's very difficult to compare apples to apples. Right. It's not quite a direct comparison because if we looking at it from a pure financial lens, it is how much I'm spending to produce a block from a miners perspective and how much revenue I'm capturing that block in order to pay for my expense.
00:30:35.974 - 00:32:18.336, Speaker A: So I think there's the reason this calculus is because it involves so many moving pieces, because my cost is entirely incurred in the real world. I have to pay physical infrastructure, I have to pay for electricity, power, labor to maintain the machines, I have to pay, you know, big main or I have to pay shipping, I have to pay. There's just a lot like physical dollar denominated cost that's very difficult and evaluated over a long, longer period of time. Whereas for here, right, it's, okay, the probability I'm able to capture the next block or if, you know, fpps slightly different, but the spirit of it is the same. And how much fee is being packaged into this block? What is the dollar cost of this fee? Like how long, what is my holding period of these bitcoins? And now looking at the composition of the revenue, we start to think, okay, how much of the fee comes from ordinance activities? How much of that comes from, you know, runes and all these things, are they sustainable? Are they going to become lower? Higher? So I think comparing to something like ETH, where the feed market has been developed for a much longer period of time, it's really just a sheer amount of activities. And that introduces volatilities and introduces competition for the block space, which I think we're just beginning to see on bitcoin. So that's, you know, a very fair thing because fear rate is entirely generated by sort of the kinetic energy, right? Not the potential energy like bitcoin can have a massive market cap.
00:32:18.336 - 00:33:06.470, Speaker A: It can be the absolute unchallenged, you know, digital gold and everyone should love it, but it's very different from the connected energy, which is, okay, I need to move it, I need to use it to do all these things. So that scenario is we're just beginning to see or waking up to it. I think for miners this is starting to become less of. A couple years ago, a philosophical question of, oh, security budget is enough to sustain. Now. It is a real question. Miners should have vested interests to invest in things that produce more activities.
00:33:06.470 - 00:33:25.534, Speaker A: So back to your amazing tweet that summarizes really well. Miners are investors of ordinals. They just don't know it yet. In fact, I think miners survival are reliant on things that can keep producing activities. They want things to move. They want people to move this thing.
00:33:25.562 - 00:33:58.870, Speaker B: And that's, yeah, yeah, we pulled really far back. I want to tie it back in and wrap this up with back to Alkemia and your current intestine at phase. You've been demoing some of this tooling. It's pretty cool. I like to, I'm looking forward to delivery on Mainnet. Talk me through the current state of Alkemia and maybe what the path towards Mainnet launch looks like.
00:34:00.290 - 00:34:49.703, Speaker A: Yeah. So for those who are not familiar, you can check it out on Alkemia IO. The bazaar is live on Testnet right now. So you can long or you can take a long position or a short position on average transaction fee, average fee rate. So if you think that, okay, there's going to be another wave of ruins activities that's going to push up the fees. And if you are confident that, oh, this is going to be huge, then a very obvious way for you to capture that profit is through long fee rate or that helps offset some of your cost of being a degen. And if you think that it's overhyped and, and the fee decay is going to happen faster than people think, you can take the opposite side.
00:34:49.703 - 00:35:27.170, Speaker A: If you're a minor, you can take the opposite side to lock in your fee revenue. So these interactions are all possible now. And the Ui Ux is far from perfect. We're making a lot of rapid improvements to it. And hopefully next time people look at it, it's going to be much, much better and confident it will be. So we are launching in July on big net. And I think around the time of bitcoin Nashville, this will become more well known.
00:35:28.030 - 00:36:01.114, Speaker B: I think so too. Right now bitcoin fees are down, but we know if you've been here the past year, you know that you can feel it almost brewing just like another, another frenzied activity sometime. I don't know if it's runes driven or ordinals driven or some other degenerate speculative idea, but I look forward to getting totally liquidated on alchemy. I'm just kidding. I look forward to leveraging the product. I think it's really, really cool. It's about damn time.
00:36:01.114 - 00:36:14.700, Speaker B: We had options and ways to do this in the, the 15th year of bitcoin. We should have ways to hedge fees. So. Yeah. Anyway, any final thoughts, Leo?
00:36:17.040 - 00:36:33.032, Speaker A: Yeah, I think ultimately it comes down to, okay, more people are doing stuff with bitcoin. I think that's undisputed fact. And that's a good thing. That's what we wanted. So more people are doing things on bitcoin. They're moving. That inevitably leads to bitcoin getting moved around.
00:36:33.032 - 00:36:55.670, Speaker A: That creates more kinetic energy, that creates volatility to the feet rate market. That affects everyone. So I think this is something that we want to create an experience where people are protected in some ways or people are able to take advantage of it in some ways before this becomes out of control. The fear itself on bitcoin becomes out of control.
00:36:57.770 - 00:37:18.570, Speaker B: All right. You heard it. Thank you so much, Leo. I look forward to having you back on bitcoin season two. So once the fee market gets really heated and we can do maybe some live triage on what it actually looks like and what it's doing. So hopefully maybe. I would love to have that happen sooner rather than later because it makes for more interesting content.
00:37:18.570 - 00:37:20.150, Speaker B: Thank you so much for joining me.
00:37:20.770 - 00:37:22.170, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks for having me.
