00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.600, Speaker A: Welcome back to the mining pod. Charlie and Matt in the cockpit again in the saddle. Charlie is back, fresh from Amsterdam. We're going to talk about bitcoin price really today mostly got some good bull action, some bitcoin culture to talk about. Not a lot of mining news to be honest this week, like we'll touch on difficulty in hash rate and some ASIC prices, but there wasn't too much in mining news this week. And then we'll finish off with a mini masterclass from our very own Matthew Kimmel on Taproot assets, aka tarot, aka not tarot because that's illegal to say now.

00:02:30.976 - 00:02:39.360, Speaker A: Let's go first to this video from Larry Fink, which I think summarizes what's going on pretty well.
00:02:40.690 - 00:03:05.590, Speaker F: The rumor, I think the rally today is about a flight to quality with all the issues around the israeli war now, global terrorism, and I think there's more people running into a fight to quality, whether that is in treasuries, gold or crypto, depending on how you think about it. And I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight to quality.
00:03:05.740 - 00:03:06.920, Speaker A: That's pretty great.
00:03:07.470 - 00:03:33.460, Speaker G: Yeah, it's surreal to see Larry Fink saying that. I mean, we've heard him notably say during previous bull runs, bitcoin is a useless asset class. Bitcoin specifically, crypto, broadly. It's crazy to see him. And note this, this is during a bear market, so he doesn't have to talk about this. So this is very much a tone shift. A lot of people pay attention to this guy's words.
00:03:33.460 - 00:03:36.930, Speaker G: Yeah, absolutely wild. What do you think, Matt?
00:03:40.310 - 00:04:07.020, Speaker H: I'm all for more bitcoiners, right. Especially people that have influence to go on tv, know, powerful people with a lot of money that can impact adoption in a positive way. So, I mean, I'm all for it. I think there's some aligned incentives here. Obviously, there's the ETF filing. But I think also Blackrock has some ownership stake in some mining companies. Is that true?
00:04:07.390 - 00:04:49.506, Speaker A: Well, they passively purchase them through their funds. So somewhat, yes. I don't know if the entity, BlackRock itself owns them as much as their constituents who purchase into their ETS do. But yes, definitely like incentive aligned here. And for background, for those who weren't paying attention to headlines this week, the recent lawsuit between Grayscale and the SEC went in favor of Grayscale. And it does look like there's going to be progression towards an ETF because that ruling. So that ruling did not say that they can convert the grayscale trust into an ETF, but it did move them down the football field, if you will, to be able to get there a little bit quicker.
00:04:49.506 - 00:05:17.678, Speaker A: So it looks like by January 10, we may indeed have a bitcoin ETF, and it does look like they might just approve all of them at the same time. There's like seven to ten different applications out there. And why are they going to do that? Well, because first person who has an ETF is typically the one everyone buys into, and then everyone else is a lagger. And it's really hard to make up that market share. So if we have a lot going at the same time, there's going to be a lot of competition. Maybe one or two emerges like the top ones. But we're going to have bitcoin.
00:05:17.678 - 00:05:19.250, Speaker A: ETF is the highlight.
00:05:19.670 - 00:05:20.420, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:05:21.910 - 00:05:22.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:22.440 - 00:06:02.126, Speaker G: It seems like every ETF was like saying, oh, we're having progress in our discussions with SEC. Right. Mean, I remember Kathy Wood talking about the, you know, you look at what Larry Fink said, I'm a young guy. I don't have a lot of experience analyzing the kind of public statements that these guys make. But using the term flight to quality, that is very different than saying this is an interesting asset class or like speculative. It's like to be very specific about crypto being a quality position. That's wild to so very, very optimistic about those words.
00:06:02.228 - 00:06:06.206, Speaker A: You got to follow up on that with this Christian Lagarde video really quickly here.
00:06:06.308 - 00:06:32.854, Speaker H: Last thing I want to say about that really quick is that it's pretty clear that there was a ton of outside demand just like waiting for this ETF thing. Right. Like we got to mention the cointelegraph fake out, like a couple of days ago where bitcoin price went up. I think it was 7% in 8 minutes. It was like unreal candle, the God candle has returned. Right. And so while in the bitcoin ecosystem itself, none of it really matters.
00:06:32.854 - 00:06:54.030, Speaker H: Right. There's clear that there is a lot of investment capital out there that wants this to happen. And the price going up is just clear that a lot of people are making bets and now kind of thinking it's actually going to be a real thing. The options market is also going crazy, tilting to the call side. So we're getting kind of exuberant out there. It's going to be interesting to see how it plays out in the next couple of months.
00:06:54.100 - 00:07:05.782, Speaker A: Walk us through the call side thing there, because I for sure am not going to get that. But I bet some people in the audience might be interested in knowing those market dynamics and how that tells us where people are thinking bitcoin price is going to go.
00:07:05.916 - 00:07:12.722, Speaker H: Yeah. Someone placing a call option is basically just a bet to the upside on an asset.
00:07:12.786 - 00:07:13.158, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:13.244 - 00:07:42.240, Speaker H: And particularly there's, the three month contract is getting a lot of traction right now. And as you said, a lot of people are expecting there to be an ETF decision, possibly like one that actually comes to fruition in the January 10 range. And so if that's the case, it's about three months out. And so people are expecting when that happens, there's going to be a bitcoin run up. And so those options will help some traders make some money. And that's really all there is to it.
00:07:42.710 - 00:07:43.890, Speaker A: Are you betting?
00:07:45.110 - 00:07:52.690, Speaker H: Are you running? I am just a jolly old dollar cost averaging bitcoiner.
00:07:53.910 - 00:08:00.158, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. Dollar cost averaging bitcoin miner. My one s 19.
00:08:00.254 - 00:08:51.810, Speaker G: In Ohio, we always see, people are always like, oh, is this news bullish or bearish? And for the past ten years, it almost seems uncorrelated except by kind of what market regime we're in. Are we in bull or bear? Are we going up or down? And then whatever news it is, good or bad, it just caused the price to reflect up or down. To me, I see this, and maybe we're kind of becoming more locked into, I would say, like real news cycle. But I just see as I see people want to buy. People want to buy bitcoin, they're waiting for a reason, which is very different than people waiting to sell or being anxious about whether they should sell or not. It's been a while since we saw a discrete news story or discrete event, which caused a huge reflexive buy to the upside, which is very exciting.
00:08:51.970 - 00:09:22.302, Speaker A: Yeah, we got to bring up this Cointelegraph wic that you just mentioned. Irresponsible of us not to contextualize Larry Fing's quote within what happened there. So for those who are not watching Twitter this week, Cointelegraph put out a tweet saying that the bitcoin ETF was approved. And then they edited a few minutes later. We're like reportedly, but they were the ones reporting it. And essentially just they fell for a telegram or a Twitter screenshot to the effect that it was approved. That was not true.
00:09:22.302 - 00:10:01.690, Speaker A: But we did see bitcoin wick up to 30k really quickly. So you can see on the screen here, if you're watching on YouTube, just like pretty magnificent candle going up and then quickly retrace. Then Larry Fink goes on to, I think that was CNBC talks about it, talks about how there is interest right into moving to this market. This morning I had Morgan analyst on the interview portion of the show, Reggie Smith, and we talked about why an ETF matters for bitcoin. And his point was it's going to bring in so much liquidity. So even there, you can see the liquidity is coming. And we've had just two bits of ETF news this week, one fake r1.
00:10:01.690 - 00:10:30.040, Speaker A: And both have added some buying pressure to bitcoin. Let's talk about mining and then go to Christie and Lagarde because that Christian Lagarde video will pull up in a minute is pretty interesting. But I'm going to hand it over to you, Charlie. You talked a little bit about Luxor's RFQ model and how you guys are able to track loosely the pricing of ASICs right now as we're seeing a crazy growth in hashrate, crazy jumps in difficulty, and new ASICs coming to the market.
00:10:31.370 - 00:10:57.166, Speaker G: Yeah, so, I mean, hash rate is just unrelenting to the upside. We are at. I mean, what is it? The moving seven day average is at like 444 50. We saw a big upward difficulty adjustment. Six point something percent. And this is crazy. I mean, we're close to all time low in hash price.
00:10:57.166 - 00:11:15.250, Speaker G: We're at the low $0.06 or $60 per bad hash, depending on how you batch it. And so this is exciting. It's bullish for the bitcoin network. It's painful for our miners who are sweating right now. Perhaps for down, sweaty miners. Sweaty miners.
00:11:15.250 - 00:11:43.600, Speaker G: And I will point to our hash price index. We put out a piece on kind of ASIC pricing. This is one of my favorite kind of really granular looks into the actual pricing of rigs. And we're trying to kind of go a little bit deeper than simply a chart. And we're trying to add some dynamism to like. Well, okay, so there's a new hot ASIC, the S 21. It's a teens per terra hash, Jules, per terra hash model.
00:11:43.600 - 00:12:13.430, Speaker G: What does this do to the other asiCs? So we go in what's called. We talk about. And this is from Colin Kelly from Luxor. We talk about the bid ask gap, which kind of right there, it kind of shows you. It reveals a couple of things by model of like. So for the less efficient models, now we're going to call the less efficient the s 19 kind of vanilla class. Yeah, I know.
00:12:13.430 - 00:12:14.562, Speaker G: This is the new era.
00:12:14.626 - 00:12:15.846, Speaker A: I don't like hearing that.
00:12:15.948 - 00:12:44.320, Speaker G: I know. I don't like hearing it either. But this is the reality. We always got to go forwards with that. We've seen the spread bid, ask Delta or gap be a little bit to the downside. So the market wants to price these a little bit lower than people are asking to sell them. And that just says these rigs are older and you're only going to be able to hook them up to certain types of power.
00:12:44.320 - 00:13:49.318, Speaker G: But on that note, we actually see that being one of the actual s 19, not JRK, be one of the largest kind of, by volume that we sell from our desk, not just the past month, but kind of this past year, which shows like, there is demand for it, and perhaps you marry that with some very good firmware. It's just a very cheap priced rig. When the S 21 came out, the S 21 announcement came out that caused the 19 class to drop in price dramatically. I mean, we're looking at the well under $1,000 per rig now, which is very interesting. It allows, I think if you've got money, if you're one of the few people who has cash on hand and can deploy it, you've got a lot of options right now, which is exciting. I think we're in that stage of the market where there's multiple ways to deploy capital, whether you want to go super cheap on a specific model or you just want to like what I call having resistant S 21. Yeah.
00:13:49.318 - 00:14:14.110, Speaker G: So I think it's very interesting. We kind of try to provide some, I believe they're monthly insights to the rig market. But again, that's a small, little kind of cohort. Who cares about the rig pricing? But it is a nice granular look at what happened in the past few weeks as far as asics. Yeah. So shout out Colin Kelly from Luxor.
00:14:14.530 - 00:14:17.390, Speaker A: Shout out, Charlie for that awesome review right there.
00:14:17.460 - 00:15:02.362, Speaker H: Yeah, I thought it was an interesting article. I almost saw it as, like, when the new iPhone drops and everyone races to trade in their old iPhone and get the new iPhone, because another thing they mentioned was the increase in secondary market sales of the used S 19 class. It was kind of interesting. Like, the price drop comes with a lot of people selling them on the secondary market when this new S 21 comes out. And so you could see that people may be going to try to get the discounted S 20 ones and starting to get rid of the machines that they've been using in the S 19, the previously most efficient class. Right. But they have to lower their prices in order to actually get people to buy them, like, to get them out the window.
00:15:02.362 - 00:15:03.742, Speaker H: So interesting stuff.
00:15:03.876 - 00:15:12.160, Speaker A: Wind, titanium, Asic. Let's go to Christine Lagarde. I want to talk about this video. I've mentioned it like three times already.
00:15:13.270 - 00:15:58.480, Speaker I: The governing council of the ECB approved the opening of the preparation phase. It will be a journey, and we will walk the journey together with the legislator. All european institutions will be involved to make sure that Europe is equipped with the currency of the future. Cash is here to stay. You will have all options, cash and digital cash. So what does it mean for you, for consumers? It would be free and easy to use everywhere in the euro area. All of that, of course, is subject to the legislative process.
00:15:58.480 - 00:16:06.770, Speaker I: Cash or digital, the choice will be yours. Your euro, your choice.
00:16:07.750 - 00:16:10.930, Speaker G: Is that a threat? So painful.
00:16:11.430 - 00:16:11.906, Speaker H: I'm sorry.
00:16:11.928 - 00:16:13.234, Speaker A: I made everyone listen to that.
00:16:13.352 - 00:16:17.430, Speaker H: Went live and started attacking the Jedi council.
00:16:20.090 - 00:16:21.750, Speaker A: It was like, really painful.
00:16:22.410 - 00:16:29.660, Speaker G: I feel like she's making us an offer that we can't refuse. It's got your choice. Yeah, it's totally up to you, but.
00:16:30.990 - 00:16:33.450, Speaker H: Definitely Sci-Fi villain vibes.
00:16:35.150 - 00:16:52.910, Speaker A: Yeah. This is like, so painful to watch. Government official, obviously. So they're robots. But the point of it kind of goes back to the beginning of our conversation. Larry Fink is now interested in bitcoin. He's now arguing on behalf of a bitcoin ETF on CNBC and elsewhere.
00:16:52.910 - 00:16:59.682, Speaker A: Now we have the ECB deploying their digital euro. Like they're pushing forward with, like, the time is now.
00:16:59.736 - 00:16:59.954, Speaker H: Right.
00:16:59.992 - 00:17:19.250, Speaker A: And this happens right when hash price is really low. The market's really bad. A lot of people have been flamed out. We're in the depths of chapter eleven issues with so many different companies. FTX is going through its process right now in New York and federal court. This is the depth of the bear market. But we're now seeing the light on the outside.
00:17:19.250 - 00:17:23.370, Speaker A: And I just want to rejoice in that for a second because that's good news, guys.
00:17:23.440 - 00:17:34.060, Speaker H: Let's not pretend though, that CBDC announcements are like positive news attention for bitcoin. I don't know, devil's advocate there.
00:17:34.850 - 00:17:47.090, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe a discussion for another show. But I do think that is going to happen at some point. And then that does shed light more on bitcoin as being like an open and liberty free alternative, if you will.
00:17:47.160 - 00:17:47.730, Speaker H: True.
00:17:47.880 - 00:18:17.398, Speaker G: Although if they really wanted to shake things up, and I'm going to segue here, it'd throw everyone for a loop. If we issued a CBDC on taproot assets, this would cause the most crossing wires in everybody's head, I like to assume. I like to imagine the path of maximum pain, and this would be the most hilarious scenario. But then we saw this this week, right? And I mean, Matt, this is your domain.
00:18:17.574 - 00:18:18.566, Speaker A: Bread and butter.
00:18:18.678 - 00:18:21.482, Speaker G: Yeah, I'd love to hear you talk about taproot assets.
00:18:21.626 - 00:19:08.202, Speaker H: Yeah. In a nutshell, we're not going to get into the technical details of this thing, but it's basically a way to have multi asset bitcoin if you so choose to opt into it. So no base layer changes or anything like that. It's another symptom of the most recent software that everyone has come to love. Taproot, right, also spawned the ordinal ecosystem and all that stuff. What kind of makes, let's give some historical context, people have been doing multi asset things on bitcoin for a long, long time. But what makes this kind of different is it's basically trying to weaponize lightning on that front, right.
00:19:08.202 - 00:19:33.314, Speaker H: And lightning as kind of like the stacked layered approach on bitcoin that you can also opt into and send coins around at really fast speeds and for very cheap. Right. You think of being able to do that with stable coins and it could be attractive for a lot of people out there. Hence why chains like TrON are the.
00:19:33.352 - 00:19:34.420, Speaker A: Most used.
00:19:36.170 - 00:20:16.254, Speaker H: On a transaction number basis for stablecoins. And it's not happening on things on other chains that are more expensive, not as fast, et cetera. So it'll be interesting to see it's just a main net release. There's not like some crazy adoption happening on it yet. But this was kind of like something first released as an idea over a year ago and now seeing it on Main net, we can have a pathway to something like tether being on Lightning or as Charlie put it, a CBDC, which that would be. I'm going to pretend like that's honestly.
00:20:16.302 - 00:20:37.270, Speaker G: Not even an option actually in the tether leaving omnilayer announcement a few months ago, I think tether specifically referred, pointed out RGB as an attractive layer, which is kind of interesting. Full disclosure, I spent most of last night issuing a bunch of test RGB assets.
00:20:37.690 - 00:20:39.238, Speaker A: Now he's a whale and now he's.
00:20:39.254 - 00:20:40.620, Speaker H: Showing it on the show.
00:20:41.150 - 00:21:01.466, Speaker G: I own all the dumb tickers on the bitmask thing. Yeah. Anyway, I like to experiment. What we saw, and I will brings back to ordinals is regardless of. I mean I'm a well known critic of the BRC 20 standard. Just as a. It's got issues with it from a structuring and it's kind of a messaging layer.
00:21:01.466 - 00:21:39.722, Speaker G: It doesn't really make sense, but we see clear demand for shitcoin liquidity. I call it shitquidity. And sometimes this can develop into actual material assets on this chain. And so there's a cambrian explosion. I wonder if it's coincidental or kind of path dependent of why we got taproot assets, RGB assets. We have Casey building runes, we have BRC 20 a year ago today potentially type of thing. Yeah, exactly a year ago today.
00:21:39.722 - 00:22:10.630, Speaker G: This was not even a part of the discussion even really, I would say even fringe bitcoin narrative. And now it's everywhere you go and you see bitcoiners talking about it. You see new bitcoiners, you see everybody across the kind of bitcoin adjacent space all talking about. I'm very curious to see where this will the. We have demand and we have options. Now it's kind of which let the protocols compete.
00:22:10.970 - 00:22:25.420, Speaker A: I got a question for Matt for taproot assets. How does this benefit bitcoin miners? Or does it benefit bitcoin miners in any realistic way in the near future?
00:22:26.030 - 00:22:43.958, Speaker H: So I would say taproot assets is one possible path down a whole different kind of, like, gamut of potential options that could increase the amount of value that is happening on bitcoin settlement.
00:22:44.074 - 00:22:44.594, Speaker A: Right?
00:22:44.712 - 00:23:35.582, Speaker H: It comes back to an age old question of how could the financial system kind of be doctored to stack on top of bitcoin, right? And if more and more types of financial activity can settle down into simple bitcoin transfers, people will be willing to pay more in transaction fees. Right. They're going to be more economically dense transactions. And so if you're settling more value, people are willing to pay more in transaction fees. Miners will get more revenue from not the subsidy, not new issuance, but transaction fees, which is something that could have greater longevity as the subsidy is going down. You would want to see transaction fees to go up as a minor. Like I said, it's just one path.
00:23:35.582 - 00:24:06.114, Speaker H: Who knows if it's going to work out? But I think with all of these development teams trying to work on a way to have more assets in a better user experience, kind of cheaper, faster ways. Right. I think it's almost inevitable that we get some type of stablecoin, at least being able to be sent around on lightning in kind of like an easy way.
00:24:06.252 - 00:24:15.520, Speaker A: And what happens to our bitcoin culture built on top of DCA and bitcoin is the pristine asset. What happens to that.
00:24:17.250 - 00:24:20.560, Speaker H: Show mutually distinct. Why does that have to change?
00:24:21.490 - 00:24:49.574, Speaker G: I think they win, too. I think everybody wins. The more people using bitcoin, the more people win. Rising tide lifts all boats, even if we're pissing off the dock. This is just kind of how it's going to be. And the permissionlessness nature of bitcoin enables this, as opposed to constrains it. So I am looking for, I call it shitquidity, more shitquity on bitcoin.
00:24:49.574 - 00:24:59.434, Speaker G: I've embraced it. I've come full circle. I've been indoctrinated by the new group of people on bitcoin because I'm having the most fun I've ever had.
00:24:59.632 - 00:25:01.214, Speaker A: Any tickers we should buy?
00:25:01.332 - 00:25:01.758, Speaker G: No.
00:25:01.844 - 00:25:02.474, Speaker A: Just kidding.
