00:03:01.514 - 00:03:03.250, Speaker A: ETH Denver yeah, hi.
00:03:03.362 - 00:03:09.394, Speaker C: Thank you for having me today. It's great to be in ETH Danvers or BTC Danvers and being the mining pots.
00:03:09.434 - 00:03:10.130, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:03:10.162 - 00:03:41.250, Speaker A: When we took over returning the streets orange here. I like that I got you first and foremost in person. So I think this could be a better show than all the other ones because of that. But we are going to be covering much of the same ground. The difference being, of course we want to focus on bitcoin miners a little bit more. Which podcast is catered towards? We should start off with a bio. I think people who listen to the show regularly are probably know about chain way because I've been talking to you guys about you guys on the news portion of it, but on the coindesk feed, people might not know about you guys.
00:03:41.250 - 00:03:44.746, Speaker A: So bio and then let's get into what you guys have been up to.
00:03:44.770 - 00:03:45.970, Speaker D: And what you're known for.
00:03:46.082 - 00:04:17.796, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'm one of four co founders of Chainvale Labs and CEO. Chainvale Labs is the company building Citria, Bitcoin's first ek roll up. We actually co founded Chainvale Labs one and a half year ago. We worked on privacy, we worked on ordinals. Then for the last one year we were working on this project. It evolved a lot, but we started ideating and researching about this one year ago and today we have Citria announced and like getting lots of attention from the community as the short play of myself and the company.
00:04:17.940 - 00:04:19.836, Speaker A: What about yourself though? Like what got you into bitcoin?
00:04:19.860 - 00:04:53.794, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm an engineer, so I'm a computer scientist. I started working in crypto or blockchain four or five years ago. I was initially developing smart contracts on EVM chains, working with freelance or stuff. And previously I had experience in web development. I always had something with like utxo chains. I was building my own Utxo blockchain and like hobby projects and tried to add some functionality to it, like programmability. At that time I knew bitcoin, but I wasn't that interested because I didn't think there is something to build on bitcoin.
00:04:53.794 - 00:05:23.018, Speaker C: But last year I saw a casey's or nothing. And it was only hundred inscriptions in the main net. So even if we embed it to dived in like we had already node in our office. So we download our software, start indexing, and it made it to finish because there was only 100 inscriptions. Yeah, we tried to inscribe something and see, so it was too hard. So we started developing one of the first ordinal wallets, ordinal safe to make it easy for everyone.
00:05:23.186 - 00:05:30.146, Speaker A: So inscriptions really kicked a lot of things off. But before that, you said privacy chain ways. Focus on that. Was that bitcoin focused privacy or like.
00:05:30.170 - 00:06:04.704, Speaker C: Anything, you know, tony location? Maybe it's a privacy pool working on EVM chain. So it got sanctioned by like legal authorities in us. And there was a class of reaction from the community, including ourselves. So we started thinking, okay, what if we like, we can build a tool to use tornado cash safely. As far as proof of innocence, which is mainly you prove that you are not a sanctioned address, but you are not disclosing your address. It use zero knowledge proofs, recursive draw knowledge proofs. I think it was one of the top notch recursive ZK proof application at that time.
00:06:04.704 - 00:06:20.202, Speaker C: Yeah, it was like we already interested in privacy for too long and we saw the opportunity. It was fully public good, fully open source. We developed it integrated into several other projects as well. On evm chains. This was our main focus on privacy.
00:06:20.368 - 00:06:24.590, Speaker A: Then do you sunset that once inscriptions came around, or are you still working on that?
00:06:24.702 - 00:06:48.420, Speaker C: It was open source. We basically built it, left it to the community. We are not actively maintaining because it's one time protocol getting deployed on Testnet open source. And we left it at that. We also focused on that for a year. But with all the Citria work, it was too much work to do the BVM SDK stuff. We also sunset ordinal safe a couple of months ago.
00:06:48.420 - 00:06:50.616, Speaker C: So Citra is our own focus right now.
00:06:50.680 - 00:06:53.272, Speaker D: And so for these projects, do you.
00:06:53.288 - 00:06:54.392, Speaker A: Guys kind of think yourselves as like.
00:06:54.408 - 00:06:55.976, Speaker D: A hacker house where you're like being.
00:06:56.000 - 00:07:04.404, Speaker A: Able to move between different inscriptions privacy networks? How do you guys think about which projects you're going to work on?
00:07:04.904 - 00:07:30.098, Speaker C: Like once, while we are trying to find our company, which are my four co founders, three co founders and I, we were thinking about, okay, this should be like a venture builder. We should produce our own products in the markets. It was started that way. We were interested in privacy and only the caching happens. So I started working on it and we saw ornals. We started working on it and then we realized, okay, we know ZK very well. We know bitcoin script well.
00:07:30.098 - 00:08:07.690, Speaker C: So what if like we can combine these skills and make this inscription thing usable in defi and finance? The idea started in that way. Initially it was a Sorensee key roll up, which is kind of client side validated version of our roll ups. No BTC, but only meta protocols like inscriptions and BRC tvs. It was our focus back then. Thanks to Robin, he invented BitvM. And the day after we realized, okay, we can build ZK verifier in it and we can have bridge using this bit VM mechanism. And after that point, we were fully focused on this project and we are not doing anything other than this at the moment.
00:08:07.762 - 00:08:09.370, Speaker D: Gotcha. Okay, and we'll definitely get to Bitvm.
00:08:09.402 - 00:08:11.638, Speaker A: In a little bit. I wanted to have Robin on for.
00:08:11.686 - 00:08:13.990, Speaker D: Zero sync, and that was in November.
00:08:14.022 - 00:08:30.354, Speaker A: We were going to have him on and then he dropped the BitBM paper and he went viral and now his celebrity. So we even had him on yet. But one day we'll get him on, especially when it's a mining pertinent topic. So from, from there, you guys are focusing on rollups. Yeah, and ZK rollups specifically.
00:08:30.734 - 00:08:32.046, Speaker D: Tell me a little bit about why.
00:08:32.110 - 00:08:33.430, Speaker A: You guys wanted to focus on rollups.
00:08:33.462 - 00:08:33.726, Speaker D: What?
00:08:33.790 - 00:08:35.318, Speaker A: There's a lot of different scaling solutions.
00:08:35.366 - 00:08:37.001, Speaker D: Out there that are talked about.
00:08:37.137 - 00:08:38.553, Speaker A: Why rollups for you guys?
00:08:38.673 - 00:09:17.228, Speaker C: So like maybe we can divide it into two branch. One is like programmable, fully compilates programmable chains and the other is not programmable chains. So in the second thing, we have like lightning, we have like three k coins of Robin's proposal. And there's RGB, which is kind of programmable, but not that much. So we wanted to focus on something programmable because like we value BTC as the real currency, but without having an economy, we don't think people can acknowledge this as a real currency. So we thinking about building an economy and it should be programmable chain to build this kind of economy. So we went that way.
00:09:17.228 - 00:09:48.266, Speaker C: And since day zero, we knew that side chains are like float in design. They are, they cannot. In any case, they cannot get any bitcoin security, that's their problem. And much more important thing is they compete with bitcoin in the long term because they basically create an alternative lock space user flow into that way. And they pay to debt chains, miners and stakers. It doesn't anyhow benefit the miners bitcoin main chain. So we think that this design is not that great and not that efficient as well.
00:09:48.266 - 00:10:25.474, Speaker C: So we knew that we should use bitcoin block space to scale and like most effective way to do is basically the Kerala because it would take the execution from main chain. You batch them in like thousands of transactions in the ZKVM and generate a succint proof and put the proof inside the bitcoin blockchain so that you still have bitcoin as your source of truth. It also validates thanks to bitVm. But you basically use that block space efficiently so that you can do maybe ten times, maybe 100 times more TPs than the bitcoin main chain. With like little to no trade offs to bitcoin main chain.
00:10:25.934 - 00:10:31.794, Speaker A: Okay, so how did the ZK part come across for you from a developer standpoint? Like how did you get involved in the ZK space?
00:10:32.414 - 00:11:05.274, Speaker C: One of my co founders is a medalist in international Olympics and informatics. And my other co founder is like first international exam or so. They are very intelligent in math stuff. Once we started, we were all developers except one of my co founders that do like operations and business stuff. Murat Ekram was the medalist and Esat was our CTO. So they are very smart in mathematics and I was interested in protocol design. So we came up with this Ck idea of tornado cache, proof of innocence and acremy made it to catch everything up and started writing circuits.
00:11:05.274 - 00:11:26.412, Speaker C: I started to contribute to the circuits and the program as well. So in a shorter time we built this ZK. And after that point we knew we loved ZK and we only worked on privacy at that point. But we know how it scales blockchains from mega terms, landscape and also from other ecosystems. So we really love ZK. Working on deep math, working on ZK cryptography.
00:11:26.468 - 00:11:27.444, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay.
00:11:27.564 - 00:11:47.212, Speaker A: And so we'll go to BitVM in a little bit and talk about some of the foundational principles that you guys are using to move forward with this right now. But in terms of the business structure, you guys just announced that you closed a raise with Galaxy Digital, a few others, I'll let you get into that. Where have you guys been the last three months? And then post raise. Where are you guys at at the moment?
00:11:47.308 - 00:12:14.968, Speaker C: Yeah, the funding was completed late past year. So after the funding we managed like expanded the team. Right now we are twelve people, but back then we were only six people. Like four of us are co founders already. So we expanded the team and we still hiring people like especially the senior like protocol linears and stuff. So this funding enables us to make straight possible even more sooner. So we are working hard on productionizing our code base.
00:12:14.968 - 00:12:25.872, Speaker C: We will open source them in March. Maybe this will around the same time with this podcast. So we will open source our code base, we will reveal our bridge design and hopefully in Q two somewhere we will have testnets.
00:12:25.968 - 00:12:27.808, Speaker D: Okay, sick. Pretty cool.
00:12:27.856 - 00:12:28.840, Speaker A: Congrats on the fundraising.
00:12:28.912 - 00:12:29.736, Speaker D: That's big.
00:12:29.920 - 00:12:43.066, Speaker A: There's a few other competitors out there right now. Like how do you think about that landscape of different, whether it be like a botanics, which is more of like a multi six scheme, or there's other l two s out there. How are you thinking about like competitors right now?
00:12:43.240 - 00:13:25.086, Speaker C: So in scaling with like this kind of programmable chains, you need to consider two things. One is the security of the bridge and the other is the security of dial to itself. So let's talk about the oldest one, rootstock. Right? It is merge mind side chain which bridge the BTC with some multisig. So in the first assumption you are trusting the majority of multisig won't steal your BTC and in the second you trust that the merge miners don't steal your BDC on the side chain. So you have two trust assumptions which are pretty big. We definitely didn't like this model because of flow version of side chains and all the bridge mechanism.
00:13:25.086 - 00:14:12.128, Speaker C: So we kind of need to manage this trust minimize all of these aspects. So in the competitor landscape, Citria basically minimize the trust in breach because we use bit vm and what Bitvm verifies is basically all the ctria thanks to recursive Zk proofs. So bitfam verifies full citria history. So there can no block producer on the citria can steal your money because there is a zk proof for it. So l two trust assumption is already ignored in citria because there is no trust assumption on the l one, the bridge assumption we have bit vm and it allows us to have one of n trust assumption which basically if only one person in the committee is honest, then your peg is secure. This is like huge improvement over existing multisig schemes. You mentioned botanics.
00:14:12.128 - 00:15:09.870, Speaker C: Yeah, they are like large and distributed multisig, but it is still eventually honest majority assumption it's like you can stake Btc to join the committee like the multisig but honest majority of the multi sig must accept your btc into that multisig as well. So you have trust assumption about joining it is not permissionlessly joined. You have honest majority assumption to join and you also have honest majority assumption not steal your money and all the fees contribute on the side chain collected by the stakers, not miners. And why should miners still mine the chain then if we can eventually turn into proof of stake side chain? We saw this design and Botanyx was after I think our design resource done. So like we eliminate the trust in most of the case. So we think that this is the most effective and most trust minimized way to construct NL two on bitcoin today. Even like with a programmable way.

00:15:41.028 - 00:15:52.240, Speaker A: So let's go back to the other part. For the mining, it's obviously interesting for miners is like all these scaling solutions are very ephemeral. It's confusing which one's going to take off any of them.
00:15:52.392 - 00:15:53.328, Speaker D: But we can look at some of.
00:15:53.336 - 00:16:06.728, Speaker A: The base assumptions here and see which ones are going to be beneficial for mining. And you're saying something like botanics eventually all the flows from transaction fees are going to aggregate to the staking layer there as opposed to back to the L1 main chain.
00:16:06.856 - 00:16:10.152, Speaker D: So it's less interesting for miners, right?
00:16:10.328 - 00:16:21.884, Speaker C: Yeah, and less interesting to miners is equals to less interesting for everyone in bitcoin because it doesn't contribute to fees, it doesn't contribute to hash rate, it doesn't contribute to security, budget and long term security.
00:16:22.274 - 00:16:23.002, Speaker D: Okay.
00:16:23.138 - 00:16:26.534, Speaker A: Is there a way in which it's arguable that that's okay?
00:16:27.074 - 00:16:39.730, Speaker C: Obviously some people may accept this and go to Potanix and all the applications or even there if there's any. So. But I don't think this is a correct way of scaling and it's beneficial to bitcoin in the long term.
00:16:39.802 - 00:16:41.618, Speaker D: Okay, that's a really good point.
00:16:41.706 - 00:16:53.862, Speaker A: So citria or some sort of roll up scheme does enable that because you're bringing more throughput to the chain which brings transactions down to the main chain. Similar or dissimilar from lightning in the.
00:16:53.878 - 00:16:55.806, Speaker D: Sense that you're scaling.
00:16:55.990 - 00:17:31.534, Speaker C: Yeah, in lightning you also don't have this incentive align mechanism because okay, it's very cheap, that's good for users. But there is no fees collected for the miners and all the transactions happen. Let's imagine a world where every transaction is happening on lightning. You only pay to close a channel, open a channel line justice transaction. And these fees won't be enough in the long term for bitcoin. So our mental model is like l one must collect as much as fees as possible in the long term. But these fees should be devised as much as users in the l two or l three or on the l four.
00:17:31.534 - 00:17:36.094, Speaker C: And this is possible with recursion ck proofs and all this compression mechanism.
00:17:36.254 - 00:17:38.614, Speaker D: Do you think if we had roll.
00:17:38.654 - 00:17:43.402, Speaker A: Ups in 2015 when the lightning papers came out that it would have been a different world?
00:17:43.578 - 00:18:01.842, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. Like roll ups can, it doesn't have to enable programmable stuff. It can also have a payment roll up which is far more effective than lightning. No complexity of like routing. No. This kind of like two mechanism, channel mechanism, no inbound security. So I think everything will be better if you have roll up spectrum.
00:18:01.978 - 00:18:03.818, Speaker A: Interesting. And what do you think about people.
00:18:03.866 - 00:18:06.570, Speaker D: Pushing back on roll ups right now for bitcoin?
00:18:06.602 - 00:18:07.898, Speaker A: We're getting away from Citria stuff, but.
00:18:07.946 - 00:18:13.340, Speaker D: We'Ll get back into it in terms of roll ups versus lightning right now.
00:18:13.412 - 00:18:16.348, Speaker A: How have you seen that dialogue between two camps?
00:18:16.516 - 00:18:44.032, Speaker C: I think that's because of people mostly think roll ups. We are building an EVM because we care about economy. But some people in bitcoin may not care about that much. They just wanted to use payments, which is totally fine. But they don't realize they can do this on payment specific roll ups or lightning on top of roll ups. So you can even enable this kind of payment channel which more effective, like more less cost. And you can build this on an EVM compatible roll up.
00:18:44.032 - 00:19:11.844, Speaker C: So you don't have to deal with all the script complexities and bugs and software things and routing complexities. So once I think we will enable this kind of use cases, people will understand the value of rollups because you don't change the l one. Even like with the trust minimize way you don't. And if you want trust us. It is like some simple opcode. And once you go there, you can build anything because it's true, incomplete, and it doesn't affect the security of the main chain. This is a good way of scaling to our vision.
00:19:11.924 - 00:19:12.900, Speaker D: Okay, interesting.
00:19:12.932 - 00:19:14.004, Speaker A: Yeah, that was just like an aside.
00:19:14.044 - 00:19:16.396, Speaker D: Because there's right now a lot of.
00:19:16.420 - 00:19:17.852, Speaker A: Lightning devs who are looking at what.
00:19:17.868 - 00:19:18.916, Speaker C: They'Ve built over the last few years.
00:19:18.940 - 00:19:23.516, Speaker A: And I think they're getting a lot of pressure from the larger community. Like, why is this not working correctly?
00:19:23.540 - 00:19:25.580, Speaker D: And, like, I'm not one to cast.
00:19:25.612 - 00:19:27.532, Speaker A: Stones because I can't even, like, do any of this.
00:19:27.588 - 00:19:30.712, Speaker D: But it is an important conversation right.
00:19:30.728 - 00:19:32.152, Speaker A: Now between two camps.
00:19:32.168 - 00:19:37.600, Speaker D: So let's leave that aside and go to Citri itself and talk about what.
00:19:37.632 - 00:19:41.872, Speaker A: You guys built holistically. And then from there, we'll boot over back to the roll up conversation and.
00:19:41.888 - 00:19:46.524, Speaker D: Kind of like, take a 10,000 foot look from Citria itself.
00:19:47.544 - 00:20:00.808, Speaker A: Walk us through how it works from the bit vm standpoint on the security side, all the way through how you guys are architecting. Is this going to be open source so people can copy paste it and make their own roll ups? Are you guys trying to.
00:20:00.976 - 00:20:01.352, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:20:01.368 - 00:20:03.472, Speaker A: I'll let you go from there. But, yeah, starting with BitVM.
00:20:03.608 - 00:20:03.896, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:20:03.920 - 00:20:41.564, Speaker C: So maybe I can talk about the user flow in Citria from deposit to withdrawal. So you can understand the first of all, for example, you don't need to deposit to Citria to start. This is like something that is differentiated from lightning. You don't have an on chain transaction to onboard to Citria because it is just some EVM public key, which is corresponding private key. And you can just get this CBTC, we call it the citria version of BTC. It is one to one pack. So you can get this from someone else, you can get this from exchange, you can get this from onramp solutions, or you can basically atomic swap from BTC to citria to onboard the chain.
00:20:41.564 - 00:21:10.596, Speaker C: And you don't have to do anything else on the main chain by doing that. I think this is one advantage overall in one liquidity issues. And so let's say you want to deposit into citria one. The best possible way is to get your money from some friend or exchange because it doesn't require on chain transaction. But if you want to onboard your on chain BTC, then you can first automatically swap or deposit into BitVM. So bit vm bridge has some limitations. Maybe we can talk about in the BitVM section.
00:21:10.596 - 00:21:35.792, Speaker C: Yeah, but basically you lock your u two xo and request some signatures from all the verifiers and a pre image. This u takes you as two paths. You can get your money one week after or they, they basically move your funds into the multi sig, the Bitvm multi sig. So if they don't accept your money, you can basically claim your money. It is kind of atomic. So but basically they spend your money and they reveal a pre image. And with that pre image you basically mint your CBTC on the Citria.
00:21:35.792 - 00:22:31.062, Speaker C: And then you are good, you are onboarded into Citria and it's EVM environment so that you can enjoy all the existing toolings built for Ethereum for all over the years like Wallace, like exchanges and like lending protocols, bitcoin backed loans, bitcoin back stable coins, they can be all built on citria. So you enjoyed your time and let's say you did some transactions. And basically the sequencer, the party that do this block producing mechanism, produce blocks in every 2 seconds. So you get the pre confirmation. Then these blocks are batched together and proved in a process we call ZK proof. And there is a proof generated and inscribed into bitcoin with some sufficient data which we call state diffs. So basically if you are running a bitcoin node, you can just look at the transactions, scan the transactions and find this envelope, the inscription envelope inscribed with proof.
00:22:31.062 - 00:22:58.734, Speaker C: Then you can verify the proof. And if you can verify it and it matches with your local state route, then this means you are fully safe. You don't need to trust anyone else. So over the time we aggregate these proofs inscribed into bitcoin, which is in a recursive manner, so we can recursively verify all the CK proofs. And in the end we have a single proof saying that this is the latest canonical bitcoin proof of working below cash. And this is the roll up state route. So with that proof we can broadcast into our mobile phones.
00:22:58.734 - 00:23:32.550, Speaker C: So you don't have to trust anyone or launch a full note. If you have access to the latest bitcoin blockchain from your bitcoin light node or like some explorer, you are good to go. You don't have to trust anyone. And in the end this proof is verified in bitcoin, bitvm, in checkpoint transactions. So this enables withdrawals. If this proof is faulty then any verifier can put a flat proof and say that okay, this proof is incorrect or this is not the canonical bitcoin chain by just showing a longer proof of work. Yeah, so this is how Citria is secured by bitcoin and BitVm ZK proof.
00:23:32.612 - 00:23:54.322, Speaker A: Okay, let's go to the BitVM part. So for background BitVM, and we did talk about this on the podcast and like a news portion, but yeah, we haven't had robin on yet. BitVM is a novel concept for how we can make bitcoin a little more expressive in terms of like doing compute. That's as much as I will be able to say. What are you guys looking at with BitVM? What's interesting to you about it?
00:23:54.498 - 00:24:44.584, Speaker C: Yeah, so BitVM initially was the name of the paradigm that enables us to incomplete mechanism. So if you can like 100% assert that this computation is true or false, then you are good to go. It can be in single transaction or it can be via fraud proofs. So bit VM basically divides a program into chunks of scripts. Initially it was like the NAND gates stuff, the gate stuff. But later this change, I can talk about this and you basically in a very high level, chunk these things into merkle tree, like tab root tree, the leaves of the merkle tree. Then you get the root on chain and this, and you sign a series of pre signed transactions between the prover and the verifier, so that at any time prover shows a computation of chain.
00:24:44.584 - 00:25:38.504, Speaker C: Basically it says, I evaluated this function with this inputs and it returned true or false. And if you are a verifier and you agree with the results, then you basically cosign a transaction and there is no on chain footprint. This is the good part. And if you are not happy with this computation and you think it is faulty, or you haven't heard anything from the prover, you can basically force the prover on chain, either for revealing the impulse or showing like you can challenge the operator to show me this computation. Then he responds, then you show another, and he responds, you show another, and at the end you basically have an equivocation, which means that prover lies or you don't have anything else. And this means you uselessly use this mechanism to kind of make proverb easy. So in the end you evaluate this function, true or false, without computing all the transaction on chain, but dividing the result into chunks of fraud proofs.
00:25:38.504 - 00:25:44.444, Speaker C: With this way you can enable any kind of true incomplete transaction and computation.
00:25:44.604 - 00:25:49.232, Speaker D: Okay, so I'll put it my own word. So essentially you're taking some sort of.
00:25:49.428 - 00:25:57.848, Speaker A: Program or script or whatever, and you're breaking that computation up across different bitcoin blocks and then over chunks over time.
00:25:57.976 - 00:26:00.872, Speaker D: And then holistically combined, you look at.
00:26:00.888 - 00:26:04.272, Speaker A: That data and say, we can verify that a program is running correctly.
00:26:04.328 - 00:26:07.648, Speaker D: And then there's also a way to.
00:26:07.696 - 00:26:11.664, Speaker A: Prove that someone did something or did not do something with the fraud proof.
00:26:11.784 - 00:26:13.576, Speaker D: So this allows you to build a.
00:26:13.600 - 00:26:15.808, Speaker A: Program on top of bitcoin, because you.
00:26:15.816 - 00:26:17.992, Speaker D: Can not only run the program, in.
00:26:18.008 - 00:26:22.760, Speaker A: A sense, very limited program, but some program, and then you can prove if that action happened or not.
00:26:22.872 - 00:26:50.350, Speaker C: Yeah, you can prove that this computation is true or false. With bitcoin security, bitcoin's full hash rate, you don't have to encode everything in single script. This is the logic behind the BTM. You can divide the program into several transactions and several Merkel tree leaves so that you can succinctly verify this via fraud proofs. And eventually you still verify it. It is still bitcoin secured, but you did less transaction than you actually should do to compute that result as per.
00:26:50.382 - 00:26:54.454, Speaker A: Transaction, per block for what you're speaking about here, right?
00:26:54.574 - 00:26:54.846, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:54.870 - 00:27:33.644, Speaker C: There's like interactive challenge response game, which like this mechanism, it's a kind of tricky, and it can depend on the implementation, but there's no like official implementation. But Robin is doing his own bit game implementation in that it only gives you like seven days to react a challenge or show a challenge. So, for example, I challenge you and you have seven days to respond, and you respond, and I have seven days to challenge you and so on. Okay, so, and in their mechanism, they have 4 billion execution steps. This is like too technical, but it divides into 40 transactions on bitcoin. So in the worst case, you have to do 40 transactions to verify a bit VM program. But in the worst, in the best case, you don't have to do anything.
00:27:33.644 - 00:27:35.468, Speaker C: You just sign the transactions and go on.
00:27:35.556 - 00:27:41.788, Speaker A: And that's a big proven from November, right? Where like November, I saw something about, like the game could go on forever.
00:27:41.876 - 00:27:44.876, Speaker D: Like the fraud proof could take forever to. Is that right?
00:27:45.020 - 00:28:00.796, Speaker C: Like Robin figure out, we don't need to do this with gate. We can do instructions and we can fit more instruction to a single script instead of doing gates for every single script. So it basically reduced the number of Merkel leaves. And this means that it reduced the number of challenges. Sponsor game also.
00:28:00.900 - 00:28:04.730, Speaker A: Okay, now, how does Citria fit into this bit VM box?
00:28:04.922 - 00:29:01.684, Speaker C: So, like I said, bit VM have 4 billion steps that you can execute, and 4 billion is not that much for a computer program. So we basically built a ZK verifier running on bit VM so that we can now do anything, we can prove anything, it can be like the longest program on the earth, but you can still prove it and you can fit into a single succinct proof and then you can verify the proof in btw. So like I said, we aggregate all the CtrL proofs over the Bayes layer and then we built our own ZK verifier in c. Then we compiled into BitVMs instruction set in several steps. So right now Bitvm instruction sets can verify a Zk proof and by using that we aggregate Ctrl proofs and verify this in our program built in bit Vm. And then the result is either true or false. If it is false, verifiers can show you send an on chain transactions and show up fraud proof.
00:29:01.684 - 00:29:28.512, Speaker C: A disclaimer bit vm is not complete. BTM is proof of concept implementation. The off chain part is almost complete. The on chain part is still missing. So but we designed our Zk verifier like bit Vm is complete because we know the instruction set, we know how it is going to look in the end. So we immediately started working on it. Right now we have a of chain bit vm that can verify ZK proofs but don't change the scripts to show the fraud proofs.
00:29:28.512 - 00:29:29.848, Speaker C: And stuff is not done yet.
00:29:29.936 - 00:29:36.200, Speaker A: Okay, I was talking with someone yesterday et Denver and they said BitDm is trust minimize, not trustless.
00:29:36.352 - 00:30:11.730, Speaker C: Yeah, that's correct, because you need someone to show a fraud proof, right? If it doesn't require any product proof and you did computation all in once and it will be trustless. But in this case, for example, instead radar will be un verifiers which the number changed depending on the implementation. And if any of the unverifier is honest then you are good, which means you minimize the trust as much as possible. But this still requires the trust of one person among the community. So this is huge improvement over the existing multi seats which require the majority, but this is minority. It is not trustless, but it is the best construction you can do on bitcoin today.
00:30:11.842 - 00:30:13.826, Speaker D: Okay, do you think that fits bitcoin.
00:30:13.850 - 00:30:21.366, Speaker A: Zetos of like the l one? So multi sigs I don't think really anybody likes and we can see that because there's like a ton of multi sig applications for alt dudes that have.
00:30:21.390 - 00:30:23.910, Speaker D: Like really not taken off. People don't like it.
00:30:23.982 - 00:30:33.594, Speaker A: And the holy grail is some sort of two way peg where you can go in and out with BTC and not have to worry about anything else. Maybe you have to run another application, but it's trustless.
00:30:33.934 - 00:30:35.694, Speaker D: Do you think bit VM is good.
00:30:35.734 - 00:30:37.814, Speaker A: Enough or is it good enough for now?
00:30:37.934 - 00:30:42.860, Speaker D: In the midst of now we like.
00:30:42.892 - 00:30:53.484, Speaker C: 100% support ZK verifying base layer. Imagine a word like we have ZK verification on the bitcoin so you don't have to deal with any bips about opcos anymore.
00:30:53.564 - 00:30:53.868, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:53.916 - 00:31:20.220, Speaker C: Do you want cats? Just build a circuit for that and verify on bitcoin with CK Pro. Do you want Ctv do the same. You do want TX do the same. You don't need to deal with VIP's anymore yet. I understand it is very broad thing to introduce into bitcoin because it can verify anything. And if you are in terms of user it is like not a simple script. It's like some kind of offscaped because of CK proofs.
00:31:20.220 - 00:31:39.164, Speaker C: But in the long term I think we will find a way to make it all clear and introduce into bitcoin. But today bit vm is the best thing that we can do and it's a stepping stone for us to make Citria live show like what we can do with citria. Then people will acknowledge the need of trustless treasure so that maybe in the future we will enable this CK opcode.
00:31:39.244 - 00:31:47.724, Speaker A: How do you think this compares to ETH roll ups we've seen so far? Cetria specifically in this case, yeah, in terms of ethrolops.
00:31:47.844 - 00:32:26.194, Speaker C: In it we can use trustless ZK roll ups because the Bayes immediately verifies the ZK proof without having a fraud proof. But in bitcoin we have the bit vm. So we call this trust minimize ek roll up. It is not trustless CK roll up because it is not possible to do on bitcoin with this opcode. But it is trust minimized EK roll up compared to the Ethereum roll ups. In terms of security model, this is similar to a roll ups running live on ethereum which is called arbitrum which requires a committee to interact with the fraud proof today. But in terms of execution and working site, it is almost same with Ethereum ZK rollups except this PTM parts.
00:32:26.914 - 00:32:28.626, Speaker D: Okay, well let's go to Citria now.
00:32:28.730 - 00:32:32.454, Speaker A: Kind of expose like the foundations for what you guys are working on.
00:32:33.514 - 00:32:34.490, Speaker D: And I'm going to go back to.
00:32:34.522 - 00:32:48.922, Speaker A: Ethereum roll ups here. There's base, there's arbitrums. Starquare is doing something. There's a bunch of other ones out there. Seems like a lot of liquidity is fragmented. You get a lot of dapps built on top of these which are trying.
00:32:48.938 - 00:32:50.610, Speaker D: To figure out how to get them.
00:32:50.642 - 00:32:51.974, Speaker A: To speak with each other.
00:32:52.574 - 00:32:55.486, Speaker D: For example, if there's a program on.
00:32:55.510 - 00:32:57.838, Speaker A: Top of base, like a lending protocol.
00:32:58.006 - 00:32:59.222, Speaker D: And you want to move back down.
00:32:59.238 - 00:33:04.878, Speaker A: To the main chain, you move through base. But if you want to go from base to arbitrum, my understanding is that's not really figured out yet.
00:33:04.926 - 00:33:07.430, Speaker D: And so you have problems where prices.
00:33:07.462 - 00:33:20.534, Speaker A: Might be slightly different. That's not a huge issue. But the bigger issue is if I'm a user and I want to be able to move between these different roll ups, it's kind of annoying, especially if I'm in a lending protocol and I have funding on one side and I.
00:33:20.534 - 00:33:22.198, Speaker D: Have a loan on the other side.
00:33:22.206 - 00:33:37.634, Speaker A: So those kinds of things are still in the way, and I think those are being actively worked on. I think a fear for bitcoiners is we introduce a roll up. We have tons of different roll ups before we know. We have like huge, different wide ecosystem like we have with Ethereum.
00:33:38.374 - 00:33:40.634, Speaker D: How is that a problem?
00:33:41.014 - 00:33:42.038, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a problem.
00:33:42.126 - 00:33:44.950, Speaker A: Okay, what does that look like? How do we solve that problem?
00:33:45.062 - 00:33:51.674, Speaker C: Going into that? I will ask some question to you this time. So, yeah, drive chain, solve this. For example.
00:33:51.754 - 00:33:52.774, Speaker D: Oh, great question.
00:33:55.514 - 00:34:20.900, Speaker A: Is Paul going to listen to this podcast? That's the thing to think about. Yeah. I don't know if they necessarily would as much as just introduce other problems. I do think there's more mev because of the drivetrain world in terms of fracturing liquidity. I do think rollups introduce much more of a problem there. And drive chains would not because it does seem with drive chains you can.
00:34:20.932 - 00:34:23.100, Speaker D: Settle back down or just like interact.
00:34:23.132 - 00:34:24.332, Speaker A: With your onedrive chain.
00:34:24.468 - 00:34:27.556, Speaker D: But I'm not going to lie, I'm on this side of the mic, so.
00:34:27.580 - 00:34:29.476, Speaker A: You'Re on that side. So you have to answer your own question.
00:34:29.540 - 00:34:47.682, Speaker C: So in rollups, interoperability problem is way easier to solve because in drive chains, let's say you have ZK style drive chain that they implemented actually, right? Yeah, they have EVM style drive chain. And how can you speak among this like drive chains? You cannot, you have to get your BTC out domain chain.
00:34:47.788 - 00:34:49.854, Speaker A: Then you need to go to chain.
00:34:49.974 - 00:35:19.644, Speaker C: To what you described today in Ethereum altitude. Right. But in rollups, you can basically solve this with mechanism like called shared sequencing. And I will talk about our model to like have a scaling and interoperability. So we don't think there will be hundreds of roll ups on bitcoin to. Because bitcoin has like DA limitations, like a limit on the availability that you can use for megawatts per ten minutes, not that big. So we think that and BTM is also inefficient to use.
00:35:19.644 - 00:36:03.104, Speaker C: So if like you have low liquidity, let's say hundred bitcoin and network to use BitVM because it's expensive to like, it will draw on all the liquidity to fees and stuff. Yeah. So we imagine there will be couple of big roll ups, like Citria will pull out the liquidity. Then in there you will be deploying l trees and al four to share the security easily without going through all the BitVM process and expensive on chain transactions. And in that way, there are two things that we care. One is volition model, which basically divides the Citra into two in an interoperable way. So you still interact with the same application in the same UX, but applications have freedom to choose their data available to option.
00:36:03.104 - 00:36:29.212, Speaker C: So let's say you deploy some dex decentralized exchange, you can choose to where to put your data off chain or on chain. On chain is a bit expensive. Off chain is extremely cheap. So you can choose, and they are interoperable because they are in the same blockchain. They just send the data into different things. So with that you still have the benefit like thousands of TPS, extremely cheap transactions. But still bitcoin security because everything is still ZK pro.
00:36:29.308 - 00:36:29.772, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:29.868 - 00:36:58.174, Speaker C: So this is the one way of scaling and the other is fractal scaling. We call if you are developing some game chain and you don't like EVM, which is fine, you can deploy your own l three, you can use alternative Di layers, you can use bitcoin as da layer, you can use Citra as da layer, eventually boils down to bitcoin, but you can customize your execution. And in that we want to have this freedom that you can deploy your own sovereign chain. It doesn't have to be interoperable with others if it doesn't need this.
00:36:58.214 - 00:36:58.702, Speaker D: Right?
00:36:58.838 - 00:37:39.218, Speaker C: But the good thing is you can benefit all the things that is deployed on SRM so far, shared sequencing. It works on Citria because it's fully vm compatible. Other things like bridging layers, like aggregated layers on roll ups, you can put it on Citria because it works with CVM. I think that's the good thing with building Citria, because what Ethereum promised us eight years ago was like programmable bitcoin kind of thing. But now you have Citria, you can do everything that you can do on Ethereum, and it is using BTC and it has bitcoin security and it pays lots of fees to bitcoin miners. So you can benefit all the developments and you can enjoy the bitcoin security with BTC.
00:37:39.306 - 00:37:42.706, Speaker D: What's not to love if you guys.
00:37:42.730 - 00:37:44.054, Speaker A: Are going to get there first?
00:37:44.594 - 00:37:45.994, Speaker D: That kind of game plan right now.
00:37:46.074 - 00:37:49.034, Speaker A: Like the first roll up is the one to win.
00:37:49.154 - 00:38:04.140, Speaker C: Yeah, not for the win. To be honest, it is not that easy job. If you deploy the first and you are done. It is not like that. But on the execution, we are very competent team on development. I trust my team so much. But on the execution side, we are working hard as well.
00:38:04.140 - 00:38:45.730, Speaker C: We are working with all the projects to come back to bitcoin. Like use bitcoin back stable coins, bitcoin back loans and also we want to flourish our own ecosystem. And we have some crazy ideas. Like Citria is running on bitcoin, has trust access to bitcoin. So why it cannot act as a Dex between RGB and taproot assets? Why you cannot build a wicked staking PTC providing liquidity to lightning network on Citria? Yeah, like there are crazy things that you can do with Citria because it's running on bitcoin, with bitcoin security and it has trusted access to bitcoin data. So we are working towards it and being first is not that important for us. It is just something that we're proud of.
00:38:45.730 - 00:38:59.070, Speaker C: We will come first, we believe, but it is not something that allows you to win. We are working on execution, we are working on technical developments. So it will be the most secure to that you can do everything. That's the promise.
00:38:59.182 - 00:39:00.262, Speaker D: What do you guys get out of.
00:39:00.318 - 00:39:05.262, Speaker A: Being one of the first ones? Like what's the motivations? And for background for listeners, a lot.
00:39:05.278 - 00:39:08.846, Speaker D: Of these l two s optimism, well.
00:39:08.870 - 00:39:18.510, Speaker A: Not base, arbitrum, star, they've all launched their own tokens. Is that something you guys are interested in or is there other ways that you guys are looking at? I mean, you have to run a business as well.
00:39:18.542 - 00:39:25.522, Speaker C: So, yeah, so we think that bitcoin on like if there is any other token like stacks, it competes with bitcoin, right?
00:39:25.578 - 00:39:25.906, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:39:25.970 - 00:39:50.914, Speaker C: So we are committed to use BTC in anywhere. Like deposit BTC, it's the native token on the roll up, you pay the block space for BTC because it also boils down to the DA. So we are not having enough plan to like launch our own token, like promise a token or like point. Lots of bitcoin altos today do like multi seq deployment and promise. Tokens and airdropsets. Excuse my language, but it's bullshit.
00:39:52.054 - 00:39:56.754, Speaker A: You're allowed to speak your mind when it comes to we do on the show.
00:39:58.254 - 00:40:38.418, Speaker C: So we don't think this is a correct way of building an l two or bootstrapping an ecosystem. We care builders and we want applications first. Then it will attract the liquidity and users from bitcoin based chain and they will all use BTC. So technologically, today, we don't need a token, so why not launch a token, right? Yeah, it is useless. If there is any point that a token can be useful, then we think it is not that important to launch a token. If there's a decentralized exchange on Citria and they need a token to coordinate the security or governance, okay, they can launch a token, whatever. But as Citria, we are using bitcoin as our native token and we are proud of it.
00:40:38.546 - 00:40:39.466, Speaker D: Love that. Yeah.
00:40:39.490 - 00:40:44.004, Speaker A: A lot of other teams are not doing that. And I wonder.
00:40:44.944 - 00:40:46.384, Speaker D: I wonder whether that's going to be.
00:40:46.424 - 00:40:50.112, Speaker A: Like this cycle or are you seeing it right now?
00:40:50.208 - 00:40:52.016, Speaker D: A lot of L two RC 20 is.
00:40:52.040 - 00:40:58.808, Speaker C: There was kind of meme tokens, but then some parties claimed that, okay, we developed this PRC 20 because it contributes.
00:40:58.856 - 00:41:01.584, Speaker D: To development of this kind of finding.
00:41:01.624 - 00:41:07.588, Speaker C: Like ICO or IPO, but if technologically you don't need the token, it's useless. Yeah.
00:41:07.636 - 00:41:10.492, Speaker A: And I think a lot of the BRC was stuff was just like complete.
00:41:10.508 - 00:41:13.300, Speaker D: Shenanigans and just goofballs.
00:41:13.332 - 00:41:29.144, Speaker A: People figured out a way to tokenize something. Um, and so it's kind of fun, but it's mostly. It's really died out from what I've seen recently. Like, the volumes are not there really there. I'm sure it comes back as like, markets pump. Let's go to, um, opcat, OPc TV covenants. As we kind of finish up here.
00:41:29.144 - 00:41:33.252, Speaker A: What would you like to see as a bitcoin builder?
00:41:33.348 - 00:41:49.204, Speaker C: On top of bitcoin, there are like ZKP. Obviously I talk, but it's a very long term goal. But in short term, I support cats. It's very simple. Ten lines of code. And it was in the beginning of bitcoin. I care about community feedback.
00:41:49.204 - 00:42:13.792, Speaker C: We must think every aspect of it. But over the years, I think we already think it's like. It's the endless process. We can't think 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, but it doesn't have an end. So we research about this for like years. People talking about cAt, implementing cat applications on bitcoin forks and stuff. So we think that from my perspective it enables lots of things with simple opcode change.
00:42:13.792 - 00:42:50.074, Speaker C: So I support Cat on CTV and TxH. To be honest, I am not perfectly capable of saying that this is better than this in that covenant aspect. But to my knowledge, this kind of covenants makes VM extremely efficient. All this pre sign project process because you basically pre sign to emulate a covenant in most of the times. So CTV and TX solves both. But from Robin's comments, like I said, I'm not the expert on that. He says CX hash instrument allows much to do with BitVM.
00:42:50.074 - 00:43:11.228, Speaker C: So I'm not kind of supportive of both because I still not competed about the pros and cons that much. But I support some kind of covenant which community and I in the future will research and think about it. But in the near term I think ket is the most simple thing and it's the most powerful thing that you can enable and build some coherence even. Right.
00:43:11.396 - 00:43:12.572, Speaker D: Let's bring it home to mining as.
00:43:12.588 - 00:43:16.036, Speaker A: We, as we finish up marathon this.
00:43:16.100 - 00:43:21.146, Speaker D: Last week announced it's merge mine L2. So I think it's a lot like.
00:43:21.170 - 00:43:35.242, Speaker A: RGB or something like that. I haven't looked into it too much, but just a merge mind chain, it's obviously broken through. Like whether it be ordinals that cause it or whether it be drive chains like this. Bitcoin tech talk that normally gets kind.
00:43:35.258 - 00:43:37.962, Speaker D: Of shoved aside is now like permeating.
00:43:38.018 - 00:43:40.170, Speaker A: Into other corners of the bitcoin ecosystem.
00:43:40.202 - 00:43:41.494, Speaker D: For the first time in a while.
00:43:41.874 - 00:43:50.584, Speaker A: How do you think this progresses from here? Where are we going to go? We're going to see more mining pools jumping in on this? Are we going to see some of these bigger companies that have.
00:43:52.644 - 00:43:53.596, Speaker D: Large bitcoin.
00:43:53.660 - 00:43:56.972, Speaker A: Hodls start pushing for different updates?
00:43:57.108 - 00:43:57.804, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:57.964 - 00:44:24.140, Speaker C: So like in our way, like we talk about proof of stake side chains, right? They don't benefit to miners and emerge mining. They kind of benefit to miners from out of the band. But bitcoin today is governed by pools, right? Not individual miners in most cases. Do we know this? Like pools share all the merge mined revenue to all the miners and how we can like make it accountable without running to side chain nodes and accounting.
00:44:24.212 - 00:44:26.108, Speaker D: Yeah, we know they don't because of.
00:44:26.116 - 00:44:28.140, Speaker A: The stack stuff that's been happening last year.
00:44:28.172 - 00:44:29.024, Speaker D: Right. So.
00:44:32.644 - 00:44:53.346, Speaker C: Yeah, so in merge mining, I don't support out of the bank payments. So I got in protocol fees. I want to show in the, I'm full explorer. I want to see in my bitcoin notes. I want to see which alto paid more fees to miners. So we, I support this kind of in protocol thing. In protocol fees like roll ups and other solutions similar to that.
00:44:53.346 - 00:45:15.940, Speaker C: I don't support out of the bank payments, to be honest, because it also doesn't solve anything about egg problem and stuff. But yeah, that's aside. So I spoke with several miners like in Denver or before. Most of them are like thinking, okay, we basically care all the like, we do the hardest thing of bitcoin and we have lots of miners as a pool and we don't want to hurt anyone.
00:45:16.012 - 00:45:16.476, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:16.580 - 00:45:43.088, Speaker C: If we introduce something like controversial, then bitcoin can result in some reworks or stuff. We don't want to break this thing. We want to keep bitcoin going. They are not people focused on the consensus nodes are most important. Miners obviously important in a sense that they keep the bitcoin running, like going into social concerns and stuff. So I think most of them are neutral. They support anything that they gain.
00:45:43.088 - 00:45:43.616, Speaker C: Fees.
00:45:43.720 - 00:45:44.404, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:45.144 - 00:45:46.896, Speaker C: Like unlike ocean or stuff.
00:45:46.960 - 00:45:47.604, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:48.144 - 00:45:52.712, Speaker C: But the marathon thing, I don't think it's something novel or different.
00:45:52.808 - 00:45:53.392, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:53.528 - 00:46:04.882, Speaker C: That's their way of doing business. I respect, but I don't think it is something usable or benefit to miners other than their merge mind facilities, maybe. That's my view, basically.
00:46:05.058 - 00:46:05.650, Speaker D: Gotcha. Yeah.
00:46:05.682 - 00:46:17.058, Speaker A: Miners are interesting because they're both interested in gaining more fees and having more adoption of bitcoin and bitcoin projects because it affects their bottom line, especially with having coming up.
00:46:17.186 - 00:46:18.618, Speaker D: But on the flip side, they also.
00:46:18.666 - 00:46:27.892, Speaker A: Have like these very structured businesses. Like, you know, they have gap reporting standards. They're listed on these major exchanges. And so like, they're much more grown up than large parts of the ecosystem.
00:46:28.018 - 00:46:29.040, Speaker D: And so there's both like a very.
00:46:29.072 - 00:46:32.512, Speaker A: Conservative nature of miners, but then there's also like this flip side where they're.
00:46:32.528 - 00:46:34.160, Speaker D: Like, we want to.
00:46:34.232 - 00:46:35.764, Speaker A: Yeah, they need to explore.
00:46:36.064 - 00:46:40.240, Speaker D: And I've more or less found that it's like every other miner.
00:46:40.272 - 00:46:43.120, Speaker A: Like one minor will be very conservative. The next one is like game to.
00:46:43.152 - 00:46:46.244, Speaker D: Kind of experiment a little bit, which is interesting.
00:46:48.304 - 00:47:08.228, Speaker C: If everyone supports ordinals, it's no good. If everyone support, doesn't support ordnance, it does not good either. So I kind of support their neutrality and I think that miners should behave economically. So they shouldn't think about like, this is good, this is bad. If something pays fees and if it's consensus for it, then there's no problem to my eye.
00:47:08.316 - 00:47:08.812, Speaker D: Definitely.
00:47:08.908 - 00:47:13.948, Speaker A: Okay, where can people reach out, find out more about Citria or if there's miners, what's the message towards them?
00:47:14.036 - 00:47:42.916, Speaker C: Yeah. So for contacts, you can visit our Twitter citria xyz and webpagestitrail xyZ. And I'm zero x orkun in Twitter. So maybe you can just attach this to somewhere. So if they have, like, mining facility and trying to work on some collaboration, that we can increase the fees, or we can have like some kind of collaboration, they can reach out to me and also application builders, if you have some critical application and some crazy idea on bitcoin, please reach out.
00:47:43.060 - 00:47:43.548, Speaker D: Love it.
00:47:43.596 - 00:47:45.444, Speaker C: Thanks for joining today. Yeah, thank you for having me.
