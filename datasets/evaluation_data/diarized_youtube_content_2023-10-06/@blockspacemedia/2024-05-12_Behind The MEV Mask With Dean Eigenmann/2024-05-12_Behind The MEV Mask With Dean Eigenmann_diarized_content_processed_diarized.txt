00:00:02.080 - 00:00:28.084, Speaker A: Gorgeous show is sponsored by Ellipsis Labs. Ellipsis Labs is building a world where mainstream finance happens on chain. Their first product, Phoenix, is a fully on chain limit order book. Dex on Solana, doing hundreds of millions of dollars in volume with 100% unincentivized users and liquidity. I know this team personally. They are one of the strongest teams you're going to find, and they happen to be hiring engineers right now. If you're passionate about Defi and interested in building something sustainable in this space, visit ellipsislabs XYZ or find them on Twitter at ellipsis underscore labs.
00:00:28.084 - 00:00:48.200, Speaker A: Hey, guys. I'm here today with Dean Eigenman. Dean Eigenman is an MeV searcher well known in the space, has a lot of very interesting thoughts on the MeV landscape, and it'll be interesting to learn from him. So welcome, Dean.
00:00:48.352 - 00:00:49.360, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:49.552 - 00:01:26.682, Speaker A: Okay, well, where should we start? I think. Okay, what do you see at the mev landscape right now, just like, when you're looking at the game, I think so you were on a podcast maybe six months ago. It was really good one, and you sort of gave a lot of interesting, I think, thoughts on where you think Mev is largely headed, and I just like to know what you see currently. I mean, you could talk about Ethereum specifically or other chains or just, like, what we're seeing evolving, maybe, sort of, if you want to introduce yourself a little bit as well, and kind of what you guys do.
00:01:26.778 - 00:01:59.438, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the last podcast, when we. When we spoke at. Spoke about Mev, we were, like, still very. It was very early in the BSC stage, and, you know, things have, like, all the. All the tooling that you have on Ethereum has kind of, like, it's come to the rest of the ecosystem now as well. And so you get the long tail maturity across the space.
00:01:59.606 - 00:02:03.314, Speaker A: So do you focus mainly on BSc still?
00:02:05.054 - 00:02:16.278, Speaker B: Yes and no. We still focus on EVM heavy chains, and we focus on chains where. Where fees are low.
00:02:16.406 - 00:02:42.498, Speaker A: Okay, so you tweeted maybe four months ago now, and you said the entire MeV market is bound to become a wholly vertically integrated oligopoly. We are less than six months away from this reality. Where are we right now? What do you see? Do you see primarily vertical integration? I know there's a lot of discussion about vertically integrated searcher builders right now. Would you say we're at that stage? Nearing that stage?
00:02:42.666 - 00:03:19.884, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think we're at the cusp of that stage. Teams are kind of merging you know, builders are running searchers are running validators and stuff like that. And I think that's the natural way this entire game plays out, right? If you have the capabilities to view the market in some holistic way, then you're going to take that opportunity.
00:03:19.964 - 00:03:47.080, Speaker A: I don't know. Maybe this is more of a subjective question, but how bad do you think builder, maybe just specifically with Ethereum right now, how bad do you think builder separation is? Or, sorry, builder centralization? And how big of a deal is this? A lot of people have sort of contended that block production will become centralized, and ideally, validation verification will be decentralized. I mean, how big of a deal do you think it is that Beaver build is building 40% of the blocks now?
00:03:47.232 - 00:04:35.952, Speaker B: I think all the MeV solutions which have, they've just kind of created a more centralized system. Every MeV solution just kind of bubbles the, the layer, it bubbles it up to the next layer of the stack, right? So like, oh, before you were playing in the mempool, now you can't play in the mempool anymore. So you're like a validator and blah, blah, blah. And so it just, like, it's just recentralizing the mempool. So I feel like a lot of the things that are created to solve MeV actually make it a worse status quo or make it worse than the status quo.
00:04:36.128 - 00:05:19.574, Speaker A: Do you think that, do you think that the design of PBS proposer builder separation for Ethereum? So right now we have these trusted relays, right? And a lot of builders are building with mev boost, which is this flashbot system. Do you think that the design implementation of PBS has been like, well, let me ask you in this another way, and this is coming from the another side as opposed to the mechanism designer. You're the actual, you know, you're the searcher, you're the, you're actually the one using these systems on a daily basis. Do you think that this could have been implemented better? And like, what, what do you think went wrong? If, if you think that this centralization sort of is an issue that, that we've been discussing, I don't know, like.
00:05:19.734 - 00:05:53.292, Speaker B: You know, it's always, it's always, it's always easy to, from the sidelines, say you could make a better market. I don't know what my solution would have been to, to how blocks are built currently and things like that. I think Ethereum's current solution probably works. My main goal is bringing the efficiency to users. And so if that's with these new models, then sure.
00:05:53.428 - 00:06:30.344, Speaker A: Do you think that enshrine PBS or sort of the, some of the designs that have been put forward thus far, like, do you think this is feasible? Because, I mean, right now we have these trusted relays, right. And it's sort of the idea is to keep the builders from duping validators and the validators from duping the builders. Right. So it's sort of like this intermediary. And do you think that like enshrined, like, first of all, are we actually making progress on something of the sort? And is this something that is really possible in practice? I don't know how, how closely you follow some of like the most recent Ethereum, you know, proposals and whatnot.
00:06:30.884 - 00:06:47.276, Speaker B: What do you mean? Like, I think, I think the way, the way things are done right now, it just results in a bigger group, bigger cabal. Right. Like, yeah. Block builders and relayers and. Yeah.
00:06:47.380 - 00:07:06.464, Speaker A: Do you think that we're working on now, or. I say we are. I'm not working on this, but do you think that people who are working on this in terms of like enshrining these relays, like, is this possible and does this help? Maybe that's a better way to ask. I mean, is this something that can help? Or is like, is your opinion sort of that this cabal is set in stone and this is the direction we're headed?
00:07:08.404 - 00:07:32.950, Speaker B: I don't think it's set in stone. I like the nice thing is that, you know, market participants are able to join and leave very free willingly because of the decentralized nature. But like, yeah, there's going to be, there's going to be a huge capture of that that occurs.
00:07:33.142 - 00:07:40.670, Speaker A: When I heard you before talking, you were talking about atomic strategies versus non atomic strategies. Atomic strategies, you're taking on inventory risk. Is that correct?
00:07:40.782 - 00:07:42.966, Speaker B: Atomic strategies, you're not taking on inventory.
00:07:42.990 - 00:08:04.394, Speaker A: Okay, sorry. Okay, so non atomic strategies, you're taking on inventory risk. And so is this part of what you see with these bigger builders like Beaver and Rsync, they're able to take on this inventory risk because they have a lot of these assets on their balance sheet. Right. Is this what you see as driving a lot of the centralizing forces?
00:08:05.014 - 00:08:52.925, Speaker B: Well, that's essentially cool, right? The way you bring efficiency to all of these markets is like when you're decentralized clearinghouse, right? You have an overall, you have the entire market, and you're able to take on certain risk, like inventory risk, because you know what's going to happen, because you know you've predicted that. Yeah. So, so like, non atomic strategies are, will be, I think, in the future, the main strategy, like the long tail strategies that are atomic are gonna, like, fizzle out, and most strategies will end up being non atomic strategies.
00:08:53.069 - 00:09:28.234, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. And that also sort of reinforces the idea that there's this, like, growing cabal that continues to eat up. Are you concerned? Okay, so, like, pivoting a little bit. Are you concerned? Well, maybe not you, but how do you see censorship with this? The direction we're headed? Like, is this a big concern? Do you see the censorship? Both of maybe the OFAC type censorship, but then also just being able to censor transactions if you're a big builder, is this concerning, or are we converging on some equilibrium that will find a steady state?
00:09:28.614 - 00:09:42.374, Speaker B: There's an interesting. The whole censoring transactions is kind of interesting because you, first of all, you don't know if a transaction was censored versus if it was just missed.
00:09:42.494 - 00:09:43.154, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:48.374 - 00:10:26.904, Speaker B: I think that builders shouldn't censor any transactions. Obviously, that's my idealistic view. I also have to sometimes deal with the lawyers who tell me what I can and can't do. Um, I feel as though on a long enough time scale, there will be enough or there will be sufficient validators who are, um, maintaining a certain level of benevolence. Um, and so not censoring any transaction. So just including what they see. Like, bitcoin miners have kind of done this for a while, right?
00:10:27.324 - 00:10:55.018, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. In fact, like, there's been pushback, I think. Like, marathon mining pool was censoring for a short period, or they. I forget exactly what, what they were doing. I don't want to, I don't want to misquote, but they were, they had an OFAC list. And then more recently, there was a pool that was censoring, which was kind of interesting. It was hard to, like, it was the, the mempool kind of had to be reverse engineered to figure this out, but they were probably filtering some of fact transactions, and you.
00:10:55.018 - 00:11:30.270, Speaker A: Yeah, there was, like, some social pressure, and then they said, okay, we're not going to do this anymore. But, you know, as, like, these systems grow, like, as governments become increasingly aware as to what defines censorship. And, you know, do you actually have the ability to exclude versus, you know, include transactions? Like, it's. It's certainly a question. I think that with Ethereum, you know, like, the biggest builders, um, well, two of the biggest builders are censoring, and then there's one sort of benevolent builder, if you will. What you see as, like, the current state of geographic distribution. And then also, like, is, how important is this becoming in your mind?
00:11:30.422 - 00:11:42.758, Speaker B: I think it depends on the strategy. You know, for market making strategies, almost everyone is. It's the Tokyo AWs data center. Because all the exchanges are there.
00:11:42.886 - 00:11:43.878, Speaker A: Right, exactly.
00:11:44.046 - 00:12:32.004, Speaker B: Like, we, you know, we. We have a very good process on collocating with nodes that we know are miners on the networks that we do mev on. I think in Ethereum and stuff like that, the colocation is the last mile. You're still better off optimizing other parts of your algorithm before you go to that last leg. I think you can gain more efficiencies by, like, fine tuning go Ethereum and things like that, versus co locating.
00:12:32.424 - 00:13:08.630, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I think, like, for sex decks are probably. Colocation is more important, but then, yeah, some of these, like, more long tail strategies is probably, like you were saying, like, optimizing. Optimizing around the code. So how different. And you kind of started this by saying that you're seeing a lot of what started on Ethereum now moving to BSC. How different is mev on without exposing too much of your strategies, how different is mev on Ethereum versus BSc? Like, just, I don't know, competition and strategies and whatnot.
00:13:08.782 - 00:13:43.354, Speaker B: You know, about a year, probably the last time when we started, it was like, it was a lot easier on BSc versus on Ethereum, but I think BSc has matured significantly and is turning similar to or has gone on a similar trajectory, like, the Ethereum ecosystem. So, you know, you have relays, you have private mempools, all that kind of stuff. So I think, like, the ecosystems are almost parallel.
00:13:43.474 - 00:13:55.106, Speaker A: Do you think that a lot of the builders and searchers that are. I guess, yeah, working on Ethereum are also working on BSC? Or, like, are these your competition now or. Not really.
00:13:55.250 - 00:13:59.602, Speaker B: I don't think they are. I don't think they are. People stick to their networks.
00:13:59.738 - 00:14:10.516, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to ask you about l two s more in a second. But, like, what, do you see any other EVM chains? Like, or is. Is BSc primarily where you're focused and then, is that pretty much it?
00:14:10.620 - 00:14:41.114, Speaker B: No, we. I mean, like, our, our calculation has always been. It's like, the cost of experimentation plus the, the return, that that's kind of how we figure out what chain to go on, which was, like, in the. In the bull market. It just made BSc super, um, super accessible. You know, we're looking at a whole bunch of other EVM related chains. We're looking at non EVM chains.
00:14:41.114 - 00:14:49.298, Speaker B: We're, like, looking at doing Mev on, on osmosis, we're looking at doing cross chain mev.
00:14:49.466 - 00:15:15.788, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, how big of a, how big of a jump would it be for you guys? Like, I don't know. I say, you say you're looking. I mean, it sounds like, and I've heard you this before, like, a lot of what you do is sort of data research and, like, figuring out whether or not there's a market for what you guys can do. How big of a jump is it for a firm like yours to say, okay, we're going to start doing maybe on Solana, for example. Would that be a huge investment and overhead prior to getting in?
00:15:15.876 - 00:15:36.534, Speaker B: Solana, I think, is a huge one because of the differences it has with most other blockchains. But, for example, um, from Ethereum or from Uniswap, uh, backgrounds to osmosis backgrounds is. It's not that much of a step.
00:15:36.614 - 00:15:38.430, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.
00:15:38.582 - 00:15:42.686, Speaker B: The, the Solano ecosystem. Ecosystem is, would be a huge.
00:15:42.790 - 00:15:53.198, Speaker A: On that note, like, what do you think of, okay, so I had anatolian, uh, earlier this year, and he said the faster a chain goes, the less mev there is. True or false?
00:15:53.366 - 00:16:25.690, Speaker B: It's probably true. Like, you know, that's when colocation becomes important. That's like, that's when you start to run into the high frequency trading problem, which is who has the closest network cable to the server that's hosting the orders. And, yeah, then you start to, uh, you know, try and co locate and hyper optimize everything so that you can be in those nanoseconds.
00:16:25.802 - 00:16:46.180, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. And, like, I think that, in, in a sense, I think that Solana has sort of accepted this and has said, like, this is that this is the path we're going, and it's going to be, it's going to be super fast. And, like, people may need to co locate around these, you know, validators or builders or whatever. Like, I mean, that was sort of the essence of it. It's just interesting. Yeah. To hear that type of thing.
00:16:46.180 - 00:17:06.060, Speaker A: So how much MeV is being done with l two s? Like, you know, because obviously, l two s have these single sequencers, so it's not like this. It's not this, you know, consensus leader type election thing. Right. Like, and so, like, what, what does the MeV look like on l two s? And is this a big opportunity or. Not really, I.
00:17:06.132 - 00:17:46.906, Speaker B: We haven't looked that much into it yet, I have to say. I assume you, we do things pop up on our radar that look interesting. And I think it's going to be a huge space in the mid to long term, but yeah, right now, with everything being kind of single sequencer environment and stuff like that, it's probably more limited than it would be in a couple of months. I think the. I think cross chain Mev is going to be huge. I think that like, roll up bridge Mev and all of that stuff is going to be. It's going to be insane.
00:17:47.050 - 00:18:06.590, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. What. Do you have any thoughts, maybe not even from an mv perspective, but just. Do you have any thoughts on shared sequencing? Yeah, like it, it. Is this something? Because the thing is, like, right now on l two s, there's a single sequencer and there's not people getting like sandwiched to death, really. Right.
00:18:06.590 - 00:18:33.914, Speaker A: Because, like, these are these. They're, they're providing, like, is it. Is it first come, first serve? Basically for. For these l two sequencers. So, like, is opening up the door with something like a shared sequencer or a much more distributed, kind of like builder set? Like, is this something that should even be worth pursuing? Like, I joke a lot about how I think that all the sequencers should just stay centralized. Like, if you want to give me a really good execution. But, like, I know this isn't like the long term ideal, but like, what are your thoughts? Like, is this.
00:18:33.914 - 00:18:35.766, Speaker A: What do you think of shared sequencers?
00:18:35.790 - 00:18:46.754, Speaker B: First of all, maybe idealistically it makes sense, right. Because the single sequencer is kind of like the benevolent thing, right? Like you're not getting sandwiched just because.
00:18:47.254 - 00:18:49.430, Speaker A: The coinbase is running it.
00:18:49.542 - 00:19:29.320, Speaker B: Yeah. Right. But they could. And so I think for that purpose, the, like, it makes sense to do the whole shared sequencer stuff. It's such a weird give and a take, right? Like we always. There's so many, we've made all these things, like, so composable and broken it down that. Like, is it better, like, is something posting on eth that is controlled by one person better than a single database? I don't know.
00:19:29.432 - 00:20:00.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is a question a lot of people are asking, but there are a lot of. I mean, there's a lot of smart people working on this. So, you know, I think the vision is like, you know, like what you were saying idealistically, like, we have some system whereby there's similar, you know, at least goals, aspirations of decentralization within these l two s. But it does seem like. Yeah, right now. And I mean, it is kind of a give or take also in the sense that like users are getting better execution for the most part. You know what I mean? Like they're not getting sandwiched.
00:20:00.860 - 00:20:14.644, Speaker A: I think this is, it'll be interesting to see, it's interesting to hear you say that cross will be huge. What do you think about intents? Like this has been a huge buzzword recently. Like is this just limit orders or is this just private order flow?
00:20:14.804 - 00:21:28.544, Speaker B: Intents are interesting because I had this conversation with the team yesterday. Intents are interesting because like everything, everything's always been designed as intense. The problem is it intents, once again, like explodes the entire design space, right? Because for every intent you now have a different solver architecture. And then you'd have to figure out, or the people who like, are able to compete are the ones who figure out how to link solver architectures or link solvers with other, other solvers that are unrelated and things like that. Right. So it just like, it blows up the entire like design space again, which means there's just like more and more we're bringing. It's like this paradox of like creating more of these decentralized points where you then need to have an MEV shop that kind of has the holistic overview in order to bring market efficiency.
00:21:28.544 - 00:22:08.106, Speaker B: The most efficient solver is one that's going to be solving over multiple protocols. And you can only do that like as a shop that has an understanding of multiple protocols. Yeah, I viewed that. I think that most MeV shops will do the same thing, which is they're going to do Mev, they're going to do market making and they're going to do other like liquidity provision type things that fall into that circle. As long as it brings efficiency within a market. Cause you need to have kind of the whole overview. Yeah.
00:22:08.106 - 00:22:17.490, Speaker B: And like if you're solving for cow swap, you're going to solve for Uniswap and you're going to try and use your liquidity on both exchanges and things.
00:22:17.602 - 00:23:00.696, Speaker A: What do you think? And once again, that's another thing I heard you talk about like this idea that you, some shops, and I think you put yourself in this category may be willing to operate at a theoretical loss for a while in order to crowd somebody out of a strategy. Right. Like you, you're just, I mean the idea is like you're richer than somebody and you can just carry on a strategy for long enough that they're not going to make money and then you can capture the market. Is this what you like? Are we increasingly going this direction still, would you say? And also in terms of. Maybe you can just answer that. And then also with these long tail opportunities, are there still small searchers that are sending bundles and landing them? What are your thoughts?
00:23:00.800 - 00:23:08.912, Speaker B: You're definitely still seeing small searchers that are landing bundles? Well, I say small searcher, but what the fuck is a small searcher?
00:23:09.008 - 00:23:09.832, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
00:23:09.928 - 00:23:19.856, Speaker B: Who knows? Right? Like, you're definitely, you're seeing bots that are running single strategies that are very specific. So very long tail.
00:23:20.000 - 00:23:20.804, Speaker A: Okay.
00:23:21.424 - 00:23:37.314, Speaker B: I think in a lot of the environments, the game right now is outbidding everyone. And so, yeah, a lot of people are losing money on their strategies, I think, to price out competition.

And also, do amms still have a lot of work to do in terms of improving execution and whatnot for users?
00:24:03.850 - 00:24:52.498, Speaker B: Amms are really good at what they do, and there's very simple design solutions to mitigate a lot of MEV in Amms. If you turn an Amm into a linear function, all inputs are in and then all outputs come out and you settle one price in a block. Like, if your amm is a chain, then you don't have sandwiching, right. I think the problem with all of this stuff then becomes then we're trying to rationalize about what the definition of MeV is, right. Which inevitably, in the end is just some form of arbitrage.
00:24:52.586 - 00:25:00.234, Speaker A: And I heard you kind of saying that before as well. You're saying like, I don't know, that you would consider all stat Arb, for example, to be mev, right?
00:25:00.274 - 00:25:13.648, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I don't even think that, like, the things we do at Blanc anymore are Mev. It's just like, you know, stat Arb with inputs from different sources which happen to be on chain.
00:25:13.786 - 00:25:52.984, Speaker A: Is sandwiching bad still? It's, I mean, is this like, has this, would you say? I think, because I think a lot of people, when they hear sandwiching, this is like the worst form to them. Like, this is something that's like very, very bad. And at least insofar as for users, you know, I think people find this to be like one of the most extractive. And then obviously Jared from subway kind of exacerbated the hype around sandwiching is. Yeah. Like, our sandwich is still, like, you know, you see, like, if you, if you look at the actual amounts that are being sandwiched, like, the overwhelming majority of time, it's pretty trivial, right? Like, it's like maybe $1.50 or $2 if you go and track.
00:25:52.984 - 00:26:11.472, Speaker A: It's quite interesting. Like, you hear these stories, people getting sandwiched for like $50,000. Like, those are massive outliers. Right. But like, is this still a big problem? Or are users like you starting to get better execution either from app interfaces or through wallets or whatever it may be? Rpcs?
00:26:11.568 - 00:26:15.064, Speaker B: I think sandwiching is inherently a UX issue.
00:26:15.184 - 00:26:16.504, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:26:16.624 - 00:26:35.112, Speaker B: Like most, most Mev boils down to a UX issue, other than the, like, stuff that you just can't get out of the protocol, out of protocols. Right. Like, some me just has to happen. Like, it has to exist. Like someone needs to rebalance pools some liquidations.
00:26:35.288 - 00:26:36.016, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:36.160 - 00:26:57.624, Speaker B: Right. But like, sandwiches and things like that, that's just a UX issue. And I think most interfaces and things like that, it's been abstracted away enough from users where you're not trading on either delta or uniswap v one with 100% slippage anymore.
00:26:57.924 - 00:27:27.652, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think about, because this is something that I've thought about personally, and, I mean, I don't know that I have strong feelings one way or another, but what do you think about the sort of necessity to send transactions to a private, you know, through a private relay or something? Like, is this, I mean, is this good? I mean, it's good for users, right? Like they're getting better execution, but in terms of like, sort of the, uh, the centralizing vectors along the supply chain now when, when users are using, you.
00:27:27.668 - 00:27:32.844, Speaker B: Know, blockchains, like, it adds, it adds trusted parties again.
00:27:32.964 - 00:27:34.184, Speaker A: Right, exactly.
00:27:34.534 - 00:28:05.092, Speaker B: Because now you, like transactions, are the most valuable form of data because it's data that has value attached to it. And so sending your transaction to a private relay, you inherently have to react trust, because there's a lot more that can be done with that information than with just a signed message example. Because there's, there's some inherent value attached to it.
00:28:05.188 - 00:28:37.254, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that that's like, um, I know Yuri Uri Klarman was made, like, uh. Or. Yeah, yes, like one of the, uh, maybe it was thogard, I forget. One of, one of these MV guys made this tweet about like, how many sort of like centralized parties were sending transactions through now. And I'm just wondering, like, for you, ideologically is this, like, is this a big, like. I mean, does this really go against our ideals? And also, is there even a way to prevent, like, having to send effectively private, you know, your transactions through private order flow?
00:28:37.414 - 00:29:10.960, Speaker B: I don't know what the research space looks like at this point. I don't have enough time to, like, look at everything that happens, but I would, I hope that people are looking at more oblivious transfer protocols and things like that to bring on transaction privacy. Yeah. Like, in an ideal world, I could send my transaction to any node and the node doesn't know what's happening up until inclusion. Right. That would be the ideal.
00:29:11.072 - 00:29:33.376, Speaker A: Is there a way to promote geographic distribution or. Yeah, decentralization, rather. Like, I know that. I think somebody wrote this, or maybe it was even Phil. Diane wrote this article about how you should be a geographic distribution or decentralization, Maxi. Like, is this something that can be promoted or with these types of systems? Not really.
00:29:33.560 - 00:29:44.296, Speaker B: I don't know if it can be. Right. Like, Ethereum tried to motivate people to run their own validators by making it 32. And you can't delegate and stuff like that.
00:29:44.360 - 00:29:45.474, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:29:47.294 - 00:29:53.638, Speaker B: I think inherently systems usually tend to recentralize.
00:29:53.806 - 00:29:54.594, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:55.134 - 00:30:23.358, Speaker B: And so I don't, I don't know if you can, you can fully, fully mitigate that. Like, Ethereum solution wasn't the 32 thing. You can delegate, but we got Lido. Right, right. Is Lido centralized? No, probably not. Like, there's how many providers underneath Lido, but, yeah, that's just the way it's going to happen. Right?
00:30:23.526 - 00:31:08.766, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I think, yeah, I mean, Lido, obviously it's a dao. And like you said, it's sort of an umbrella of validators, so. And obviously the counterclaim is, like, if it wasn't Lido, it would have been coinbase and binance, which, given how these systems work, like, even if it's sort of the lesser of two evils, it does, yeah. I mean, there's probably a good bit of legitimacy to that claim. So, yeah. I want to ask you, like, what, what do you view as, like, the differences between tradfi colocation and tradfi optimizing their code and then versus meV? Like, like, because I hear this, like, certain people say MeV is like, very similar to tradvy.
00:31:08.766 - 00:31:13.542, Speaker A: Like, would you agree with, like, high frequency trading trap? Would you agree with this? Or what are your thoughts?
00:31:13.678 - 00:31:25.030, Speaker B: So we tried to hire some people out of treadfy, and they were overwhelmed with the amount that we had to do, because in tradfi, you just buy the shorter cable.
00:31:25.182 - 00:31:26.222, Speaker A: Well, right.
00:31:26.358 - 00:31:50.704, Speaker B: You don't just buy the shorter cable. You obviously there's some engineering stuff as well. Right. But like the. The. I think the amount of like domain specific knowledge that's needed for or MEV is a lot more broad. Especially all of these weird protocols that you can link up together and interoperate in order to extract some form of value.
00:31:50.704 - 00:32:05.966, Speaker B: The real stars are the ones who are able to have this huge knowledge base and link all of that stuff together. More so than. Than just the geolocation Alpha.
00:32:06.070 - 00:32:27.442, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. There's been discussion recently about these timing games, like basically simulating latency. Is this something that you think is, I don't know, solvable or. What are your thoughts on these, specifically this timing game thing that's come up as of late?
00:32:27.598 - 00:32:31.794, Speaker B: I haven't seen anything around that, like delaying transactions or.
00:32:31.954 - 00:33:05.798, Speaker A: Yeah, like I think the essence of it, and now I'm having to explain, but so probably not like the best person to do so. But it's like you, like when you send your block to the relay, like there's like these 200 milliseconds that they simulate it, I guess. And so they're like. I guess builders are like actively pushing that back and back so that they can get the final. Yeah, like be the final bids to be simulated. But I think this is something that's occurring on Ethereum and it's becoming a bigger problem. And I actually just read recently today that Coinbase is now maybe playing these timing games.
00:33:05.798 - 00:33:17.630, Speaker A: So it looks like it's something that you may have to do to be competitive, but it doesn't sound like hopefully you have to do that on BSC yet. Somebody, side note, somebody called you the SCP of BSC. Would you agree with that?
00:33:17.782 - 00:33:19.550, Speaker B: Maybe. I don't know.
00:33:19.742 - 00:33:21.554, Speaker A: I think it's kind of a compliment.
00:33:22.454 - 00:33:37.766, Speaker B: I take it as a compliment. I. CP guys are incredibly smart. I know Lev and co very where I know them personally, and they're incredibly smart. So I'll take that as a compliment.
00:33:37.790 - 00:33:54.862, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of interesting. Like, you don't hear these names very often. Right? Like Mev generally stays under the radar. I would say these shops try to stay on the radar, which makes total sense. Right. Would you say that there's been like, I don't know, somewhat of an. I don't know how I want to phrase this.
00:33:54.862 - 00:34:07.166, Speaker A: I don't want to make it sound like too cynical, but has there been like almost sort of a. It's been like taboo almost to talk about who's building blocks and, like, who these people are? Or is it just not something everyone.
00:34:07.230 - 00:34:08.486, Speaker B: Kind of knows who.
00:34:08.550 - 00:34:09.486, Speaker A: Right, exactly.
00:34:09.630 - 00:34:43.563, Speaker B: Like, you know, we know who SCP's blockbuilder is. We know who Windermere's blockbuilder is and stuff like that. I find it weird that we've had this discussion in the team, and we generally are relatively anonymous on who's on the team and things like that, but with our validators or with the block builders that we were planning on launching and the relays that we're planning on launching and things like that, we're going to be wholly transparent and just be like, hey, this is our thing.
00:34:44.763 - 00:35:11.590, Speaker A: Yeah, I think maybe, and I'm hypothesizing here, but these are real firms that people know. Right? Like you said, it's like, sort of, everybody kind of knows. I think maybe, like, the decentralization aspect. Like, ideally, we don't know that one firm of 20 guys is building 40% of the blocks on Ethereum. Like, that's like. Like, functionally, this is how I see it. And I totally understand why.
00:35:11.590 - 00:35:22.878, Speaker A: Why they want to stay under the radar, right. For, like, multiple reasons. But it is. I do. It does seem like there's somewhat of a reluctance to, like, talk about this. And, I mean, what's.
00:35:22.926 - 00:35:37.006, Speaker B: I mean, what's even weird about them? Like, sure, they want to stay under the radar, but what's even weird about them is, like, they don't link their technologies, right? Like, they. They have a different name for their block builder. They have a different name for their relay. They have a different name for whatever.
00:35:37.070 - 00:35:37.246, Speaker A: So.
00:35:37.270 - 00:35:39.430, Speaker B: So, like, they're. They want to hide everything.
00:35:39.582 - 00:35:45.686, Speaker A: Do you think this has anything to do with the legal aspects? I mean, I would just assume maybe some.
00:35:45.870 - 00:36:06.986, Speaker B: It's all such a gray zone, jurisdictionally speaking, and it depends on where you're in. And, like, some places it's fine. In some places it's not fine where it's, like, really hard. I don't think I. I honestly think it's more of the trying to avoid the Twitter mob than anything else.
00:36:07.010 - 00:36:08.814, Speaker A: Yes. Yes, exactly.
00:36:10.074 - 00:36:30.800, Speaker B: I don't think. I don't think legality actually ploys much into it because, like, you know, if an auditor or if anyone wants to look under the hood, you naming your builder different than you're relaying it doesn't really help.
00:36:30.952 - 00:36:50.296, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, they're going to figure it out. Do you think. Do you think sandwiching is legal? And the reason I'm asking this, or maybe, like, could there be an interpretation of sandwiching that may be illegal, because I. There's a guy, Alex Nuzloben. You probably know him, very sharp, and he understands traditional markets quite well.
00:36:50.296 - 00:37:21.478, Speaker A: Like, this is somebody who I defer to when somebody's talking about colocation and trap five versus in, you know, Defi or something. And, like, he's somebody who, like, genuinely understands traffic markets. And he has sort of tossed out the idea every so often that there's some potential strategies. And for what it's worth, this isn't my opinion as to whether or not it should be legal. I personally think that, like, you should be able to do whatever. Okay. But, like, he has tossed out some ideas that maybe, like, some of these things could be considered, I don't know, insider trading or, like, right on the cusp.
00:37:21.646 - 00:37:40.622, Speaker B: So my. My opinion is the following. If you're using public domain. So, like, if you're using a public mempool and blah, blah, blah, blah, I don't. I don't think it should be illegal. You're operating with the same worldview that everyone else has. That's how I would view it.
00:37:40.622 - 00:37:51.454, Speaker B: Like, I think it becomes. It becomes finicky when you start buying private order flow and things like that. You should probably, like, that's questionable.
00:37:51.614 - 00:38:15.856, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. Like, and this is something that I have. You know, you see a lot of people talking about, like, the transparency and openness and. Of these systems, and, like, this is good, of course, but there are reasons, like, for example, that citadel doesn't front run in the way that, like, mev. People may. And, like, when they buy order flow, it's not exactly for the same reasons.
00:38:15.856 - 00:38:24.906, Speaker A: And I think that people kind of conflate these sometimes, and it's like, this isn't exactly what's happening. Right. Like, it's more like, yeah, so I don't know if you, like, if you had thoughts on that.
00:38:24.930 - 00:38:43.774, Speaker B: Like, you know, different entities have different risk appetites. Right. Like, Citadel might be more exposed to us jurisdictions than some other entity might be who's doing something else, you know? Yeah. It all depends on. On entity risk appetite. Yes.
00:38:44.154 - 00:38:59.076, Speaker A: Yeah. And I would kind of, like, intuitively, I would agree with you regarding, you know, a public system. A public mempool is like, it's not really material, non public information. Like, you're. It's. Somebody broadcast a transaction out there, I guess, maybe. Yeah.
00:38:59.076 - 00:39:19.644, Speaker A: Like, so I've just. It has been really interesting to follow some of this, and I want. I do wonder, like, do you have any predictions as to, like, where this goes? Like, are there people talking about how regulators probably aren't like, so familiar with how maybe works, but they're starting to dig in? Like, do you have any predictions? I mean, hopefully you're safe in Switzerland, I would assume, but I don't know.
00:39:20.624 - 00:39:49.146, Speaker B: Yeah, so I do believe that when we, when we spoke with the swiss regulators or the opinion that we heard from the swiss regulators was as long as you're doing things with public things that are like, you know, public mempool, it's, it's fair game. Yeah, but the rules are going to change 3000 times until they're written. Right.
00:39:49.290 - 00:40:14.286, Speaker A: Do you think that, like, we've sort of talked about this a little bit, but like, do you think that these centralized builders, like, do you think that this is a big pressure point? Like, do you think this is a real vector of regulation? Like, what we were talking about? Like, it's not, it's not going to be difficult for Beaver Bill to be traced to SCP, you know, like, it's not. Do you think this is like a big vector of like, oh, okay, well, they can just pressure them and we see them already censoring ofac transactions. Right.
00:40:14.390 - 00:40:31.614, Speaker B: Yeah, that's definitely gonna happen. Right. Because, yeah, there you have, there you have directors and shareholders and whatnot to go to. And so it would be nice to have more non legal entities doing, doing this stuff in the space.
00:40:31.774 - 00:40:54.792, Speaker A: Yeah, we're seeing that sort of play out a little bit already, but it's hard to know, like, you know, what you were saying that you would prefer builders not censor at all. Um. Like what, what do you see? Like, is it. Yeah, is this like, concerning that, that beaver and our sync are not including effect transactions or is this like, not a huge deal to you?
00:40:54.968 - 00:41:03.652, Speaker B: I'm like, I think it's problematic. Yeah, I, yeah, like, mainly because I'm swiss.
00:41:03.828 - 00:41:05.704, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:41:06.324 - 00:41:41.312, Speaker B: I think it's problematic. But I understand why they have to, if they're registered in specific countries. Like, if our cities are registered in specific countries, we have to do it as well. Right. We don't build and so we haven't had to, we haven't had that run in yet. But, yeah, in an ideal world, we wouldn't be censoring the protocol. Well, in a fully ideal world, we wouldn't be able to censor the transactions because we don't know what's in them.
00:41:41.312 - 00:41:41.856, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:41.960 - 00:41:58.314, Speaker A: Have you actually, that brings up an interesting point. Do you think such a future is possible with encrypted mempools? I mean, there's always kind of this, like, the argument is always kind of like, well, somebody has to decrypt that at some point, right. And they have an edge.
00:41:58.614 - 00:42:29.694, Speaker B: Right. Somebody still make a block. And at that point, like the only thing you're doing is you're, you're pricing out those who can do Mev. And so honestly, I think not doing that is better, in a weird contradiction, because like, I would rather not have a highly well endowed entity be the only one that's able to do me.
00:42:29.854 - 00:42:49.502, Speaker A: Right, right, exactly. And this is like sort of the catch 22, I think, of a lot of these solutions is that you can reduce Mev. Like functionally, you absolutely can reduce Mev maybe down to a negligible level, but by doing that, you're almost always centralizing.
00:42:49.598 - 00:42:51.078, Speaker B: Make it more expensive. You always.
00:42:51.126 - 00:42:52.830, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:42:52.862 - 00:42:55.302, Speaker B: That's, that's kind of how I, how I view it.
00:42:55.398 - 00:42:56.078, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:56.246 - 00:43:03.022, Speaker B: Which is why I think that a lot of these MeV prop shops become vertically integrated, like clearing houses.
00:43:03.118 - 00:43:04.078, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:43:04.206 - 00:43:11.510, Speaker B: Because they just need to be on all of the edges of the network in order to operate.
00:43:11.582 - 00:43:39.924, Speaker A: What are your overarching thoughts on crypto? Like, how are we doing? Is crypto exciting to you? Like, I know, um, there, there's a lot of mechanism designers who do not care about crypto. Like they just are, they've been nerd sniped and they just want to do cool tricks and get paid to do it. You know what I mean? Like you seem, like, you seem, from what I can infer, you seem pretty ideologically driven, I would say. But I don't know where you fall in regards to crypto, I mean, or like what specifically?
00:43:40.304 - 00:43:47.038, Speaker B: I'd say I'm pretty ideologically driven mainly because. Been trying to set up a bank account for the past week.
00:43:47.166 - 00:43:48.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw this.
00:43:50.534 - 00:44:38.922, Speaker B: You know what, I spoke about this with my co founder recently and I think we're in a good spot. But I really appreciate Vitalik's post that he wrote about bringing the cypherpunk back into crypto because we kind of lost our way. I don't think that all of this consumer stuff matters. I don't think a lot of, you know, I don't care for nfTs, I don't care for a lot of these consumer use cases because I think that the financial use case is already a trillion dollar industry. Right. Just being able to freely move money is a valuable enough use case where we may not need any other use case. Right.
00:44:38.922 - 00:45:11.932, Speaker B: Like I don't think maybe we don't, we probably don't need crypto social as long as, like, you know, like that. That's my real thought on it. And so I'm sad there's not more experimentation in the defi space. I feel like it's kind of, like, become very quiet, and everyone's focusing on this, like, New York crypto consumer stuff, and that's less interesting to me. I think that the. We should. We should get back to bringing the currency into cryptocurrency.
00:45:12.068 - 00:45:20.276, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm 100% with you. Like, I couldn't agree more. And I. When you say you'd like to see more stern transition in DeFi, what do you think is missing right now?
00:45:20.420 - 00:45:22.940, Speaker B: Everything is over collateralized money markets. Right?
00:45:23.012 - 00:45:23.624, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:24.444 - 00:45:58.638, Speaker B: And so anything that allows me to bring more efficiency to my capital is something that is necessary in the space, I think, like, chilling my own bags here. But gearbox is a team that's been able to execute that quite well by building margin accounts on chain. But we need more experimentation like that. I think it needs to be. We need to venture out into more interesting defi use cases like that, rather than just over collateralized markets.
00:45:58.806 - 00:46:00.942, Speaker A: What do you think about restaking? Do you have any thoughts?
00:46:01.038 - 00:46:42.680, Speaker B: I think it's going to be a huge house of cards that will probably. I foresee that one of these restaking protocols will definitely cause some huge blow up. I don't know if it will cause a main chain to blow up or only one of the x down the road, but I think it's a huge systemic risk issue that I think will. But it's inevitable, right. You give people the tools to build those products, and they're going to build those products because it's the financialization of everything.
00:46:42.832 - 00:46:52.734, Speaker A: Do you view the current Ethereum roadmap with roll ups favorably? I mean, what do you think so far?
00:46:53.914 - 00:47:39.904, Speaker B: I honestly, since my. When I was a bit more in touch with e two research and stuff, I haven't kept that up to date. To me, the ecosystem looks like it's kind of funny. Cosmos kind of had this idea in 2014 or whatever, whenever they started already, and it seems like the world is kind of moving to a Cosmos centric design space, and I'm actually kind of bullish, Adam, if they can figure their shit out and be the gold standard for that. So I think things are moving towards the app chain, cosmos style ecosystem.
00:47:40.024 - 00:47:55.780, Speaker A: Let me just ask, maybe more specifically, are you bullish anyway? Maybe not l two. Well, yeah. Are you bullish? Any l two specifically? Or, like, do you look at any of the l two s and think, like, these guys are on the right track versus these guys, or is it all sort of similar to you right now?
00:47:55.932 - 00:48:01.892, Speaker B: My main issue with l two s right now is that they all. Or that a majority of them are evm for.
00:48:02.068 - 00:48:05.964, Speaker A: Right, exactly. Yeah. We haven't seen much experimentation there. I think a lot of people mentioned.
00:48:06.044 - 00:48:36.578, Speaker B: Yeah, I tweeted about this a couple of days ago. Is that, like, you'd think that, you know, now that we have. You know, we have near instant bridging with things like XLR and squid router and wormhole and whatnot. Like, you think that that application specific chains would. Would become more, like, prevalent, but we haven't seen it yet. I fail to see a world in which we need 10,000 evms.
00:48:36.746 - 00:48:37.454, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:38.474 - 00:48:39.186, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:39.330 - 00:48:42.874, Speaker A: I think we're gonna get uni chain. Like, I feel. I feel pretty confident about this.
00:48:42.954 - 00:48:46.334, Speaker B: It would make sense. I think a Dex as a chain makes sense.
00:48:46.754 - 00:49:21.422, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I think that. And, you know, it's interesting because you hear Hayden kind of talk about this and talk about how he feels, maybe stifled, to some extent, by the direction that ethereum's gone, and, like, it makes all the sense in the world for them to have their own chain. Yeah. Do you think that Ethereum should be attempting to innovate more on the l one, or do you, like, where do you fall in that camp? Like, sort of the settlement layer? Ultrasound money, maybe trying to make improvements.
00:49:21.558 - 00:49:57.498, Speaker B: I think Ethereum should move faster. Yeah, I think it's been pretty slow for a pretty long time, which has led a lot of other chains to catch up. And I think we may see a cycle where ETH is no longer the dominant application specific chain, but that happens with technology. It's the inherent ossification of a system. People are scared to change it because there's a lot of money that's relying on it.
00:49:57.596 - 00:50:04.470, Speaker A: Do you look at Solana and think that, like, what are your thoughts on Solana? I kind of touched on that, but not really.
00:50:04.622 - 00:50:24.038, Speaker B: So I. I've honest, I don't even have a Solana wallet. I've honestly never interacted with Solana. It's a completely different, like, sphere of people than I interact with, which probably is a good thing. Right? Maybe I'm honestly. I may be like a crypto boomer. Like, I may be.
00:50:24.038 - 00:50:56.748, Speaker B: I may be now what I viewed bitcoiners as two years ago. Right. But I'm just on the eth end. Yeah. I think that the winner will be somewhere in between an ETH and a Solana. Or maybe the merging of the two through bringing Solana style chains to settle on Ethereum using a celestia, using something like that.
00:50:56.876 - 00:51:05.428, Speaker A: Uh, tell me what is going on. Like, not from the mv side, but just what is going on on BSC? Like, is it djen? Like, what? What? Because that's always sort of the.
00:51:05.556 - 00:51:07.716, Speaker B: I think it's. It's mainly djen.
00:51:07.860 - 00:51:16.076, Speaker A: Yeah. And is there anything, like, a value there that it interests you, or is it just, like, just same. Same old BSC?
00:51:16.260 - 00:51:32.154, Speaker B: They're launching an l two, but same old bsc. I think people underestimate BSc because it has a huge consumer usage rate, but, yeah, yeah, it's just bsc.
00:51:32.574 - 00:51:38.046, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, that sort of, like, what? I mean, it's. I think it's very popular in Asia. Is that right?
00:51:38.190 - 00:51:39.390, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:51:39.422 - 00:51:52.604, Speaker A: And, like, this. That's just an area that, like, a lot of people on crypto, Twitter, for example, just have no idea about. You know, like, in. Not dissimilar to Tron. Although maybe some of Tron's numbers are a little bit fudged. But. But it does, like, you know, like, so much USD.
00:51:52.604 - 00:51:59.668, Speaker A: USDT settles on Tron. People are just, like, completely unaware of this. So it's similar. Uh, is actually. That's. I wanted to ask you what that is. Tron.
00:51:59.668 - 00:52:02.024, Speaker A: Like, you guys ever, uh. Do you do anything on Tron?
00:52:02.724 - 00:52:11.584, Speaker B: Um, we were. We were kind of looking at Tron. Um, the amount of trades that happen for the strategies that we do, it just didn't make sense.
00:52:11.964 - 00:52:15.934, Speaker A: Well, I don't know if we. I feel like we covered a lot. Uh, what do you think?
00:52:16.094 - 00:52:16.694, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:16.814 - 00:52:23.678, Speaker A: You got anything else interesting little tidbits that you want to share? Something spicy? I feel like I asked you a lot of the spicy questions I wanted, so that's good.
00:52:23.806 - 00:52:31.238, Speaker B: I don't. I don't think I have anything. I'm not that spicy these days. I'm. I've. I said I think I've become a. Become a chain boomer.
00:52:31.366 - 00:52:39.262, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, actually, I actually did want to ask you one thing, because I'm kind of a bit of a bitcoiner myself. What? Do you, uh. Do you like bitcoin? Do you care about bitcoin at all?
00:52:39.398 - 00:52:42.816, Speaker B: I have not held a single bitcoin since 2016.
00:52:42.910 - 00:52:46.304, Speaker A: Okay. So that answers that pretty. Pretty easily.
00:52:48.124 - 00:52:57.740, Speaker B: I think. Bitcoin. Bitcoin is interesting for what it did, but it failed at the one promise that it wanted to serve, which is to be digital cash.
00:52:57.932 - 00:52:58.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:58.844 - 00:53:20.704, Speaker B: And it ossified so fast where people didn't let it become something. And now you have these teams that are wasting resources and time building on bitcoin, like the Lightning network team team. Smart engineers. But why are they still working on that? You know, they've been working on it for how many years and how many users do they have?
00:53:20.784 - 00:54:02.964, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of bitcoiners would agree with you on that, and I think a lot of bitcoin is realizing that lightning is not the end game, so. Well, maybe next time we talk, you'll be interested in some bitcoin l two s, if those are actually real yet. Um, yeah, it's kind of a thing. I mean, they're multi sigs, but, you know, I'm a little bit. Yeah, I'm not too quick to pass judgment. I mean, most ethereum l two s are multi sig, so I'm not going to, like, cast aspersions yet, but. Yeah, no, I mean, I think a lot of people agree with you that, you know, lightning has been, at worst, a dead end and at best, something that is certainly not going to support digital cash for the entire world.
00:54:02.964 - 00:54:10.870, Speaker A: So, um. Yeah, well, Dean, it was awesome talking. Thank you for coming on. I thought we hit a lot of very interesting points. I really appreciate it.
00:54:10.982 - 00:54:11.854, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me.
