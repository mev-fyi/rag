00:00:28.054 - 00:00:44.890, Speaker A: Hey, guys. I'm here today with Tarun. Tarun doesn't need much of an introduction, but I will allow him one. Most people should know Tarun from Twitter. And being a key opinion leader and.
00:00:44.962 - 00:00:48.842, Speaker B: Venture capitalist, I'm not a fucking real kol, hopefully.
00:00:49.018 - 00:00:52.214, Speaker A: All right, introduce yourself the way you would like Tarun.
00:00:53.354 - 00:01:09.578, Speaker B: No, I just think, like, people in the US and people in Asia view Kols as very different. In Asia, it's like this positive thing. It's like, well, sort of. You're sort of like a gang leader who, like, pumps shitcoins and dumps them on people. And then in the US, it's like.
00:01:09.626 - 00:01:10.666, Speaker A: It's the same thing.
00:01:10.810 - 00:01:39.484, Speaker B: It's the same thing. But it's like you're supposed to not do it. So I don't. As a non pumper, I hope I don't stay kol. Anyway, um, yeah, hey, Verun done a lot of stuff in crypto, mainly two things. Run gauntlet, and then also, uh, invest. And, uh, you know, all I have to say is, uh, crypto never disappoints in its drama, as Gort knows better than anyone else.
00:01:40.224 - 00:01:40.608, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:40.656 - 00:01:44.244, Speaker B: How's Robert doing? I love how he replied to you, by the way.
00:01:44.584 - 00:01:56.354, Speaker A: I know, I know. Um. But, yeah. Okay. We should give some context, because I don't know when this is going to air, but, uh, this was, like, the day after the uniswap got issued a wells notice by the sec.
00:01:58.254 - 00:01:58.590, Speaker B: So.
00:01:58.622 - 00:02:01.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know how. I don't know how Rick burns. What do you think about this case, though?
00:02:04.294 - 00:02:36.044, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. I think uniswap has a pretty good chance of winning. It seems like at least that's sort of my gut take. And I also just feel like it's election year, so it seems a little weird to spend so many resources when there's an election in, like, five months and, like, you could be out of office. Feels a little like a Hail Mary for. For the SEC, because, like, if they just get kicked out of office, you know, in like, 2 seconds, let's say Trump wins, there's, like, no way that this fucking case is even gonna keep going.
00:02:37.144 - 00:02:42.784, Speaker A: Have you actually looked in? Have you, like, read the details? I usually don't know, pine on any of the regulatory stuff.
00:02:42.824 - 00:02:58.096, Speaker B: No, no, no. I honestly just read, like, some summaries from lawyers, and then I asked different lawyers, I pulled, like, five lawyers, and I got three. Three out of five saying they think uniswap has a strong case. So that's my prediction market. That was. Yeah, it wasn't.
00:02:58.160 - 00:02:58.336, Speaker A: But.
00:02:58.360 - 00:03:12.524, Speaker B: But, you know, obviously it's proof of. Proof of lawyer, so, you know, I'm not sure if that's totally the most reliable thing, but I wanted to spend some time and actually read the case. But that shit is fucking long and.
00:03:13.464 - 00:03:15.044, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just so boring.
00:03:15.464 - 00:03:33.694, Speaker B: The AI summarization of legal docs is also real shit. Like, I feel like you ask it something and it, like, sometimes it'll just summarize the thing as saying, this is a really long document that says the same thing. But the thing is, there's always a needle in the haystack in these things. So it's like the AI is just missing the needle, unfortunately.
00:03:35.234 - 00:03:50.332, Speaker A: Okay, well, all right, that was a little bit of current event stuff. But the only reason I'm saying that is because, yeah, sometimes we air these weeks out, so I really. And also, you do a podcast every, what?
00:03:50.388 - 00:03:50.772, Speaker B: Thursday?
00:03:50.868 - 00:03:53.364, Speaker A: Friday, I think. Word.
00:03:53.404 - 00:03:56.556, Speaker B: Every Tuesday. And then it goes out every Thursday. Something like that.
00:03:56.620 - 00:04:08.268, Speaker A: Yeah. But, like, you. You typically keep up with, like, current event. I would say mainly shopping block is like the news of the week, if you will, from four vc's. Like, you really need to hear that.
00:04:08.436 - 00:04:20.360, Speaker B: It's the news of the week. I think the most embarrassing thing to me still is that everyone compares a fucking podcast to all in, and I'm like, I want to kill myself. If that's your best comparison, you can make that.
00:04:20.392 - 00:04:23.544, Speaker A: Well, it's a. Like, structurally, it's a good. It's a good comparison.
00:04:23.624 - 00:04:30.096, Speaker B: It's like four BC Bros. No, no, it's definitely. It's definitely a good comparison. It's just an embarrassing comparison for me.
00:04:30.120 - 00:04:35.112, Speaker A: Well, I don't listen. I don't listen to all in very often, but I do listen to choppy bike. Good bit. So that should make you feel better.
00:04:35.248 - 00:04:36.432, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you, sir.
00:04:36.488 - 00:04:45.254, Speaker A: All right. Okay. Um. What? Okay. What are you excited about right now? Like, what. What are you working on and what are you excited about in crypto?
00:04:47.234 - 00:05:19.078, Speaker B: What I'm working on a lot research wise right now, is basically trying to formalize some of the risk related things in Eigen layer AVss. So eigenlayer, actively validated services. This is like stuff where people can reuse. Well, reuse has many meanings, but. And reuse is the colloquial way of saying it. Security from one network to help bootstrap another network. These things are sort of like weird.
00:05:19.078 - 00:06:27.308, Speaker B: In between defi protocols and proof of stake, and figuring out how to model them and make them understand when they're safe or when they blow up or when worst case events happen is something that I think is a big unknown problem. The first Eigen layer AV's went live this week, and so now it's a question of like, how do you kind of think about the security of these things? So I've been doing that. I think the thing I feel like one thing I find funny from an investor standpoint, not as a person running a company, is sometimes in bull markets. You always find this thing. Thing where like, there's stuff that's real technology that people are working on, but the people who have real technology never get traction. And because, I don't know, they're all fighting with each other over who's the smartest. And then there's stuff that's like geo Bowdoin that gets crazy traction just because it's making fun of a hapless president.
00:06:27.308 - 00:07:46.430, Speaker B: So it's kind of like this funny thing where I find it hard to be excited about the things that I really like. And also, I'm not excited by the things that the market is doing. That being said, I think the war in zero knowledge proof land has been interesting. I think obviously there have been a bunch of new vms that have come out virtual machines for doing stuff with zero knowledge proofs. So that Joblo average developer can write some code without actually having to know any of the math, and it generates proofs. Now, as many of the anons on Twitter might tell you, well, it's great that you can do this now, but is there any real usage, any real application anyone can point to other than a roll up, which is a boring application? I've been thinking a lot about things that can use all this excess capacity of ZK, both proving capacity as well as just the fact that it's a lot easier to use that aren't. Just build me another blockchain.
00:07:46.622 - 00:07:48.634, Speaker A: Okay, what are these applications?
00:07:50.334 - 00:08:56.014, Speaker B: One of them is, how do you if you were to really build sort of like a decentralized mev auction where it actually has some guarantees about it, you would sort of need this. But again, that's only like a tiny step away from blockchain. A few other things are like, in order to make some defi things competitive with centralized exchanges, you need to make some state private. And so the question is, what's the minimum amount of stuff you can make private to get the capital efficiency to be kind of similar to a centralized exchange? So, honestly, those are the two ones. And I feel bad having just dunked on taking a new technology just to make another blockchain by giving you applications that speculate on people making another blockchain. But that's what it is. It is what it is.
00:08:56.514 - 00:09:16.644, Speaker A: Okay, just level with me. What is it about ZK tech that has nerd sniped the smartest people? What is it specifically, if you could put some type of parameters around ZK tech that has just entranced, like, all these gigabrains?
00:09:17.544 - 00:10:08.024, Speaker B: So I'll say, like, from the theoretical side, maybe to give a little slight history of where it comes from, because I feel like people use it very willy nilly nowadays, and it means, like, much more than it. Like, people use ZK as an umbrella term for, like, many different things that aren't even, like what? Zero, don't even have zero knowledge in them. And the simple, you know, I think basically in the, I want to say, eighties, early nineties, there was this very famous theorem called the PCP theorem. And yes, it is actually named after the drug in some very funny, very roundabout way. But the PCP theorem stands for probably correct proof. And what it means is.
00:10:10.244 - 00:10:10.676, Speaker A: I can.
00:10:10.700 - 00:10:56.132, Speaker B: Basically give you a set of questions that you have to answer about some object or computation that you have done. And I can give you a very small number of questions that try to ask you about this ferrari you claim you own, or this computation of a language model you claim to have done. And I can, you know, let's say that computation takes a million hours. Well, I can ask you 10 seconds worth of questions and get very high probability of knowing that you either lied or didn't lie. And the idea with that is sort of like the following. Like, I ask you a yes or no question. There's like probability one half that you lied to me.
00:10:56.132 - 00:11:36.594, Speaker B: I ask you another yes or no question that I can sort of get validation on. Now, the probability that you're able to lie on both successfully is one fourth, I ask you another question. The probability is one eight. So the idea is I can kind of ask you the sequence of questions that for you to have lied to me the entire time, the probability is decaying very quickly. So that's what a probably correct proof is, because probably correct proof sounds like a contradiction. A proof is supposed to be something that holds always, right? But I added the word probably, and that's probably comes from the idea that, like, hey, it might have been possible for you to have lied to me for all these questions, but it's the probability you did all of that. It's decaying really fast.
00:11:36.594 - 00:12:42.054, Speaker B: Okay, so why does this have to do with PCP? The drug sencicledine, the NMDA agonist is the inventor of the PCP theorem. Safra, I forget whatever, at Berkeley, was arrested by the Berkeley police, I think on the day they figured this out for supposedly having PCP possession. And then they decided to come up with an acronym that had PCP in it to commemorate them getting wrongfully arrested, which I think is just a funny story because all these fucking Cs nerd people don't realize that PCP is a joke. That troll is like, a troll name for them. But anyway, so this PCP theorem, it sort of says, like, hey, I can validate something that may have taken you a lot of work in, much less work than it takes you to have done. And in fact, I can sort of. In.
00:12:42.054 - 00:13:42.774, Speaker B: Over time, people found ways where it's almost a constant amount of work to verify arbitrarily large computations. The interesting thing about this is all of the things I've said so far have nothing to do with ZK, as in zero knowledge. All of the things I have described are what is called succinctness, which is I take a really large thing and I compress it. I give you some random samples, and you can be sure that the large thing is true from a very small set of samples. The reason you like people like this is like, it basically is a way for me to kind of prove to you that I've done something that's hard, maybe something that you can't do, maybe something you don't have data for doing, but you can trust that I actually did it correctly. And I think that's sort of one of these things that's inevitably difficult to do. But a dumb version of this is imagine.
00:13:42.774 - 00:13:58.882, Speaker B: I don't know if you remember that there's this. One of the world's most expensive painting ever sold at auction is thought to be fake. The Salvador Mundi, which is, I guess, the saudi kingdom.
00:13:58.938 - 00:14:01.494, Speaker A: Oh, yes, yes, I've heard this story. Okay, go on.
00:14:02.654 - 00:14:47.986, Speaker B: And the question is, what if you could actually validate that something was real or fake from a very small set of its history properties? I think the thing about NFTs is, okay, yeah, I have to go validate that the entire chain of transactions is correct. The average dude on the street that I go up to, and I'm like, hey, here's this art from gort. Gort's this famous underground street artist that you've never heard of, but I promise you it's from him. How do I actually go validate that? I go on chain. I go to block Explorer, and I look up Gort ETH and see if you minted it. That's not really sufficient. I need to prove to you some properties that, like, hey, Vitalik bought a bunch of gort ETH stuff, and so it's priced one up.
00:14:47.986 - 00:15:31.158, Speaker B: So that's actually why you want to buy it. How do I prove those properties to you? In the normal world, it's actually quite hard to do that. What you end up doing is pay appraisers, or you have all these kind of, like, indirect third parties to do things, but with DK, you don't have to. So, yeah, that was a bit rambly. But the long story short is the succinctness properties of zero knowledge proofs are things people want. The zero knowledge part is just that, hey, I can actually give you the succinct proof, like, I did X with a very small number of samples in a way such that you can't figure out any information about my private data in X. But very few people are actually doing ZK.
00:15:31.158 - 00:15:46.734, Speaker B: Almost everyone who says ZK is doing only succinctness. Like, roll ups are fully transparent. ZK roll ups are fully transparent. So they're not actually doing any privacy preserving stuff. So they're not even doing the ZK part of ZK. They're doing just succinctness.
00:15:46.894 - 00:15:49.242, Speaker A: What about Aztec? Is that an example?
00:15:49.358 - 00:16:18.316, Speaker B: Aztec is actually doing ZK? Yeah, they actually are trying to be private. But most ZK roll ups are transparent. And there's reasons for that. Some regulatory, some technical. There's a bunch of different kind of factors involved. But, okay, I mean, for you, as someone who's asking this question of, like, why are all these people so interested in it?
00:16:18.450 - 00:16:19.240, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:16:19.312 - 00:16:28.296, Speaker B: What. What. What does it make you? Like, what are the things you kind of think about it? Like, I'm kind of curious, like, what your view of it is as, from the outside.
00:16:28.360 - 00:17:06.740, Speaker A: No, no, I mean, I was. I was actually, I talked to this bitcoiner guy last week, and we. We were, like, half joking about this. It's just, I I think it has this allure, like, the. The ZK aspect has this allure that the average person, like, okay, I'm not explaining this well, but I did explain it in this other broadcast. Like, for people who are giga brains to people who have no understanding of it, there's like, a massive, I think, disconnect. Whereas, like, if you're talking about something, like, the example I gave last time was, like, artificial super intelligence.
00:17:06.740 - 00:17:46.654, Speaker A: Like, if I can reason. Maybe not well, but I can reason, okay, about, like, okay, if we have artificial super intelligence, like, there's a lot of things that are going to be a lot better. There's, like, you know, like, the world will truly change. And when. Whereas, like, when I hear people talk about how disruptive ZK is to how I understand it, it's like, yeah, I mean, it. It doesn't resonate with, I think, non technical people, but it has captivated, like, a lot of clearly very intelligent people across. I mean, I obviously, like, know this from crypto, but, like, I mean, I think that, God, there was some.
00:17:46.654 - 00:17:57.686, Speaker A: Somebody pretty well known said that, like, the two breakthroughs of this generation are AI and Zk tech. And I'm like, okay, I know that maybe a.
00:17:57.790 - 00:17:59.494, Speaker B: Like, who else. Who else would have said that?
00:17:59.534 - 00:18:42.068, Speaker A: No, no, no, I read this tweet. I mean, it was some Silicon Valley thinkor. But I'm just saying, like, just, you know, you know, a thought leader. But I'm just saying, like, there's just a big. I think there's a big divide between, like, how incredible all you people think it is versus how I'm like, okay, I mean, what does it do? Like, I mean, it's like, you can prove to me that you could drink alcohol without giving me your age. Like, okay, is this the end game? Like, do we have anything else to go off of? You know what I mean? No, because it's, like, the example that people use a lot, and, like, okay, it kind of resonates, I guess. Like, maybe the compression aspect like that, you know, like, we can prove a lot of work has been done or something.
00:18:42.068 - 00:18:44.144, Speaker A: I don't know. It's just, it's interesting.
00:18:44.484 - 00:19:26.914, Speaker B: One difference between, like, the AI versus DK thing is, AI is, like, its value is very obvious from the output that it generates, but no one knows why the output is generated in ZK. It's kind of the opposite. It's like, it's very unclear what the value of the output is. It's so dependent on the thing you're proving and whether you care about, you know, having ability to verify that someone didn't fuck you. But you know why it works. So it's like, the fact that you know, why it works, I think, is if you, you know, kind of dig into it is probably why I think smart people like it versus. Okay, so, like, you know, AI, it's like, I don't know why the fuck it works.
00:19:26.914 - 00:19:28.026, Speaker B: Like. Like, it's.
00:19:28.050 - 00:19:28.202, Speaker A: It's.
00:19:28.218 - 00:20:11.634, Speaker B: It's actually, like, we're actually at this point where, like, people are just, like, empirically throwing darts on the board and they're just trying different architectures, burning a bunch of compute until they find something that looks like it works. We don't have any epistemological reason for why a transformer is a slightly better architecture than an RNN, which was its predecessor, but somehow it seems to encode some structure better. We know all these heuristics, but we don't know why it works. Whereas with GK, you have a lot more certainty. You really do know why it works. And I think that difference is probably why ZK has, like, the hardest marketing job in history. No one really gives, like, the average person does not give a shit why your technology works.
00:20:11.634 - 00:20:14.394, Speaker B: They kind of only care about the output. Right, right.
00:20:14.474 - 00:20:18.490, Speaker A: The token. The output is the token.
00:20:18.642 - 00:20:21.014, Speaker B: Well, both. For both of them, it's tokens.
00:20:21.634 - 00:20:46.954, Speaker A: Okay, so, all right, all right, all right. Like, you've nerdsniped me now. I say, like, we've. You have drawn me into your. Your, like, your own nerd snipe. And so here's my question. Like, where do we see the most practical, like, application of this, and where is it going to be, like, very clearly disruptive? You said, like, maybe the roll up thing is like, okay, is it? It doesn't seem that compelling to you? Are you excited about, like, encrypted?
00:20:48.334 - 00:21:08.290, Speaker B: I'll tell you why. The roll up thing is, like, not that interesting. It's like, I think it's interesting for, like, one or two roll ups to do it right. They, like, are completely valid in very fast time. Whatever. But I feel like it doesn't. Like, if there's going to be 100 ZK rollups, the ZK part just gets.
00:21:08.290 - 00:21:41.232, Speaker B: You forget about it gets turned into these aggregation, these aggregation proofs and whatever. And the end user doesn't. The end user benefits. In fact, the end user is harmed by knowing how that works. In fact, they're better off never fucking knowing that there is that, right? Like, even though it's like, very useful for infrastructure providers and, like, wallets and people in the middle, you know, in between, like, people who control the user experience, between the end user and the actual chains, like wallet, telegram, bot, whatever, for them it's extremely useful.
00:21:41.288 - 00:21:41.480, Speaker A: Right?
00:21:41.512 - 00:23:17.556, Speaker B: Like, that's how they can give you guarantees, but the end user doesn't give a shit, right? Whereas, like, the AI thing is that, like, you kind of need to feel like you're getting something more direct. In that sense, the end user needs to feel that way. But, yeah, what things are useful? I think one sandbag example that I remember when I was in undergrad and, like, fully homomorphic encryption, which you can think is like one step beyond ZK, was first sort of figured out, but I think is actually like a kind of useful one. If the speed of this stuff ever became fast enough is right now, there's a lot of, like, when you use something like 23 andme, you're basically trusting them to not share any of your, uh, genetic data, um, or leak any of it. But then, you know, obviously they aggregate your data with other peoples and say, like, oh, like 90% of people have this gene for this disease, blah, blah, blah, right? But what has been shown many times is that, like, you can identify pretty directly, um, certain subpopulations and in some cases, direct individuals from the aggregation. So, like, I take everyone whose anon name starts with a g, and imagine I sequenced them, and I looked at the probability that they had some gene associated with sickle cell anemia. And then I did that for the overall population at large.
00:23:17.556 - 00:24:32.342, Speaker B: From the difference of those two, I can identify that the people whose anon names are the g tend to be higher sickle cell carriers. And if there are not many anons whose name starts with a g, then I can potentially identify a single individual. The idea that you use these kind of services with your medical data without it being able to be both encrypted but also operated on, someone can do some computation on it and give an aggregate statistic that is the type of thing that ZK and fhe are very good for, is like, you commit to some data, say it's your genome sequence. Some company says, hey, I want to aggregate this and figure out some population statistics for some drug I'm making. And they are able to do that without ever knowing or revealing your particular trait, because you don't want everyone to know you have whatever disease. I chose sickle cell for a random reason, but it's just because it has such a clear genetic marker, I guess. Okay, so I think that type of stuff in biology is actually way will be more important because almost everyone's.
00:24:32.342 - 00:25:12.574, Speaker B: Everyone's leaving their DNA everywhere nowadays, and sequencing is so cheap that, like, finding. Well, I guess it sounds funny when you say everyone's looking their DNA, but it is true, right? It's like you kind of need very low amount of sample size now. Like, I, like, licked a cup for people to be able to partially sequence. And so I think in a world where, like, you want some control over your medical data, this type of stuff is useful. Now, that's a completely not blockchain thing, but blockchains. But token people are funding that. All of your degen shitcoiner is funding making that stuff better.
00:25:12.574 - 00:25:18.074, Speaker B: It's a form of effective altruism effect. It's like. Yeah, it's effective altruism in some way.
00:25:18.494 - 00:25:21.038, Speaker A: Okay, this is. All right, all right, let's get. Let's. You're.
00:25:21.086 - 00:25:22.470, Speaker B: We went off the rails. I apologize.
00:25:22.502 - 00:25:26.754, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's like, way too nerd sniped. All right, let's talk about meme coins.
00:25:27.694 - 00:25:38.194, Speaker B: All right. You know, someone's got a. Someone's got a. You know, what's the phrase that that guy said? Keep fucking that chicken. Someone's got to do that.
00:25:39.054 - 00:25:54.734, Speaker A: Yeah, well, okay, well, we can kind of tie this in. I assume you've been, like, paying attention to the Solana fees. Well, first of all, can. Can Solana. Can Solana fix its fees? Yeah.
00:25:56.634 - 00:26:45.614, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, I think obviously, they're having a lot of things that are confounding this right now, which is like a. They're having these networking issues. I think there's a lot of things hidden in those networking issues. Some of them are this peer discovery thing of, how do I find the leader, who's the leader for the next x slots so that I can send them my transactions? Because there's no mempool. And obviously that naturally leads to a spam problem at the networking layer. Salon also made a bunch of choices of using particular networking stacks that were maybe not as mature. And I got some flame on Twitter for saying that, but whatever that.
00:26:45.614 - 00:27:11.000, Speaker B: I don't know what to say. It's kind of true. Like, you go read the fucking literature. It's not like these things have been used in many places. And I think the networking stuff is actually much worse than the fee congestion. The networking stuff is sort of implicitly causing some of the congestion because of how bad it is. It's just cheaper to spam.
00:27:11.000 - 00:27:55.754, Speaker B: And then once people start spamming, they kind of make the network congestion worse, like the networking side worse, which then causes more spam. And so this feedback loop between the networking to send your transaction is not working. So you just start resending your transaction 500 times. And so that's a bad feedback loop. I obviously think they should be doing. I guess you had Eugene recently on this podcast, so I obviously think they should be doing some type of dynamic fees. I think there's this one group of Solana land that's anarchic and just thinks you should never have any fee regulation, EIP 5259 type of stuff.
00:27:55.754 - 00:28:32.344, Speaker B: It doesn't even have to be like that. It can be anything that sort of just adjusts the minimum fee as a function of demand. There's definitely a large portion of the salonic community that is extremely anarchic. They seem to not. They're like, oh, the market should always be setting fees on its own. Well, it's like, yeah, in a normal market, a seller tells you their fee, and in this case, the sellers have no ability, the sellers, being the validators who are selling you the space, have no ability to tell you the fucking fee. And so, like, unless you have one of these mechanisms, you're never going to.
00:28:32.344 - 00:28:47.184, Speaker B: You're always going to have, like, the supply demand that mismatch. And the anarchic people, I think, don't totally see that. I mean, I think now they're starting to, but they sort of still have not seen the light fully.
00:28:47.344 - 00:28:50.284, Speaker A: Okay, so go ahead.
00:28:50.824 - 00:28:56.020, Speaker B: So I guess your question is, like, what will, can they fix it? Is that what you're going to get to next?
00:28:56.132 - 00:28:59.156, Speaker A: Yeah, basically, yeah.
00:28:59.220 - 00:30:15.104, Speaker B: So my suspicion is that they can fix it to get to a certain amount of throughput. But I suspect, architecturally, they're going to have to, like, change a lot of things if they want to, like ten x their throughput. Like, I imagine they can get back to where they were. And in terms of transaction throughput with the fix, I don't think they can five to ten x their transaction throughput, max transaction throughput in the current architecture. That being said, I think there are things that are like Solana, like Sui or Monad, where they actually do have slightly different notions of how they do transaction dispatching. And I think one very dirty iq way of describing how to think about some of these alternative architectures is you get a bunch of transactions in, you get a huge amount of demand. Right now in Solana, what it does is it has a scheduler which sort of tries to choose, hey, these transactions don't interact with each other, so they can be in different processors and these ones do.
00:30:15.104 - 00:31:32.804, Speaker B: The problem with that is if someone is spamming the same area, the same state, and there's no increase in cost to them, then suddenly those things that are supposed to be independent, there's not many of them, everyone is touching the same state, and you degenerate to just one core. The spamming thing is actually a way of people manipulating how the scheduler works. That's one way of thinking about it, because the scheduler can maximally use all your throughput and hardware and stuff. If these transactions are all touching different state and they're not interacting with each other. But if I'm spamming and sending the same transaction over and over and over, then the scheduler can't separate those. Now, what it could do, and this is, you can think of what Swe does to some extent, is when multiple things touch the same state at some level, instead of it running them sequentially, it makes a copy, runs in parallel, and then merges them back. And a 30 IQ way of thinking of what that's doing is it's making almost like a separate roll up for the same state for some tiny amount of time, and then merging them or killing the two and merging them back.
00:31:32.804 - 00:32:17.874, Speaker B: And that type of architecture places a lot of constraints on how you program things and stuff like that. I think some of the optimizations Solana does for low latency stuff may not be easy to mix with that. But my point is, I do think there are ways of getting to that type of thing architecturally in the long run. I just, I'm not sure if it's like, you can do it in Solana without big changes, if that makes sense. Yeah, like big kind of rewrite. And I think, like, yeah, swee is actually, you know, sweet and aptos and stuff. I think that there's a lot to learn from what they did.
00:32:17.874 - 00:32:35.596, Speaker B: That being said, they have no riz. So, like, I don't understand how it's, you know, those, those are like, I don't know why the move chains, it's just like, kind of weird to me. Like, they actually have, they actually have great technology, but, like, man, no one wants to build a meme coin there. It's like, it, it's just like everyone's.
00:32:35.620 - 00:32:45.892, Speaker A: Like, yeah, but I think a lot, like, I think. I don't know. Honestly, I don't know much about, is it swee or. Okay, sweet.
00:32:45.948 - 00:32:46.704, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:32:47.244 - 00:32:47.572, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:47.588 - 00:32:48.124, Speaker B: You don't either?
00:32:48.164 - 00:32:48.944, Speaker A: Okay, good.
00:32:50.604 - 00:32:53.388, Speaker B: I did invest in mistin labs when they were called.
00:32:53.436 - 00:33:06.264, Speaker A: Yeah. See, I think this is why, like, I mean, to be honest, it just, they seem like high FTV, like, low float coins. I don't know. I mean, that, that's the vibes I get from crypto Twitter. Maybe crypto Twitter isn't, like, such a good.
00:33:07.684 - 00:34:09.572, Speaker B: I think their code base is actually great. There's a lot of interesting architectural stuff they've done in how they manage their mempool. So they have this kind of, like, they have this sort of, like, like I was saying, like, one very dumb way of thinking about it is like, you could think of their mempool as being like, oh, there's a lot of congestion. We're going to make a roll up on demand, run the same calculation in two separate places, and then try to merge them. And if you put enough constraints on the calculations, in fact, the name of their programming language, which is move, is like a way of enforcing some of those constraints such that you have a way of merging. Because if I take the same transaction, I run in parallel, if I don't have a way of merging them, or, like, there's many possible ways, then I can have, like, this kind of, like, deterministic execution that I can verify very easily. And so, you know, I think, like, the, the sui world part of the world has actually thought a lot about these problems.
00:34:09.572 - 00:35:14.246, Speaker B: And it's not that Solana hasn't. Right. The Solana scheduler upgrades are, are trying to do things of this fan. Um, I just think, like, the, you kind of have to rewrite, at least from, you know, and again, I should caveat with, like, most of my Solana programming experience came from, like, around Christmas, I had a week off, and I just was, like, writing some Solana programs and playing with the scheduler and writing tests and trying to, like, understand how it worked. So, like, I wouldn't say I'm an expert on, at all, by any means, on the, the whole node, but I do think there's stuff they can do. I just don't think they're going to be able to get enough stuff to get to Ten X, whereas I actually think Sui and Aptos architecture is closer in the long run. And I think Monad is trying to take the best of both worlds in terms of how they're thinking about execution, optimistic execution and stuff like that.
00:35:14.246 - 00:35:46.688, Speaker B: So. Yeah, but again, the real problem is, like, Solana has a real demand, right? They have a fucking wall usable and like, all this stuff. So I think, like, there's no way you can fade the Solana ecosystem at all. I just think it's. I think they'll have to make large changes architecturally to. To get to ten x the throughput or something. Thanks for listening to the Gort show on the Blockspace podcast network.

00:35:58.184 - 00:36:05.484, Speaker A: So you do a lot of work in Defi governance. What is the state of DeFi governance? Is it, like, we're making progress?
00:36:06.754 - 00:36:58.766, Speaker B: Um, okay. I think as much as, uh, as much as, uh, maker gets a lot of shit, I do think, like, they have been the most to push the envelope in terms of subdaos, in terms of rune talking about, like, AI is running the subdaos, whatever. I do really think maker. Maker doesn't get enough credit and, like, people love shitting on it, but, like, I don't know, it's sort of like beautiful dysfunction in some ways. I think defi governance, in the long run, you'll inevitably have some form of specialization. Like, the subdaos are one form of that. Or, like, you know, it really depends on the tasks the Dow needs to do, right? Like, fundamentally, there's some tasks that are common to all daos, like treasury management.
00:36:58.766 - 00:38:13.104, Speaker B: Like, how do we make sure our treasury is allocated correctly and that we have enough Runway for whatever. Some tasks are very specific to a particular DAO. Like, risk management for a perpetual protocol is different than for updating the risk limits is very different than risk management for a lending protocol. And then in some cases, it's not totally clear what the DAO and the protocol are, how they are supposed to be related, which is often true for dexs, because what are you governing other than upgrades to new stuff or maybe changing a fees fee model or something, which is just an upgrade. So I think there's definitely that. I think the other part is daos are just hard to be organizationally. It's hard for them to figure out how to have efficient organizational structure, because oftentimes it's not like the oldest members of a DAO are the most capable or have the right specialties, especially as things evolve.
00:38:13.104 - 00:39:11.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I think it's chugging along and people are finding different modalities where, like, there's some things that are trying to be much more governance minimized and then just have different roles for particular actors, there's some things that are trying to stick to the, like, hey, where it's like one big Dao, everyone votes. And then there's also, like, Solana Daos, which I mean, if you look at, like, the voting participation in, like, Jupiter, it's like, unreal how high it is compared to, like, everywhere else. Uh, and I think, like, there's some lessons in how communities are run in. In different ecosystems that is like, really, like, I think a lot of ethereum daos could learn a lot from Solana Daos, which I just, like, they're just run very differently. And I think, like, just going to the community calls, you're like, holy shit. Like, some of these are, like, professional, which is like, kind of wild.
00:39:11.838 - 00:39:51.344, Speaker B: So I feel like the daos you always read about on crypto Twitter are the ones that are having all these infights and dysfunctionality and whatever. But there are a lot of examples where I'm blown away by how high the participation rate is and stuff like that, and how much they've created these working groups or subdaos and those things have worked. And this is why I think, yeah, look, maker says has had some crazy things happen, said some great, but they kind of, we're always ahead of the curve on this type of stuff before everyone else. And, you know, you have to give them some credit for that. And, you know, I think, like, sometimes people, people forget that it's, like, hard to be the first one.
00:39:51.964 - 00:39:58.224, Speaker A: Yeah, but I mean, how do you feel just in general? Like, is that sugar free Red Bull?
00:39:59.244 - 00:40:05.786, Speaker B: No, I'm cheating on sugar free Red Bull. It's Celsius. I'm just out of Red Bull. I need to go buy some.
00:40:05.980 - 00:40:55.642, Speaker A: Dude, I'll cut that from the video. All right, just zoom way out and be honest. Is token governance the long run of all of this stuff? And is that what we should be trying to optimize for? Like you said? Okay, maybe there's some protocols that have. They're trying to be, like, governance minimized and then, I don't know, does this actually work in practice? Actually, you know what, I'm just going to ask you. Let me phrase this a different way. Maybe it's not exactly the same question, but, like, do you think there are examples of projects, and I know you just brought up maker and that's why I asked this, that through tokens, decentralized over time. Like, this is one of these first principles that you hear all the time, right? Like, oh, you like, launch a token because it helps to decentralize over time.
00:40:55.642 - 00:41:17.086, Speaker A: Like, is this actually true in practice? Like, do we have a single example? I think maker was often brought up right as an example of this. But, I mean, look, whether maybe. Maybe it's a good idea what they're doing. I don't know. I haven't, like, really followed the whole, like, rune reentrancy arc to the sub dial to, like. But, like, I don't know. I guess.
00:41:17.086 - 00:41:28.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll. I'll leave it. I'll leave the question at that. Like, is this. Is this a first principle that we can say, yes, this actually occurs in practice. Tokens decentralized governance over time.
00:41:32.014 - 00:41:41.262, Speaker B: I think just like all capitalism, there's inevitably an incentive to concentrate.
00:41:41.438 - 00:41:42.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:42.814 - 00:42:53.200, Speaker B: And I think the real question is, do tokens decentralize more than traditional equity instruments? And I think that is undoubtedly true. I feel like you can see these hostile takeovers by the community even before they have a token in some cases where there's still a lot of input, and it's also pretty transparent. Whereas I look at a cap table, even of a us stock, and oftentimes I have no fucking clue what the true ownership structure is. There's just 500 LLCs and the Maldives and Caymans that own 80% of it. And, like, you know, you really have, like, a hard time understanding, like, the voting structures and stuff like that. So I. And if, as an example of, like, corporate governance charade, look at the recent Disney hostile takeover failed attempt, where, like, a bunch of people tried to oust the Disney CEO, and then it was like this.
00:42:53.200 - 00:43:29.364, Speaker B: Like, it was apparently the most expensive corporate boardroom takeover in history. Like, almost like 100 or $200 million was spent on the lobbying of the different voters. So I would say there's this benefit, transparency. Now, does the idealistic Kumbaya, I believe, in constitution dao type of shit happen? Of course not. How idiotic do you have to believe that? I mean, it's still capitalism. Like, that's the fundamental thing. I think people forget about crypto is, like, just because it's making it more fair doesn't mean it's totally, you know, like.
00:43:29.364 - 00:43:49.198, Speaker B: And I think. I think, like, that's sort of the thing. I think people's expectations were set incorrectly. But then if I compare it to, like, the normal market and the normal finance world, I'm like, this is clearly better. So, like, I prefer that view of the world that, like, it's incrementally better, right? And, like, yeah, but I think.
00:43:49.246 - 00:44:55.720, Speaker A: Okay, all right. I would say, like, ideally, the definition of decentralization one of the key attributes of decentralization to the extent that we strive for this, is that it mitigates the risk of a relatively small number of people changing the rules or doing something against the greater consensus. And the thing is with, with token voting, like token governance, like, you really just have to have more money and like, and we have, like maybe you can give, like, I'm sure you can give counter examples where like the community has fought back, but we've certainly seen like a small number of VC's push something through because it, it benefits them. Like, I mean, I think that this is sort of undeniable in practice. So I don't know, like if, if I think it is a little bit like the decentralization of ownership of a protocol. Like, I wonder if maybe the problem is that people own the protocol, like, to begin with. I don't know if you have any like philosophies and thoughts on this.
00:44:55.752 - 00:45:00.680, Speaker B: I mean, if you look at layer ones, arguably you still have the same difference, right?
00:45:00.712 - 00:45:04.568, Speaker A: That's different. Well, no, no, I think it's different. Like it, but I'm saying there's still.
00:45:04.616 - 00:46:15.726, Speaker B: Concentration, there's still concentration effects, right? Like the point is, in capitalist systems where youre pricing the value of a particular asset and its control over future decisions, you inevitably have this decision where there are people who just want to not participate and just get dividends and not own much, and then people who want to own huge stakes so they can control the thing. If youre really decentralized, you should have the freedom to concentrate or not concentrate as well in a way that's different than the normal market where it's like a government can impose. You can't own more than 5% or you must own at least 2% to participate type of thing. I just sort of think, yes, there's these examples where they get very sandbagged and controlled. That's also true in the normal market world. But I think it's very transparent that that's happening when it happens in crypto versus like in the normal market. It's like so hard to see.
00:46:15.726 - 00:46:31.342, Speaker B: I don't know if you, do you remember there was this scandal over this company that was in India and like it had this like 200% price increase to get to like, yeah, I think.
00:46:31.358 - 00:46:32.518, Speaker A: I heard about this.
00:46:32.686 - 00:46:52.494, Speaker B: Yeah. And, and then it just turned out it was like they, they were like rehypothecating their shares like a million times and just buying more. I was like the, the net leverage on the stock was like insane, but no one knew it was leverage from the same person because like, of all the weird shell companies or whatever. And then it kind of like it was one of those like Hindenburg research things that kind of.
00:46:52.574 - 00:46:53.954, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:46:55.464 - 00:47:17.244, Speaker B: And my point is, like, this stuff is better than that. You can figure that out faster. The Hindenburg of crypto can do it with way less effort and that's a sign of an improvement. But it's incremental. It's not this, like, ah, like we're fucking socialist, whatever. Which I think is the problem that people like, expect that when it's not that.
00:47:18.024 - 00:47:53.182, Speaker A: I think my, my only counter, it's not really like so much in disagreement. But I think that often, at least the way that I see, it's like a lot of times these protocols, they say, well, there's no other way than token governance. You have to be able to do this and you have to be able to make these changes and upgrades. Maybe that's functionally true for how these specific systems are built. There are open source software protocols that don't have token governance. That's true. They need them because everybody has designed them that way.
00:47:53.182 - 00:48:03.314, Speaker A: In the same sense that you need a token, mainly because if you don't, somebody else will do what you're doing and have a token. It's sort of like the game theory of it.
00:48:03.974 - 00:48:22.470, Speaker B: Okay, well, but that's true in the normal market too, right? If you don't raise VC or private equity and your competitor does, and they take market share because they can, it's the same. It's not so different. It's just that form of subsidy. It's a different form of subsidy.
00:48:22.582 - 00:48:31.822, Speaker A: I don't disagree. But I guess what I'm saying is, like, I personally, like my personal view here has been that there's been like somewhat of a bastardization of the terminology protocol. Right?
00:48:31.918 - 00:48:34.638, Speaker B: Like, yeah, yeah, no doubt about.
00:48:34.686 - 00:48:34.886, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:34.910 - 00:48:40.510, Speaker B: There's a lot of things that would be better without the token. The product would be better without the token.
00:48:40.622 - 00:48:45.398, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. And that's why I sort of like pressed you or. Yeah, I asked, is there an example?
00:48:45.486 - 00:49:01.104, Speaker B: Some of those, some of those. The tokens doesn't even barely does any governance. In fact, the token just exists solely for this, like anti competitive. Like, I want to subsidize people using my thing. Yeah, but no one wants to say that because that's like definitely a security.
00:49:01.924 - 00:49:27.340, Speaker A: Right, exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm going to move on to slightly, slightly different subjects. Actually. Quite, quite a different subject. All right, so this is like, honestly why? I feel like I do have a tremendous amount of respect for you. Well, there are other reasons, but like, this, specifically, you did this debate, like, three years ago, four years ago.
00:49:27.340 - 00:49:31.052, Speaker A: Now, I don't know how long ago. It was quite a while. It was proof of work.
00:49:31.108 - 00:49:33.084, Speaker B: It was like the pandemic. It was like 2020.
00:49:33.124 - 00:50:05.196, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. All right. You did a debate on proof of work was proof of stake with this guy from Avalanche, and you took the proof of work side. You said a lot of interesting things. One interesting thing I thought you said, well, like, I guess I can start this this way, is you said that proof of work is the only way to make good money, specifically money. Do you still stand by this? I'm paraphrasing, but that is what you said, so don't try to walk us back now. You cannot stand by it.
00:50:05.196 - 00:50:08.716, Speaker A: But I. I went back and listened and I made sure you said that. So go ahead.
00:50:08.780 - 00:50:45.060, Speaker B: My. My main arguments for my proof of work is better kind of machine for this type of stuff is the following. I mean, I always. I think in that episode, if I remember correctly, I made the claim like, PoW is like money, pos is like us equities. And then all these other weaker things are like shitty sovereign bonds, like, okay, stuff like that. Other things meaning, like the filecoin, proof of space time, all these other, like, kind of alt consensus mechanisms are like the real shit tier financial asset. It's not their fault.
00:50:45.060 - 00:51:24.808, Speaker B: It's just like, there are things whose demand distribution is not constant, but the real reason is a couple things. So I think I fell down this rabbit hole in 2019 when I wrote this paper where I basically said, do the following thought experiment. And so I remember at that time in 2019, the only live POS network was Tezos. So that's like, how people were still, like, building the stuff. Like Avalanche hasn't launched, for instance. And that's why everyone was debating this host. But think of the following thought experiment.
00:51:24.808 - 00:52:08.514, Speaker B: I have 100 ETH. I can either stake it or I can put it in a lending protocol. To me, they're both yield. Say the lending protocol is offering 10% and the staking protocol is offering 5%. Imagine I'm, instead of all of the assumptions within proof of stake, proof of work, et cetera, are either things like honest majority, at least 51% are honest, or less than one third are byzantine, arbitrarily bad. But none of these threat models, even to some extent still today, assume that the agents are rational. They're just like, I'm just going to chase whatever yield is the highest with the lowest risk profile.
00:52:08.514 - 00:52:48.664, Speaker B: So I wrote this paper where I made this model of like, and this was like when compound had like 50 million tvl, this is like very defi, Uniswap had less than 100 mil tvl. It was like a very, maybe even less than that, probably like 80. So it was sort of like the early days of Defi. And people were like, the idea that staking yield and defi yield could be comparable was people were like, there's no way that would happen. Obviously. Now that's not true. But the idea was like, hey, let's suppose we have a bunch of validators who are rational, so they can either decide to keep their money in stake or in lending.
00:52:48.664 - 00:53:35.554, Speaker B: And then the question is, as a function of the inflation curve, how do they allocate? And basically what I showed is that this result, which is as long as there's enough demand to short over time, like a minimum threshold of how much people want to be short the staking asset, there's always going to be some yield from the lending protocol that's positive. And so if you have a bitcoin deflationary curve, eventually everyone unstakes and goes into lending. Because why would they keep staking? Because this, the lending yield is always going to be, there's some threshold point at which the demand to short the staking asset is just way higher than any yield the protocol gives you. If it has this kind of like decaying inflation curve. Does that make sense?
00:53:35.714 - 00:53:36.574, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:53:36.914 - 00:54:05.542, Speaker B: And so for proof of stake assets, you have to have this like inflating, perpetually inflating curve. Right? In proof of work, it's a little bit harder. So the real reason it's harder is in proof of stake. The fact that I can move the asset that is securing the network is also the asset that I'm using to borrow is different than in proof of work, where the asset that is securing the network, that is the hardware and power. It's exogenous. It's exogenous. You have to borrow against that.
00:54:05.542 - 00:54:38.996, Speaker B: And there's this latency and price difference. To borrow against that asset versus the main asset, you can support these deflationary curves for much longer in that type of world. So that was my financial argument. The second argument is these timing games and identities. So in most proof of stake systems, now there's this stuff called, actually, we'll get back to the other stuff. Most proof of stake systems, there's a notion of an epoch. So you lock up your stake for an epoch in order to participate.
00:54:38.996 - 00:55:35.264, Speaker B: And then you have this, what's called a verifiable random function that chooses at proportional to your stake whether you win the next block, assuming it's a single leader type of thing, which is like most of them. And the thing is, you have your identities, your address has to be staked at the beginning of the epoch in order to sample this distribution correctly. That means everyone who's possible to be drawn over the next say, let's say an epoch is 1000 blocks over the next thousand blocks. You know who is possible in POW. That's not true. Anyone can join and leave whenever they want. Like you can turn off your mining rig and now you've, that means you've increased the probability to some extent of someone else winning, because the difficulty adjustment should go down if I shut up, like some amount, if I shut off my hardware.
00:55:35.264 - 00:56:30.980, Speaker B: So there's kind of this thing called, and this is called this property that people can join and leave whenever they want, versus having to be fixed at intervals, or like identity is known. It's called dynamic availability. I had this intuition and a bunch of people at that time, we all had this intuition that proof of state can't be made dynamically available. Tim Rothgarden proved it recently, that like there's kind of this impossibility result, that proof of stake can't be like people can't join and leave if they join and leave, like the other properties of the network. Like go away. Like you don't get the two thirds honest kind of safety and liveness result, right? And so basically what this says is like, okay, PoW also has this kind of interesting property that people can join and leave whenever they want, which, which is you don't get finality. So you don't get like exact finality.
00:56:30.980 - 00:57:29.474, Speaker B: You have to do the x blocks with high probability, it's confirmed thing, but you allow people to join and we now there's a wrinkle to this, which is if you have homomorphic encryption, the thing I was talking about earlier, then you can do this type of thing which is called single secret leader election, where people commit the amount of stake they want privately. Then you can imagine that there's this function that can operate on the encrypted stake. So it doesn't know what everyone's stake is, but it's able to select a random person without knowing everyone, which is what POW is doing. It's like everyone is committing their hash power. And there's this oracle that's randomly choosing one of them. With fhe you can emulate a lot of POW and pos, but it's, no one knows how to do it in practice. There have been very, I think theorem foundation even gives out grants for people trying to do it, but it's still not practical.
00:57:29.474 - 00:57:58.322, Speaker B: So, long story short, the second thing about POW is dynamic availability. I think that's quite important to have validators or miners be able to join and leave whenever. I think that's important if you're going to be money, if the state is able to shut down a lot of these portion of Aldridge. And then the third thing is timing attacks and MeV. And this is actually kind of related to this availability thing.
00:57:58.498 - 00:58:00.266, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like deterministic.
00:58:00.410 - 00:59:11.434, Speaker B: Is that what you're deterministic ish enough that it's like a small enough set that I could simulate all of the possible people, proposers and then ddos them. And I remember this was happening on like Avalanche and maybe Solana during 2021 prior to them having MeV auctions, where people would just message they knew the validators for the whole epoch in advance, and then they would just message them and send them transactions to be put in. There's this idea that these timing attacks that people are also showing in Ethereum are strictly due to the fact that, you know, the entire set of validators who could be selected for the next x blocks, whereas, like I said, in proof of work, they can join and leave more freely. And because of that, Mev becomes easier to do. It's lower risk because you don't have any risk of people joining and leaving. And so that extra sort of, there is some extra costs that the users are paying effectively for that, even though it's not realized immediately. So those are my three reasons of why I think POW is just stronger as money.
00:59:11.434 - 00:59:48.734, Speaker B: The first is more a function of, well, can it survive attacks against the coin, like people trying to manipulate the coin price to get people to remove security from the network? In POW, it's really hard. Yes, you could manipulate the coin price, but that doesn't immediately translate to the hardware cost going up or down. Right. Whereas in proof of stake, they are the same asset, so that financially it's hard. And then the other thing is these, like, censorship slash Mev cost things. So I stand by the statement. So this way.
00:59:49.034 - 01:00:13.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm glad you stand by it. Okay, so have you fall? I want to ask you about, like, the issuance curve stuff recently. Have you followed it? You said you haven't followed it, like, so closely. You said that to me. But I want to hear like, I don't know what I guess what I. What I want to know is like, is there a way to optimize amount staked with yield in a proof of stake system that's not centralizing?
01:00:15.894 - 01:01:48.670, Speaker B: Um, I think this gets back again to the, this type of like, financial thing earlier about like, and then that was only focused on like, network security and like, you know, like, you know, I proved some theorems and whatever about that, but like, that's a particular subcase of this. There is this inherent thing where proof of stake issuance is always competing with the yield of its applications very directly, right? And proof of work yield is like, not, again, for the same kind of reasons of like, the asset you're producing and the resource you're locking up are different, and that means they won't be perfectly synchronized. So inevitably, I actually think your issuance does have to change in regards to alternative yield sources. So the dumbest example is, suppose all the on chain yields are yielding ten basis points of yield, and all of the proof of stake staking yields are like 10%. Then you're clearly overpaying for the inflation rate because the opportunity cost is so much lower to switch. On the other hand, if the lending and Athena or whatever rate you want to use as your benchmark is much higher than staking rate, you're inevitably going to bleed security out to those. In theory, you should be dynamically adjusting.
01:01:48.670 - 01:02:29.504, Speaker B: Now, in practice, it's like how the fuck you're trying to bootstrap a network. If you keep thrashing the stake, people have no fucking certainty. And then it doesn't feel like it's closer to money. You lose this moneyness property. And I think in some ways this is why I personally think things like restaking are actually a better way of modifying the issuance curve. Obviously they have these security and risk issues, but let's just in some ways, because you effectively have. Imagine that we take my initial example where I said there is 10% staking inflation, and say lets call it 1% lending inflation.
01:02:29.504 - 01:02:56.044, Speaker B: Now that means I could lower my staking inflation up to just a little more than the lending. Lets call it 1.5. It needs to be over collateralized by some amount. That means I have 8.5% of stake. That's like way over collateralized. And you could imagine lending that out to other networks to use, provided that it's above the opportunity cost of unstaking.
01:02:56.044 - 01:03:41.522, Speaker B: Because you want people to keep their stake in for security, but you also don't want to overpay. And so if somehow they can lend it out, then you're able to be at that threshold. And I think you should, you know, restaking is not lending. So it's not exactly the same. But I'm trying to just give that analogy because that is a market driven way to pick the inflation curve without mutating the mate based network inflation, because it implicitly is changing the inflation curve there, right. The extra stake that's restaked, like if it got slashed or if it got more rewards, like it does mutate, like how much security is actually in the base network, do you think, I wanted.
01:03:41.538 - 01:03:54.174, Speaker A: To ask you this. Do you think that Ethereum fully realized the extent that restaking was going to be sort of like one of these new primitives?
01:03:55.754 - 01:05:04.760, Speaker B: Um, it's a good question. I mean, to be honest, ethereum with restaking is a little bit like Polkadot, where Polkadot's main chain, the idea that you're paying an ETH to the same validator set is very similar, except in Polkadot's case, they have these auctions and stuff like that versus how restaking works. So I would say things that are similar were certainly thought of. And I think in the early sharding designs, that was kind of, they lend some similarity. I think the thing about restaking is, from a financial standpoint, not from the cryptographic or distributed system standpoint, is it does let you do this kind of issuance curve modification implicitly, if that makes sense. And like the market is choosing whether to do it as opposed to like, you setting it. And I think, I don't think that is the thing that people who are working on this issuance stuff realize.
01:05:04.760 - 01:05:09.844, Speaker B: Or is that like the market has made all these other ways of implicitly changing.
01:05:10.184 - 01:05:20.418, Speaker A: Yeah, but, but it's still like, okay, so, but what this doesn't remove is the initial centralization of stake, right? Like that's so, so, like, okay, so.
01:05:20.426 - 01:06:09.344, Speaker B: Then what is, although it does mean that the initial central, you know, what are you doing? You're lending your stake to, you can think of it as like I'm giving a node operator who's running an AV's my stake and they're earning interest on it and then splitting it with me, right? Like that is one of these things that's sort of like it's, it is technically, it is definitely still centralized, but you're now allowing new operators to like participate and earn yield with your capital. So I agree it doesn't remove that, but it does lower the barrier to joining. Like if I'm an AV's node operator, I can now get capital easily. Right. And yeah, it doesn't change the full centralization story, but it does mean people have access to earning yield.
01:06:11.204 - 01:06:24.956, Speaker A: Does. Do you still think under this model, I would assume yes, but do you still think under this model, like, the vast majority of ETH ends up staked in some capacity, like, however, Abs, whatever.
01:06:25.060 - 01:06:29.052, Speaker B: This kind of, like, everyone talking about this target threshold, whatever stuff.
01:06:29.108 - 01:06:29.744, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:34.884 - 01:06:51.422, Speaker B: ETH is kind of weird. I think the transition from POW to POS made people, a lot of users of ETH, like, especially in Asia, who are like large holders, not used to locking up their assets that way.
01:06:51.478 - 01:06:52.206, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:52.390 - 01:07:24.740, Speaker B: Right. They're just not used to this unbonding time, not being able to get out quickly, whatever. And obviously there's synthetic ways of doing those, borrowing against my staked assets, whatever. That's why the staked ETH lending markets are so big. But I think in Ethereum, there's a lot of unsophisticated users who have a lot of ethereum from a long time ago who don't like the lockup type of stuff. And I think there's, if that amount has to be at least 20% to 30% of supply, whereas in Solana, that's not true. Right.
01:07:24.740 - 01:07:26.388, Speaker B: Like, it started, proof of stake, everyone.
01:07:26.436 - 01:07:38.508, Speaker A: Like, you think 20% to 30% of people will be okay with unsafe ETH because they're just like, have some type of, I don't know, they just like.
01:07:38.556 - 01:07:47.584, Speaker B: They don't like the idea of trade liquidity stuff. Like, I think ETH is used in trading so much that, like, there's other forms of yield that, that have no lockup time.
01:07:48.204 - 01:08:00.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, in theory, right, like, all these applications should, should like converge on the same as staking, like staking yield. So, like, it's not like, yeah, so, but I'm just interested, they might have.
01:08:00.844 - 01:08:05.364, Speaker B: Different, they, they'll have, they should converge close to it, but there's some duration discount, right?
01:08:05.404 - 01:08:06.284, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:08:06.444 - 01:09:01.890, Speaker B: Or premium. Like, the fact that I don't have to wait means that, and my point is, I think ETH is so integrated off chain, and people think of its usage off chain a lot, that there's a large percentage that's doing the basis trade on centralized exchanges, large percentage that's facilitating other OTC stuff. And it's a trading pair for a lot of shitcoins off chain. So I feel like ETH is, and also there's a lot of treasuries that people have where they're not putting all of it into staking. I think there's kind of a sense in which ETH is sort of a special animal in that going from POW to Pos meant that people, there's enough of a portion of the supply that's used to the free liquidity versus Solana. When people bought in, they were like, okay, yeah. In order to earn any yield on this thing until it grows.
01:09:01.890 - 01:09:10.336, Speaker B: I'm not talking now. I'm talking when it started. I have to lock it up. You know, like, there's like, this psychological difference between the two that makes sense.
01:09:10.360 - 01:09:25.448, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's interesting. I. But that kind of goes to maybe the notion that, like, tinkering with this targeted stake rate is, like, not so optimal. But I do want to ask you then, like, this is how I think about it, right? Like people are saying, I think I.
01:09:25.456 - 01:09:59.304, Speaker B: Don'T know how to measure that elasticity of those people. Right? Like, yeah, here's the dumbest thing. Like, all of these analyses are making some very. Some assumption implicitly of some notion of elasticity as a function of how much I change the inflation curve, how much do people change their stake rate, how much do people change their basis trade percentage? And that sort of, that change in x divided by change in interest rate thing, that elasticity is very hard to measure in this scenario. So.
01:09:59.344 - 01:10:17.432, Speaker A: Yeah, and, like, there's even a little bit of, like, precedent with not. Not exactly the same thing, but there's a little bit of precedent with that. Like, just looking at how much ETH is in Coinbase. Like, like, is. Is using Coinbase, and they are, like, much, much higher fees than lido. Right? Like, so, I mean, no, it's not the exact same thing, but you're right. Like, there is some, like, like, not.
01:10:17.488 - 01:10:22.324, Speaker B: Rational, not fully rational, but like, kind of rational user.
01:10:24.304 - 01:10:24.592, Speaker A: And.
01:10:24.608 - 01:10:34.712, Speaker B: Yeah, and I just think those. It's not like Defi, where the elasticities are really easy to measure. Right? Like, you change your interest rate, you look for a day and you can see, like, a bunch of people unmove and not move their assets.
01:10:34.768 - 01:10:36.752, Speaker A: Right, okay. But. All right.
01:10:36.888 - 01:10:58.336, Speaker B: Staking is much harder because it's like you have these longer unbonding times. You have to choose a node operator. There's infrastructure. You know, you might be stuck at your centralized exchange. It defies a lot more easy barrier. It has lower barriers to entry, to join and leave for a lot of people. So it's like, you can measure this a lot better for staking.
01:10:58.336 - 01:11:01.488, Speaker B: It's very hard. That's kind of my impression.
01:11:01.536 - 01:11:03.008, Speaker A: All right, thought it could measure it. Sure.
01:11:03.056 - 01:11:06.160, Speaker B: Change issuance. But, like, I highly doubt you can measure it well enough.
01:11:06.272 - 01:11:09.644, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, thought experiment. Ethereum gets an ETF.
01:11:10.184 - 01:11:10.632, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:11:10.688 - 01:11:12.404, Speaker A: It gets a lot of inflows.
01:11:13.984 - 01:11:16.284, Speaker B: The buyers just sit at Coinbase.
01:11:16.984 - 01:11:35.684, Speaker A: Well, okay, so this is my question in terms of staking on something like that. That is where there is, like, probably passive buyers. I'm making assumptions here, of course, too. But, like, say this gets a lot of inflows. There's passive buyers. The passive buyers intend to hold for ten years. Okay.
01:11:35.684 - 01:11:58.934, Speaker A: Yeah. It's going into their 401K or whatever, Roth Ira. Okay. Those people, like, I don't know. You can do the math. Let's say that, like, yield is, like, 3% after ten years. How much purchasing power have they lost? You see what I'm saying? So, like, that's an example where I think that, uh, there, those are potential entrants that have a lot of incentive to want that staked, right?
01:11:59.954 - 01:12:55.872, Speaker B: But almost all of the staking providers, actually, even if you look at, say, the 21 shares ETF in Switzerland, they don't even stake over 50%, I believe, of the ETH. It's like an exchange traded product in Switzerland that actually stakes a bunch of its ETH. And they don't even stake more than 50% because they have to process withdrawals. So people who are, when people redeem an ETF share for ETH, they have to give them real ETH. They can't give them staked ETH. And so the unbonding time, the fact that it takes a week to unbond means that they can't afford to have all of their assets stake to process these, like, liquid, to process redemptions and do liquidity related things. This is why I'm saying there's this cost of liquidity for these assets that ensures that the staking percentage won't be 100%.
01:12:55.872 - 01:13:30.752, Speaker B: And, like, researchers have never traded, as far as I can tell, so I don't think we can. They definitely don't understand this cost of liquidity thing and any of the analyses, they all fucking miss this, and it's fine. Like, whatever. I get what? That's why I'm saying these, like, things are very hard to measure because they really depend on these, like, liquidity constraints of different things, right? Like, so here's a, here's an example. Suppose that, hey, the swiss law says that for exchange traded products, 50, only 50% can be staked for the US. They say only 25% can be staked for China or Singapore. Let's say.
01:13:30.752 - 01:14:11.104, Speaker B: They say arbitrary amount can be staked. What's equilibrium? I don't know. It's actually very hard to say because it depends on whether, like capital that's in one of the places that is getting the lower yield, like Switzerland or the US, can get to Singapore while their capital controls. I know whether that capital that is buying from an ETF, theyre not crypto users who know how to stake. Can that capital get to Singapore? And then what if it overloads the ETF and the creation redemption? ArB isnt working correctly because theres not enough market makers. Theres all these extra hidden costs to these things. And those costs give you this inelastic users who are not chasing the highest yield anymore.
01:14:11.104 - 01:14:13.404, Speaker B: They're just trying to get safe field.
01:14:14.104 - 01:14:25.440, Speaker A: I think that, think though, that like a lot of is somewhat predicated on LST's though. Like basically in. And maybe you're right, maybe there's just a lot of, like, I think these.
01:14:25.472 - 01:14:36.964, Speaker B: Regulated people can't really use lsts. They're gonna have, they're just gonna get Coinbase heath type of stuff. Like, I mean, yeah, that's interesting because they use lido, right. But like really?
01:14:37.004 - 01:14:37.940, Speaker A: I didn't know that.
01:14:38.092 - 01:14:42.604, Speaker B: Switzerland is like a weird beast where they don't, it's like kind of, you can do whatever you want. That's what.
01:14:42.644 - 01:15:06.624, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think, I guess, I guess what, I guess my only point was, like you were saying the researchers have these like ideas in mind and I think that they, they view this as like, uh, these LST is removing that. Like even the conversation of a liquidity premium or like the opportunity costs. Right. Like it just like effectively nullifies that in their minds. Yeah, maybe so, um. Well, that's interesting. It's like an interesting different perspective, I would say.
01:15:06.624 - 01:15:22.164, Speaker A: Uh. All right, I want to ask you about a couple other things. Well, actually, mainly just one other thing. Um, bitcoin, l two s robot just invested. Your venture capital firm just invested in. I don't want people to forget that you're also a vc. You don't just get to.
01:15:23.984 - 01:15:24.432, Speaker B: You don't.
01:15:24.448 - 01:15:30.744, Speaker A: Just get to be the little, uh, the little nerd on here, researcher guy. I have to consistently remind people that you're also.
01:15:30.864 - 01:15:35.080, Speaker B: I also, I do run sickening 60 person company. So it's not, it's not exactly.
01:15:35.112 - 01:15:49.444, Speaker A: No, no, I know. Okay. You guys just invested in Alpine, which is a bitcoin. L two. Yeah. I'm like, you can't see me, but I'm doing like in quotation marks. L two.
01:15:49.444 - 01:15:57.984, Speaker A: Hoping to become an l two, maybe with the right opcodes, but, yeah. What, like, what was behind this? And then also just talk to me about bitcoin.
01:15:59.004 - 01:16:29.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so, a, the alpentima is like, they're really awesome, smart ck people. They have. Their head of cryptography is someone who's been pretty prolific on some of the more recent folding papers. And actually, probably the only person I have met at Blockstream, other than Polestra, who. Yeah, he's a former blockstream guy. Yeah, yeah, so there's that. They also are just, like, very.
01:16:29.922 - 01:17:12.832, Speaker B: They've been, like, they're very earnest about, like, wanting to make ZK on bitcoin happen in a way that I think a lot of other l two teams on bitcoin are, like, just mid market asian exchange grifts that are, like, not even l two s. They're just like, send me your money to my multisig, and I will let you use my sidechain. That is a server that I'm running. Um, and I I think their thing is, like, they're very. In my mind, they're like a team that's, like, willing to wait five years for an opcode. Um, and I think, like, it's very hard to find people like that who aren't just like, oh, yeah, I'm just gonna immediately, like, I'm gonna work on the ZK thing. Okay.
01:17:12.832 - 01:17:16.444, Speaker B: It's too hard. I'm gonna do the grift roll up. Grift up.
01:17:17.064 - 01:17:19.680, Speaker A: Uh, that's good. And.
01:17:19.752 - 01:18:00.642, Speaker B: And then I just, like, just like, the team is very focused on this. They really want ZK and bitcoin. They really want other virtual machines that are optimized for ZK on bitcoin that are minimal and have a lot of the general philosophical properties, I guess, of bitcoin. I think, in general, I wish there were more people building l two s like this on bitcoin. But then again, you know, being a martyr is hard in a world filled with. Being a martyr is hard in a world filled with prostitutes who said that? There was, like, some. That's a famous quote from someone I.
01:18:00.658 - 01:18:02.374, Speaker A: Forgot, but that was Vitalik.
01:18:04.474 - 01:18:48.314, Speaker B: I don't think that was vital. Someone I'm trying to remember. Anyway, whatever that, I think, like, you know, in my mind, there is a chance for these stark based bitcoin l two s to actually be l two s and not have make a compromise on where the data is and what transaction types are allowed and whether it's really just a multisig in disguise. Yeah, it's just. Yeah. And that's the exciting thing about them, so that they're into that.
01:18:48.614 - 01:18:58.518, Speaker A: Okay. So to that end, I was talking to this guy last week, Bitcoiner, and he was apparently talking to Jeremy Rubin, who's author Bibnight 160, friend of mine.
01:18:58.686 - 01:19:01.914, Speaker B: I'm very sad for how hard that process was.
01:19:02.254 - 01:19:37.606, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. So apparently, well, then maybe you would know better than I do, but apparently this guy I talked to, Alex, was talking to Jeremy Rubin, and he said, like, if you could start with a clean slate and build a bitcoin, like, l two in your design, how would you build it? And he said essentially that he would build something, like, in Cairo. And I thought that was interesting. But the reason I asked this is, like, as you know, bitcoin has long been sort of like, we only are going to take the best tech. Like, you know, it's going to. It's going to have to prove itself as the best tech.
01:19:37.606 - 01:20:02.664, Speaker A: And even then, it's hard to get sort of these upgrades in. Like, is, in your mind, is. Is bitcoin ready for some, like, big changes? I don't know how. Well, like, you followed the op cat thing as well. Like, is there tech ready that, like, bitcoin can ship or we're still. I mean, not anytime soon because everything moves very, very slow. But in the near future, are you optimistic about that?
01:20:06.924 - 01:21:02.334, Speaker B: I'm not as optimistic on new op codes as some people, but I do think I'm optimistic on the impact they have. I'm not optimistic on them getting in. That being said, I do feel like even the most maxi lightning people are finally, like, okay, no one's using lightning. And there does seem to be a shift of change. It's just slow into, like, okay, well, yeah, maybe we do need the ZK stuff, right? Like, you see a bunch of lightning devs talk about this now, and they have more political weight in my mind, enough weight to actually push this through. Like, I feel like if, like, blockstream and the lightning people ever agree on anything, then, like, that thing has a chance, and, like, it does feel like starks are the only thing they agree on.
01:21:03.714 - 01:21:26.114, Speaker A: Yeah. And, well, I think that maybe op cat is something that, like, what? I guess Andrew Polstra has been big on it, or I say big on it. I mean, he's been vocal about its potential. What do you think? Have you, like, looked at CTV at all? Do you think it's. I mean, probably to you, this is great. Yeah. Yeah.
01:21:26.114 - 01:21:30.186, Speaker A: But, like, is it. Is it even helpful enough or. Or no?
01:21:30.370 - 01:22:28.214, Speaker B: Well, I think CTV has nice properties of, like, you get to schedule and batch things as you need or want, which is sort of the flexibility that roll ups get with l two s. And, like, I basically think that you're going to end up building something like CTV eventually if you want real l two s. And I think the process when Jeremy did it was political in a certain way. And blockstream just doesn't, I don't know, doesn't like him or something. There was clearly some beef that was part of this. But I also think the fact that these factions now all have so many competing interests, like the blockstream faction versus Luke Dash junior slash Jack Dorsey faction versus the NFT faction versus the, like, ZK faction. Like, there's just enough splitting that it's possible to, I think, to try to sneak things, something over the line.
01:22:29.994 - 01:22:45.714, Speaker A: That'S interesting and like, so tell me what then, like, does what is, like, ideal in your mind? Like, is it op. Snarky? Is this like the. I think there is some, like, opcode that, I mean, I don't know if that's actually.
01:22:46.734 - 01:23:41.244, Speaker B: I think it depends. The reason starks are more likely to work is like, they are hashing based. And so it's just generally easier to implement hashing based things in bitcoin script. The problem with snarks is just like, they use these elliptic curves that are very big and have a lot of space that you need to store. Each point that represents an address is very large in some sense, and the storage needs of that are worse and the locality needs are worse in terms of how operationally things are getting executed. And bitcoin script and bitcoin's stack machine are very limited in those things. So you could add the snark opcode, but you'd basically be adding almost like a precompile.
01:23:41.244 - 01:24:20.252, Speaker B: It's more like an ethereum precompile than it would be. Whereas the stark stuff you could almost implement within the constraints because it's like special type of hashing that's like the 10,000 foot view of the difference. And that's why personally, I think the Starks are more likely to take off and work. I think in Ethereum, snarks can make more sense. But yeah, in general, I'm also just personally, I find starks cleaner, easier to understand. In a lot of ways. Snarks take the math side of it.
01:24:20.252 - 01:24:41.088, Speaker B: You have to take so many detours to get to why they work. I feel like the Starks are much cleaner. So interesting. Those, those are my, yeah, I'm still, I'm generally more positive on starks in the long run, but I I think, like, if. If there was community buy in on adding what's effectively a precompile, then, like, that'd be awesome, but.
01:24:41.216 - 01:25:01.014, Speaker A: And then give us your, like, uh, quick overview of Cat. Like. I mean, Ud and Eric are obviously, like, super gung ho on this. Right? And we got Ryandell, like, working on this. Maybe one of the only people working on this, but encouraging. Is it useful?
01:25:02.394 - 01:25:45.130, Speaker B: I mean, people have talked about it forever, so it's like, yeah, it's just more that I think the political will, again, this boils down to, like, yeah, it's useful. Yeah, there's some security trade offs, but they're very minimal and probably can be patched in a lot of ways. And again, I think the political will is the thing that is most important right now. Like, there's clearly this moment where, yeah, someone had a tweet about this just now, which is like, you know, in 2019 or 2020, it was, like, impossible to imagine bitcoin adding an opcode. But in 2024, the monkeys are running the zoo.
01:25:45.322 - 01:25:47.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I saw that and.
01:25:47.762 - 01:25:58.554, Speaker B: I was like, that's kind of true. Like, there is this moment in time, and so the question is, who is the one who. Who's the person who gets to take advantage of that little political opening and. Yeah, we'll see.
01:25:59.894 - 01:26:04.034, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I think we covered a lot. I really appreciate you coming on.
01:26:05.214 - 01:26:14.234, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks. Definitely. Yeah. Excited to see how. See this go out and see people roast me for.
01:26:17.654 - 01:26:18.622, Speaker A: Thanks. True. And see ya.
01:26:18.678 - 01:26:18.934, Speaker B: See ya.
