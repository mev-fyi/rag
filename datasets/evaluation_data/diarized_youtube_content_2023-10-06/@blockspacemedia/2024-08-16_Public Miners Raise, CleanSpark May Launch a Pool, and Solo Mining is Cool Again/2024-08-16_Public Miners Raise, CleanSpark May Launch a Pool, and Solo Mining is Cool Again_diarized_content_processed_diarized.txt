00:01:04.776 - 00:01:23.968, Speaker A: Dot we are back with the mining pod. Thanks for sticking with us. We're going to kick it off with a difficulty and hash price review. So I'm going to throw this up here. Colin, I'm going to tag you in. What's the latest on hash price? And we just had a difficulty adjustment, didn't we?
00:01:24.064 - 00:01:29.678, Speaker C: Hey man, where's the love for hashrate index here? There's no hash price on this mempool space.
00:01:29.814 - 00:01:35.530, Speaker A: Oh, I'm so sorry. Let me throw up some hash rate index.
00:01:36.150 - 00:02:10.372, Speaker C: I don't want Ethan jumping into my DM's being like, hey, where's the hash price, bro? Love you, Ethan. Big shout out. But yeah. So jokes aside, hash price is back above dollar 40 for PETA hash per day. You know, last week we saw it basically, or I guess that was two weeks ago looking at the seven day. When was that? That it puked? Yeah, August 5 it puked to an all time low, around $35 for petahash per day in response to bitcoin getting crushed. And that was kind of tied up in this whole yen carry trade thing.
00:02:10.372 - 00:02:46.962, Speaker C: I recommend googling that if you don't know what that is. Basically, the bank of Japan raised rates 0.1% and that unwinded a lot of leverage that people had because they were borrowing yen for super cheap and deploying it in other markets trying to get yield. Then they had to sell assets to cover their loans. After that rate was raised even just the slightest percent, it really shows you just how fragile liquidity is when the entire economy is based on funny money. But anyway, besides that, hash price has rebounded since then. Part of that has to do with the fact that bitcoins price has gone back up.
00:02:46.962 - 00:03:26.590, Speaker C: Its at 58k right now, right at 60 the other day. But part of that also has to do with the fact that network difficulty just dropped significantly after hitting an all time high of, I think it was 97 trillion a few weeks ago. Now it's dropped back down to 86.87 trillion after a 4% decrease, which miners are obviously loving to see because before that, there was like a 10.5% increase for the last difficulty adjustment. The bigger story here, if we zoom out, and Charlie, if you could go to hash rate and put it on the three month view for the seven day average, I would be very much in your debt.
00:03:27.010 - 00:03:28.190, Speaker A: There we go.
00:03:29.330 - 00:04:05.142, Speaker C: Hash price hashrate is just whipsawing. Ever since the having weve had these incredible peaks and troughs. It seems like miners just keep. There are a lot of big industrial miners, like the pubcos, that have a bunch of hashrate on order that they're plugging in. Then you also have the rest of the network that has basically marginal cost of production that's teetering on being unprofitable in the current hash price environment. And there's just this constant tug of war between the two. The miners who have the ability to expand and have enough cheap electricity and have the capital to do so, and the miners who are just barely hanging on.
00:04:05.142 - 00:04:49.120, Speaker C: So we're really seeing a kind of tug of war emerge with hashrate right now. And it's kind of anyone's guess as to where it goes for the rest of the year. I think the fact that we're kind of range bound between this, like 600 or really like 500, 5675 exahash per second kind of makes sense to me. A lot of people were saying that we're going to hit a zeta hash by the end of the year, but there's just no way, right? I don't think we're going to see anything like that. So that quick network update, things are seeming not horrible, but not very good for miners. I mean, like, it could be a lot worse, but it also could be a lot better for miners right now. I mean, no miner wants to be earning $43 for PETA hash a day, right? That's.
00:04:49.120 - 00:04:51.504, Speaker C: That's putting a lot of these miners at breakeven.
00:04:51.592 - 00:05:03.740, Speaker A: So which, again, let's just zoom out. Was do we think I'm going to open it up to both of you guys. Do you think that was the hash rate bottom after the having? What do you think, Matt?
00:05:04.050 - 00:05:38.050, Speaker D: Oh, that's tough. I think it actually, yeah, maybe the bottom just because how much financing has been available to miners? I mean, we're going to get to it later in the show, but there's a lot of new raises now. The purpose behind those raises may not necessarily be expanding hash rate. A bit of foreshadowing there, but, yeah, I mean, I think if you're bullish on the market and still think that there is upward movement to go in the cycle and you think miners are going to continue to expand.
00:05:40.150 - 00:05:40.510, Speaker C: Then.
00:05:40.550 - 00:05:46.246, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that kind of signals possibly a hashrate bottom.
00:05:46.398 - 00:06:20.126, Speaker C: It would make sense to me. The bottom right now after the halving is 556 exa hashes a day. I think for us to go below that, you would need to see some real carnage. I mean, like some real carnage with bitcoins price and hash price. So, you know, I would, you know, never say never, but I find it hard to see a bitcoin or hash price going below that. 550 extra hashes a day, but anything could happen. But like Matt said, there's just so much financing floating around.
00:06:20.126 - 00:06:48.150, Speaker C: There's a lot of liquidity within the public miners with the public miners that are deploying new machines. And there's also, like, outside of the us context, there are miners all over the world in cheaper cost areas that are deploying. Right. I think we often get caught up in the US ever since China's mining ban, because that is kind of the gravitational center of the industry right now. But there's still plenty of activity going on all around the world, and I don't really see us necessarily dipping back down to that level.
00:06:50.450 - 00:07:20.870, Speaker E: In the competitive world of bitcoin mining, one name stands out. Cleanspark, America's bitcoin miner. At Cleanspark, efficiency isn't just a goal, it's our standard. Our sophisticated facilities are built and led by expert teams who care about bitcoin and the communities. We work in scale. We've mastered it. Our large scale operations have set us apart in the industry as examples of community oriented building.
00:07:20.870 - 00:07:40.036, Speaker E: Our track record speaks for itself. We navigate the complexities of the new economy with precision and with skill, continuously achieving operational milestones curious about how we do it? We invite you to discover the story behind Cleanspark success@cleanspark.com.
00:07:40.068 - 00:08:05.832, Speaker A: Dot so both of you guys referenced, we think it's probably the bottom just because of the amount of capital flowing in and financing and debt. That's our next story from the miner mag. Bitcoin miners raised 2.1 billion since Q two via stocks. I'm going to toss this to you, Matt. Can you summarize what's happening here? And then we can go kind of piece wise by the notable stories.
00:08:06.016 - 00:09:16.880, Speaker D: It's a lot of debt financing by public listed miners. And it's kind of like if you followed the sailor saga over time, how he's kind of always going through these convertible notes. It's a similar sort of thing. And the way that I would think about this broadly is you can finance yourself through different kinds of investors. And so instead of going through the equity side of things, this is more going through the debt side of things. And so if you see that there's an appetite over there and you're maybe cautious about your shareholders and potential dilution, if you think that might be a sensitive topic and you think that there's appetite in the debt market, maybe there's mandates among hedge funds where they need to play in the debt market, not go buy bitcoin ETF's, but maybe they want, or the mining stock itself, don't want that exposure, but actually need per their mandate, per their board to acquire debt assets. This is kind of an outlet for them.
00:09:16.880 - 00:09:59.950, Speaker D: And so if you see that potential appetite there, you want financing. I think this is possibly how you could tap into that. And so we've seen several miners lately go that route. Now, if you're an investor in mining stocks and one of the companies has done that, you should definitely see what the purpose is. Are they buying asics? Are they expanding their infrastructure to support AI? Are they buying bitcoin? What are they doing with that money, I think is always something that's prudent as an investor. And you're evaluating companies.
00:10:00.490 - 00:10:13.900, Speaker A: Okay, so there's money flying around going into mining. Let's take a look at how some of this money and debt instruments are being deployed. I'm going to toss it to you, Colin, to just get high level. Bitdeer burst out the gate.
00:10:13.980 - 00:10:56.852, Speaker C: Yeah. So per this article from our friends at the miner mag, shout out to Wolfiesau and Shant Sharma, Bitdeer raised 150 million in convertible notes or to issue 150 million in convertible notes. But Deere also raised 150,000,100. 6 million via stock offerings in Q one and Q two, respectively. It just plays into the narrative that we've seen really over the past year, since bitcoin has been in an uptrend, all of these public miners have just been diluting and selling their stocks through various instruments like at the market offerings or other stock offerings to really lubricate their balance sheets. It makes sense and especially made sense last year. They're preparing for the halving.
00:10:56.852 - 00:11:20.120, Speaker C: It makes even more sense now as miners see where they're at after the halving and see what they need to do to remain viable over the next four years. With regards to how Bitdir is going to use this money, that's what I would be very curious to see. Bitdeer has a huge fleet of proprietary hash rate. A lot of that though. Actually, no, sorry. It has a lot of hash rate under management. A lot of that's hosting clients.
00:11:20.120 - 00:11:49.418, Speaker C: About five exahashes is self mining and like one exahash is for cloud mining, which I anticipate to go to zero over this, over this having epoch, I don't see how cloud mining is going to be viable at all. It was barely viable last epoch. I don't see how it will be viable. This one. They've toyed with the idea of breaking into AI like any miner. They've kind of just made announcements about it. I haven't seen anything substantive in their ten qs to show or they're, I guess they're a six k because they're a foreign issuer.
00:11:49.418 - 00:12:44.692, Speaker C: But I haven't seen anything substantial for what they're going to be doing with that. I would have to imagine that a decent amount of this will go into R and D for their seal miner, which that's kind of been the biggest thing I think to come out of bitdeer over the last year is this news that they're going to start trying to break into the ASIC minor manufacturing game and create a competitive rig that can maybe hold its own with the micro, the what's, miners and the antminers of the world. And for those who don't know, bit Deer's one of Bitdeer's founders. Jihan Wu actually was one of the co founders at Bitmain before he was ousted. So if there's any company that could potentially pull it off, it would be bitdeer really kind of excited to see what happens with the seal miner in that regard. And yeah, I guess we can kind of hop on over to.
00:12:44.796 - 00:12:55.220, Speaker A: Let's go to the next one, is it? Yeah, let's do marathon first. What year is this? Marathon's buying bitcoin with convertible notes. I'll toss it back to you, Colin and Matt.
00:12:56.320 - 00:13:52.290, Speaker C: Yeah, and quick, just quick clarifying point here. The Minermag article is a little bit messy in the sense that it's looking at Q two numbers for equity financing, and it's also looking at current actions taken by these companies for convertible notes. So the vast majority of the financing that we saw in Q two, like 90%, was miners selling equity through stock offerings, through ATM's, at the market offerings, and things like that. Easiest way for miners to get liquidity, especially if their stocks hot. They're going to sell it like hotcakes. But we've also seen so far in Q three the convertible notes come out. And these are basically hybrid debt equity instruments, where a company is loaned money and the claim on that loan can then be converted to debt or can be converted to equity later on as a form of payoff.
00:13:52.290 - 00:14:42.954, Speaker C: All of the terms are always different. Every convertible note is not like each convertible note is different from another convertible note. So the kind of details and specifics about when the stock will or when the debt will convert to equity and things like that are for you all to dig into the ten qs. But regardless, to Charlie's point, Marathon has issued a $250 million convertible note to buy bitcoin. Not even mine bitcoin or expand their operations, but to buy it. This really does reek of some 2021 2022 balance sheet games, especially when the market was a little less mature. And the two things that the markets would react to were miners buying Asics and miners buying bitcoin.
00:14:42.954 - 00:15:15.868, Speaker C: And for anyone who remembers that really didnt work out very well. A lot of miners bought hoards of bitcoin at like the tail end of the bull market in 2022, only to sell them for fractions of what they bought them for. Or sorry, they bought the bitcoin in 2021 at the tail end of the bull market and they sold them at 2022 near the bottom or for half of what they paid for it. I hope that's not a top signal, but it doesn't exactly inspire confidence for me as someone who's a commentator and a bitcoin miner himself.
00:15:16.004 - 00:15:19.492, Speaker A: Matt hot takes well, I would just say broad stroke.
00:15:19.516 - 00:16:29.850, Speaker D: What we're seeing is hash price has been down for a while really since the having as we open the show with so margins are tight and so the miners that can are tapping into the financing options that they have. But what's interesting is they're doing it for different reasons. Marathon taking a page out of the sailor book, buying a bunch of bitcoin, trying to attract investors that way, maybe get some premium on their holdings and show why they deserve that premium. They typically had a Hodl strategy in the past, bitdeer raising to try to expand and attract more Asics core, scientific. Here they are trying to restructure their debt, right, and get lower interest rate options kind of for the future and lower their expenses that way. And so we basically are seeing a bunch of different public listed mining companies in a relatively difficult environment, right. As we're kind of sitting here and taking on different strategies.
00:16:29.850 - 00:17:00.980, Speaker D: And I think that is a story that we're going to continue to see, particularly as there's like many different bifurcations in the space too, right? There's the AI play and there's the absolutely not. And in real time, I think we're watching this play out and I think everyone is kind of hoping for bitcoin price boom and everyone's kind of unsure of whether we're actually going to get it. Charlie, what do you think?
00:17:01.320 - 00:17:23.201, Speaker A: I repeat what you guys say. You guys are the ones who look much more closely at public miners than me. Well, speaking of public miners and pure play miners, we're going to skip over to the next topic if you're still with us. Thank you. This is an interesting story. We broke it on the mining pod that cleanspark wants to enter the pool business. Colin, you had a great thread on this.
00:17:23.201 - 00:17:27.569, Speaker A: Can you explain what's happening and talk me through your thread here?
00:17:27.689 - 00:17:57.644, Speaker C: Yeah. So Cleanspark wants to do something that absolutely no one should do, which is start a mining pool, which is not even totally fair. Right. Because if they do this thing the way that Mera does it, they won't be a pool, they'll just be self mining, which is, you know, makes sense for a miner of their size. Cleanspark has, what is it, 20? Yeah, 20.4 exahashes as of the end of Q two. So they can reliably do self mining and probably make some good money doing it.
00:17:57.644 - 00:18:46.896, Speaker C: Whether or not they'll make more doing that than doing fpps with foundry is another question entirely. But yeah, this one kind of struck me as a surprise because Zach Bradford, the CEO of Queenspark, told will flat out when he asked, are you going to build a mining pool? He said, eventually we will do it. And he says that their motivations are somewhat altruistic, or as I say in the article, it's existential because bitcoin is going to need this clean spark is going to get really big, and it's going to be important for the network that they have a pool. It's a little bit self aggrandizing. And I am curious if that is the full story. I think that a public miner self mining their own blocks gives them a lot more control, especially as bitcoin mining and bitcoin in general falls under increased scrutiny from regulators and officials. Right.
00:18:46.896 - 00:20:02.106, Speaker C: This is something that we've seen play out. Slowly, the creeping arm of the administrative and regulatory state continues to reach into the realm of bitcoin. We've seen things like bills proposed to make node operators and miners essentially the same as money, money service businesses, money transmitters. We've seen a lot of taxation proposed from the democratic legislatures and from Biden's White House about how we need to tax bitcoin miners more. So I can't help but wonder if the story underneath here is a need to have more control over their block templates and their transaction selection, which I asked Zach about in a follow up, and he said that in no way is this anything like an attempt to censor transactions like marathon did. Very briefly, for those of you who don't remember, Maripool launched a few years ago. And one of the first things that they did in May of 2022 is they started censoring OFAC sanctioned addresses, or addresses that were associated with OFAC.
00:20:02.106 - 00:20:54.652, Speaker C: And OFAC is the Foreign Office of America's basically Asset Control office, where they basically look at financial institutions and financial actors around the world, and they make judgments based on whether or not those institutions can do business with american businesses. So if you're on an OFAC sanctions list, you can't do any business with anyone in the United States. And marathon was basically almost preempting certain regulatory action, thinking that, okay, we need to get ahead of the game here. If a bitcoin address is associated with OFAC sanctions, we need to just not touch it at all. Of course, they stopped this after less than a month because their transaction fee revenue was tanking and they were making less money per block, and their shareholders were like, why are you doing this? Because there's no reason for them to do this. There's no regulations. So for me, it's an interesting news tidbit because it's very topical.
00:20:54.652 - 00:21:52.446, Speaker C: Given that, and also what Charlie has right here on the thread, the whole idea of pool centralization, which has been blown into the open over the last six months, I would say from some great research, like guys like Zero, XB and also mononaut. And for those of you who don't know what this is, what the tweet there is showing over the last half year, the whole concept of proxy pooling or proxy mining has come into the public discourse and what this basically means is your mining pool may be selling its hash rate, which is your hashrate, and everyone elses hashrate to another pool. And this is basically the same thing going on on a massive scale as miners going to full pay per share pools in the first place. Charlie runs a pool. Im a miner. I dont want to stomach variants. I sell my hashrate to Charlie for a fixed amount that we agree upon and I always get payment no matter whether Charlie wins a block or nothing.
00:21:52.446 - 00:22:33.286, Speaker C: Well, what happens with this is fpps pools end up having very thin margins already, but then theyre taking on all the luck risks. So if they have a bad luck streak they could go bankrupt, they could become insolvent. Theyre always toeing the line between having enough liquidity or not. And so what they end up doing to mitigate this is they end up selling their hashrate to other pools to mitigate that volatility on their side. Which is ironic considering that miners go to fpps pools because they want to mitigate volatility. So fpps pools then go to other fvps pools to mitigate the same volatility that their miners come to them for. So I think the kind of takeaway here is it's good to have more players in the arena.
00:22:33.286 - 00:22:43.502, Speaker C: That being said, if Cleanspark does bootstrap its own self mining operation, it probably won't be a pool. So whether or not this actually helps in the long run is kind of TBD.
00:22:43.686 - 00:22:44.830, Speaker A: Thoughts Matt?
00:22:44.990 - 00:23:14.254, Speaker D: Colin really covered it. I'll just say I'm similarly skeptical or selling the reason why theyre doing this. I dont necessarily think its because for the good of bitcoin, but im buying the idea that it may be because they want a bit more control of transaction inclusion and maybe want to benefit on that moving forward. I think we saw that Maripool won a bit from fee revenue wise from their accelerator.
00:23:14.422 - 00:23:16.686, Speaker A: Over a million dollars in revenue to date.
00:23:16.758 - 00:23:37.238, Speaker D: Additional boom Charlie coming in with the actual numbers. But yeah, so they want a bit in that realm and maybe cleanspark doesn't do that right away. We don't know exactly what this is going to look like, but maybe their vision is down the line. They somehow, some way could benefit on the fee side. And that's what I'm looking for.
00:23:37.374 - 00:23:48.706, Speaker C: The rise of private mempools. Everyone's going to be sending their transactions to a public miner one day. Your transaction will be censored and you will be happy. Sorry, it's the last thing I want to say about it.
00:23:48.858 - 00:24:16.470, Speaker A: Speaking of, let's just go even more cypherpunk. Let's look at this other pool. This is solo ck pool, which, if you're not familiar, it's a solo mining pool. So if you have one Asic and you want to, we might call it lottery mine. You can point it to here and win the whole block. It's a pool where, if your actual rig hits the nonce, you get the block and the full reward. We've seen this hits two pleb mining angles here.
00:24:16.470 - 00:24:31.470, Speaker A: We've seen the rise of the bit axe miner and increased hashrate on Soloci cable over the past several months. Colin and or Matt, which of you wants to talk about this and then talk about the bit axe?
00:24:32.130 - 00:25:15.194, Speaker D: Okay, I'm not going to get into the technical weeds, but what I will say is that this is what I would call the equivalent of meme coin bidding in the bitcoin mining space. Because basically, you're shooting for the lottery. You're plugging in a machine that in virtually all respects is uncompetitive compared to actual miners out there. But the way that winning blocks actually works is you're looking in a number space. You're looking in this finite field of numbers, and you're hoping to get the winning ticket. And so you just might win and find that number. You just might find what will give you a valid bitcoin block.
00:25:15.194 - 00:25:48.380, Speaker D: And if you do, it's a major payday. It's a huge payday. And so the cost of what it takes to actually run one of these low budget, uncompetitive machines is something really low. And something people might just equate to what it is to buy a lotto ticket at a gas station, you know, in their monthly budget. And so I think that's what we're seeing. We did actually see someone running a bit x miner, which is, you know, one of these machines win a block a week or two ago, and it's, you know, a major, major payout. A whole block.
00:25:48.380 - 00:25:54.160, Speaker D: Do you guys know the dollar number at the time when they actually won this block?
00:25:54.280 - 00:26:05.320, Speaker A: Gosh, I don't know. It's 3.2 bitcoin, basically. So that times say sixty k. I mean, that's a house. That's a low priced house in a Midwest city.
00:26:05.740 - 00:26:22.188, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, that's a fat payday. So that was July 24. It looks like bitcoin was at 65k. So that's a pretty substantial. That's a pretty substantial payday. I mean, that's basically 200 grand.
00:26:22.188 - 00:26:50.250, Speaker C: Right. And you know what's wild is that since the having, what is that? Nine or 82468? Yeah. Ck pool has mined nine blocks, which is pretty incredible if you actually think about it. And all time they have garnered 5487 BTC mining rewards because it's actually been active since like 2014.
00:26:50.670 - 00:27:10.760, Speaker D: Yeah, goofy saying but it actually is one in a million. Actually, worse than that. It is Degen mining is what it is. But I guess it worked out nine times. Best of luck to you bitax miners out there. We're rooting for you.
00:27:10.880 - 00:27:32.518, Speaker C: Yeah, we really are. Keep doing it, guys. It's cool to see this stuff still happening. It makes me wonder what the I feel like ocean pool launching last year kind of sparked this renewed interest in pools in general. And then you had like Alessandro de la Tour, formerly of pool or f.
00:27:32.534 - 00:27:33.250, Speaker D: Two pool.
00:27:34.950 - 00:28:01.812, Speaker C: Launching demand pool which is based on straight mv two. Obviously Ocean is building their own version of block timber construction because for straight mv two, you don't actually build your own templates. So if you're running straight in v two, you don't actually have the ability to transaction select. You just make suggestions to the pool and say maybe you should add these. Like I see your template has these transactions. I would like to remove these and put these in. You can make requests but you can't actually take control of the block template construction.
00:28:01.812 - 00:28:31.574, Speaker C: But ocean pool is going to if they don't already have that enabled already. I think that's coming soon. And then you've had a bunch of other people, I feel like, chatter about starting pools. I've seen some plebs talk about it. Steve Barber at one point joked about starting a pool called mother pool, which is cool to see. I do think that I don't want to like concern troll, but the proxy pooling thing is not good. We don't want ant pool specifically, which is the pool that ends up garnering most of the hashrate from this.
00:28:31.574 - 00:29:17.410, Speaker C: We don't want them to have nearly 50% of the hash rate on any given day and I would like to see more competition accordingly. But like I said, I dont want to concern troll because people say is this bad for bitcoin? Its like theoretically, yeah, its kind of like this. I write in the article its kind of like a sword of damocles but its fine until it drops and I dont really fully know how its going to drop because I do think that theres no reason for amp pool to do anything like a 51% attack because then they just nuke their revenue source. But if this were to happen in the US, I worry about censorship. I think that would be a huge problem. If you had 50% of the hash rate being proxied in the US via mega miners and public miners, you basically could just have the US government or any regulator being like nice choke point you have there, you have to do this now.
00:29:18.470 - 00:29:38.658, Speaker A: Interesting choice of words. Choke point. Thank you both. If you are listening to this and you want to hear more in depth research on this specific topic of pools, go hit the block. Space Media newsletter, the most recent mining pod newsletter, specifically. Otherwise, thank you so much for listening to the mining pod weekly roundup. We do this every week.
00:29:38.658 - 00:29:48.730, Speaker A: It comes out on Fridays on Coindesk. And make sure to check out the great sponsors of the mining pod. Thank you very much and see you next week.
