00:02:50.390 - 00:03:37.060, Speaker C: It'S morning again in bitcoin. Today, mortegens and traders will go to work than ever before in our industry's history. With interest rates five times higher than last cycle, thousands of bitcoiners hope to turn this year's yield into a down payment. This afternoon, 6500 young men and women will be married. And with inflation at less than half of what it was just two years ago, they can look forward with confidence to the future. It's morning again in bitcoin, and under the leadership of Michael Saylor, our industry is prouder and stronger and better. Why would we ever want to return to where we were less than three short years ago?
00:03:39.990 - 00:03:51.606, Speaker A: Hey, welcome back to the mining pod. We got a news roundup for you this week. Plenty going on in bitcoin and bitcoin mining circles. Got Charlie and Matt both. Welcome to the show. Charlie, Matt, how you guys doing?
00:03:51.788 - 00:03:59.094, Speaker D: Fantastic. Great as always. I'm actually officially now a part of blockspace media with Will Foxley. So happy to be here.
00:03:59.212 - 00:04:03.610, Speaker A: Yes. We should have done like an announcement episode. I should have interviewed you on the podcast.
00:04:04.590 - 00:04:06.810, Speaker D: This is the quiet sleeper announcement.
00:04:07.470 - 00:04:18.874, Speaker A: Yeah, we're just kind of rolling into it, but yeah, we're thankful to have Charlie join the show. Well, not the show, the team. Full time. It's been on the show since December, January.
00:04:19.002 - 00:04:22.974, Speaker D: It's been a long time. Yeah, I go back a couple of years, actually, I think.
00:04:23.012 - 00:04:38.434, Speaker A: Well, you've been on the show previously, but as a full time co host. Yeah, one day we'll get Matt as well. Okay. We'll jump right into it. For today. We're talking about mempool updates, as always. Difficulties going up or it's actually going down this period.
00:04:38.434 - 00:04:41.654, Speaker A: Right? Like a little bit? Should we just jump right into that?
00:04:41.692 - 00:04:46.034, Speaker E: Not even do like an overview to go down slightly.
00:04:46.162 - 00:04:46.598, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:46.684 - 00:04:47.330, Speaker D: Okay.
00:04:47.500 - 00:04:49.878, Speaker A: We put in the notes.
00:04:50.054 - 00:04:51.738, Speaker E: Still a lot of blocks left.
00:04:51.904 - 00:04:52.620, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:58.510 - 00:05:15.682, Speaker D: If you've checked in on the current retarget difficulty, retarget, like halfway through it's not uncommon for it to change a few percent. So 2% within my standard deviation of who knows which way it'll go in seven days.
00:05:15.816 - 00:05:50.378, Speaker A: Okay, we'll get back to difficulty in a second. I'm completely butchering this intro today, but that's okay. Thursday morning, so some grace for me. We're going to go over and talk about the ATM shelf offerings that Bitdeer and Iris energy put out this week. And then also marathon digital going and purchasing applied digital site. So a lot of public moves. And then we'll go over to ordinals land, get an update from Charlie on the Runes airdrop and finish up with a cool report about via BTC and how they weren't signing their blocks correctly or something like that.
00:05:50.378 - 00:06:25.560, Speaker A: A little bit more of a technical conversation, but they missed out a lot of money for bitcoin mining, so we definitely need to cover that. Let's go back to difficulty and kick it off. Looking like we're going to go down 2%. I guess maybe the last few months we've just had a lot of growth and we just overshot last difficulty going up. What's your guys'read? On this? To my knowledge, rack space still has a premium. People are still putting machines online. There was even a great piece out, minor mag this week talking about how s other units are coming online from private miners who are ramping up going into happening.
00:06:26.490 - 00:07:05.210, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I saw a report this week talking about, let's see the type of rigs being delivered, Q one and Q two. And just bitmain talk about the preorders. And the S 21 is like over a quarter of all preorders and deliveries they're having. So I know that people are getting their 20 ones and plugging them in. So maybe that two difficulty adjustments ago in the middle of February was probably one of those big sites coming online and I would expect hash rate to go up right up until the having and then we can see where we're at as far as profitability.
00:07:05.390 - 00:07:52.770, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess. Also hash rate tends to lag price sometimes. We had a correction here in the last couple of days and although it doesn't perhaps feel that crazy because of how much price has increased lately, it was still from about 73K down to about 62K. So ten plus percent correction and then you just have an expectation of minus around 2% to Charlie's point in hash rate. And we're not done with the period. We're about halfway really done. I mean, the further we move along this difficulty period, the harder it will be to actually move that change likelihood.
00:07:52.770 - 00:07:58.902, Speaker E: But I wouldn't be surprised if this moves a little closer to zero the coming days.
00:07:59.036 - 00:08:30.670, Speaker A: Of course, the reason this matters is because we're targeting our having date for 420, April 20. So if it goes too fast, then we'll probably undershoot that and go to April 19. And so we kind of want to stay in this target. So I'm in favor of decreasing difficulty adjustments until we hit the 20th perfectly. Especially since we're throwing the Denver bit devs happening party on the 20th. And if it's on the 19th, it's really going to take like the wind out of our sale. So if you're listening to this and you have a big site, please unplug for the next few weeks.
00:08:30.820 - 00:08:32.254, Speaker E: You're hashing too hard.
00:08:32.372 - 00:08:36.126, Speaker A: You're hashing way too hard. You're going to ruin my party here in Denver.
00:08:36.238 - 00:08:44.020, Speaker D: My sister gets married on the 20th, so I'm going to bet against Will. So plug in all your rigs and turn them up. Overclock them, please.
00:08:45.030 - 00:09:06.662, Speaker A: Not cool. Okay, we got the difficulty adjustment out of the way bitcoin price. We've talked about it a lot in the show at the beginning, so we won't do that this week. It's probably around 68 right now. I haven't checked in a bit. Let's go and talk about public mining companies. In Q four, we saw huge ATMs hit the shelf.
00:09:06.662 - 00:09:38.454, Speaker A: We think marathon put out a $750,000,000.01 cleanspark, did a 500 million dollar one pretty recently. Now we have Iris energy and Bitdeer doing them. So Iris Energy, according to minor mag, raised 213,000,000 in Q one ATM offering. I think from like Q Four to the beginning of Q One, there's like $1.5 billion in these offerings and it seems like they're filling up pretty easily. So the other one is bitdeer, which I think was on the minor mag earlier in the week, and it was about $750,000,000.
00:09:38.454 - 00:10:13.214, Speaker A: And that came after their chip announcement for their. I think it's like Seal one ASIC chip and they're going to start preorders for their ASIC as well. So what does this mean? Think we're in a bull market? ASIC prices haven't gone up that much quite yet. These public companies are just gearing up, getting cash in the door so they can deploy more hash rate. All the ones that are huge, like large offerings. I think our teams are doing pretty well. So that's what you're seeing with that.
00:10:13.214 - 00:10:35.382, Speaker A: There are a few other companies I mentioned in here that are still doing pretty well, even though they're smaller in terms of hash rate under management. So I think they mentioned bit digital at the end, raised 33.5 million. I think bit digital has somewhere around three x a hash. So it definitely seems to be like your ATM offering. It can be as large as your hash rate is on the market. That is what I have seen.
00:10:35.382 - 00:10:36.722, Speaker A: Matt. Charlie.
00:10:36.866 - 00:11:17.640, Speaker E: Yeah, look, that's expensive. It's been expensive and the public mining companies have been, I think rightfully so, tapping public markets to try to get capital. I think this is just another instance of that. And yeah, maybe they're gearing up to get further into what has been the mining gold rush. It feels like we are in the mining gold rush part of the mining cycle and each having cycle in the past has sort of kicked that off and continued it. I think miners are preparing for that. We see S 21 shipments all over the place.
00:11:17.640 - 00:11:22.854, Speaker E: This makes sense to me. Charlie, what do you think?
00:11:23.052 - 00:12:19.046, Speaker D: Yeah, it's really interesting because if we look at the story of the ASICS paid for with very expensive debt from last cycle, it was a very expensive and painful lesson that a lot of people just barely emerged from. And it's interesting because it's kind of obvious you want to take out debt when the price is low and the value of your collateral and the machines goes up. So machines are near still their all time low. So the value of your collateral and what you're taking that out against is it seems like a better time than the last cycle, back when rigs were at twelve and $14,000. I would hope the industry has gotten more sophisticated at structuring these deals. And so, yeah, I think the public markets and debt markets are a huge tool. You just got to not be too dejent about it.
00:12:19.046 - 00:12:31.994, Speaker D: So I think the industry has probably matured a bit and it's a bull market. So the hundreds of millions of dollars raised towards this is like not surprising to me. I think we'll see even bigger deals over the next few months too.
00:12:32.192 - 00:12:36.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Didn't marathon put out like a $1 billion shelf recently? Is that true?
00:12:37.092 - 00:12:40.174, Speaker D: Thought I saw that seven or 800. I think it was a lot.
00:12:40.292 - 00:13:03.718, Speaker A: It was a lot of money. Yeah. One thought on this that's surprising to me that markets don't price these things in very easily. So Matt's point, debt is expensive, 5% interest rates probably higher. If you're going through a different credit facility, bitcoin, why would you want to sell your bitcoin right now? Corn is going up. So if you sell that asset to get more hash rate, probably not worth it. Especially going into happening.
00:13:03.718 - 00:13:28.158, Speaker A: Rather just sit on that. So you go to the market and you do these offerings. It's surprising me like these aren't priced a little bit differently right now. ASIC prices are still low. So I see why miners are trying to pick up more ASICs right now by using an ATM. They're going to refurbish their fleets, get up S 19s or get XPs out of the way and put in S 20 ones or T 20 ones. And that's basically what's happening here.
00:13:28.158 - 00:14:06.538, Speaker A: Unless they're going out and buying rack space. The fact that the market doesn't realize that. And there's like this six month period where these stocks or these public companies can go to the market and sell equity so easily in the refurbish. And then I think like six months from now you're going to see a little bit of a different situation where the unit cost to buy an ASIC goes up so much it doesn't necessarily make sense to go and sell equity. You just kind of want to sit during that period and wait and just keep mining bitcoin. But we're like right before that period starts. So that's kind of a wild thing for me to take a look at here and see that going on.
00:14:06.538 - 00:14:14.526, Speaker A: But we can move on to the next story. I think we're getting an ordinals update from Charlie which is becoming sort of like a feature every week on the.
00:14:14.548 - 00:14:15.374, Speaker D: Show, which is great.
00:14:15.412 - 00:14:23.026, Speaker A: I think we're the only real show that does an ordinals update weekly. Probably the only show in Coindesk that does an ordinals update weekly. Yeah.
00:14:23.048 - 00:15:19.598, Speaker D: I'm surprised that this isn't standard in pretty much anybody who's doing any kind of bitcoin mining analysis because this is becoming a material driving factor of unit economics. So in the blockspace newsletter, the most recent tale is in Ordinal's adjacent topic, which is runes, the new fungible token standard thrown out by Casey. And right now everybody and their dog is issuing basically pre runes. They're basically creating an inscription or an ordinal which they'll give to you which you can then redeem supposedly at a later date when the runes standard launches. That's on the having. So this is in anticipation of driving a lot of fee revenue to miners post having. But right now the market for these IOUs basically to future runes claims is significant.
00:15:19.598 - 00:16:06.530, Speaker D: And here's a chart from last if you're watching online on YouTube, here's a chart in a newsletter from this past week. Just kind of snapshot of the overall market capitalization of these inscriptions, which are IOUs. And we saw this tick over half a billion dollars over the past week and it's fluctuated a lot. This has been kind of a comparatively robust market so far and it seems like it's only increasing in interest. So even since this newsletter on Monday, the market has changed a lot and there's even more of these things. They're airdropped to users. So it's a very lucrative time to be speculating on bitcoin.
00:16:06.530 - 00:16:27.238, Speaker D: And I would love for this to kind of spill over into a lucrative cherry on top of the cake for miners post having. So you'll be hearing a lot of runes updates on this show. Runes and ordinals, different things, but they go together right now and the market treats them as such. So been fun watching it.
00:16:27.324 - 00:16:46.858, Speaker A: And a little plug for bitcoin season two. That's show Charlie's booting up right now. We've done two episodes to date doing live streams. So if you follow the blockspace pod Twitter account at blockspace pod, which you can find in the show notes, then you can find conversations about all this stuff. So you're into runes, ordinals. Want to scratch that itch?
00:16:46.954 - 00:16:47.726, Speaker D: Go there.
00:16:47.828 - 00:17:09.198, Speaker A: Need ASIC help? Check out Vitamine, one of Bitmain's certified repair shops located in Washington state with satellite offices in Colorado, Oklahoma and Texas. PSUS hashboards, immersion setups, in and out of warranty repair. Vitamine has you covered. Want to train your technicians? Bring vitamine to your site for hands on training in the art of ASIC repair, complete with Bitmain AMTC certification.
00:17:09.374 - 00:17:13.586, Speaker B: Contact Vitamin today at dan@vmasic.com again, that's.
00:17:13.618 - 00:17:32.098, Speaker A: Dan@Vmasic.Com when you think of ASIC repair, think vidamine. So Charlie, just for one point of clarification for runestones, we have Casey's whole project and then there's a lot of people around it sort of taking the same name and launching their own risk.
00:17:32.294 - 00:18:21.094, Speaker D: It is so difficult to differentiate what is the standard or the protocol and then what are the particular projects. So the colloquial nomenclature for this token standard is the runes token standard. Casey's particular GitHub repo he calls runestone. That means his specific implementation of the runes standard. So when people say runes, they always mean Casey's runestone. Then there is the most popular and largest by market cap pre runes NFT inscription, which is also called rune stones. And that is issued and kind of led by a leonidas, a well known ordinals influencer.
00:18:21.094 - 00:18:53.238, Speaker D: But there is a bunch of these, and I'm curious to see how the market kind of shakes out as far as nomenclature, because I found that the market and the Dejins can only introduce one or two new words each narrative cycle. So I would love for the market to sufficiently differentiate between the standard and the projects on the standard. This would be really good for us to do. Otherwise it's going to get really hard to cover these things.
00:18:53.404 - 00:19:20.446, Speaker E: I'm glad that the ordinals community has accepted the bitcoin ecosystem's naming conventions. That's very comforting that we're just following this train. We're just going to keep it rolling and no one's going to know it. Anything's going on. Charlie, I do have a question for you. There's all these IOUs, right? These are all ious. The official rune block when everything is live is the having.
00:19:20.446 - 00:20:03.422, Speaker E: We're still about a month away from that at the time of recording. Does this mean that there's going to be. I think this is the equivalent language in altcoin speak, token generation events following the having block that brings, I mean, really high transaction demand. Is there strong reason for the issuers of these rune fungible tokens to do their issuance in immediacy after the block, or are they expected to? How will this affect the fee market?
00:20:03.556 - 00:20:57.150, Speaker D: We will have to see. But the short answer is yes, there's an urgency and a huge market demand to be early and first. The way that runes get their name is probably won't dive into it, but a lot of people will just have the ability to name their rune whatever they want. But there's obviously going to be market leaders. And when kind of like we say, well, colloquially, we refer to the RSIC runes token, everybody will know that we're talking about that specific one. It's going to be a clear mad dash through the door in the blocks following the having. And it could result in a similar mechanic as we saw with BRC 20, where you have people bidding against each other and it result in an incremental, perhaps cyclical fee spike and fee demand.
00:20:57.150 - 00:20:59.454, Speaker D: Very exciting times.
00:20:59.572 - 00:21:02.918, Speaker E: Can I say something? Can I make a public service announcement?
00:21:03.034 - 00:21:03.842, Speaker D: Do it.
00:21:03.976 - 00:21:50.298, Speaker E: Ladies and gentlemen of the mining pod, consolidate your utxos. Do it now. Do it right now. Because now that people can speculate within block space on financial assets. Right? And I say that term loosely. But now that people can speculate on assets within bitcoin block space, and it's not just used for simple transactions, we could have a fee environment like bitcoin has never seen before, and that impacts you as a bitcoin owner, and you do not want your utxos to fall below the dust limit.
00:21:50.394 - 00:21:58.370, Speaker A: Oh, we should have brought the John Caravallo. I think that's how you say his last name. Video up about him talking about lightning. Maybe we'll do that next week.
00:21:58.440 - 00:22:35.366, Speaker D: We'll do that next. Actually, here's an actionable item based upon what Matt said for the miners who might be listening to this. And that is a lot of miners I know, particularly the smaller ones, may have regular withdrawals from a pool to their cold or hot wallet. And that means you probably have a bunch of Utxos pointing to your wallet, if you don't know what I mean, and you get regular withdrawals to your wallet, you need to figure out what we're talking about and you need to learn how to consolidate your utxos. So this is an actionable item for listeners of the mining pod.
00:22:35.478 - 00:22:54.654, Speaker A: No, it's real. I went to go do something, I forget what I was doing, but I had a bunch of Utxos. I think it was in a mining wallet, honestly. And I was looking at the fee and I was like, wow, this is just going to blow me out of the water because it was like reconsolidating everything. So I just didn't do anything. So I was like, okay, I'll just leave it. So I should probably go figure that out right after the show.
00:22:54.654 - 00:23:47.762, Speaker A: But no idea which wallet that. Oh well, I will state one last thing for this on the happening. There's going to be some craziness, I think, around this block with the runestones. And if you are interested in learning more about that, go check out the podcast we did with Brandon Bailey last week or earlier this week, formerly of Galaxy Digital, and we go over why that could be somewhat contentious or crazy. If you're into mining pools and that sort of dynamic, that's going to be the thing to watch and to speculate on. I want to try to convince Matt of something that I was talking with Charlie last night about, which I think maybe you already brought up, because you bring up, oh, no, you brought bruinstones on screen. I wonder what the next narrative or Fud wave is for ordinals.
00:23:47.762 - 00:24:28.802, Speaker A: And the one I want to start is that ordinals create paper bitcoin. So bear with me for a second, so if you have a bunch of node monkeys or a bunch of nfts, bitcoin, NFTs that are worth like five bitcoin, ten bitcoin floor in the future, then if you take the aggregate amount of those bitcoin within the bids for them versus all the hoddle bitcoin out there, you could convince someone that there's not enough bitcoin out there to bid against all these NFTs. And so we're creating paper bitcoin, in essence. Do you think we can get that to take off?
00:24:28.936 - 00:24:32.274, Speaker E: No, I don't kind of want to try.
00:24:32.312 - 00:24:32.466, Speaker C: No.
00:24:32.488 - 00:24:58.280, Speaker E: I don't know, Matt. I'll maxi you right here. I'll play that role. One, there's only ever going to be 21 million bitcoin. Two, if you have coins that are sitting in bid. Charlie, correct me if I'm wrong on the technicals here, but they're just partially signed bitcoin transactions waiting in the mempool. Is that right?
00:24:59.530 - 00:25:01.120, Speaker A: All, yeah.
00:25:01.650 - 00:25:07.360, Speaker D: And sometimes they may not be sitting in the minpal native may just be broadcast that anyone can sign.
00:25:08.130 - 00:25:15.418, Speaker E: Right. Either way, these coins are not burned.
00:25:15.594 - 00:25:17.950, Speaker A: Yeah, they're just bids.
00:25:18.790 - 00:25:22.770, Speaker E: They're just sitting there. Anything it creates idle bitcoin.
00:25:23.910 - 00:25:28.760, Speaker A: That being said, I think we can fud this into existence. So I might try it this week.
00:25:30.970 - 00:26:04.414, Speaker D: I'll give a little wind to Will's idea here. And you've heard of these rare satoshis, if you will. And I pulled up a marketplace magisat IO, where these things trade, and you can have an uncommon sat, the first sat of a block. And in a scenario where the market capitalization of uncommons could approach, in a speculative scenario, could approach or surpass that of the entire bitcoin supply, that creates a hilarious paper bitcoin distortion.
00:26:04.462 - 00:26:23.558, Speaker A: Think of it, Matt. Once Satoshi is worth more than bitcoin are in existence, I think we can easily make this FUD happen. So I'm going to make a fake Twitter account this week. I'm going to start spreading this FUD and seeing if I can get like, Predator pick it up. So I feel like that would be.
00:26:23.564 - 00:26:26.710, Speaker D: Your stamp of approval that the FUD is working.
00:26:26.860 - 00:26:29.290, Speaker A: Okay. We've spent a lot of time on NFTs.
00:26:32.110 - 00:27:21.734, Speaker E: In my opinion, because you have sets that are being dedicated to be held for even other reasons, because they're even more precious sets, they'll never move. It just makes the supply even more strict and harder to achieve getting different sets. Maybe you could take this to a bitcoin politics perspective and say that if there was a fork and an actual real disagreement on an ordinals type issue, then the economic majority of nodes could be distorted by how much people actually value certain satoshis on the ordinals chain. But that is a topic that I don't think we should explore.
00:27:21.782 - 00:27:22.650, Speaker D: We got mad.
00:27:25.390 - 00:28:10.946, Speaker A: Coin season two. Honestly, the next conversation is somewhat for bitcoin season two also, but we're going to go through it. So, Charlie, can you take us through bitcoin MeV and quantum cats? And for miners who are listening to this, Mev again stands for minor extractable value. It's the idea that because you are a bitcoin miner, you have potentially the ability to earn extra revenue by, say, paying out a ban for transactions or helping someone implement a non standard bitcoin transaction into the bitcoin blockchain. Something we see in Ethereum land quite a bit since they have so many different assets. But in bitcoin, it's popping up right now. And we saw one of the better instances of bitcoin MeV this last week because of bitcoin ordinals.
00:28:10.946 - 00:28:17.962, Speaker A: So again, apologies. If you're a bitcoin miner, you just want to hear about hash rate. We're taking you down a different road today for a little bit.
00:28:18.096 - 00:29:33.326, Speaker D: This is one of those things where if you're in bitcoin mining, you don't have time to spend all day on Twitter and online, but you want to at least be prized of what's happening. This is the kind of story you can use and tell over the dinner table or as you're unscrewing those faulty S 17s. So basically, there's these new assets on bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions, and sometimes they sell on the market, and sometimes these things will accidentally sell for way under the market value. And the way that transaction is settled is that it actually is a bitcoin transaction, specifically called a partially signed bitcoin transaction. And what happens is someone can sell one of these assets, in this case a quantum cat, for well below market value. That partially signed bitcoin transaction signed and thrown into the public mem pool, where eventually it will be included into a block and the seller will get their quantum cat, or the buyer will get the quantum cat and the seller will get the bitcoin. But because these mempools are public, because the nature of bitcoin's transaction set is largely public, people looking at it and watching it can observe and identify.
00:29:33.326 - 00:30:02.906, Speaker D: Wow. There is this transaction which has an underpriced asset they can come in and snipe that transaction and replace. They can alter it and replace basically where the quantum cat, the buyer's asset, goes. And they can basically purchase that from the public mem pool. And we call it sniping. And this is a form of MeV, or maximum extractable value. We saw this happen last week in a very public way.
00:30:02.906 - 00:30:35.910, Speaker D: One of these cats sold and it was sold for zero point 49 bitcoin, which is crazy. But the actual real value of this was close to 1.9 bitcoin. So there's about one and a half bitcoin of arbitrage to be gained here. That is close to $100,000 of opportunity to have basically a strategy to identify snipe and replace this transaction. So that's what's happened. We've seen this been happening more and more in bitcoin.
00:30:35.910 - 00:30:56.094, Speaker D: There's a lot of people doing this now, and it's becoming a little more sophisticated. And it's bringing with it a lot of conversation about bitcoin MeV. Because what if this happens at scale? How do we prevent or reduce this incentive? These are the conversations we'll be having a lot this year on this show and on bitcoin season two.
00:30:56.212 - 00:31:01.946, Speaker A: Got to rewind the chain, get rid of these ordinals. Some problems, dude.
00:31:01.978 - 00:31:16.162, Speaker D: I don't know. It's going to be really fun to talk about though. Really good time to dig into how bitcoin works and then maybe pull your head out of the mind sometimes and look at how the marketplaces work.
00:31:16.296 - 00:31:48.766, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited for next week, I'm going down to empower and having a lot of energy conversations for bitcoin mining, which obviously are also very important and interesting as well. I'm curious to see how much this MEV stuff is getting into the mental model of miners. I'm seeing it more and more. There was a spaces this morning on Twitter and I saw so many different bitcoin miners just listening into the conversation because I think they realize that there's possibilities for them. Making more money. Like marathon launching. Slipstream, I think was probably the best indicator of that.
00:31:48.766 - 00:32:28.010, Speaker A: And we're going to see more of it this year. I'm interested to see what tooling develops for, say, your pleb minor or your minor with 100 to 500 PETA hash being able to take advantage of bitcoin MeV likely won't be anything for a while, but it would be very cool to see that. We saw it develop in ethereum a little bit where some of these solo stakers were able to opt into certain protocols and get a little bitcoin or get a little MeV out of that experience, but not to the same degree that some of the centralized systems did. So that is what I'm looking for. Matt, any final thoughts on this one? Did you buy a cat or a wizard?
00:32:28.750 - 00:32:44.318, Speaker E: I haven't bought a cat. I haven't bought a wizard is your question. I'm waiting for the CTV inscription collection. I might be on that one. That might be mine.
00:32:44.414 - 00:33:18.598, Speaker A: Rubens. Rubens. Love it. Okay, let's go to the final topic for today, which again we have Charlie explain. This is a blog post from one of the better developers out there, zero XB Ten C. So shout out to them talking about how they went through via BTC's blocks and found some interesting problems with them that were causing via BTC to believe issue like basically stale blocks or blocks that just were not accepted by the network. Via BTC is a China based pool, or was formerly a China based pool.
00:33:18.598 - 00:33:42.142, Speaker A: I don't know exactly where their headquarters is now, but I think they have between ten and 15% of the network, and they're informally not allied, but associated, I'd say, with Bitmain. I don't think there's like a true connection there, I could point out, since I haven't gone through documents, but generally they're associated with Bitmain. So I'll throw over to you, Charlie.
00:33:42.206 - 00:34:52.490, Speaker D: Yeah, so oxb Ten C is a bitcoin researcher. Really sharp. Make sure to follow this guy's blog and you actually summarized it probably sufficiently will, that via BTC or via BTC was at risk of producing invalid blocks. And the way that this researcher identified this is you can pay attention to your bitcoin node if you have it, a listening node which listens to the network and see which blocks are being broadcast and relayed, you can identify, as he did, if pool is trying to submit an invalid block. And I would recommend you read through this post where he explains how and why it was invalid. In particular, one of my favorite sections of this is actually where this researcher talks through the actual step by step way that a block is validated according to the bitcoin core software. Specifically, via was trying to create an invalid witness commitment in the coinbase transaction.
00:34:52.490 - 00:35:09.120, Speaker D: So this is really interesting. I think as we talk about Amy V and different kind of block construction, as this narrative continues to become more important, we'll see a lot of interesting, very technical events like this.
00:35:09.490 - 00:35:29.240, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, as a miner, if you are using value BTC and you're using pplns like a payout structure where you're depending on the pool actually winning valid blocks. This affects you. Right?
00:35:29.690 - 00:35:31.640, Speaker A: Another topic we didn't bring up.
00:35:32.170 - 00:35:32.534, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:35:32.572 - 00:35:37.000, Speaker A: If you're structures in the wake of slipstream, maybe another week.
00:35:37.370 - 00:35:38.566, Speaker E: Maybe another week.
00:35:38.668 - 00:35:39.542, Speaker D: Another week.
00:35:39.676 - 00:36:16.670, Speaker A: There is a wild amount of bitcoin mining content out there right now. I could easily be doing three or four podcasts a week on all this information as opposed to last summer where it was hard to scrap together one quality bitcoin mining podcast per week. So I'm very thankful for that. I hope it does not slow down, but I suppose it's just the happening effect. And then I think also ordinals. The show is becoming increasingly technical, so we need to get back to our roots a little bit. I think if you're watching this or listening to it and you're enjoying it, go check out blockspace pod, Twitter handle.
00:36:16.670 - 00:36:40.450, Speaker A: You can find bitcoin season two there of Charlie. Our new website will be up very shortly. You can go to it now. It's just a newsletter, blockspace media, but the full website will be up sometime next week and you can find all our different podcasts, articles, content, events there. So I'll be doing a soft launch and then I'll be down at empower. So if you are listening to the show, come say hi to me. I'd love to meet new people, get to know new faces.
00:36:40.450 - 00:36:54.126, Speaker A: I don't think Charlie and Matt will be there. Matt said he's done with. Oh, well, just me. He's not even going to respond. He's that unhappy. Okay, now you have something to say.
00:36:54.228 - 00:36:57.070, Speaker E: Leave me to my charts. I don't need your conferences.
00:36:58.210 - 00:37:18.374, Speaker A: True. We need to get some charts from you on the website. Okay, we'll close out for this week. Thank you for listening to the mind pod. We will see you next week. On Tuesday, we have a show with Citria, aka chainway labs, talking about bitcoin roll ups. And then we'll have a lot of different oil and gas energy style bitcoin conversations after that.
00:37:18.374 - 00:37:22.740, Speaker A: Since we're recording down at empower with a few teams, we'll see you guys next week.
