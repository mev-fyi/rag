00:00:00.360 - 00:00:18.913, Speaker A: Hey, welcome back to the mining pod. It is our news roundup. Bitcoin and bitcoin mining news. Just Matt and I today. It's a little sad, but we're returning to our nostalgic older times here in the mining pod. So sit back and relax. We're going to jump into some sponsored announcements and then we'll go right into the conversation.
00:00:18.913 - 00:00:34.699, Speaker A: But before that, Matt, I want to talk about OP next, which we're going to have an ad read for later. So maybe I'm double tapping on this unfairly, but it's Block Spaces first tech conference. What can you tell me about it? We just talked about it. What can you tell the audience? Why should they attend?
00:00:34.787 - 00:00:49.099, Speaker B: I think if you're really interested in the future of bitcoin, really is, I guess, how I would couch it, and this is my outside perspective. Will did not prompt me that I was going to be talking about that.
00:00:49.227 - 00:00:52.267, Speaker A: I wanted a real answer from you.
00:00:52.411 - 00:01:31.809, Speaker B: It seems like a lot of one. It's a focused event. It's one day. Right. And each of the talks is basically about something to deal with on the technical level, what the future of bitcoin protocol may become. And so people that seem like they're leading the talks are people that have been in bitcoin for a long time and basically have thought a lot about this. And so you'll hear their thoughts on Covenants, bitcoin block size, maybe some of the new meta protocols you could allied more on the agenda.
00:01:31.809 - 00:02:05.221, Speaker B: But I think that's kind of like the general slant. I believe it is in Boston. I myself am looking to make the arrangements to come, but I think it's pretty cool that you guys are doing this, honestly. And it's kind of reminiscent to me of what Lisa was doing with bitcoin and kind of what the old scaling bitcoin conferences were like. And it's just very focused on what's this thing going to become and what kind of changes, if any, should be made to the actual protocol layer.
00:02:05.293 - 00:02:28.069, Speaker A: That was beautiful. Yeah, Lisa's done a great job with bitcoin. We worked pretty heavily to think about how scaling bitcoin worked back in the day. That 2015-2019 conference, that was pretty influential in terms of the block size wars and Segwit. And so we're kind of bringing back that spirit, even though we're not academics ourselves. It'll be Nov. 9, Fidelity center in Boston.
00:02:28.069 - 00:03:03.893, Speaker A: If you're in the Massachusetts region, from New York all the way to Maine, definitely come check it out. You can find tickets@opnext.dev and for our miners out there who are like, why would I care about bitcoin tech? Well, there's not only a lot of these proposals that could increase fees for miners and you'd get to actually talk with the people who wrote the proposals. It's a nice thing about this small conference is you can like talk to them face to face. But there's also some mining specific stuff. There's an activation panel talking about like how miners are going to influence a future soft work. And one of the foundry tech team leads will be on that panel.
00:03:03.893 - 00:03:30.021, Speaker A: So check it out. Okay, let's jump into our little opener and then onto the conversation. Are you a retail or institutional investor interested in bitcoin mining companies? The Miner Mag brings you free data and analysis from all major NASDAQ listed bitcoin mining operations. To know who stands out, check out Visualize Metrics and Data dependent stories@theminermag.com okay, Matt, we're back. It's just you and me and we have much to get to today. We're going to start with our difficulty update, as always.
00:03:30.021 - 00:04:02.683, Speaker A: Then we're going to show some bullish inflows for the digital asset ecosystem from your very own employer, CoinShares. It's not a paid slot, but they have good data, so we're going to use it. Then we're gonna go over to Ocean Pool. They unveiled their datum protocol, which is sort of like a alt take on strand v2 cleanspark suffering through the hurricane, but coming back online. Talk about that for a moment, then finish up with Swan Mining and what's been happening with them. Block space. The mining pod has been leading coverage on that.
00:04:02.683 - 00:04:18.491, Speaker A: So we'll go over the piece that Colin Harper wrote for us and then we'll finish up with a cry corner, which I didn't tell you about, but you'll see at the very end of the show. So if you stick around, Matt and our listeners, of course, then you'll hear about that. But we'll start with our difficulty update.
00:04:18.603 - 00:04:48.525, Speaker B: Yeah, so we're about halfway through the period last week we talked about how there was a major decrease in the difficulty. Right. Miners got a little bit of relief in a year that has been very difficult for miners. Right. A halving year where price maybe hasn't done as much as what people expected, even though it has risen quite a bit with the ETFs. There's not much to talk about on the difficulty front this week because we're about Halfway through. And it looks like it's going to stay exactly where it is.
00:04:49.345 - 00:05:01.371, Speaker A: Well, the reason that it's not that interesting is I think partly because of the hurricane. Right. Like a lot of hash had dropped offline. So we'll talk about that with Queenspark in a minute. But that definitely impacted this difficulty cycle.
00:05:01.513 - 00:05:25.551, Speaker B: Yes, background things have been at play, but on the whole, when you just look at what's the adjustment going to look like, it looks like we'll basically be flat. But we are about halfway through the period. So perhaps a lot of that power that went offline from the hurricane coming back online will actually give us a small difficulty increase. But we shall see what's up.
00:05:25.583 - 00:06:09.011, Speaker A: First, will we go to this Coinshares asset flow? I thought it was interesting. I want to give us a little bowl juice, so to speak. The last three weeks we've seen inflows of dollars into the larger crypto ecosystem. So Coinshares has tracked this for quite a while. And this is basically like week over week. What do we look like in terms of flows? If you're looking at the chart, which you can watch on YouTube or Coin TV, you'll see like the beginning this year was super bullish and every week there was just large inflows that was the ETFs. And then there was a drop off, say around like April, May, pretty flat during the summer and then kind of just like random spikes during the year.
00:06:09.011 - 00:06:41.161, Speaker A: Last three weeks though, like, seems like we're kind of having a good trend. A lot of this is just money flowing to bitcoin. Eth also saw a little money float into it and then of course some of this money is flowing in just for shorts. So they're thinking bitcoin price will go down. But generally speaking, we are seeing more dollars coming to the space over the last three weeks compared to the last 10 to 12 weeks, which I think is notable and pretty important. Five weeks out from the US presidential election.
00:06:41.353 - 00:07:11.781, Speaker B: Yeah. So background, basically we track all of the financial products across basically every country we can. Right. All the listed products that track a crypto where the underlying is Bitcoin or Ether soul, et cetera. So beyond just the ETF complex in the States, that's been a really interesting story this year. And basically if you take into account the last three weeks it's been going professional investors have been putting money into them. Right.
00:07:11.781 - 00:07:46.795, Speaker B: We're a little over 2 billion the last couple weeks and 1 billion just last week itself went into these products. 1.2 will showing on the screen if you're watching on YouTube, but it's been heavily focused on the bitcoin side. So 1.2 went in as a whole into all these sorts of products. But the bitcoin products itself, a billion has come into and from where into the United States products. So mainly Fidelity and the blackrock ones you could see on the screen.
00:07:46.795 - 00:08:26.875, Speaker B: If you're following along there, it's at 1.1 of the 1.2 billion came from the US and so just a little bit, I guess, of an appetite tracker on what sort of professional money managers are doing. Right. What is the interest, not from buying bitcoin itself, but buying through kind of these vehicles that are now accessible really globally and kind of new to the. To the US and so there's been demand recently. We hope it continues.
00:08:26.995 - 00:08:50.635, Speaker A: There has been demand. And these are better numbers than watching, like on chain analytics for miners or for exchanges. We see a lot of those class node charts. But it just like, in general, I disregard all that stuff because it's just so noisy. This sort of stuff from Coinshares is really nice. Again, this is literally not a paid slot, even though you work for them. This is just part of like my weekly routine is reading this stuff.
00:08:50.635 - 00:09:36.539, Speaker A: And like, the US is obviously leading here versus all these other countries. And then bitcoin is leading here in terms of like, asset flows. And that's generally a good sign. We saw that at the beginning of the year, obviously lots of inflows into the ETF products. The only thing I'll note, or one other note I should say, is that the grayscale investment assets year to date, obviously really big negative outflows, negative $19 billion, but they're slowly kind of trickling down and people are leaving that fund less, which I would suppose due to the fee that Grayscale has versus these other ETFs. It's probably because these people just are not really paying attention to their portfolios as much. I don't think grayscale actually changed their fee structure.
00:09:36.539 - 00:09:55.795, Speaker A: They made like a substructure where you can get a lower fee, but I think you had to roll your funds over into that. And I guess it's just investors who just are not actively checking and didn't really care to move into another ETF product. So that's kind of notable. But we'll leave that there unless you have any other thoughts now.
00:09:55.835 - 00:10:13.595, Speaker B: I mean, I think I'll just say general sentiment, I think is, at least for the people I'm speaking to, is the interest rate cut and the approval of options products has brought a bit of positive sentiment the last couple of weeks.
00:10:14.215 - 00:10:15.035, Speaker A: Yep.
00:10:15.455 - 00:10:24.111, Speaker B: But this is a mining podcast, so let's. What do we got? What's next?
00:10:24.223 - 00:10:55.443, Speaker A: Okay, let's go over to our friends at Ocean. We had Ocean on. When we did the bitcoin Nashville trip, we had Bitcoin Mechanic on. That's a really good show. So go check that out if you missed it got into a lot of the dirty details behind bitcoin mining, but Ocean Pool announced Datum. It's a new protocol similar to stratum V2, or I'd say like an alt take on decentralizing bitcoin mining. Let me read a little bit from their blog and then we will get into the discussion.
00:10:55.443 - 00:11:41.061, Speaker A: So quote Decentralized alternative templates for Universal Mining, AKA Datum was born out of a need to restore bitcoin mining to its decentralized roots, a time when miners truly embodied the role of building the blockchain by constructing block templates and submitting them to the network. Going down to the next paragraph, initially we considered tram v2 a protocol that promised to address some of these issues. However, after a long development period, it became clear that SV2 wouldn't be a viable solution in the near term. Further technical challenges convinced us that a new framework was necessary. This led us to create Datum, a protocol built from the ground up to return power to the miners and restore the decentralized nature of bitcoin. Oh, this pissed off a lot of people who like SB2, by the way, this week. So I want to talk about this because it's a good story.
00:11:41.061 - 00:11:43.805, Speaker A: Matt, first take on Datum My first.
00:11:43.845 - 00:12:06.703, Speaker B: Take actually reading the blog post was wow, they didn't feel stratum v2 was ready enough or feasible enough to implement, and so they made something on their own. And they did it pretty quick actually. Right. I would. I would anticipate unless they've had this going for a long time, but yeah, so I guess maybe some background on stratov2will.
00:12:06.759 - 00:12:08.831, Speaker A: Yes, that'd be an order.
00:12:09.023 - 00:13:23.475, Speaker B: Yeah. So yeah, my miners and mining pools basically have their own protocols themselves that help with the block construction process and actually creating a valid block and submitting it out to the rest of the network. It started with, I believe Get Work was what it called and then it became Stratum was an evolution kind of on top in the same strand of communication mechanisms for miners. And so Stratum V2 has been in the work for several years now. And one of the main features of Stratum V2 was to allow miners to select themselves what transactions should go into a block while still working with a mining pool. Because right now the way it works is that really mining pools are sort of coordinating amongst miners, but they themselves are selecting the transactions on their behalf. So in the guise of decentralization and censorship, resistance, really, of letting any transaction that gets submitted, not having discrimination get chosen into the chain, letting that happen at the minor level, which is much, much, much more miners than pools.
00:13:23.475 - 00:14:09.635, Speaker B: Right, that is supportive of censorship, resistance and decentralization. And so what Ocean is doing here is basically saying, no, we don't need this newer Stratum V2 protocol. We can basically pose our own solutions to miners that are mining with us. And I'm going to say one last thing, Will, before I throw it to you. They gave a discount for people that are using datum, I believe, on their pool fees. So miners get charged pool fees from mining pools for the service of being a part of the pool. And Ocean is giving a 50% discount to those who are actually using this datum protocol, which I thought was pretty significant.
00:14:09.635 - 00:14:12.483, Speaker B: Um, what'd I miss? What'd you think?
00:14:12.619 - 00:14:56.911, Speaker A: Uh, no. Great overview, SV2. The issue with it has always been that it's hard to get adoption for something like this because miners need a reason to do it, right? So it's always the issue with pools this, why would I join another pool? And you don't do this out of the nicest of your heart. You're running a business so you want revenue and people go to different pools because it's cheaper, where you get a discount on Asics, or maybe they throw really nice parties that you like being invited to. But for SV2, there's none of that really, that is going to incentivize you to move over. And so there hasn't been much. We announced demand launching on this podcast actually about a year ago, which was one of the first implementations of SV2 as a pool.
00:14:56.911 - 00:15:30.025, Speaker A: And I haven't heard of Demand even winning one block yet. So I think, just like, it's tough, it's a really tough business to move people over to do something like this. And I think Ocean looked at that and said, like, we have our own pool set up, why don't we just integrate our own thing? I don't know why they didn't integrate SV2 into like their own operation. And I just don't have the technology. Maybe you do. Maybe that's a good follow up for the mining pod with them or with someone else who works on SV2. Why? They kind of just use that instead of creating their own thing.
00:15:30.025 - 00:16:07.041, Speaker A: I think the thing that I walked away with was this was like another provocation from Ocean which kind of came out and did that on purpose. Right. Part of their marketing strategy was like, we don't like the block template issue right now with Foundry and mostly amp pool. So we're going to launch a new pool and decentralized bitcoin mining. Also, we don't like ordinals, so we're going to allow you to filter, quote, unquote, spam out. And now they're saying that SV2 isn't good enough for them and that it's, you know, it's not a near term solution, so they're going to kind of abandon it. And I think that will piss some people off.
00:16:07.041 - 00:16:35.665, Speaker A: But in a way that's what you have to do as a pool business. Right. Because if you're not pool someone else's pool, if you're not mining bitcoin, someone else will mine bitcoin. And so the edge there is often in your marketing as opposed to anything else. And so getting attention this way can be highly effective. I'm sure if we had Mechanic on the show again or someone else, I'd give some very good tech reasons for why they built Datum. But I'm sure if we got someone from SV2 on, they'd be like, hey, we've been working on this for like ever.
00:16:35.665 - 00:16:46.665, Speaker A: Why did you just abandon this project and not just put your ashrae behind it? So that's the extent of my thoughts on it. I think we need to do some interviews on the topic, however.
00:16:46.825 - 00:17:31.493, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd be interested in the interviews. I mean, I'm with you. It's like the incentive for a minor to kind of adopt constructing their own block templates. Right. And using some of these protocols. It's like I could see that if there was censorship on a broader level from pools on what transactions would be included and miners were like, oh, you know what, I can actually create a template that's better and that'll give me a more competitive edge and I'll select all the fees, all the transactions that'll give me better fees, the ones that's not being included. But that motivation isn't necessarily really there because it's just not happening at bitcoin on any sort of relevant scale.
00:17:31.493 - 00:17:42.541, Speaker B: Right. So I think there would be a push for it should that reality come. But as of right now, the way.
00:17:42.573 - 00:17:53.435, Speaker A: It stands, leave it to Ocean to stir the pot. A little bit again and bring up something like this. I dig it though. I like their style.
00:17:55.495 - 00:18:23.009, Speaker C: In the competitive world of bitcoin mining, one name stands out. CleanSpark, America's Bitcoin miner. At CleanSpark, efficiency isn't just a goal, it's our standard. Our sophisticated facilities are built and led by expert teams who care about bitcoin and the communities. We work in scale. We've mastered it. Our large scale operations have set us apart in the industry.
00:18:23.009 - 00:18:42.323, Speaker C: As examples of community oriented building, our track record speaks for itself. We navigate the complexities of the new economy with precision and with skill, continuously achieving operational milestones. Curious about how we do it? We invite you to discover the story.
00:18:42.379 - 00:19:09.801, Speaker A: Behind CleanSpark success@cleanspark.com Let's go over to our next story. We're going to talk about CleanSpark and the hurricane. So this is from our friends over at the block. Bitcoin miner CleanSpark restores 200 megawatts in the wake of hurricane Helene. So that just ripped through the southeast United States, mostly Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. And that's exactly where cleanswark has most of its operations, mostly Dalton, Georgia.
00:19:09.801 - 00:19:19.873, Speaker A: And they turned off a lot of their megawatts as this hurricane was coming through and they've been able to turn on while their megawatts. But let's turn over to this story.
00:19:20.049 - 00:19:56.135, Speaker B: Category 4 storm came through. I think 2 million people was the stat I sound I found of having power outages. So no surprise that mining operations kind of in the area. Right. Would also shut down. And so I think for CleanSpark in the region was 365 megawatts of which this story breaking is saying that 200 are back online and that the rest will be online at the time of recording. It'd be tomorrow, Friday, October 4th.
00:19:56.135 - 00:20:33.111, Speaker B: And so yeah, I guess like to position this in the broader context. We're supposed to have flat difficulty as we talked about at the beginning of the show. But we're about halfway through the period, maybe quite a bit more hash rate actually comes online. I think the differential for CleanSpark itself was about 7x. A hash is equivalent to the power that went off. And so that could be pretty significant depending on how many mining operations were out there and may actually move the needle in kind of a broader network context for miners.
00:20:33.303 - 00:21:09.583, Speaker A: I was actually thinking that there might be some hard PR against or like headlines against CleanSpark for turning back on. But obviously they're running an operation. They gotta make money. And a lot of these Operations probably have like their energy systems tied directly to the grid or are nearby the power station. So like probably get on pretty quickly compared to like residential zones where you have like power lines spider out all over residential community and like a tree knocks over a power line yet to fix that to bring on like 20 back homes. So I was wondering if there's going to be any negative PR about CleanSpark turning back on. So far I haven't seen anything.
00:21:09.583 - 00:21:47.783, Speaker A: And yeah, it's just part of being a bitcoin miner. You're going to get slammed for that. And it's also just a tragedy what's going on there. So there's going to be a lot of people upset, just pointing fingers. That aside, it shows you some stories or some good information about the decentralized nature of bitcoin mining where cleansmark has now five operations across the US So they have Wyoming, Mississippi, Georgia. They got the grid acquisition going in Tennessee and I think there might be two campuses in Georgia, but I could be incorrect. Regardless, they're still able to be on.
00:21:47.783 - 00:22:19.551, Speaker A: I think it's a really important story for some of these other bitcoin miners, like the riots of the world and maybe that's even why riot went after bit farms and tried to acquire them. Right. Like they were just in Texas. And there's political and geographic concerns. If you're mining off as in one spot and with how brutal the competition is in bitcoin mining, if you're offline even for a little bit, that can really impact your bottom line and you can go belly up. Luckily, cleansmark is very well capitalized. I have a lot of cash on the table and seems like they're able to get back online pretty easily without any issues.
00:22:19.551 - 00:23:06.533, Speaker A: It does look like the worst part of the storm was a little bit north of this and like east Tennessee, west North Carolina. But yeah, I think this is to me another story about the decentralized nature of bitcoin mining and just being careful where your operations are. And then also the fact that bitcoin is very, very impacted by natural world. We talk every summer about Texas getting really hot and then we see block time sort of move around a little bit and difficult to change. This sort of thing can happen as well. CleanSpark is one of those mega miners and they have tons of hash rate online and so when 300 plus megawatts goes offline that can impact difficulty for bitcoin. And we saw difficulty really not changes last week.
00:23:06.533 - 00:23:18.455, Speaker A: Now of course hash price is really low as well. So there's other things in there, but I thought it was just sort of an interesting story for how Bitcoin interacts with the natural world. It's not just a digital currency.

00:24:04.345 - 00:24:12.645, Speaker B: Are we at the cry corner yet? Because I don't know what it's going to be and I'm patient a little bit. I'm becoming not so patient in my waiting for this.
00:24:13.025 - 00:25:49.577, Speaker A: We got the Swan and then the crag corner and this swan story could be the cry corner but we did not make it that out of respect for the story. So Block Space the Mining Pod Really? The Mining Pod newsletter written by Colin Harper who's on the show quite a bit and you should definitely go subscribe if you're listening to this wrote this really awesome piece. Quote New filings raise questions about mining ownership in Swan lawsuit so I'll read a little bit from the beginning and then we'll dig into it. The TLDR is that Swan Mining sued a former employees and contractors who were running Swan Mining's operations. There is a very detailed filing going into the nature of the joint venture that Swan had with Tether. This document also showed that Swan had a investor relationship with Teller for the first time ever and so we detailed that on the podcast last week and we're just doing a follow up based on investigative piece that Colin wrote. So quote, On September 26, 2024, Swan Bitcoin, a bitcoin financial services company, filed a lawsuit against former employees and contractors for allegedly Colin has some fake words in this piece by the way, so I might mess up a few times Filching key components of its bitcoin mining business According to Swann's initial court filing, the team leads in leads and contractors responsible for its mining operation MAS resigned on August 8th and 9th, 2024, taking with them highly proprietary and confidential Bitcoin mining business tech, trade secrets, property and personnel.
00:25:49.577 - 00:27:08.885, Speaker A: New information from the defendant's court filings, as well as Swann's business documents, block space obtained, call into question whether or not Swann ever owned a mining business to begin with. So what we really go through in this story, I don't know if you read it, but also for the audience, is the fact that the defendants came right back with their own calls for dismissal of this lawsuit, stating that Swan didn't really own a mining business, that they were 20% of a GV with tether, that they were tasked with operating this JV, that Corey Klippenstein, the CEO of Swann, was also the CEO of the JV. He was removed from the JV, and the directors of the JV, who were both Tether employees, then told the employees of the JV to start running the operation independently of Swan. So that's their side of it. And it makes you think, like, actually what's happening on with this Swan mining story, Because Swan over and over again and a lot of public tweets and pronouncements talked about how this was their mining operation, how they got off the ground so fast. And we had them on the show in January of this year and they talked about getting 5x a hash up, and by the summer they were at over 11x a hash. And then all of a sudden Corey tweets that the operation is no more.
00:27:08.885 - 00:27:49.365, Speaker A: And you're like, how does something from 11x a hash go to 0x a hash so quickly? And we find out it's more of a managed mining service where they're basically kind of running ops for Tether. And then through this documentation, we find out, well, this was a jv. They didn't really have any rights to revenue for a time period until the payback period for the investment. And there's a lot of misrepresentation, or you could argue misrepresentation around, like, how this business was actually run compared to some of, like the public pronouncements. So for me, I'm waiting for more information. There has to be more since there's been this lawsuit filed. Who knows what that could be.
00:27:49.365 - 00:28:12.665, Speaker A: Tether was not sued in this, and that's a good note to make. And also correction from last week. Rafa Zaguri, who is the CIO of Swan and the head of Swan Mining, was not included in this. But there was a list of about 10 individuals who were sued and under now Company called Proton Management. Okay, that was a long diatribe. Give me your thoughts.
00:28:13.325 - 00:28:22.989, Speaker B: So if this does get dismissed, which, by the way, the filing had some very choice words for the defendants here from.
00:28:23.157 - 00:28:23.885, Speaker A: It was spicy.
00:28:23.965 - 00:29:02.151, Speaker B: It was very loud. It was a spicy thing to actually read. I'm not one to often read court documentation. Yes, but it did have some. It was kind of entertaining. If it does get dismissed, this is absolutely a case study and the importance of legal counsel in these matters. Because basically what I've gleaned from what Colin wrote is that they could walk away with next to nothing until this operation actually becomes profitable, until those that funded the matter actually get their money back.
00:29:02.151 - 00:29:27.901, Speaker B: And, you know, SWAN partially funded it. I think Colin wrote like 20% to tether's 80%. So that's not nothing at all. But that being said, like, the resources to put together a filing like, you gotta think about the broader implications on the. On the business here. Tough. It's like, it's an entertaining story to follow, especially in, like, kind of the.
00:29:27.901 - 00:29:35.761, Speaker B: The wake of the Riot Bit Farms debacle, kind of like slowing down. We got a new spicy nugget to follow.
00:29:35.953 - 00:29:54.205, Speaker A: We. We didn't really touch the end of the Riot Pit Farms thing, but they ended up settling and it got a little boring. Maybe we'll cover next week, but this one thing's really spicy. I'd push everyone to go read this. It's on Blockspace Media. It's like the first article you'll see it. Or if you just sign up to Mining Pod Blocks based on media, you will see it on there as well.
00:29:54.205 - 00:31:04.697, Speaker A: We had a nice surge in email signups this week because of this story, but there's definitely more to come. One thing that I'll push for as an open question is the public pronouncements of the Swan executive team and the Swan Twitter handle talking about their December 2023 raise, which had 205 million in credit and equity raised and then expected, I believe, 150 million in annualized revenue. And then if you look at the deck, which we received, the 2024 deck, it shows only 6 million in 2023 revenue, 20x difference. And it shows a very clear demarcation from the mining business. And so I think, like a lot of their public tweets and things like that, we're talking about the mining operation and they were kind of like showing everyone on Twitter that this mining operation was inside Swan, when really it was a jv. And maybe there's like a legal basis for doing that. As a partnership, and maybe Tether was cool with that, but to me, it just looks a little disingenuous because it's like.
00:31:04.697 - 00:31:19.131, Speaker A: It's not really. It's like something you're doing. Yes. But you didn't have any of that revenue per contract until the investment was paid back. So that's something. That's an open question. I wouldn't say it's really a ding on Swann yet, because we need more information.
00:31:19.131 - 00:31:32.467, Speaker A: But that is one thing I am curious about is the Dex revenue projections versus the actual court filings. We're seeing. Cry corner. You want to finish up with this?
00:31:32.611 - 00:31:34.843, Speaker B: At last, it's upon us.
00:31:34.899 - 00:31:35.427, Speaker A: Long last.
00:31:35.491 - 00:31:38.787, Speaker B: No, run it. I'm ready to see whatever it is they found.
00:31:38.811 - 00:31:57.525, Speaker A: Satoshi. According to an HBO documentary, they have cracked the true identity. The pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. That's according to this HBO documentary. And this was just reported by Politico. And so we're talking about it. You think this is real, man? You think it's over for Satoshi?
00:31:58.345 - 00:32:07.125, Speaker B: I can't wait for them to just say it's Nick Szabo. Oh, my God.
00:32:07.675 - 00:32:08.483, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:08.659 - 00:32:58.695, Speaker B: That's hilarious. I will be watching. The speculation has gone on basically since the release of bitcoin, and it is actually a marvel to me that in the modern digital age, someone actually could conceal their identity and release a project of such magnitude. I mean, we're talking over a trillion dollars, but even back when it was initially released. Right. It's combining together really niche pieces of technology that require a lot of expertise. And so you'd have to imagine that in those circles, people would know who the actual founder or, like, couple people were.
00:32:58.695 - 00:33:46.757, Speaker B: But the fact that has remained anonymous for this long and. Right. There's just a story of not spending any of the coins or the early coins as well, just holding them, disappearing. By having people basically step up mid-2010 to continue the project forward, the community really redoing a lot of the stuff that Satoshi had done. But Satoshi, genius in synthesizing all of the technologies that make up bitcoin. But well known amongst bitcoin developers today, or just developers in general, that he wasn't the best coder and that there were a lot of mistakes and bugs and all that stuff. It's such a fascinating story.
00:33:46.757 - 00:34:07.613, Speaker B: But the fact that so many people have tried to obsess over figuring out who he is. Right? He, she, they. And we have no clue. No clue. Like, it's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. So I don't know I'll watch the documentary but have they found Satoshi? No, I am 110% sure.
00:34:07.669 - 00:34:44.632, Speaker A: No, I, I decided that I know there's one person we know who it is not and that was Craig Wright. So rest easy tonight friends that we know who does not. Okay, we're going to close out there. Thank you for listening to the mining pod. If you enjoyed this give us a five star review.

00:34:44.632 - 00:34:53.196, Speaker A: He's a CEO of Hut 8 and we're talking about the new Bitmain units that they built with them. So it's a really awesome show. We'll see you guys next Tuesday.
00:34:53.300 - 00:34:53.444, Speaker B: Peace.
