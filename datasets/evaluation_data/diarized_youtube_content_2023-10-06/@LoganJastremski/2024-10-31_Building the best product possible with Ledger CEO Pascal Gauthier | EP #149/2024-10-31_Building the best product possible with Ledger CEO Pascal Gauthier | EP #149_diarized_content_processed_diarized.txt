00:00:00.360 - 00:00:39.613, Speaker A: We're trying to design products for everybody because everybody should feel welcome into this game. And even now, if it's my mother or your grandmother or whatnot. And so this is why you just said it. You know, there is a big focus on UX and ui, but there is a big focus on product. Prior to starting the recording of the show, we were discussing, you know, the difference between technology and product. And I think when you start an industry like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there is first, there is a focus on technology. And everybody talks about technology except that the mass and the consumers don't really think about technology, they think about products.
00:00:39.613 - 00:01:24.915, Speaker A: Like, what does it do for me? I don't really care what's the underlying technology. Everybody loves their iPhone, Nobody understand how the World Wide Web exactly works, and nobody care and should care. It's whether you have an appointment to book your flight on your iPhone that matters is not so much how that app is connected to the web and how data is being transferred back and forth, et cetera, et cetera. And so the same needs to happen with crypto. You know, I hear too many companies or too many protocols, etcetera, you know, talk about like the tech. And it's okay because for developers, you know, they want to hear about the tech because that's how they think about, of course, you know, developing around protocol and developing apps, et cetera. So there is an audience to speak about technology.
00:01:24.915 - 00:01:44.395, Speaker A: Now if you want to become a B2C business, like if you want to reach the consumer, then you need to talk about product. And so I guess that what we've tried to do with the stacks and flex at Ledger is to talk more about the product and what the product can do for you, rather than talking about like, what's the tech insight.
00:01:46.975 - 00:01:50.079, Speaker B: Pascal, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Really appreciate it.
00:01:50.207 - 00:01:52.887, Speaker A: Happy to be here and happy to hold my mic like this.
00:01:53.071 - 00:01:58.275, Speaker B: I appreciate you working with me on the fly. Kind of a true startup mode, so to speak.
00:01:58.395 - 00:01:59.123, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:01:59.259 - 00:02:21.041, Speaker B: Well, maybe to start off, I think you're obviously a very well known figure in the space, but I would love for you to perhaps tell the Ledger story of like how you came to be as the CEO. What are you guys really thinking about as the future of Ledger? I know it's a very broad question. You can really take it. You like?
00:02:21.113 - 00:03:02.835, Speaker A: No, it's fine. Look, I was the first investor in Ledger. I led the seed round, co led the A round, and when I did it, it's because I thought the founding Team was great and they had this vision of security using the chip and pin technology basically to do it. And chip and pin technology being a French invention, I was convinced that it was actually the best technology to secure secrets. I was convinced because I was told so. And now after 10 years on working on the matter, like I know. So now I know that actually what we have is actually the best and maybe the only way to really secure your secrets.
00:03:02.835 - 00:03:44.571, Speaker A: And first I was an investor, I was a board member, then I became president of the company and you know, co leading it with the founder, CEO Eric. And then in 2019, the board and Eric decided to appoint me CEO of the company. And I've been CEO for the past five years. And what Ledger is, is the security company at heart. We secure secrets. We started by securing cryptocurrency secrets, so sort of your Bitcoin first and then your Ethereum and then every other coin that there is in the, in the book now. But we are a security company and we will secure everything that is a secret for you online.
00:03:44.571 - 00:04:44.753, Speaker A: The goal for Ledger is to say that if you have digital secrets, they will be secured by ledger. And why do you need this? You need this for two reasons. One, hackers are more and more aggressive, and two, you have more and more digital secrets. Whether those digital secrets is directly attached to value such as Bitcoin and other coins and, or it's your passkey to log on to your favorite applications and, or it's your digital identity and or all of these things that have value for us, that are our secrets and that we want to safeguard. And so for that you will need a ledger. And why this is new and why this is interesting is because before online first you had very few secrets and new secrets had a little value. And as time goes by now secrets have more value because of bitcoin primarily and cryptocurrency primarily.
00:04:44.753 - 00:05:26.735, Speaker A: But you can see why now having access to Instagram, if your job is to do Instagram has a lot of value. And so protecting your access to Instagram with passkey is important. Now the question is, you know, do you want to dedicate your value to a third party or do you want to hold it yourself? And you know, with Bitcoin, that was that question, like, do you want your money to be at the bank or do you want to hold it yourself? But now same with your secrets. So you want Apple to hold your passkeys or you want to hold your passkeys yourself. And there are a lot of, you know, pros and cons you know, if you want to hold them yourself or if we want to delegate to Apple. But basically it's this idea that now if you want to be a sovereign individual and if you want to hold, hold what's dear to you, you actually can versus before where you couldn't.
00:05:27.595 - 00:06:03.075, Speaker B: I think that's a great place to start. Kind of the secret and being really kind of like creating kind of birved out of bitcoin, so to speak, it's really started to matter that you need to make sure that secret is actually safe, it is secure, not kind of online, so to speak. I would love for you guys or love for you to kind of continue upon the story of like that first device that ultimately the Ledger team started created and how that kind of vision continued to expand with product iterations over time.
00:06:03.195 - 00:06:49.015, Speaker A: Yeah, and I will just say something, you know, you just said like not being online sort of actually this was the reason why the device, because you have to be online. So there is a misconception in security and you know, our industry calls this cold storage. So there is a misconception that as soon as you're connected to the Internet, you're at risk. And so therefore being offline is the only way to be secure. Because that's not true. And actually our devices and the reason for Ledger to exist and from the beginning and so to the inception of the first device was to say that whether you connect it or not to the Internet doesn't change the security model. And actually with your ledger, if you're sort of offline, meaning you don't do anything with your coins, you're secure.
00:06:49.015 - 00:07:49.629, Speaker A: But if you connect your ledger to do a transaction with Ledger live, and so you connect your ledger to your phone or to your computer, but basically you connect your ledger to the Internet, you are as secure because it would be crazy to think that Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies will scale that as soon as you touch them and you want to do something with them, then you lose your maximum security level, if you like. That would be crazy. And that wouldn't scale. And so Ledger has developed products thanks to the chip and pin technology that from the beginning allows you to do any kind of online transaction really without your private key. Your secret to be revealed totally to the web, because when you do a transaction, you have to sign the transaction. To sign the transaction, you have to prove that you know your secret and you have two ways of doing it. Either you flash your secret entirely for that transaction, but then you're at risk of Someone taking it from you, or you flash your secret partially, which is what the Ledger device does.
00:07:49.629 - 00:08:14.565, Speaker A: So it flashes enough so the protocol knows that you know the full secret, but not enough so an attacker can steal the secret from you. So this is really what we've been doing from the beginning. I guess the first hit that the company had was really with a Nano S that was released in 2016 that's still working to date. A lot of it's a great device. Yeah, it's a great device. Like, you know, it works. It's an icon of this industry.
00:08:14.565 - 00:08:43.739, Speaker A: And then we released the X, the S plus. And now of course we get Stacks and Flex that are the two new products that just came out in the market where we really tried to do something around UX and ui. So it's much easier to onboard in self custody with Flex and Stacks. Most reviews that are coming out actually are really around that to say, oh, finally, you know, crypto self custody made easy to use. So which is exactly was the goal.
00:08:43.907 - 00:09:49.925, Speaker B: And to me, it's been a beautiful kind of product progression with the S ultimately kind of having a couple applications that you kind of had to choose to download. Then it kind of expanded over time. You could have multiple different assets on a ledger, kind of expanding the product suite and now even making the screen much larger, allowing for ultimately the much easier product use. I guess if you were to think in the future, you mentioned kind of sharing secrets or keeping those secrets safe. How can we continue to make Ledger or keeping our secrets safe at scale? Because I think you kind of go from the product iteration of making sure the technology alone kind of works, then kind of refining the ui, but I guess is the not even next iteration with the current iteration. Is that really just the goal of continuing to simplify the UI over time, trying to get our grandmas to use these devices?
00:09:50.985 - 00:10:34.645, Speaker A: So, I mean, yes and yes first and then no. I mean, first of all, I don't think we're designing technology for our grandmothers. You know, new technology are for the new generations. And you know, we've seen this time and time again, which is, you know, the elder generation will never be the early adopter. They will be the eventually the late bloomer or the late adopters of a technology, but never the first ones. And if you start developing technology for your grandmother and your grandfather, then, you know, new technology never sees the light. I love my mother dearly, but when I see her using her phone or my father using his phone and they both have an iPhone, they don't know how to really use an iPhone.
00:10:34.645 - 00:11:11.803, Speaker A: And it's okay. It doesn't mean that iPhone is a bad product because you know that the new generations and us, we cannot live without our iPhone or without our Samsung S23 on my account. And so that's a misconception. Like, you know, you cannot make new technology easy enough so your grandfather can use it. Now what you have to focus on is the new generations. Because if you're 50, 60, 70, you know, probably you won't care as much about cryptocurrency. And by the way, no offense to anyone, it's just like the way that technology works.
00:11:11.803 - 00:11:49.995, Speaker A: But if you're 18 today, probably that you're already a cryptocurrency native and for you, sort of bitcoin, NFT is your everyday life versus not if you're of an elder generation. And so we're trying to design products for everyone, really. So that was the no, and then now the yes. We're trying to design products for everybody because everybody should feel welcome into this game. And even now, if it's my mother or your grandmother or whatnot. And so this is why you just said it. You know, there is a big focus on UX and ui, but there is a big focus on product.
00:11:49.995 - 00:12:32.997, Speaker A: Prior to starting the recording of the show, we were discussing the difference between technology and product. And I think when you start an industry like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, first there is a focus on technology. And everybody talks about technology except that the mass and the consumers don't really think about technology. They think about products like what does it do? For me, I don't really care what's the underlying technology. Everybody loves their iPhone, nobody understand how the world wide Web exactly works. And nobody care and should care is whether you have an app to book your flight on your iPhone. That matters is not so much how that app is connected to the web and how data is being transferred back and forth, etc.
00:12:32.997 - 00:13:17.319, Speaker A: Etc. And so the same needs to happen with crypto. You know, I hear too many companies or too many protocols, etc. You know, talk about like the tech and it's okay because for developers, you know, they want to hear about the tech because that's, that's how they think about, of course, developing around protocol and developing apps, etc. So there is an audience to speak about technology. Now if you want to become a B2C business, like if you want to reach the consumer, then you need to talk about product. And so I guess that what we've tried to do with the stacks and Flex at Ledger is to talk more about the product and what the product can do for you rather than talking about like what's the tech insight.
00:13:17.487 - 00:13:59.695, Speaker B: And I think OGs know this, but perhaps the crypto native audience has nerded out, as you pointed out, too much on the technology because it doesn't really. No one really matters about. People don't get into the details about like tcp, IP or how the web actually works. They want to type in ledger.com and go to the website to be able to serve their needs. Maybe perhaps diving into the new flagship products. Can you kind of walk us through and uniquely kind of how you guys thought about the product design process compared to the first or first couple iterations?
00:13:59.855 - 00:14:32.255, Speaker A: Yeah. So first we build everything around a bigger screen and a different form factor which was an ask that was coming from the customers themselves. Like, you know, give us a bigger screen because we. It's hard to see on the X and the S plus. And also there is a need because as we all know, like, you know, sort of crypto is evolving. So you have more and more, you know, bigger transactions. You know, you have smart contracts, et cetera, some from the receive and send Bitcoin of 2015 to, you know, let's sign a transaction on a smart contract.
00:14:32.255 - 00:15:20.125, Speaker A: You know, sometimes you have to, you had multiple screen on the S plus and the X to actually validate the transaction where it's actually more sort of human friendly to have everything on one bigger screen, if you see what I mean. So sometimes it's just as simple as that. But when I say this, I'm already talking about product because one of the big initiatives that we're taking alongside releasing these products is something called clear signing. So most of what people do in this industry right now is they blind sign most of what they do with smart contracts, for example. And so that's very dangerous. And we know why, because there are a lot of ways to actually hack a blind signing. Like you don't actually know what you're signing and you don't know where you're sending the money to.
00:15:20.125 - 00:16:27.125, Speaker A: In a lot of cases it's okay, but in some cases money goes to the wrong address because some hackers have actually hacked your system, hack your computer, hack your phone to transfer the money elsewhere. There was actually recently a warning that has been sent by Binance, I think to their users, warning about this new Chrome extension that has a malware inside and redirects the phone to different addresses. When you try to, I Think pull your funds out of the exchange. Those kind of attacks sort of happen every day and they happen most of the time because of this blind signing bug, because I don't think it's a feature. And so what Ledger is trying to do now is to bring to the industry clear signing, which is every time you sign a transaction you have to clear sign, meaning that you have to see what you sign on the secure screen. And the screen is bigger. And so what X all of our products have a secure screen, you know, S plus X Flex, stacks.
00:16:27.125 - 00:16:55.285, Speaker A: But what Flex and Stack bring is that nature of the screen is bigger, it's much easier to use and so it's much easier to understand what you're signing in a clear manner. And so right now we're trying to onboard protocols with us. So Ethereum first and then a bunch of other protocols. I want to join a bunch of them dapps that want to join because everybody understand that issue. And this only happens if you have the right device to do it. And so this is one of the key features that comes with Stacks and Flex.
00:16:56.065 - 00:17:49.205, Speaker B: It's super important. The different phishing attacks kind of the blockchain technology is still not easy. And to your point, the products have matured, but they still have not gotten to the point where it's or they're just now, I would say getting to the point where it's becoming cheap enough, fast enough. Companies like Ledger designing the devices that ultimately push forward things like clear signing to actually get to mass adoption. I guess you've been in the industry, specifically Ledger and the blockchain industry for quite some time. I'm sure there's been a lot of surprises, a lot of ups and downs. What are some things that you would like to see even perhaps outside of the hardware industry, either on the applications or within the crypto industry as a whole?
00:17:52.785 - 00:18:53.105, Speaker A: I think we underestimate how early it is deal for the industry in terms of how many people are really in this industry, how many people are really using blockchain technology the way that you connect to the Internet, how many people connect really to blockchain technology to use an application that runs on a public blockchain, you know. So I think what I really like to see is sort of L1 L2s like, you know, like that, that protocol layer to be, you know, done and dry type of. And I don't think we're completely there yet. As in like I don't think that we are. I think we're getting, we're getting there, we're Getting into the moment where suddenly you can develop a bunch of applications that run on top of a public blockchain that makes the product. So typically Expedia is an application that runs on the Internet like we're not yet at the Expedia moments necessarily for crypto there is an embryo of the Expedia moment. There are a few things that are actually starting to work quite nicely.
00:18:53.105 - 00:19:59.389, Speaker A: So I think we entering that movement and especially on Bitcoin with the L2 is now being built on Bitcoin where you have the best security, the biggest liquidity. It's going to be very interesting to see in the next two to five years basically the kind of applications that's going to be built on top of the of a public blockchain where you will need your private keys to access those applications and eventually run all of this on the ledger to make the security and the usability of the whole thing. And where suddenly you have something where users don't really think about crypto anymore, but they think about the product. And so whether it's a super smooth defi experience where if you have dollars as a StableCoin Then you get 5 or x percent yield and this is where you put your savings. For example, the type of things where users won't come necessarily because it's crypto, but they will come because it's faster, it's cheaper, they make more money like this, et cetera, et cetera. Same with payment. For example, the Bitcoin white paper was all about peer to peer payment network which is not exactly the case yet.
00:19:59.389 - 00:20:23.615, Speaker A: Tether yet has 200 million users, so they claim lately. So you can see how all of this is progressing. But you know, ideally crypto should be a faster way and a cheaper way of paying whether me to you, you to me and or even paying a business. So I think payment on blockchain or with public blockchain, we should see this happen at scale in the next five years.
00:20:23.995 - 00:20:55.273, Speaker B: And ledger perhaps on the earliness of it may have more data than probably most in just terms of how many devices are actually have you guys sold? Because everybody likes to kind of quote these different numbers of Maybe there's perhaps 100,000 people actually on chain. A million, 10 million. Is there any obviously public numbers that you guys can talk about in terms of devices sold and things that you're seeing from the analytical side?
00:20:55.369 - 00:21:02.969, Speaker A: Oh yeah, for sure. So we sold 7 million devices over 7 million now. So we passed that bar like a few weeks or months ago.
00:21:03.017 - 00:21:03.563, Speaker B: Congrats.
00:21:03.689 - 00:21:40.295, Speaker A: Thank you. Now we're starting to sell those new devices and we can start seeing different kind of behavior with the new devices that we saw with the old ones. As in people use more services and trade more with the new devices because we just made it easier. So there is a direct impact on consumer behavior just because it's easier. And so therefore, before it's a bit cumbersome, so you're like, oh, I'm not going to really redo that trade. And now it's like, wow, it's so easy, so I might as well do it type of thing. So, so we're very pleased to, to actually see this happening.
00:21:40.295 - 00:22:17.729, Speaker A: And so 7 million. And so how many users are really using like public blockchains directly? You know, because, you know, sometimes you see a Number is like 500 or 600 million people with crypto, okay, but most of these people actually have an account on crypto.com, binance, OkX, Bybit, etc. Etc. And so they're not really crypto users, they're crypto investors. And so they bought like Bitcoin on Binance, the same way that you buy an Apple stock on, on Robinhood, for example. And by the way, that's all good and well, because the prices go up, the blockchain is more secure, there's more liquidity.
00:22:17.729 - 00:22:55.987, Speaker A: And so therefore this is all good for the future of building an application layer on top of Bitcoin. So I'm not complaining about this, but I'm just saying that, you know, most people actually are not in the blockchain economy, they are in, you know, the exchange economy. And you know, third party exchange off chain. Now when you look on chain, what's happening? We, we did, we did look at Ethereum addresses the other day. Ethereum, an Ethereum address is a good proxy for a unique user. And so you have 100 million, something like 120 million addresses or 115 million addresses, something like that. So that's 150 million users, which is a lot.
00:22:55.987 - 00:23:37.739, Speaker A: However, I think it's 100 million that have less than $160. Of these 100 million, you have 80 million that have less than $16. And so you only have like 15 to 20 million, I can't remember the exact number that have more than $160. And for us we look at this because it's relevant. Like if you have very little value, if you have $16, you're not going to buy like a ledger, you're not going to buy even like A, the S plus that comes at 79, let alone stacks at 399 and flex at 249. So we have zero game with people with less than $160. As soon as you have more than $160, you become a ledger customer.
00:23:37.739 - 00:24:01.875, Speaker A: Because then my question was, every time I go to a conference and I say, who's got a ledger? I got between 50 and 100% of the room raising their hands. And I was like, yes, but we only saw 7 million devices and there are 500 to 600 million. And so I couldn't do the math. And now we've done the math. There are not many people that have money on public blockchain and they're actually using the crypto directly on public blockchain is between 10 and 20 million users. I would say that's it.
00:24:01.995 - 00:24:29.217, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that sat is definitely important for application engineers because I think people try to build applications for a billion people when kind of like the early days of the Internet, you have to really go 0 to 1 with the first hundred thousand. And typically, if you're designing the device or a platform, a product for a billion people, that is much different than what you initially start with. And continuing to iterate till that point.
00:24:29.361 - 00:25:08.649, Speaker A: Yeah, no 100%. But look, in some countries they might use tether and $160 on a software wallet, and that's still a good use case for crypto. That's not a business for us. And actually, if you have $160, I wouldn't necessarily recommend that you get the highest grade of security with your ledger in its actual form today. But as soon as you have value that you need to protect, then I would recommend, okay, get a ledger and protect that value like that. So I think a lot of things are happening in different ways. I think software wallet, low value payment is something that is happening in many countries.
00:25:08.649 - 00:25:38.625, Speaker A: You can see it happening in South America, you can see happen in Lebanon, et cetera, et cetera. So use cases are definitely being built on top of public blockchains right now and at scale. You know, Tezer is a business that is at scale being built on top of blockchain. And that actually serves many purposes, but including, you know, sort of payment for users. You know, Tether on Tron I think is 65% of all tether and is very, very active in terms of payment system them.
00:25:38.665 - 00:25:49.257, Speaker B: So I think most people are kind of surprised by how active the Tron community has been really in stablecoin payments. It's kind of a Silent sleeper?
00:25:49.441 - 00:25:54.377, Speaker A: Oh, very much so. Every time I ask someone like I can transfer you tether, I always get a Tron address.
00:25:54.481 - 00:25:54.793, Speaker B: Really?
00:25:54.849 - 00:25:55.201, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:55.233 - 00:26:26.915, Speaker B: That's surprising. Maybe it shouldn't be, but Tron has gotten quite a bit of adoption in terms of, I mean there's kind of like the hardware wallets that obviously Ledger makes and then kind of the self custodial wallets, generally browser extensions today. How do you view perhaps over the long term the difference between the pure hardware device versus just a Chrome extension, that maybe these people that don't have enough economic value to buy one of these hardware devices?
00:26:28.815 - 00:27:07.169, Speaker A: Well, I think depending on your use case and what's available, you need to figure out what's the compromise you're willing to make. At Ledger we make no compromise on security. And so therefore what you will get from us is always maximum security. And it comes at a cost, sometimes $160 today could be $16,000 tomorrow. So you need to protect future value. But it depends the situation that you're in. There are some countries where we still have a lot of work to do in terms of the basics, right.
00:27:07.169 - 00:27:41.063, Speaker A: So typically Tether on Tron, we just started supporting it like a few weeks ago, we didn't have it. So when you say we also had the blind spot to Teza on Tron and one day we realized, oh shit, it's actually really big and we're not providing the service to our customers. So we tried to sort of make a mand and now make it available. But it's, it's something that is happening. So there are many, many things that are happening in the world. Typically we're not well distributed in many countries. So also if you're in Brazil today, it's not so easy to buy a ledger.
00:27:41.063 - 00:28:16.805, Speaker A: We are starting to have local distribution, but we're not quite there yet. And to buy a ledger on ledger.com and ship it to Brazil has a lot of costs in terms of clearing customs, et cetera, et cetera. So we're really trying first to, to really make sure that ledger can be distributed evenly everywhere in the world. And using sort of distribution partner and all of these to make sure that you can get a ledger at a fair price in your country. So my point is we're not there yet in terms of building even the basics.
00:28:17.825 - 00:28:41.295, Speaker B: Generally costs will come down over time. You guys have a variety of different product suites that people can kind of choose across the dollar amount spectrum and continuing to just expand your general footprint. Do you believe kind of long term, like Most people today have smartphones. Do you believe over the long term, most people will have these hardware devices?
00:28:42.555 - 00:29:14.835, Speaker A: I think it's inevitable that you have secure hardware and a secure screen in the future. Now, would that be a ledger? I think so. Will your phone be more secure than today? Maybe, but it's difficult because if you try for the phone to be a very entertaining machine and also a security machine, it's very hard to do the two at the same time. And the example that I always use is if I give you a billion dollar worth of gold to secure.
00:29:16.595 - 00:29:16.947, Speaker B: You'Re.
00:29:16.971 - 00:29:43.347, Speaker A: Going to do Fort Knox, right? Like you're going to do a building that is just to secure gold. You're not going to have in that building a nightclub, a daycare center and a shopping mall. You know, you will have a second building to do that. So you have the building for entertainment, you have the building for security. Same thing I think is happening when you do hardware security. If you try to have your device do too many things at the same time, sort of play Netflix, do WhatsApp, et cetera. And on top of that, secure very well.
00:29:43.347 - 00:30:28.129, Speaker A: Your cryptocurrency, it's a recipe for disaster because you're just making it so much harder to really secure. So I think security is going to become more important because people will have more assets, digital assets, that they need to secure online. And so I think five years ago I would have said, yeah, it's going to be a necessary evil. Today, with the latest product that we've taken to the market, I think is very cool, you're going to have a cool security device to secure your private life and to delegate authority to use some of the stuff that you control. So imagine now you have your identity. So today you actually own your identity, right? So it's issued by your government, but you have your passport with you. It's physical.
00:30:28.129 - 00:31:10.655, Speaker A: You have it with you, so you control it, you own it, right? Tomorrow that passport will be digital, okay? But that's still your identity. What you don't want is someone to steal your passport online, right? So you will need to have it on, on the ledger somehow. And what you're going to be able to do on your ledger is super interesting. You're going to be able to go through borders like you just did when you come to Singapore. But equally, you will be able to prove that you're more than 18 with sort of zero knowledge proof. You're going to be able to prove, I'm going to be able to prove that I'm French but nothing more. Because, you know, sometimes you have all these services, like, you know, prove me that you're from the.
00:31:10.655 - 00:31:38.191, Speaker A: That you're from the region. Like, prove me that you're American. Because if you're American, you have access to this and that, and if you're not American, you don't have access. Okay, I can prove to you that I'm American, but I don't want to flash you my whole ID. Prove me you're 18. There is free online porn for everyone. And the only way to access is to say yes or no whether you're 18 or not, which is not very satisfactory because you actually don't want the young generation to be raised when they're super young on free porn.
00:31:38.191 - 00:32:15.471, Speaker A: I don't think it's very healthy. What if suddenly with your ledger, you could say, okay, I can prove to you I'm 18, but that's it. Because I don't want to give you my name and everything, but I can prove to you for sure that I'm 18. And so if you take that now, you can vote with your ledger, you can say, okay, I'm American. I'm allowed to vote, and my vote goes to whatever my vote goes to. So you can see how all these security device goes from sort of bitcoin only to suddenly it secures most of your secrets and allows you to use them and to connect to public blockchains where tokens can be transferred, et cetera. And they can be a token to vote.
00:32:15.471 - 00:32:19.195, Speaker A: It can be a token to prove some form of identity, et cetera, et cetera.
00:32:20.615 - 00:33:08.285, Speaker B: And it kind of goes back to what we started off the podcast with, was that secret that you ultimately need to keep safe but share proponents of it, and I think it is very interesting as you have your driver's license, your passport, zero knowledge proofs to selectively reveal information. This technology that perhaps bitcoin enabled getting private keys in the hands of everyday consumers may be the trojan horse to make a lot of this really interesting stuff happen. Prior, why do you feel like some of the phones, whether that's Apple, Android or other manufacturers, have kind of been a little bit more slow to adopt some of this technology?
00:33:10.185 - 00:33:53.395, Speaker A: Well, they do, actually. Every phone that comes out now is more secure than the previous version. The phones are ultimately flawed because you can hack them from the operating system, and operating systems have never been designed to be fully secured. And the reason is you didn't have the kind of value that you have today to secure. If bitcoin had existed right at the beginning, you would have had absolute security right away because it's bad that your email is hacked. It's terrible if your money is gone. It's a life changing thing.
00:33:53.395 - 00:34:42.971, Speaker A: The fact that your email is hacked, it's okay, can get you into some trouble. But it has happened to sort of all of us and you know, no one actually really, I mean, you can suffer from it, but not to the extent of, you know, losing your whole wealth because sometimes somebody had access to your crypto and took everything from you. And granted you can, you know, have the cup look for your money, sometimes you can retrieve your money, sure. But you know, you go into a world of pain. That is, that is very different. So I think, you know, first phones were not designed to do this and now, you know, everybody's got a vested interest to keep it like slightly open so everybody can look into it from time to time. And finally, you know, phones are not designed to be 100% yours.
00:34:42.971 - 00:35:33.147, Speaker A: They're designed to be an extension of a service that you're the customer to, like a third party service. You're either a Google customer or you're an Apple customer. The phone, and especially now with AI being injected into it, like the phone is not so much your, you're not so much the master of your phone, it's more the phone that is your master. And with your ledger, you are the master of your ledger. And I think it's a very different philosophy in terms of how you develop products. Either I develop a product so only you can use it and only you can control it, or I develop a product where it's, you get into a system and you delegate authority to that system. So from a security standpoint, you don't make the same choices whether you're in one world or the other.
00:35:33.147 - 00:36:02.411, Speaker A: And I think, you know, it's okay. I think people will still have a phone in 10 years and phones are great devices. But like we said, I think you're going to want to delegate authority to third parties still in the future. You're still going to have a bank probably. However, now you have the opportunity to keep authority on some of the stuff. And I think this is really the dichotomy, it's not really sort of what the product does, but also is what capability it gives you. And so now I can keep my stuff.
00:36:02.411 - 00:36:34.195, Speaker A: And for some of the stuff I want to keep it. I'm sorry, my passport, I want to have it with me and the day is digital. I prefer to have it with me rather than give it to Google. And by the way not many people know this when you have a Google account, and the same with any other account, I'm not pinning Google down. People don't realize that when you set up your account at the end they sort of give you a 24 word things. They say, hey, in case you lose access, this is your seed phrase, basically which nobody writes down. And so when you lose access to your Google account, if you don't have your seed phrase, you're fucked.
00:36:34.195 - 00:37:23.417, Speaker A: You're locked forever out of everything. It happens to me on a Microsoft account before and I was not shocked, but I realized that actually you can get locked out of your account. And I was writing to Microsoft and they say, yeah, sorry, there's nothing we can do for you. So they do have some kind of like seed recovery mechanism in place, except that they don't really push it the way that we are pushing it in the crypto world because the seed is everything. And so with seed recovery mechanism that we put in place at ledger with all of these things, your ledger is probably the best way to keep your secrets because you have many ways of getting access back to your ledger, even if you lose the access to your account or the access to your ledger because you have that seed phrase. And now with ledger recovery you can actually protect it pretty nicely.
00:37:23.481 - 00:38:08.891, Speaker B: And I would love to talk about that because I think that perhaps 12 or 24 seed phrase. It's not that it's a bottleneck, it's just normal people aren't used to signing up with or writing down kind of these seed phrases. Ledger recovery, obviously a very interesting point to help people continue to recover their ledger and their assets if they need to in the future. How do you guys plan to continue to iterate or innovate on simplifying? Kind of like the onboarding process for ledger. Whether that's ledger recovery or in the future, are we ever going to be able to remove the 12 or 24 cover word recovery?
00:38:09.003 - 00:38:53.583, Speaker A: No, I don't think we'll be able to remove them. Like you know, that's here to stay now we can make it much easier. So typically with the X and with sorry stacks and Flex, what we've done is to massively simplify UI and UX to onboard the user. I'm not even talking about the 24 words but just like how do you onboard into self custody in a manner that is sort of very comprehensive, very educational and fast? You know, that's one thing. And then you know, ledger recover is here to, you know, help you with the 24 words. So you know before it's like oh, you write it on a piece of paper or on a metal plate and you know, good luck. Now you know you have an online backup that is super easy to use and you can retrieve by just the show of your identity.
00:38:53.583 - 00:39:54.235, Speaker A: So it's not a kyc, but it's just you present your identity and then the system knows it's you and only you can retrieve the encrypted shards of your seed phrase. I think we're going to keep on working on this under an umbrella that we think of like Ledger Care, which is more education and more services around helping users understand how to set up, understand how to gain access back, understand, understand what this all is. Because it is one of the big not problem but is one of the big problem of the industry. If you want to onboard 100 million users into self custody, you need to have a smoother experience when it comes to set up your device. What do I do with my 24 words and can I call someone if I need help? That kind of thing. So it's really something that going to push in 25. We started with Ledger Recover.
00:39:54.235 - 00:40:51.501, Speaker A: When I keep on working on this, I mean think inheritance for example, like what happen if I die, you know, that kind of things, which is a big question for a lot of people. And we're going to, you know, put all of this under the Ledger Care umbrella because it's, you know, something that our users are asking for. And you know, when we had the Ledger Recover clash, let's say a lot of people were sort of complaining rightfully, wrongfully about like the service. But those that were silent are the people that write to our customer success saying hey, I lost my device and I lost my 24 words. What do I do now? And to those people you have to write we're sorry because now there is nothing that you can do. So when you write these emails you're thinking, okay, how can we do better so we're not in that situation again because that typically is a situation where you can see that this market never scales. If you don't have a better answer, then we're sorry for your loss.
00:40:51.501 - 00:41:31.925, Speaker A: Because when you have a little bit of money in Bitcoin, okay, sorry for your loss, you can recover from this. But what now if you have your identity, what now if you have your real estate deeds, what if you have your whole life into crypto and then it's not okay. The sorry for your loss thing is not okay. And so you have to sort of cater for the future and where there is much more value and where it matters for people. You know, some people sometimes lose everything in crypto and that's sort of heartbreaking. And so therefore we had to do something about this and we will do much more in 25 around this to make sure that you never lose your access to your crypto.
00:41:32.345 - 00:42:26.315, Speaker B: Yeah. And going back to your point earlier, it's creating better products. And I think crypto, perhaps because it was maybe born as like a little bit anarchist, overthrow the government with bitcoin. At least in the early days, the cypherpunks maybe have not had as much focus on like once we go from zero to one in the early adoption, the first 100,000 million people, sure, maybe these pain points are fine for them, but as you actually go to mass adoption from a million to 10 million, 10 million, 100 million, you're going to have to fix some of these pain points. You're going to have to offer a different level of security, different level of services to help people recover assets if they potentially lose access to it.
00:42:26.395 - 00:42:37.907, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And the key word for me is optionality. I respect everyone in this industry. I see a lot of people that say, well, I will never use Ledger recover. Fine. I mean, don't. It's okay.
00:42:37.907 - 00:42:57.935, Speaker A: You have your own setup. I understand people have had their own setup for a while. We work with a lot of hackers at Ledger. We have a lot of cryptographs, et cetera. You know, these people are very savvy, they know what they're doing. So there are some services that they don't need and that's okay, but it's not everybody like them. And so you need to have optionality and a product for everyone.
00:42:57.935 - 00:43:33.329, Speaker A: I just met with someone at lunch that had like five different ledger and five different ledger recover. And that's a good setup for him and it's okay. And I respect that and I understand that for other people it's not a good setup and they don't have to use it. So my job is not to tell people what to do. My job is to give them optionality so they can choose and actually choose what the best path forward for them, the kind of device that they need, the kind of services they need associated to the device. Knowing that you always stay in control, you can only you can decide what your device can do. Ledger doesn't have access Ledger.
00:43:33.329 - 00:44:04.113, Speaker A: There is no funny business that Ledger is doing with your device. And by the way, like, you know, trust is built over time. So people say, okay, but maybe, you know, you know, with Ledger Recover that, the big thing is that maybe we use this as a backdoor to, you know, they don't know what to backdoor to do. What? I don't know. But this, you see over time, after six months, one year, two years, you know, Ledger has been in business for 10 years. You know, this is how you build credibility in security. You have a lot of ways to build credibility.
00:44:04.113 - 00:44:29.561, Speaker A: You can do security audits by third party, which we do. You can have certifications of the products, which we do. You have all of these things. And yet people say, no, no, no, but it's not enough. We don't trust you. It's okay not to trust us, but time tells. And so when you look at a product, you look at the history of the product and the history of the service to see.
00:44:29.561 - 00:44:45.045, Speaker A: So if someone doesn't want to use Ledger recovery for the first day, I understand that. But after one year, two years, three years, if thousands of people are using it, they're happy with the service and the service behaves the way it's supposed to behave and is not being hacked, et cetera, it probably means it's a good service.
00:44:46.225 - 00:44:56.173, Speaker B: I appreciate the optionality. Again, people have the freedom to choose what they want to. If they don't want to do it, great. If they want to use it, more power to them.
00:44:56.309 - 00:45:28.173, Speaker A: Exactly. And also, you know, I think the other day I was on stage and someone said to me, someone booed me on stage. And I was like, wow, this first time I got booed on stage, I thought, but the guy was funny. And actually we laughed about it. It was like, why are you booing me? And it was just the day after the ledger recovery incident, he was like, he's booing me because of ledger recovery. And we're still in the midst of education, explaining what it was, et cetera, et cetera. And our communication when we first launched was terrible, to say the least.
00:45:28.173 - 00:45:57.217, Speaker A: And so we had to make amends and explain why. And to my surprise, it was like, no, I'm not bullying you for this. I'm booing you because you guys are supporting Ethereum. And I'm like, And so one of the clash with Ledger and people forget about this is the day that we decided to support Ethereum. At the beginning, it was Bitcoin only. And to support Ethereum was, for a lot of people, you know, a crime almost. And the guy was still, you know, in.
00:45:57.217 - 00:46:31.803, Speaker A: So that was what, in 2022? I mean, you know, 23 or whatever, like you know, recently and so many, many years after we supported Ethereum was still booing me, that's crazy. And I said, look, you know, you had like so many years, but he was still a Ledger customers. And I had fun with him. After we, we talked, I was like, are you still a Ledger customer? He's like, yeah, I love Ledger. And I'm like, but, you know, if your problem is that we support Ethereum, why don't you go to a Bitcoin only wallet? There are those options. And so I guess it comes down to, you know, sort of longevity of being in business, being a solid company, having a great product. And so that's our focus.
00:46:31.803 - 00:47:01.473, Speaker A: We want to have a great product. And I think with Stacks and Flex, we differentiate with the rest of the industry because we actually bringing something new in this hardware wallet industry that no one else has done. And, you know, and we love our competitors, we love competition because that's what makes a market and a business. So we wish all of our competitors well, but we have to lead, we have to make decisions, we have to push forward. That's the role of Ledger and that's what we're trying to do.
00:47:01.609 - 00:47:28.885, Speaker B: I love it. As we're kind of wrapping up the podcast, maybe last couple minutes, what are you uniquely looking forward to within the crypto industry or even at Ledger? Maybe what would your kind of advice be to the crypto community on either Ledger or things that you're excited about within the next six to 12 months within the crypto industry?
00:47:31.625 - 00:48:43.795, Speaker A: So I don't get excited about many things because my job is to be the security layer from where everything can be built. And so therefore, I'm kind of agnostic to what's happening and I want to make sure that I support everyone and everything. And so we're building Ledger as an open platform so you can build on top of it, et cetera. So my point is, I don't want to choose, like, if you need security and if we support the protocol, I want you to be sure that we'll do a maximum to provide you with the best service. I'm not here to judge whether you should do that coin, that other coin, et cetera, et cetera. So our big focus right now is to really work closer from the different either COIN foundations or the different developer groups, etc. So we are always sort of up to speed on the latest L1 or L2 development because the market moves extremely fast and sometimes it happens that, you know, development goes fast and, you know, we cannot always be on Top of things.
00:48:43.795 - 00:49:32.301, Speaker A: If we don't get the help from third party developers and if we don't get the help from foundation that, you know, sort of prioritize the development and make sure that whenever they do something, it's available also on Ledger to bring security to their customers. And so typically that's the Clear signing initiative that I'm talking about. Like, we've been talking about Clear signing for a long time. It was of no interest to a lot of people and suddenly the market switch and now people are like, okay, so we need clear signing. And it's all in the spirit of bringing what's best to the user because in the end, if users lose funds, everybody loses. It's security is paramount to this industry because if this industry is not secure, there is no industry, there is no crypto, nothing is happening. And so we very focused on, you know, working closer with different COIN foundations and different developer communities.
00:49:32.301 - 00:49:48.725, Speaker A: So we always on top of things up to speed. And so this is why we're working a lot on developer tools and so on and so forth. So this is our big push and this is the, you know, what we see happening in the future Ledger being much more of an open platform rather than closed source environments.
00:49:48.845 - 00:50:12.581, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, perhaps we can end it there. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Really appreciate you opening up to the crypto community. Hope to see you on many more podcasts and the Ledger team. You guys are truly a vital part of the community and everybody loves to hear what you guys are doing and your thoughts on future being building that bedrock for security of the entire industry. So thank you again.
00:50:12.653 - 00:50:14.093, Speaker A: I appreciate that. Thank you for having me.
00:50:14.149 - 00:50:14.325, Speaker B: Thank you.
