00:00:00.240 - 00:00:02.262, Speaker A: Thank you, Chris. I really appreciate your time.
00:00:02.406 - 00:00:04.278, Speaker B: Yeah, likewise, Logan. It's nice to be here.
00:00:04.374 - 00:00:08.382, Speaker A: And also shout out, empire down in New York City.
00:00:08.446 - 00:00:10.358, Speaker B: Yes, thank you, Mike. Thank you, Empiredao.
00:00:10.414 - 00:00:42.244, Speaker A: Yes. Thank you, Mike. Beautiful location and really cool spot for everybody in the crypto community to kind of gather and have a single spot to build. If you haven't checked it out, it's a super cool spot, but, yeah, thank you. We initially met in Austin and grabbed some couple drinks and just got to chatting a little bit. But I think your background is super unique. The product that you're building is super unique.
00:00:42.244 - 00:00:42.964, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:00:43.012 - 00:00:43.732, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:43.876 - 00:00:57.350, Speaker A: So maybe, I think what would be an interesting jumping off point is kind of your background holistically and then kind of maybe transition into, like, how you got into web3.
00:00:57.510 - 00:01:28.780, Speaker B: Yeah, that sounds great. So I'm Chris, and we're building dialect, which is a smart messaging protocol for Dapp notifications and wallet toilet chat. I'll get into all that in a little bit. What we mean by smart messaging, what our thesis for web3 messaging is. My background is actually in physics. I did my PhD in the experimental atomic physics at Columbia. This is like precision measurement, metrology, atomic clocks, quantum computing.
00:01:28.780 - 00:01:30.684, Speaker B: Stuff I learned pretty quickly.
00:01:30.692 - 00:01:31.440, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:01:31.860 - 00:01:33.172, Speaker B: Yeah, it's fun.
00:01:33.236 - 00:01:34.004, Speaker A: It's cool stuff.
00:01:34.052 - 00:02:03.490, Speaker B: It's like an amazing field. But I learned pretty quickly that what I really love to do is write software. So right after grad school, started building in technology, actually ended up eventually getting to split the difference and. And work at a quantum computing startup, Rigeti computing. It's like one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Like, just amazingly talented folks trying to solve, like, legitimate moonshot problem. I joined the company when it was just a few dozen people, kind of like a supercharged grad student lab.
00:02:03.490 - 00:03:05.342, Speaker B: Started on the physics team, but writing a lot of software, then saw the organization scale like five x in size over the course of three years. And we ended up launching something called Quantum Cloud Services, which was like AWS for quantum computing, and got to lead one of the three teams that brought that technology together. And the fun part for me personally was like, we actually was working on. Given all the crazy stuff happening under the hood, at some point some user somewhere is going to have to sign up for this service and actually have a self service experience onboarding to using the high performance compute. So it was more like for the first time at Rigetti, we had to build out the tech stack of a traditional Bay Area tech company. So user management, access control, onboarding, some web component to the product. So it was super fun for me, was just taking all the stuff that I knew at this deeper tech level and all the people that I've worked with for two, three years at that point and bubble up the stack and help create an interface to this thing.
00:03:05.342 - 00:03:55.154, Speaker B: And that kicked off a passion of mine, which is how do you build great consumer experiences around sort of deep or hard tech? And obviously, I'm probably preaching to the choir here about the problems we face in blockchain. So that was super fun. I've always felt very product oriented, and so that reignited the fire for me personally of like, okay, I want to go start a company. I want to build something. Actually started this company, Dialect pre dialect. So left Rigetti computing and actually was building a consumer investing product. So like retail investing, kind of like halfway between robinhood, which is like very kind of like gamified investing, and then like the vanguards of the world, which is just like, you know, not the most exciting thing in the world.
00:03:55.154 - 00:04:16.570, Speaker B: But so I didn't forget it. We did YC on that idea and launched in spring of 2021. Had a really good splash on Hacker News. We literally called it GitHub for investing. So you can probably imagine that that scratched an itch for the hacker news community. So that was super fun. It was great to see the community engagement.
00:04:16.570 - 00:05:05.040, Speaker B: Turns out it's a very hard problem being in the kind of no man's land between touching your money too much and never touching it. As is typically the case with a startup, you go through that kind of like initial excitement. Obviously you didn't get retention, right? Retention is that holy grail of, like, when you finally figure out product market fit. So we were like several months into that summer of 2021 when things for me personally started to pivot towards Solana. And so, rewinding a little bit, where does blockchain fit into any of this? Friend of mine told me about bitcoin in like 2011, and it took a two years or so. Like, it just sounded sort of like pirate money on the Internet, and it took two years or so before I stumbled. He didn't tell me at the time.
00:05:05.040 - 00:05:42.670, Speaker B: I knew he knew it and I was very frustrated he didn't tell me at the time of like, how you actually create trustable consensus with like an ownerless digital cash. So it was like 2013 sometime where I stumbled on the proof of work work idea and it blew my mind. Like, top ten most incredible things I've learned in my entire life had a huge impact on me. Same friend told me about Ethereum in, like, 2015 or 2016. I think they launched in 2016 and been following along with all of that. And for me, it was always a question of, like, this is such incredible technology. It really feels like, on the order of centuries of, like, the things, like, the introduction of, like, centralized banking style.
00:05:42.670 - 00:06:30.656, Speaker B: And so for me, it was a question of when, not if I would end up building in the space. And a lot of that had to do with scalability, cost, and, like, when are we going to actually onboard, like, the first billion users? So I know I'm doing this a little bit anachronistically, but while I was working on that other startup, fall of 2020. So, like, September, October, I listened to a podcast that was with Anatoly and SPFD and had never heard of Solana before. So this was like, summer. It was like September 2020. And Anatoly started talking about Solana in terms of, like, distributed systems and, like, what he had done at Qualcomm and, like, the 3g networks that the telecom companies had stood up. And it just struck me, this is something that, at least for me, came from.
00:06:30.656 - 00:06:56.450, Speaker B: My training in physics is, like, when you can port over these very powerful metaphors and just, like, maps, really. Interestingly. And he was talking about clock synchronization. How do you actually put that in an adversarial, like, trustless environment? It was just, like, up there with bitcoin. Like, bitcoin for proof of work, ethereum for generalized compute, and then Solana for speed and scale. It was just enormously impactful on me. So that was incredible.
00:06:56.450 - 00:07:24.674, Speaker B: Total nerd snipe. And so that was late 2020. By summer of 2021, we're kind of in this grind, trying to improve. So coming back full circle to what I was working on, we were in this grind, trying to improve retention and grow this product that we were working on. And during that time, I'd been obsessively following the Solana ecosystem. I just saw the literal cambrian explosion of just projects building in the space. Just amazing teams, incredibly talented developers.
00:07:24.674 - 00:07:54.922, Speaker B: I was hanging out in the discord, seeing Armani doing cool stuff by, say, August, I was like, every extra week that I'm not building on Solana is a huge missed opportunity. Ended up being very fortunate. We were able to rejigger the whole business and basically just pivot 100% into Solana. And so wrapping the story up basically hacked out. If you remember, the ignition hackathon was going on around that time. We were able to hack out this proof of concept. We knew immediately what we wanted to build.
00:07:54.922 - 00:08:41.530, Speaker B: We knew exactly what we wanted to do with dialect, and so hacked out this proof of concept in a few weeks, couple weeks, got very fortunate, placed in the hackathon. And that to me was like, all right, we're onto something here. There's this amazing missing puzzle piece in web3. Solana is the first blockchain, at least to me personally, where I was like, I want to build here. This is where I want to make this technology come to life. And so then we brought together this strategic round with multicoin and jump crypto, Solana Ventures, all that. And then late fall, early, early, like kind of winter of this year, had a little bit of discovery work on are we developer tooling? Are we nothing? But then ultimately launched early this year with our open source developer tooling, all of that around messaging, notifications.
00:08:41.530 - 00:08:44.870, Speaker B: So that's the story. Maybe I'll pause there.
00:08:45.250 - 00:09:35.636, Speaker A: That's insane. That's awesome. It's a very impressive story. Thank you. I mean, ultimately, I mean, could just pick apart that entire story for the entire conversation. But I think what is super interesting, you're doing the deep technical work in the past, had the kind of startup itch and got into YC, which is impressive in itself, and then kind of was able to keep up enough with the entire blockchain ecosystem and kind of be knowledgeable enough to understand, like, the scalability and that being like a big issue, kind of either stumbling upon or a kind of meant to be with fate, listening to the SDF and. And a totally podcast, and then kind of bring it all together with the hackathon and raising round.
00:09:35.636 - 00:09:36.724, Speaker A: Super impressive.
00:09:36.812 - 00:10:08.096, Speaker B: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think, like, this question of, like, when to building crypto or when to make big pivots, all that, like, at the end of the day, you just have to, like, follow your gut. And we knew a fraction of what we do about the messaging problem back when we got started. And a lot of that was like, there's this phrase, I forget where it comes from, but, like, someone I follow on Twitter said, like, most people think, like, in order to get started, you have to have a good idea. And it's actually the flip side, in order to have a good idea, you have to get started. That's just the shipper's mentality, all that.
00:10:08.096 - 00:10:21.192, Speaker B: So, like, just had a hunch there was a cool problem here. And then when you have just such incredible communicators, like Anatoly, SPF, Kyle Smani, all that, it really was, like, very compelling. It's just like, it's time to build. Let's do it.
00:10:21.336 - 00:10:40.284, Speaker A: That's amazing. I love it. Yeah. So was the YC company, is that like what you pivoted into what is now dialects or Washington? It kind of like, all right, from this YC initiative, we're going to stop and then fully just kind of transition to web3. And building on Solana.
00:10:40.372 - 00:10:53.316, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it was literally like, if 180 degrees is as opposite as you can get, like, pick a higher dimension, whatever. Crazy. It was just complete 180 on the previous technology. Totally unrelated.
00:10:53.428 - 00:10:53.836, Speaker A: Gotcha.
00:10:53.868 - 00:11:08.870, Speaker B: Just nothing. It's actually a different company, had a different name, all that. We actually, like, legally renamed the company and everything. But the only thing that didn't change was we didn't shut it down. So we kept kind of like, we had taken a couple small investments right before around the time we did YC.
00:11:09.650 - 00:11:10.978, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's amazing.
00:11:11.034 - 00:11:13.634, Speaker B: And they've all been incredibly supportive of us, which is great.
00:11:13.802 - 00:11:41.970, Speaker A: Very cool. No, it's a wild story. I think I'm just kind of impressed about how moving from one thing to another, because it's not always easy and there's a lot of ambiguity on, like, the building side, but also in a space that's moving so fast, it's hard to keep up with things. Just even decide what you want to work on. And I think, to your point, I think it's a very good idea. Just decided or to decide to begin. Yes.
00:11:41.970 - 00:11:53.576, Speaker A: And like, even with this podcast, it was like, I don't know who I'm going to talk to, I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm just going to buy the podcast stuff and start talking to people. And it's a. And it's been really fun so far.
00:11:53.648 - 00:12:30.258, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just like, once you, like, actually just start putting 1ft in front of the other, it's amazing what happens. You just like manufacture luck, you manufacture opportunity, all that. And it's like, especially if you want to get to know folks in the ecosystem, like, so we're developer tooling and a lot of our time is talking to projects. We've been very disciplined not to launch a consumer product. And even just like, if you're going to show up and tell someone about what you're doing, like, it's always a fine balance of, you don't want to waste too much time building the wrong thing. But at the same time, like, showing up with nothing to a customer call doesn't go nearly as far. So trusting your instincts and just being like, you know what? Let's just get that first thing out the door and see what happens.
00:12:30.354 - 00:12:48.898, Speaker A: That's amazing. Well, maybe to transition a little bit. I think if you could kind of give the audience like a high level what dialect is and kind of what you're hoping to achieve with the product kind of going forward.
00:12:49.074 - 00:13:02.242, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe the right place to start is with the problem. So, like, I really, I feel like got into crypto with like all of the defi that came online in like 2020, 2021 Defi.
00:13:02.266 - 00:13:03.994, Speaker A: Summer was very cool.
00:13:04.122 - 00:13:54.934, Speaker B: Yeah. And like the kind of shocking thing at the time was, you know, you could go deposit collateral, let's say, in a lending protocol. And so it was like the original motivation behind dialect. And once you close the tab, there's really no way for this project to get in touch with you to let you know. For example, I mean, the original motivation behind notification or messaging in general, let's say notifications as that first use case is like alerts about avoiding bad things, is like the very beginning of communication from like a DAP or a business to a customer is like absolutely important things like imminent. And that just shocked me. And I'll actually say, like, crypto probably like, the thing about crypto that ultimately I was like, this feels like the future, like proof of work, consensus, trustlessness.
00:13:54.934 - 00:14:41.838, Speaker B: All that aside, the thing that really struck me was that like, and this is when I was first playing around with Ethereum a long time ago, is that like every smart contract you call, every function on the blockchain takes an identity as an argument that there's no, like, you never run code without some knowledge of who's running it. And that was just like mind bending. It was incredibly cool. And you see that all the way down to the consumer product where for like the first time in, you know, a decade and a half or longer, there's a new way to sign in on the Internet, which is you connect your wallet. And so that to me it was just like, I've implemented auth a few times in web two products. I'm by no means like an auth expert. And it's just like, you know, no offense to like the massive, massively successful authentication products out there in the world, but like, it's a rough experience.
00:14:41.838 - 00:15:36.972, Speaker B: OAuth is an amazing technology, but it's also just like very, can be difficult for developers. Like every YC batch has like a handful of auth companies that they're just like trying to disrupt that space. But, you know, custody of key pairs aside, connecting a wallet is such an interesting new space and this universal auth that you carry the same key pair between every product you use on a given blockchain. It's actually like a huge design space opportunity that we see. And so it's just like it's inevitable to us that yes, you can enter your email address. And we actually, with dialect all of our developer tooling on the notification side, we support email, sms, telegram as web. Two channels we're running like, well that's maybe a separate story we can come back to, but it's inevitable to us that there needs to be this foundational communication layer between key pairs.
00:15:36.972 - 00:16:26.954, Speaker B: It's going to happen whether it's dialect or somebody else. And so for us, the very sort of no brainer first use cases for dapps to message users. We think that once social takes off, it's going to be enormous and there's going to be some like, yeah, like amazing killer use cases. But the very obvious thing to us when we were getting started is just like the very utility based how do you get in touch with your users? So kind of probably stating the obvious at this point. In the same way when we say notifications and messaging, we really mean like two sides of the same coin. It's the same rails in the same way that a business manages an email address to send alerts, reminders, promotions, like advertising to all of its users. Adapt in web3 and with dialect just has their key pair, whatever key pair they want to use.
00:16:27.082 - 00:17:04.810, Speaker A: That's amazing. No, I totally, totally agree. The single sign on for the entire web with a wallet or a key is insane. It's something that I've been thinking about a lot as well, and just how drastically that changes every interaction that you have pretty much on the Internet going forward. Once kind of that wallet key pair becomes standard, totally makes sense that you should be able to get in contact with your users and vice versa. It's super interesting. That's awesome.
00:17:04.810 - 00:17:38.378, Speaker A: You kind of stated the problem statement, but going a little bit more into like what you're building. I think it's very obvious now that you've kind of outlayed it that the problem exists and going forward it's only going to be exacerbated if it's not addressed sooner or later and now comes in dialect and what you're building maybe kind of go a little bit more into your dialect specifically and kind of like how you kind of plan, plan to address some of these issues.
00:17:38.514 - 00:18:10.632, Speaker B: Yeah, that's great. Yeah. So we, as I mentioned, with this smart messaging protocol, what we do is we enable communication between key pairs so we don't introduce any new identity objects. We're actually like super excited about the identity primitives that are coming online on top of this. But we wanted to operate very unopinionated, at a very low level, kind of a la SMTP and whatnot, to be as interactive, operable as possible. So we are today live audited. We've been on Mainnet for several months, back when we launched in early March.
00:18:10.632 - 00:18:38.980, Speaker B: And we're powering messaging and notifications for over a dozen of like, the biggest dapps and projects on Solana. And what that looks like, very simply to start, is one to one messaging between key pairs. And so this v zero of our protocol enables you to send messages between key pairs. And we can get into kind of like access control in a little bit. But, yeah, go ahead.
00:18:39.280 - 00:18:54.232, Speaker A: No, I was just like, sometimes I try to. Everybody that I talk to is so technical. I just want to make sure everybody else that's following along kind of understands when you're saying key pairs, like, could you explain just what a key pair is for everybody else?
00:18:54.296 - 00:19:35.576, Speaker B: That's right. So this is a great point. By key pair, we very literally mean the wallet that you have. And wallet can be, can mean different things in different contexts. So, like, if you download fandom or slope or software, like that is a wallet app that you're using, whether it's a chrome extension or the mobile app. Ultimately, when you say create a new wallet within that app and you're generated some number of like, basically like a seed phrase, and then given a, like a public key that is your address and how people reach you, that's more what we mean about the key pair. So technically, under the hood behind the seed phrase is some set of key pairs.
00:19:35.576 - 00:20:22.404, Speaker B: This is maybe getting a little too technical, but that address that you carry around with you and that when you connect either to a chrome extension wallet or a mobile wallet that has your funds, all of that stuff, it is kind of like an identity. Um, just obviously focus mostly these days on, you know, money tokens, nfts, all of that. So that's what we mean. That most foundational and very unopinionated sense of identity on the blockchain was like very obvious to us that we just want messaging to basically occur between those. And so basically, anybody on the Solana blockchain who has one of these wallets or key pairs, the moment you generate it through any one of the products that you use in the Solana ecosystem, you're able to message that's awesome. Yeah.
00:20:22.572 - 00:20:36.244, Speaker A: And then I think I sidetracked you, but getting more like maybe into some of the technicals or just how you're able to do some of the messaging on the dialog side between the different key pairs of wallets.
00:20:36.372 - 00:21:12.060, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is a really interesting problem. I mean, I can describe where we are today and wherever actually imminently going, and how we're thinking about the roadmap. So if I understand correctly, the question is sort of like, how are these messages sent and received? So today? And this was what was fun for us. This is our v zero protocol when you initiate messaging. So, Logan, let's say you and I decide to message each other. All of those messages actually exist, encryptable, end to end encryptable signal style on the Solana blockchain in what are called program derived accounts.
00:21:12.720 - 00:21:17.800, Speaker A: And is that native to Solana, or is that kind of universal across all blockchains?
00:21:17.920 - 00:22:01.464, Speaker B: So we are only live on Solana today. We are probably going multi chain relatively soon. The accounts model and how data is stored varies a bit between blockchains. And Solana actually has a relatively unique model. The best way to think about it is any key pair on Solana. Okay, so this takes a little bit of nuance to describe, but any key pair you generate working with, you know, some client wallet. And anytime you generate that public private key pair with the seed phrase, you can initiate data storage on the Solana blockchain affiliated with that account.
00:22:01.464 - 00:22:45.484, Speaker B: And a lot of the actions that you take, such as storing, let's say, native Sol, or getting other SPL tokens and whatnot, ultimately are stored in accounts related to that one. There's this whole other kind of account on the Solana blockchain called a program derived address or a PDA. And that's actually created in a way such that there's no private key corresponding to the public key. It seems like you're fairly familiar with this. What's super fascinating about that is what that means is there's no key and no wallet that any human can really own to sign for the data in that account. And instead, it's derived off of a program that yet again, sits in another account on chain. And so program derived addresses the authority of that is the owning program.
00:22:45.484 - 00:23:36.504, Speaker B: And so that's a really neat way to sort of like, store user data, builds complex programs and dapps and protocols and whatnot. And so the way that dialect works is we derive a PDA that's based a PDA address. Deterministically, that's based on the access control of the participants. This is like a very cool problem space that we're exploring much more deeply than this. But to start, what that means is for one to one wallet to wallet messaging, take the two public keys of the two participants in the thread and sort them alphabetically. And you can deterministically just derive an address for this. Now, another detail about, say, how Solana works is in order to allocate data on the blockchain and store information, you have to deposit what's called rent.
00:23:36.504 - 00:24:18.780, Speaker B: And it's obviously, if data is a scarce resource, there needs to be some kind of financial barrier to using it. So I know this is like 101 Solana, but it's super fun stuff. It was really great to learn. What happens is the person initiating the thread between the two parties deposits this rent. And for anyone not familiar, rent is a little bit, can be a bit of a misleading term. What it simply means is you deposit native Sol to this account address, and as long as it's there, the amount of solid you've deposited determines how much space you have to store data. And so for a few bucks, you can get enough space for a lot of messages.
00:24:18.780 - 00:25:13.784, Speaker B: And then what we do is then the creator of the thread, we call them dialects, chooses the scopes and privileges of the two users, which right now is very simple. It's just, do I have write access and do have admin access? And anyone who has write access can now post messages to this thread. And we wanted to keep the cost and kind of the barrier to messaging as low as possible. And so, obviously, a few dollars of rent is not nothing. And we actually have some very exciting plans in our roadmap that are coming online soon. But assuming a user is willing to do that, what we end up doing is very densely just pack the messages in what we call a byte buffer ring inside of this fixed amount of space. And so, very much like Snapchat and a bunch of these other social that have come online in the last few years, the ephemeral nature of your messaging actually is a feature, not a bug.
00:25:13.784 - 00:25:19.920, Speaker B: And so to keep the architecture simple, as you fill up this PDA, you end up just overwriting old messages with new ones.
00:25:20.000 - 00:25:20.536, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:25:20.608 - 00:25:49.170, Speaker B: So, from both a notifications and a chat perspective in general, things are relatively, relatively kind of ephemeral already, whether web two or web3. And we just decided for keeping our architecture super simple. That's how we chose to design it. One last point on this is there's actually, like, very compelling arguments of why you wouldn't want to store this kind of data on the Solana blockchain. These like, simple heuristics about, like, what kind of data actually belong in accounts on chain user consumable messages.
00:25:49.250 - 00:25:53.430, Speaker A: Just like, don't really like SMS or text messages.
00:25:53.510 - 00:26:26.536, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just not really like, why you would want to store data on the blockchain. And like, Kyle Smani has a really great way to talk about how to think about data on, like, an l one. Like, Solana is like, it's about scarcity. It's about managing finite resources and tracking a ledger of their movement between individuals. The kind of abundant style data that's just, you know, social users messing with each other is not really the intended use case. The reason we chose to do this first was because it was able to be built relatively quickly. It was a small architectural footprint.
00:26:26.536 - 00:27:11.018, Speaker B: But then the really fun part was just to like, show that it's possible. Like, here's this incredible new blockchain with like, ballistically fast transaction times and block times and just like, vanishingly small costs that a transaction on the Solana blockchain right now I think, is under or a 40th or a 50th of a penny if you think about it. Like, sending a text programmatically with Twilio is on the order of ascent. So we're talking well over an order of magnitude lower in cost. These are not apple. This is not a fair comparison, but a lot of people talk about dialect as Twilio for web3. And so just thinking of it that way, when a small startup chooses to have the users enter phone numbers and then they start texting them, that's a significantly higher cost than using this long blockchain right now.
00:27:11.154 - 00:27:26.554, Speaker A: So it is pretty amazing. Yeah, no, I love the design and kind of keeping it as simplistic as possible and then also just kind of shipping the MVP as fast as possible to get it out to users, kind of share the proof of concept, and.
00:27:26.562 - 00:27:58.970, Speaker B: Then it also was just a great conversation starter in the community. Like, we've seen a lot of really cool messaging come online, kind of separate things. Usually products launch as messaging or launch as notifications. And obviously on Ethereum, you're going to store that data off chain somewhere. And the sophistication of these projects is obviously increasing. But for a lot of them, it was just sort of like storing the messages in a firebase DB, which there, like, there's a very clear. It's very easy to argue that these messages should not be on, say, ethereum or Solana.
00:27:58.970 - 00:28:29.640, Speaker B: And this is a whole separate question of sort of like, our vision for web3 and whatnot, of, like, where we think these should be stored. But it was just great to get to know the Solana community, introduce ourselves as this, like, fully on chain messaging protocol. And it's just been super fun since then. Now that, like, more and more projects are coming online and we're like, getting into the user experience and getting into the economics for both users and dapps, we're initiating and quite far along in a much more exciting roadmap for where we're taking things.
00:28:29.680 - 00:29:07.210, Speaker A: So that's amazing. Yeah, it really is. And on the Solana point, like, how cheap it is, it was interesting. Like, during DeFi summer, I was super excited and I was trying to get my friends to use, like, uniswap or aave or comp, but none of them really cared. And then once NFT started happening, Eth was too expensive for them to use, so they don't want to use Eth. And it wasn't until Solana and Solana nfts started popping off that they're like, oh, like, I kind of get this blockchain stuff. It's super interesting and it's cheap, so it's cool just to see, like the progression of blockchains more holistically.
00:29:07.210 - 00:29:20.002, Speaker A: But also just as blockchains become cheaper, what type of applications? From one, the developer standpoint and the user standpoint point that they enable once you kind of hit scale 100%.
00:29:20.106 - 00:29:20.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:20.770 - 00:29:22.386, Speaker A: So, no, it's super cool.
00:29:22.458 - 00:30:49.090, Speaker B: And to your point on nfts, obviously this has been going now for a while, and it's been amazing to see as this really terrific first consumer use case, it challenged a lot of our assumptions, because when we were first building, we were looking at DeFi, and we're saying, if you've got a few hundred k and in some collateralized loan on solid or jet or tulip or something like that, depositing a few bucks is like not that big of a deal, but the kind of like, once you get into the social of NFTs and all that, it just opens up to a whole new consumer base and a whole new psychology of what you're doing and a whole different way of thinking about the economics of the decisions you're making. And so one of the. And so philosophically for us, it's always been like, sure, we can get started with that, but we have to obsessively go toward free. And a big piece of what excites us about Solana is like, for all the time that we've been following anatoly and like, you know, he, he's very active and present great communicator. One of the things, one of my favorite things that he says, like, we always have to make it faster and cheaper, just obsessively making it faster and cheaper, because there's really no thing on the Internet you want to do slowly and expensively. And so just that kind of obsession. Obviously, these are very challenging design trade offs, and we're, like, broadly very excited about what's being developed in the broader web3 community.
00:30:49.090 - 00:31:00.142, Speaker B: But this kind of, like, what does the future of the Internet look like? I think if you're just obsessively aiming for low cost and high speed, it's just, it's, it's just, it's a fantastic motivator.
00:31:00.246 - 00:31:11.790, Speaker A: I fully agree. Yeah, yeah. Hopefully we can get totally on the podcast soon. I would really love to talk to him about Solana. It'd be a fun conversation. But. No, I totally agree.
00:31:11.790 - 00:31:55.172, Speaker A: I mean, in this. Yeah, I think me and, like, my product background, like, I've kind of been more obsessed on, like, the user side. And so I started, like, looking at, like, doing analytics nascent and kind of seeing, like, what are the users doing? And then once I kind of found out, like, the most popular dapps on ETH, like, I think uniswap on the l one had like four or 5 million, like, wallets ever interact with the contract. And then Opensea was like, between like one and 3 million per se. But then I've been, like, getting more into the weeds on the salon side. And I think for the last month or so, Nason was saying that they have, like, 18 million monthly active users on, like, the wallet side.
00:31:55.276 - 00:31:55.868, Speaker B: That's incredible.
00:31:55.924 - 00:32:18.640, Speaker A: And I think that's very much attributed to just the lower costs or hopefully kind of over time trending to almost free. But yeah, I'm super excited for people to actually use the applications, whether it's an NFT or builders such as yourself building applications that allow kind of a more web two, like experience.
00:32:18.760 - 00:32:19.264, Speaker B: That's right.
00:32:19.312 - 00:32:42.904, Speaker A: But with the ability of kind of the properties of what the blockchain provides. So I'm super excited about the future. Maybe kind of like jumping off on that point. Can you tell us a little bit more about, like, the applications or the engineers or the products that are using dialect and kind of how that integration has been going?
00:32:43.072 - 00:33:19.314, Speaker B: Yeah. And maybe this is a good kickoff point to just briefly mentioning, like, what are the starting, let's say, with DAP notifications so we're, as I mentioned, we're powering notifications now for over a dozen of some of the more loved dapps in the Solana ecosystem. And this is across, we like to talk about like big verticals, like NFTs, defi Daos. And so on the NFT side we're powering notifications for or Olaplex and Bridge split. And Bridge split is one of those amazing projects that's kind of like bridging the divide, I guess. It's literally in their name between DeFi and NFTs. They're wonderful.
00:33:19.314 - 00:33:56.752, Speaker B: They were the first project that we went live with. And then on the Dao side, we're powering notifications for the squads app. That's just been a wonderful team to work with and also realms and then on the defi side, powering for a ton of different projects. Obviously there's so many different flavors of Defi. So we're, we're powering sabre on sort of like structured products. We're doing, we're powering notifications for friction in Katana tulip zero one. Just.
00:33:56.752 - 00:34:34.876, Speaker B: Yeah, so, but then where we started, as I mentioned, so we went live with a bunch of Defi projects to start. That obvious initial thing of like. And I mentioned the liquidation risk. That's a great place to start. What's amazing is like, and this comes back to like, as you mentioned, being product driven and also being customer driven. For us, part of what has been fun about building dialect is getting to interact with and engage closely with bunch of the projects within the ecosystem. And so we actually just roll up our sleeves and help build these integrations out for folks.
00:34:34.876 - 00:35:11.531, Speaker B: And by doing that we get a chance to both dog food our own tooling. So as I mentioned, we're fully open source. Anybody can really integrate us, but we just, it allows us to improve our developer tooling. And it's also like messaging and notifications is really just, it is a hair on the fire problem, but it's not necessarily one of these key differentiators. Like if you're building some complex structured product offering, you need to be innovating in that space. And so it's never quite a p one for the projects that we're working with. And so for us it's that do things that don't scale that YC mantra like just dive in and help out.
00:35:11.531 - 00:35:54.920, Speaker B: That's been really helpful for us. But then the main point I was coming back to, which is about use cases, is starting with these kinds of like if you don't do a thing, a bad thing will happen. So, like liquidations or similar, what we found sooner rather than we expected is actually what most projects are interested in is less on the alerting side and more on the engagement and retention. And it's kind of like inevitable once you realize it, that, like, what's actually one of the key missing things in web3 is not so much that you need to come back to fix a crisis, although that's like, very important. I don't know if you saw Saaland was tweeting out like, hey, FYI, and they were like, flagging a wallet. That's not the first time that that's happened.
00:35:54.960 - 00:36:04.496, Speaker A: It's like $160 million or something. Someone very much trusts Soland and hopefully did not take out too much money. I hope they pay back.
00:36:04.608 - 00:36:34.730, Speaker B: And it's like that kind of stuff. I mean, we were hearing about it with maker back in. I think it was like 2020. There was just some like, giga whale that was just like sitting there and people were like, how do we get in touch with these folks? So, like, to the end of the earth, like, we're going to solve. We love this problem. But what's been so much fun is, like, especially on, like, leaning more consumer and social with what's coming online with nfts, engagement and retention. We're just hearing this over and over and over that I would actually say still kind of on the alerting side.
00:36:34.730 - 00:37:27.730, Speaker B: This idea that like, okay, okay, you just got an offer on your NFT or you just got outbid on an NFT that is kind of on the alerting side. And it is one of these things where, like, how on earth does that not exist yet? But what's been really fun for us, and it's helped shape our thesis here, is just across the board, one of the things that now as a tool at these, you know, disposal, these dapps, is how do we reach our users and how do we help them know what we're doing, send product updates, help them know about, you know, new features or big events that are happening. Obviously, you've got the discords and the twitters of the world. And, like, do not misunderstand us. Like, those products are excellent and have really deep product market fit. And so it's not our intention to try to, like, directly compete. But if you think about the fidelity of a channel for hearing from a given product, like, my discord, the discords that I'm in, my, like, app itself, it's, it's very hard for me to get product updates there.
00:37:27.730 - 00:38:45.078, Speaker B: So it's this really powerful tool that's now, you know, usable by these projects to communicate with their, with their products. So we're actually like building out a fair amount of tooling around this like announcement style and engagement and retention side. And so yeah, just like powering a bunch of use cases for a bunch of these projects. One really exciting thing, and this is, this whole flip side of the problem is, okay, great, so you've got this messaging protocol and you can message between key pairs. How on earth do you even get these messages right? Like where do they, how do you solve the deliverability problem? And this is why we care about messaging as sort of like the superset of the notifications problem alongside building out plug and play tooling for notifications. So, and to be very concrete about like what is actually live to. So maybe pausing for a second on the deliverability problem with any one of these dapps that we're powering, what you'll find is just like the best web two products that you've used, right in the navbar, there's a little notification bell and you can tap that and you have a fully self service experience of opting in to receive notifications via 1 hour protocol, which we just say to your wallethood.
00:38:45.078 - 00:39:16.948, Speaker B: But also, as I mentioned earlier, email, Telegram, SMS, those are very popular and really effective. And actually it is kind of a magic moment to get an email from a Dex. It's cool. It's been a lot of fun. It was great to see that come online. But once you've enabled wallet, you actually can see these messages like receipt style in the app itself. This is a lighter form, deliverability, in that you're not going to like get a notification on your phone, but when you're at the site and be like.
00:39:16.964 - 00:39:17.652, Speaker A: What'S been going on?
00:39:17.676 - 00:40:02.590, Speaker B: And that's like a very familiar pattern from the best web two products, such as a sense of activity, things that happened while you were there or while you weren't. What's fun about Web three? And this gets into the first little piece of like why web3 and not web two? And so we have this term we're having fun with, which we call smart messaging. And the first part of smart messaging is this concept of the decentralized inbox. And so while the messages are showing up right there in this single modal on adapt site, you can also receive them to inbox tooling that we've built out both web and mobile. And so one great example is we are powering a full inbox experience on the step finance site. So I don't know about you, I'm just like a huge fan of step finance. Great team.
00:40:02.590 - 00:40:51.620, Speaker B: It's like the original product I started using for understanding all my positions in Defi. Across Solana, there's now an inbox section where you can, like, basically get a full sort of inbox sounds, email. And I know I say SMTP, but obviously you want a better user experience than that. So for us, we think of, like, Telegram and familiar products as like, the better messaging experience. So it's very telegram, like, almost like a desktop version of Telegram, where you have the list of all the threads you're hearing from, including basically the Dapps that are sending you notifications and also users, and you have like a full messaging experience there. So getting back to this, like, deliverability problem, that's a great experience. And it feels like a super, kind of like natural fit for a product like step where you can just have a, have a full picture into everything that's going on.
00:40:51.620 - 00:41:42.930, Speaker B: Where we feel like deliverability takes a, a huge leap forward is mobile. And so obviously in the last five months, basically, like, since the beginning of 2022, there's been this wave of new mobile apps coming online. The vast majority of them are mobile wallets. And that is this just really critical place where not only is it true that users in general, web two or web3 don't want to download a bunch of different apps, it's like app fatigue. Like, do I need another app for this, all that. But then also specifically in web3, the mobile experience doesn't quite have the same chrome extension signing experience that Web has. The best mobile apps right now in web3 are apps that actually have access to your key pair.
00:41:42.930 - 00:42:33.436, Speaker B: And from a security perspective, it's good to minimize that. First and foremost are this new category of really high polish mobile apps that have come online, and I'm thinking about solflare, Slope, Phantom, all these just really incredible. And then glow as well. Just like amazing mobile experiences that are really, and this is just salon. There's just been a huge explosion across web3 in general of this new consumer experience. All of which is basically to say this is a very natural candidate for deliverability of messages. I want to hear, I want like an unopinionated, unbiased, direct to my wallet messaging inbox experience that is going to deliver push notifications right on the lock screen of my phone so that I hear about it right when it happens and when I need to know about it.
00:42:33.436 - 00:42:46.558, Speaker B: And so we're very excited to announce that we've been working with some, some mobile wallets and we've just announced that we're launching an inbox experience in SLO. I don't actually know when this podcast is published, but it's going live on June 27.
00:42:46.614 - 00:42:48.590, Speaker A: Excellent. Yeah, congratulations.
00:42:48.710 - 00:43:40.270, Speaker B: And for us, and just kind of take this very long story about deliverability full circle. We have been very disciplined about making sure that we are low level developer tooling. Obviously, time to success matters to us, but we are not our own consumer product because we want to be this messaging layer across all of Solana and then eventually more broadly across web3. And to do that, you really have to act like a neutral platform and a neutral technology. And so this decentralized inbox concept that we're building toward and working with all these partners on is that you might have Phantom and let's say I've got slope and then our other buddy's got glow and solflare and we can actually message with each other. If you think about like what web one promised, you could have a gmail address, I could have an outlook address, someone else got a hotmail, and we can actually message each other. And that's pretty crazy.
00:43:40.270 - 00:44:10.820, Speaker B: Like, that's kind of amazing. And while there have been like attempts on and off in like the web two world, because we like think of SMTP as Web one, even though it's a little blurry, we just, that siloed authentication coming back to this universal off point has made that extremely challenging in Web two. And we think we have a shot at delivering a really kind of interoperable messaging experience in Web three. So that is very much our vision with dialect. And obviously going live with a mobile messaging experience is a big step for us.
00:44:10.860 - 00:44:11.692, Speaker A: That's amazing about it.
00:44:11.716 - 00:44:12.012, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:44:12.036 - 00:44:35.530, Speaker A: Yeah, it really is. I love kind of the approach from the global messaging side instead of trying to build out the full stack yourself. And it is kind of comical just looking back on like history. I mean, I think we know where early when the vast majority of people are kind of interact with these smart contracts through a browser. That's right, that's right.
00:44:37.150 - 00:44:41.526, Speaker B: Whereas like browser majority of consumer is mobile. Yeah, that's absolutely right.
00:44:41.678 - 00:45:31.318, Speaker A: I mean, it seems fairly obvious. I mean, a lot of people now, like, they don't either just have like not an iPad but some type of tablet, like just smartphone. And I'm not very, I mean, I've seen less, more people, I mean, obviously their day to day interaction with the computer, the Internet is the smartphone. And so it seems like the obvious place that a lot of this technology is going to shift to and kind of be more mobile centric as it continues to progress in scale. And then adding that messaging component, one for the urgent notification like liquidations, but also kind of more around that social aspect. And just general messaging is going to blossom just hardcore. So it seems like you're excited about it, you're in a very good spot kind of holistically, as I would say.
00:45:31.318 - 00:45:37.886, Speaker A: The space continues to grow by ten or 100 x, but then even the messaging is going to grow much, much more.
00:45:37.918 - 00:46:29.194, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's a really exciting space. It's just this very foundational primitive and like, we genuinely believe this decentralized inbox being one piece of this smart messaging picture. But there are say three or four different things that we think are going to be really big for like eventually the dream here. And this is very much with dialogue. Coming back to your point about being product driven, and as I was saying at the beginning, like wanting to build consumer experiences around harder tech, we feel very strongly that there are aspects of blockchains and of web3 that are going to make messaging more delightful and more interesting in a way where a consumer may say, I don't care what's under the hood, this is just something I can't do an imessage or let's say WhatsApp or whichever, and that's just cool and I want to use it. And that's our thesis.
00:46:29.322 - 00:46:34.696, Speaker A: I fully agree. And I think ultimately blockchains will be the same way where it's just one.
00:46:34.728 - 00:46:36.296, Speaker B: Small chunk of that bigger pie.
00:46:36.368 - 00:46:56.168, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, ultimately I think, like even going back to like SMTP or like IP addresses, like, people ultimately really don't know any of this. Like, you know, like I have an email address and it maps to something and. But ultimately I don't care. I just want my email to go to you. Like if I type in apple.com comma, it maps to an IP address.
00:46:56.168 - 00:47:19.170, Speaker A: But we're so early that a lot of this hasn't been observed from the engineers yet. But people like you and your team are coming in and making those applications just much easier to use for everybody. So I'm excited not only for dialect, but as more engineers and builders come into the space for a lot of those complexities to continue to be abstracted so more people can come into web3 more broadly.
00:47:19.250 - 00:48:04.250, Speaker B: That's right. And actually on your point about making things more accessible, one thing we've been disciplined not to work on because there are these incredible other projects working on it is the identity piece. And so this base 58 public key is unreadable and untypeable. So that is a really bad experience of, like, if you and I want to message each other, it's just like, we'd have to basically message this thing on some other thing before we message each other other. There's other cool things you can do with, like, QR codes and all that. But the cool thing is, like, there's some really neat primitives coming online with identity. So obviously there's the OG, like, Solana name service that Bonfida is that they host.
00:48:04.250 - 00:48:07.130, Speaker B: So you can get, like, I don't know if you own Logan Sol.
00:48:07.170 - 00:48:11.602, Speaker A: I have Logan Sol. I'm so happy about it. How to snipe it.
00:48:11.706 - 00:48:29.436, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I got brutally outbid on Chris Sol, which is, like, tragic. I have no idea who owns it. So I, like, have the Christopher Salt, like, my consolation prize. But the really fun thing coming back to what you're saying, like, blockchain, not just messaging, there's just, like, really cool things you can do. So there's that. There's also, I don't know if you've heard of Cardinal.
00:48:29.436 - 00:49:15.914, Speaker B: They do a lot of really, their core thing is, like, NFT rentals, which is, like, such a cool problem space. Like, you should totally talk to them if you haven't. But they have the cardinal Twitter integration, and that's basically, you can cryptographically verify that you own a Twitter handle, and obviously it's affiliated with a key pair. So today, our tooling, we, as I said, we are just messaging between key pairs, but we offer sort of like, plug and play identity where an inbox or some messaging experience wants to inject Solana name service names or Twitter or both with fallbacks. And so you get this really nice messaging experience where you're interacting. You can, like, not only initiate messages, but, like, you can see sending and receiving. And we expect a ton of other identity standards to come online.
00:49:15.914 - 00:49:21.130, Speaker B: There's some very, very, very cool stuff happening in that space, and our goal is just to make sure that we're compatible with all of it.
00:49:21.170 - 00:49:21.530, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:49:21.570 - 00:49:27.226, Speaker B: So global, shared state, universal Auth, all of that. It's just like, unlocking some very cool stuff in that problem space.
00:49:27.338 - 00:50:18.646, Speaker A: That's amazing. Yeah, I'm super excited. I have to just remind myself, like, how early we are in a lot of this. It is kind of wild, but I'm excited that, I mean, we are kind of at the ground floor. Excited that you are building dialect and helping move the entire space forward because I really do think like once you get say 100 million people or a billion people with private keys, what happens? I think social kind of got popular when like the Internet hit around like 500 to 700 million users. And so I know a lot of people like hold crypto, but I don't think that many people like are doing like, like I call them like unique signers, like people like signing transactions on.
00:50:18.678 - 00:50:21.982, Speaker B: Chain and it's, you have like monthly active users.
00:50:22.046 - 00:50:49.894, Speaker A: Exactly. And so as all these pieces kind of come together, it's just going to be super interesting to watch, watch this entire space unfold. But it's very cool. Maybe transitioning a little bit from dialect, or not dialect specifically, but talking maybe more in depth on some of the tooling you built out. On the developer side, you said you were helping doing a lot of the integration.
00:50:49.942 - 00:50:50.782, Speaker B: That's right.
00:50:50.966 - 00:51:01.494, Speaker A: But maybe if you could go a little bit more in depth into what you're building or like how developers, if they wanted to build with dialect, how they would go about doing so.
00:51:01.662 - 00:51:36.576, Speaker B: Yeah, and actually I'm going to contradict myself on something I said earlier where we want to remain very low level and unopinionated. The reality is with any early stage startup, you have to pick up additional responsibilities and build things that you might not necessarily build in a more mature industry. So for example, as I mentioned, we have the wallet to all the messaging protocol. We built that with anchor. And so that generates through this IDL like a typescript SDK. We have a very lightweight API on top of that just to clean things up a little bit. Very few projects use that.
00:51:36.576 - 00:52:35.420, Speaker B: What they use are two other pieces, one of which is inevitable for messaging or notifications. The other is very specific to notifications. This first piece is we built out a very mature and very flexible and customizable react component library for web. And so coming back to this question, so being product oriented, one of the things we care about is our time to success being very fast or being very low. And so whether it's us building it, whether it's the partner project that we're helping car notifications for building it, we want it to be as simple as dropping a single react component into a front end. And so we have owned a, a lot of this space specific to onboarding, to a messaging experience, or even having a full out of the box, full page responsive inbox experience. And so we built a ton of code and written a ton of code and built a ton of tooling around the actual messaging front end together with an injectable styles API.
00:52:35.420 - 00:53:26.456, Speaker B: So for example, I don't know if you're an active squads user, but they have one, one of the coolest designs of like any Dapp that I use. It's like very unique to them. I think they get a lot of good credit for that. And we are able to actually drop in the same like see yarn or NPM, whatever you like, install your dependencies with you install dialect, you drop the single component in, they're just using that, but then they inject these very custom styles. And like I would like to believe that when you're using the squad site, you would not be able to tell that it's dialect stooling. So that's part one, it's this, whether it's messaging inbox experience or it's the notification specific experience, which is like a subset of it, we really want things to just be as fast to implement as possible. Part two, and this is where things actually get really exciting.
00:53:26.456 - 00:54:27.212, Speaker B: This is like whole orthogonal part of our infrastructure and our technology and our problem space. If we believe that notifications is this really key part of broader messaging and is going to be a huge part of beachhead broad adoption of basically, how do we sneak messaging into the web3 world. What that means is for adapt to send a notification about, let's say a liquidation or an NFT buyout offer or any of those things, there needs to be some programmatic sending of a message. And so I didn't mention this before, but a very big part of our code footprint is actually what we call our monitor tooling. And so this is again open source. It's a library you can embed into any JavaScript or typescript environment to do some very efficient, given an arbitrary data source, run some transformations that are very event driven. It's like a catalog of like low code is probably too strong a term because still you're writing code.
00:54:27.212 - 00:55:20.060, Speaker B: But it's a very opinionated way of us saying like inject arbitrary data, run a catalog of things, and then pipe out two messages at the output. The messages are literally any channels that we support. So it's, we write this in kind of a fluent and reactive way. So it's like a dot pole if you're polling for data, or push if you're receiving webhooks, you have this functional thing where you pull data and then you've got some transformations of looking for. If I'm looking, this is getting very much in the weeds, but if I'm looking at, let's say dao proposals on realms, say Mangodao or something, we pull this array of proposals and when a new one appears, it's a new entry in an array. And one of the catalogs we have is dot added. And that would just say basically now I have a new element in an array.
00:55:20.060 - 00:55:58.598, Speaker B: Find out who needs to hear about this. And then that would be dialect, email, telegram, sms. It's just like super clean, super succinct and a lot of abstraction under the hood. Another one, like I mentioned before, is obviously like around. So I mentioned like dot added, there's obviously removed or docked if on arrays. There's also like dot threshold on rising and falling edges on a continuous value. So if you're monitoring an obligation account from Solend or, you know, jet or similar, there's a lot of tooling around these kinds of like large movements.
00:55:58.598 - 00:56:27.140, Speaker B: If something moves very suddenly, we actually power a saber wars bot. We're like big fans of saber wars and a lot of the gauge voting and whatnot. We've been powering this thing for a couple of months now and it just detects large movements and it'll whale alert. It'll be like, oh, there's someone just. And this actually tweets. This is like, it's this little bot that we run. So it's all a very reactive, fluent style of writing code that's a library you can import into any environment.
00:56:27.140 - 00:57:24.934, Speaker B: But then we also, again, sort of like projects are not thinking about this. And a lot of dapps, their whole back end is on chain. And so the other piece of this is we have what we call the monitoring service, which is our opinionated way about how to run the monitor tooling. And this gets back to like kind of open source software business models of, in general, provide your tooling to folks, make it open so that the community can contribute and they can assess and like you can, you know, help, help build a community around a tooling in a standard. But ultimately a lot of folks just ask us to host it for them. So we have these monitoring services running for every one of these DApps to trigger programmatic notifications. So all of which is basically to say these two pieces that most when you want to build with dialect and let's say you're a DAP that wants to manage messaging and let's just say programmatic notifications, you have tooling that allows your users to seamlessly onboard right in your DAP, which is react component libraries.
00:57:24.934 - 00:57:53.622, Speaker B: And then you've got this notifications monitoring service that you kind of configure specific to what things do you want to send notifications about to your users? So those are the two pieces. Both consume the messaging protocol under the hood in that they're either reading messages or they're sending messages. Then obviously with like all the inbox and messaging tooling, that's more like user to user and notifications, that kind of like full inbox experience. Obviously, that's talking directly to the protocol.
00:57:53.726 - 00:58:17.482, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah, I think, yeah, I mean, it is hard. I think ultimately being able to build out all those necessary components and keeping it open source is definitely the right move. Give as much flexibility, but also being able to handhold and onboarding as many people as possible while people kind of figure out the best way that they would like to use it.
00:58:17.506 - 00:58:41.474, Speaker B: So. That's right. And I think the dream here, if you just look at like the web, two businesses that kind of fall under the footprint of the stuff we just talked about, it's like a lot of really, really, really big businesses. So what we would love to see is long term, we're able to just sort of like offload that stuff. Maybe someone forks our tooling and runs with it. Another big piece of what we've been hearing from daps coming back to this engagement and retention. The monitoring service just sends programmatic messages.
00:58:41.474 - 00:59:29.410, Speaker B: There's been a lot of demand for dashboarding that allows you to engage with your community, send announcements and product updates, reminders, all that stuff, maybe even customer support. And it may end up being that some of that needs to be built out. However, we're already seeing some very, very new and very cool projects coming online. I don't actually know if they are okay being talked about publicly just yet, so maybe I won't name any names, but they are exactly what we want to see, where they're building some very sophisticated tooling around. How do, for example, NFT creators who, let's say, have launched a PFP project, how do they engage with their community? And they've come to us saying, like, how do we reach people at their wallets? And that's what we really want to see is people building on top of this.
00:59:30.110 - 00:59:59.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm super excited for it all. Again, congratulations. I think. I mean, just the entire journey from YC to, I mean, your background in your PhD to learning about web3 to identifying a specific use case that's very broad, that will ultimately be used across pretty much every app and kind of building that out at the beginning and kind of scaling that is, it's just impressive. So thank you.
00:59:59.754 - 01:00:08.804, Speaker B: It's been quite a journey. Team is fantastic. It's probably the most fun that I've had like basically in my professional life so far.
01:00:08.852 - 01:00:28.470, Speaker A: So that's awesome. It's good to have fun. No, we've covered a lot. Kind of like your background dialect, the differences between messaging kind of touched upon smart messaging, the developer tools. Is there anything specific that you want to cover that we haven't talked about?
01:00:28.630 - 01:01:17.800, Speaker B: There's maybe just one thing I would mention, which is on the smart messaging side. So talked a lot about kind of like past and present. Where are we today? Coming back to this question of like, why would users want a message in web3 and not web two? The original exciting thing that got us really excited about why web3 coming back to Universal Auth is you think about one of the best things that's happened to messaging in web two over the last ten years. For me personally, a big part of that is the link preview. So you have this, send someone a URL and here's this beautiful rendering. Obviously, it depends on the owner of the URL to make a good link preview. You have entire businesses, no code web things, where a whole part of it is actually crafting your link preview.
01:01:17.800 - 01:02:05.912, Speaker B: And that's always like, it's just a nice part of modern messaging with universal Auth, the fact that you carry your key pair everywhere with you, you have a unique opportunity to take that to a new level and actually make messages interactive. So what we're launching very soon, and we've been talking about this for a few months, is a kind of interactive message standard where, let's say, coming again back to the original use case your wrist, there's actually a quick deposit button right on the message and you just tap it, sign, and you're done. Yeah, so it's super fun. We're really excited about it. We think this is just like a fantastic new unlock in the ecosystem. It's also the timing is right. Obviously, you think of tons and tons of other use cases like accept, offer and sell and NFT, or any of these other things.
01:02:05.912 - 01:03:01.534, Speaker B: Venmo literally becomes a feature, not a product. And I mentioned the Venmo example, because when I say the timing is right, there's just such incredible stuff happening in web3 right now around consumer experience. And for us, Solana Pay was one of the most inspiring events. And so we've had a lot of fun engaging with that team and talking about, there's very, very, very close overlaps between the Solana pay standard and what we're working on with smart messaging. We've been working very closely with the team to come up with as little like basically as least extra work we can to create a smart message standard that piggybacks off of Solana Pay. Because again, coming back to this question of standards, ultimately for deep interoperability and like deep composability, rallying as a community around standards is really, really, really essential. And so that's been a joy for us.
01:03:01.534 - 01:04:12.230, Speaker B: Not only is this is like a cool thing to build and it's just going to be amazing to see what people build with it, but also an opportunity to engage with some of the really talented folks in the ecosystem on these standard problems. So like part two of our, so like part one was the decentralized inbox, part two is smart messaging and there's all these other cool things and maybe we just, we don't have to get into them, but around generalized access control and like how you take the concept of global shared state and global addressing. So we've got some very cool stuff in the works there working with some cool teams that have got some really amazing tech around access control. And then the last piece I would mention just very briefly is we think about like what's one of the worst things about messaging in web two? Like worst thing about my email, I don't know about yours, is how much of it I get and how much of it I really didn't ask for. And so obviously this is like a no brainer that in web3, with inherent financialization, tuning a market where cold inbound has some financial. So mutual opt in always should be free messaging. We just, messaging should always be free.
01:04:12.230 - 01:04:36.014, Speaker B: But creating a kind of financial barrier or market around cold inbound is also on our road, we think has the opportunity to really dramatically improve the messaging experience overall for the end user, especially if that value accrual is toward the end user primarily. And so that's what's on the radar for us. That's what we're really excited about. That's what's going on over the next few months.
01:04:36.062 - 01:05:03.964, Speaker A: That's right, yeah, super exciting. I'm definitely looking forward to everything you're building. I think you've kind of articulated the problem and the problem space beautifully and uh, you're marching in the correct direction and got a lot of uh, strong support from not only some strong investors, but uh, uh, the community. And you guys are killing it. So I'm looking forward to uh, watching you guys keep going. It's very cool. Thank you, Logan.
01:05:04.012 - 01:05:04.604, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
01:05:04.652 - 01:05:17.764, Speaker A: Um, so maybe just to wrap it up. Uh, you touched upon, uh, kind of what you've been working on recently. And you have an upcoming launch date. I think it was June 27.
01:05:17.852 - 01:05:18.660, Speaker B: That's right.
01:05:18.820 - 01:05:22.356, Speaker A: Could you touch upon that and then we can just wrap it up there?
01:05:22.508 - 01:05:53.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Just been working with the slope team for a few months now and they are incredible design partners. They've really, as I mentioned, we build for a lot of projects. The slope team just leaned in and they've just read our documentation. They had all kinds of interesting design questions around messaging protocol. They did their diligence too, like really very thoughtfully. And we're especially excited about them because they, from our very first calls with them, they asked the question that we care the most about.
01:05:53.900 - 01:06:29.530, Speaker B: They said we could build this in house or we could interact with and use something that we think the community can rally around. And just thinking about it that way in the first place is recognizing that, like, this is a very exciting opportunity we have with Web three to create a kind of interoperable and composable. Like, if that's the promise of Web three, we don't do that, it's just going to end up being like Web two with tokens. So just incredibly mature team, very thoughtful about the problem space. And then they've just been extremely supportive of us. It's been a delight to work with them. So that first version of messaging and notifications can be coming online.
01:06:29.530 - 01:07:08.978, Speaker B: And then obviously that's just the beginning. We want to work with them as we enhance our tooling and expand our protocol and whatnot. Where we think of them as very close design partners. We've got some other very cool stuff in works that maybe can't talk about just yet on sort of like the wallet side and whether it's across messaging, notifications, just sort of like future infrastructure of like, as I was saying at the beginning, where do we store these messages? What's our long term plan? Just great things in the works. Working with some amazing teams. And like I said, all the way at the beginning, at the end of the day, the fun part of this is this lawn community. It's just like amazing developers, super talented.
01:07:08.978 - 01:07:12.794, Speaker B: A lot of folks are in it for the right reasons and trying to build the. So awesome.
01:07:12.842 - 01:07:15.114, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll wrap it up there. Thank you so much, Chris.
01:07:15.162 - 01:07:15.810, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you, Logan.
01:07:15.850 - 01:07:17.250, Speaker A: I really appreciate it. It was a great conversation.
