00:00:00.280 - 00:00:26.609, Speaker A: This cycle is universally agreed upon that it's the most difficult cycle for liquid fund managers, liquid investors, since 2017. The reason being last cycle, you only have to get the beta call right, which is directionally long. Crypto was already the contrarian bet. Nobody was long crypto. Nobody knew what crypto was. This is before DeFi, before NFTs, before metaverses. So as long as you called the cycle right, you can buy almost whatever asset you probably pull, multiples.
00:00:26.609 - 00:00:54.625, Speaker A: This cycle is very different in that the world is already fully aware of what crypto is. In fact, they've seen some of the worst that crypto has to offer in the form of Luna, imploding, ftx, and, you know, a lot of other kind of big criminal events as well. So the perception of crypto is quite bad. So the inflow of capital into crypto is less. And this time around, it's less indiscriminate in terms of what assets perform well. So you can't just, you know, blindfold and then throw a dart. Right.
00:00:56.965 - 00:01:04.753, Speaker B: Jason, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. We're here in Singapore and token 2449 in break point.
00:01:04.849 - 00:01:10.961, Speaker A: Yes, sir. Thank you so much for having me, Logan. Looking forward to the week. I think this is the first day of the conference, so we're just getting started.
00:01:11.153 - 00:01:19.801, Speaker B: It's packed. So I was looking at my calendar and I was like, it's just absolute madness. So, again, thank you so much for making some time to make this happen.
00:01:19.873 - 00:01:23.817, Speaker A: You know, I appreciate you for having me. I heard there's like 800 side events.
00:01:23.921 - 00:01:24.433, Speaker B: Oh, God.
00:01:24.489 - 00:01:28.017, Speaker A: So I don't know how many I can make, but I try to make a few of them.
00:01:28.081 - 00:01:59.961, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I wanted to start out and say I've watched quite a few of your podcasts, and for me, podcasting has been this crazy journey and has really taken me much farther than I personally kind of thought it would. And as someone that's kind of been doing this for much longer than I, I would love to learn just how you started your podcast, why you started it, and kind of like how you run it, because to me, it's been one of the largest life hacks getting to talk with really cool people.
00:02:00.063 - 00:02:46.827, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that was exactly the reason I started my podcast, which is called blockcrunch. So every week or so for the past, call it six years, I've been talking to a founder or an investor or some sort of builder in crypto just to kind of, you know, get into their heads a little bit and understand why they're in this space, what they're building. And the reason I started that was actually because I read this tweet from Naval, who's a famous angel investor in Silicon Valley. And he gave this piece of advice which resonated with me, which was, if you can code, then you should code. If you can't code, then you should build content, because those are the two best ways for young people to gain leverage. So I went to coding bootcamp, but I'm a horrible programmer, so I know, okay, that's not my lane. So I wanted to create content, and I wanted to kind of break into the space at that time.
00:02:46.827 - 00:03:14.799, Speaker A: So in 2018, I basically read every single white paper I could get my hands on. And once I ran out of things to read, I wanted to talk to people in the space. And you probably had the same issue as well. It was very hard to get in touch with people. Crypto Twitter really wasn't a thing back then. So the only excuse I could get people to talk to me, people who are running funds, people who are running projects, was that, hey, I'm going to do some marketing for you on the podcast for free, so come on and talk to me for an hour. So that's kind of just balloon from there.
00:03:14.799 - 00:03:21.799, Speaker A: And that was very much deliberate. Right. That was the kind of leverage that I was looking for. And then that gave me my break into the space.
00:03:21.967 - 00:03:48.539, Speaker B: Naval has a lot of good tweets. I think I read that one as well. How to Get Rich Without Getting Lucky. Another great one. Yeah, no, it's super interesting, I guess. From your time doing the podcast, has there been any huge takeaways that you've kind of been like, wow, this has really changed my mind, or what are some things, I guess, that you kind of enjoyed throughout that process?
00:03:48.707 - 00:04:30.185, Speaker A: I think it's just that it's just being able to get access to people very early on. So, for instance, I think I interviewed Anatoly from Solana in 2019, and I was checking at that time. I was researching the episode. I was trying to see, okay, are there other podcasts that I brought Anatoly on? And there was only one, which was Kevin Rose's crypto podcast, which he did, like, two episodes on, and then it ended. So I was the second person in the world ever to interview the founder of Solana, which became this huge thing later on. So having access to people kind of before their journeys is, like, very interesting to me, and it kind of mirrors the journey of a VC as well, because that's what you're trying to find. You're trying to find people before they kind of build their kind of massive successes.
00:04:30.185 - 00:05:01.377, Speaker A: So that was like a kind of VC light experience for me to get started. I think that really changed that. That kind of shaped how I. How I approached my job as an investor as well. And then I think just number two is in terms of the optimism, right? Because I think this space is so cyclical. Every four years, you get a deep bear market, everybody's depressed. And then I kind of get my optimism rekindled when I talk to builders who are just almost naively optimistic about the space, and they just talk about the future in such kind, grandiose terms that you can help but also feel excited.
00:05:01.377 - 00:05:05.297, Speaker A: So there's definitely, like, an emotional kind of therapeutic element to it as well.
00:05:05.481 - 00:05:45.969, Speaker B: I just did a podcast with Santiago in South Korea, and we were talking about how the timeline. If you don't do a 10x within six months, everybody's going crazy. I'm like, look, bitcoin's up from what, like, 15K? Solana was at $8, now at 130, and people are freaking out. And so I would definitely echo those sentiments as needing to renew your sense of enthusiasm about the space. It's much more helpful to talk with builders or founders. It's always fun to get to hear people's spicy takes.
00:05:46.057 - 00:05:56.925, Speaker A: I don't know if you feel like. Because you're a VC as well, I don't know if you feel that the conversations you have on a podcast with founders and the conversations you have with them in the pitching room are different. Are they similar, or do you feel like.
00:05:57.615 - 00:06:00.407, Speaker B: I feel like they're definitely more relaxed.
00:06:00.511 - 00:06:01.223, Speaker A: In a podcast.
00:06:01.279 - 00:06:24.871, Speaker B: In the podcast, because I. We were kind of talking a little bit earlier. I really like talking with the engineers. I like having them get into the nitty gritty and be like, all right, nerd, out with me for, like, an hour. Explain how this thing works. And I think just be honest about it, like, whether it's whatever design decisions that you're making. I like the opinionated founders.
00:06:24.871 - 00:06:59.329, Speaker B: If you draw, like, a hard line in the stand and say, hey, I'm going north, I'm like, I may disagree with you, but I like that opinionatedness. And so I have found that with founders, they like that storytelling. And sometimes in a pitch, it's like, all right, like, what's the market size? What are you building the product and trying to like, condense that down into maybe like, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and in just a more relaxed Setting, I found people are much more open and kind of storytelling mode instead of pitch mode.
00:06:59.457 - 00:07:16.761, Speaker A: Yeah, I enjoy that as well. And I feel like there's almost an implicit assumption in interviews that you are on the founder side, you're trying to help them tell the stories, whereas in a pitch, the founders feel like you're the counterparty, they're trying to convince you, they're trying to sell you something and you're very skeptical of it. So, yeah, how do I agree? I actually do enjoy the interviews quite a bit more.
00:07:16.913 - 00:07:41.029, Speaker B: It's. It's fun. The long form, I think is the most interesting thing. And especially the in person podcasts. Your in person podcasts have been great. The podcast recording studio here in Singapore. I think that element of just being able to vibe in person, it hits different that I would say it's been harder for me to recreate on like a Twitch or a Riverside.
00:07:41.197 - 00:07:53.861, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the challenge. I guess that's the. That's the. That came out of necessity because I'm based here in Singapore. A lot of the founders we talk to are based in the US for instance, so it's just difficult for me to travel, you know, every single month there.
00:07:54.053 - 00:07:57.181, Speaker B: Long flight back to New York, 19 hours.
00:07:57.253 - 00:08:14.425, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. So I can't really do that. And I want to do things that are more or less timely as well. So I don't like to like backlog 20 episodes on one trip and then release them. So, yeah, I have to make the Riverside. But I agree, like in person ones, you get a lot more nuance and you get to like interrupt and interject as well.
00:08:14.585 - 00:08:40.929, Speaker B: So maybe jumping off that I would love to hear. You were at Spartan Capital and then ultimately you spun out and decided to do your own fund, Tangent. All prop capital. Can you tell me or like kind of give the perhaps abbreviated version of your investing journey up to Tangent and why you decided to go out and do your own thing?
00:08:41.097 - 00:09:23.287, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, for, for me, when I joined Spartan, it was in 2018, so there were not a lot of liquid crypto funds around. So this concept of the long short crypto fund wasn't even a thing. It was very hard sell for LPs, but I thought it was exciting and I wanted to be in crypto before that. I already had my interest kind of kindled by looking into crypto and dabbling a little bit. And here I was back in Hong Kong. I met my former boss, Kelvin, who used to be a partner at Goldman Sachs. So he was one of the very few People in this space at that time that actually had a career in finance and managing funds and kind of understanding risk and markets, whereas most of the funds that were around were run by more kind of people on the technical side that understood the blockchains but didn't understand markets.
00:09:23.287 - 00:09:47.535, Speaker A: So they were not well equipped to tackle liquid markets. So I thought, okay, if I wanted to learn about crypto, I can kind of do it by myself by reading or doing the podcast. But if I wanted to learn about markets, the best way to do is to be under someone's wing. So I joined Kelvin, I think one month after Spartan Capital started. I think back then we were like $9 million. So a very tiny experimental fund. And then subsequently we grew it to, I think, probably one of the biggest funds in Asia now.
00:09:47.535 - 00:10:29.745, Speaker A: So we have a hedge fund strategy and also a venture fund strategy. And at the time, this is 2021 or 2022 or so, we've gotten to such a scale that I kind of missed some aspects of my job when it was still in the zero to one phase where I got to work with founders one on one and build personal relationships and sit down for two hours, just talk about specific projects. You couldn't really do that at that big of a scale anymore. So I decided, hey, I'm going to spin out and start small again and this time just invest with my own capital alongside my partner Darrell. So that's kind of how Tangent started. So now we're an angel fund. We participate on the venture side, but we also take opportunities in the liquid side.
00:10:29.745 - 00:10:35.665, Speaker A: And we're building up a team of six right now. So that's been my journey for the past two years.
00:10:37.645 - 00:11:06.773, Speaker B: It's interesting because some people really thrive in that 0 to 1 and some are like, fuck this, I hate this. And so it's interesting, kind of the dichotomy because you really have to be a self starter. You have to go out and make things happen where maybe perhaps the more A type personalities that are super organized and need structure may not operate as well in that environment.
00:11:06.949 - 00:11:32.285, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think there's a huge personality aspect to it. I think Chow from Alliance talked about the same thing when I remember. So he runs an incubator in crypto now called Alliance. It's quite well known. I remember when he left his former company Masari, because I read a lot of his research reports when we were at Masari and he mentioned that he feels like he's more of a zero to one type of guy. So when Masari got to that Scale. He thought I wanted to get my hands dirty again.
00:11:32.285 - 00:11:42.665, Speaker A: That's very much the same kind of rationale for me too. I want to get my hands dirty again. And there's no better way than to invest your own capital. Just be extremely selective and just work with a very small group of people.
00:11:44.625 - 00:12:20.389, Speaker B: The fund is doing a mixture of both liquid and venture, perhaps a little bit more on the liquid side. How are you guys, I would say were In September of 2024, this market cycle, if you want to call it that, is perhaps different or the same than others. How are you guys viewing this? We had the run up in Q4 of 2023 and Q1 of 2024 and then we' had chop. How are you guys thinking about the market today?
00:12:20.557 - 00:12:47.659, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this cycle is universally agreed upon that it's the most difficult cycle for liquid fund managers, liquid investors, since 2017. The reason being last cycle you only have to get the beta call right, which is directionally long. Crypto was already the contrarian bet. Nobody was long crypto. Nobody knew what crypto was. This is before DeFi, before NFTs, before metaverses. So as long as you called the cycle right, you can buy almost whatever asset you probably pool, multiples.
00:12:47.659 - 00:13:26.913, Speaker A: This cycle is very different in that the world is already fully aware of what crypto is. In fact, they've seen some of the worst that crypto has to offer in the form of Luna, imploding, FTX and you know, a lot of other kind of big criminal events as well. So the perception of crypto is quite bad. So the inflow of capital into crypto is less, and this time around it's less indiscriminate in terms of what assets perform well. So you can't just, you know, blindfold and then throw a dart. But this time, you know, outside of Bitcoin itself, Solana, maybe a handful of smaller coins, there's actually not that many bets that paid off or outperformed. So that was a very difficult part.
00:13:26.913 - 00:13:59.435, Speaker A: And then I think the other difficult part was also because we are getting more into mainstream now with the launch of the etf, crypto starts to trade more in line at times with traditional markets. So you start to have to pay to pay attention to things like fomc, rate cuts, Fed decisions, macro markets, things that you don't really need to care about. If in 2017 you just have to know, hey, which L1 is the best? And then you make a liquid bet on that and you can pull multiples. I think the game is Getting more and more solved. And the more solved the game is, the less alpha there is just, you know, hanging there for people to grab.
00:14:00.095 - 00:15:08.683, Speaker B: Yeah, I fully agree. I think the space today is trying to figure out, I would still say there's still some ambiguity about the different infrastructure, but I think what is kind of agreed upon is that we have, I would say, pockets of infrastructure that is there now that should be able to continuously scale in the future and it is time to actually go up the stack to applications. And I think the hard part is especially for liquid funds. I've been chatting with more and more liquid funds. A lot of them are like, hey, why should I buy this multi billion FDV token that's doing unlocks where VC bought at a certain early round and I'm going to get dumped on. And so I think now it's been interesting to me talking with just more managers in general of saying, hey, how should we quantify these things as a measure of success? Whether that's either cash flows or revenues, different users. What are some things that you guys kind of look for at Tangent? Are they more tangible? Is it more, hey, this narrative is going to do well.
00:15:08.683 - 00:15:09.929, Speaker B: How do you approach it?
00:15:10.107 - 00:15:39.665, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think so we have three kind of big buckets that we like to invest in and I'll talk about timeframe separately. So the first bucket is coordination networks. Right. So we think about what crypto is actually good for. So if you really honest with yourself, crypto is actually not that great for most things. So if you try to build a Web3 equivalent of a Web2 app, chances are it will be more expensive, clunkier, slower and worse in terms of ux. So crypto is really only good at one thing on the application layer, which is coordinating people or resources around the world.
00:15:39.665 - 00:16:07.893, Speaker A: And that's exactly what bitcoin was. Right? Bitcoin, outside of money, is just a bunch of guys around the world running ASICS and agreeing to maintain his ledger without ever meeting each other. So that idea can be applied to so many more things, I think. And some people call it dpin. And there are many examples where you actually need geographically decentralized nodes that are maintained by blockchain to work. So for instance, one of our port codes is called geodnet. So they're building a geospatial network.
00:16:07.893 - 00:16:36.257, Speaker A: A geospatial network is basically a network that helps you refine the accuracy of gps. So in that case you actually need decentralization. And then there are things like helium, which we're looking into, which is providing mobile coverage service. Those things also need to be decentralized. So that's number one, coordination networks. Number two, we also try to look at zero to one use cases. So I think because of how easy it was to make money last cycle, a lot of people just built copycats, right? So there's like avion this chain, uniswap in this chain.
00:16:36.257 - 00:17:02.897, Speaker A: I'm categorically against that. I want to see just new people building completely new zero to one type of ideas that are only possible in crypto. So I think we are seeing some hints of that with some social fi experiments. So we, you know, play around on both liquid and venture side on that. So that's kind of pocket number two. And I think the final category is just kind of markets for everything. I think the one thing that crypto has proven to be extremely good at is creating 24,7 global liquidity.
00:17:02.897 - 00:17:29.325, Speaker A: Because we trade crypto every day, we look at crypto every day, we kind of take it for granted. But it's actually insane that there is this huge market that anybody can chuck money in and take money out of at any time anywhere in the world. I think that enables a lot of use cases that are simply not possible before. So we're starting to see things like Poly Market becoming the world's biggest predictions market. Right. And a lot of people who use it don't even know that it's a crypto application. So those three buckets are what we're generally look for.
00:17:29.325 - 00:17:40.195, Speaker A: And in terms of whether we find this project very late stage, in which case we try to play it on the liquid side, or very early stage, in which case we'll play it on the venture side. That kind of is just an execution thing.
00:17:40.315 - 00:18:24.215, Speaker B: As you go one by one, if we can. I think I totally echo the sentiments. I kind of view these blockchains as different ledgers or even like, I mean they are databases and the historical databases are siloed. They don't talk to each other. And now that you have a global database, it's kind of like if you had the New York Stock Exchange, Japan Stock Exchange, and you can collapse that into one and kind of globally all agree on things. And I think to that point it's really about creating the shared standards that everybody can opt into, which makes it really unique from a coordination standpoint.
00:18:24.555 - 00:18:54.339, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree. And I think some investors call that dpin. And I think the discourse on Deepin now is still very, very rudimentary. I think people either categorically reject Deepin and basically Say that, oh, this is all just financed by token incentives. They're just bootstrapping supply side and nobody's coming for demand. I think the more nuanced discussion is there are some use cases that actually require Deepin and many use cases that actually don't. So there's actually a report that just came out from a Twitter account called knowerofmarkets.
00:18:54.339 - 00:19:17.003, Speaker A: I think like two days ago they dropped 100 page deepin report. I highly recommend checking it out. Super, super interesting. But in general, I think Deepin is a little bit harder to build than Defi in the sense that you actually require the hardware part. So a lot of the guys we see coming into Deepin are actually not crypto guys. They're like hardware guys. But yeah.
00:19:17.003 - 00:19:21.607, Speaker A: So that's my little preamble on why we're excited about Deepin overseeing.
00:19:21.771 - 00:20:16.699, Speaker B: I think Deepin is super interesting for that. You can actually incentivize people to do something in the real world. And I think to your point, the investors are kind of like either split as like, hey, it's just like another version of a Ponzi because you're paying people to do things with made up tokens, or it's actually really unique in terms of capex reduction coordination. And we're starting to see those experiments play out and I think with even helium kind of being the first tbd, if they had got their tokenomics cracked on the first try because obviously they were kind of like the first to try this out. But you'll get continuous iteration and things like Geonet or Adrena or Dawn. Those are really interesting projects that can actually make better products, not better crypto products, which I'm super excited about.
00:20:16.867 - 00:21:08.995, Speaker A: I think the most important question to ask these founders is like, what is the actual unit economics here, right? Like are you actually commercially saving money by doing this if you strip away the token? So in the example of Geonet, we just did an interview with the founder of Geonet. This guy has been in navigation for like 20 years, right? He's been building GPS networks for 20 years and he was basically saying in order to set up this GPS refinement network, which the technical name is Real Time Kinematics, in order to set this up, he will need to apply for licenses with the government and rent a location in like thousands of places. So the bootstrapping cost, the equivalent cost for the network they have today, which is bootstrapped essentially by just people ordering the notes and putting it at home, would be hundreds of millions of dollars versus now they are making money from other people setting this up because they are selling the notes. So there is actually a commercial benefit to some deep end use cases. So we hope to discover more of these.
00:21:09.415 - 00:21:52.551, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm super bullish deep end. I think people have kind of underestimated it and I'm really looking forward to the continuing experimentation because I think it is probably going to surprise people to the upside. But I think again to your point earlier, these projects are harder. And I think when you can actually, if these projects do eventually produce cash flows or some type of revenue, it's both bullish and bearish. It's bullish in the sense that hey, you can actually go to institutions and funds and saying, hey, this is not a meme. We're actually making money. But then it's also bearish because you can valuate.
00:21:52.551 - 00:21:54.319, Speaker B: And it's also not a meme.
00:21:54.447 - 00:22:13.887, Speaker A: I guess bullish and bearish is relative, right? It's probably bearish relative to some of the sky high valuations you can see with L1s and L2s without much traction. Because I think the good example here is defi. A lot of people already know how to value defi. They look at the cash flows, they look at how much token are burned. So the multiples on defi this cycle compared to when Defi was first around is much more sensible.
00:22:13.951 - 00:22:14.175, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:14.215 - 00:22:49.125, Speaker A: So last time you'd have like two 2000x earnings on some perp exchanges. This time there's still a lot of variance, but you can see that the market is maturing. So that could happen for Deepin as well. Because can you imagine like if people are valuing like Celestia on earnings, for instance, it would be down another 90%. And this is not fighting Celestia. I'm just basically laying out like how the market is thinking about different verticals in crypto. So I think you're right in that if depin becomes a very cash flow heavy vertical, it might put a ceiling on the upside relative to something like L1s and L2, but this is relative to other app protocols that might not even make any revenues at all.
00:22:50.105 - 00:23:00.041, Speaker B: I'm really just curious because some fund managers are thinking about cash flows, some are like screwed cash flows. And so it's kind of the interesting dichotomy.
00:23:00.153 - 00:23:35.561, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that comes down to the challenge of timeframe. So one of the things that I try to drill into the heads of my team is navigating timeframes, which I think crypto is historically bad at, which is also where a lot of the alpha comes from. So what I mean by timeframe is in the same market with the same assets and same names. You have people who think about them in like a decade timeframe. So someone might think that hey SEI is going to be the next Solana in the next 10 years. And then you have people who are trading on the one week timeframe who are trading, hey, SEI is having the first tranche of unlock for venture investors. We got to do this and this.
00:23:35.561 - 00:24:19.565, Speaker A: And then people who are not even thinking about the context that they're trading, they're just looking at the chart at the 15 minute, which is, oh, this is a support or resistance. This is the only market in the world where you have venture investors that are generally taking like 10, 20 year timeframes and 15 minute chart trader buying the same ticker. So that's where a lot of the confusion for the market comes from because people are unable to navigate timeframes. So you can be long term, extremely bullish on Solana, but you can think that, okay, in the midterm, the Fed's decision or macro markets would be bad for markets. So it could be bearish. But in the very, very short term you could think that, hey, this chart looks good, it could bounce. So being able to reconcile those three different timeframes in your mind I think is almost an impossible task for most investors.
00:24:19.565 - 00:24:26.645, Speaker A: For us, we try to make sure that we know exactly what timeframe we're operating on for each given bet.
00:24:27.545 - 00:25:03.921, Speaker B: I think that's critical. I appreciate you highlighting it because not very many people or retail people understand how either hedge funds or venture funds work. Venture funds typically have the 10 year lifecycle. They can't think for a decade plus without having to sell. And then. But hedge funds and traders, which there are a lot of, especially on the trading side within crypto, could be trading the 15 minute charts or they could be trading quarterly and just like kind of doing long only. But then people have redemptions.
00:25:03.921 - 00:25:33.803, Speaker B: And so I think it's a really interesting asset class because you have so many mixtures of opinions and the time to liquidity of these things is so much more condensed than kind of a traditional startup process of doing an IPO that you get varied outcomes and people often get confused about how they're actually approaching the asset class, if they even have a process to begin with.
00:25:33.979 - 00:26:18.725, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that that's absolutely right. I think for investors it's, you know, on the venture side we generally try to run away from trends. So when everybody is hyping up crypto and AI, for instance, that's probably the worst time you can possibly invest as a long term investor and lock yourself into a ten year thing versus for traders. We fully embrace narratives, right? If there is something hot, kind of invoke the George Soros quote, which is like, if I see a bubble forming, I don't run away from it, I pour more fire into it and participate in. So I think narratives is important for traders in the sense that you want to embrace them, but they are important for VCs in that you want to run away from them.
00:26:19.225 - 00:26:32.085, Speaker B: So maybe moving on to that second component, I believe it was the zero to one applications. What things have really gotten you excited either within the last six months or year of the market.
00:26:32.435 - 00:27:19.339, Speaker A: Yeah. So zero to one is really a catch all for any and all types of applications that people can dream up with. And if I can come up with examples, I think that's bearish. I actually want someone to kind of tell me something that I have never thought of before. So I think one vertical that we've been exploring is like, okay, can we use crypto as a verification layer for AI inference? Because there's a big challenge around, okay, if I put in this prompt into this AI model and it spits out something, how do I know that it's actually computed by this model that I wanted to. Is there a way that we can use cryptographic guarantees to verify the output of this? But you know, I don't know how commercially big that is as an opportunity, but that's something we're looking into as something that's uniquely enabled by crypto. I think this second group is actually overlaps with the third group quite a bit as well.
00:27:19.339 - 00:27:39.907, Speaker A: So for instance, like prediction markets, I would consider them an example of you being able to build a market for everything, but also a 0 to 1 use case in that yes, we did have prediction markets in Web2 before, but never at this scale, never with this much flexibility in terms of anybody can just come in and start a market right away. So we're constantly looking out for things like that that just no one has thought of before.
00:27:40.091 - 00:28:53.305, Speaker B: It's interesting just how long it took kind of prediction markets to really get to that level of scale that we've started to see with this election. I mean, I Remember back in 2017, I believe Augur launched in like 2018 and everybody was excited about it, but there wasn't even, I believe DAI just launched, but there wasn't even like two good stable coins to do any settling. And it was perhaps a little bit too early. But it kind of goes to show with some of these consumer applications, especially like products where it's either user or revenue base, they take a while to bake. But that kind of is also similar in the traditional venture category where not everything is this crazy outcome and you really have to continue to iterate on the product and make it exceptional. And it's been cool to see that these prediction markets are starting have gotten to the point where people have iterated enough on the product that people don't know that they're using polymarkets on the back end, but they just look at it to see, oh, where's the market? Thinking about Kamala or Trump within the election?
00:28:53.805 - 00:29:31.681, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't remember. But augur when they first came out, you have to like wait, I don't know, eight minutes for the blocks to sync up so that you can actually use the platform. So if you're, if the blocks have been finalized and you're at the front page, you have to actually wait in order, in order before you can lock into the application to use it. So the UX has come a long way in crypto. And I think Another example of 0 to 1 use case is also something like Athena, which we're investors in. So Athena has built a delta neutral stablecoin. Basically they open a long position with eth, they put it into lido to stake it and then they use that as collateral to short ETH on a centralized exchange.
00:29:31.681 - 00:30:05.643, Speaker A: So they create a delta neutral position that's theoretically equal to a dollar. So they tokenize that, that becomes more or less of a stable coin, but it's providing you yield from the stake lido front and also on the funding front from exchanges. So what you created is this newfangled Internet bond that was at one point I think paying like 30% of token incentives, maybe like 10% without, which is fundamentally just impossible without crypto because it's founded in staking rewards. So stuff like that that I think people just simply cannot build outside of crypto excites me quite a bit.
00:30:05.739 - 00:30:20.229, Speaker B: What is the closest analogy for that maybe to the tradfi world and maybe an analogy is not good. Would it be like a hedge fund doing an arb or how do you kind of think about it? Or is that just the incorrect way to think about it? Because this is the more crypto native format?
00:30:20.397 - 00:31:00.055, Speaker A: I guess. Yeah, it's very hard to think of an analogy. I guess if you invest in a hedge fund that does an ARB and you tokenize the ownership of the hedge fund and peck it to a dollar and then you allow other people to re hypothecate off of that, use that dollar as collateral to trade and so on. I think when we invested, a lot of people were extremely dismissive because this is right after Luna and people were looking at it and thinking, oh my God, another stable coin doing this like complex financial shit, it's going to blow up again. But we dug under the hood and we were way more comfortable with the risk. So for context, we saw Luna multiple times during my last tenure as an investor. We turn it down every time.
00:31:00.055 - 00:31:21.265, Speaker A: We never held any Luna, we never held any UST because we saw the blowout risk. We just didn't know when it would happen. With Athena, I think I was a lot more comfortable with the risks that I was getting into, but that was also the opportunity. The market is so informed by short term sentiment that they fail to actually dig under the hood and understand the mechanism and take that 5, 10 year view.
00:31:21.725 - 00:31:52.605, Speaker B: Maybe this perhaps leads us to the last thing that you mentioned was the financialization of everything, whether it's the hedge fund that's tokenized, that's a dollar. How do you think about that? Because I think on one extreme you kind of take that to the meme coins, the whiffs of the world, the popcats where people get excited about dog and cat coins. And then on the other side, I would say the more bare bones is probably the revenue or cash flow tokens.
00:31:53.145 - 00:32:29.105, Speaker A: I think the biggest outcome from this markets for everything thesis is obviously the whole DEFI vertical. And people still underestimate how crazy DeFi was. Because if you think about Uniswap, for instance, the first iteration of Uniswap was literally just like one line of code, right? The AMM algorithm which allowed for this, you know, global markets of everything for people to trade on. So we're looking for more moments like that. In terms of like the other end of the spectrum for meme coins, we're kind of like torn on meme coins. So we did invest in a meme project. This is before the meme coin mania took off in 2023.
00:32:29.105 - 00:32:41.941, Speaker A: So we invested in a project called Meme Land. It was a founder bet because the founder, Ray Chan, he is the creator of 9Gag, which is one of the largest websites in the world. I think they were ranked like 300 on Alexa or something after 18 years in operation, which is a crazy feature.
00:32:41.973 - 00:32:42.693, Speaker B: It is wild.
00:32:42.829 - 00:33:14.921, Speaker A: It's crazy. And I knew him because that's how I First got into contact with memes right when they first came about. And I know that this guy understands Internet culture. He scaled a business over a decade on the idea of kind of digital identity and digital culture. And my thesis for it was whatever. He created this meme coin, it will probably be a conduit for him to distribute products later on, which is exactly what they're doing. They built Meme land, this NFT collection, this meme coin, and then once they get holders on that and get the community around that meme coin, they're starting to build products.
00:33:14.921 - 00:33:36.847, Speaker A: So one of the first product was like a free staking for eth kind of product and they're building some other social fi. So that was my initial thesis for meme coins which is it's a distribution channel. And then I think like six months later meme coin mania took off. And then now the VCs are writing blogs about. Meme coins are a great distribution channel. And then you look under the hood. None of those meme coins are using their meme coins as a distribution channel for real products.
00:33:36.847 - 00:34:01.105, Speaker A: In fact, if you look at actual examples of meme coins that try to do this, like Shib Shiba Inu, they try to use the meme coin and turn it into a legit L2, it just instantly did not perform. People just didn't care. So in a way, I think my thesis didn't play out the way that I thought it would. But meme coins still kind of rallied off completely different reasons. So it's kind of like a sad win type of situation, I guess when.
00:34:01.185 - 00:34:32.429, Speaker B: You are kind of like approaching the liquid market versus venture market. You said if it's a hot narrative with. On the liquid side, run towards it. If it's kind of a. If you're a venture fund and it's a hot narrative, run away from it. What on the venture side or either founders, have you kind of seen more recently that you are excited or. Or are you pulling back with some of the valuations also ultimately rising today with liquid pumped where it was.
00:34:32.557 - 00:35:02.764, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think last year there's probably like 20, 30 deals done with intents. So we skipped all of them. I think the only one I personally did was cow swap. But this is like last cycle already before people started talking about intents and then the other big vertical was like Zkml and then we just skipped all of that as well. And then crypto AI as well where everybody was pouring money into pre product things at 300 million million. So I just also skipped out on all of that, I just don't believe there's any ev to trading to chasing these hot narratives.
00:35:02.764 - 00:35:32.395, Speaker A: So right now, in terms of what's interesting, I think depin gets a lot of mind share in like smart money circles. Like people write blog posts on them. But if you look at the aggregate market cap on Deepin networks, they're actually not that high relative to all other verticals. In terms of the quality of people coming into this space, I think it's the highest out of all the verticals in the past few months in terms of valuations. They're also the more reasonable ones. So I'd say I'm personally spending way more time in Deepin than any other verticals. Just out of personal interest.
00:35:32.395 - 00:35:40.375, Speaker A: I'm still paying attention to social and I have since 2018. I got burned on almost every attempt, but that's something I'm just personally interested in.
00:35:40.795 - 00:36:32.057, Speaker B: Yeah, it is interesting. You said something earlier in the podcast about the more traditional Web2 founders on the deep inside coming into Web3, and I think that's been super cool because it's not your quote unquote, crypto native. They see, they've been like really domain experts within their specific field. And they realize, going back to your other point of this global coordination network can be used to really accelerate the adoption of my network if I plug into it, incentivize people to do things in the real world. And to me that's been super interesting because it's not a, hey, let's just slap a token on it and it go 1000x. It's like, okay, we actually want to use the technology for the sake of the technology. And we just think this is the best avenue to pursue.
00:36:32.241 - 00:36:57.397, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to give you another example of like founders coming into the space that are not crypto native at all, we invested in a company called Aminochain, which subsequently went on to race around from a 16Z. So they're building. These guys are not crypto natives. They are like bio, what do you call it? Biomedicine experts. And they realized there's a problem with this concept of biobanks. So biobanks are basically massive fridges where you keep human samples.
00:36:57.397 - 00:37:34.273, Speaker A: So hair, blood, semen, sweat, whatever. And then pharmaceutical companies purchase these samples in order to develop drugs. But apparently the compliance process is very difficult because to purchase like human samples, there's a ton of paperwork you need to sign and the transactions are extremely cumbersome. It takes way too long. So these guys realized, actually, why don't we Just put everything on chain, you know, put all this data as like an NFT so that you can just one click transact between biobanks and they actually already produce revenue when we talk to them. And these guys are not crypto natives at all. They are people who were trying to solve a real problem, who stumbled across crypto as the solution.
00:37:34.273 - 00:37:51.769, Speaker A: I think that's as bullish a validation for crypto as like anything versus if you compare a lot of founders in the last cycle, they don't really reason from first principles and then arrive at crypto. They kind of reason from what can I do with crypto? Let's just try to build some bullshit and then that rarely ends. Well.
00:37:51.937 - 00:38:08.401, Speaker B: There was something on my timeline today, it was like a Steve Jobs quote of start with the customer experience and work your way back instead of starting with the technical solution and trying to jam in the customer experience. And I think that rings even more true for crypto now than ever.
00:38:08.513 - 00:38:37.565, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. So I really welcome these types of founders. Obviously I think the real people solving real problems take longer time and it's harder. Right. Like you said, Deepin is very difficult to build and scale. So if you map this to historical technical trends, it actually almost corresponds perfectly to the Gartner hype cycle where you have the 2021 extreme promises that failed to deliver and you massively crashed and now people are in the trough, the disillusionment into the plateau of productivity. Right.
00:38:37.565 - 00:38:47.225, Speaker A: They're kind of slowly building real things, things, but it's going to take longer. The upside is not going to be as immediate, but we're here for it, I guess.
00:38:48.445 - 00:39:10.317, Speaker B: What do you feel like? Obviously I think AI is probably nearing the top. What things you would say looking forward to the next year, two years. What things you kind of feel like are coming out of the trough of illusionment that actually will work given a longer timeframe?
00:39:10.461 - 00:39:51.527, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there will be probably two or three DPIN networks that could be valued as high as some of the kind of top 20 L1s, which I think is a quite contrarian opinion because if it's not, usually crypto prices it in very quickly. Right. You have deep end networks trading at crazy valuations. So I do think that's probably one of the more promising ones. I still have faith in social. Every cycle I say this, every cycle I'm disappointed, but I still think that the kind of constantly online, degenerate, irreverent culture of crypto fits in very well with some sort of social product. And I think NFTs and meme coins and the recent kind of quote unquote social fi, they're all just aspects of the same thing.
00:39:51.527 - 00:39:56.995, Speaker A: I don't know what that big thing is, but I'm pretty confident something will come out that will actually hit mainstream.
00:39:57.935 - 00:40:22.001, Speaker B: Yeah, it has been interesting to me. Social is just hard to underwrite. And so is gaming, to be honest, at least for me. All right, is the game fun? If it's fun, then cool. But gaming studios spend lots and lots of money trying to build games. And it's not that I don't think crypto gaming will work long term. It obviously will.
00:40:22.001 - 00:41:06.209, Speaker B: I think we'll kind of go full metaverse, Apple goggles, the VR goggles. But it's hard to place a bet on that either as a liquid fund or a venture fund, at least today, in my opinion. On the social, what are you looking for? Is it just like that spark with initial community traction? We kind of saw some things with like Blast or friend tech, and again, those have been a kind of a flash in the pan. You kind of think something's happening and. And then it just looks like retail likes meme coins. And so how are you kind of like you say, you keep getting burnt, but maybe the better question is what have you kind of learned from kind of seeing the different experiments over the last couple of years?
00:41:06.377 - 00:41:52.121, Speaker A: What I've learned is that hockey sticks are not as reliable in web3 as they're in web2, because web3 runs the narratives and hypes and that is aggravated by token incentives. So in Web two you always have this kind of lightning in a bottle moment where if you see your users kind of break up like this. Right, Like a hockey stick. And I think a 16Z, the web2arm wrote a good article about this where they talk about what is the threshold percentage of retention for 7 day users for you to know that you capture lightning in a bottle. So like for instance, for like Facebook or Instagram, I think not seven day, 30, 30 days. So if you retain like 30% of your cohort after 30 days, then you know you probably have lightning in a bottle. In crypto that's not as reliable because you know, everybody's airdrop farming.
00:41:52.121 - 00:42:12.583, Speaker A: That's, that's a lot of noise. So if you see user charts taking off and you think, hey, this is the, this is the start, that could actually be the end for some of the crypto social. So I think that that's the biggest element. How do you remove noise from, from actual traction? And the only solution is you use these applications and you bet on them and you get burned again and again. That's what we've been doing.
00:42:12.729 - 00:43:18.585, Speaker B: Nice. I think good words of wisdom. And it's been interesting for me, just coming from the product background, in Silicon Valley, we don't have the basics of how long does it take someone to go through the funnel, do a swap, trying to remove friction from that process, understanding how long people spend on certain pages. And I do think as we get more and more sophisticated, quote unquote, sophisticated builders over the long term, I would be excited to see some of those metrics kind of come because I think again, crypto has been a lot of experimentation, which is great and was much needed. I'm curious though, how it will kind of continue to evolve over the next five years or so, but maybe switching topics slightly. I think today we've seen a number of iterations, even on the smart contract side. Ethereum has always kind of been king in the smart contract world.
00:43:18.585 - 00:43:49.813, Speaker B: They have shipped 484 4, which allowed blobs and kind of more data throughput, and now L2s. You have base arbitrum, optimism, et cetera. But it's been interesting just the last six, seven months. And maybe this just correlates with the rise of Solana. How have you kind of viewed this in your mind with either Ethereum's waning sentiment? Do you think that turns around? What is your kind of point of view on the infrastructure side with eth?
00:43:49.989 - 00:44:17.543, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we did a podcast episode with this roundtable with my co host Sanat from Dragonfly, and with our friend Yuan from Blockchain Cap as well. You guys search for it. It's called disaggregation of eth. This is probably like six months ago when I talked about ETH having a middle child problem because. Because everyone and the mothers were bullish on the ETH ETF launch. And I was basically outlining the case that, well, in TrapFi's mind, their crypto allocation is already fulfilled by Bitcoin. So they've already deployed to Bitcoin.
00:44:17.543 - 00:44:57.755, Speaker A: And macro is talk. The TRAFI guys are talking about Bitcoin as if it's a macro asset, right? To talk about digital gold inflation hedge, ETH for them is very much a tech bet. And there are plenty more better tech bets in their opinion, right? By their frameworks, if they look at earnings, if they look at growth potential secular trends like AI, there are a lot more better tech bets out there than eth. So in my opinion, the eth, ETF was always going to disappoint and it was only a matter of time before the market came around to that. So we have that view as of June that the entire market was propped up by false promises of the ethtf. I shared my view. I got shat on by everybody for being bearish.
00:44:57.755 - 00:45:43.889, Speaker A: And then the market collapsed afterwards. So that was kind of a validation that, okay, I think the interest in ETH has been overstated. I think the way out of it is really just you got to fill the block space with actual use cases, right? Like if people, if you invest in real things that people use and they're built on eth, then you introduce newer capital and then interest in ETH growth. So it all comes back to the fundamentals. But I think that the second part of that is like, does this L2 thesis fundamentally hurt value accrual to eth? Right. If you look at L2s posting back onto L1, it's actually not as clear a value accrual as a monolithic L1. So that's the big debate between Solana versus ETH right now.
00:45:43.889 - 00:46:08.195, Speaker A: Even if ETH gets a lot of fundamental development and adoption, if most of it is happening on L2s and the L1 is getting a fraction of the fee, can it still accrue value? I'm not entirely sure on that yet. So we haven't really had. I don't think we've held ETH for quite a while. I mean, we're paying attention to a lot of stuff that's happening there, but as an asset, I think it's a painful one to hold.
00:46:09.015 - 00:46:58.629, Speaker B: Yeah, it has been painful. I mean, I used to be a pretty big eth, Maxie, at one point in time and kind of slowly over time shifted my point of view as I felt like I kind of went down the nerd rabbit hole. But to me it's just been a little surprising. But also, I don't know, interesting. Just watching kind of the community start to question some of the long held beliefs. And I think perhaps because crypto is so tribal and to your point, there are all these narratives, people like to pile in on them, whether because it's traders or retail or the combination. And it's just interesting to see that kind of unwind a little bit and kind of ask some of the more fundamental questions.
00:46:58.629 - 00:47:18.427, Speaker B: And it's again, I'm a little nervous about it because if that starts to unwind, I'm curious if that starts to ripple down to others. But it's just interesting to hear people speak about the value accrual and how these things will ultimately work long term.
00:47:18.571 - 00:48:07.419, Speaker A: I mean, I think there is a point in time or valuation where ETH becomes more or less fairly valued, but it's a middle child in the sense that if you are looking to bet on digital money, trustless digital money, Bitcoin is obviously bigger and more liquid and more recognized. So that sound money or ultrasound money meme I never fully understood. I thought it was just crypto trying to push it, but trap I never really taken it. And then on the tech side, the valuation is so high that it doesn't provide the same type of upside if a lower value L1 takes off or it gets the same amount of traction. So I think for this cycle it was Solana. A lot of people see kind of Solana as the tech crypto native growth bet, and then Bitcoin as kind of the macro money bet. And then ETH is kind of in the middle.
00:48:07.419 - 00:48:33.159, Speaker A: It's not cheap enough to be that tech bet that gives you that return, and then it's not quite liquid or big enough compared to Bitcoin to be that kind of macro bet. So it's just a middle child. Nobody likes it. When I shared that view, I think a lot of people pushed back and said that actually ETH is the world's greatest collateral because it's programmable, you can use it in defi and it is being used in defi. But at the end of the day, that thesis alone is not sufficient, I think, to sustain a bit.
00:48:33.287 - 00:49:13.445, Speaker B: I fully agree, maybe to use that to go to the next topic. You have expressed your point of views, contrarian point of views, whether it's kind of being bearish, the eth ETF being bearish, kind of like crypto AI ZK ML. And in hindsight, these things at least today, are very cracked. What is maybe perhaps a strongly held opinion today that you think is perhaps overhyped, that you're either bearish on or some contrarian alpha for the audience?
00:49:13.865 - 00:49:59.927, Speaker A: Contrarian alpha. I think, yeah, I've shared my views on kind of depin being overlooked as a sector. I do think that defi is very hated because the assets since DeFi summer since 2022 have traded nothing but down, with the exception of something like aave, which has recently been getting a bit as of this recording. But I do think when people dismiss defi, they kind of threw the baby out of the bathwater. I think the Defi dream, if it was truly to become the backbone of modern finance, it wasn't even like 1% achieved. So people are writing off Defi too quickly. And it's not just an opinion because we see this reflected in markets as well, in the venture markets.
00:49:59.927 - 00:50:35.655, Speaker A: When we first bet on Athena, you know, it was, it was basically, it's quite contrarian of a bet, I think. And then when we first bet on sei, SEI Network, when they first pitched us, they were positioning as like the L1 for decentralized exchange for defi only. And we were very bullish on the thesis and nobody wanted to touch it. So I still hold that belief. I still think that, you know, Defi is one of the core pillars of crypto, if not the core pillar in the sense that we even incorporated it as, you know, the third pillar of a thesis. But that doesn't necessarily mean you go out and buy uni and AAVE and just pray for the best.
00:50:36.075 - 00:51:31.325, Speaker B: No, I love that and I think it is kind of aligned with our thesis at Frictionless is that these high throughput blockchains enable these new zero to one use cases originally spearheaded by Solana. Now you have the swes, the seis, the monads of the world, aptos and then within that what are the unique applications that you can build? And I think you have to be long on chain volumes like where that value capture is. We have some opinions, but we'll see how it ultimately unfolds. And then I think you have to be structuring along kind of these better business models in terms of new capital formation with dependent actually enabling better unit economics. To me that is really a breakthrough. That is a better product, not a better crypto product.
00:51:31.865 - 00:52:00.565, Speaker A: No, I agree, I agree. And we're starting to see the feature parity gap between web2 and web3 close with things like Hyper Liquid, for instance. I think the experience of using an exchange is not too dissimilar, at least from a UX perspective compared to FTX back in the day. So obviously liquidity is not comparable yet. But yeah, I think we're seeing some actual productivity going back to that garner hype cycle in Defi and a lot of people are sleeping on it.
00:52:01.065 - 00:52:22.985, Speaker B: What are advice to people that either kind of like want to break into crypto or things that you've kind of learned along your journey? I feel like I've made many mistakes in my journey. But what are some things that you feel like if you could only know sooner, it would have kind of like helped you speedrun crypto even faster?
00:52:23.325 - 00:52:56.569, Speaker A: I think from an investor perspective, I think this lesson around navigating Timeframes is probably the most important thing. Right. I think everybody who was around last cycle probably got burnt on some bets they made towards the end of the cycle. Maybe they bought in too much into the hype and then couldn't really differentiate what was hype and what was actual traction. So kind of having that more critical mind, a kind of cynical mind, I think would be helpful. But at the same time, you don't want to be too cynical, right? Because you're in this space because you think it's early, because you believe in its potential. One of the ailments I see in the entire market right now is everybody's so depressed.
00:52:56.569 - 00:53:50.791, Speaker A: Everybody thinks we're going to zero, nobody's coming in. All these use cases are tiny, they're very niche, and the only thing that can lift us up is like, liquidity injection. Even some of the big liquid fund managers. I think someone was bringing up a tweet by liquid fund manager in another podcast recently about how VZs are bad for this space because they're value extracted, which I think really kind of painted a very negative view of development in this space just because, yes, there's a lot of bad VCs that they list tokens at very high value, they sell, they dump on retails and so on. But to say that venture capital as a asset class, as a category is bad for the space, I think basically implies that you think everything that's being funded is a scam. And that's why VCs are only here to fleece people. Because the optimistic look is that, okay, VCs are paying developers to build things that can actually bring in more people.
00:53:50.791 - 00:54:13.915, Speaker A: So the fact that VCs are evil is a consensus view now, I think, underlies a lot of the assumptions that this space is not going anywhere and that people are kind of depressed and their expectations are quite low. So, yeah, I think being perpetually optimistic on a long enough timeframe, but very cynical on a short timeframe was something that I wish I learned many years ago.
00:54:15.735 - 00:54:43.727, Speaker B: Maybe wrapping that into everybody being depressed. Do you think it's been six months of chop? The timeline's going crazy. How are you kind of thinking about this? Is this a kind of 2019 timeframe? Is, again, the analogy uncracked in the next 12 months? Are you optimistic or are you guys changing your asset allocation strategy at all?
00:54:43.871 - 00:55:08.475, Speaker A: I think there's a little bit more urgency this time in that in 2019, the promises haven't really played out. This is before Defi Defi was called Openfi this is before NFTs, before metaverse. So there's a lot of ideas that are around but they haven't been, you know, they haven't been put in the public spotlight yet. Whereas this time we've seen a lot of the use cases from last cycle. Many of them didn't work out. We have some big blowups. So people are way more skeptical and cynical.
00:55:08.475 - 00:55:38.151, Speaker A: And so I think if 2019 was like fear, people didn't know where the space was going. This time is more like apathy. People knew what the excesses of the space could take us to and they're not that interested. They don't really believe it will come back again. So in terms of how we allocate on the venture side, we try not to take a view on six months to a year. We really just betting on founders taking a secular view over the 5, 10 year horizon. And on the liquid side, we kind of take it day by day.
00:55:38.151 - 00:55:40.115, Speaker A: I think that's the best you can do with this market.
00:55:40.735 - 00:56:18.435, Speaker B: And how has I guess being in Asia and Singapore kind of like either shaped or changed your worldview on the crypto markets? Because I think oftentimes the US wrongly assumes that they're the center of the universe in either engineering or finance. But. But the world is broad and a lot of Asia speculators out in this part of the world. How has kind of being out in Singapore changed your outlook on crypto markets or influenced you in any way?
00:56:18.815 - 00:56:59.111, Speaker A: Yeah, if I'm as excessively generalized, I think the average Asia based crypto participant is more commercially minded or cynical than the average American participant that I've interacted interactive with in chats with a lot of American fund managers. They tend to be venture focused, tend to be very long term focus focused on tech. In the Asia circles there's still those people. I like to think that I'm trying to be one of those people. But I think the general participant is more focused on the trading aspect of it, the shorter timeframe, kind of the narrative focused, a little bit more cynical, a little bit more maybe PvP. So that's kind of influenced my thinking as an investor in that. Okay, I don't buy into narratives as easy anymore.
00:56:59.111 - 00:57:17.335, Speaker A: I like to think I'm less gull because I hang around enough people who are cynical as well. But it comes back to the point, right? You need to have that cynicism so that you don't get burnt on you being too late to narratives, but also have the optimism so that you can differentiate what is a narrative and what is actual traction that you want to bet on?
00:57:18.995 - 00:57:33.175, Speaker B: I think perhaps if we summarize the podcast, it's. If it's a hot narrative and you want to trade it, run towards it. If it's something that you want to hold long term and you're kind of playing catch up to the trade and you want to do it long term.
00:57:34.685 - 00:57:45.709, Speaker A: Yeah. So long term bullish, long term optimistic, and short term cynical, I think is probably the way that you maintain your sanity if you're trying to navigate crypto.
00:57:45.797 - 00:57:56.357, Speaker B: I love it. Amazing. I guess perhaps we can wrap it up here. Is there any other topics, specific items you wanted to touch upon?
00:57:56.501 - 00:57:59.911, Speaker A: No, I think that pretty much covers all of it. Cool. Thanks for having me.
00:57:59.983 - 00:58:42.327, Speaker B: No, thank you so much. I think you've been a influence in the crypto sphere for a really long time. Founders say amazing things about Tangent and working with you guys, I think you guys have running both the liquid and venture fund a really nuanced point of view that maybe some people that are too bullish long term aren't cynical enough in the short term. I think that balance is something that you can really only attain by playing the game for as long as you have. And so I thank you for your conversations and your contributions to the space and look forward to following you and Tangent for the next couple decades.
00:58:42.391 - 00:58:43.447, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you very much.
00:58:43.551 - 00:58:44.495, Speaker B: Appreciate it. Thanks, Jason.
