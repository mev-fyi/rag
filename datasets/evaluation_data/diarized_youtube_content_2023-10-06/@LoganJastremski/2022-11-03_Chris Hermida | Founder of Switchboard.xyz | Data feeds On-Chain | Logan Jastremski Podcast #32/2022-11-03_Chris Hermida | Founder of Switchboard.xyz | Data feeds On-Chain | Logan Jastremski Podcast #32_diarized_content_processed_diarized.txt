00:00:02.280 - 00:00:29.530, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Chris, for joining me. Super excited to chat with you. I think you and what your team is building at switchboard is definitely much needed in the space, and I'm kind of excited to, are very excited ultimately, to kind of break down all the details of what makes it work and why ultimately these different ecosystems are going to benefit so much from what your team is building. So thank you again.
00:00:29.910 - 00:00:47.406, Speaker B: Yeah, no, thank you, Logan, for having us on. I think this is our first podcast, which is kind of crazy. We're mostly heads down building. We're a team of builders, so it's cool to finally be able to share that with more people beyond just the highly technical Sol devs and Sol community, as well as aptos and near.
00:00:47.558 - 00:01:07.630, Speaker A: Exactly. Awesome. Well, I would love to start the conversation. I always find it fascinating on how people get into blockchain and crypto. I think everybody's journey is kind of unique. So could you talk about what inspired you to get into the crypto ecosystem and then ultimately how you started to, or why you started switchboard?
00:01:08.250 - 00:01:52.276, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I'd love to. So I've actually been in crypto for a really long time, so discovered bitcoin and sort of other crypto things on the hacker News forums back in call it 2012 2013. Didn't really think it would go anywhere, to be frank, until we started seeing some traction around the idea that you could have bitcoin as a payment mechanism. And to be frank, back then, call it 2013 2014. The idea and even the concept of smart contracts and things being built on top of it was just so abstract and so far away in the future that it wasn't really taken seriously by a lot of people. And I think back then, the predominant thought was, okay, bitcoin can be this global payment mechanism. Was still in college and said, wow, this is actually really cool.
00:01:52.276 - 00:02:40.800, Speaker B: And if this works out, you're not going to necessarily need these traditional fintech vendors for a lot of things. You're going to be able to replace, ideally, most sort of fiat settlement systems with crypto. So at the time, there were two large companies, or I should say three or four, working on these sorts of solutions. Cold emailed all of them, and Jeremy Allaire from Circle got back to me. So was one of the first interns at Circle did a bunch of stuff. When you're at that early stage and you're working on a lot of different things, but join the risk and data science team to help them work on fraud prevention around credit card chargebacks with bitcoin payments, fast forward to call it 2016. And there was quite a big pivot in terms of circle itself to focus more on the retail payment side.
00:02:40.800 - 00:04:09.080, Speaker B: But as part of that, they also reshuffled things and was fortunate enough to join Dan Matachewski from CMS holdings on their trading desk. I think back then people thought that crypto trading would be a thing, but I don't think people realize the extent and the scale and how fast and how big it would ultimately end up getting. So it was fortunate enough to work with him and grow effectively two man shop in Boston to a 24/7 global trading operation. There were lots of other great people there. Ryan Salem, who's now the CEO of FTX Digital Markets, was there with us, as well as a lot of the other CMS holdings folks who have all gone on to do really great, cool things. 2019 left, along with some of the other team members, to run my own capital with another partner named Zach Brush, who currently runs recur forever, was fortunate enough to get involved in the sole ecosystem. And I think, Logan, you probably remember, it was a very tiny, very small community at the time, and it wasn't just about investing, it was, how can you get more involved? How can you build? So teamed up with my co founder Mitch, and really decided, hey, instead of just investing and trading, what valuable infrastructure can we build for the space? Having been part of that trading background, one of the things that always interested me was this idea of derivatives markets on effectively everything.
00:04:09.080 - 00:04:53.918, Speaker B: One of the thought processes around this was, in the future, everything is going to be tradable. You are going to be able to have a derivative or bet or settlement against any sort of arbitrary form of data, and there isn't really a great oracle solution to power that, particularly on Solana at the time. So we said, hey, you know what? If somebody's going to build it, why can't it be us? And just started building. So I think we had a beta on Devnet in three weeks, launched Mainnet in June 2021, then launched our v two in January 2022, and we've just been building ever since. So it's been a really exciting journey for us. But, I mean, the biggest thing for us is, I like to say that there's two types of builders in crypto. There's missionaries and mercenaries.
00:04:53.918 - 00:05:16.308, Speaker B: And I don't mean that in a derogatory way, there's nothing wrong with one path versus the other, but I would definitely say from an ethos perspective, we're very much DeFi idealists wouldn't have joined the space to begin with if I didn't think that this could change the world and our co founders feel the same way. So we've just, it's been a hell of a ride and we're just so excited for everything people are building.
00:05:16.484 - 00:05:52.802, Speaker A: That's amazing story. And I think even kind of one thing that I'm always impressed by a lot of people that I have talked to is just their ability to kind of cold DM or cold email someone and kind of how that kind of sets off a different chain of events in their lives. And so very cool to hear your story. And I the hustle that ultimately got you here and all the cool people that you ultimately met along the way and then ultimately deciding to go back to the building and kind of really kind of contribute to the core ecosystem. So very cool.
00:05:52.986 - 00:06:20.994, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, I think there's one thing that I would love to share with more of the community. It's that, you know, you too can be a builder. I think everybody always thinks that, you know, it's out of reach or you can't do this or you can't do that, or you don't have XYZ expertise. And I think that it's always possible to find a way and find a path to do things. You just have to know what you're good at and what you're not good at and find people to compliment you on those weaknesses. So I'm fortunate enough to have an amazing technical co founder who's helped us build switchboard to where we are here.
00:06:20.994 - 00:06:28.470, Speaker B: But I know many other teams that have done that without that and have built great, huge, successful businesses and projects in the space.
00:06:28.890 - 00:07:01.470, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I fully agree. And one of the reasons ultimately I wanted to start the podcast was to be able to help educate people on a lot of these different one, technical nuances, but ultimately kind of where the space is going and ultimately where it's headed and being able to speak with the people directly, building this space, like yourself, I thought would be a unique window, so I would definitely echo those sentiments. Anybody that wants to get involved in crypto and more broadly, web3, even if you're non technical, don't feel like you're left out.
00:07:01.770 - 00:07:03.668, Speaker B: Yeah, cool.
00:07:03.804 - 00:07:26.440, Speaker A: Well, maybe we diving into a little bit more about switchboard and what you're building there. You touched upon it briefly in the intro, but could you maybe on a high level again explain what switchboard is, what you're doing on the oracle side and then happy to break it down from there?
00:07:27.060 - 00:08:24.020, Speaker B: Yeah, no, totally. And so what we're building with switchboard is a decentralized, permissionless, customizable oracle. And that sounds like a whole load of gibberish. But what we do is we help web3 companies take web two data, or aggregate web two and web3 data together and bring that on chain. So if you are, for example, a derivatives market and you need to reference the price of, say, an underlying spot market, we can help you get price feeds for that, both from on chain and off chain sources and create your own customized feed. Now, we talk a lot about permissionless and customizable, but from our perspective, what that means is we don't take the approach that there is one best way to do something, particularly in the context of an oracle or of a price feed or really of any data bringing off chain to on chain. You have to make certain editorial decisions of what do you want to see.
00:08:24.020 - 00:09:38.090, Speaker B: Many oracle networks make their own, and as part of that, you make trade offs for your users. We've tried to always philosophically take the approach that permissionless finance needs permissionless feeds, but also that means that protocols themselves should be in charge and should control what the data is that they're bringing on chain. So if you don't like a particular price source, you should not be forced to use that or include that on an index to bring it on chain. So that's pretty much the majority of switchboard's focus. I would say that when we were getting started, we definitely thought there would be far more usage outside of what we're calling the long tail of crypto and of data. But what we found is the market is still very focused on DeFi, and that's fine. We love deFi, big idealists, but in terms of usage, predominantly what you've seen with most oracle networks has been focused on 80% deFi use cases, whether that's borrow, lend derivatives, insurance, et cetera, and 20% everything else, whether that's prediction markets, VRFs and gaming and sort of other use cases around that, I think.
00:09:38.090 - 00:09:39.470, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:09:39.630 - 00:10:10.448, Speaker A: No, I think that's kind of a great jumping off point and great summary to start off with. I think, I mean, I would say probably most of my audience is pretty technical and into the weeds on a lot of kind of oracles, but maybe for those that are not and people that are just more broadly interested in kind of understanding what you're building, why are Oracles required? Kind of in the blockchain sense, and I. Yeah, maybe just start there.
00:10:10.624 - 00:11:13.842, Speaker B: Yeah. So, Logan, I'll probably say this from a spicy perspective, which is oracles aren't always required. And I think a lot of people try to force use cases for things where it may not be necessary. But I would say excluding that, if you need to access some web two data, or if you need to aggregate some other form of unstructured data and process that, it's going to be easier to do those types of computations via an oracle network and then bring that on chain. So the easiest sort of example is if you are a derivatives market and you want to make a derivative on say a token that's only traded on a centralized exchange, you can reference that underlying spot price to create an index for the settlement of that said derivative contract. You link that data, especially in terms of this particular use case around DeFi derivatives. You want oracles and you want whatever price mechanism or price feed you're doing to reflect that underlying activity the most.
00:11:13.842 - 00:11:31.980, Speaker B: In some cases that's going to be, say binance or some spot exchange. In other cases it's actually going to be defi. You want to make sure that you're reflecting the majority of where price discovery is actually taking place to make sure that you have an accurate representative feed that you can use for your program and for your particular use case.
00:11:33.200 - 00:11:50.260, Speaker A: Yeah, that totally makes sense. Kind of ultimately just settling the final end state and some of these things instead of every single instance, especially where kind of blockchains are continuing to scale and that throughput can kind of be a scarce commodity.
00:11:50.680 - 00:12:30.320, Speaker B: Yeah, and we say this use case a lot just because that's what we've seen the most on DeFi, but it shouldn't eliminate that. And what I mean is there are other valuable use cases that I don't think have really fully been flushed out that you're going to see continue to expand everything from say dynamic nfts to sort of on chain randomness around gamefi elements, things that you see some traction and adoption in, but that if crypto really takes off as a consumer application and consumer use case should actually dwarf or I from just a user use count be much higher than a lot of the DeFi aspects, but we'll see.
00:12:30.900 - 00:13:00.684, Speaker A: It definitely makes sense. So you mentioned switchboard is focused on the permissionless aspect of building these oracles, but there's different type of oracles. Could you talk about, again, your focus on the decentralized aspect and talk about some of the pros and cons of saying being totally decentralized versus having a more centralized oracle as well?
00:13:00.852 - 00:13:55.744, Speaker B: Totally, yeah. So we like to separate things into first party oracles and third party oracles and what we mean by that is effectively one is an aggregator and one is coming directly from the source. So in layman's terms, imagine if, say, FTX was running their own node and publishing XYZ data on chain themselves. That would be a first party oracle, right? There is a direct relationship between that data provider that is then running some sort of node or software to directly publish that data on chain and skip any intermediary step versus a third party oracle such as switchboard, which is using third party data. Our aggregators and our nodes hit that FTX endpoint and then aggregate that and then bring that on chain. From the end user perspective, there are trade offs for one, by taking the decentralized approach, you do have slightly more latency when bringing that said data on chain. There's no way around that.
00:13:55.744 - 00:14:24.490, Speaker B: If a data source has to go through another intermediate step, it is going to take slightly longer. But in response to that, you get the robustness and security models of a decentralized infrastructure and something that in an ideal world, or better said, in a world where I there are attacks on centralized infrastructure, you have a bit more resilience and a bit more redundancy to protect that core asset or that core price feed or whatever it is that you need or doing to get that said data on chain.
00:14:25.350 - 00:14:58.480, Speaker A: Yeah, that totally makes sense and definitely appreciate the clarity. The robustness I think is definitely needed and will continue to be needed, especially as these systems scale. I think a lot of people kind of forget today how early we are in the lifecycle of these ecosystems. It's funny, kind of even just looking at doing analytics on how many people are actually using a lot of these systems. There's not very many compared to web two. So I'm excited to watch this space scale and kind of the more novel use cases continue to emerge for oracles.
00:14:58.860 - 00:15:35.580, Speaker B: Totally. And the other thing that is really interesting and useful on the permissionless and sort of third party side is it lets you move a lot faster when adding stuff. I think part of the challenge is that you see this, and so the traditional world is having to wait on, say, business development deals to get access to something or to get something through. I think it goes back to that philosophy that permissionless finance needs permissionless feeds. And I hammer that. I say it all the time because it really is. There's a mismatch when you don't have that either in terms of product experience or ability to add new features or other things.
00:15:35.580 - 00:15:56.940, Speaker B: Again, there are trade offs. We're not saying one is better than the other. It's more what is the best thing for your particular need or use case? And again, our perspective as builders isn't to say that one or one thing or one approach is better. It's to say, okay, Logan, you're trying to build Xyz. Can we help?
00:15:57.360 - 00:16:21.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that. I think that's definitely the correct approach. Talking about more holistically, could you talk about specific features of Oracle's and maybe go a little bit, or explain why randomness is important and go into depth on that as well?
00:16:22.170 - 00:17:24.698, Speaker B: Yeah. For context, switchboard created the first verifiable randomness feed and function. Better said on Solana for our listeners, who may not be familiar with that, what it allows is it allows you to prove that some result was actually truly randomly generated using cryptography. So if, say, for example, you had an NFT mint, that the allocation of certain rare features was determined by some randomness function, ideally, you would want that to be provably fair. If you have an on chain casino where, say, the outcome of Hannah blackjack, you want to know that the house is not cheating on you, and a verifiable randomness function allows you to do that. I would say that it was a lot of work from a cryptography perspective to get this through and wanted to give a big shout out to the folks at Sol labs, specifically Larry, who helped us rewrite some really core libraries, to really get that through on chain.
00:17:24.874 - 00:17:37.890, Speaker A: That's amazing. Go ahead. And maybe on a high level, could you talk to some of the difficulties of why creating something that is truly random random is so difficult?
00:17:38.510 - 00:18:42.496, Speaker B: Yeah. So the biggest issue is you have to prove that this result was generated randomly in a tamper proof way, while also ensuring that that result can be read and utilized on chain effectively. So for RVRF, in particular, the oracles, or better said, the end users, supply a seed. That seed is then put into a function on chain, including the block hash, and then that generates a random function, random number that you can prove that the oracle did not tamper and that there was nothing interjecting or interfering with anything there. That result is proven on chain, and then it's called, and programs can use it to then, you know, say, roll a dice or get the result of hand of blackjack. And the biggest component is the fact that those nodes can supply their own seed that is not tampered with, versus solely relying on, say, putting a block hash into drand. If you're doing that, it's kind of the naive approach.
00:18:42.496 - 00:19:14.306, Speaker B: It works for a lot of use cases, but there's always those edge cases where, for example, on Solana, the lead validator, whoever selected for that round could, in theory, compromise or have access or see what that predicted result is. And these are all edge cases. But I think what it goes to is that crypto, and specifically by crypto, I mean, cryptography and security on chain is very difficult. And you want to make sure that you're accounting for those edge cases in many of these different things wherever possible.
00:19:14.498 - 00:19:39.700, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, I mean, especially with all the hacks that we have seen and exploits kind of in crypto, if there's even an edge case that exists, ultimately someone will kind of try to exploit it and find it and kind of be nefarious in that sense. So definitely important that kind of the hatches are bound down in some sense.
00:19:40.520 - 00:20:01.380, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah. And it's funny, but I feel like a lot of the NFT crowd are some of the most vocal on these aspects. And I think if you see what was happening during some of the mints late last year, not particularly on the sole ecosystem, but on other ecosystems, there were a lot of allegations around this.
00:20:02.080 - 00:20:08.180, Speaker A: More like rare nfts kind of being not random and giving to select people.
00:20:08.480 - 00:20:17.718, Speaker B: Right. Or some other ways to sort of manipulate the generation. So we're proud to have a solution that literally makes it impossible to manipulate in that regard.
00:20:17.904 - 00:20:40.114, Speaker A: Awesome. Very cool. And with the oracles, is it pretty similar to ultimately say, like full nodes in consensys? You have multiple different decentralized oracles, kind of placed gerar in different parts of the world.
00:20:40.282 - 00:21:10.200, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. And one thing that separates switchboard is the approach that we take to consensys. We actually have two different, we have this concept of queues. And specifically what we've allowed is we've allowed people to select the security model that they would prefer. So we have a permissionless queue which relies on economic incentives, and then we have a permission queue which relies on trust based incentives. The reason to go that approach is it goes back to our original philosophy, which is some end users prefer one approach versus another.
00:21:10.200 - 00:21:36.538, Speaker B: Our goal is not to make an editorial decision here and say, okay, this is the right solution for everybody, as much as saying, if you need XYZ, we will find a way to build XYZ and support your particular use case. But yeah, to answer your question, geographically distributed nodes who are fulfilling this data on chain, that request is then sent and aggregated as it's pushed on chain. If they're beyond a certain out of bounds, there's a slashing component involved.
00:21:36.714 - 00:21:47.060, Speaker A: Makes sense. Could you talk about your team's choice to build on Solana first versus, like, ethereum?
00:21:47.720 - 00:22:39.482, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of the biggest things of this idea, right, of derivatives on everything that partially really inspired the beginning of switchboard was a lot of transactions are not economic on Ethereum, for obvious reasons. Given sort of all the demand around block space on ETH and their approach to scaling, we've taken the approach that if there is going to be derivatives on chain, there are very good benefits to composability in having an l one. It's not the only approach. You see Dydx that's taking their own DAP chain approach. But in general, there are a lot of benefits to composability within that. You want to make sure that you can cover as many use cases as possible, including low value use cases or low value collateral or low value margin.
00:22:39.482 - 00:23:20.970, Speaker B: That may not seem that interesting at a high level, but enables all these other use cases around the long tail. And when we were looking at chains to build this on and sort of where we think that this activity is going to happen, initially we chose Solana because of where it was from, a scaling approach, because of the amazing community, and because of all the opportunity and growth that we saw there, I would say we are chain agnostic. We're going to build wherever our end users and builders are. We have no favorite child, if you will, but we're really proud to have started on Solana and really excited to scale and continue supporting the community here.
00:23:21.130 - 00:23:36.450, Speaker A: That's awesome. Maybe just continuing on that point. You've recently expanded to multiple chains. Could you talk about why you expanded to the other chains and what drew you to those ecosystems?
00:23:37.070 - 00:24:25.300, Speaker B: Yeah, so it was all developer driven. So it was requests from a lot of folks on the sole ecosystem to say, hey, we're building on aptos. Do you guys plan on expanding there? I think the other aspect is that we want to serve users in every ecosystem, and if there are certain interesting use cases that we can power on other l one s, we want to be able to accommodate that. What I would say is that our approach is very much to be neutral. We want to build on wherever there are going to be builders and legitimate, solid, amazing communities there. And by the way, I'd also add to that we're open to building on Dapp chains and application specific roll ups to meet user needs as well. We're not necessarily married to just l one s, but it's all going to ultimately be driven by developer demand.
00:24:25.300 - 00:24:36.088, Speaker B: So again, we're excited to support apdos and near, but we're also excited to continue supporting Solana as well as other communities we'll be going to in the near future.
00:24:36.224 - 00:24:48.940, Speaker A: I'm curious, just from a developer and engineering point of view on your team, how kind of the rollout or building process has been across those different chains?
00:24:49.370 - 00:25:14.418, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I would say DevOps. DevOps. DevOps is definitely the most difficult challenge to handle in this multi chain world. And again, the challenges that we face are different than the challenges other protocols would face. I like to believe crypto, in an ideal world, everything serverless, you just upload your code to the chain and that's it. You don't have to worry about anything, it just works. Go on your day.
00:25:14.418 - 00:25:42.330, Speaker B: But for Oracle networks, wherever there is very much that web two component, and there is that component of managing node infrastructure in a network. It is a bit more of a DevOps resource challenge and making sure that you can coordinate the node networks, node operators and handle a rollout as you're scaling out and getting progressively more decentralized in every chain. I'm not going to lie, you lose a lot of sleep over it, I'm sure.
00:25:43.540 - 00:25:57.000, Speaker A: So on the DevOps side, scaling that infrastructure, do you have any public numbers on the number of nodes that you're running for each of those different networks?
00:25:57.580 - 00:26:28.830, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have a network stats page that we've published at switchboard XYZ where you can see these stats, I think on Sol, I want to say there's 20 some nodes live right now, but it varies. I mean, anybody can run a node and if you are interested, get in touch. What I would say is that the complexity is going to depend on what you want to do. If you want to support five different networks, that's going to be a lot harder from a node infrastructure and DevOps side than say, supporting just one.
00:26:30.250 - 00:26:59.660, Speaker A: Yeah, totally makes sense. Awesome. Very cool. And then maybe kind of just taking a step back on the oracle fronts, I try to always go a little bit onto the technical sides and how they work, but then always bring it back to the user facing applications. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the awesome user applications that you've seen from projects integrating with switchboard?
00:27:00.100 - 00:27:49.142, Speaker B: Yeah, so some of the coolest stuff that we've seen has been around this idea of permissionless pools that our friends at Solend recently launched. And what that enables is you effectively create a permissionless borrow lend market on any asset and you can create your own switchboard feed. Define it, how you need or how you'd rather see fit and launch a permissionless borrowed lend pool on that. From our side, I like to think that the coolest things that people are going to build are the things we don't know about already. And I don't mean that in terms of just existing use cases, I mean more cool future novel applications that we haven't even thought of. And from the end user perspective, look, we're all in crypto. We all think that this space is going to continue growing as it continues growing.
00:27:49.142 - 00:28:06.180, Speaker B: The general thesis is you're going to have more economic activity that takes place on chain versus off chain. And as a result of that, there's going to need to be more infrastructure to connect both and accommodate more interesting, novel, more specialized use cases as part of that.
00:28:06.520 - 00:28:39.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. I'm curious. Like I'm pretty excited. Just I kind of view and my mind ultimately crypto being like an hourglass in some sense, where like tradfi is on the top and slowly kind of coming to the bottom of the hourglass, which is crypto or web3. How long do you think ultimately it will take for like majority of markets to become like more crypto native on crypto rails?
00:28:40.140 - 00:29:22.140, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think I forget who I made this bet with. Maybe it was Stanford CMS, but you know, it was this thought that. I think it's not crazy to imagine that in the next ten years it's possible to see total crypto volume, including crypto representations of real world assets on chain, eclipsing trad five volume, if you will, and it already has in some markets, but by and large it's still pretty small. When you think of just total crypto activity, total crypto volume, total size of crypto market cap, whatever you want to use as your index compared to, say, tradfi, compared to, say, equities, compared to, say, even FX. It's still relatively tiny in the grand scheme of things.
00:29:23.760 - 00:30:05.232, Speaker A: Yeah, I would totally agree with you and I hope it happens faster as well. I think it's interesting just kind of from our research, just focusing on how these blockchains scale to try to get that mass adoption. But I'm fairly confident it happens as well. And I think it will happen relatively quickly just for how long it took the Internet to scale. Now that we already have a lot of these plumbing and infrastructure built out and a lot of crypto is just fine tuning the software and figuring out which architectures work and what don't, I'm very excited for that liquidity and money to ultimately move to web3, whereas.
00:30:05.376 - 00:30:48.080, Speaker B: Yeah, and look, it's going to depend on a lot of factors, right, beyond just like regulatory environment getting better to the infrastructure, actually being there to scale in certain areas. But I think it's very clear that this is the future in some way, shape or form. It's just. What specifically is that going to look like? The comparison I give to a lot of other crypto folks is the NFT space. And the NFT boom, I think, caught a lot of people off guard. If you look at a lot of people that have been in crypto since the 20 11, 20 12, 20 13, 20 14. I think a lot of those folks didn't expect nfts and the NFT craze and the NFT boom to get to what it is today.
00:30:48.080 - 00:31:27.470, Speaker B: And I think one of the important things is knowing, would you rather, do you want to be right or do you want to make money? If the market speaks a certain way, I think it's very clear that people do value this. This is going to be interesting. This is going to be a large market, and then it's okay. How can you accommodate that? I think it'll be a lot of that similar approach, and it won't necessarily look like nfts, but just more catching people off guard. I think as we grow and as we scale and we get more activity happening in crypto, I definitely agree.
00:31:27.590 - 00:31:54.670, Speaker A: It's been interesting. I was class of 2017, ultimately kind of went through that boom and bust cycle and was investing kind of throughout that bear market. But it became very interesting to me again and like, kind of had the 2017 vibes. Once composability started happening on ethereum and all the yield farming started happening, a lot of food tokens.
00:31:55.650 - 00:31:58.274, Speaker B: So DeFi, what's going to take to take DeFi to the next level?
00:31:58.322 - 00:31:58.966, Speaker A: Yes.
00:31:59.138 - 00:32:29.324, Speaker B: Okay, so back to first principles. I think the issue with a lot of DeFi has been that people are focused very much on just pure speculative use cases versus, and let me not say pure speculative. I mean, Ponzi nautics, right? Like, just, there is not a genuine transfer of risk happening versus. Okay, there are two different people that are coming together to say, I have this risk, I want to offset that. I don't have that risk. I want to earn this return. I think that's attractive.
00:32:29.324 - 00:34:01.860, Speaker B: I want to do that in layman's terms, think of it as just market dynamics in general. A transfer or trade is productive if two people are exchanging risk or two people are exchanging something that they either don't want to have anymore or they want to acquire. Otherwise, how does that work in terms of Defi? How does that go through just all modern finance of where we are here and where we are right now? It's you want to be able to offset certain risk, or you want to be able to buy or sell certain things that you may not have access to. When I think of what DeFi really enables on the permission side, it's interesting to do, borrow, lend, and that's a huge market on its own. But the thing that I'm personally really excited about is defi derivatives on anything allow anybody in the world to speculate or hedge the price of milk, or any sort of other asset, or literally anything with reliable oracle infrastructure. And with these payment rails and settlement rails that you've built using deFi, there's other things as well that kind of plays into an all encompassing type of use case that can be everything from a liquid altcoins to real estate on chain, to all sorts of foreign equities or foreign products, if you will. Literally, there is no limit to what can be done, as much as where's the consumer demand, and how can you build a platform that enables anybody to take advantage of that?
00:34:02.920 - 00:34:15.640, Speaker A: Yeah, that definitely makes sense. On the derivative side, what do you think are the key components there that are needed to actually make a market a decentralized derivative of markets? Successful?
00:34:16.500 - 00:34:54.310, Speaker B: Yeah. So again, there has to be demand to exchange risk on both sides. So one way to think of it is a market's going to be interesting if there are a lot of people that have opposing views. If everybody feels one way about an asset, think about it. It's not really a super interesting market because it's just skewed all over one side. The most interesting markets, the things that have the most flow, the most volume, the most liquidity, the most depth, are things where there are actually diametrically opposing views in terms of risk as to what's happening there, and people are exchanging that, and that's resulting in economic activity. There has to be demand to exchange that said risk in that defi project.
00:34:54.310 - 00:35:44.750, Speaker B: In terms of where I think that is right now, I think it's really cool stuff that, for example, Viper on Sol, what they've done of creating permissionless OTC drives and allowing anybody to do a forward contract on any supported asset, call it 100 plus different things. I think you'll see a lot more of that going forward where somebody has XYZ position, they want to hedge that risk. They can go to Viper, or they can go to a desk, or they can use defi derivs to get out of the other side of it. It'll probably expand like that and then grow from there. The other component of that, I think, is also insurance. When you think about what insurance is, it's just an outright transfer of risk, saying, I'm okay owning that risk of a hurricane hitting your house, but you are not. So I'll buy hurricane insurance, or you'd be selling hurricane insurance, the other person would be buying.
00:35:44.750 - 00:35:56.970, Speaker B: But you get the idea of what that flow looks like and how to scale it. That scaling that is just ultimately going to depend on reliable oracle infrastructure for that particular use case, and then market demand.
00:35:58.070 - 00:36:17.850, Speaker A: I wanted to jump back to one thing that you said earlier with the fact that of what benefits ultimately composability can kind of play in the ecosystem. Could you go a little bit more into depth on kind of all the pros that you're seeing on the composability side?
00:36:18.270 - 00:37:13.420, Speaker B: Yeah. So the biggest thing is around margining and collateral, right? It's not just collateral type supported, it's also the idea of cross chain margining, or better said, not cross chain cross margining on that said chain, different types of risk. So, for example, if you are long ETH and short bitcoin, that is a less risky position than just being long bitcoin and long ETH for the same amount of notionals. Just because of the correlations and the function of the way this risk works. Having on chain margining, like what you've seen with and there's multiple teams working on this, really unlocks and enables a lot more interesting use cases and lets you build a better product. The comparison of this, and I always like to give this, one of the reasons why FTX took off, wasn't necessarily liquidity. Don't get me wrong, liquidity was good.
00:37:13.420 - 00:37:58.850, Speaker B: Sam, if you're listening, you've done a great job. But it was a lot of just supporting these new feeds with also supporting new types of collateral fast and having a system and a risk engine that at the time was a lot better than the alternatives. I think what you'll see is people create similar things on Defi. You've already seen a lot of it. I think Mango has done a phenomenal job from an engineering perspective as well as from an execution perspective, despite everything that happened on this. And I think that you're going to see more and more iteration around it to support more interesting, novel use cases where if you want to go long, the price of XYZ against the price of something else. You're going to be able to do that using Defi derivs.
00:37:59.590 - 00:38:28.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm super excited to watch it all play out. I'm personally a very big fan of composability and kind of everything that you can do on a single shard. I think a lot of people underestimate it just because it's so early in the general ecosystem lifecycle and applications that have started to compose that people don't really understand the full power of it today. It's cool to hear it, in your words.
00:38:29.100 - 00:39:26.134, Speaker B: Yeah. From the end user perspective, it just enables a better protocol. From a derivatives perspective, there's other use cases that can also be interesting on that, but particularly on the DeFi perspective, there are really good benefits that come with that. It's not just cross margining one versus another within the same platform, it's also supporting other platforms in this universal, composable way. To the point where, for example, if you were, say, long bitcoin in an ideal world, what we'll see on Sol is if you're long bitcoin on, say, mango and say you're short eth on, say, drift, you'll actually have a marginal system that handles both. And again, there are people trying to work on these sorts of solutions, but I think really that's the dream, is universal cross margin and cross collateral across everything in that shared state shard or l one.
00:39:26.262 - 00:39:50.360, Speaker A: The fact that it's possible is super cool and something that I'm very excited for. Sam, kind of switching gears a little bit. I think your background was kind of unique, getting into or starting at circle and then ultimately kind of joining CMS and then being more on the. Oh, sorry.
00:39:50.440 - 00:39:55.576, Speaker B: Yeah, no, just to clarify, we were on the trading team together at Circle.
00:39:55.648 - 00:39:57.620, Speaker A: At Circle. Apologies.
00:39:58.520 - 00:39:59.780, Speaker B: They are investors, though.
00:40:00.640 - 00:40:06.504, Speaker A: But you ultimately, did you spin up your own investing fund?
00:40:06.672 - 00:40:21.560, Speaker B: Yeah, so we do. So I also run an investment fund with my business partner, Zach Brush of Recur Mana. So we've invested in a number of deals in both the sole ecosystem and more primarily on DeFi as well as NFT use cases. But we're generalized. Go ahead.
00:40:21.640 - 00:40:44.270, Speaker A: So, going from circle to kind of doing your own fund and then ultimately going back to like building. How has kind of each. What have you kind of learned in each of those transitioned? And then ultimately. I'm super curious now how it is and what you've learned kind of as running an organization or protocol, kind of building your product.
00:40:45.250 - 00:41:38.080, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the biggest thing just in general, and shifting gears and seeing a lot of different contexts, a broadened digital horizons, and you kind of see a how the sausage is made, but also you get to experience different types, aspects of the industry and see wherever you have an edge and are able to contribute. I think probably the biggest thing is knowing when your edge goes away. And that was actually a pretty tough conversation that I had with myself and other folks on the trading side, the crypto market changed quite a bit from 2017 to 2021. Of the biggest things is a lot of the easy arbs and easy opportunities that made a ton of money started closing up. You saw a lot more of an efficient algorithmic market. The OTC markets that we were trading and quoting at circle in 2017 that Cumberland was doing in the same era.
00:41:38.080 - 00:42:06.030, Speaker B: The rise of spread compression of the electronic traders of the HFTs and other folks that came into the industry really compressed spreads and made it a lot harder to make money doing that unless you had economies of scale. So that game changed. It's not to say that it's impossible, it's just the edge. And the opportunity was not there anymore, and there was more opportunity, both investing in a longer term timeframe, as was building.
00:42:07.170 - 00:42:21.520, Speaker A: That totally makes sense from learning when you've either lost your edge or that's depleting. How is that transitioned into some of the things and how you approach building a team or building switchboard?
00:42:22.100 - 00:43:07.570, Speaker B: Well, I don't think it's depleting. I just think it's. You have to have the honesty with yourself of knowing. Okay, is that working? To the extent it was, it's just the returns from pure, for example, like pure OTC trading went down because the spreads compressed, and it just was not the same opportunity that it used to be. Again, it's more recognizing things than anything else, but moving to it. No, I think some of the coolest stuff that's happening in crypto and in Defi are these sort of ideals and these visions that people are now building and making a reality here. Having been in the industry for a while and having seen people do that, it was really, we have one opportunity while we're here.
00:43:07.570 - 00:43:33.380, Speaker B: We want to make and build really cool things, and we want to do things that enable these really interesting use cases around permissionless finance. My thinking was very much, I want to see this built. Other people are not building this. Why can that not be me? Why can't that be us and our network and other folks that we know and get people who really support the mission and want to go down that path?
00:43:33.570 - 00:44:07.800, Speaker A: Definitely, totally makes sense. Yeah, I'm always super fascinated just by people's journeys. I always think, looking back on it, everybody's like, oh, yes, what you did in hindsight was very easy and I would have done the same decisions. But at the point in time when you're trying to make a lot of those decisions, you've been trying to email different CEO's on circle, for example. It's very non obvious. So I always applaud people that take those risks and it's not always easy.
00:44:08.980 - 00:45:00.160, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the bigger risks are taken by a lot of the pioneers in other parts of the industry. And as much as you might think that I took risks doing that, it didn't feel like that. I can assure you that Jeremy O'Leary took a lot more risk starting circle to begin with and pursuing USDC in the way that they've grown and built that than I did at that point in time. And it varies. Right. But I would say that it's not necessarily trying to take unnecessary risk as much as given the toolset and skills and infra that you may have or the access that you may have, how can you build something cool and interesting with that? And how can you utilize your skills to the most to help your community, help your users, and ultimately, hopefully build something that really does change the world?
00:45:00.820 - 00:45:20.422, Speaker A: I fully agree. Moving forward on kind of like switchboard standpoint, what are the things that you and your team are kind of grinding away on internally that you're looking forward to ship or some novel things that you're excited about that builders are kind of building, or that you would like to have them build with switchboard.
00:45:20.596 - 00:46:11.190, Speaker B: Yeah. So one of the coolest things that we're working on is our v three. And one of the complaints we get is the gas fees are too high. I mean, again, it's more just the design and nature of a lot of the ecosystems we're on. But the big thing we want to do is we can say, okay, what sorts of efficiencies can we do to where you can have a five to ten x improvement of on chain computation and what it takes to bring that set off chain data on chain. So we're working on an entirely new consensus mechanism that we think is really going to revolutionize the space. But more importantly for our end users, which end of day is what we care about, it's going to let them bring data on chain about five to ten x cheaper than their existing cost, depending on the chain that they're on, while also giving them more access and abilities to create more unique customizable data.
00:46:11.190 - 00:46:28.622, Speaker B: And the permissionless aspect is not going away. It's going to get better and it's going to expand. But we also recognize that decentralization comes at economic costs. So how can we use technology, how can we use cryptography to build much cheaper, better solutions for our end users?
00:46:28.806 - 00:46:32.930, Speaker A: What's the most expensive chain to switchboard on today?
00:46:34.990 - 00:47:24.232, Speaker B: It's going to depend on exactly what you're trying to do. I know that's a cop out, but it really depends on the type of calculation that you want on chain, the activity, how often you want it refreshed, et cetera, et cetera, without knowing that it's tough. But in general, this second out of the three chains are live on Mainnet. Sol is the cheapest, followed by Aptos and near. But again, it depends on the calculation. It's not a one for one comparison. For example, if you're a only updating a feed at every 1% price change, that's going to be cheap on all chains, right? Versus if you're updating everything every 5 seconds, that's going to be much more expensive regardless of the chain you're on.
00:47:24.376 - 00:47:35.180, Speaker A: Definitely. Yeah. I mean, I'd be curious ultimately how expensive it would be on Ethereum. I know that you guys are not live on Ethereum, but those gas costs are just a little crazy.
00:47:35.720 - 00:48:01.668, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think any of the chains where block space is high in demand, it's not going to be cheap. But the question is how can you minimize on chain activity to make it cheap without giving up decentralization and without giving up some of these other benefits of being a permissionless network? That's what we're focused on. Although I would say that we are not on eth yet. Maybe in the future.
00:48:01.804 - 00:48:20.050, Speaker A: Nice, nice. Very cool. It is impressive, I think, ultimately pushing this space forward, enabling new applications, helping with the composability aspect, ultimately expanding to different chains. Your team has a lot on your hands.
00:48:20.990 - 00:48:46.940, Speaker B: We do, but end of day we're focused on just helping our users and that's the biggest thing that we take is we take the feedback of our end users extremely seriously and we want to make sure we can accommodate their use case no matter what it is. And our ethos has always been much more of helping the greater community, not just Sol, but on other chains, than necessarily trying to optimize for ourselves or for switchboard.
00:48:47.720 - 00:49:08.830, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. It's fun to follow along from a distance and see you guys progress. Ultimately, how big is the team? Are you guys looking to expand going forward, what are you kind of looking for from that front?
00:49:09.250 - 00:49:18.074, Speaker B: Yeah, so we'll have a lot of announcements soon. We have about ten contributors right now, but we're going to have a lot more to share very soon on the expansion front.
00:49:18.162 - 00:49:22.070, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Is that going to be an update at breakpoint?
00:49:22.930 - 00:49:24.786, Speaker B: Hope so. That's the goal.
00:49:24.898 - 00:49:36.212, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Awesome. Anybody who wants to get in touch with you or your team or even integrate with switchboard, what is the best way to do so?
00:49:36.396 - 00:49:58.142, Speaker B: Yeah, so you can follow us on twitterwitchboardxyz. Feel free to dm us there or reach out on Discord or Telegram. We try to always be available and you can check out our docs at docs switchboard xyz if you want to get started and start building. We also have some content on YouTube beyond Logan, this podcast, but we'll be doing a lot more soon.
00:49:58.246 - 00:50:31.488, Speaker A: Cool, perfect. And then I try to end the podcast with spicy takes. My go to question has been kind of across the board. I've been asking people the same question just to see the responses, but the latest one has been what ecosystem, like layer one or L2? Have you been enjoying or like find that they do things like uniquely well? And then what ecosystem have you found that is either taking the wrong direction or that you just don't think is going to make it?
00:50:31.664 - 00:50:34.248, Speaker B: Oh man, you're making me so, you.
00:50:34.264 - 00:50:35.616, Speaker A: Know, I gotta try.
00:50:35.808 - 00:51:34.200, Speaker B: I know. Well, so look, you know, what I'll say is we love all our children equally. We do not bias or favor one chain or one implementation over another. What I would say is that there are a lot of l one s that are really focused on interesting use cases that are hyper specific and then there are others that I think are trying to do everything at the same time and as a result are not doing anything well. I don't want to name names, but I think in this world where you have an abundance of block space and you see new l one s and new l two s launching every single day, every single month, I think the value is very much going to be in specialization and in focusing and building an amazing tool for some particular use case versus trying to focus on generalized outcomes. But that's not to say that there isn't room. I always like to say that people ask, what's the next eth? Well, I always say the next eth hasn't been created yet, so we'll see.
00:51:34.200 - 00:51:36.472, Speaker B: But we love all our children equally.
00:51:36.536 - 00:51:45.310, Speaker A: We love all chains, no favorites or maybe even properties. Properties that you think are useful, that you admire in some ways.
00:51:46.050 - 00:52:01.110, Speaker B: There are use cases. There are different tools for different use cases is what I would go for. And some are optimized for different things. Some are optimized for fewer use cases.
00:52:01.810 - 00:52:13.840, Speaker A: Okay, cool. I really kind of appreciate the chat. Chris, is there anything else that we didn't kind of touch upon that you would love to kind of get out here at the end?
00:52:15.140 - 00:52:20.880, Speaker B: I think you touched on a lot of points, Logan. Definitely enjoy the spicy takes.
00:52:21.700 - 00:52:41.328, Speaker A: I got to throw them in there. I got to at least try. Yeah, but no. Thank you. Again, Chris, really enjoyed the chat. Excited for what you are doing for the web3 system, more broadly, what you're building, kind of continuing the permissionless ethos and pushing the space forward. Appreciate your time.
00:52:41.504 - 00:52:47.864, Speaker B: Thank you. And likewise, Logan. Thank you for having me and really excited to see what frictionless is, what round you guys are going to lead next.
00:52:47.952 - 00:52:56.416, Speaker A: Thank you. We got lots of spicy takes. I try to hold back on the yes. Awesome. Yes.
00:52:56.528 - 00:52:57.320, Speaker B: All right, see you. Bye.
