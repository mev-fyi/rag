00:00:00.200 - 00:00:39.230, Speaker A: Up until six months ago, markets still weren't great. Product was doing maybe ten to 20 million in volume a day. Still very early for us, but we still had a lot of conviction that we were building the right thing. We think that trading is crypto's largest use case today, and that's what we wanted to focus on from the start and really optimize for user experience, which is what led into SWE, and we'll get into that a little bit later. And now we're, you know, know, we had a lot of conviction in the product. And since things picked up, especially in November, December, trading on average over $100 million a day, traded 500 million yesterday and about 4 billion in the last 30 days.
00:00:43.170 - 00:01:00.030, Speaker B: Gentlemen, today, super excited to have you both on. Thank you so much for joining me. You're actually my first podcast within a SWE application or the SWE ecosystem. So super excited to have each of you on and thanks for joining me today.
00:01:01.730 - 00:01:04.990, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to be here. Thanks for having us on.
00:01:06.050 - 00:01:28.020, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, maybe just you guys are each the co founders of Bluefin. I would love for you guys each to do just a quick introduction, this being your first podcast. One just about yourself, a little bit about your journey, and then secondly sharing more about Bluefin and a little bit of the inspiration behind building a product.
00:01:29.920 - 00:01:51.216, Speaker C: Nice. I'll get started. So I'll do a quick. My journey into web3 and Bluefin. Really, it's, you know, it's, I think out of college I was working as a software engineer in SF, and it's a pretty, it's a good life, I'd say. It's very comfortable. That's how I describe it.
00:01:51.216 - 00:02:19.900, Speaker C: And I was just looking for to do more, I think more injuring challenges, more technical problems. And that's where web3 really started captivating me. Kind of loosely following along for a while before eventually in late 2020, early 2021. That's around the time period when Bluefin started. Reveal reached out to me and just working on weekend projects. And at some point, in a way, I think the world just kind of conspires to make things happen. And that weekend project turned into pre seed funding.
00:02:19.900 - 00:02:52.060, Speaker C: And I was like, oh shit, this is it. And that was a pretty hard choice because when I chose that kind of to make that leap, I had to give up my visa and stuff because I was working in the US under HMV. But it was, I got a lot of advice. It was like, risk to reward ratio is higher in life than ever before. You know, if you're going to take a bet on something like, do it now and honestly don't regret it. It's been an incredible amount of learning. If I was growing linearly, it's not like, exponential, a lot of mistakes, but, like, that's how you learn at the end of the day.
00:02:52.800 - 00:02:55.300, Speaker B: And you guys are actually brothers, aren't you?
00:02:56.080 - 00:03:05.580, Speaker C: Yeah, that is true. We go way back, so it was. It's funny, we actually, I think, know each other better now than we ever did before we started building a company.
00:03:05.880 - 00:03:25.140, Speaker B: How has that process been just working together as brothers, building a company together? Because, to your point, I do think you guys know each other's how you guys, your strengths, your weaknesses, and possibly works better as, like, a co founding pair than people that are just coming together for the first time.
00:03:26.920 - 00:03:42.860, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one piece that works really well is age, is an engineer. My background is in physics, but now I lead a lot of the business efforts, and I think we just trust each other to own their areas really well together. And I think that synergy is just beautiful.
00:03:44.130 - 00:03:59.470, Speaker B: Yeah. I look for you to give a quick background on yourself. Physics, I very much have appreciated. I kind of went down the nerd route as well with cs. But if I were to go back, I may do physics just because, I don't know, it gives you a good understanding of the world.
00:04:00.290 - 00:04:18.456, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. But I think if I did things over, I'd do Cs. I think physics is so theoretical, but cs is so practical. You can use what you built. But, yeah, just to zoom back, my background's in physics. I studied at Penn. I was part of this energy research program where we're trying to solve the world's energy crisis.
00:04:18.456 - 00:04:55.790, Speaker A: I was doing three degrees at that time, two undergrads and a master's, and really just trying to come up with ways to address the energy problem. And after college, spent a little time working on that, too. But I always wanted to build something of my own. And I felt the impact missing in the near term on that front. And at that time, found someone that I was studying physics with, reached out to AJ, AJ prod on someone he was studying at Berkeley with. And that's really kind of how the initial team was formed, largely within network. I think after that, there was a lot of mistakes, many non linear years.
00:04:55.790 - 00:05:38.542, Speaker A: Even last year, we had two rounds of layoffs. But I think things picked up after we raised our series a. That was with a couple of leading firms like Sig, Brevin, Howard Tower. And even then, I think up until six months ago, markets still weren't great product was doing maybe ten to 20 million in volume a day. Still very early for us, but we still had a lot of conviction that we were building the right thing. We think that trading is crypto's largest use case today, and that's what we wanted to focus on from the start and really optimize for user experience, which is what led into Swe, and we'll get into that a little bit later. And now we're, you know, you know, we had a lot of conviction in the product.
00:05:38.542 - 00:05:49.090, Speaker A: And since things picked up, especially in November, December, trading on average over $100 million a day, traded 500 mill yesterday and about 4 billion in the last 30 days.
00:05:49.630 - 00:06:28.900, Speaker B: That's amazing. And no, I appreciate each of your journeys. I always find it fascinating how people arrive at the certain destination that they do. And I mean, to most people, it just once you hit some level of success, whether it's kind of like an arbitrary amount, whether it's like getting backed by a vc or raising a certain money, like, people are like, oh, I always knew that they were going to do well and going to kill it. But no one really sees the trials and tribulations and the risks that everybody took to get to this point. So kudos to each of you, I know, particularly building within the high throughput ecosystems. I mean, even today, I would say it's still not popular.
00:06:28.900 - 00:06:59.640, Speaker B: And I think I'm extremely excited about all the builders that are building in the high throughput ecosystems because of the applications that they actually enable and the ability to actually scale. So I would love for either or review to speak to maybe before swe, before getting into kind of some more technical nuance, just sharing what bluefin is, in your words, why build this trading product? And what problem are you looking to solve?
00:07:00.980 - 00:07:33.440, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I think the problem we're trying to solve is the on chain user experience for trading. We think that's something that's been missing since we started, and we think it's a bit better today, but it's still lacking. And we do think being in web3 trading will move on chain. It's just a function of time. And that's when we were choosing a platform as like which blockchain can enable us to build a user experience that can compete with that of binance. And that's not only just high throughput, it's also account abstraction and the user experience holistically.
00:07:33.440 - 00:08:14.440, Speaker A: So it's really, that's what we're trying to solve for. And there's two pieces of user experience. There's the retail user experience that's super important. It's the front end, the onboarding, the bridging, the on ramping, the time to, you know, settle trades. But I think equally as important, it's the institutional user experience, because you need to have that liquidity, you need to have those tight spreads and the depth and the number of markets we're trying to optimize for both at the same time, and sometimes that can be a bit difficult, but it really needs to come at no trade offs. And that's really why we chose to build Hunsuite today and kind of what's led to some of the success we're seeing right now. An early stage in terms of where we're going from now.
00:08:15.140 - 00:09:22.264, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely agree. It's very important to segment kind of your user base by retail versus institutional clients. And I think one thing that I've seen just as crypto, as more kind of native Silicon Valley engineers come in, they come with this great product mindset of like, all right, this product is built for this specific segment instead of just like this is going to be for everybody, which honestly, I think is very, very refreshing because if you really build for everybody, at the end of the day, you're building for no one. So refreshing to hear one thing that you ultimately mentioned there was, you think on trading is inevitable. I tend to agree, but there's a lot of skeptics out there saying central limit order books are always going to be slower, have higher latency, and not as effective for price discovery being on chain just because they're purely decentralized than their more centralized counterparts. What would you kind of say to the critics that are not optimistic as you are on trading experiences?
00:09:22.432 - 00:09:54.740, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I think we can get into the order book part. AJ can get into it. But I think there's one huge advantage of being on chain, even if your order book is off chain, which is that it's non custodial. Something like, you know, what happened with FTX and others in the past won't happen when you're on chain because your assets are collateralized on the chain and, you know, a user self custodies their assets. Let's say that's one huge advantage already on top of centralized counterparts. Then I'll let AJ go a little bit into our order book design and our thoughts there.
00:09:56.040 - 00:10:16.640, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I mean, on what you. I think it's a spectrum. I don't. I think our position has been not to take a maximalist approach here and say, you know, like on general order book from day one. Practically all the reasons you listed prevent that from happening today. You like, as soon as you talk to your users, like in our case, like for the order book, it's the market maker.
00:10:16.640 - 00:10:40.436, Speaker C: They will not quote within the bips you want them to. They're going to go really wide. They struggle with cancellations, all these things. On most of the on chain clubs, limit order books tried. And so our practical approach to this for now has been, okay, let's guarantee non custodialness. Let's design the order book. In our case, the matching algorithm is off chain, but we built it in a way where you can still, if you remove it, still place your orders and execute them on chain.
00:10:40.436 - 00:11:15.958, Speaker C: So we've taken this kind of approach while in the back, you know, like 20% of our capacity is always thinking about this problem. How do we bring this on chain? And it's still very much an R and D, but I think eventually the space will get there. It's constantly innovating from what existed four years ago versus today. There's a lot more through the spare market, so many teams built. I think Swee is one great example. There's many, many, many others, and I think that's just going to continue to happen in the web feed space. And eventually those are the kind of innovation that will allow us to bring that kind of experience on chain as well.
00:11:16.134 - 00:11:59.310, Speaker B: 100%. I'm very much aligned with that vision, I think. I mean, personally, I kind of describe the early iterations of blockchain networks as dial up, and then you kind of progress to broadband and then fiber optics. And when you unlock more throughput, you can minimize that latency. When you can reduce finality, there's just a whole new sandbox that engineers ultimately get unlocked because you can do more interesting things. And I think to your point, AJ, it is relatively niche and really all these high throughput ecosystems. But I think why I'm personally excited is because there's a very clear path towards scalability and doing more and more things on chain over time.
00:11:59.310 - 00:12:28.750, Speaker B: I think we do have some progress or a road to walk to get there, but at least to me it seems viable and maybe like the end state where you think bluefin is going to. If you could paint a brushstroke, what would you like that product experience to look like? Just have everything on chain. Have most of tradfi trading on Bluefin, paint that in state picture for us.
00:12:29.250 - 00:13:02.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it looks very much like the user experience in binance today, but it's quicker to onboard and you can use Google Auth. In fact, you'll be able to use Google Auth to use the whole platform in about a week or two. On Bluefin, you don't even need to download wallets. And really what that picture looks like is that of a Robin Hood, of a binance. And it's super easy for users to use. Users don't even need to know which blockchain it's on, and they don't need to, you know, take risk with their assets, you know, with a third party custodian.
00:13:04.510 - 00:14:11.990, Speaker B: Yeah, the third party aspect, it is very important, especially just in terms of everything that happened post FTX. I am very curious to see whether we, like, come up with a hybrid system or if everything will truly be on chain in a verifiable way, because it makes me so sad just how far that set back the industry. I'm sure it set back you guys, being in that high throughput, blockchain space. I mean, I think it disproportionately hurt kind of the non EVM ecosystems more, but it was a challenge. Can you maybe talk just as a personal level and on a building level, you guys, this is not like something you guys did overnight to get to hundreds of millions of volume. You've been at this for some time. Can you talk about, like, your guys inception together? Uh, and really that journey that got you to here today on the product level, at the company level, at the bluefin level.
00:14:13.210 - 00:14:44.418, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot to dissect there because you. I think you were very correct. And there's the product, and there's the company and the team building and the morale, especially through that bear market. It was, I think there was many things that were in play here. I'll take an early stab and raps you can add on. So we started this, as I was mentioning earlier, in late 2020, early 2021, this is middle of the bull run. At that time, there was this incredible kind of interest in the market, but accordingly, this incredible pressure to get to market as fast as possible.
00:14:44.418 - 00:15:35.696, Speaker C: And you combine that with being due to web3, as all of us pretty much, and then in my case, also being pretty new to the fintech world, it can lead to, or it did lead to many, let's say, rash decisions. I think we put out a product, it wasn't the best product. And really, what just followed that was this massive bear market where there's been a few years of just, you know, very quiet. And in hindsight, I think this was the game changer. For us, we were one of those teams that just kept our heads down, preserved Runway and kept building. And here there was, you know, we went live, there was the product still kind of had to get battle tested as different market makers came on. You're understanding what that kind of customer is, the hedge fund user, that wants, like, incredibly low ancs.
00:15:35.696 - 00:16:11.470, Speaker C: Not a single order can, you know, like, split out. They want. If you go down for like an hour, let's say you went down, you had a release for like a minute overnight. Like, if they were not informed, it's upsetting to them. And you really have to go through all these firefights before you. In our case, at least, before we built something that was a lot more resilient, a lot more higher quality. And coming into the tail end of this year, that put us into the position that we were where the product was a lot more resilient, it was tolerant of being able to scale, etcetera.
00:16:11.470 - 00:16:17.690, Speaker C: I'll let rabs also talk a bit about the company journey through this period, because that was also definitely one of the bigger challenges.
00:16:18.000 - 00:16:49.098, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think in general, as a company, we focus on a few things that are really important to us. One is just working with good people. I think if you just enjoy the people at a personal level who you work with, times are going to be tough, shit's going to happen, but you're just going to get through it and you're going to laugh after work one day, or just much more fun to work together. And then I think me and AJ are maybe. I don't know how we're wired in a way where we just never give up. I think it's something her dad used to say, too. It's, you know, you only lose if you give up.
00:16:49.098 - 00:17:13.240, Speaker A: That's literally the only possible way to lose. And we just don't give up. And that's why we won't lose. And that's been our mentality. So there's going to be tough days, there's going to be a lot of firefights, it's going to be many nonlinear years, but we're going to wake up each morning, be super excited, and come to work with that energy. And I think building through the bear market with that mindset really helped us. Um, and then when things picked up in November.
00:17:13.240 - 00:17:16.420, Speaker A: Right. We were well positioned to start taking advantage of that.
00:17:17.200 - 00:17:51.144, Speaker B: Yeah, it kind of gave me a little bit of goosebumps because it just reminded me of all the painful process that I had to do to set up frictionless capital uh, going through the bear market. It's your point. You're kind of in cockroach mode, uh, like, 99% of the time. And then there's these very non linear days where you're just like, wow. A lot of it's coming together. And I think it's kind of the Mark Andreessen saying that there's two main kind of feelings for an entrepreneur. It's euphoria and terror, and lack of sleep enhances those both.
00:17:51.272 - 00:18:01.816, Speaker C: And so I'm sure volatility is like, it takes a toll on you. That's probably the biggest thing I learned, is you got to just learn how to balance and live somewhere in that middle.
00:18:01.968 - 00:18:47.760, Speaker B: It is hard. I'm still trying to figure it out myself. There's a lot of high highs and low lows, but maybe so. And thank you for all the background contacts. I think you guys are really. Why I'm excited to talk to you is not only that you guys grind it out through the bear market, you're really, I would say, one of the first, like, large ecosystem projects built in SwE. A lot of VC's, a lot of naysayers, so to speak, are, in my mind already discounting SWE, saying it's a VC chain, saying instead, to me, it's kind of comical just because they said the same thing about Solana in the early days, that it was a lot of copy projects of Ethereum.
00:18:47.760 - 00:18:56.060, Speaker B: Can you address why you guys were uniquely excited about the sui ecosystem and why you guys decided to build there?
00:18:57.360 - 00:19:30.016, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'll kind of, I'll share a story of how we ended up on SWE, because the story did start earlier for us. This is, you know, when we first entered the space, EVM and solidity in general was a lot more accessible in terms of developer resources, in terms of other open source code bases to learn from. And that's what we started with. We built a EVM based exchange, and we took it live on Arbitrum. This is. We were doing all right. It was ten to 20 million in, I think, daily volume.
00:19:30.016 - 00:20:32.270, Speaker C: But what we really, we learned a lot. I'd say, from that experience, there was gas costs were really high. So that was a big challenge on user acquisition, and we would consider things like subsidizing them, but then that would be pretty expensive on our own burn. And so, because, I mean, there were days gas was going well beyond ten cents, and that was the average, which is when you combine over many trades, that's pretty expensive. So there was that, there was scenarios like, I remember when the arbitrum airdrop happened, network pretty much went down and all our trades were reverting, and there were other kinds of times where blips like that would happen. I think the more experienced teams knew to anticipate that a bit and had these mechanisms that would queue up from dash and then put them later and ameliorate that user experience a little bit. For us, as we were learning these things and thinking now towards building the next version of our exchange, one of the things we started discussing is, okay, is evm the right place to be? And from here we started doing some research.
00:20:32.270 - 00:21:17.488, Speaker C: I think we looked at l two s, especially kind of these custom l two options that existed. We looked at, and then second, we looked at these parallel execution blockchains. Once we started looking deeper there, I think with custom l two s, I think they're viable option. They're super, very cheap in terms of gas from the user experience point of view, we learned that, or we at least saw this model where users will come to the exchange as long as you can have a good user experience. But there are still pretty big concerns around asecurity. I think at that time I saw a lot of bridge hacks happening, and all positions are collateralized by one asset on our exchange. And if that asset itself loses value, then effectively all positions have lost value.
00:21:17.488 - 00:21:49.652, Speaker C: So it would be a catastrophic kind of event for us. There's composability issues you don't really have. There's not much you can, I mean, somebody else would have to come and develop over there, and that's not your main focus. So, you know, that's where l two s eventually is not something we considered. And then coming into words, looking at solana, sui, aptos, etcetera, we started simple. This, okay, benchmarking, we know throughput matters, we know trades matter, speed, latencies matter, and we, I think we had those metrics and things. We was good, Aptos was good, etcetera.
00:21:49.652 - 00:22:25.146, Speaker C: And then from there, there was an element of people, we started talking to the actual teams. And I think that was definitely one of the big conviction points around. When we started chatting with the mistin team, I think the answers I would ask, I wouldn't have non answers, I wouldn't have just some random person. I actually had Sam, the CTO, go in and have these long thread responses and we would kind of geek out. Nothing necessarily geek out, I guess just learn more about things. But he was definitely geeking out and how passionate he was about what he was explaining. And here we learned many things.
00:22:25.146 - 00:23:02.200, Speaker C: There was a ZK login, which has actually now come out, and something we're taking live within the next week. This very much aligned with our vision of abstracting away the challenges of web3 from our users. There's things. And then I think fast forwarding today, there's many more reasons now that I feel more bullish about it around things I've learned about the move language, the things that enables. But at that time, really, how. That's how that decision formed, where we saw the base level things we wanted, low gas costs, high throughput, we saw an alignment in their vision and ours. And see, I think their team kind of stood out to us and what their engineering team stood out to us and what they were building.
00:23:03.260 - 00:23:05.244, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:23:05.372 - 00:23:55.730, Speaker A: And I guess, just to add to that, I remember seeing a podcast, a very early one, with Evan and I, another one of their founders, I don't remember who, and he was just talking about building a blockchain with no trade offs. And that is something that we were trying to do, is, like, build an exchange for trading assets without trade offs, no user experience trade offs, no performance trade offs. And I think after that, it was like, hey, how authentic or true do we think this vision is? And that's really when we started talking to the team, the engineering team specifically, we were just inspired, like, oh, shit. I actually think they can achieve this. I think they already have a great product, and they have the right vision to get to what we want. And it was really a function of hearing that vision on a podcast from the founder to just speaking to the engineering team and being confident that these guys will be able to achieve it.
00:23:56.870 - 00:25:12.902, Speaker B: Yeah, I think as a founder, I mean, you have to paint that beautiful vision and ambitious vision, because if it's not crazy enough, you won't convince enough people to join you on that vision, but you ultimately have to be rooted in reality to say, is this possible? And that dichotomy is often hard. But I love. I really love the mistin team. I think they're. Sam in particular, I've really enjoyed my conversations with him. And to your point, AJ, I had a lot of long conversations just debating the technical merits of how blockchains work. What actually should that kind of look like from a user perspective and developer perspective? And I think at the end of the day, where I think all of us kind of on this podcast can really agree, is we want to build applications, not for kind of the few hundred thousand people today, which, although they are important in the early adopters, we still want to build applications for later on, the tens of millions and hundreds of million people that will ultimately come into the ecosystem and making sure that your underlying blockchain, kind of the technical stack that you're building on at least has some path towards future scale is paramount.
00:25:12.902 - 00:25:19.370, Speaker B: So it's cool to hear kind of the idea maze that you went through to get to this point.
00:25:19.950 - 00:25:45.006, Speaker C: Yeah, and to a point I think I didn't mention this earlier. I remember the issues we experienced and since the day we've been live on. Sweet. I think obviously there's a long test of time to still pass, but we haven't. Our gas costs have stayed the same. Even when spikes happen in the network transactions that we're processing or the general network is processing. We haven't had availability issues.
00:25:45.006 - 00:25:55.372, Speaker C: And I think really this is rooted more in the fundamental design on how the mistin team approached the infrastructure behind the blockchain.
00:25:55.566 - 00:26:50.500, Speaker B: Yeah, fully agree. I'm bullish what they're building and excited to see what is to come within that ecosystem. And I think it's very cool just how early you guys really are in the grand scheme of things, not only the blockchain industry, but within the suite ecosystem as well. Maybe shifting the conversation though slightly towards more of the product side. Bill, you mentioned particularly around curating that product experience. So the user experience needs to be a certain way for kind of the average retail trader, and that ultimately may not be the exact same experience from an institutional client that wants to do $100 million in purpose rates. Can you kind of walk us through kind of your experience just designing these two different, designing the product for two different customer sets?
00:26:50.800 - 00:27:18.180, Speaker A: Yeah. I think me as a person, I'm obsessed with design and user experience over the obsessed. And Adrian get pissed off at me sometimes saying that why are you spending 12 hours a day with the designer? You need to focus in other areas and this needs to be part of a process. But we're just so obsessed with getting the user interface how user onboards onto the platform, like every detail. So, so, right. And I think that's super important. We're just unhealthily obsessed with that.
00:27:18.180 - 00:27:52.434, Speaker A: And right now, if someone comes onto the platform, we usually get a lot of great feedback on how easy it is to use the platform. I think onboarding onto Sui needs to get a lot better, but that's something a bit separate and it's also being addressed. The bridging experience isn't great, but once you're onto the product, it's very seamless. And in about two weeks from now, this is how the experience is going to look like. And it's a very close, you're going to be able to just come on there. You don't need to download any wallet or manage any private keys. You'll just connect your Google account and it's going to be natively secured by ZK login.
00:27:52.434 - 00:28:06.594, Speaker A: So you just, the way you go on LinkedIn right now, you connect your Google account, it's also going to be integrated with wormhole, so you can also support bridging with it. You can do all sorts of trading on the platform and that's really the user experience. And then on the back end, for.
00:28:06.602 - 00:28:18.690, Speaker B: Those that don't know what ZK login is and maybe kind of tapping into SWE and the suite ecosystem for the first time in layman terms. Can you communicate what that enables?
00:28:19.870 - 00:29:29.880, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I'll try to give the TLDR on it, which is at the moment, what is one big kind of friction point for you is this. It's not just downloading a wallet but also this concept of securing your seed phrase and your private keys and a lot of like, I guess like anxiety that can form around. Is it secure enough? Is hopefully good enough? Do I need a ledger securing these things? That's one of the, that's effectively what Zklogin aims to solve, which is tying your Google account to a web3 account that you can use to sign transactions. So it's abstracting away, dealing with private keys. How it does it in practice that gets pretty cryptographically intense on ZK proofs. But like I would say the TLDR is that it's a one way mapping between your Google account and the GWT token, which is the cryptographic proof it provides, adding a bit of more metadata to it and using ZK proofs and storing that in your crash. So it's a one way mapping from that account to this, this key phrase that's formed and stored locally in your browser that's behind the scenes signing everything, but it doesn't link back to your account explicitly.
00:29:31.830 - 00:29:46.526, Speaker B: The high level, I'd say no, I think it's great and maybe even to go one level higher, just allowing people to kind of onboard with the traditional private key but like through a Google or Facebook type interaction that they already know.
00:29:46.678 - 00:29:55.398, Speaker C: Yeah. And that final user experience is you come just Google Auth boom, you have an account you're trading. So, you know, for that everyday user, they don't even realize what's happening.
00:29:55.574 - 00:30:32.972, Speaker B: I do think, I mean, I'm very curious to see, and I do think a lot of the magic sauce within blockchains and the industry is that private key ownership, I mean, to your point earlier, being able to own those digital assets, have sovereignty over them, is important, but there's also a lot of kind of potential headaches that come with that. And so just private key management, private key education, the onboarding, it is cumbersome. But this ZK login I think is very interesting idea as a path forward to kind of making that onboarding experience a little bit more frictionless.
00:30:33.156 - 00:30:55.040, Speaker A: And I guess just to add on top of it, Zklogin today is embedded within the sweet wallet. What we're doing in about two weeks from now is taking that to the next level, which is talk a little bit more about it, is abstracting the wallet itself away and having that in the backend of Bluefin's front end. But AJ, you can talk a little bit more about how we're taking that to the next level.
00:30:55.820 - 00:31:37.476, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the simplest way is that net experiences you as a brand new user. You could, I mean, eventual goal is you could be unfamiliar with web3 entirely and land on this exchange and just be able to use your Google login to start trading. The friction point you're going to run into is, oh, how do I actually acquire funds now? And that's still, that's still where a web3 user is probably the first person that's going to start using this. And they have assets lying around that they can bridge into this immediately. And our goal is, okay for now, let's start with making it as simple as possible. Kind of click, click, click, and don't need to navigate away from us. Eventually aligning with SwE's vision is can we have Google pay to do that immediately? So it's Google sign in, Google Pay.
00:31:37.476 - 00:31:44.040, Speaker C: I don't know what that's going to take regulatory wise and others. That's a bit of a longer term, but that's what the eventual goal is to get to.
00:31:44.540 - 00:31:55.180, Speaker B: Makes sense. I apologize, I cut you off during your explanation on the user onboarding versus more retail versus institutional flows.
00:31:58.160 - 00:32:22.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I think as we mentioned, just making it super easy. And the goal is it's going to be easy within this month and then have the full stack integrated, including on ramps, by the end of the year. And then I think the market maker user experience, AJ, can go a little bit more into what that looks like because it's a little bit more technical heavy and creating that user experience that they need and that they're familiar with.
00:32:23.980 - 00:33:00.478, Speaker C: Yeah. From the partners that we've been working with now for some time. What I've observed is there's a latency requirement that they want, and how, if you want them to quote super tight to the true price, they want the ability to place and console orders very fast. And for that, that's where the design of the order book comes into play. And maybe I'll elaborate on that a bit. Now, where the way the protocol is designed at the moment is everything is, it's designed to be non custodial from the start. So all balances are unchained.
00:33:00.478 - 00:33:51.716, Speaker C: The margining engine and the execution of trades are all unchained. And the way that orders are constructed is you will specify a bunch of fields, but predominantly like a long cell. The asset, the quantity and the price. Let's assume these assets, these fields, and then you sign these using your private key, and you produce a signature. Now, this signature is what's submitted to our matching engine, which at the moment is off chain. So what the matching engine is responsible for is simply just matching, taking this order that you've signed off on and finding somebody else that also wants to trade at that price and submitting this on chain. So kind of here is what you see, where the user has no trust on us, on what price it executes at, whether, how much quantity it's going to fill, how much balance is going to get used, etcetera.
00:33:51.716 - 00:34:26.350, Speaker C: These things are all well known. It's that area around submitting it on chain that we're responsible for. And why are we doing that? It's 99% of orders that get submitted. They never get broadcasted, they never go unchained, because 99% of the orders are just market makers constantly moving their quotes. They're placing orders and the price moves by two take, three takes, they'll cancel them all, place new orders, and the actual throughput of trades is an order magnitude less. So if we're seeing thousands of orders being placed per second, we're seeing a few tens of trades happening per second. So that's, I think that's a great point.
00:34:26.470 - 00:35:07.138, Speaker B: I don't think people are kind of the layman, people that haven't like, dug into this enough really understand market making. Kind of setting the bids, the asks, the takers, the makers. It is complex. They're setting a lot of kind of trades, so to speak, on chain, just to make the market more liquid and more fluid. And a lot of that isn't necessarily just trade volume, it's just transactions on the chain. And it is a very critical part to kind of make this flywheel work. But it's also very challenging in kind of these decentralized systems.
00:35:07.138 - 00:35:10.990, Speaker B: To your point, AJ, because of the sum of the limitations.
00:35:11.890 - 00:35:50.120, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly correct. And I mean, I think another version of this has come to be true of oracles as well. Right? Where you've seen this new model emerging, where you're not constantly just publishing everything on chain, rather only the prices that are needed. I'd like to think that the order book is similar in that if 99% of these orders are never going to be executed on, you know, they don't necessarily need to go on chain. And at the moment, frankly, like, the speeds are not there for these order, for these market makers to quote thin. And that ties back, right, to what reveal was saying, because they're, they're not independent customers. The institutional user wants the retail flow to come.
00:35:50.120 - 00:36:34.320, Speaker C: The retail flow, the retail user needs good liquidity and death of they're going to come. Right. And so do you want to provide both? And I think the last thing I'll add is we did always think about a scenario, okay, what happens when, if the order book goes down, if this matching engine is, you know, like a central component. And that's where we did in the end, provision the protocol to work without the order book if needed, or if somebody wants to take a different route. Because if you remember, all you're doing is signing orders and specifying the price and quantity. So you can, through any really means, broadcast it or find somebody else and submit these trades yourself on chain. Anybody can submit them on chain as long because all these fields are guaranteed to be only executed within what you've specified.
00:36:34.740 - 00:37:07.890, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess to summarize that, right now, that's the architecture we have built on the non custodial premise, but also just really, really focusing on user experience in both ends, which is why our order book, majority of the time, is one tick wide. That is incredible liquidity. That's allowing us to process the scale we are right now. But that being said, I think the ultimate win is if you can also fully decentralize that stack. It's something that we want to do that we're researching and figuring out. It's not our top priority, but something. We hopefully get to have something out there by end of year.
00:37:07.890 - 00:37:16.560, Speaker A: But right now, just focus on user experience and in the backdrop, figure out solutions that will allow for a similar user experience both ends.
00:37:17.220 - 00:37:58.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I recently just did a podcast with one of the or the CTO of pith and AJ, we were talking about kind of the pull model versus the push model, and the pull model obviously being more scalable because you're not publishing everything all the time. And to your point, on kind of putting all those quotes on chain, do you think from a technical perspective, at least in today's world, with throughput not being where we ultimately want it to be, do you think you can ultimately decentralize the whole stack, or do you think eventually it will be a blend of kind of this off chain model and on chain?
00:37:59.870 - 00:38:37.802, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's, in practice, going to keep just going through more iterations. I'd like to believe that eventually it will reach there. Even as we've been doing R and D, I think what we'll take a step closer to it. So we're exploring the idea of. So he has this concept of owned objects, and these owned objects go on chain much faster because of how the consensus happens. It's right now 400 milliseconds intended to get even faster. And we're looking through ideas of, can you batch a bunch of these into one owned object and then have that one owner of that object send it on chain and this way, and then you're nothing.
00:38:37.802 - 00:39:15.044, Speaker C: Kind of broadcasting everyone. I think likely it's going to fall among somewhere around here as the first step where whether you take this approach that we're rnd or others are looking at validators, et cetera, they're all kind of following some falling somewhere in that middle where it's a step further. But right now, with the tech that currently exists and what we're seeing with market makers on this, we're talking like tens of milliseconds. That's how fast they're updating their quotes. And at that scale, it's not, I think, on chin books will exist just fine. It's just that market makers are not going to code as tight. So what they'll do is they'll just go a bit wider.
00:39:15.044 - 00:39:33.440, Speaker C: It gives them, even if the price moves a bit, is a bigger buffer to cancel their order. And that's working is almost like a correlation between how fast can I place and cancel orders and how tight I'll get. So that'll be the trade off. And I think eventually we'll start getting closer and closer towards, you know, lower, lower spreads on chain.
00:39:35.100 - 00:40:16.500, Speaker B: I am very curious. You mentioned ultimately kind of the SWE fast path. I think a lot of my listeners are kind of familiar with high throughput blockchains in general, but not may not fully appreciate all the nuances that you really spoke to. And I think when I think of SwE, the fastpass consensus that allows for that extremely fast latency or extremely low latency and fast finality, as you mentioned, 400 milliseconds is extremely impressive. Can you maybe just on a high level speak to that and then how you guys, I mean I think you did briefly touch upon it, but go into how you plan to exploit that even further.
00:40:17.760 - 00:41:02.642, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think what's important to is they offer, it's so, okay, it's an object data model that's like the first thing to understand that everything is represented as an object. And this unlocks many things. There's like native object ownership, there's dynamic fields and how these objects are passed on. I'll break these down a bit later. But with objects there's a distinction between do you own this object, does another object own it? Or is this a shared object? And if it becomes a shared object, which is the default case, then now you need consensus with everyone on the state over here. And this ends up taking a bit longer, I think on, sweetie, we're seeing somewhere around 2 seconds at the moment for consensus on that.
00:41:02.642 - 00:42:11.370, Speaker C: Now if you're instead you, if it's an owned object, it's, I don't want to, you know, butcher the details because I'm definitely not the consensus and cryptography expert, but the TLDR is on how they approach consensus here. It allows them to have like a two third majority and reach consensus much faster on the state of this own object. And this ends up going through in four milliseconds how we intend to take kind of leverage. This is we're re approaching our on chain protocol and seeing, okay, we know that if we have an own object that it's not going to require this full blown consensus. And so with every single trade, if we can ensure that the two users are in a unique market and are unique parties, and know that same user is not participating in another trade at the same time, we can execute these in parallel. And so then the kind of key becomes, okay, market makers are this one kind of user that's almost in many of these. So if you have enough market makers, you have to kind of start partitioning by market makers and how you approach these executions.
00:42:11.370 - 00:42:46.476, Speaker C: But that's the fundamental driver between how we're re architecting, which is unique traders are on unique markets can start happening at the same time. And this, what this does is increase our TPS. So at the moment there's two things often there's like latency. Okay, how fast is it? Can you execute one trade, but then the second is how fast can you concurrently execute trades? So even if it's only 400 milliseconds, if you can do 100 trades at the same time, then your TPS goes much further, goes up by a lot more. So that's kind of the summary of what we're approaching there.
00:42:46.668 - 00:44:12.970, Speaker B: I know we're nerding out a little bit and I'll bring it back to the product side, but I truly think you are at the forefront of something very interesting, and I appreciate you going into a little bit more depth there because you are going to. This will enable some new types of applications and I don't think very many builders have gone as far into the weeds as the team there and to see how you're experimenting, thinking about it, kind of the lower latency, the faster finality, it should unlock some unique use cases, which I think not only do engineers just kind of starting to play around with, and I think Bluefin is at the forefront there, but VC's and kind of the investor community are so far behind, they haven't really caught on to what you guys can actually do in these high throughput ecosystems that are uniquely tailored to that fast finality. So super excited there may be bringing it back to the product side though. You have all these unique innovations, you've guys been grinding throughout the bear market the last three months. Things have been picking up. How do you really see the next twelve months ultimately playing out from say trying to compete with these more larger centralized entities, a coinbase or a binance of the world?
00:44:13.870 - 00:44:26.642, Speaker A: I think that's our top priority right now. And it has both the user experience which has performance as a bucket within it. Most Ethereum l two s, for example, their TPS is typically around 100, right?
00:44:26.746 - 00:44:40.922, Speaker B: That's nowhere near even less from what I've seen. It's kind of funny because the high throughput blockchains typically are doing more transactions per second than all l two s combined, which I just kind of find comical, but.
00:44:40.986 - 00:45:17.628, Speaker A: Exactly. There's no way you can build something that competes with the centralized exchange over there, at least in our opinion. It just cannot process that level of scale and we haven't really seen that come into defi yet. So I think first and foremost it needs to be somewhere that can process that process, that scale. And maybe majority of the time it's fine, but the time that it matters is like the 3% tail end of the times where markets are super volatile and there's a lot of transactions. Then the first part is like being on a high performance blockchain. There's many high performance blockchains, but I think finality is also a core component because that's what impacts user experience.
00:45:17.628 - 00:45:46.206, Speaker A: So you can have 100,000 tps, but if it takes 5 seconds for it to finalize, it's not good. That's way too slow from a user's point of view. So as AJ was mentioning, with owned objects, it needs to be sub second. Like you click a trade and it goes through. I think that's the first part. The second part is being the easiest to use. And that means that you don't need to download a new wallet, you don't need to secure your private key, you don't have difficulties bridging funds over.
00:45:46.206 - 00:46:29.230, Speaker A: And that's really the second focus for us. The next two quarters, particularly one, it's abstracting away all of the wallet components, and then two, working with the Sweet foundation on making it super easy for users to deposit assets, whether it's something like axelar or layer zero. Two for one click deposits from any other chain to direct deposits from centralized exchanges, and then three, on ramps directly onto the sweet blockchain. So I think once we can get both of these components done, hopefully by next quarter, that's really when you can have a user experience that competes with a binance, a coinbase, and I think that's when we can start taking over that addressable market.
00:46:30.290 - 00:46:52.738, Speaker B: And what products, offerings today do you have? I know you kind of the specialties specialization is perps, but doing spot, et cetera. Can you kind of just like dive into what products offerings today? What tokens have you seen being trading and when doing these hundreds, millions of volumes?
00:46:52.914 - 00:47:17.184, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Right now we focus on a type of future that's called perps. These are the most popular assets right now in web3. And so that's a core focus of Bluefin right now. It's a type of derivative, fairly straightforward to expand to futures or if you wanted to go into options two after this. But right now we're focusing on getting the core product really, really right. We think there's a great use case over here.
00:47:17.184 - 00:47:45.196, Speaker A: We're seeing flow already. And so we currently only have four markets on the platform. BTC and Eth see most of the volume today. And where we're going with this is we want to get the next version of our protocol out. AJ will go a little bit deeper into that, you know, but that version will equip us to start competing with centralized exchanges. It also requires us to redeploy our contracts and have a migration towards it. That's the point when we'll aggressively look to add a lot more markets.
00:47:45.196 - 00:48:18.390, Speaker A: Our goal is at least 100 more markets by the end of the year. And then I think we do want to add spot markets, we do want to add options. But I think right now focus is so important. I think like think of leadership as like a line with people, you know, following you. And the more you go, like the more you wind, the slower you move. And so it's so important to just like focus, get the core thing right and then like look to expand after that. So right now focusing purely on futures perps specifically, we want to get it really, really right by next quarter.
00:48:18.390 - 00:48:22.810, Speaker A: And, you know, once we think we're at a good, good spot with that, then, like to expand.
00:48:23.760 - 00:49:01.630, Speaker B: Yeah, and I always loved, I love that Analogy. The one that Elon used at Tesla was everybody is a vector and all those vectors need to be aligned in the same direction and ultimately to as much as possible, a high degree of movement in the same direction. Because to your point, it does take a long time to make one excellent product, let alone five or six kind of within the product offering. But I'd love to also tap into how you're going to expand it from the technical perspective as well. AJ?
00:49:02.290 - 00:49:37.420, Speaker C: Yeah, this is actually kind of what we were getting into earlier with the own objects of partitioning. That's almost, that's exactly what we're working on at the moment. And the idea is that if we want to tap into scale a we know some of our tech debt, I think all systems have some debt. It's an opportunity to re architect for that. For our market makers in these speeds and the incs, we provide them. But down to the core infrastructure that say we did see a magnitude increase in volumes. Can we still bring these all on chain or like benchmarks, say yeah, and now it's about just building, redesigning architecture to enable that.
00:49:37.420 - 00:50:14.084, Speaker C: And I think besides this, we're also now a lot more familiar with move as a programming language. I think it's awesome. It enables a lot more than solidity did initially. And so I think there's many things that as more experienced developers in that space, we're also bringing into the tech. And really it's now for us building a product that we think for the next one to two years will be, definitely can handle the scale that we anticipate. And I think once we cross that hurdle, there's definitely still the onto an order book to figure out. Still very much holy grail have answers.
00:50:14.132 - 00:50:33.480, Speaker B: There yet in terms of, I mean, the trading volumes with the few pairs is very impressive. Do you have any metrics on like active wallets that have been trading like where the volumes kind of are coming from based off like IP addresses, like what part of the world? I'm curious as to what metrics you have that you can share.
00:50:33.900 - 00:50:59.840, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the platform is accessible for most countries except for the US, and so far we're seeing about 5000 weekly active users. I think it's a similar scale to a lot of derivative dexs and something we're working to scale even further. Interestingly, a lot of our users right now are coming from Korea and broader Asia in general. So that's where we're seeing a lot of traction coming onto the platform today from.
00:51:00.860 - 00:51:49.018, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting. I recently, well, not recently, last say six months or so, went my first time to South Korea and South Korea blockchain week. And it is interesting how active that community or part of the world is really becoming and their openness to kind of be chain agnostic. It's just like to your point, like does it solve the product need that they're looking to fill? And I think that's what ultimately gets me excited about kind of where we're going in the future of the industry to make sure that we're actually building things people want. And I'm very excited that we can now kind of get to the starting line and do that to some degree with a level of scale, for sure.
00:51:49.154 - 00:52:11.330, Speaker A: And a lot of people might think buffin is a sweet play. I think we're definitely leveraging a lot of sweet tech, but ultimately people don't even need to know it's on suite. We think the tech is good enough to obstruct all of that away and will definitely benefit from ecosystem tailwinds, from composability from other builders there. But really ultimately for the user, they don't even need to know that it's on suite.
00:52:11.630 - 00:53:02.450, Speaker B: Yep, agreed. Exciting times ahead. Maybe last kind of closing remarks. We've touched upon a lot kind of your guys individual journey into web3, kind of starting in the EVM land, pivoting with some of the troublesomes of just lack of scale within those ecosystems, going into cockroach mode, surviving the depths of the bear market and now really coming out on the other side from nothing else than just like sheer will by grinding throughout the bear market and now trading volumes are picking back up is there I guess, just any general advice to like founders, either investors that are looking into like the sui ecosystem or other projects alike as like final parting words?
00:53:07.430 - 00:53:47.340, Speaker A: I think generally the tech and the product are amazing, are incredible. I think the team is extremely supportive on some of the primitives you might want. For example, we're launching a governance module very soon and want to decentralize that component of our stack and it doesn't already exist, but we're working directly with the team. So I think it's an ecosystem that's very technically and product led first and that's what we love. I think that that should be the first priority. And it's super easy to work with their engineering team to even build new things that you want. So I'm just going to speak to the people and the product and the tech and maybe AJ can talk a little bit more about it.
00:53:47.640 - 00:54:26.632, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the other. I would. I'm curious actually after this call to go do this research, but I'm feeling that move as a programming language is also closer to anybody that's kind of entering the web3 world for the first time in the it's a bit more familiar to the modern languages that we use in the web two world. And I think that just sets up for a lot easier onboarding accessibility into, into this space. So I think that's one definite kind of advantage that exists within, within that space. Now it is over time, so it's going to take a bit more time for a lot of other developer products that get added to it.
00:54:26.656 - 00:54:26.816, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:26.848 - 00:55:00.656, Speaker C: I think there's things like tenderly and others on EVM because it has the benefit of time. But I think I definitely see this getting some adoption. And besides this, I think if you're building a company, and I think there's a lot of general advice that we've learned over time. But I think the biggest takeaway for me, frankly, over the last few years is build with people you enjoy working with. I think that's what in the end will motivate you to come into work in the morning, to like push through hard times, because that is what you get to, that's what you get to hold on to when it gets tough. And I think that'll be the biggest game changer.
