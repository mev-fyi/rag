00:00:00.160 - 00:00:13.622, Speaker A: Brian Johnson. I'm a partner at Republic Capital. Taught myself to code in c, taught myself to build an unreal engine. I was doing a lot stuff doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. Going back to the.com bloon and bus. You can definitely see that in crypto.
00:00:13.622 - 00:00:40.514, Speaker A: Oddly enough, it takes a few generations. It has to be like that. We just, you know, it works. And you don't have to understand the tech, especially on the retail side, because life is so complicated. We need to move away from this religious sentiment on chains. Right. Obviously some tech is better, and obviously we're going to be multi chain, because if you don't want to be one nation and you don't want to be stuck to that chain, like, if you would disagree with the way a certain chain is going and the governance is going, you can move to a new one.
00:00:40.514 - 00:00:45.350, Speaker A: So you definitely need multiple chains, but you don't need all these.
00:00:48.770 - 00:00:57.350, Speaker B: Well, super excited to have you here, Brian. We first connected, I think, in Spain and. No, actually I think New York.
00:00:58.220 - 00:01:10.628, Speaker A: I was thinking about that. I was thinking about what we could have did. My memory goes back to Spain, but I think you came to our office before then. You were just starting. Frictionless.
00:01:10.804 - 00:01:27.012, Speaker B: Exactly. Very, very early days. You're one of the few that knew about it. And I think definitely before even the podcast. So one of the true ogs, but. And I also just wanted to say happy birthday. Your birthday.
00:01:27.116 - 00:01:27.468, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:27.484 - 00:01:28.440, Speaker B: Congratulations.
00:01:29.010 - 00:01:31.350, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm 34.
00:01:31.930 - 00:01:32.898, Speaker B: Amazing, amazing.
00:01:32.954 - 00:01:39.458, Speaker A: Started your wrinkles a little bit. Beyonce is telling me I should go get Botox now, so I'm at that stage.
00:01:39.634 - 00:01:46.682, Speaker B: Oh, no. Oh, no. Not a problem. Crypto definitely ages us a little bit.
00:01:46.866 - 00:01:50.670, Speaker A: Yeah. If I go to Korea blockchain week, maybe I'll get it there. I heard it's.
00:01:52.610 - 00:02:06.320, Speaker B: Perfect. Perfect. Well, I would love to start the podcast just with a little bit about yourself, what you're doing at Republic, how you got into the blockchain and crypto space, and let's kick it off and start from there.
00:02:06.780 - 00:02:28.198, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, it's a long story, so I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. Just by journey into crypto, I would say so. Brian Johnson. I'm a partner at Republic Capital. We sit under the ecosystem of Republic, which is, we started out as an equity crowdfunding platform, Republic.com dot.
00:02:28.198 - 00:02:55.850, Speaker A: And so our mission overall, and still is to this day, is to democratize investing, allowing everyday people to invest in startups. But that's not where I sit. I sit on the institutional side. So if I leave you split us in two. We're the typical VC side of things, and Republic.com is the equity crowdfunding side. On our side, we're a registered investment advisor, too, so we have to be separate and have a wall between us.
00:02:55.850 - 00:03:07.918, Speaker A: But we're very much like a family, I would say, so to speak. And we didn't start at the same time, too. But maybe I'll start on my background a little bit first and then how I came to Republic.
00:03:08.094 - 00:03:08.574, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:03:08.662 - 00:03:51.854, Speaker A: Funnily enough, my first forte into crypto was in 2009. I actually stumbled upon the bitcoin whitepaper. It's not as glamorous as you would think, but I was a sophomore in college. I was a business major, the entrepreneurship minor. And I remember I was in my dorm, and I was really reading hacker news. And funnily enough, all my friends were engineers because just where we lived on south campus in Syracuse. And, you know, they were, you know, since we hung out, we were always talking about technical stuff, played Mario Kart together and stuff like that.
00:03:51.854 - 00:04:38.362, Speaker A: So just going through the startup news and stuff like that, because obviously entrepreneurship, it was super interesting to me and stumbled upon it. And regrettably, I skimmed through it. I didn't really read it in full, so I got it. And especially with the great Recession going on, so had a, you know, understanding of it and the need for it, but didn't really, I guess, pull the trigger. I would say you could download the bitcoin client, too, but also I had a Mac, so I couldn't actually run it. And I'm sure if I did, knowing me and just myself at that age, I was a moron still. I'm to a degree, but I would say, but I, I would have definitely lost it all.
00:04:38.362 - 00:05:14.052, Speaker A: I would have definitely left it on that computer, forgot the private key, would have note. I didn't even know what a private key was at the time. And also, like, your private key looked like your public key, and it was just like one was just longer than the other, right? So I forgot about it. And then, funnily enough, stumbled upon it again. But this time on Reddit, I think it was Reddit. It was some forum where some guy was doing an auction for 10,000 bitcoin for, I think it was like $50. He was seeing how much he could get, and I was like, you know, maybe I couldn't mine it, I remember, or run the client, but maybe I could just buy it.
00:05:14.052 - 00:05:47.032, Speaker A: And then I was like, how do I know he's not going to just run away with my $50. And then I'll probably have to ask him how to set up a bitcoin wallet, because it was just. It was a lot of, just do it on your own. Wild west still is a little bit, you know, to actually very much so to a degree in this case. But I just, knowing me and just where I was and just my carelessness, I knew. And also I was just poor, a poor college student. That $50 was very valuable to me.
00:05:47.032 - 00:06:24.406, Speaker A: So, granted, that's why I'm not in a yacht right now. But after that point, obviously totally forgot about it, and then graduated college and, you know, got a traditional finance job, was analyst at a commodity training advisor. But on the side with my best friend, we were trying to do, you know, figure out what we want to do and start our company. So we were brainstorming, obviously doing it in the evening. So it was taking longer than expected to figure out what we wanted to do. And also, you know, we incorporated a company. Not incorporated.
00:06:24.406 - 00:06:58.310, Speaker A: We set up an llc. Obviously, I did it wrong. I did in New Jersey, which was mistake, but you learn from those. As a startup founder or whatever, we wanted to do something in the app space, on the app store. We had a couple ideas that really didn't pull through, and so we shipped to the gaming side of things. Meanwhile, I'm still working in traditional finance, and so definitely long hours. I wouldn't do it again, but it was definitely fun to do with your best friend, I would say.
00:06:58.310 - 00:07:58.460, Speaker A: Oftentimes you fight and stuff like that, and you have disagreements. I started getting more and more into crypto as the years went on, and started saying that to my buddy, I think this is probably the avenue we should go down. It seems like this is just the new wave of finance. We came out of college at the same time towards the middle of the great Recession. Getting jobs in that space was just super difficult, and I was luckily enough to get a job at this Kamala trading advisor. Funnily enough, they had their margins at Mann Financial, and they got basically, I don't know if you saw in the news back in, gosh, 2012, 2013, basically core Zion, GSU, and we basically lost our margins. We got like, Mount Gobst, basically.
00:07:58.460 - 00:08:42.856, Speaker A: So I ended up going to a bigger bank, unicredit. I was working on the supply chain finance side, also the foreign exchange conversion side. We had these proprietary products in house, and definitely saw more and more just the need for crypto when I was basically doing these conversions from euros to dollars. And also on the supply chain finance side, just how much crypto just could open this up as a whole. And crypto became more and more of a hobby. Also, on the gaming side, that was also a hobby with my buddy. We were still trying to figure out a product market fit for just our ideas.
00:08:42.856 - 00:09:40.744, Speaker A: We had shifted to VR at the time, too. Taught myself to code in c, taught myself to build an unreal engine. I was doing a lot, really. I was definitely spread too thin and at the same time being a dj in crypto and just buying up Ethan bitcoin and then selling at the lows, obviously, because I was very risk averse too, and I thought it was over every time it went down. This could go on forever. But long story short, I was like, what am I doing? Obviously, we were too early in VR with my friend and the startup side, but learned so much about the gaming space and just like, what works and what doesn't and how risky it is, and especially if you're an indie game developer. And then, you know, crypto was just being in the traditional banking side, just seeing the opportunity there and seeing it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, and just, and also knowing a bunch of mentors on my side who came out of the.com
00:09:40.744 - 00:10:35.178, Speaker A: boom and either sold companies or tried to build a company. And the funny story from that is one of my close friends, and I said, close friends, close family friends, sold the company during that time. It was, the pitch was, if you don't buy us, we're going to buy you. And so all these web two, all these not, I say web two, all these non web two companies were basically like, holy shit, we're going to miss out. And so they would buy Time Warner buying AOL, and so, and so buying, you know, XYz company that were just making no revenue, right? And so, like, it's all playing out again. And just, you could see that. But, you know, it, obviously, the Internet had its, you know, its boom and bust cycle where there was just no revenue, but actually there was the, you know, the global Internet is now massive.
00:10:35.178 - 00:11:15.948, Speaker A: It's not a fax machine, you know, like a glorified fax machine, like Kruger said, you know. And so, long story short, ended up leaving the bank, got a job at a family office where we were like, in the basement of the family office, a high frequency trading firm. We were doing the Degen, crypto and cannabis stuff, and also had a security token offering platform called SAF launch at the time. And then Renjin. It was exciting, exciting times. I was working till like 02:00 a.m. just dealing with users of the platform because we raised for Tzero back in the day.
00:11:15.948 - 00:11:50.076, Speaker A: I don't know if you remember that. It was Patrick Burns security token trading exchange still around today. I don't know how they're doing, but I haven't tracked them since then and raised $100 million. It was crazy. It was like, in a week. And shortly after that, both crypto and cannabis took a dive. And funnily enough, actually, not many people know this, but during that time, I couldn't tell you how many calls because we also had a venture arm that where we invested separate, obviously, from the platform.
00:11:50.076 - 00:12:20.740, Speaker A: You always have these walls. There was at least ten or more founders that I talked to where they were going to do some crypto project, you name it. And they also were on the side after the call, they were like, and by the way, I know you guys are into cannabis. My other startup is a cannabis oil extraction company based in California. Kidding. Or not. It was like ten or so calls I had where it ended on that.
00:12:20.740 - 00:12:30.256, Speaker A: We also looked at the cannabis side, too, but we never pulled the trigger on those because obviously to spread too thin.
00:12:30.408 - 00:12:30.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:30.960 - 00:12:31.580, Speaker A: And.
00:12:33.720 - 00:12:40.500, Speaker B: Ultimately, all of this kind of led you to join Republic and spearhead the efforts there.
00:12:41.080 - 00:13:24.128, Speaker A: Yeah. So, funnily enough, we were actually on the board of Republic, and the family office still is, and it's a multifamily office. So when crypto and cannabis took a dive, they were like, pause for now on just the investing side and the platform side, and let's just go back to our main core business. And so I knew how to operate these spvs and funds. I knew how to spin up a platform and knew how to navigate in the crypto space and invest in it. So I joined Republic in 2019. That's when we formed Republic Labs, which is effectively our investment armor.
00:13:24.128 - 00:14:11.610, Speaker A: It was called labs at the time, just to see if we could build the Aum of republic as a whole and build out this institutional capital side. So it was four of us at the time. It was myself, Christian Sullivan, Boris Repson, and Julian John. I wore many hats. All of us wore pretty much every hat on that side. And so I built out the operations side and also our crypto investment thesis. Funnily enough, I say that a lot, but we started out investing in the space, like aerospace and defense and a couple small checks here and there on the crypto side, because we wanted to build a track record and not just be beholden to one market, because we had expertise in space and also in crypto.
00:14:11.610 - 00:14:52.978, Speaker A: We did a couple small checks here and there in some other sectors because of lp interest, but generally building out that track record so we could down the road launch traditional pooled funds on the both traditional side and on the crypto side. And that's what we've done. And yeah, since then we've grown to, gosh, no, no, 17 or 18 folks on our side built out this big operations team. We have several funds underneath our umbrella and yeah, it's been a wild ride. It's, you know, Republic as a whole. Worthen, technically, I would say three arms. We have the platform side, which is republic.com
00:14:52.978 - 00:15:26.612, Speaker A: for anyone can invest in us startups. And it's through specifically regulation crowdfunding, which was enabled by the Jobs act in 2016. And then we have a separate arm, which is Republic advisory, run by Andrew Durgi and Brian Mint. And effectively, I say it's our crypto merchant bank. You know, you name it, whitepaper token token economics. We even build a token for you if needed help with listing. We have our own token offering platform as well, compliant with KYC and AML.
00:15:26.612 - 00:15:54.560, Speaker A: We have also a treasure management solution. We run our own nodes as well. I think we're one of the largest avalanche nodes, if I'm not mistaken, and run a bunch of other nodes for you named L1. We probably run a note for it. So just being this overall ecosystem on the, you know, the retail side, the advisory side, and the institutional side and trying to be this one stop shop for private capital.
00:15:55.100 - 00:16:47.680, Speaker B: Amazing. Crazy story. Yeah, I always find it fascinating. It's hard to, it's hard to kind of make those jumps and so especially kind of being with the Republic team since inception, as I'm going through now, just wearing all the different hats that you have to do to bootstrap that and get off the ground, it's not easy. And so applaud you and the team just being in the space from like 2019 when you guys started. I mean, ultimately you were in the space prior, but like once you guys like officially started the fund, since now, what have been like some of the biggest things that you've learned, I mean, one through like 2017, but also now since the funds live and being a capital allocator through this last bull market.
00:16:48.540 - 00:17:44.292, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely in the ventures side of things you could see that stuff doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme. And going back to the.com balloon and bus and then it's a surgeons after that, you can definitely see that in crypto, especially with the adoption of just any new technology, oddly enough, it takes a few generations. So the Internet took 30 years, give or take. And the telephone, the cell phone, 30 years for mass adoption. So if you look at crypto, we're 1415 years in, we still have another 1415 years to go. I think it might be shorter given that the access to information and just us being a globally connected world now in terms of just markets, it might go faster.
00:17:44.292 - 00:18:36.010, Speaker A: But on our side we definitely take the view that we're still very much in the roads and the tunnels stage of the industry where the learning curve is still very, very high. Too high, too damn high. And you know, the user base, you can, you can see it too. Like I talked to my little half brother who's Gen Z saying like, you know, hey, does crypto interest you at all? And he couldn't give to, can I curse? He have two shits. So I'm like, well if it's not, you know, all my cousins and stuff, all Gen Z, they couldn't care less. And I'm like, well you're supposed to be the ones that I'm selling this to. They're into Roblox and Fortnite and stuff like that.
00:18:36.010 - 00:19:13.150, Speaker A: So maybe I'm thinking it's Gen Alpha and they're probably still learning to talk. So that's why I think we still got quite a bit more time. But it doesn't mean that we're too early. In my mind there's still massive opportunities for just the infrastructure side of things and also in their intermediate, where we are now, I think another low hanging fruit is the gaming side of things, but not what you see with those. There's 10,000 nfts. You have to own one of them to play the game. That game costs $2,000 to play.
00:19:13.150 - 00:20:15.142, Speaker A: That to me doesn't make any sense at all. The blockchain side on the tech has to be on the underlayer where you don't even know that there is a blockchain there, right? Like you don't like. If you think about just comparables on the Internet side of things, like most people you just knew to put in HTTP, you know, backslash, and you didn't eventually, you just didn't have to put it at all and you didn't know that it upgraded to HTTPs, right? And so it has to be like that. We just, you know, it works and you don't have to understand the tech, especially on the retail side, because life is so complicated. So like just knowing like how a ZK works, you know, how a certain l one has a different consensus than this l one, just blending that all together, making it easy for the consumer. So definitely we look at a bunch of tech and investments on that side, like what basically enables the next billion users. That's why we love Solana on our side.
00:20:15.142 - 00:21:00.580, Speaker A: You can see there's so much pushback on it from early on, when Solana had, it had its run, people saying it's not decentralized enough, and it doesn't fit the core thesis of crypto. But I disagree. It was the most fun to use. It onboarded millions of new users when it launched, the fees were super low. You know, the tech was there, and the founders, Tolly and Raj, I think they're, they're great guys. And just, you know, totally coming from Qualcomm, it just makes total sense. And just like, the vision, seeing how you can grow a distributed system if you come from a place like Qualcomm, where, you know, where they had to scale in terms of these, you know, the mobile infrastructure.
00:21:00.580 - 00:21:26.310, Speaker A: Right. Which is why you'll make fun of the Solana phone. But I think it's a genius idea. Like, regardless if it fails or not, I think it's a great bet. How do you get the normies into crypto? You do it with hardware, and hardware that's easy to use and understand, like a phone. Right. And so, I mean, we're still on our side, very excited about Solana's future, I would say.
00:21:26.310 - 00:21:52.034, Speaker A: And, you know, even when Solana had some of its issues, it was, to us, it was growing painst. Right. Obviously, you know, everyone was worried. Right. And, you know, it's, it's normal to be worried about those things when you go through growing pains. But, you know, if we have a, one of my best friends works at salon lab, so it's like, I, you know, I, you get messages from them and say, like, you know, stop, stop worrying. Right.
00:21:52.034 - 00:21:56.066, Speaker A: And just like, it's just, you know, this just happens to all tech at the end of the day.
00:21:56.098 - 00:22:35.388, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I would definitely echo the sentiments that, I mean, it needs to get to the level of abstraction, that most people just can use it without having to really think about it. And I mean, just like IP addresses, I mean, mapped to domain names. When you think about how we send crypto, even to and from each other today, it's still these long kind of key pairings, and they're not super easy or often very easy to mess up a single kind of key or enter it, and so.
00:22:35.564 - 00:23:05.638, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Sending to the wrong address. Your address looks like it should be the seed phrase. The seed phrase looks like it should be the address. It's like all those little things. We're still very much, if you talk to the devs, not focused on the consumer side, focus very much on the technical side still, I would argue too much, but we're getting there and I think it's just, you know, it's better to, you know, get there step by step than just, you know, run and off to the races. And I think it's just telling just where we are in the space.
00:23:05.638 - 00:23:47.810, Speaker A: And it just makes sense from historical adoptions of technology as well, which is why I'm so excited about just the opportunities in space, especially in the bear market. We love the bear markets on our side because valuations are down. VC's that were entering the space, investors that were entering the space during the bull market are maybe sitting on the sidelines more now. And so there's an opportunity to get into deals that have, I would argue, more favorable valuations and where you can invest in and get an opportunity at allocation more so than oftentimes you get squeezed out of some deals and you wish you didn't.
00:23:48.430 - 00:24:48.290, Speaker B: Definitely, no, I mean, the past couple of years were definitely crazy. I mean, I think Ethereum really laid the foundation and I mean, spurred the entire kind of smart contract space. And then it was amazing to kind of watch Defi summer blossom. Ultimately that led to nfts and then this proliferation of different layer ones and how they approach different scaling solutions and really laying that groundwork for trying to build the interesting kind of consumer applications to be built on top of it. But from this past cycle, was there anything. I don't think many of us kind of anticipated the FTX blow up or even with like Luna, what, what were like some of the biggest kind of learnings that you've had just now going through like a full cycle as like a professional capital allocator.
00:24:49.510 - 00:25:37.246, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, I would say some of the learnings, I mean the, probably the biggest learning on the VC side is that not every deal needs to be an investment. There's so many deals out there, just like there's so many fish in the sea. Right. You know, you don't need to get into every hot deal. And, you know, every deal that we do has a thesis behind it and generally, you know, some of those thesis don't work out, but more or less, you know, we, you know, put a huge amount of diligence behind every, every trade that we do. And sometimes the valuation might just be way too high because every tier one under the sun is trying to get into it.
00:25:37.246 - 00:26:40.338, Speaker A: And it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a great return for LP's, even though it's probably going to be a cornerstone tech in the market, and it's probably going to take a huge amount of market share and just be that needed tech that everyone is going to end up using or might not even know that they're using. And so it's okay to miss those, I would say. And we're very cognizant of that. And now it's also why again, we love bear markets more than the bull markets for investing on our side. And you saw that from the great Recession. Wherever I all the notable VC's or most of the notable VC's came out of that. Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, and all those notable apps that we use today, like WhatsApp, Dropbox, Slack, you name it, it just came out of that down market.
00:26:40.338 - 00:27:50.606, Speaker A: And so that's, we're very cognizant of that and how just the world tends to rhyme. And I think we're seeing it play out in our industry right now, and so it's very exciting. Another thing that was very eye opening as well was how many bridge hacks we had. I mean, we had all these centralized failures, but the bridge hacks were a mix of decentralized and centralized failures as well. And what we're looking at now is novel solutions that prevent those, whether it be security or a new type of messaging protocol that makes these hacks more preventable. You're also seeing now, too, whispers about how AI and blockchain could intersect and help improve security. I haven't seen any deals yet, and I feel like the tech is probably, definitely still early, and it's probably going to be a bubble across the whole sector of AI, whether it be on SaaS or social networks and on the decentralized side.
00:27:50.606 - 00:28:42.138, Speaker A: But it is super interesting, and it definitely is something we're on the lookout for because everyone has used chat GPT. There's more users in chat GPT than there are in crypto, that's for sure. That's another reason why we're still early. But if you see the power that chat GPT had, it's scary and also exciting. And you definitely can envision a time where we'll have an AI just as like a white hat, like a 24/7 white hat, just monitoring transactions and maybe even fixing bugs in real time. But I think you'll probably still need a blend of human Nai when it comes to smart contract auditing. If anyone sees anything interesting, I still think it's too early.
00:28:42.138 - 00:28:47.586, Speaker A: But you have all these AI meme coins too, which are.
00:28:47.738 - 00:29:36.914, Speaker B: There's always garbage. I mean, the AI trend, I think GPT definitely kind of kicked it off with all the excitement there, but it's definitely will be one watch. Going back to like, it's not a particular area of focus that we're looking at. I mean, I'm really fascinated just by AI in general. I really fell down kind of the autonomous car rabbit hole following, I mean, just working at Tesla and the different tech stacks there. But now I try to kind of be an expert at one thing, and I think my brain only has so much capacity for crypto, and if I tried to add AI in there, I think it would explode.
00:29:36.962 - 00:29:47.390, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the same for me. We don't have an AI expert here, so that's why we're still not doing any. But I mean, we could have a partner down the road that's an expert in that field, definitely.
00:29:47.810 - 00:30:22.266, Speaker B: So, I mean, we've really had this kind of mean bull market. A lot of it was like building out infrastructure. We had Kind of the composability and Defi summer kicking off. Then we had like the explosion on the nft front, really. It was kind of marketplaces that really kind of stole the show to some sense. And then also on the wallet side, but I mean, we were talking really about how few users are. It's so kind of complex today on the application front and, like, products.
00:30:22.266 - 00:30:28.310, Speaker B: What are you, like, uniquely excited about that you think needs to get built?
00:30:29.890 - 00:31:40.414, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot, you know, on the one thing that comes to mind off the bat is the institutional side. So we are seeing, you know, on the back end, institutions are still building in the space and still thinking of ways to integrate and offering it to their customers. And so there's institutional Defi products that are coming out, institutional staking products that are coming out. And so the adoption is going to happen on the institutional side, I think, before it happens on the retail side, and you're going to basically have the rails from the institutions offered to retail to make them feel more comfortable, I think, because the security is just not there. Like, I don't know if you talk to your parents, ask them, like, you know, if they hold any crypto or not, but mine certainly don't, even though I've been in the space forever. And even during the bull market, they don't even ask me, like, where do I buy stuff? They just don't even bother because they're like, you know, we lose money in the stock market. We definitely don't want to lose it in crypto.
00:31:40.414 - 00:32:12.928, Speaker A: So, you know, especially since we don't have insurance and the regulations still aren't clear. I don't care what Gary Gensler says, they're definitely not clear. There's a reason why lawyers in this space are not recommending to register or set up shop here. You know, which is a huge issue, I think. You know, it's funny, like, bitcoin arguably was started in the US. Eth was started in the US. Avalanche was started in the US.
00:32:12.928 - 00:32:41.492, Speaker A: Solana was started in the US. Everything starts here because that's where the innovation is and that's where the founders are so hungry and the opportunities are here. But we're just so scared. I mean, we were back in the day when the Internet came out. Like, the us government saw how this was. The Internet was the future and created laws that were favorable for startups to launch here. But on the crypto side, it's totally different because they see it as a threat to the dollar.
00:32:41.492 - 00:33:26.070, Speaker A: But I would argue it's a compliment, especially on the emerging market side as well. People want dollars, so what better way to strengthen the dollar than that? And that brings you to the emerging market side, too. We're definitely investors in that space. When it comes to markets like India, Africa, Latin America, the biggest use case right now is banking the unbanked. That's why also crypto was started as well, is allowing these people to transact and get access to financial products. And it's a huge market. And you see that even in this bear market, the growth is massive in these countries.
00:33:26.070 - 00:34:18.280, Speaker A: Products that offer basically converting your local currency to USDC and holding that and be able to transact with that, making remittances much easier as well, not having to use Western Union anymore. There's a huge amount of opportunity there, and there's a huge market to capture, and it is being captured by certain startups. And one interesting one that we've backed, it's called Fonbank. F o n b n K. Basically, they figured out how to turn airtime minutes into crypto and create an amm around that. So, say in most of the world, like, you pay basically by the minute, right? You don't pay upfront like we do here per month. And so, like, if you don't use all your minutes, you're kind of stuck with those extra minutes.
00:34:18.280 - 00:34:42.650, Speaker A: But here now they created a market for those unused minutes to be able to turn into crypto. So now you have effectively a bank account tied to airtime minutes and they've been growing massively. And it's the founder's based here as well. And so it just goes to show like, we're still very much the hub in this space.
00:34:43.150 - 00:35:04.508, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say even if the US kind of shoots itself in the foot long or short term, that over the long term they'll kind of self correct. Because just as you said, they set kind of favorable conditions for the Internet. And I mean, look how much like the Silicon Valley and tech space has really contributed to the US.
00:35:04.564 - 00:36:41.358, Speaker A: Yes, massive amounts of growth and wealth was created here from that and it can definitely happen again. The opportunity is here again in terms of just this brand new market, this new technology that's, you know, basically landed on our doorstep and, you know, it's just like, don't kick it out the door, bringing it inside, you know, definitely. And another thing too, I see is on the adoption side, and interestingly, right now, I mean, we don't, we're very picky about the gaming side of things because just from my background, I know how difficult it is to pick the winners in gaming just from years and years of research and also just building games, or I would say not games, but MVP's and just actual mini games of sorts just to see if they were fun. And on the gaming side, if the blockchain is on the underlayer, I think that's a way that you can get that discoverability factor where gamers can play the game for free, not even know it's on the blockchain, it's on Xbox or PlayStation or PC. And then they realize on their account, oh, my nfts are, or my gaming assets are worth how much? And then they could basically bridge to say whatever the Defi chain is that's connected through a certain bridge or if it's an in house bridge, and then sell their assets that way. Because gamers right now are still very much anti crypto and anti NFT.
00:36:41.414 - 00:36:42.610, Speaker B: Why do you think that is?
00:36:44.190 - 00:37:37.490, Speaker A: So if you know anything about the gaming space gamers have always felt like they've been screwed over by the big companies. Microtransactions, battle passes, dlcs that cost just as much of the game but for a 10th of the gameplay time. And so, excuse me, they're very off put by anything new. So they're very conservative, I would say, in that regard, and rightfully so, I think. But they're missing the key point about blockchain tech, and rightfully so. They've seen all these scam projects that have come out like these PFPs and they see actually how it costs $2,000. Right to be skeptical and right to be mad, right.
00:37:37.490 - 00:37:57.882, Speaker A: But they're missing the key point, which is that all it is really is just a fiat off ramp. Right. For your game assets now. Because if you talk to any game developer, what's the one thing that they hate building the most? It's the marketplaces. They want to build the game. They don't want to build the marketplace at all. They could give two shits about that.
00:37:57.882 - 00:38:46.890, Speaker A: It's why you look at steam. And if, if you've, if you've had a Steam account for as long as I have, the marketplace hasn't changed. It has not changed. I, before when I was in college, it still looks the same like, and I have, I think I'm a dota player, which I would argue is way better than the lead. So that was probably like the one red, the biggest red flag for Sam Bankman Fried was that it was a league player. But I have like a, just from playing it for so many years, I have like $2,000 worth of dota assets that, you know, I probably shouldn't have bought, you know, is thinking they would be worth something. But I can only exchange them for Steam bucks and then only exchange those for other games or battle passes or such.
00:38:46.890 - 00:39:24.772, Speaker A: I can't turn that into cash unless I go through like a third party which is not supported by Steam. I risk of getting my money stolen or my assets stolen. And if Valve finds out that you're selling those or you sold your account, you could get that account just taken away. You can get blocked. So they do that for legal reasons as well too, on that side because they would have to provide tax documents, they would have to provide KyC AML. And so it's better for them to off put it to some other third party. But that's why crypto is so great.
00:39:24.772 - 00:40:11.118, Speaker A: They don't have to worry about the tax side of things. They leave it to the user. Then the user goes to another chain, sells their assets or sells it on the chain that say if they have a private chain, say if it's an avalanche subnet, it could bridge it to the c chain, sell it there. And then the user has to worry about the tax documents. They don't have to worry about the KYC AMl. They're like, well, it wasn't sold on our marketplace, it was sold on a third party marketplace where, you know, we're fine and they can still tie in the royalties there and everything. So I think it's just gamers just need to see an actual great game that's built by, you know, whether it's x AAA guys or a current AAA studio and just see it work.
00:40:11.118 - 00:40:43.470, Speaker A: Because right now, all the big game studios that we're seeing, that we've talked to, we've talked to a bunch of them, especially on the advisory side too. Like, we have a bunch of clients that are notable game studios. They're still trying to figure it out too. And still, it's still very much an R and D style market for them. Just seeing what works because they see the potential and they see how it could be. It eventually is going to, if they don't do it, someone else is going to eat their lunch. It's just like back in the Internet, if you don't buy us, we're going to buy you.
00:40:43.470 - 00:40:47.290, Speaker A: So that's how I see it.
00:40:48.310 - 00:41:20.202, Speaker B: The gaming space is super interesting just from the fact that looking at the metrics that there's so low, millions of users and even the most popular applications and one game could onboard, even with Reddit, Reddit kind of using Polygon having bringing a couple million new wallet addresses where people really don't know. And on the gaming side, I mean, one popular game can bring in tens of millions of users into web3, effectively like doubling it or tripling it.
00:41:20.346 - 00:41:58.150, Speaker A: Yeah, especially if it's an app chain too. And you're just the backend is just creating a wallet address for you. Like you have your Ubisoft login creates a wallet address tied to your account, you know, that's effectively a new user. Right. And if it's, you know, an app chain where they control the gas and such, it's very cheap on the operational side for them. So I think it, it makes sense. And in this middle period that we're in, it's a great way to onboard new users and help them learn the space because, you know, the learning curve is just still too damn high, especially on the defi side.
00:41:59.730 - 00:42:16.190, Speaker B: Yeah, it is all complex. But on the app chain front, I know you and the Republic team are big fans. Can you share a little bit more about what's the driving thesis behind app chains, why you're so excited about them and what you're looking forward to in that space?
00:42:16.730 - 00:43:16.840, Speaker A: Yeah. So on our side, we're very much chain agnostic, but, you know, there are some chains that we're more privy to and we're more excited about in terms of just their potential on the app chain side. It's exciting for us from on the consumer standpoint, because it allows, you know, sort of better, better, better ui and ux, I would say potential there. Like for instance, Avalanche, for instance, and the Avalabs team, they're building out these suite of products that make it are making it effectively easier for the user to come in and understand. Like Core Wallet just released an update where you don't have to change what RPC you're on in order to interact with, say, and approve a transaction. It just knows what RPC you're on. And then Bob's your uncle, you're transacting.
00:43:16.840 - 00:44:33.720, Speaker A: On the legal side too. The app chains are interesting because it adds more utility to your token in the form of gas. And that's super beneficial, I think, in terms of just where we are on the regulation side, adding more utility and not less. It just being a governance token is, I think, not the best route to go forward. It's obviously on the appstream side, a higher difficulty to start up because it's more cash as well, because decentralized systems are expensive for developers. But if you can do it, I think adding that utility to your token on that front is hugely beneficial and helps protect you on the legal side of things. And there's also more flexibility for the developers and being able to pivot your UI and Ux in order to interact with your own chain and effectively, it's like you have more control, I would say, which is sort of like a no no thing to say in crypto, but for me, decentralization just means censorship resistant in a Nutshell.
00:44:34.140 - 00:45:21.660, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I mean, the industry as a whole really didn't have the language to be able to communicate a lot of these things until recently, and I'd still say now, they're still not super well understood. And so just being able to have a common framework to even speak about these things is a massive leap, especially on the decentralization front. But app chains too. One thing that I've been super surprised by is just how many people kind of want to mess with the consensus layer and tailor that to their own needs. And so it's been fascinating just talking recently with people in the avalanche ecosystem, people in Cosmos, and how they're planning to kind of tailor these individual app chains or subnets to their needs.
00:45:22.600 - 00:46:31.870, Speaker A: If you look at an image, say, of like Cosmos, I forget what the URL is, but you can see all them connected, it looks like the Internet. If you look at an image of the subnets on Avalanche, it looks like the Internet. You can just see it being built out where think of these actions like a website, where then you could say, go to one website, a financial Internet of sorts, where your money is just able to go from one website to the next. And it makes it just thinking about that from just a retail user perspective and how it could be so easy and just easier to understand for users as well, I think is where we're going. Also, you can see that just from the composability side of things. Like we didn't do Eigen layer, but I'm actually upset we didn't because to me it's like app change for ETH, which is super exciting, I think in terms of just helping with the fragmented liquidity side. If they build out some sort of messaging side where you can basically go from l two to l two.
00:46:31.870 - 00:47:12.266, Speaker A: Because right now there's so many l two s in the space where you just get basically overwhelmed by how many there are and you're just like, which one is going to win? Like, for me, it's on the Zk side. If I'm Polygon, I don't view Solana as my competitor. I view all the other zks as my competitor. If I'm a new user coming in, I hear Ethereum is the way to go. That's the nation I want to back. What l two do I choose? I'm just thinking about from my mom's perspective. I tell her, you got to go on Ethereum, but Ethereum is too costly.
00:47:12.266 - 00:47:51.578, Speaker A: You got to go on an l two. God forbid if, like, I'm being held up by, like, you know, at gunpoint, and they're like, you got to do this or Brian dies, I'm dead. Like, there's just no way. And so for me, it's like, you know, you see like ZK saying, talking about l three s and such. I feel like there needs to be like this overlay where much like a financial proctor, financial advisor, like, you kind of pick the parameters and it chooses for you. Like, I care more about privacy, I care more about gas fees. My investment sentiment is more risk averse.
00:47:51.578 - 00:48:48.122, Speaker A: Or I want to be more of a dgen. You pick those and it kind of would choose for you. And I think that's probably the way we're going to go, where you don't even know what chain you're on generally. If you pick your home is eth or your home is Solana, or your home is avalanche, or there might even be a layer on top of that where it picks one of the l one layers for you. Because to me, all these chains are like nations, I feel, because it's not like a web browser like you had Netscape and it was very easy to just switch over to Firefox, very easy then to switch over to Google Chrome. People have money tied into these ecosystems and that's why certain chains just don't die where they've had their chance, right. You know, billions of dollars locked up in like, swap takes six minutes.
00:48:48.122 - 00:48:51.410, Speaker A: Like, okay, let's time to move along.
00:48:51.490 - 00:48:53.594, Speaker B: You know, I agree.
00:48:53.682 - 00:49:26.420, Speaker A: I mean, I give it, you know, all, you know, power to the community there. But I think we, you know, we need to move away from this religious sentiment on chains, right? Obviously some tech is better and obviously we're going to be multi chain because if you don't want to be one nation and you don't want to be stuck to that chain, like if you would disagree with the way a certain chain is going, the governance is going, you can move to a new one. So you definitely need multiple chains, but you don't need all these.
00:49:27.520 - 00:50:09.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's been super interesting to me just talking with a lot of the layer one founders and L2s and their different ecosystems and the different kind of small technical nuances that and how they manifest themselves from one, a product standpoint, but also a developer standpoint. And they are complex. I don't know. I think eventually how I see it playing out is a majority of users and developers will kind of just coalesce into a specific ecosystem in most part because there's a lot of, a lot of activity there. But it is hard to say.
00:50:11.720 - 00:51:09.510, Speaker A: No, you're right about that, especially being a developer. Many years ago, on my side, self taught, learning c was one of the hardest things in life. And I remember when me and my friend were like, you know, maybe we should shift over to unity because that's more better for mobile games. I was like, oh shit, that's c sharp. But it's still part of the same family, the C family. I was like, all right, I guess it's fine. I just remember thinking and being so overwhelmed by just a new language that I think about it too, in terms of the devs in our space now, how many dsls we have and all the different evms, not vms, and you have solidity obviously is the most popular language now, 300,000 devs on that side, but still talking, I don't know how often you talk to devs on that side, but still you hear a lot of like, I guess it's as good as we got right now.
00:51:09.510 - 00:52:00.354, Speaker A: But that's why also you had the flock move to rust because developers love that language in this space and you also have the web, you know, the wasm VMs coming out of the woodwork. I remember talking to one of the early eth devs huge rust fan and I won't say his name just so he doesn't get any backlash, but not a solidity fan. And interesting enough, he thinks the, the wasm VM is made. Whether it's five or ten years from now, it's going to be the vm that wins. So it's definitely curious. Interesting. It makes me curious what projects that are come out that enable developers to build much easier using.
00:52:00.482 - 00:52:31.100, Speaker B: I agree on that front. Going forward into 2023, obviously now we're in a year plus Bear market, things have reset from the builder side, also the valuation side. People are having a little bit more time to think about what works, what doesn't work. What are you looking forward to in the rest of 2023 that gets you excited?
00:52:31.680 - 00:53:36.414, Speaker A: Yeah, well one thing I'm really looking forward to is there is this game studio that we invested in and their game is supposed to launch in Q two. All games get pushed back. Don't take my word for it that it's launching in Q two, but I'm super excited for that game to launch or for their first game to launch because they just have a history of launching great games. The last game that they made made a billion dollars in five years and that game was launched ten years ago and today that game still has 2000 daily active players on Steam alone. And they just know how to launch games and their team is just stellar and they basically built, they tried out every chain you could think of in terms of a test environment for what could handle. They chose avalanche for the subnet side because it gave them more flexibility. Private meets public, they can control the gas, make it feel just like a web two experience and not have the users to worry about their wallet.
00:53:36.414 - 00:54:30.832, Speaker A: And they could build a companion app where they could see their game assets, their nfts and send it to their, you know, their seachain wallet if they want to. They, I play the game. It's so freaking fun and I think it's just going to be another wave of possibly a couple hundred thousand million users just because of, you know, where I know they're launching and the, the partnerships that they're getting. It'll come out, I think, later this month or early next month on, just more on the announcement and they're sending out some videos and such on their development. But that's one thing I'm excited about. Obviously a portfolio company, not investment advice. It's just something I'm personally excited about on the investment side.
00:54:30.832 - 00:56:02.120, Speaker A: I like it. And things we're looking at definitely still. I mean, infrastructure is just a, a basket word, but like, you know, on the rails and the tunnels that are needed in this space, making retail feel more comfortable onboarding, putting actual cash, you know, actual, you know, hard earned money into the space and investing in the space, I think, is we're still not there. And so, you know, cornerstone tech, I would call it, is like where it kind of blends all the chains together, making it feel just like one cohesive system where whether it's like ZK state proofs on the under layer that is able to see the arbitrage opportunities on a specific Dex or Amm and able to rebalance those pools in real time so that there's no more arbitrage and different slippages. And so it's more fair to the retail user and it can't be just abstracted by people who have large amounts of capital and mev bots. So stuff like that is very interesting to us. On the ZK touch side, even hardware, new chips are interesting to handle the compute for ZK API tech as well.
00:56:02.120 - 00:56:55.130, Speaker A: Being able to have devs use new API tools that making development of their project much easier. Some stuff is not obvious either too. It will come across our desk and we'll be like, holy shit, why didn't we think of this? And then we'll do a dive on the founders and on the tech side and sometimes we'll lead and sometimes we'll be follow on. But yeah, for the most part, I would say infrastructure and then also security as well. And then you kind of just got to wait for regulations and insurance to come about. So that also adds to the cushion of feeling cozy with retail.
00:56:55.670 - 00:56:56.582, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:56:56.766 - 00:56:57.182, Speaker A: Right.
00:56:57.246 - 00:58:01.342, Speaker B: What do you, what do you think about? Um, it's a good question. I mean, definitely on the infrastructure side, I think it was funny, like in the early nineties or late nineties, um, they spent so much money on infrastructure and just laying kind of the pipes for dialogue for broadband that once the.com crash, everybody was like, oh shit. Like we way over spent on how much money we spent on the infrastructure side of things. And I think we're kind of there today with some of blockchains that the people, because we're nowhere near the utilization of these new high throughput blockchains, but they have a lot of bandwidth that they can, can continue to add. So I'm personally really excited about applications that are able to use more of these high throughput low latency networks and consume more of their bandwidth. Like actually scale.
00:58:01.342 - 00:58:26.780, Speaker B: I do think gaming on the gaming side it's interesting just from the user onboarding perspective. I was also surprised by, I mean it kind of makes sense with Electric Capital's report that 80% or so of new wallets that interacted with interacted on chain. Their first interaction was an NFT, which is wild.
00:58:27.280 - 00:58:30.260, Speaker A: Yeah, that is wild. It makes sense too.
00:58:30.680 - 00:58:42.670, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean the NFT thing personally caught me off guard. I was super excited when DeFi Summer was happening on Ethan. Uh, but yeah, nfts kind of came out of left field for me.
00:58:43.370 - 00:59:10.566, Speaker A: Yeah, I. Did you collect Beanie babies back in the day? Well I'm aging myself then. It wasn't that long ago. But um, it I, you know it's not like Beanie Babies. And I remember my, I got, my friend started yelling at me who has a NFT project about it. But I mean there's obviously more utility to nfts than Beanie babies. But it was the idea of scarcity, right.
00:59:10.566 - 00:59:52.600, Speaker A: You know it's like there's so, only so many blue elephants out there and you know that blue elephant could pay for college one day. So you know it's. And that made sense to retail, right. And so that's why they hopped in on that early. You want to own this piece of history, right? And you know it's, we need more stuff like that that just makes sense in clicks for retail. I mean it's going to be harder to, for the financial products because we're selling new financial products to the over financed in the western world, right. So it's about making it easier, safer, not safer, but adjust as safe and more efficient than the traditional system that we have.
00:59:52.600 - 01:00:48.304, Speaker A: And we're getting there. We're getting there too. Especially security tokens are around the corner. I feel especially on our parent co side, it's definitely something that we're focusing on in the private side. You know, one thing, it's definitely too early, but you know, us being big investors on aerospace and defense, there are some space companies that are you know, experimenting the idea of like how blockchain can be integrated on their, on the tech side. So like if you're, you know, we invested in company that is building a space station, a new space station, and they're teetering around the idea of how it can work and imagine running nodes in space or securing satellite data on the blockchain or having private chains for certain governments. And definitely still too early.
01:00:48.304 - 01:00:56.686, Speaker A: But lots of things, every industry is thinking about it though, which is something to be bullish on.
01:00:56.878 - 01:01:12.250, Speaker B: I agree. I definitely agree. Maybe wrapping up the podcast is there. I've kind of. Originally I started doing the spicy questions, but then got out of the habit of doing like hot ones a little bit. That'd be fun. Yeah.
01:01:12.250 - 01:01:26.960, Speaker B: What I mean, are there any like particularly kind of like, point of view that you and the team like strongly hold that you just don't believe the market either sees Orlando, that you think is just wrong on?
01:01:28.380 - 01:01:33.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I mean, it's going to make a.
01:01:33.812 - 01:01:37.364, Speaker B: Lot of people angry, but that's why it's spicy.
01:01:37.492 - 01:02:31.720, Speaker A: I also don't care if you look at the top charts in crypto, there's too many coins that just should not be there. Obviously the meme coins are fun, but they have no value at all to the space and it just really just ends up just draining people's wallets, in my opinion. If you have to be early and then you're basically someone else's liquidity at the end of the day, if you're just a late comer. There are also some chains that had their chance, in my opinion. I'm not going to say them just out of respect, but people know who they are. And a swap should not take six minutes to swap between a token. I'm sorry, with all the.
01:02:31.720 - 01:03:02.690, Speaker A: With Solana just being a blink of an eye, it should not take six minutes. I don't care how much into the math you are. No. And like, no vc worth their salt is investing in those chains as well. There's certain chains that just like, we don't touch. I just don't want to be the first person to come out and say it because I feel like, you know, I'm very much on the side of, you know, just like evolution, it'll kind of just get weeded out. Yeah.
01:03:02.690 - 01:03:32.160, Speaker A: And, you know, tech, the great, but also like, the best tech doesn't always win. Like, you know, like JavaScript was like, you know, that's the language of the web. It's not the best language, but it won, but it has to work. That's the thing. Some of these changes don't work. And also, if you talk to anyone that provides data in the crypto space. All these chains are just fake transactional data.
01:03:32.160 - 01:03:53.080, Speaker A: Everyone's saying, like, oh, look, how many transactions do you have? I'm sorry. I know you're spoofing the blockchain. I know that your fees are so low that you can just spoof it, you know, so stop paying attention to transaction data. Stop paying attention to development data. We don't know. Nobody knows. Especially when you have all these app chains.
01:03:53.080 - 01:04:22.050, Speaker A: You know, I would say there are some, you know, real folks that are, you know, have their chains in the space that actually are. The data is, I would say, you know, close to real. But there are some chains that are definitely spoofing their data. I'm not going to say who, but it's pretty obvious you know, who they are.
01:04:24.670 - 01:04:35.102, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, you can leave it at. Yeah, it's good. It's good. I like the space he takes. It makes things interesting. But no, really appreciate you coming on the podcast, Brian.
01:04:35.102 - 01:04:59.558, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for kind of giving background all the things that you're interested, how you guys started Republic, thoughts on how the last bull market went, how you're looking into specific areas of focus, gaming, app chains, super interesting conversation, and I.
01:04:59.574 - 01:05:05.220, Speaker A: Always love you, dude. Yeah, thanks, dude. This was a great birthday so far. Awesome.
01:05:05.920 - 01:05:10.940, Speaker B: Well, I hope you have a great birthday dinner, but again, appreciate you coming on the podcast.

01:05:13.816 - 01:05:16.336, Speaker B: Let's do it. Thanks.
01:05:16.368 - 01:05:18.216, Speaker A: I'll do another one. If you get 10,000.
01:05:18.408 - 01:05:19.144, Speaker B: That's good.
01:05:19.232 - 01:05:21.640, Speaker A: I don't think. Bye.
