00:00:00.400 - 00:00:01.020, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:00:01.790 - 00:00:04.414, Speaker B: Thanks. Appreciate the setup here.
00:00:04.542 - 00:00:24.766, Speaker A: Yeah, I been trying to do the podcast stuff. It's a little bit more difficult once you get all the equipment and try to do it legitly. So I appreciate your patience and your time, but, yeah, maybe just start off, like a quick intro on who you are and we can roll from there.
00:00:24.958 - 00:00:58.276, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm Justin. I am on the Solana Ventures team, generally focusing on the sort of core verticals of defi, infra, and gaming. I've been in the crypto space since, really, 2015. Kind of got my official start in 2017. Yeah, definitely on the earlier side, and unfortunately missed the opportunity to get in in 2013, 2014, just because, like, most other people chalked it off to not being something of value until really doing the research. And that's kind of what I tell people.
00:00:58.276 - 00:01:11.100, Speaker B: It's just like, anyone who I think has really, like, if you've really done your research and gone down the rabbit hole, like, and you still aren't bullish on crypto and, like, what the value is to the world, it's like, I don't know. I don't know what else there's to say at that point.
00:01:11.220 - 00:01:19.236, Speaker A: I just don't think people have gone far enough. Yeah, yeah. It's hard to go down the rabbit hole and not be convinced on the other side.
00:01:19.348 - 00:01:41.616, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And on my end, just kind of. Kind of had a background. Doing, like, was pretty entrepreneurial, had kind of, like, started the first company that. That I had when I was just some basic sort of, like, e commerce websites and things like that. And so I was always interested in tech and in finance, and so, you know, was kind of just a natural fit for me once I got into it. And I.
00:01:41.616 - 00:02:13.964, Speaker B: And I do want to take the opportunity to shout out my professor, Professor Neil, who actually was the guy who really formally got me into crypto, essentially, you know, had overheard me having a conversation about businesses that I had had and tech startups and. And just sort of that intersection between finance and tech. And I was like, hey, if you're interested in that stuff, you should take another look at crypto. And I was a little bit skeptical at first, but came back a few days later and was like, dude, I haven't slept, so it's been awesome. And once I was down the rabbit hole, there's no going back for me.
00:02:14.052 - 00:02:18.924, Speaker A: So was that so you got in 20, 1415, you said?
00:02:19.012 - 00:02:30.786, Speaker B: Yeah, like, 1516. So 15. I was starting to look into it, but not really. I wouldn't consider myself knowledgeable. I just kind of you know, I'd heard about things. I had some friends who were around it, but nothing. Nothing too much.
00:02:30.786 - 00:03:53.976, Speaker B: And then 2016, that that professor got me into it. And then from then on, there was. There's pretty much no going back. Spent, like, the next few weeks, just, like, you know, being up all night doing research and not. Not paying too much attention, fortunately, to my schoolwork at the time, and just thinking, how do I actually make this something that I can do full time? And then essentially started getting into day trading and just, like, spending all my time doing crypto stuff and decided that summer, I was like, look, I could get an internship or try to do something, like, there, or just get a basic job at an ice cream shop or whatever other people do after sort of, like, their freshman year of college, and was like, actually, I feel like for me, I'd rather take the route of just sort of day trading and doing research all day and putting out research, and at worst, I would get my name out there and learn about what it takes to be successful in finance and in crypto specifically, and at best, come out of it with some money as well. And so summer of 2016, and I really was just diving in super hard, started a non twitter account, started interacting with people there, and really was just sort of day trading out of, basically my parents basement, essentially in suburban New York. End of that summer thought, hey, I really like this trading.
00:03:53.976 - 00:04:33.858, Speaker B: I think I'm doing well. Maybe the best course of action for me is to try to get an internship at a bank or do something like that. And so that summer essentially went down to one of the large banks on Wall street and was essentially trying to pitch myself as a trader. And more questions. And the deeper that we got on, the more of these guys are realizing, like, hey, he actually kind of knows what he's talking about around this crypto stuff. Doing an internship would be cool, but maybe there's something else here. And so by the end of that sort of meeting, they actually offered me the opportunity to take a few hundred grand in seed capital and really just, like, start a formal fund.
00:04:33.858 - 00:05:06.182, Speaker B: And I wasn't sure how serious they were, but, like, lo and behold, got back to the suburbs, and one of the guys on that desk, like, the managing director, actually had, like, called my dad and was like, hey, your son should seriously consider taking time off of school to do something full time here. Cause it's such a nascent space. And so after that, you know, things moved pretty quickly, essentially, you know, told USC, which is my alma, that, like, I would. I would actually be delaying coming back and. And really just, you know, decided to dive full time into crypto.
00:05:06.286 - 00:05:12.654, Speaker A: That's fucking crazy. They gave you the money. And so was that before the 2017 bull market or after?
00:05:12.742 - 00:05:47.912, Speaker B: So that was basically like, lining up with that. Exactly. So a situation where they had actually just started hearing about crypto because it was like, around that summer of 2017 when something started really popping off and, like, mainstream world really started to take notice. And they were like, look, like we want to get on this fast. What do we have to do to, like, to buy crypto ourselves? And I was telling them how, like, you know, it's the safest thing is to use a hardware wallet and this and that. And they're like, oh, God, like, we don't want to deal with that at all. Like, can you just trade this for us and keep up with the stuff that's moving in the market and just give us updates? And I was like, yeah, I mean, that works for me.
00:05:47.912 - 00:06:04.752, Speaker B: I'm willing to take the chance there. And I was certainly bullish, obviously, on the space. So, yeah, I really got started formally about September 2017, officially opened the fund. It was called New Block Capital. And, yeah, name there is pretty simple, right? It's just new block.
00:06:04.776 - 00:06:05.088, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:06:05.144 - 00:06:48.796, Speaker B: I like it. It has since actually been copied by a few different news sources as well as other funds and things like that. But who am I to run after them at this point? But, yeah, so essentially got started then and really was getting launched at a time where crypto was just, like, really exploding. So it was a super exciting first few months and really was just like a ton of volatility in the market. A lot of trading opportunities wasn't really going with just purely because I wasn't sure about sort of the regulatory environment. I was trying to stay away purposely from things like icos, but mostly just trading liquid tokens and trying to get in sort of at the earlier stages, waiting a portfolio of kind of the top assets that I liked in the space.
00:06:48.908 - 00:07:02.218, Speaker A: That's nuts. I was also class of 2017. I did not know too much prior to that bull run. My brother kept bugging me. He was like, hey, this crypto shit's cool. And I was like, dude, like, I can't look at this right now. I'm busy.
00:07:02.218 - 00:07:16.258, Speaker A: And it just kept going up. Ultimately learned a lot, but I got pretty wrecked during that bear market. How did going into 2018 go for you?
00:07:16.434 - 00:07:57.174, Speaker B: Yeah, so kind of like unrelated to where market the markets were at the time. Kind of had this sit down conversation with my parents where end of 2017, market was doing well. Fund was doing well, but really had this conversation with them when they were like, look like you're 18. This stuff is going great, but we've seen how volatile it is day to day, even especially month to month. And so for your long term future, you have to go to college. We're making you go. My parents were just very adamant about that, and so they said, what would you rather do? Would you rather go back now and try to figure out some way to do both of these at once, or would you rather kind of go back? Who knows when that bull run would end? Maybe when you're 25, maybe when you're 30.
00:07:57.174 - 00:09:01.610, Speaker B: Who knows? And for me, I was always been someone that thinks that balance in life is critical. And so as much fun as it is to be able to do crypto stuff, I also know that there's a huge amount of value in just developing socially and getting to have these experiences that you can have in college. And so made the decision basically at the start of 2018 that I would go back to school and kind of continue running the funds sort of from a passive perspective, and that coincidentally just seemed to line up with when a bear market started in 2018. So ended up working out that I went back to school and was at USC kind of doing what I was doing, going to classes, but then also doing this on the side and just keeping up with the crypto market and sort of had this push during that time where I was like, look, crypto right now has kind of had a little, you know, maybe it makes sense for me to do something more on the Troudfi side. Maybe this is just sort of a skillset that I've learned that I can transition. So spent some time doing some internships. I did one at Millennium management here in New York.
00:09:01.690 - 00:09:02.146, Speaker A: Nice.
00:09:02.258 - 00:09:13.610, Speaker B: Which is like a big. Yeah. Quant hedge fund, and then one as well at where I, you know, at my alma mater at USC on their endowment team, working mostly on Luther VC and PE strategies.
00:09:13.690 - 00:09:14.274, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:09:14.402 - 00:10:08.944, Speaker B: With all these sort of, like, other roles, I would kind of always circle back to crypto. So I'd always be like, oh, I'd overhear something in a meeting, like, how are we gonna validate this? And it would always be like, well, I know one way. And so over time, it just constantly got to the point where I was like, look, even at these tradfi jobs, I keep circling back to being the crypto instructor, being the guy driving a crypto initiative. And so I think long term makes more sense for me. To just do something in crypto full time. And so I was graduating just a few years back, and essentially was looking at what I wanted to do after graduation, decided that the best path for me was really to be on the research side and just to get my name out there as a Kol and try to add some legitimacy to the points I was making and things like that. So I actually ended up joining a company called the tie, and essentially they're building a research product and also sort of a Bloomberg terminal esque piece of software for institutions.
00:10:08.944 - 00:11:15.882, Speaker B: And so was writing really just long form research on different l one S and l two s gaming, did some pieces on Axie and Polygon, some of these other things that thankfully were able to get reshared and get referenced in some big magazines or whatever you call them, but crypto publications, essentially. And so around that time, it also started getting into Solana and essentially was in communication with some members of the team here, asking them questions about Solana and trying to learn more. And somehow the conversation came up like, hey, I might be looking to make a move and do something, either continuing on the research side for an l one or l two, or doing something on the investment side and kind of going back to my roots on the crypto investment side. And so first, not too many responses there, but after a few weeks, started getting some strong responses and some good opportunities and ended up just being that I really connected with Ben Spirango, who's our current head of strategy. And he was like, hey, we're sorry. Head of BD now essentially was like, hey, you know, we have something. You know, it'd be great if you come in and interview.
00:11:15.882 - 00:11:26.322, Speaker B: And from there, it was a pretty quick process. I think we clicked pretty quickly, and everyone on the team and I think had a sort of similar perspective on crypto. And so it just sort of worked out.
00:11:26.426 - 00:11:47.056, Speaker A: That's crazy. I'm jealous of your path. It seems like. I mean, you obviously put yourself in the correct positions with your different background. You had the desire to learn crypto fairly early on and go super deep. And then I kind of put yourself in the position from the research standpoint to get your name out. That's sick.
00:11:47.056 - 00:11:48.616, Speaker A: That's a super cool story. Yeah.
00:11:48.648 - 00:12:18.220, Speaker B: And, like, also, it's, you know, it was partially to get my name out. And then another part of it as well was just, like, for myself to just know that, like, I fully understood it to the point where, like, I could post things online and be confident that I could do deep dives that people weren't going to, like, that. People weren't going to shit on and, like, pull apart and, like, thankfully, the responses to, like, the research pieces that I were putting out were really good and really didn't have too many, like, critiques coming in. So to me, that was just, like, confirmation on my end that I was doing something that was good and valuable with community.
00:12:18.340 - 00:12:29.960, Speaker A: Yeah, that's sick. So I'm curious, what specifically got you excited about Solana versus other projects or things in the space?
00:12:30.300 - 00:13:30.940, Speaker B: Yeah. So for me, being that I had done a few sort of Internet businesses before my dad actually came from sort of the startup world and Internet bubble, the nineties, I had a very good, I think, understanding of how important ux UI is for the average consumer and for something to become mainstream. And so it spent a lot of time in ethereum, obviously, because that was the only thing, really, at that point in sort of, like, 2017. 2016. But I'd always kind of felt that in order to actually have sort of, like, the right consumer experience to reach mass market, something had to change, like, whether that was scaling solution, whether that was another l one or l two. And so I really hadn't seen something that, to me, was sort of as powerful as the onboarding and user experience that I've seen on Solana. And so kind of immediately after doing a few transactions on places, like, on serum, and, like, playing around with different stuff across the Solana ecosystem, it was very clear to me that there was something here that I just hadn't seen before.
00:13:30.940 - 00:13:45.804, Speaker B: And so it just became, everything that was going on just became super interesting. And then tie that in with kind of what happened during sort of this, like, Defi Solana summer that we had last year. It was just kind of the perfect storm of me saying, like, okay, I need to figure out a way to get into this ecosystem.
00:13:45.892 - 00:14:18.990, Speaker A: Yeah, that's nuts. No, it's super cool. I'm always curious, like, how people choose, like, which projects to work on, because, I mean, the space moves so quickly and everything is happening so fast, and there's so many different opportunities. Trying to, like, pick the correct one and just, like, go super deep on that one can be a challenge. So that's super neat. So, I mean, from your research side now kind of joining or being on the Solana team, I guess I'm more curious, like, what you're excited about currently.
00:14:19.490 - 00:15:02.302, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we've got so many areas that I'm super excited about, obviously. I think Defi on Solana is, like, the area. I think that, honestly, gets the most attention still. And we have a ton of incredibly, incredibly interesting DeFi projects that are launching and have launched recently. But like, one area that I think is pretty often overlooked is just Solana gaming in general. And I think that's partially due to sort of the network and just as a result of like, what the network enables with microtransactions and things to actually be on chain that before were too expensive to be on chain or too slow. But also it's really just like how I see gaming is that you have DeFi products and a massive success in DeFi could be 5 million users.
00:15:02.302 - 00:15:27.294, Speaker B: Like, that's a huge right. Having a Dex with 5 million users is massive. In gaming, you can have a game that reaches a billion people. There's been games that have reached a billion people plus. And so what I see about gaming that's so exciting is just this ability for explosive, explosive virality. And we saw that on ETh with Axie really in the last year or so. But I think there's just so much more that's going to happen in there.
00:15:27.294 - 00:15:54.244, Speaker B: And so for me, gaming is one of the key and honestly easiest ways that we see crypto getting to the masses. And so I'm super excited about a bunch of games that are launching, both announced and unannounced at this point. But I think really the coolest thing is just being able to talk with sort of like traditional studios and people who build games in web two that are actually saying like, wow, now it finally makes sense for us to actually try to make a move on blockchain.
00:15:54.332 - 00:16:25.948, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree. And I think, I mean, especially like being built on Solana with the low latency and like having the super high throughput, it's now. And with a combination of like the game studios that are like experts at like actually building games, because that's just like completely, or can be completely separate from like the underlying technology of like the blockchain infrastructure. But marrying those two, I totally agree. I'm super excited about like how many people those can bring on.
00:16:26.124 - 00:16:41.452, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's awesome. And like, the craziest thing about gaming too is it's like a universal language, right? Like, you don't need to be someone who has a math background, you don't need to be someone who's used to trading. You can have a twelve year old that's playing, you can have a 50 year old that's playing, and they can both equally enjoy a great game.
00:16:41.556 - 00:17:27.209, Speaker A: Oh, for sure. And I think, I mean, jumping off that point, I was super interested in the defi stuff going in 2020 on ethereum with, like, composability and all the stuff that was happening there. And I was, like, geeking out about, like, uniswap and, like, compound, and I was, like, trying to show them to all my friends, but none of them, like, really liked it. And I was super surprised because I was geeking out about it so much. But what interested them was NFTs and specifically on Solana because the gas fees were super cheap and it was something that they could just enjoy and be a part of the community. So I curious, like, how you kind of think about, like, NFTs as a whole and like, yeah, yeah.
00:17:27.249 - 00:18:13.180, Speaker B: I mean, I think the first thing is, like, I do think that there are, like, a bunch of misconceptions around nfTs, even still in sort of the mainstream community. So, like, these ideas, like, nfts are bad for the environment and, like, you know, there's nothing behind them and, like, all this stuff. And, you know, I definitely think sort of the first iteration of NFTs is sort of, like, you know, PFP, very basic. Like, arthem, you know, art in its purest form, right? And art is obviously nothing new. There's a huge market for art around the world. But what really excites me about nfts is, like, some of the utility things that people are including with them, whether that's gating to different communities or special events or giving you pro rata rights to tokens or, like, all these different amazing things that people are doing with nfts that are way beyond, just like, here's my jpeg. And I just like how it looks for sure.
00:18:13.180 - 00:18:56.716, Speaker B: You know, on that end, I think that's, that's awesome. And then on the art side, I think it's incredible. And I've seen this firsthand with, like, artist friends of mine who have kind of converted into web3 artists over time is, like, for an artist, the ability to earn sort of on chain or, you know, similarly on chain royalties from, you know, ongoing sales is huge because, like, artists many times just happen to be, like, extremely. They're like, there's a lot of opportunities where artists are extorted, sort of. Bye. Both the traditional art world and just society as a whole, right? So they put out something amazing. Maybe they sell it for $1,000, and then 50 years down the line, okay, now it's worth $10 million, but they don't get a piece of it, right? And so the idea that's like, I think so.
00:18:56.716 - 00:19:12.518, Speaker B: Powerful for artists now is this ability to put out a piece of art that's provably yours and then earn, you know, royalties for that indefinitely is massive. And I think, like, there's no way that artists in the future don't see a major trade off when they do physical artwork, in the fact that they won't be able to get that exposure.
00:19:12.644 - 00:19:43.040, Speaker A: No, I totally agree. And I think, I mean, a lot of artists still don't know about the royalties aspect, and it's cool to see that your artist friends are now, like, understanding that. And, I mean, it's kind of like, I mean, crypto in the sense, like, once you see it, you're like, oh, yes, that's obvious. It should definitely be done. And with the royalties, just having that continuous revenue stream is. Is massive. No, that's super cool.
00:19:43.040 - 00:20:03.268, Speaker A: So we touched upon your background, touched upon gaming a little bit on defi and NFts. Are those the main things that are exciting you over the next couple months or anything else that you're particularly interested or more on a high level?
00:20:03.404 - 00:20:46.548, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the thing for me is I'm, you know, whether I'm just a crypto, maxi, and everything's gonna always excite me. I don't know. But basically every area of crypto right now is super exciting to me. I mean, you even take something like, sort of like fiat on ramps and off ramps, and, like, that process has gone from, okay, no average person can understand how I'm gonna buy crypto and send it here and do all these things to, like, now it's getting slowly easier and easier. Services like transact, Moonpay, you know, wire, et cetera, that are just making it, like, really simple for people to buy crypto with, like, credit and debit card. And I sort of see that as, like, one of the other sort of major turning points within the crypto ecosystem is making it easier for the average consumer to get involved in. Crypto is huge, and there's still a ways to go.
00:20:46.548 - 00:20:54.524, Speaker B: But the difference between how many steps it took to get into crypto in 2017, 2016, and now is impossible to even compare.
00:20:54.572 - 00:21:18.800, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. No, I mean, I remember even trying to buy crypto on Coinbase back in 2017 and just, like, getting approved took, like, a couple weeks. You couldn't really buy anything of size. It was crazy. So, yeah, today's infrastructure is much, much better than it was in the past. Yeah.
00:21:19.180 - 00:22:05.340, Speaker B: On that point of infrastructure, too. I also am at Salon Adventures investing in the infra vertical, and there's a ton of really interesting stuff going on, especially in the analytics space. So, hello Moon is a company that we really like. They're building sort of a native Solana, almost a product like a nansen, but on Solana and the ability to actually have insight into sort of all the on chain interactions that you're seeing, especially on a network like Solana that's having billions and billions of transactions a year, it's like, it's incredibly useful, and it kind of helps really dispel this narrative of, like, crypto is anonymous. There's no way to trace things and actually puts it the other way and says, actually tracking the us dollar is hard. Tracking crypto now is just a matter of actually having the right tools.
00:22:05.420 - 00:23:05.796, Speaker A: Exactly. No, there's a lot of things that I think the mass majority believe, but are kind of still misconceptions. And I'm excited that over time, those will be able to kind of be disproven as more and more people come into the ecosystem. And, yeah, essentially just kind of removing some of that fear and uncertainty about the ecosystem. One of the things I'm, like, been super excited by is just, like, how Solana scales and how engineers are kind of bottlenecked by, or in the past have been bottlenecked by the constraints of, like, the system. And I've been just, like, geeking out about Solana and, like, their scaling solution. But the capabilities that unlock, once you're not totally constrained by the underlying architecture, could you, like, touch upon, like, anything that you're, like, excited upon, like, and that's the standpoint?
00:23:05.948 - 00:24:07.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, the innovation that I've seen sort of internally and even publicly at Solana has been huge. I mean, you know, obviously we have these sort of high, high throughput, high throughput blockchain that everyone's excited about. But, like, the real use case behind that is huge, because if you think about bitcoin or you think about Ethereum and its current state, and you think about what it would take for those networks to actually scale to a truly global form of payments, it's daunting. It's going to be extremely difficult. And what's exciting about Solana is we can put out something like Solana pay that we did recently. And all of a sudden now there's actually a viable way for people to be making massive amounts of real life purchases. You know, simply using sort of just the underlying architecture that we already have and being able to do all that stuff without needing to do an l two or to do something on top of Solana is, I think, one of the most amazing things because it just doesn't introduce that whole other layer of complexity that I think we've seen in other ecosystems when it comes to, you know, to scaling, really.
00:24:07.782 - 00:24:31.140, Speaker A: I totally agree, and I love that Solana kind of abstracts all the engineering complexities and allows the application engineers to focus on the application. And then that, combined with, like, the composability, is where, like, a lot of magical stuff happens. Are there, like, any cool instances that you've seen recently of, like, applications composing on Solana?
00:24:31.960 - 00:24:58.322, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we've seen a ton. I mean, like, what I think is super cool is, like, especially out of these hackathons, and, you know, we're still today, we're shooting this on the last day of our riptide hackathon. So I'm sure there'll be many more projects. Yeah, but, yeah, I mean, like, in previous hackathons, we've seen projects that have said, you know, we're building on top of serum. Built, and then building on top of serum, which is. And then from that, building on top of psy options, and then from that, making our own product. Right.
00:24:58.322 - 00:25:26.466, Speaker B: So it's like it's getting even another whole nother layer deeper, even than just we're building on Solana or just we're building on serum. It's like they're going multiple steps into it. And I think that's, like, incredible, because the truth is, like, if we want to move this space forward at, like, at the rate that that we want to, it's going to take some amount of teamwork. The ability for these teams to take open source code and be able to take that and then build something on top of that that even these original teams didn't foresee is an awesome feature.
00:25:26.618 - 00:26:19.196, Speaker A: 1000% to double click on this. While I was at Tesla, one of the things that I started geeking out again about was the composability aspect on Ethereum. And when Defi SUmmer was going on, I was like, even as hard as Tesla works, we work extremely hard, very long hours to try to make the best products. But you cannot compete with composability when applications plug and play to each other. And those innovations compound even just trying to work your ass off, you just can't beat that. I love that the Solana system is so composable and that the applications do stack on top of each other. It can plug and play because one that abstracts, like, the engineering building, you can just focus on more your core thing, and then anybody else can add to that.
00:26:19.196 - 00:26:26.068, Speaker A: So it is nuts. I'm very excited for that composability aspect over the next six months or so.
00:26:26.204 - 00:26:58.510, Speaker B: Yeah. And the thing with that is that's parabolic. Right? So it's just like, as people put out more stuff, it just keeps building on each other. Yeah, it's super awesome to see. And I sort of envision down the line that it's like these products become so robust that all of a sudden now institutions and traditional sort of web two companies have this ability to just come into the space and actually have to do very little of sort of their own building. It can almost just tweak sort of existing products that are already out there and immediately have this sort of working mass scale product from day one.
00:26:58.630 - 00:27:14.130, Speaker A: So we're filming live in the downstairs of the hacker house. So we're working with the background in other music, maybe just briefly touch upon like the kind of global view of crypto, and then we can wrap this up.
00:27:14.290 - 00:28:18.730, Speaker B: Yeah. So I've been blessed to be able to go to a bunch of these different hacker houses and things like breakpoint that we hosted in Lisbon and all these awesome events. And one thing that I think is super awesome is when you do get to have these international events, you really see how different cities just totally have a different sort of developer atmosphere. So whether it's like in LA, like, we saw a lot of devs that were highly focused on sort of media, right, gaming, music, all these areas that here in New York, I feel like I've seen a lot more defi focused people and things like that. And that's sort of a consequence of the city and the background of the people coming to the hacker houses. But what's amazing is when you think about that in the context of a global network like Solana is like, you have all these people from all these different places with these different backgrounds all working and building their own projects that are going in a million different directions. And so there's so many different ways that people are taking it that, like, there's no way to pin down sort of like what, you know, what the dominant direction almost of the network is because it's always shooting off and really like in a million different sort of promising directions at any one point.
00:28:18.850 - 00:28:46.902, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's interesting. Just like the geographical location kind of determines what people's interested and I mean, it totally makes sense, but that's cool. Yeah, man, I really appreciate your time and thank you for coming on. I guess if people want to get in touch with you or like try to get any funding for their projects or, I don't know, just ask you any questions. How can they get in touch with you?
00:28:47.006 - 00:29:21.982, Speaker B: Yeah, so honestly, pretty active on Twitter and I would recommend anyone who's watching this, who's not already in the Twitter space to just. To just get into it because it's probably the fastest way to just accumulate a bunch of knowledge on crypto and make a bunch of awesome connections. So, yeah, I would say best thing to do would just be add me on Twitter. My handle's just. I think I'm Justin Barlow links too. But yeah, essentially just reach out to me over DM and really just get involved, get into Twitter spaces, get into debates with prominent vc's on Twitter. Whatever it takes really to deepen your knowledge.
00:29:21.982 - 00:29:38.854, Speaker B: I think everyone in crypto Twitter has been super sort of, like, receptive to new people in the space. And so of course you'll have bad actors, but for the most part, I think the community is extremely supportive of people who are trying to learn and can really provide some really awesome resources to the space.
00:29:38.982 - 00:29:55.784, Speaker A: I totally agree. That's awesome. Yeah. I mean, on the Twitter thing, I think personally, I shied off Twitter for too long and now I'm trying to play catch up. Yeah, we'll definitely echo join Twitter and just start tweeting a bunch. It's where all the trip.
00:29:55.872 - 00:30:11.168, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. And come to hacker houses, come to in person events. It's always different seeing people in person and being able to connect and, you know, have a drink with someone who you never expected to have a drink with or, you know, just sit down and have a chat. I think, you know, you can learn so much just through, you know, having these sort of direct conversations with people.
00:30:11.224 - 00:30:13.592, Speaker A: So 1000%. The next one, right?
00:30:13.696 - 00:30:21.464, Speaker B: Next one, yes. Is in Miami. It's going to be a great time. So highly recommend anyone you can signing up for that Miami hacker house.
00:30:21.592 - 00:30:24.536, Speaker A: Nice. Awesome. Well, thanks again, man. I appreciate it.
00:30:24.568 - 00:30:25.760, Speaker B: Appreciate it, Mandy.
