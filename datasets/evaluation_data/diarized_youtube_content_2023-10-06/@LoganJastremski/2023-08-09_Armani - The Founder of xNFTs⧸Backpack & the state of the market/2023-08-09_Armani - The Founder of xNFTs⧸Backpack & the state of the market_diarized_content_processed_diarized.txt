00:00:26.190 - 00:00:33.850, Speaker A: Well, hello. Hello. We are now live. We are back. Episode three of the no Name podcast.
00:00:35.950 - 00:00:59.418, Speaker B: We really got to come up with a name, guys. It's three episodes already with some of the top people in crypto, and we don't even have a heaven name for the show. But, no, I'm super excited. Today we're joined by Armani Ferrante. He's a man that needs no introduction. He's one of these developers you'll only meet a few times in your lifetime. He can do things that most developers can't.
00:00:59.418 - 00:01:10.550, Speaker B: He's also one of those guys that understands the community side as well as the product side, which I think is very rare. And, yeah, without further ado, I'll pass it over to him.
00:01:11.410 - 00:01:13.870, Speaker C: Oh, boy. That's quite the introduction. How's it going, guys?
00:01:15.010 - 00:01:15.910, Speaker A: How are you?
00:01:16.450 - 00:01:20.160, Speaker C: Good, good. Am I supposed to be monologuing here?
00:01:21.420 - 00:01:25.440, Speaker D: I guess it's gn for you, right? The team recently moved.
00:01:26.780 - 00:01:31.160, Speaker C: It's 10:00 p.m. here. But, yeah, we did recently move. We're here in here in Japan.
00:01:32.180 - 00:01:34.200, Speaker D: Awesome. You have everyone out there.
00:01:34.500 - 00:01:59.396, Speaker C: Not everybody, but we have a substantive part of the team. Packed up our bags and moved over here. Kind of haven't been bouncing all around the world for the past couple months, and have finally, finally, finally settled down here in Tokyo. So super excited to be here. It's an amazing place. Honestly, if you've never been to Japan or Tokyo, I would highly recommend it. It's unlike anywhere else I've been.
00:01:59.396 - 00:02:03.840, Speaker C: Yeah, it's awesome. Finally have a home base and sit down and do some work.
00:02:05.340 - 00:02:14.322, Speaker D: Awesome. Yeah, I know the. I mean, obviously everyone knows you initially from. Well, initially before Xnft.
00:02:14.386 - 00:02:14.562, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:14.586 - 00:02:39.644, Speaker D: But Xnft and backpack kind of kicked off this recent trajectory that I feel like has really dominated a lot of crypto, Twitter, especially from the Solana side, for the last year or so. Most recently got the merch shipment out with the sweatshirts. There's been a lot of fun on projects for low quality apparel and merch in the past. I would say that this is the single best sweatshirt that I own.
00:02:39.772 - 00:02:45.960, Speaker A: This is Carhartt. This is super nice. I was. You guys handed this to me. I was like, wow, this is amazing.
00:02:47.060 - 00:02:48.244, Speaker D: Nailing the merch.
00:02:48.372 - 00:02:56.640, Speaker B: I have one of those hoodies, one of the original X NFT ones. It's like three sizes too big. I still wear it proudly. I love it.
00:02:57.740 - 00:03:02.764, Speaker D: Absolutely. Yeah. I feel like the natural place to start.
00:03:02.812 - 00:03:02.996, Speaker C: Right?
00:03:03.028 - 00:03:48.700, Speaker D: We can probably transition into XNFt and see really what's going on in the engine that is backpack. But mad lads have really been like a hit kind of everywhere, kind of has spanned across all of crypto, Twitter. I feel like sometimes things will get siloed into the Solana community, Ethereum, et cetera. But Madlad seemed to be one that has brought a lot of people together, Solana and Ethereum, working together to create a better, decentralized future. Something that I know all four of us believe in. Yeah, I would love to hear it. Almost seems like mad lads has been a very cool kind of go to market product for backpack, right? Getting people to come in and use the wallet.
00:03:48.700 - 00:04:34.790, Speaker D: And it seems like that's probably the best use case for nfts, right? Kind of bootstrapping an early community, having it as a go to market strategy for a larger product and a larger vision. And I think you guys have pulled that off to a tee. Yeah, we'd love to hear like, some of the initial thoughts around, like, kind of how mad lads was born out of the backpack team and then what some of the thoughts were just around, like, how it could affect go to market, like how the community building is important for a wallet, and then like the larger picture, which is XNfts. But yeah, if you get riff of it on the thought process behind matlads and. And kind of go from the initial stage to where we are now and what the community currently looks like.
00:04:35.930 - 00:05:43.476, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think there's a bunch of points to unpack. I think foundationally, and if you've heard my spaces or their podcast, you're probably sick of me saying this. But I think foundationally, crypto is this really incredible industry where you have the intersection of so many diverse fields, you know, whether it's, you know, scientists or engineers or artists or, or, you know, economists, you know, community builders, company builders, open source advocates, it's this really incredible mix of things. But fundamentally, I think it's really the intersection of tech and culture. And this is kind of seen by anybody that's been in crypto for any substantial period of time. You have these amazing communities that rally around these shared, I don't know, jointly owned assets, whether they're tokens or whether they're nfts or brands or protocols or pieces of open source software.
00:05:43.476 - 00:07:03.660, Speaker C: This is honestly the most magical part of crypto, and you see it in all the main ecosystems. Right? Bitcoin has this incredibly zealous and active community that you can't, you know, you can't get it to do anything against its will, you know, ethereum's got like, you know, I remember in 2017 when I first came into crypto, it was just like I felt like, I don't even know how to describe it. I felt like I went into another universe because, like, you know, I'd been living in San Francisco and was kind of working at Apple and was kind of in the normal kind of, I don't know how to describe it, I guess, corporate kind of tech culture, right? And Ethereum was like this really crazy. I don't know, it's just this, it really opened my eyes, I feel, in terms of, like, what was both, what was possible, but also, like, how other people were approaching, you know, open source and tech and things like that. You had this, like, kind of ragtag group of folks, you know, traveling around the world, going to conferences, giving talks, doing like, you know, ad hoc research groups, working on all this incredible open source that was like, basically anybody can join. And that was like a really magical thing. All these, like, really kind of, you know, nerdy developer types from all these different countries.
00:07:03.660 - 00:08:14.380, Speaker C: And, you know, on Solana, obviously, you know, as all pretty actively involved in, you've seen its own flavor of this type of community building. I would describe Solana as somebody said on Twitter today, actually, it's like a little less academic, it's a little more product centric. There's a lot of companies, a lot of people that are doing traditional kind of funding, but it certainly has its own culture that's distinct from the other two. And with mad lads, I mean, there's a bunch of motivating factors behind it. But this was maybe the foundational kind of, I don't know, view of the industry that crypto is built on tight knit cultures that create this magical and in some cases, unbreakable social layer that is kind of needed for all of the kind of subsequent technology that you might be building on top of it. And so with Madlad, it was kind of a multi kind of faceted approach. I guess there's, on the one hand, this view of the world.
00:08:14.380 - 00:09:14.590, Speaker C: On the other hand, we wanted to build products. And, well, in order to build products, you kind of have to know your customer, and what better way to know your customer than to kind of be it, right? And so if we wanted to build NFT products, we wanted to build a wallet. Mind you, this was probably the most important thing that was happening in crypto at the time. It was just like this huge Nft wave where NFTs had kind of penetrated the mainstream culture. You had Eminem and Snoop Dogg and all these crazy folks rocking bored apes. And it was really the first example, I think, beyond maybe dogecoin and bitcoin, of course, where it was a relatable product that normal people can get behind and understand and use. Because everybody loves art, everybody loves culture in crypto, NFts are kind of just the digital manifestation of all that.
00:09:14.590 - 00:09:55.514, Speaker C: We decided, well, you know, it makes a lot of sense for us to do an NFT project. And, you know, we took a look at a lot of the projects at the time and were, you know, studying them a bit and we thought, well, you know, all these folks can do it, we can probably do it. And we think, we thought we could do a pretty good job of it. I think there's certainly, like some, some creative bone and muscle kind of both in myself and on the team. You know, we love this type of stuff. And so, yeah, we kind of just thought it'd be a great idea. We can create this NFT community and help build the product kind of through it.
00:09:55.514 - 00:10:54.580, Speaker C: Right. Whether it's, you know, you saw some of the early features with XnFts, right? Random stuff that we were just trying out, like everything from like the XNFTs in the app store to messaging to building, like, social stuff to, you know, the entire mint experience, which, you know, if you went through the madlets mints, you know, there was a bunch of, everything from the whitelist to the mint itself was kind of like demonstrating some of these experiments and kind of stuff that we were just throwing against the wall. We had everything from games that we built for the whitelist experience. So we had like, you know, we had like, we were like one of the, I think one of the first crypto apps that were actually utilizing kind of like AI before, like the whole chat GPT bomb went off to like, you know, use dolly to guess prompts for, for images right there in backpack. And that's how you would get a whitelist. Or you would guess, like, AI gener or not AI generated, you'd guess animal noises. So you'd hear like shrieking, like, you know, pandas and crazy stuff like that.
00:10:54.580 - 00:11:43.076, Speaker C: And it turns out if you have like, you know, game that might seem trivial, plus discord channel, that was like a great combination, we found out because people just like to hang out with each other and do stuff, and it doesn't really matter what that stuff is, as long as they're maybe you solving some challenge or some problem together. In our case, it was animal noises and AI generated images. We had the minecraft puzzle hunt where we hit a bunch of invite codes inside of this huge cathedral and we did all this stuff. We did the less product stuff as well. We did content competitions and all that stuff on Twitter. It was really developing product through it and exercising our community building muscles. But it was a very long process.
00:11:43.076 - 00:12:12.530, Speaker C: It wasn't something we just like randomly did, like over a week and overnight, like, hey, we're gonna do an NFT project. We had that discord open for quite a long time, at least, at least six months, maybe longer. And eventually, you know, it culminated into, into the mint experience, which was like this huge thing. And, you know, I think maybe to, you know, close the loop on this, you know, the mint experience. We had this like, you know, xnft where, you know, you can, you, you got that. You, you minted a rug and. Oh, did I lose everyone?
00:12:13.230 - 00:12:17.262, Speaker A: No, you're so. I'm just playing around with different formats.
00:12:17.326 - 00:12:18.806, Speaker B: Trying to be fancy, but.
00:12:18.838 - 00:12:57.512, Speaker C: Got it, got it. Yeah, yeah. So, so, yeah, we had this experience where you minted a rug, you click on the rug, you enter into this like battle with the Mad Kingdom, and then it was kind of like a World of Warcraft raid boss inside of an xnft. And then once you do that, you find your rug and you unrug yourself to reveal the mad lad. Right. So it's like really this combination of like this creative storytelling and immersive experience, but all inside of the wallet and all using XnFts. And we really use it as an opportunity to showcase like some of our ideas and stuff that we are building.
00:12:57.512 - 00:13:35.600, Speaker C: Right. It was this whole like, storytelling process. And honestly, I feel like this is something that you don't see a lot of NFT projects do that they should be doing, which is, well, they should be using that. They shouldn't be using launchpads. I think launchpads, like, they're great businesses, maybe for the NFT marketplaces and not to like, you know, rag on the NFT marketplaces at all, but mints are the best opportunity to showcase what you've done and why people should care about you. It's the best opportunity for storytelling. And so if you're not taking full advantage of that as an NFT project, you are just leaving so much, you are leaving so much value on the table.
00:13:35.600 - 00:14:28.550, Speaker C: And anyway, we kind of went into that kind of neck deep and did that whole experience. And so mad lads was really kind of, on the one hand it was this community building exercise, but on the other hand, it was this product development exercise where we wanted to be our own customer. And that was like a great kind of, that was a great thing to do, I think. And it continues to be a great thing to do. And I think, like, the way I see it in the future, like, whenever we have these great experience or these great milestones, you know, originally it was the extension and x nfTs, but with each milestone, assuming you have enough demand, it's a great opportunity to showcase what you build. Do an NFT mint acquire users, get a new kind of batch of demand into the product and celebrate all of the hard work that you've done. And I think that's just a great way of doing things.
00:14:28.550 - 00:15:10.570, Speaker C: And I think we'll probably continue to do that in the future. But I think it's subject to demand and, you know, what the market looks like and whether people actually are interested in getting, buying the artwork and things like that. We obviously wouldn't do anything overly dilutive or anything like that, were very, very, very sensitive, especially after seeing, like, what a lot of other projects have done. So, yeah, I think that that was it. And then maybe there's this, like, third element to the thinking behind mad lads, which you're starting to see manifest right now, especially with things like the roster, which is, well, you know, you might have heard this quote a million times. I think that was like, Reid Hoffman or somebody said it. But, like, first time, you know, entrepreneurs focus on product, second time, entrepreneurs focus on distribution.
00:15:10.570 - 00:16:23.144, Speaker C: And so I think if you take that view of the world, right, and in crypto, distribution is really a fickle thing. There's not really that many teams with tons of demand and distribution. But it turns out if you have that, it's worth a ton, because crypto customers are just insanely valuable. And from this point of view, well, you could use NFT project or mad labs specifically as a distribution generating mechanism. And once you have that distribution, well, what you do with that is kind of up to you. And so what we've been doing is thinking, well, how do we build this brand, this decentralized brand, and make it, you know, as big as any other brand in the world? You know, if, like, you know, niking can do it or, you know, Louis Vuitton can do it or Red Bull can do it? Like, I don't know, we can do it, right? Like, because it's like kind of, you know, with crypto, you have this much more potent ability to get people to care about whatever it is that you want them to care about, whether it's a product or a coin or an NFT or whatever it is. And so what we're doing kind of with mad labs from this point of view is just building cool stuff for the sake of doing cool stuff.
00:16:23.144 - 00:16:44.672, Speaker C: And I think the roster is maybe the best example of this, where we are finding just incredible talent that we think has the ability to kind of, like, go big in their respective domain. So whether it's like professional surfers or, you know, snowboarders or, you know, talents like Jakey doing kind of, you know, other forms of content, how did that come about?
00:16:44.736 - 00:16:53.928, Speaker A: Because I've seen Jake do the content. I've seen you sign up surfer. You guys are going after some pretty cool people.
00:16:54.104 - 00:17:04.376, Speaker D: The Mad tattoo by Jakey in that video is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. Like, I saw that and I was like, mad lads is a different level, right? Like, no one has that going right now.
00:17:04.408 - 00:17:59.600, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think it took some, it took some time to get the team on board with this, but I think, like, I fundamentally think that TikTok and Instagram and all of these non crypto platforms are just so important for NFTs in particular and so underutilized. I mean, you're starting to see people kind of come around to this now. I think, you know, I think we were definitely one of the first teams that were just posting a lot, like, every Saturday, posting an image in the office, posting random videos, like, doing clips. And I think content is just, like, a great muscle to flex. And I think we're pretty new to it. We're definitely very new to it relative to, like, the rest of the world and the rest of web two. But I think we're decent at it relative to crypto, crypto companies.
00:17:59.600 - 00:18:33.306, Speaker C: And I just think it's super important. It's a great form of marketing. It's tons of fun, and it's a great way to get distribution, especially for, you know, for brands. And so for the roster, I think, you know, we're definitely lucky in that Tristan has a lot of, a lot of really great connections. He grew up in Hawaii. There's a lot of incredible talent out there. And so I think he's starting to tap into that as well, which I think also is pretty unique to us and our ability to find these types of folks and bring them in.
00:18:33.306 - 00:18:40.750, Speaker C: But there's definitely more where that's coming from. I'm super excited about it, and I think it's a unique direction to take the project in.
00:18:41.300 - 00:19:33.094, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the extreme surfers definitely fit the cultured brand that you guys are building too. Having that Hawaii connection to all the top guys. I want to go back to something that you hit on a few minutes ago around the mint. Being like the mint of your project is far and away probably the largest attention grab that most NFT projects have, or everyone focused on one thing at one time. You hit that resonance frequency where at that point everyone is bifid together. And to build on that, I remember Legend hosting that the mad lads Twitter spaces that I ended up joining, which was unbelievable, was like 10,000 plus people, I believe. Legend, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it was the single biggest space I've ever seen on crypto Twitter.
00:19:33.094 - 00:19:54.540, Speaker D: Solana related, outside of maybe bitcoin versus ethereum maxi debates. Yeah, I think grabbing that is something that a lot of projects really don't do and is incredibly important. So, like, you guys having the foresight to see that and then build in all the functionality to show off backpack. Such a smart, strategic play overall.
00:19:54.880 - 00:20:44.058, Speaker B: Yeah. And honestly, many people don't realize this, but some of the biggest projects in the space, including bored apes and punks minted under the radar, they were basically these random collections minted out. You know, punks couldn't even mint out like people the developers were minting to themselves, ten punks at a time, every few hours to check if the contract was working properly. And bored apes minted out not with a bang, but with a whimper. Like, they literally just kind of minted out. And then it was just social consensus, pure social consensus afterwards where people rallied around and said, look, these collections have provenance, or there's a particular set of conditions here that make this valuable and we're going to rally around it. And I think really mad lads captivated the attention in a way that was insane.
00:20:44.058 - 00:21:20.684, Speaker B: I mean, I was front and center. I did two, five or six hour Twitter spaces in a row the day of the supposed mint, where there was a giant amount of DDoS requests and then we had to delay. But I, you know, being at the epicenter of that, hosting those Twitter spaces, just feeling the energy was insane. That that was truly felt like a web two type of moment for me in terms of engagement, didn't feel like web3. That felt like, you know, I think of. I think of crypto Twitter as kind of like a planet, you know, like inside, you know, inside the atmosphere. We're doing these crazy things.
00:21:20.684 - 00:21:42.992, Speaker B: No, no one in the outside world really cares, so we're kind of just in our bubble. But that felt like one of those moments where we escaped orbit. And we were kind of like going into the unknown. Like, there was like blasting out of the atmosphere. And the engagement was like nonlinear, too. It was like, you know, 1000 people, then it was 2000, then it was 3000. And eventually I was gaining that.
00:21:42.992 - 00:22:24.750, Speaker B: The Twitter spaces was gaining, like hundreds of people per minute. It was just like the most insane, scalable, like, phenomena I've ever seen. And honestly, if we had kept running, it probably would have gotten to 20 or 30,000. It was absolutely insane. But I think Tarmani's point, too often people outsource things that are central to the experience, right? This is the first expression of what the team can do and the design and the philosophy and the intentionality behind a project. And giving that away to another platform feels like either you don't understand the magnitude of a mint and what it can do for your brand, or you just don't have a long term view and you're trying to minimize costs.
00:22:27.570 - 00:23:25.778, Speaker D: I would love Armani if you could give us some insight. I feel like to the average person who is maybe on crypto Twitter for an hour a day or something, not like us, but your general crypto Twitter enthusiast and jewelry, Solana is at a very interesting point where you have, like, a few die hards, right, who are like, obviously you have very smart teams that are building in the space. Solana. Like, a lot of attention is driven by token price, right? So, like, obviously Solana had a massive crash and has now bounced back. And I think your average person is probably looking at it as there are always these ecosystems that spin up in a bull market and they kind of die away. And there may be looking at Solana as, like, a coin flip, right? Of like, there's some really good stuff going on here. But, like, does Ethereum win this whole thing? And it's a flash in the pan? I don't know.
00:23:25.778 - 00:24:13.500, Speaker D: I think a lot of people that spend time to look into it, like Zion or Ansem, one classic example. He's just been bullposting Solana all day, but he's like, you have to do the deep dive and see what's going on here, right? There is a lot to be excited about, and especially in the near term future, but you have to be more plugged into the entire salon ecosystem than the vast, vast majority of people. So we love to just hear your take on kind of what's going on behind the scenes. Like, what are those nights of the roundtable meetings look like? Where all the top Solana guys are chatting with each other about the state of, say, the ecosystem, and just, like, heard. Yeah. Hearing your opinion on kind of where Solana sits at the moment would be pretty interesting.
00:24:15.800 - 00:25:15.890, Speaker C: It's funny to hear you put it in those terms. There's no, like, Solana Illuminati, where people are, like, sitting around and being like, all right, when should we, you know, do x, y, and z? It's funny because I feel like Solana attracts the type of person wherever. I mean, from my point of view, Solana and Ethereum are very different, not just at the social layer, but also just from a systems point of view, if you look at it from the perspective of an engineer. And so I think there's a lot of zero sum competition that you see on crypto Twitter. But from a design point of view, the two systems cannot end up in a more different place. If you think about, like, the universe of, like, all blockchain designs. Right? Like, Ethereum is, like, on one corner, and, like, Solana is on the other corner.
00:25:15.890 - 00:25:56.624, Speaker C: It's like. And so they're a lot more complimentary, I think, than people think. Most people aren't really looking at it from that point of view. They're just looking at it from the point of view of, like, oh, do I buy this coin or this coin? And that's where kind of, like, a lot of the kind of absurd kind of conversations come from. And so I think for the people that really need kind of the things that Solana is really good at, you know, high throughput, low latency, you know, parallel execution, Solana just, like, makes a lot of sense. Yeah, you should build that. Somebody should build it.
00:25:56.624 - 00:26:46.824, Speaker C: If it's not Solana, somebody else should build it. And somebody should also build a minimal data availability layer that runs on a raspberry PI and has a bunch of beefier systems with maybe bespoke runtimes on top that kind of talk and communicate through this settlement layer. Right? Both things should exist. And I think on Solana, it's funny because it's viewed as this contrarian thing, but it's really not that contrarian. Just if you put on your dev hat and you're like, okay, what do I need? And it's like, yeah, obviously you need this. It's like, yeah, obviously I want to write smart contracts in rust. Like, yeah, that sounds great.
00:26:46.824 - 00:27:05.872, Speaker C: Like, I've been waiting for a job where I can write rust, things like that. I've been waiting for somebody to turn up the hardware requirements. It's like, yeah, of course you should utilize bandwidth to the maximum kind of extreme. And like, yes, you should utilize all the cores on your machine. Like, duh. Like, every other system is built this way. Like, let's build it.
00:27:05.872 - 00:28:06.080, Speaker C: Let's build a blockchain this way and use it. Right? And so I think on Solana, a lot of, like, even through the crash, even when, like, FTX kind of went down and everybody was calling Solana a scam chain, that was like, you know, they're saying it's run by SPF or whatever, it's like, you know, the FTX chain or whatever, it's like, yeah, obviously that wasn't true. Right? So you just, like, look at the code, right? You can, like, see all the validators that are. That are kind of working together and you can see all the people that are building. So I feel like a lot of that stuff is really easy to ignore if you're just in it. And I think the same thing was true for Ethereum in 2019. Granted, I felt like Ethereum in 2019 was actually more painful of a bear market from my point of view, because it wasn't really specific to Ethereum.
00:28:06.080 - 00:29:08.966, Speaker C: I felt like in 2019, it wasn't obvious to me that much of the industry would even exist. And maybe that's just because I was relatively young and green and stuff, but it felt very different versus the whole FTX crash was like, okay, this is a devastating event, obviously a horrible, horrible thing. But it didn't feel like the industry was going away. It felt like the industry was, had reached a point of no return. It felt like Solana maybe was at a crucible moment where one of two things was going to happen to Solana at that point in time. It would either collapse under the impression all the devs would leave and the people would sell their tokens and stop, exit and go back to Facebook or go to another blockchain or whatever. It would forge its soul and transcend into a tier of blockchains that basically only two other projects can lay claim to.
00:29:08.966 - 00:30:04.078, Speaker C: Right? Bitcoin and ethereum. That's it. And, yeah, I feel like the latter basically happened right, where Solana has basically become this unkillable force in the blockchain kind of wars, so to speak. And so I feel like that's kind of more or less kind of how I viewed that whole situation. I think it was very. I think the reason why I was able to get through that moment was, I mean, it had a great social layer, but it's really rooted in sound engineering. I feel like basically what it comes down to, it's the same reason why people love Ethereum, right? It's like they know that there's been a lot of thought behind the design space and the trade offs that those guys have made, and they're doing it all in public and they're doing it right.
00:30:04.078 - 00:30:29.770, Speaker C: And I feel like a lot of people have that same confidence in the Solana engineering, not only because of, like, the work Solana labs has done, but also because of the work that, you know, for example, jump and the fire dancer team is doing. Like, that's incredible stuff. Like, if you want to talk about giga chads, those guys are probably the biggest gigachads in all of the entire industry. Honestly, you look at that code and it's kind of gnarly.
00:30:30.750 - 00:31:27.990, Speaker D: I think two points on that. I would be remiss if we didn't shout out our newest show sponsor on this way, with parallel execution doing, et cetera. You can go dive into the Twitter if you want to learn more about it. Second, I think fire Dancer is something that, again, your average crypto tweeter enjoyer has probably seen, because the very smart people who create a lot of the cool things that are being built on Solana talk about, but generally don't understand really anything about what's going on with firedancer. And there hasn't been, there hasn't been kind of that like, 280 character breakdown that, like, lets everyone kind of understand. I think I saw someone tweet yesterday, they were like, why didn't you name this upgrade or something? Solana 2.0 jumping on the Ethereum side? And then someone replied, well, I'm pretty sure fire dancer, we should just name Solana 2.0.
00:31:27.990 - 00:31:58.160, Speaker D: So I think it's getting a lot of hype. If you could simplify a bit of what fired answer or even just talk about what it enables if you don't want to dive into what's actually being built on the tech side. But just like, what say, firedance here was completed and implemented. What does that look like from the user standpoint? And then from the builder, any of the main overview characteristics would be awesome to run through.
00:32:00.860 - 00:32:32.280, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny. It's no coincidence that Monad, your sponsor, the founder Keone, is from jump as well. Monad seems like a pretty awesome project also doing the things that like, yeah, somebody should be doing that stuff. People should. I don't know exactly how they're building. And I think it does, like, optimistic pipelined transaction execution. And so I think that's like a good example of like, kind of blockchain architecture.
00:32:32.280 - 00:33:14.342, Speaker C: This makes a lot of sense. I'm really happy that he's working on it. But the TLDR for fired answer is, how do I, how do you, how do we say this in a way that makes sense to people? I mean, the TLDr is that it will mo. Most people that write software do it very inefficiently. Fired answer will be very, very efficient. A simple example of this, just to put it in and put numbers on it. If you take a look at the rust, the rust crate for ED 25519 signature verification.
00:33:14.342 - 00:33:55.752, Speaker C: This is the elliptic curve that Solana and other blockchains use to sign transactions. It's like how they do the asymmetric cryptography. And Rust is like a pretty fast programming language. It's like probably, you know, it's, you do a lot of high performance stuff, but you basically can get 30,000 transaction or signature verifications per second, per core. That's the number that you get with Rust out of the box. What the fire dancer team said is like, well, that's too slow. That's way too slow.
00:33:55.752 - 00:34:51.626, Speaker C: So what they did was they rewrote that crate, but they did it on FPGA's. For those that don't know, FPGA is basically programmable hardware. It's like a programming language. It's like a little DSL where you can write circuits, things like Verilog, et cetera, and you can run that code on a FPGA, which is basically programmable hardware. Bypass all of the complexity and inefficiencies of using operating systems and general purpose cpu's and just really optimize down at the circuit level with your custom programmable hardware. They rewrote this on FPGA's. Instead of getting 30,000 transactions per second per core, they get a million, several orders of magnitude increases.
00:34:51.626 - 00:35:26.060, Speaker C: So it's not some insane scientific breakthrough. I think a lot of folks think about blockchains from these research perspectives. It's really just, well, we have really good tech. Let's just optimize it to the extreme. You have the world's, arguably the world's best high performance computing engineers tackling the blockchain problem. That's basically what it comes down to. And it's not just Ed 25,519 signature verification.
00:35:26.060 - 00:36:04.850, Speaker C: It's also things like just the general how they just utilize the machine. The entire architecture of fire dancer is rewritten from scratch. To be able to properly utilize the term is like mechanical sympathy, I suppose, like the memory hierarchy of your machine. It's like people that know how computers work rewrite the software. So it basically comes down to just optimizing the hell out of the validator client and make the blockchain go fast. That's kind of it.
00:36:05.220 - 00:36:55.750, Speaker B: I think what's most amazing, honestly, is also the fact that there's going to be a second validator client that's able to help decentralize the network. Because Ethereum is the only other chain with more than one. I think they have four or five at this point. But something that's plagued Solana has been reliability and uptime or downtime issue. So really having the second validator client will be massive from the jump, but then those performance upgrades are going to be insane. I was looking at the presentation, and I think this is a level of performance that is borders on web two already, but you're bringing all the magic of composability and smart contracts and interoperability and all these things in as well. So it's honestly insane.
00:36:55.750 - 00:37:55.860, Speaker B: And I think throughout tech, there's these big transition moments, like a step function where you go from dial up to broadband and broadband to fiber optic. And every time you make one of those jumps, engineers can build way cooler things, right? Like, you couldn't build YouTube on dial up, you couldn't do low latency gaming or high fidelity streaming and 4k on broadband, right? And I think the sandbox gets bigger every time there's a jump. And engineers, I'm only just like, it boggles my mind what people are going to build. Once one of these blockchains can do like 2300,000 true gps, what kind of applications can you build with that? And I think no one really knows, but it's incredibly exciting. And it reminds me almost what you're saying Armani about. There's a video game in the 1990s called Rollercoaster Tycoon. I don't know if you ever played it.
00:37:55.980 - 00:37:56.852, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:37:56.956 - 00:38:03.320, Speaker B: The guy written in assembly, he wrote it in assembly, and I thought that was super cool and kind of like related to what you're talking about.
00:38:04.660 - 00:39:11.572, Speaker D: To build on your point legend, there's. There's this book called Metaverse by Matthew Ball, a term that has kind of fallen out of the popular vernacular recently, in my opinion, probably comes back in. But one of the main things that he talks about is people not really understanding what is actually enabling these things to be built. An idea comes up in 2008 or something for an Internet company, and someone's like, how did no one think of this before? And his entire argument is, it's not that no one thought of it before. It wasn't possible before. You need all of these hardware upgrades and you need the piping to be much, much stronger to support these types of things. And the main point that he makes in metaverse is basically you can't have 1000 people all in close combat in one map of a game with a lot of high graphics, not because no one can imagine it being built, but because the hardware isn't there to support it.
00:39:11.572 - 00:39:37.570, Speaker D: And one of the main cases he makes is that you follow Moore's law. Hardware gets much better. Eventually that will be enabled and then the apps will be killing that come from it, which I think is like a pretty, like, I think of salon in a very similar way. Right. Fire dancer. I'd like abstract all of the actual tech background away from the user side. Can I get 1000 people on the map? You're going to be able to do a lot more things with crypto that resemble that.
00:39:37.570 - 00:40:11.354, Speaker D: If you think about like 2017 ethereum, like people buying cryptokitties and like gas is like crazy high, that was the most that we could do. The tech was maxed out. But as you add efficiencies to the overall system, then the apps that you can create. I think of stepn as I guess not rip. I don't want to hate on Stepn, but kind of rip, but that was a massive wave. And the reason that it hadn't been built before was because it couldn't have been built before. And Solon enabled that.
00:40:11.354 - 00:40:49.752, Speaker D: I think we're going to see a lot more apps that follow similar trajectory. I think gaming is something that, or at least low latency. A lot of transactions going back and forth. Gaming was not possible, but you can see the vision of how it makes sense. It's just waiting until the actual tech can support it and then you need the distribution. As you said earlier, Armani V two with high distribution on gaming should be cool. But yeah, yeah, I think that's like most people don't realize that the hardware enabling is like the main variable in a lot of these apps being built out.
00:40:49.896 - 00:41:13.910, Speaker B: It's massive. And honestly, I had a question for Armani around. There's kind of this age old debate on, I guess, in Silicon Valley or tech, wherever. Basically a lot of people argue infrastructure comes first and then products, other people argue products and applications kind of like set the, set the path and then the infrastructure catches up. What's your take on that?
00:41:15.330 - 00:42:13.230, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great question. I think. I think it depends. I think in the case of the Internet. I suppose I was going to make the argument that you have salient examples of both cases, but even the case of the Internet was driven by pretty concrete examples, peer review articles and sharing that stuff. I think for most people, it's the product that drives the infrastructure. I think because a lot of these ambitious infrastructure projects need a lot of time and a lot of money and motivated, motivating use cases to properly design them.
00:42:13.230 - 00:43:23.240, Speaker C: I think great examples of this are a lot of the modern database systems that came out of Google and Amazon. Like a lot of those systems, if you go and read those research papers, like bigtable, for example, bigtable, DynamoDB, these things, some of the first elastic NoSQL database systems that allowed you to get to web scale. Before that was a thing, basically we had this transactional postgres MySQL type databases with very strong kind of what are known as acid semantics in the database world. And then you had these huge companies that came out of the early days of the Internet that really pushed the boundaries of what their databases can do. And so they were kind of required to reimagine a lot of this stuff. And if you go and read the research paper, it explicitly says, I forget which one I think was. I think it was probably bigtable that like, this paper was not like a first principled thing.
00:43:23.240 - 00:44:02.152, Speaker C: It came out of existing code and infrastructure that Google had built to support the search engine. And I thought that was a very interesting thing to read and something that has very much informed my view of this conversation. In the case of Amazon, they built the bookstore first. It wasn't like, I'm going to build AWS first. They built the bookstore first. And then in order to build the bookstore and get to that scale, they had to build all the infrastructure for AWS. Then they realized, well, if it's useful for us, it's probably useful for other people as well.
00:44:02.152 - 00:44:15.390, Speaker C: So let's generalize it and provide it as a business, and the rest is kind of history. And I think those are two pretty darn good salient examples. I think. Oh yeah, go for it.
00:44:16.050 - 00:44:58.960, Speaker D: I was just going to add one example that's more it hasn't played out yet, but we're seeing it play out real time. I think meta like for better or worse, they see the AR and VR space as if the tech can enable it. There is an insane amount of product market Fitzhen and kind of like human to tech interface changes that will like fundamentally shift society. They're like, I know that it's going this way it can't be built yet, right? Like currently we have these massive headsets and like, they stink. The UX is terrible. Once you put it on, it's pretty good. And like Zuck, but hate them or love them.
00:44:58.960 - 00:46:00.334, Speaker D: He was explaining like their path to trying to get to like their end state product. And he talks about how like, you basically want, you want to build from two sides and have them come and converge, right? And one side is taking the hardware that people want to wear, right? So the glasses and seeing how much you can enable from that side and then taking like the massive headset with the full experience and trying to shrink down the hardware there. And basically you work at it from both sides. And eventually, you know, hopefully two, three years from now, you get to a point where the hardware is exactly what you need. So I think it's like both things working in tandem. We know that this will have a mass amount of product market fit and hopefully be like very important and potentially the next big kind of user tech upgrade that exists. So they have that goal in mind and think that it'll be very important and then they're building out the infrastructure to get there, right, because it doesn't exist yet.
00:46:00.334 - 00:46:24.130, Speaker D: So I don't know. Excited to see how that plays out in real time. Like, I'm pretty bullish on it in general. I don't want to push my bias too hard, but I think that that's a really good example of infrastructure and kind of the drives of what people actually want to buy. Like, true product market fit, working in tandem to get to a point where the tech enables the user experience.
00:46:24.820 - 00:47:09.320, Speaker B: I would love to have an open source headset where I could interact with x nfts. Like, think about tokenized applications airdropped into your headset. For me, that seems like such a no brainer. I was chatting, actually, with a guy who works closely with Nvidia. He actually has product keys and API keys that most people don't have personal friends with. Jensen, but he was telling me that the biggest thing is the glasses need to be small and comfortable. And then like, the module that actually powers them in terms of compute needs to be like, upgradable and it needs to probably sit on your, like on your hip or something.
00:47:09.320 - 00:47:57.512, Speaker B: It can't be like tethered to the wall or else you can just use a PC. So, yeah, he was actually going through a lot of those like, design questions and debates that you're talking about, Kevin. But I think also it's just a question of time, right? The compute is not there where I think you need eight k at 130 frames for it to be lifelike. We just haven't got there yet in terms of compute, and it hasn't been condensed into the glasses format yet. But the beauty of this kind of what you were talking about, Armani, is that like, you know, bandwidth is doubling every two years, or the cost is having or whatever. And compute with multicore performance is also doubling every x number of years. It's not a question of if we get there, it's when.
00:47:57.512 - 00:48:03.900, Speaker B: And I think that's what's most interesting for me, looking at the space. But I had a question around.
00:48:06.760 - 00:48:07.384, Speaker C: App.
00:48:07.512 - 00:48:56.404, Speaker B: And product design philosophy. I know you spent some time in Apple, and Apple, of course, is famous for building a lot of stuff themselves. They didn't outsource the calendar app, they didn't outsource the calculator app or iMessage. They just said, look, let's build it ourselves and let's have a very robust and cohesive experience where we control everything. And once we have that rock solid foundation, then we can open this up as a multi sided platform with iOS. And I think that business model is extremely proven. I mean, just the other day, Apple took their market value, surpassed, like the 300 largest companies in the UK, which is like their s and P 500, which is insane to just think about that one company is basically larger than the entire UK stock market.
00:48:56.404 - 00:49:19.150, Speaker B: But having worked there and then looking at crypto apps like Stepn that had a very self enclosed system, they had a Dexde, they had a marketplace, they had a wallet, they had an onramp, they had, like, all these different things. How do you feel about crypto apps building very isolated niche experiences versus self enclosed super apps?
00:49:21.570 - 00:49:59.326, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a really good question. I think it's this weird catch 22, because especially venture funded startups want to grow as big as humanly possible. And so they start the niche. They grow, they, you know, they win that niche and then they're like, all right, how do I keep growing? Right? And they just keep doing this over and over and over again, right? So with Stepn, they're like, okay, well, I'm. They built this walking app or whatever. They're like, great. We have the walking app.
00:49:59.326 - 00:50:44.040, Speaker C: We have a token, we have the nfTs. Why are we using somebody else's Dex? Let's just make our own Dex. And so they take over the Dex, then they become like, number one Dex overnight or whatever, and then they keep having this conversation. But the problem with this and crypto is that crypto is so network driven. And so if you kill off one of the, you know, members of the network, right, then there might not be a network anymore, right. It's like you can imagine if, like, magic Eden wanted to like, create a Dex or something, right? It's like they started competing with like Phoenix or whatever, and they did like, you know, that might look a little strange, right? It might not make any sense for like, the salon ecosystem. You might have a less vibrant eco.
00:50:44.040 - 00:51:51.290, Speaker C: And so it's this weird kind of catch 22. And I think it depends on what you're building. I think this mostly applies to protocols and smart contracts, where I think ultimately the most sustainable things in crypto are things with the largest incentivized group of people that are using them. So in the case of smart contracts, like a Dexe, not just about building a great app, although that's a super important part, but it's also about getting other people to care about it. And so that's why tokens are so interesting, this kind of shared ownership over a given piece of open source software, where in theory, the people that contribute value to that network are getting paid out proportionally pro rata to the value that they're contributing. And if you have that mechanism, then you have a sustainable value creating system. Now, in practice, you don't see this really happen much at all.
00:51:51.290 - 00:52:36.920, Speaker C: You could argue happens in l one s. But l one's probably the best examples of it. But it's hard to do tokenomics and it's hard to create mining systems. And usually there's some issue with the way it's designed, whether it's too large of a vc allocation or a bug in the software, or just you got a hyper parameter wrong and that creates some weird incentive that you couldn't have foreseen. So I think maybe to circle back to the question, it just. I guess, at least right now, I don't think we've seen any good examples other than centralized exchanges be able to like, dominate an entire kind of. I mean, I actually would argue centralized exchanges don't do this either.
00:52:36.920 - 00:53:25.394, Speaker C: Centralized exchanges very much stay in their. They stay in their lane, so to speak, right? They're kind of like venturing into the wallet space and things like that. But that just makes sense, right? They're not like, I guess Coinbase is doing like base, and that is maybe a little. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out. Maybe might not be great from a decentralization point of view, which is probably like maybe a super important consideration that might not be communicated much at all. Which is to say that if it's not decentralized, then there's. What's the point? That's not to say exchanges should be decentralized, but base.
00:53:25.394 - 00:53:43.330, Speaker C: Certainly. Well, l two. Certainly. L1, certainly. And so there it is, this kind of question where you want to grow, but maybe you don't want to grow too much and hurt that kind of argument, but, yeah, I don't know. That's my long winded ramble.
00:53:45.230 - 00:54:28.504, Speaker B: Yeah. No, it's insane. Like your level of thought with this stuff down to the hardware and computer level. When we ask you a question about product or applications you like, you go extremely deep. And I think it's very clear to folks, even the non technical people looking from the outside, that the level of thought that goes into each of these decisions for you is very much looking at the entire stack and drawing from your knowledge as a coder. And these considerations are extremely nuanced. Even just talking about the exchange business, it's extremely interesting to see how things are playing out.
00:54:28.504 - 00:55:06.840, Speaker B: I think some degree of like backwards or forwards vertical integration makes a ton of sense for these chains and for these exchanges with their kind of L2s. But it's all just experimentation. There's no set in stone best way of doing things. People are just trying different stuff and seeing what sticks. What's pretty clear is that the crypto user is extremely valuable per capita. It's the most valuable user in the world by far. I mean, you have companies with 10 billion plus valuation and a few hundred thousand monthly active users, which has never happened in the history of tech before.
00:55:06.840 - 00:55:53.660, Speaker B: And I think people are just waking up to this and there hasn't even been a gold rush of data and analytics either, which is really when you remember back to web two. This is what kick started a lot of like, the bull run for tech is when people could do data and analytics and look at, hey, I spend this amount, and this is a quantifiable benefit that I get for marketing on Google or for running ads on YouTube or whatever. And when they could quantify that impact, that's when the advertising exploded on the Internet. Right. And to this day, a lot of the money made on the Internet is from advertisements. Unbelievably, like, we haven't changed that much. But I think, yeah, without, without rambling too much, it's an incredibly exciting time.
00:55:53.660 - 00:56:10.990, Speaker B: And I think, and just in speaking with the Armani, what really comes through is like, your level of like, the depth of thought is insane compared to, you know, I talked to a lot of other founders. They are not nearly as nuanced and as kind of like full send in these answers as you.
00:56:17.170 - 00:57:44.956, Speaker C: One thing that came to my mind as you were speaking, that was maybe going back to the previous topic, just to go a little deeper. Upon reflection, perhaps the most exciting thing about Bass, and perhaps the correct thing about Bass is that you have this incredible, incredibly capitalized behemoth and coinbase that is investing into its ecosystem and its industry by Kevin, where theyre now no longer sitting on the sidelines and just operating in exchange, theyre also just investing manpower and resources into the decentralized world and the more crypto native part of things. And I think that's a really cool thing to see. And so I really love it from that point of view where, well, how can you argue with their millions of users, right, that just, that's great for the industry. And if they're going to throw in like, you know, millions of dollars investing engineering resources into these l two s, I think that's, that's a, that's a win for sure. And so I think that's like another maybe salient point that's worth pointing out and honestly a credit to coinbase for having the foresight and desire to invest into the industry rather than just, they can just sit on their hands and just be a profitable exchange and do nothing. But I think it's pretty cool to see them do this as well.
00:57:44.956 - 00:57:47.640, Speaker C: So anyway, sorry for rambling.
00:57:48.140 - 00:58:02.320, Speaker A: Legend and I are going to the Stanford blockchain conference and I'm going to be sitting down with one of the kind of like core technical leads of base and do like a deep dive of their technical stack. So super excited for that.
00:58:03.700 - 00:58:06.480, Speaker C: Yeah, that'll be exciting. I'd be curious to listen to that.
00:58:07.260 - 00:58:08.160, Speaker A: Me too.
00:58:09.260 - 00:59:14.630, Speaker B: We're honestly surprised sometimes. Logan and I wouldn't say which bank, but we talked to major us bank or someone who worked there and ran payments, and they basically told us there's a division of like tens of thousands of people at this particular institution that are doing payments and settlement for banking. And that with the right blockchain, a permissioned blockchain, most likely they can reduce headcount by tens of thousands of people. And I don't want to sound insensitive, I think it's just like a natural progression of things. But it is quite insane to think some of the largest companies where we know, Amazon, Google, others are building their own blockchains. And I think once one of them does this and people see the unlock and what it can do for just internally, even this is going to be something that's going to be very, very commonplace. And I think that day hasn't come yet, but very quickly.
00:59:14.630 - 01:00:07.120, Speaker B: I mean, even governments and others will be adopting these things. So it's an incredibly exciting time. But just wanted to pivot to back to backpack and Matlad's to close this one out. I think, you know, a lot of people look at what you guys have been able to accomplish in such a short amount of time. It's only been not even five months. It feels like a year or two years that you guys have been shipping so much and made so much waves on social media. But kind of what, what, you know, for folks that are holding their mad lads and using backpack every day, what, what can you guys kind of share or what, what kind of philosophy is guiding the next six to twelve months for backpack? You guys have arguably conquered the NFT space in a major way.
01:00:07.120 - 01:00:20.620, Speaker B: You did more volume than bored apes and punks for weeks on end. You've built a tier one wallet that's amazing to use. It has fantastic, like, innovations. Kind of what's next.
01:00:22.720 - 01:00:56.390, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm going to give. I'll give an appropriate answer, but it'll be an incomplete answer for reasons that all three of us understand. So I think there's a couple components to the way that we're thinking about the next kind of three months. So, very tangibly, we've moved to Asia, we moved to Japan. I've been bouncing around Asia for the past couple months. It's a very exciting section of the crypto industry. I think we very much have, especially in the Solana world, have had very western focus.
01:00:56.390 - 01:01:37.732, Speaker C: And so I'm excited to just honestly get more exposure to folks on this side of the world. It's a very different culture, but there's a lot of incredible people and a lot of stuff to share and a lot of stuff to learn from people. So just generally excited about being here in Asia. The second thing is, I think, on the mad lad side, just branding and distribution in non crypto ways, I think I'm very, very excited about that. We don't know where it's going to end up, but I think it's going to be a fun experiment. If nothing else. We'll have a bunch of cool, cool videos with really incredible people, cool athletes, cool artists.
01:01:37.732 - 01:02:36.156, Speaker C: We've got a couple really just insanely talented people that I'm super excited to share with the world. I think over the next couple months, and then I guess the third thing is keeping in mind where we are in the cycle where at the depths of the bear, and I was talking about this on the stream this week, I really just view right now is the time to hunker down and focus on taking moonshots, investing in big things, because there's not much going on in the industry right now. There's no reason to rush things out to market. There's no reason to do a bunch of hype and marketing. There's no reason to even invest in short term projects. Right now is the time, I mean, I think it was Mark, Mark and Tristan, the time to build, right? But that's so true right now. Right now.
01:02:36.156 - 01:03:33.010, Speaker C: Now is the time to focus on multi year long projects. Now is the time to like, you know, to get to go big, basically. And the analogy that I like to give, or that I gave over the weekend was during COVID I don't know if you noticed, but during COVID a lot of very smart companies or buildings basically did this. I'm thinking of a school close by where I live, and I noticed it's a school that's been there for just my entire life, basically. But in Covid, they tore down the entire school, gone to rebuild it because everybody was working from home, nobody was going into school. So they took that opportunity to upgrade the entire school, basically. And that's basically, I think, how I'm thinking about things right now.
01:03:33.010 - 01:03:59.790, Speaker C: It's, let's not optimize for the next week or the next month or next quarter. Let's really optimize for the next year or even longer than that, because that's when things will start picking up. And so we're very much investing in a lot of really hard work. A little quieter than one might expect, but I think it's for good reason and hopefully it makes sense.
01:04:01.570 - 01:04:54.730, Speaker A: I think the long term thinking generally wins than the short term mindset. And unfortunately, in crypto, with the crazy bull markets and terrible bear markets, it's easy to get caught up in the short term. And so, as always, it's, I think, just super refreshing to hear from you, Armani, and just how long term you actually think about these things. I think that is the type of leadership and vision that's really going to pull us out of these bear markets and really building products. Not for the couple millions that are really on chain today, but the hundreds of millions and billions of people that will ultimately interact with crypto and all the unique promises that I think us three on this stage believe the crypto markets will ultimately enable. It's just now taking that to the masses.
01:04:57.030 - 01:05:39.430, Speaker B: Yeah. I think one last thing that reminded me of was yesterday. Buffalo from GDO Labs said, you know, a lot of people are taking like, nerd snipes at each other in the bear market. But he said, don't forget to ship too. So I think a lot of people are forgetting. They always ask me, they're always dming me. I have a secondary inbox of probably like 20 people asking me, when is the bear market going to end? And I always answer, when someone builds something that is so new and so exciting that we onboard a bunch of people and people start buying crypto again and they start using this application and it honestly is that simple.
01:05:39.430 - 01:06:19.914, Speaker B: Like right now, clever folks like yourselves are building things that I think have the potential to ignite a new bull run. And it's really as simple as that. I think you phrased it beautifully. It's kind of like a low opportunity cost, low risk environment to really hunker down and just build something amazing. And we're incredibly excited. I know the mad lads are going nuts, and I think everyone in the community is super on board with that long term vision of yours, which is really rare for a collection that's only been out for a few months. Normally it takes two years of, like, trials and tribulations to get to this point.
01:06:19.914 - 01:06:59.454, Speaker B: But I think if mad lads have done one thing extraordinarily well, it's to really weed out the short term thinkers in the group. And everyone that I talk to, they're. They're full believers in your vision, Armani. And they're full believers in the backpack team as well, which is just excellent. So, yeah, with that, I mean, this has been an amazing episode. We've hit on Mad lads, we've hit on marketing, we've hit on the roster, and we've gone into tech, we've talked to product applications, infrastructure, blockchain, scalability networks. We've talked on a lot of different topics.
01:06:59.454 - 01:07:07.330, Speaker B: I think it's going to be an amazing episode, but just wanted to thank you for coming on and also to thank our sponsor, Monad, for helping put this together.
01:07:08.270 - 01:07:09.486, Speaker A: Thanks, Armani.
01:07:09.678 - 01:07:10.350, Speaker C: Thanks so much, guys.
