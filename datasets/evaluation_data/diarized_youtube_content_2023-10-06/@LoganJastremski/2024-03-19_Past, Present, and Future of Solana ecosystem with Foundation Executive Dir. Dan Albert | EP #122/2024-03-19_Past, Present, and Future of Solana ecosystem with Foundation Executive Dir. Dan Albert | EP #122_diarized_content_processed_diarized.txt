00:00:00.240 - 00:01:17.506, Speaker A: The conviction of the people who stuck with us is so high because they are making this existential bet that says, hey, Solana is a platform where it's the only platform on earth where I can build the kind of product that I want to build. And, you know, this is what I believe in, and I will walk through fire to get there. And that is a high bar of conviction. To think of someone saying that and what we were left with through kind of all the trials of 23 and all the doubters and all the fud and all the stuff going on in the market and the governments was like, everyone who was left necessarily had that view, because anyone who was just like, shit, I'm out of here, they left. And so we have this, like, battle hardened, forged in fire community of people who stuck with us. And now that attention is coming back, the market is coming back, we're seeing all these new products and projects launch. We have this really dedicated cohort of people who are like, we were here when it's hard, we're going to be here when it's good, and the latest hype trend isn't going to change our conviction on this technology.
00:01:17.506 - 00:01:26.410, Speaker A: That is something I am eternally grateful for. That is basically who we built the network for. That's who I work for at the end of the day.
00:01:29.750 - 00:01:38.734, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, Dan, thank you so much for hosting me. Glad we're together in Denver at the Ethereum conference, but thank you so much. Really looking forward to this.
00:01:38.822 - 00:01:40.694, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great to have you here.
00:01:40.782 - 00:02:08.084, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. So maybe just to start off, I think you play a very vital role within the Solana ecosystem, but I feel like you're a little behind the scenes sometimes, whether you choose to or not. And I would love for kind of the audience to really learn a little bit more about you, kind of the history of Solana. And so maybe if we could just start from the beginning, how did you get involved in Solana foundation? How'd this all come to be?
00:02:08.252 - 00:02:27.690, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. So let's see. Yeah, it's been an interesting journey. So today it's 2024. I'm serving as executive director for the Solana foundation. But I guess the Solana story, and at least my portion of it, started way back in 2018.
00:02:27.690 - 00:03:02.024, Speaker A: I worked at Qualcomm with one of the original Solana founders. Most of the technical founders and most of the early core Solana developers were actually all former Qualcomm engineers. And we were working on a couple projects together, and it was 2018, and he took me out to lunch one day, and he says, hey, I've got an idea for you. I've got this friend, his name's Anatoly. He's a really smart guy. He wrote this white paper. We're trying this crypto thing, and we're just hiring a couple people to see if we can get this off the ground.
00:03:02.024 - 00:03:45.430, Speaker A: So do you want a job? That was 2018. I actually put him off for a little while, had some other personal stuff going on. And early 2019, I joined, as, I think, employee number ten in Solana Labs. So this was pre mainnet. This was actually pre Testnet, even at the time. Testnet was a couple of scripts used to spin up, like, ten GCP nodes and run some super alpha software on there. And, yeah, it was really just anatoly, the other founders, me, and four, five, maybe six other engineers, and that was all of Solana at the time.
00:03:46.330 - 00:04:05.450, Speaker B: It's pretty crazy just to me, like, how kind of these origin stores really become and then how hard they actually scale, like, over time. And it's really hard, I think, for the mind to kind of fathom when you first start that journey to even where we are today, to where we are going to go. It's massive.
00:04:05.610 - 00:04:20.784, Speaker A: Yeah, it really is. I mean, and it's in. It's happened in such a short time frame. I mean, it feels like an eternity in crypto, right? Five whole years. Boy, how we've aged. But, yeah. And just sort of seeing the trajectory of growth.
00:04:20.784 - 00:05:18.294, Speaker A: I mean, there's so many projects now that I can't even keep up with the latest and greatest in the ecosystem. And it's honestly kind of overwhelming sometimes. And it's so inspiring to see the only way that this project and this community are really going to continue to scale and continue to grow and continue to push the boundaries is through a huge multitude of community leaders and thought leaders and researchers and builders coming from all over the place, not necessarily needing to talk to or know anyone at the Salon foundation or talk to Anatoly or whatever. We still try to stay engaged and helpful in the ecosystem. But I see our primary mandate here is just remove blockers for other people, get things out of their way and get out of their way and let them build, let them create. And that's, I think, where we're really, really seeing some incredible acceleration right now.
00:05:18.382 - 00:05:42.758, Speaker B: 100%. I think the space has its very high highs and low lows. Maybe kind of fast forwarding a little bit to the past year, to 2023. Can you kind of talk about kind of the ups and downs like Solana went through as the entire industry. But I think Solana even more how that kind of affected the team or the network, so to speak.
00:05:42.934 - 00:07:01.410, Speaker A: Yeah, 2023 was a difficult year. You know, in sort of the wake of the FTX blow up and all of the chain reactions that came before and after that, I think it really, unfortunately, like, it shook a lot of people's confidence. And those who were sort of here for the flash and those who were here for the real kind of purpose of this technology were very quickly filtered out. And that's not to say it was easy by any stretch, for those of us who stuck around. And I think one of the kind of unique and awesome things that we've seen in Solana, and this was true even in 2021, when Solana kind of first came onto the scene and then sort of reproved itself again. I think in 2023 and now today in 24, is like the conviction of the people who stuck with us is so high because they are making this existential bet that says, hey, Solana is a platform where it's the only platform on earth where I can build the kind of product that I want to build. And, you know, this is what I believe in, and I will walk through fire to get there.
00:07:01.410 - 00:07:56.786, Speaker A: And that is a high bar of conviction. To think of someone saying that and what we were left with through kind of all the trials of 23 and all the doubters and all the fud and all the stuff going on in the market and the governments was like, everyone who was left necessarily had that view, because anyone who was just like, oh, shit, I'm out of here, they left. And so we have this, like, battle hardened, you know, forged in fire community of people who stuck with us. And now that attention is coming back, the market is coming back. We're seeing all these new products and projects launch. We have this really dedicated cohort of people who are like, we were here when it's hard, we're going to be here when it's good. And the latest hype trend isn't going to change our conviction on this technology.
00:07:56.786 - 00:08:19.530, Speaker A: That is something I am eternally grateful for. That is basically who we built the network for. That's who I work for at the end of the day. And, yeah, like what? You know, we built this awesome network. It's got, it's this blockchain. It's got incredible features that we can talk about until we're blue in the face, but it's not useful if no one uses it.
00:08:19.910 - 00:09:17.420, Speaker B: And I think just kind of riffing off that point. I got involved in crypto in 2017 and kind of got a little jaded throughout that process because I felt like blockchains became unusable, like, they got expensive, they were confusing, they were complex. And to me, the more that I personally dove into Solana, the Solana architecture, and then used the blockchain, I was just very impressed by the simplicity. And I, as kind of a former product person, I want people to use the product because at the end of the day, if it's just a token or coin and number go up, sure, that's fun for a little bit, but what purpose does that actually serve to the world? And I've loved that. Solana. Now, even today, in 2024, people are using Solana because it's simplistic, it doesn't have as much complexity, and people will try it and they're like, wow, this is amazing.
00:09:17.540 - 00:09:45.672, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really. I think it's really in a class of its own. And it's unfortunately, I think, been hard for some doubters to wrap their head around that. Is this really. Is this even possible on a decentralized blockchain based on what we've seen in the past? And it's like, I want people to be open minded. Crypto as a whole changes all the time. It's incredibly disruptive technology.
00:09:45.672 - 00:10:47.346, Speaker A: And to assume that the game is over, the game is won by any project, whether it's ETH, whether it's Solana, whether it's something else that hasn't even come around yet. No one should have so much hubris as to think we have solved all the problems, and someone isn't going to figure out a way to do something better or faster without actually compromising on the principles that crypto is founded on. And as a product, this was sort of what we designed Solana for. This is what we designed Solana around, is, can we create, you know, a truly decentralized system that is truly fast, is really cheap, and synchronizes data all over the world as fast as physics allow. As you know, we say blockchain at the speed of light. It's not actually a meme. That is the limitation of the blockchain is the speed of light through fiber optic cable is 200 million.
00:10:47.346 - 00:11:47.052, Speaker A: Earth has a circumference of 40,000 km, which means the theoretical fastest you can send data around the planet is 200 milliseconds in a perfectly straight line with no latency and real world effects. Right. But that is the sort of physical limitation that Solana was designed for. So the continuous transaction streaming, the parallel processing in the runtime, the continuous block forwarding and block shred forwarding and fast consensus were designed so that data moves to all nodes in the network continuously through fiber. That wraps the whole world. And with the goal being that you can have state on a blockchain, such as a pricing market update to every node on earth as fast as data travels through the Internet. When news happens in London and someone finds out about it in New York a few milliseconds later, and someone else finds out about it in Singapore 100 milliseconds later, the only latency there is how fast light travels through fiber.
00:11:47.052 - 00:11:54.916, Speaker A: And this is the design principle that we built Solana around to have this uniform global state machine.
00:11:55.108 - 00:12:24.790, Speaker B: There's a bunch of ways we can take that. I love the vision, and I still think more broadly, the market and general crypto participants do not fully understand this. We could kind of take it down the decentralization route of having high throughput and high decentralization. We could go down parallelization or kind of like the all to all communication. Is there any particular things that you feel like we should touch on at least first?
00:12:26.610 - 00:13:14.872, Speaker A: I think what's most important, I think maybe not most important, but what is really important for people is just use it. Just try the chain. There are some incredible products out there, um, drip, tensor, jupiter, um, you know, there's a bunch of stuff happening in deep end where you can, like, earn money for doing, you know, physical work. Helium, you can run a hotspot hivemapper, you can, you know, get a dash cam and earn tokens for driving that you were going to drive anyway. So there's a lot of really cool products. Infrastructure is useless unless people use it for something that they care about. And I think that is under emphasized in the space, because crypto, rightly and wrongly, has attracted some of the most brilliant minds in tech and the most brilliant minds in finance.
00:13:14.872 - 00:13:36.488, Speaker A: And we dive into incredibly interesting and esoteric technical problems without a lot of thought for, okay, but who's going to really use this thing that I've written a lot of academic papers on? And we can have a lot of philosophical debates, and these are important, but at the end of the day, products will drive the innovation cycle.
00:13:36.584 - 00:14:11.458, Speaker B: I was talking with a bunch of people here in eat Denver, and I kind of was tired and a little bit frustrated with some of the conversations that I was having. And I tweeted right before bed that I was going to restake my l two into my l three and then bridge from arbitrum and then post it on Celestia. And to me, it's all intellectually interesting. I love it. Personally, I really like to nerd out on, like, the technical details. But to your point, it's like, okay, this is all infrastructure. Where's the products? And I think that's what has been very refreshing to me.
00:14:11.458 - 00:14:32.222, Speaker B: I know some Solana is relatively complicated from a technical standpoint, but I also think it's relatively dumb or simplistic in terms of you add more bandwidth and you add more compute. And I love that because it makes engineers and the product builders life's much easier because they know that they can get continued scale over time.
00:14:32.326 - 00:15:23.460, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I think if you look at Solana compared to, I'll say, any singular piece of, say, the ethereum scaling stack. Right. And the dev experience, you say, oh, it's much more complex. It has all these unique requirements and how we build smart contracts and transactions. But if you look at it at the whole, which is all you need to do is built on Solana and not also this bridge and also this l two. To get the kind of experience you want, you realize the path to just simply thinking about what is the product that I want to build? What do I want to bring into the world that I'm excited about, that users are going to want to use that adds value to their life? Just focus on that. And then there's one layer, and there's all sorts of developer tools and resources and API and infrastructure services companies to help you get there.
00:15:23.980 - 00:15:59.300, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's. I'm very much appreciative of the engineers that allow the infrastructure engineers that allow application engineers to focus on applications, because application engineers should not have to learn the infrastructure to build a good product. And I think, unfortunately, the world that we are in today with crypto, a lot of application engineers just want to build applications, but they're forced to make a lot of difficult decisions, and where do I build? And I love the simplicity of just kind of one single global C machine.
00:15:59.380 - 00:16:47.646, Speaker A: Right. I mean, it's sort of, you know, there's been this, you know, comparison. You know, Solana is sort of like the taking the Apple model or the iOS model, right? Everything's integrated. The runtime was built in tandem with the networking protocols on purpose because they both were optimized for fast data propagation, parallel transaction processing. And it's sort of like saying, okay, well, anyone who ever wanted to develop an app for iPhone needs to learn all the intricacies of the iOS operating system stack and say, no that's ridiculous. You learn typescript or C sharp and you download the Apple SDK or the iOS SDK and you go nuts. You build the product that you want to build on, and there's this beautiful platform ready for you.
00:16:47.646 - 00:17:02.312, Speaker A: With all so many users on this rich market of distribution and basically auto marketing on the App Store, for all of its challenges, it still brings a lot of app developers to a lot of people.
00:17:02.456 - 00:17:27.942, Speaker B: Yeah, it's understated the importance of just allowing engineers to focus on what they should be focused on, which is products maybe shifting slightly. How do you kind of view Solana in today's world? We're coming into March of 2024. How are you feeling about the network? What are you excited about for the future?
00:17:28.046 - 00:18:37.018, Speaker A: Yeah, if I can actually go back just a moment and then I'll answer that in the vein of letting application engineers just build applications and trying to foster a culture within Solana that that encourages that. We actually just a couple days ago announced our newest hackathon. It's called Renaissance. It's being run by a new organization that actually spun out of the foundation called Colosseum. And the whole focus is not just here's some docs whip up a couple hundred lines of code. It's how quickly can you go from idea and collaboration with other people building to a pre seed fundable product? And so all the hackathon winners are getting funneled to accelerator programs, getting immediate intros to potential vc's for pre seed funding, because we don't want to just say, okay, yeah, people built stuff. It's like people wrote code and got product ideas and now have the structure and motivation and incentive to continue building real products in Solana.
00:18:37.204 - 00:18:55.130, Speaker B: So I think Solana has actually been world class and like the leader by far in terms of the hackathon that they put on thus far. I know Coliseum is ultimately doing incubator or being able to seed some of these companies. Is Renaissance different from Colosseum?
00:18:56.110 - 00:18:59.366, Speaker A: Renaissance is the name of the hackathon event that Colosseum is running.
00:18:59.438 - 00:19:00.810, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, cool.
00:19:01.830 - 00:19:26.936, Speaker A: We've always had, like, fun and different names for each of the slot of hackathons. I think the tagline this time, if you saw their tweet thread, they did AI mods on all this classic Renaissance art. And it's like, can you help bring Solana into the next golden age? As we have this renaissance of growth and users and products and renewed interest across the market, that it's just super.
00:19:26.968 - 00:19:39.300, Speaker B: Important to capitalize on that 100% for maybe some of the more Silicon Valley minded people. Is it more a Y combinator model, or would you akin it to anything else that exists currently?
00:19:42.240 - 00:20:13.260, Speaker A: I guess probably similar to a Y combinator in the sense that the top of the funnel is quite different because it's this open global hackathon. It starts on March 4, runs for six weeks. There's a bunch of different prize tracks. There's millions of pre seed funding available, etcetera. And we've got developer resources from the Solana foundation. There's third party resources. People can just get started, jump in the discord.
00:20:13.260 - 00:20:45.070, Speaker A: Even if you're like, I've never written a line of Solana code in my life, or maybe I'm a business person or a product. You're a UX person, not a developer. Get in here. We desperately need a lot of skill sets that are not just people who can sling code all day. And so there's this sort of, like, community flywheel that gets bootstrapped every time we have a hackathon. Regardless of whether these projects win or not, they get this kind of camaraderie. Hey, I tried something, I learned something.
00:20:45.070 - 00:21:23.680, Speaker A: And so there's this kind of broad benefit to the community that I think doesn't exist in like a traditional kind of Y combinator or web two style hackathon or accelerator. And then at the conclusion of the hackathon, I believe the model that Colosseum is taking is we have judges from across the ecosystem. It's not just two guys at Colosseum picking who they want. A lot of these winners can then get, as they reach mid funnel, in their way to success, intros to VC's and potential mentorship, you know, incubation and acceleration.
00:21:24.220 - 00:22:10.672, Speaker B: Yeah, it is beautiful. I truly think one of the things that was core to kind of that Solana being forged through the fire was some of these in person events, the hackathons that Solana did, but also the online hackathons, because I think we all spend so much time just speaking on Twitter or X, and to be able to connect with people either at foundation, at Coliseum, or various VC's, speak with them, have a conversation, get some feedback that is really invaluable. And it's something that I think the Solana community has done uniquely well outside of other ecosystems, is just fostering that community side of things.
00:22:10.776 - 00:22:42.580, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, yeah, definitely agree with you there. We'd be nowhere without our builders. We'd certainly be nowhere without our community. The Salon foundation. We've hosted a bunch of in person events over the last couple of years. And what's been really exciting this year, 2024 in particular, is we're seeing the growth and scale of community driven events are really outpacing and outstripping the things that foundation is specifically producing, which I think is amazing.
00:22:42.580 - 00:23:31.324, Speaker A: There was all this hype. So the whole month of February, Washington, I think the fifth iteration of Mountain Dao, which is this month long builder house that's from day one, been organized by a bunch of hardcore builders in the Solana community. They rent a house or a co working space in Salt Lake City and ski all day and code all night, and it's an awesome event. And what I observed to my whole team at the foundation was like a year or two ago, the model was like, hey, Solana Foundation's going to do an event. We're going to do a hacker house, or we're going to sponsor some booth at something and like, hey, community, come and maybe do a side event. Because Solana foundation maybe brings the critical mass this year. Mountain dad has always been community run.
00:23:31.324 - 00:24:28.796, Speaker A: We went to them and I was like, mountain Dab brought the critical mass. And I was like, hey, guys, can me and some of my Solana foundation team show up and hang out with all the cool kids? And honestly, like, that's fucking awesome. It's always been like, the vision, as I've sort of expressed to the team, the goal is, over time, for the foundation to become less important. And why is that important that we do that is for the community to flourish, they need to be able to be unblocked and kind of bootstrap themselves. And so we just try to remove as many obstacles as possible, make it easier to build on chain support, particular initiatives, but are generally hands off the direction that the ecosystem chooses to innovate. And we're seeing the same thing.
00:24:28.828 - 00:24:29.220, Speaker B: True.
00:24:29.300 - 00:25:07.274, Speaker A: At the community level, there's mountain Dow Island Dao looks like it's being put together on some warm island somewhere. This summer, I think. Exact location TBD. Solana Crossroads is happening in Istanbul in May. That's a community run event. The founders villa, run by super team in Dubai, just wrapped up a month of helping a cohort of Solana founders bootstrap new companies in the UAE. There's a bunch of in person builder meetups supporting the Renaissance hackathon that I've been seeing pop up all over the world.
00:25:07.274 - 00:25:27.250, Speaker A: Teams are like, hey, Renaissance is an online hackathon. It's a global hackathon. But let's get together in person with our local community and kick ideas around and that kind of growth is just. It's just really inspiring and really humbling to see people just coming in from every country and just being like, hell, yeah, we want to build on Solana.
00:25:27.370 - 00:25:31.070, Speaker B: From a basement to worldwide. It has to be a little humbling.
00:25:31.530 - 00:26:12.620, Speaker A: It is. It's incredibly humbling. Yeah. And I think I was telling you earlier the actual origin of the network we built, like me and a couple of the early engineers, by hand, the first validators that we used to launch Solana Mainnet in the founder's basement just a handful of miles from here in the summer of 2019. I got a corporate credit card and a Newegg account and just ordered all this hardware, shipped it to his house. We slapped it together, and we actually racked it in a data center here in Denver. And they're still running with those bright green leds.
00:26:12.620 - 00:26:23.836, Speaker A: That was the original Solana color, was just black and glowing green. So I made sure to deck out all this. We've got this whole server rack in a data center that's just black machines glowing green.
00:26:23.948 - 00:27:14.610, Speaker B: That's amazing. No, I think, yeah, the Solana community has really been forged by fire. And I think what's now, and we've kind of, like, talked about this, is that it's easy to use that community is kind of welcoming. It's not overly complex to just try out Solana and use Jupiter or any of these other applications drip on the network, use a deep end protocol. And I think the more people just experiment with this and get to on chain, the larger and larger that community becomes. To your point, perhaps a foundation becomes more irrelevant over time, as the community is really the one in the driver's seat.
00:27:14.690 - 00:27:34.850, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I sort of have this mantra within the foundation, which is give away our wins. Right? We're not here to make the Solana foundation big and important. We're here to make, you know, help make Solana big and important. And Solana is out there. Solana is all of you guys.
00:27:34.850 - 00:28:08.102, Speaker A: And we just want to keep as many people kind of unblocked as possible, because if I can, if I can remove a block from one person, I may have removed a block from 100 people or a thousand people who want to come later, you know? So I want to see, like, community growth, you know, like, just total parabolic up and to the right and, you know, head count influence. A lot of things at foundation are basically, like, level, if not slowly decreasing. You know, I think a lot of people have this belief that, you know, maybe sonic foundation is a lot bigger, or does actually a lot more than we.
00:28:08.166 - 00:28:09.982, Speaker B: You guys have always stayed pretty lean.
00:28:10.126 - 00:28:52.160, Speaker A: Yeah, the whole foundation team today, I think, is about 70 full time, full time folks. And that includes, we've got a dev rel team, we've got a marketing team. We still do events. So we've got an awesome events team who helps put on our hacker houses and produces breakpoint, a bunch of technical folks that help work with the validator community and advocate for validator best practices and integration. Best practices producing developer content. We are, you know, we do a lot of grants for developer tools, for public goods, for, you know, first of its kind, reference implementations. As people use new tech like token extensions.
00:28:52.160 - 00:29:11.968, Speaker A: Some academic level research is something we're more interested in funding these days. But all of this stuff ultimately, like, the real work is happening outside. Right. I want to seed as many outside brains as possible with, you know, ideas of what we can do with Solana. How can we make Solana better? That's really the goal.
00:29:12.064 - 00:29:42.448, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe shifting slightly to some of the more either technical aspect or just things that you're excited about on the community level for 2024, fire dancer is obviously one big thing. I think there's now been different client implementations ultimately spinning from labs. Can you talk either about either of those or just what you're excited about as the community continues to grow over time?
00:29:42.584 - 00:30:44.570, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, the sort of direction and maturity of the protocol process, if you will, like, the actual pushing core changes to the validator network. That whole process, and the community of folks that are participating in it, has really grown and changed a lot in the last year, and we're definitely going through, I'll say, some growing pains as we figure out some processes and some better mature process, I guess. But, yeah, what the landscape looks like right now is the protocol team. The validator team from Solana Labs spun out. They formed a new company called Anza, Anza Technology, and they are forking the Solana Labs validator, which to date, has been, like, the core primary validator for the Solana network. They're forking that off, and I think they announced they're renaming it to agave.
00:30:44.570 - 00:31:32.306, Speaker A: And so they're going to continue maintaining the agave validator going forward. And we've also got Jitto on the network. Jitto is another fork of the Solana Labs validator. They're optimized for mev and something like 50% of the stake on Solana. Mainnet today runs Gedo, so we've already got diversity of brainpower that's really powering the network and contributing things. Important to note that Jitto is, it's like 99% the same code, and they just made some modifications in how they do block packing and scheduling to power their mev solution stack. But there's two more projects coming down the line that I'm really excited about.
00:31:32.306 - 00:32:34.330, Speaker A: The first one is fire dancer. We've been talking about this for a while. I am confident that the firedancer team, I think, is the most high powered, high talent engineering team in all of crypto. The kind of work and optimizations and improvements that these guys are working on, that they propose and argue adamantly with Anatoly and the other engineers about, is just mind blowing. And they're building a new validator for Solana from scratch, written in c, which is different from the labs validator, and Jito, which are written in rust. And in addition to being, like, a super top notch engineering team, they're from a team at jump trading, which is a big financial firm, but they're ultimately a technology firm. They have this great benefit of being the first team to rebuild this.
00:32:34.330 - 00:33:16.740, Speaker A: And so all of the battle scars in the Solana Labs validator code base because we had to build the plane as we were flying, and you're touching production code every time Solana Labs wants to make a change or fix a bug, you're like, okay, fix the code, but don't break the network. Firedancer has this great benefit of, like, they don't need to worry about that. They can be like, this is how it should be. We can re architecture things. It's still all the same protocol. And what they're showing in some of these early tests is like, ten x to 100 x performance improvements in some parts of the stack on the same Solana protocol, on the same hardware that validators are running on mainnet today.
00:33:17.150 - 00:33:40.294, Speaker B: It's pretty impressive. I mean, the fact that it's the same hardware and not even increased validators specs. I mean, just watching Kevin Bowers at the last two Solana breakpoints give his talks were rather remarkable on how they're talking about how light propagates through a chip. I don't know if you can go much deeper than that, right?
00:33:40.382 - 00:34:06.184, Speaker A: You really can't. I mean, you know, there's this funny. There's like, I have these two quotes from, you know, Anatoly, right, the godfather of Solana, and, you know, Kevin Bowers, who's the head of fire dancer team, right? Anatoly's line for forever was like, you know, blockchain at the speed of light. And Kevin Bowers comes in, and he has a whole lecture that is called the speed of light is too slow. Like. Like, that's kind of the level of brain power that they're pointing at, this. And you're right.
00:34:06.232 - 00:34:06.392, Speaker B: You.
00:34:06.416 - 00:34:58.240, Speaker A: You simply can't get faster than physics. And the original implementation that Solana labs built optimized for physics. Light through fiber, continuous streaming. And then data travels across the Internet as fast as it does. Fired answer is improving a lot of the algorithms and protocols on the data propagation. But they're also looking at how fast does data travel within the chip? What physical wiring route does data take when it hits the NIC, the network cardinal from the incoming fiber line and gets to the cpu? And how far does it travel to this core, to that core, and to memory? And are you reading and writing from memory? More times than necessary. Adding latency within your system like this is the level of optimization that they're getting.
00:34:58.240 - 00:35:13.446, Speaker A: He even has a map of worst case distance for light to travel or data to travel across ten centimeter wide chip. And how can we optimize for these paths?
00:35:13.558 - 00:35:42.942, Speaker B: I think the thing that always drew me to Solana, just being at Tesla previously, was think from first principles and question assumptions. And physics is the only true bottleneck. And then hearing Anatolia in the community speak about just how physics was the actual limitation, it really kind of spoke to me as, okay, if you can really push the hardware and write the software in such a way that physics is the only limitation, I don't know how you really get that much better than physics.
00:35:43.046 - 00:36:27.750, Speaker A: Right? I mean, physics is the limitation for data propagation and parallelism. Number of cores is the limit for basically parallel processing, or how many transactions can you pump through a node in a given cycle or a given moment or block time? And so this is basically what we optimize for, right? It's data propagation as fast as possible through fiber and scalable parallelism. So, the Solana runtime, the SVM, is multi threaded. It runs, I think, currently by default, on four cores on the validator node. There's no reason that that can't scale up. Eight cores, 16 cores, whatever Moore's law still holds, there will always be more transistors on a chip.
00:36:27.830 - 00:36:42.402, Speaker B: Can you talk about that just a little bit more? Because there's a lot of debate within Silicon Valley or the tech world, as Moore's law dying. How do you add more compute capacity to chips? If you should just dive a little bit deeper into that, be great.
00:36:42.506 - 00:37:44.142, Speaker A: Sure. And I'm not an expert in transistor fab. But I think the curve hasn't been broken. We're coming up on some physical limits of basically, how many atoms wide can you make a transistor? I think what's sort of a little underexplored is what happens when we start doing 3d stacking of transistors. You can make them only so much smaller on a 2d wafer. But what happens when you do vertical stacking within a single silicon chip or have hyper fast multi chip architecture? So, like, I'm not quite sure what the. You know, what the answer is, but, like, as long as intel and TSMC and Samsung and, you know, like, the big chip fabs in the world, as long as they continue to compete and continue to exist, and, you know, intel and AMD and Nvidia.
00:37:44.142 - 00:38:18.928, Speaker A: Right, like, the chips will always get faster, whether it is because of Moore's law or because they figured out how to put more chips on a card or any other innovation. Like, I think what's almost more important than Moore's law is basically capitalism. Competition. Intel and AMD compete with one another, which means they'll always have faster chips every year, regardless of how they do it. And so Solana is basically able to scale with number of cores, number of threads that you can put on a single node. However, it's whatever the particulars of its construction might be.
00:38:19.024 - 00:39:05.288, Speaker B: Yeah. The other thing that maybe, I think we should kind of go a bit further on is just the alt all, like, data sync. In my podcast with Anatoly, I really tried to have him explain it in depth, because I still. I don't feel like it's fully understood by most. And to me, it's one of really the Solana like, secret sauce. I think you kind of mentioned, like, the news event in Japan going to New York or Dubai to New York, and that all to all communication is really, I think, something special that I think, over time, builders will kind of figure out how to better utilize that and something, I think, more broadly, the market just does not appreciate at all.
00:39:05.384 - 00:39:46.056, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So the idea here, sort of one of the things we say, it's not a blockchain, it's a global state machine. And so what the heck does that mean? The idea is that Solana can synchronize state, which is the balance in your account, all the data of the current state of the blockchain to anywhere and from anywhere on the globe as fast as data can get there, which is the whole speed of light thing. We were talking about every node on the Solana network of which there are currently 3300 nodes in 40 countries on six continents.
00:39:46.168 - 00:39:47.420, Speaker B: Very decentralized.
00:39:48.280 - 00:41:12.064, Speaker A: Every single node on the network synchronizes global state, and they do so continuously. Currently it's on the order of 1 second, sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less. Depends on some software bottlenecks that we're continuously working through to make the implementation faster. But yeah, so if, sorry, let me see how I want to describe this. If you have like a piece of information that should be, that you want to make public that's newsworthy, that is a piece of news or a market movement, a price of some asset somewhere in the world, that shouldn't just be limited to the traders who pay whatever they pay, a million dollars a year for a Bloomberg terminal, that data, that price, that market is available to everybody at the same time. So there's no sort of added layers or complexity or, settle down here, come up here on the DA layer, every node synchronizes the global state continuously. That's really the simplest way to say it.
00:41:12.232 - 00:42:01.466, Speaker B: Anatoly kind of explained it as everybody gets the exact same kind of cable length as you would hook up to New York or the Nasdaq, where you're getting the same information pretty much at the same time as everybody else, and there's no unfair advantage. Everybody, really, anybody can add a full node to the network and give them that equal and fair access to that data synchronization. And this is something that fundamentally l two s kind of, you can kind of do it within an app chain, but just depends on how large the apps chain gets. But I think the real Alpha with Solana is just specifically being designed for that alt all and having a large quorum or large number of nodes, wherever anybody can really add a node and receive that information.
00:42:01.618 - 00:42:39.760, Speaker A: Right. There's a lot of data that people are pushing right now, particularly defi markets, and with the data providing solutions like pith and switchboard, that it's really important that it gets everywhere at the same time. Everyone gets equal access. Like you said, anyone can run a full node. And yeah, it's sort of this like great sort of democratizing force of access to information, and more importantly, the ability to act on that information. Everybody gets the same ability to read from the blockchain. Everyone has the same ability to write to the blockchain.
00:42:39.760 - 00:43:10.990, Speaker A: And so this sort of leveling the playing field of access to read, but also access to write and transact and capitalize on value, whether it's financial value or, you know, some expressed opinion through a dow vote or a political thing. Like, everybody can engage at the same platform. And because of how this scales, because it's so fast, you don't have to worry that, you know, just because someone's doing an NFT mint, I'm not going to be able to do my, you know, my defi swaps.
00:43:11.070 - 00:43:53.220, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, in financial markets, people paydevelop large sums of money to make sure that they have that real time data access. Because if you're trading or have some livelihood, making sure you get that most up to date information is really pertinent. And so it's very cool. I think one of the other things that kind of gets me excited is just like that Nasdaq on a blockchain, kind of having these heterogeneous kind of order books, so to speak, like Japan, London, all be collapsed into a single state machine. It's a beautiful vision, and I think one that I've been thinking more about.
00:43:54.200 - 00:44:33.060, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the. The unchained order book is something that is really uniquely only possible on Solana, because you need to be able to, you know, see the price moving, get your bids in. You know, like, if you look at any order book, like, 90% of all the orders are cancels. People open a position, they close. A position, they open, they close. And this only works when you can submit transactions super fast and super cheap. And the cost of canceling 99 out of 100 orders that you pay in transaction fees needs to be less than the financial opportunity of trying to close that trade, even if it's only a couple points.
00:44:33.060 - 00:45:21.166, Speaker A: That real time market really can only happen on Solana. And as we're seeing now with more people interested in RWAS, and there's renewed interest in tokenized securities, and we might see tokenized stocks or bonds or real estate loans you're starting to bring. These are not speculative assets. These are real productive assets that have a market price. And a lot more people can have the ability to access these markets and access these assets in a fair way without taking on, I'll say, some of the speculative risk of assets that might be endogenous or native to the crypto ecosystem.
00:45:21.278 - 00:45:54.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. There's a lot of things that I think people don't appreciate about Solana. And I think the exciting thing now is the infrastructure, the additional clients that are coming online, they now, I think I can see, like, a very clear path to this vision or this world where you kind of have this synchronized order book. And something that I am very excited about. It's been a long road.
00:45:54.840 - 00:46:13.192, Speaker A: It has, it's been a long road. And it also has been a short road. I think we have a lot of short term memory in crypto. Right. Solana Mainnet was launched in March of 2020. Right. It's less than four years old, and look at where we've come.
00:46:13.192 - 00:46:28.528, Speaker A: And like, that gives me like, so much inspiration and excitement for like, what's going to happen in another four years. You know, how many more things, like where is the state of the ecosystem gonna be? People are gonna be doing things we can't, we haven't even thought of.
00:46:28.624 - 00:46:45.356, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm here for it maybe shifting slightly. I think one exciting thing that labs recently announced was token extensions. Can you touch a little bit upon token extensions and what gets you excited about that more broadly?
00:46:45.388 - 00:47:00.716, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So token extensions is actually something that has been sort of in the works for almost two years now. It was originally known as Token 2022. We sort of renamed.
00:47:00.748 - 00:47:03.532, Speaker B: Rebranded engineers are great at naming things.
00:47:03.596 - 00:47:33.986, Speaker A: Yeah, they're great at naming things. Yeah. It was a good name in 2022 when they started the repo, and then we launched in 2024, but that's all good. So what, token extensions are a new token standard for Solana. And what does this mean? So currently there's basically one token standard on Solana. There's a single token program. Often people refer to it as SPL token or token keg, and it's a single smart contract.
00:47:33.986 - 00:48:23.776, Speaker A: It's been audited 100 times. And every token on Solana, with the exception of Sol, the native token, is minted through this SPL token program. I say this because there's actually a distinction here from how ETH and ERC 20 tokens work, which I think is an important distinction to make, because it really ties into what flexibility token extensions provided. On ETH, you have the ERC 20 standard, which says if you want to launch a token, here's how the interfaces should look. And you write your smart contract, you write your token to have whatever special behavior you want, while it's just know what the ERC 20 interface looks like. And that sometimes introduces smart contract risk. You get a new token, but you don't actually know.
00:48:23.776 - 00:48:57.198, Speaker A: Or maybe some users are nothing, you know, informed enough to know how to safely, you know, receive some of this. They don't know what these tokens may or may not be doing on Solana. The, this is true of all programs. Smart contracts are separated from their accounts. So we say like, programs on Solana are stateless. So the token program does not have any tokens in it, it just has executable code. And then there's lots of other accounts on chain that belong to users that contain tokens and data about what the token mint address was, what the token balance is.
00:48:57.198 - 00:49:33.486, Speaker A: And so people can mint tokens and users can receive tokens knowing that they all came from the same program. And I'm not taking any iterative smart contract risk. And all these tokens invoke the same token transfer instructions and rules and safety guardrails. So that's in general how tokens and programs work. On Solana with token extensions. There's a new token program that we call token 22. It supports all of the existing features of legacy tokens of SPL tokens.
00:49:33.486 - 00:50:52.012, Speaker A: And the most important thing is it enables various, what we call extensions are basically optional configuration flags that a token issuer can set on their token at the time of mint that enable all sorts of unique properties and behaviors in a single smart contract in a single mint. So you don't need to add additional smart contracts or added complexity. So for example, there's an extension called transfer hooks, which basically says, any time that a holder of my token that has a transfer hook, anytime they transfer a token, invoke some other logic, right? Whatever it is, run some extra program. Anytime the blockchain detects that I hold this meme coin that has a transfer hook and I send it to you, something else happens. In addition to that, there is an extension for transfer fees. So it says, hey, anytime that I transfer to you this token with a transfer fee, 5% or ten bits goes back to the issuer or goes back to some fixed address. So this can be used for things like permanent royalty enforcement on secondary markets.
00:50:52.012 - 00:51:44.516, Speaker A: If someone uses this for nfts, there is an extension called permanent delegate authority, which we desperately need a new name for. I think basically what it means is the issuer of the token has ultimate authority to revoke the token from your wallet. So obviously you wouldn't want this with like permissionless tokens like Sol or USDC. But what this could be used for are things like subscriptions, right time expiring subscriptions, KYC tokens that, you know, hey, you need to renew your KYC once a year. You do that, you do the thing, you know, you get a token and 365 days later it's automatically removed from your wallet. And in the meantime, the platform that does the token gating check has assurance. Okay, well I know it's got a transfer hook or a delegated authority.
00:51:44.516 - 00:51:48.400, Speaker A: So as long as you've got this token. I know your authorization is good.
00:51:48.780 - 00:52:41.476, Speaker B: Yeah, it was very funny. I recently did a podcast with Nick White, one of the co founders of Celestia, and we were kind of talking about kind of more modular roadmap versus the integrated roadmap. We were talking about high level token extensions. And in my point of view, how kind of the more integrated blockchains, the high throughput blockchains are becoming more customizable over time. With things like token extensions, you can do private token transfers as well as many of the things that you mentioned, the token hooks, and ultimately giving developers more and more flexibility to build the applications that you want. And so to me, it's kind of funny because you have the kind of modular roadmap that's crowding all these customizations, but then you're also having kind of the integrated blockchains that are having more customizations, more flexibility for engineers to build applications they want over time.
00:52:41.508 - 00:52:51.760, Speaker A: Right. Like how many front end engineers or typescript devs want to build their own private Internet?
00:52:52.300 - 00:52:58.572, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think we're very much in like the intranet versus the Internet phase in blockchains.
00:52:58.676 - 00:53:52.406, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if you go back 20 or 30 years to businesses that were first adopting the Internet, they'd build their own server rooms, they'd run their own cable or phone lines between corporate offices and go through huge overhead just so that you could have a company intranet. We don't do that today. Right. I mean, sure, you still have it and you have your server rooms, but like, it's all SaaS, right? It's cloud. You can have virtual private cloud in three clicks on AWS. And you can have a lot of the same benefits of like what they were trying to build with sort of corporate intranet. And I think there is like a mind shift that has definitely been happening, and I want to kind of see it continue of people like, are a little bit trapped in this.
00:53:52.406 - 00:54:06.170, Speaker A: I have to build my own infrastructure in order to build my own app kind of mindset and come play on Solana. It's all here for you. Just come with a product idea and build your app.
00:54:06.470 - 00:54:28.114, Speaker B: I think to that point, we've seen various projects like helium originally start with the app chain model and realize, hey, we want to be application engineers. Let's not focus on infrastructure. Let's move to a high throughput like sauna and focus on the product, which is helium network.
00:54:28.242 - 00:55:08.620, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I mean, that's a perfect example. There were actually a couple, like, there was a really cool moment. I think in Solana history last year, you know, yeah, the helium mobile, awesome product. They do radio hotspots for IoT devices now. They have Helio Mobile, decentralized cellular network that is fully running on Solana. They built their own blockchain originally, and they were trying to build a blockchain, maintain a blockchain just for their application, and build a decentralized wireless network product on top of it. And it just like, the product was great and the blockchain kept falling over and they were like, we don't want to deal with this infrastructure.
00:55:08.620 - 00:55:52.470, Speaker A: We just want to focus on our product. And so they came to us, they with, you know, we kind of helped them with the migration. And one of the cool things that was like a really a convergence on a single day, I think it was last summer, maybe it was before that. It's all kind of a blur. So helium minted, I think, like seven or 800,000 compressed nfts on Solana, each one representing a helium hotspot on the helium network. So this was like, over, I don't know, a 24, 48 hours period during that period where we're, like, having all this traffic and all these nfts minted. On Solana, there was the mad lads mint, which at the time was like the biggest and most hyped NFT mint, I think, ever on Solana.
00:55:52.470 - 00:56:43.490, Speaker A: It was one of the biggest NFT mints ever anywhere, I believe. And with a lot of hot NFT mints, you get a ton of bot traffic, you get spam. Network traffic patterns were out of control. And to be honest with you, if this had happened two years prior, these were the kind of things that, like, caused so many, like, network issues and outages in, like, the 2021 timeframe was we had this NFT boom and there was, like, not good traffic, you know, control flow and local fee markets and quic were not implemented yet. This is the kind of thing that would have been like, shit, are they going to kill the network? And everything went off without a hitch. Helium continued to mint for their deep end migration from their own chain with the biggest NFT mint in Madlides happen at the same day. And everything was just like, just humming along.
00:56:43.490 - 00:57:32.224, Speaker A: And that really was like an awesome attestation to the level of improvement and robustness of Solana. Even from 2021 and 2022, when we admittedly had quite a number of performance issues, we had, you know, a couple downtime incidents to 2023 and now 2024, where we're seeing huge amounts of throughput like these crazy mints we had the Jito Airdrop and the Jup Airdrop happen in the last couple weeks, a couple months, and everything is just smooth as butter. And so that's really awesome to see how even in just a year, the tech can really stabilize and, you know, really, really battle harden for these more advanced use cases that we're seeing now.
00:57:32.312 - 00:58:05.786, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's, it's been very impressive. I think there is always kind of, like, the startup pitfalls of, like, moving fast and breaking things versus kind of being a little bit too slow and not being as aggressive. And I think Solana at some times, has prioritized one and then shifted back to another. But it really seems now like the network is, is getting to the point, especially after fire dancer and multiple clients are running the software on the network, that these redundancies and network outages should really be a thing of the past.
00:58:05.898 - 00:59:14.080, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, we have certainly, in the early days, and probably up until relatively recently, definitely taken the move fast and break things model, and that has certainly caused some pain, and it has enabled Solana to iterate really fast, improve things that are broken, and really stay at the forefront. And one of the things that we are pushing now is like, hey, we actually have, there is so much performance overhead baked into the network and so much robustness today that the priority is shifting to continued hardening, really aggressive testing, formal verification, as we prepare for fire dancer to integrate onto mainnet, which will in itself bring all sorts of safety and robustness guarantees. We need to make sure that the house is in order, because as soon as we have a true new client, Anza and Jitto are quite similar. We've got fire dancer coming written in c. We also have a third client called Sig. It's being built by the syndicate team.
00:59:14.080 - 00:59:52.460, Speaker A: They're writing, they're writing their validator in Zig. It's in kind of the earlier stages of development now, but we will have three completely independent validators written in three totally different programming languages in the coming year or couple years. The kind of safety and reliability guarantees we get with a true second validator cannot be overstated. And this actually will make Solana the only chain, other than Ethereum that has two or more than one fully independent validator implementation. So that a bug in one should not be a catastrophic risk to the network.
00:59:52.620 - 01:00:33.008, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's very impressive, and a lot of hard engineering and credit to foundation and others to take those risks, to build multiple client implementations, maybe shifting a little bit. I think you and I are both passionate, kind of, about like the deep end category as a whole, how deepen is really enabling new ways of capital formation, but even particularly around what I like to call digital commodities, but I think you have a different name for them as kind of the compute currency. Can you dive into that specific area of DPN and why you're excited about it?
01:00:33.184 - 01:01:17.610, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, the idea with DPIn is you can use the capital efficiency of a blockchain to bootstrap some physical network that does something out there in the world. It's not just trading meme coins back and forth, but with helium. They have bootstrapped an IoT network. They have bootstrapped a cellular network with token incentives that are unique to the blockchain. They provide these incentives for people to put hotspots on their roofs and hook them up and provide cellular service to their region. Hivemapper sort of a similar model, using the blockchain to stream token payments to build a mapping platform.
01:01:17.610 - 01:02:25.754, Speaker A: And these are really cool examples. And I think what's like, the prescient point here is the capital efficiency of building this token incentivized physical network can allow ambitious small startups to compete with entrenched industry giants. No one could build today with the amount of capital like a cellular network to compete with the coverage of Verizon. If you had to build all the towers and pay for all the antennas and pay for the labor to climb the antennas and install the radios, but it turns out you can, and it's called helium and they are bootstrapping. It's basically like a community driven cellular network where people have incentives to build the infrastructure themselves to provide that service. Similar Hivemapper is competing with Google Maps. I think they have, I don't remember what the latest stats were, something like 810 or more percent of the world's roads.
01:02:25.802 - 01:02:27.530, Speaker B: It was very impressive and like fairly.
01:02:27.570 - 01:03:41.156, Speaker A: Quickly in just a few months, right? Because people who are driving already, Uber drivers, delivery folks, truck drivers, people who spend a lot of time in their car can get the Hivemapper camera, hook it up, provide this street view mapping, and earn rewards for it. And they are getting, they're like rapidly approaching on the kind of coverage that Google Maps Street View has with a much higher time resolution. Google Maps might drive your street once a year, or depending on where you are, maybe more, maybe less in certain areas, in certain cities, Hivemapper is updating daily, maybe multiple times a day, and there's reward curves for where they need coverage. You can do things with this technology like identify potholes or road damage or hazards. And when they've been fixed, and you can push that to some navigation apps that you simply can't do with a street View app that updates only once a year. I think more broadly, which maybe to your question, there's this idea of compute currency, which is, our whole lives are becoming digital. Our economy has become digital.
01:03:41.156 - 01:03:43.972, Speaker A: The way we interact with assets and other people is digital.
01:03:44.076 - 01:03:51.864, Speaker B: Are we sure we're not in or apple glass headsets? It's all elons. We're all in a simulation.
01:03:52.032 - 01:03:56.456, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we might be anyway, in which case, you know, cool, I'm here for it.
01:03:56.528 - 01:04:20.122, Speaker B: The life. It was interesting. I was watching, like, ready player one recently, and, like, it doesn't take too much of like, an imagination to really hopefully envision slightly better world than ready player one. But people have kind of these, uh, virtual reality glasses. You're kind of in the metaverse, and more and more people are kind of doing things online, right?
01:04:20.266 - 01:05:05.890, Speaker A: I mean, I think it's. We underestimate how much things, like how much of our lives really is online, right. If your phone and your laptop just disappeared tomorrow and you could never see them again, like, what would you do? Like, you know, you could figure out a way to eat, hopefully, and feed yourself and shelter yourself. But, like, your work takes place online, your communications are online, your history and your memories, your photos, your email history, like, everything is there. And we currently pay dollars, or we pay with our attention through ads to these service providers for the benefit of letting us use their compute resources. Google gives you gmail for free because they track through your data. They give you nice personalized ads, which people pay for.
01:05:05.890 - 01:06:05.852, Speaker A: So you pay in your time or your dollars for these compute resources, whether you know it or not. I think one of the cool things that crypto and DPIN is like a subset of this is sort of surfacing. What is the compute currency and what people are willing to pay for these resources. And I think there's an interesting example in the convergence of AI and crypto. I think there's some interesting workflows where someone could say, hey, I want to make sure that I'm using AI to do some task, whether it's communication, email, something beyond the silly image generation memes that we're seeing today, funny though they may be, I want to be assured that every time I invoke this LLM, I'm getting the same, it's running through the same LLM so I can get reliable results. Right? And so you could do some sort of cryptographic proof of this is the LLM. This was a training model.
01:06:05.852 - 01:07:07.620, Speaker A: And here's the, you know, and sign with that hash along with the results data, for example. And so you can get like this idea of a repeatable AI agent on demand that I'm willing to pay for or someone else is willing to pay to access this particular model that I, you know, that I trained up or third party trained up. And it's a little meta because blockchains themselves are just distributed compute, right? Like, if you look at the native token, Sol or eth, right? Regardless of the price or your opinions on the monetary aspects, what are these tokens if not ways to pay for distributed compute? Please execute my transaction and change some account balance. And so building basically a whole nother layer on top of that. Here is some token, please execute some compute on my behalf. That is valuable to me, whether it's out in the physical world or in the AI or GPU rendering world.
01:07:09.080 - 01:08:17.602, Speaker B: I like the word digital commodities just because it's like, all right, we need the resources of bandwidth, compute, storage, and those are going to be kind of the commodities of the next revolution of our digital lives. I'm trying to push it, but I don't know if it will catch on. Yeah, very interesting. I think we've touched upon a lot in terms of the community aspect, really some of the ups and downs of not only Solana, but the entire industry, some of the cyclical nature of that kind of now coming through 2024, the kind of upswing that we're on, but really more so from a community aspect. And that community really being battle hardened through some extremely difficult times. And now the community is really taking charge, whether that's mountain Dao, whether that's different hackathons around the world and people just experimenting with the Solana network and saying, this is a cool place to build. It's fast, it's cheap, it's easy, and I can focus on building my application.
01:08:17.602 - 01:08:34.030, Speaker B: And so I think what I'm really excited about for is now kind of less infrastructure, so to speak, as we've kind of been alluding to, and more focus on the applications and what people can ultimately build on Solana. And that's what I'm personally excited for 2024.
01:08:34.490 - 01:08:35.670, Speaker A: Couldn't agree more.
01:08:36.959 - 01:08:45.019, Speaker B: Is there anything particular that you kind of want to, as we wrap up the podcast that you want to double click on or make sure people are kind of aware of?
01:08:47.399 - 01:09:16.826, Speaker A: I don't know, just come on in. The water is fine. Try Solana. There's a ton of awesome apps out there for people to just experiencing Solana, if you've only ever used, say, ethel one, is like a viscerally different experience. You don't have to love it for whatever your reasons, but just give it a try. There's a cool app that we built actually years ago as a demo, and I think it's still pertinent today. It's called break.
01:09:16.826 - 01:09:53.180, Speaker A: It's break dot Solana.com and it's a keyboard mashing game. Every time you smash the spaceboard, it sends a transaction and it's just a live stream of all your pending transactions from keyboard smash and watching the tale of them switch from red to green as they confirm. Just like that. And you can go look on the block explorer and see every single transaction that landed. It's not just a front end, and that has been the aha moment or the iPhone moment for people coming to Solana of the first time, you're like, oh, this is what it's supposed to feel like. Come try it.
01:09:53.180 - 01:09:54.160, Speaker A: See what you think.
01:09:54.500 - 01:10:04.420, Speaker B: All right, maybe as we wrap up just a couple rapid fire questions, maybe throw a couple spicy ones in there. Is fire dancer overhyped or under hyped?
01:10:04.500 - 01:10:05.084, Speaker A: Under hyped.
01:10:05.132 - 01:10:19.480, Speaker B: Under hyped. There's other kind of networks, primarily based out of Silicon Valley. Any thoughts around competition with these other networks in the high throughput space?
01:10:20.700 - 01:10:58.690, Speaker A: It's something that we definitely keep an eye on for sure. I think no one should be so proud as to think just because we might be the incumbent or the bigger player now that were going to be forever. Key example, BlackBerry once had 95% of the mobile market and now they have zero. But yeah, I think one can write faster languages and fork a blockchain and learn from a playbook. What you cannot fork is a community. And I think Solana has one of the most feral, awesome, and committed communities of builders that don't want to be anywhere else awesome.
01:10:59.550 - 01:11:05.130, Speaker B: L two s. Cool. Restaking.
01:11:08.150 - 01:11:14.022, Speaker A: Interesting in theory, possibly some very unexplored risks on the edge cases.
01:11:14.166 - 01:11:30.408, Speaker B: Cool. Well, Dan, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Thanks for nerding out on with me through the ups and downs and really appreciate what Solana foundation has done for entire globe. I think we're really at the press of piss of something special and appreciate all your hard work throughout the years.
01:11:30.504 - 01:11:31.520, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you very much.
