00:00:00.320 - 00:00:29.001, Speaker A: So where I think there's always interesting opportunities for net new innovation is like combining technical innovation, operating leverage and financial engineering together. Right. Those three are really the only levers we have. I think any investor should think about sort of that's the framework I use is what's the technology innovation? How does this allow me to increase my operating leverage, I.e. compressed costs or increase profitability. Right. Make it easier for me to do what I'm trying to do, make it cheaper.
00:00:29.001 - 00:01:13.385, Speaker A: And then how does it involve an element or aspect of financial engineering? Because I do think blockchains are fundamentally optimized for that. And what's really cool to me about bitcoin and just crypto more broadly is it's really the first time in modern history that we've seen the creation of a financial market entirely outside of the existing capital markets ecosystem that wasn't led by banks, it wasn't led by hedge funds, it wasn't led, you know, by the existing sort of players within financial ecosystem system. Entirely new institutions. Right. Bitcoin, you know, is, is a really large asset class coinbase by assets under custody is a top 20 bank. That's pretty profound, I think. And that's only going to increase and accelerate.
00:01:16.165 - 00:01:26.225, Speaker B: We're in Korea, South Korea at aptos Blockchain week or aptos Experience. And then also kbw Kitty W. Yes.
00:01:26.265 - 00:01:28.441, Speaker A: Yeah. Shout out to hashed.
00:01:28.553 - 00:01:29.217, Speaker B: Shout out.
00:01:29.321 - 00:01:32.057, Speaker A: Yeah, they've been around a long time. They have good event.
00:01:32.241 - 00:01:47.817, Speaker B: It was, it's, it's been really interesting. I think it's only my second time in Korea and so it's kind of like the first time you go to Europe and explore a different part of the world. It's very unique. But there's a lot of crypto things happening here.
00:01:47.921 - 00:01:54.227, Speaker A: There is a lot of not dancing at clubs with loud feet.
00:01:54.331 - 00:01:56.227, Speaker B: Yes, yes. We try to avoid that.
00:01:56.371 - 00:01:59.147, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been going to bed early. It's really nice.
00:01:59.251 - 00:01:59.779, Speaker B: That is true.
00:01:59.827 - 00:02:01.043, Speaker A: I'm in my cozy era.
00:02:01.099 - 00:02:02.835, Speaker B: I think you gotta own it.
00:02:02.915 - 00:02:03.923, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:02:04.059 - 00:02:19.065, Speaker B: Cool. Well, I again really appreciate you coming on the podcast. I have been a long time admirer of kind of what you have built and appreciate how you played the game. Really. I think.
00:02:19.845 - 00:02:21.625, Speaker A: How do I play the game, Logan?
00:02:22.445 - 00:02:54.809, Speaker B: Long term playing long term games. There's finite games and long term games and I think you've done really exceptional about creating your own niche in the space, owning that and navigating the cycles within crypto, which is not easy. And so I would love to start the podcast with just a little Bit about your background and also just like you navigating the different cycles, starting with Bitcoin, enterprise blockchains, you've kind of seen it all.
00:02:54.937 - 00:03:34.065, Speaker A: ICOs version one, DeFi, now deepin ICOs version two. Okay, so I'll keep the story really short. I feel like I've done so much origin story, but I think in the context where it's really relevant with what I'm spending my time on now. I started my career in the oil and gas industry, started more on the trading side, focused on ethanol, methanol and all carbon credits. Left college during the great financial crisis, so really different time in the world, right? Implementation of Dodd Frank, spent a lot of time on that. Basel III compliance, which is banking regulation, increasing capital requirements for banks. Spent a lot of time on that.
00:03:34.065 - 00:04:13.677, Speaker A: Did a lot of work kind of in house at oil and gas companies. Went out to the oil field, coal mines, refineries, onshore offshore shale, sagd, which is like Northern Canada, Steam assisted gravity drainage. Worked on a mining equipment merger in China. Just did a lot of different things for the first five years of my career, I'd say. And then I think in that sort of process, what I had never heard of startups really, right? Like I used Facebook in college and obviously Facebook was sort of popularized by that absolutely terrible movie. But I didn't really know what a startup was like. I was in that culture.
00:04:13.677 - 00:04:58.645, Speaker A: I was in oil and gas world and industrials, right? And then I went to grad school and for the first time I was exposed to startups and venture capital. I was like, wow, this is. People will just give you money for ideas. I'm like, this is wild. How do I do this? And then at the same time was getting deeper into Bitcoin and I had the luck of being at MIT at the same time as Dan Ellitzer, German Jeremy Rubin, Christian Catalini, a bunch of people who are, you know, have done a lot in the crypto space and so ended up, you know, didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. Met Ryan Selkis and Barry Silbert. They were starting dcg and I was like, okay, I think I can like help you.
00:04:58.645 - 00:05:35.985, Speaker A: This makes sense to me. Joined dcg, is the first like big risk I'd taken in my career, I'd say, or in my life. And then from there things just sort of snowballed. And I think my sort of guiding compass, navigating the world of crypto is at DCG for three years. Really proud of what we built in the Three years I was there, but I went through really interesting time. DCG was very anti Ethereum when Ethereum first emerged, put all its weight behind Ethereum Classic, which was interesting. And then we also lived through the block size wars, right.
00:05:35.985 - 00:06:25.805, Speaker A: So in 2017, you know, there was this proposal called the New York Agreement. And it was just interesting watching the way that the Bitcoin core ecosystem was evolving, developing obviously very different approaches to scaling. And my sort of guiding principle has always been the most important thing in any sort of industry is relationships and community. And I think at DCG we did a great job building a strong community of founders around DCG and a strong community of partners. And I think after the block size wars and after the Ethereum Classic fork, maybe some of that trust and goodwill was eroded a bit. And so I made the decision to step back from DCG. I left in early 2018, thought I was going to take some time off, maybe angel Invest.
00:06:25.805 - 00:07:00.161, Speaker A: And then I met the Coinshares team, Ex commodities guys. So direct, so straightforward, just really pragmatic. And I was like, great, I can, I can do work here. We spent, I spent five and a half years building CoinShares with them. Great experience. Took IT public in 2021, grew it to 7 billion assets under management, sort of expanded the business, acquired some businesses, just tried a lot of different things within the context of how do you serve both retail and institutional client base as an asset manager. So that was interesting.
00:07:00.161 - 00:07:59.041, Speaker A: And then left Coinshares early this year, started 2024. Because I had just been thinking about talking about this thesis around energy computation, cryptocurrency for so long. And with the rise of depin and the growth of render bittensor helium, I feel and the rise of deep tech investing on the traditional venture side, right. I think a 16Z with their American Dynamism Fund, that was a huge step into capital availability, like becoming more of capital, becoming more available for early stage deep tech hardware, like hard infra, hard science focused companies for the first time in a long time. Hardware has been very unsexy for the last 15 years. Like Bitcoin was the only industry that was really investing heavily in hardware. Primarily driven right by bitcoin mining and then a little bit by the GPU boom from Ethereum's Proof of Work mining back in 2020, 2021.
00:07:59.041 - 00:08:40.067, Speaker A: But I was like, okay, it's go time, it's time to now do this. And so I spent the last, I would say five months or so really putting the pieces together of what I think I want to do next. But in this process, I think the biggest sort of guiding principle for me surviving the cycles has been it's never as good as you think it is and it's never as bad as you think it is. Assume you know nothing, right. So I think intellectual humility and also just being constant mindset that you know nothing and there's always more to learn has been really helpful. And then building relationships like help people out. I will literally talk to anyone you can dm.
00:08:40.067 - 00:08:57.075, Speaker A: I will talk to anyone. People ask me for favors all the time. I'm happy to help people. And really showing up for people when no one else will I think is really important. I feel sometimes this industry can be really transactional. That that's just not my style, I think. Yeah, just be kind.
00:08:57.075 - 00:09:11.595, Speaker A: You don't have to be nice, but be kind. And it's like, don't be an asshole. A lot of people in crypto, they get one thing right over a very short duration of time and they just get really aggressive about it. And I'm like, just relax.
00:09:12.215 - 00:09:31.907, Speaker B: Yeah. It is pretty remarkable within crypto just how much the asset class has really grown over the last five years that you can get one thing right, become fairly wealthy and then do continue your investing career or personal investing and just get a lot of things wrong and.
00:09:31.931 - 00:09:35.491, Speaker A: Never get it right again. In many such cases. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:35.603 - 00:09:47.819, Speaker B: And so I think that humility is extremely important to just realize that the industry is compounding at a high growth rate, playing the long term games. And I think, well, it's like, are.
00:09:47.827 - 00:10:11.443, Speaker A: You capturing market beta? Right. Are you actually delivering alpha? I ask myself that question all the time. I think as an investor that's a question you always ask yourself. And I think particularly as a venture builder and a venture investor, because I've always been in these kind of hybrid roles where you're both building firms and operating an investment firm. Right. Which is a little bit different. Now I'm doing Pure Play Ventures.
00:10:11.443 - 00:10:28.837, Speaker A: So that's new for me because historically I've been in kind of this hybrid role, but I think, you know, it takes time. The arc of time is very long. And so I'm now almost a decade into this journey, I'm still trying to figure out am I any good at this? To be determined.
00:10:28.981 - 00:10:58.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I think everybody should continuously ask themselves that. And you're really only as good as your last deal, so to speak. I think one thing that to me again is super interesting about how you've approached it is being in the game for the long term. And Focusing on not playing the short term games when there's all these potential pitfalls, snares, snags.
00:10:59.015 - 00:11:02.315, Speaker A: But you know what? The thing is, you have to have fun.
00:11:02.695 - 00:11:04.463, Speaker B: And I think you do that exceptionally well.
00:11:04.559 - 00:11:37.371, Speaker A: I really enjoy it. It's. It's fun. Think about what we've done in the last decade. We memed a global reserve currency into existence like a bunch of crazy people on the Internet. And obviously there's so many people who have worked so hard for so many years to get the industry, and Bitcoin in particular as an asset class to where it is. But it really is like a bunch of strangers on the Internet getting together and uniting around this common cause.
00:11:37.371 - 00:11:43.415, Speaker A: And we've had disagreements along the way, but if you're not having, you could literally do anything else with your time.
00:11:44.515 - 00:11:45.603, Speaker B: Why choose crypto?
00:11:45.699 - 00:11:54.075, Speaker A: You gotta have a little bit of fun because it is objectively really fucking funny. Yeah, this industry is wild. It's funny.
00:11:54.235 - 00:12:20.485, Speaker B: There are definitely lots of characters. I. And I appreciate that about you. I think there to your point, there's a lot of people that got lucky were right about one thing. And I think even with Venture though it is kind of strange because 9 out of 10 investments could go to zero. And you just have to be right about one unique thing. Yeah, I don't know.
00:12:20.485 - 00:12:47.685, Speaker B: We do live in a funny space. It is entertaining. But I think we like playing these games and I'm excited for the future because it's still. I know everybody says it's early. I know it's not as early as it was when it was bitcoin only. But I think a couple of things that you mentioned upon were energy and compute. Those are really exciting things that I think are just now becoming possible with more scalable blockchains.
00:12:47.685 - 00:13:26.463, Speaker B: But how I first kind of got introduced to you was through your first breakpoint talk in 2021. And it was really around the financialization of computer. And I thought it was such a brilliant talk because it did tell a story and you could connect all those dots about selling block space and how it ultimately end up fungible. And I was really captivated about your storytelling and how ultimately you could try to communicate some of these more complex ideas. Simply, I would love to go a little bit deeper on your ideas around the financialization of computer.
00:13:26.629 - 00:13:58.583, Speaker A: Yes. And that was such a fun break point. That was the first, the very top. Yeah, it was great. Just Solana ecosystem was on fire also top ticked sole price. Okay. So I think at that point in time, so in 2021 one of the things that was becoming really apparent, particularly with Bitcoin transaction fees and Ethereum transaction fees, which I think again has made the Solana narrative so potent, right, Is the fact that Bitcoin transaction fees and Ethereum transaction fees were spiking due to demand for block space.
00:13:58.583 - 00:15:16.005, Speaker A: And one of the things that I've consistently believed is you need to have persistent fee paying demand for block space for your blockchain and your token to have value, right? So persistent fee paying demand is a really difficult thing because there's now a plethora of block space, right? There's so much block space, whether it's on L1s, L2s, app chain, there's just a proliferation of block space and there's not enough applications, use cases, demand fee paying demand, right? Somebody has to pay that fee to fill that block space. And that's why I think you see a lot of this narrative around infrastructure cycle, app cycle, right? How it's sort of this recursive chicken and egg cycle where first you build the infrastructure a plethora of block space, then because blockchain space prices come down so dramatically, you can then have all these new applications, you see spike in demand, that block space gets filled, then you get the creation of new block space. So it's sort of this recursive cycle. But really what that's articulating, I think, and everyone in crypto loves to talk about like first principles. Okay, let's talk really practically from the mindset of someone who thinks about commodities, right? Block space is a commodity. Bitcoin block space is pricing secure financial transactions on the Bitcoin network, which is the most secure financial network in the world. Right.
00:15:16.005 - 00:16:24.715, Speaker A: Etherium is pricing financial computation on the Ethereum network. Right? Ethereum gas fees blob space, right. Is pricing data availability. Right? There's all of these different primitives that are now merging in these different constructions that are pricing these digital commodities. And so what really was interesting to me in 2021 when the Solana narrative really started to take off because of low transaction fees, is how do you think about pricing financial comput. Right? And there are different types of financial computation that are really specified and useful in different instances, and my view is Bitcoin is sort of like the canonical chain, where Bitcoin is like the canonical world Fidelity machine, where it's sort of the record of choice just because Bitcoin's fees are so high, I think a lot of transactions don't require the security or the Fidelity or the permanence of Sort of Bitcoin can be done elsewhere. Ethereum, I think right now has a strong lead on more complex financial computation.
00:16:24.715 - 00:16:57.755, Speaker A: I don't know if that will persist. I'm not an expert on sort of Ethereum community dynamics, but I certainly feel like from a community perspective, Ethereum is kind of going through the era that Bitcoin went through where there are differences in vision around the direction Ethereum takes. You see that now, right? You have the Ethereum foundation approach to scaling. You have projects like Mega Eth trying to take a different approach to scaling setting. Be interesting to, to see what direction that goes. Obviously a lot of activity has now moved to L2s. Whether that's optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon now base as well.
00:16:57.755 - 00:17:28.017, Speaker A: But this idea that we're creating these net new digital commodities that allow people to effectively price financial computation, I thought was really interesting and something we've never seen before because for the first time you're creating an independent fee market and you've never seen that in the history of capital markets before. And so I became really captivated by that idea. And just also more broadly, this idea that anyone could be a market maker, right? Which I think is another, like, really interesting mindset shift.
00:17:28.121 - 00:17:55.289, Speaker B: And this was at the. Towards the end of your talk. And I think I try to go back and listen to a couple of your calls before this talks, before this podcast. And I think that's very interesting because historically it is only the sophisticated actors. Now you have AMMs. You could potentially even have a Joe Smo retail person provide liquidity in an order book. It's very interesting, I think.
00:17:55.337 - 00:18:16.433, Speaker A: And that's to me what Solana became so interesting. And I do think Solana has done such a great job capturing this narrative around sort of the retail trader. And I know this gets talked about a lot. Everyone in crypto talks about retail as though this is the holy grail of retail needs to come back. And I'm like, yeah, no, let's. We do not need to. We do not need to be doing that.
00:18:16.433 - 00:18:39.816, Speaker A: I think the story is really about how do we allow a broader range of market participants to participate, how do we create deeper liquidity? And instead of fragmenting liquidity, aggregate liquidity, which I think is one of the beautiful things about cryptos. Like crypto is this big hot ball of money, right? Historically, moving money around is in the U.S. you know, used to be T +2. We're now supposedly on T +1.
00:18:39.880 - 00:18:40.139, Speaker B: Supposedly.
00:18:40.203 - 00:19:46.567, Speaker A: Supposedly. SupposedLY. I just read a really interesting article a few days ago about the just the fundamental challenges of the implementation of T +1, right, because banking infrastructure is very archaic and it requires copying and pasting data between a bunch of separate data warehouses, right? That's like the banking system is just a bunch of different data database entries and you have to do a ton of reconciliation. And there's a lot of effort that goes into this process is sort of creating one canonical version of financial truth. And what I think so fun about this new ecosystem of blockchains we're seeing, especially the speed at which you can now bridge assets and move assets around the proliferation of stablecoins and I think the broader institutional trust we're seeing in stablecoins is you no longer have people moving their assets on and off chain. Like once my I move assets on chain, I generally don't ever really move them off chain because I can warehouse in usdc, usdt, susd, right? Which is the non centralized sort of alternative, although it's mostly USDC at this point. So there's all of these different alternatives that I now have.
00:19:46.567 - 00:21:34.023, Speaker A: And what I think becomes so interesting is okay, more money on chain moving more quickly, chasing opportunities more quickly. Duration of trades is being compressed dramatically, right? The perp as well, I think as a contract structure has encouraged that, right? And so all of a sudden you see like a compression of the trade lifecycle, an acceleration of how quickly capital can cycle. And as more and more money moves on chain from these different buckets, whether it's institutional firms like a Jane street or Two Sigma or Jump or Cumberland, right, Participating on chain, or it's retail traders aggregating through these different defi front ends that abstract out some of the complexity of this underlying yield farming or these underlying arbitrage trades and making that available to these pools of capital, right? There's all of these really interesting opportunities emerging that make the ball of money bigger and hotter. And that to me is really fundamentally interesting. Because financial engineering I think is a frontier that is effectively limitless, right? Technical innovation has a frontier that is sort of finite and defined, right? We have the laws of physics that sort of constrain what is possible, the laws of thermodynamics in terms of operating leverage. A lot of SaaS I think was about operating leverage, right? Which is compressing the time from strategy to execution through the use of SaaS or creating operating leverage by compressing the cost right through this sort of vertical integration like a hyperscaler is a great example of this. I think on the operating leverage side there's limitation to what levers you can Pull you can to compress costs and to speed up time, cycle time.
00:21:34.023 - 00:21:51.663, Speaker A: But the financial engineering frontier is sort of this unbounded limitless space where you can create all of these really interesting permutations. And now having this big hot ball of money that can move at the speed of, I don't know, however fast you can transmit your packets. That's cool.
00:21:51.759 - 00:22:37.045, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think your point around, I mean the engineering of the old tradfi system is literally just banks that do like batch processing, T plus 1, T plus 2. And the cool thing about blockchains is just collapsing those heterogeneous databases into one real time database. And I think one thing that I have always appreciated was the physics as well. And now that we have these high throughput blockchains that can propagate more data, I think it makes more interesting applications. So you can continue to experiment with the financial engineering. The velocity of a dollar I think you have kind of touched upon, which is really interesting.
00:22:37.045 - 00:22:47.705, Speaker B: Once you have native currencies, fiat currencies on blockchains, and you're just increasing the velocity of the dollar, continuing the different experimentations.
00:22:48.725 - 00:23:34.045, Speaker A: And I think that has always been what's so interesting to me is with each sort of net new innovation in crypto, which to be candid, I feel like I'm not sure how much of what's happening right now feels like net new innovation to me. I feel like we've selected a few parameters and we're just like optimizing around technical parameters, but we don't necessarily have proven demand for that functionality. Right. I think zero knowledge proofs like a great category where we've seen and I'm not skeptical, I see the potential. I just think from a timing perspective there's been so much capital that's gone into that space, building infrastructure and making block space available. Right. In zero knowledge sort of proof chains.
00:23:34.045 - 00:24:14.949, Speaker A: And I'm not really clear where the demand for those applications and for that block place is coming from. So I think there are some really interesting challenges there. And again, who knows, I've invested in these things because I think it's important to make bets selectively in these net new narratives. But then we see this over capitalization, right? Where it's like by the time you get to the 15th one you're like okay, let's try something different. So where I think there's always interesting opportunities for net new innovation is like combining technical innovation, operating leverage and financial engineering together. Right. Those three are really the only levers we have.
00:24:14.949 - 00:24:46.223, Speaker A: I think any investor should think about sort of, that's the framework I use is what's the technology innovation? How does this allow me to increase my operating leverage, I.e. compressed costs or increase profitability. Right. Make it easier for me to do what I'm trying to do, make it cheaper. And then how does it involve an element or aspect of financial engineering? Because I do think blockchains are fundamentally optimized for that. And everything in the human experience is. And everything in our modern society is about transactions.
00:24:46.223 - 00:24:50.635, Speaker A: Right. Whether they're explicitly priced or implicitly priced through opportunity cost.
00:24:52.135 - 00:25:13.441, Speaker B: And yeah, I think what you're getting at is create better products, not better crypto products. Reduce, make things more efficient so that you can either make more money, make a better product. Crypto is a tool to make the products, but the tool isn't crypto itself. Yes.
00:25:13.553 - 00:25:24.345, Speaker A: Other than I think like bitcoin, certainly bitcoin's a unique. Bitcoin's very unique. And I know a lot of people. Do you think we're done with the cycle of people making the next bitcoin?
00:25:25.725 - 00:25:36.053, Speaker B: I mean, no, because you have people experimenting with like Bitcoin L2s, like you have ordinals, taproot, kind of unlocked a lot of unique possibilities.
00:25:36.149 - 00:25:41.261, Speaker A: That's innovation on top of bitcoin. But do you remember we went through this era where people were like, we're creating a better bitcoin?
00:25:41.333 - 00:25:41.845, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:41.965 - 00:25:42.989, Speaker A: Are we done with that?
00:25:43.077 - 00:26:04.675, Speaker B: Probably. But I feel like we're running it back in a sense with all the L2 stuff. I mean, I'm very curious to see how the Bitcoin L2 is going to play out. I think if you want to do more smart contract kind of experimentation that will be done on chains that provide more flexibility.
00:26:05.055 - 00:26:24.501, Speaker A: I mean, the way I view it is, I think I'm excited about bitcoin innovation. Right. And it's been slow to mature for a variety of different reasons. Like you had lightning sort of leading the charge for a number of years. And lightning was fundamentally constrained by bitcoin core. Right. And so I think now you have people trying to open up a new design space.
00:26:24.501 - 00:26:43.945, Speaker A: And the biggest carrot I think is like Bitcoin's BTC is 54%. Right. Bitcoin's dominance ratio is at a four year high, 54%. It's a lot of money. And people look at that and they say, okay, look at the TVL and DeFi. Look at the TVL and Bitcoin. Right now the primary implementation of defi and bitcoin is wrapped bitcoin right.
00:26:43.945 - 00:27:13.467, Speaker A: And there's, that's obviously that's a multi sig with Bitco which now Tron Slash, Justin sun acquired that price. So like not really sure how that's going to evolve. Then you had keep make some progress with TBTC and they're kind of continuing down that route. Stacks is now making progress with sbtc. So I think trying to find non custodial ways to like bridge bitcoin to either an L2 or an EVM chain where you can utilize bitcoin in these net new ways is interesting.
00:27:13.531 - 00:27:14.211, Speaker B: I agree.
00:27:14.363 - 00:28:09.815, Speaker A: I think structurally Bitcoin's very different though because like 15 to 20% of all Bitcoin in circulation is probably right according to some coinshares research is held by institutional holders. They don't have a mandate to earn yield on their Bitcoin necessarily. And again the risk return profile of you know, bitcoin and at this point 93 of all, 93% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist have been mined. Whereas you know, if you look at other chains that are highly inflationary have 10% inflation per year where only 10, 20% of the nets of the net supply has been mined or brought into creation there I think maybe you're willing to take more risk because there's this incredible dilution that's still going to happen in Bitcoin. I think much less so because the supply and demand economics of bitcoin make it really challenging if you lose your Bitcoin or there's some sort of catastrophic event that happens. Right. To reacquire that bitcoin at a similar cost basis.
00:28:09.815 - 00:28:23.683, Speaker A: So I'm not convinced that bitcoin holders are going to be fundamentally more risk seeking. But I do think it's. Even if it's 10%, that's a fairly large category, that's $140 billion. So it's a opportunity worth chasing. Right.
00:28:23.739 - 00:28:36.335, Speaker B: That's a large market. I'm definitely for the experimentation of exporting bitcoin and trying to make it in a non custodial way to other ecosystems to continue the financial engineering.
00:28:36.685 - 00:29:08.005, Speaker A: I mean and look I think it's, I think people get really skeptical of financial engineering. But this is what I loved about working in the oil industry and the commodities industry. The commodities industry like has really been at the forefront of creativity and financial engineering because you are dealing with financing projects that are 20 year projects. Right. I worked on a project in Equatorial guinea for example, or actually the better example is Papua New Guinea. Right. Papua New guinea is an island.
00:29:08.005 - 00:29:49.215, Speaker A: Right. The GDP of Papua New guinea is teeny tiny, okay? So $40 billion project, $40 billion project to extract natural gas from the highlands of Papua New guinea, which are, you know, there's pygmy tribes that live there that have not had contact with humans. You then pipe that gas 400 miles down from the highlands to the coast, you build a liquefaction train to liquefy the lng. And then now you can supply LNG easily to the APAC region. Right? Because historically shipping costs have been quite high. If you're closer to apac, shipping costs are low. And also it's a huge gas field, so like there's real opportunity there.
00:29:49.215 - 00:30:12.349, Speaker A: So all of a sudden you have to figure out, how do I finance this? What's my cost of capital going to be? How do I manage the logistics of this? How do I deal with this duration risk? Because it's going to take years and years to develop this. It involves these really complex multi decade deal structures. It involves a really volatile asset, Oil. Right. Oil is like fairly volatile. Volatile. Pardon.
00:30:12.349 - 00:31:07.533, Speaker A: And now with the financialization of oil and commodities, right. Paper volume is 30x physically traded spot. So you have oil prices being much more responsive to macro speculation, exogenous factors outside of what's happening within the oil industry. And so it creates this really unique challenge, right, from a project financing perspective. And so you have all of this really creative financial engineering that happens in the oil and gas industry. And I just think it was really cool to be in that environment where you have people who are very comfortable slinging tens of billions of dollars on highly speculative investments and being really creative in terms of how they finance that, how they hedge it, how they try to reduce some of the risk inherent in those types of activities. Same thing with financial engineering and crypto.
00:31:07.533 - 00:31:51.959, Speaker A: I feel like there's all of these really interesting opportunities and these really interesting ways to deal with some of the fundamental structural inefficiencies that exist in capital markets today. And what's really cool to me about Bitcoin and just crypto more broadly is it's really the first time in modern history that we've seen the creation of a financial market entirely outside of the existing capital markets ecosystem system that wasn't led by banks, it wasn't led by hedge funds, it wasn't led, you know, by the existing sort of players within the financial ecosystem. Entirely new institutions. Right. Bitcoin, you know, is, is a really large asset class coinbase by assets under custody is a top 20 bank. That's pretty profound. I think.
00:31:51.959 - 00:31:54.355, Speaker A: And that's only going to increase and accelerate.
00:31:54.775 - 00:32:01.855, Speaker B: I think one of the interesting parts about cryptos, you have kind of the NFT degens. You have engineers.
00:32:01.895 - 00:32:03.435, Speaker A: You're still doing NFTs.
00:32:03.855 - 00:32:06.655, Speaker B: Maybe we'll run it back. Okay, maybe we'll run it back.
00:32:06.735 - 00:32:14.991, Speaker A: All right. You know, I looked at my NFT wallet the other day, and I just had such a good laugh. Yeah, it was so funny.
00:32:15.103 - 00:32:20.383, Speaker B: I got rugged on one NFT for a decent amount, and that was kind of the end of my.
00:32:20.399 - 00:32:22.315, Speaker A: What was that name? And shame. What was the nft?
00:32:22.775 - 00:32:30.011, Speaker B: It was. I bought one of the pico tops of the Solana monkey business and wrote it down, and it was very painful.
00:32:30.203 - 00:32:57.305, Speaker A: Oh, I bought a shout out to Tristan Iver from Backpack. We're on a ski trip, and he was shilling me, or he was talking up Solana flag monkeys, which is like a very esoteric nft. They would come up with a new flag monkey, I think, every week, and then auction it off. And I think when Seoul was at its peak, I paid like 90 souls for a flag monkey.
00:32:58.325 - 00:33:00.381, Speaker B: And what is it now? Zero.
00:33:00.493 - 00:33:05.285, Speaker A: Zero. Yeah. But I still have. I have my ether rock. I have some.
00:33:05.325 - 00:33:07.269, Speaker B: I bought some exclusive community.
00:33:07.397 - 00:33:17.293, Speaker A: It is. I do love my rock friends. I bought some Milady's when I was really drunk. That's done.
00:33:17.349 - 00:33:18.693, Speaker B: Well, there you go.
00:33:18.749 - 00:33:22.549, Speaker A: My pudgy penguin was stolen. It's the only time I've ever had crypto stolen.
00:33:22.637 - 00:33:23.233, Speaker B: Oh, no.
00:33:23.349 - 00:33:25.041, Speaker A: Very sad. I have some mad lads.
00:33:25.153 - 00:33:25.805, Speaker B: Nice.
00:33:27.105 - 00:33:31.169, Speaker A: A lot of crypto dick butts. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of crypto dick butts.
00:33:31.297 - 00:33:40.337, Speaker B: I think that goes back to your personality of trying to create things and just have fun with the space. Yeah, for sure.
00:33:40.441 - 00:34:01.335, Speaker A: The way I learn, I'm a tinkerer, like a tinkerer and a wanderer. I learn by just doing things. Yeah. So crypto dick butts for me was like, that was tinkering. And it was just really funny because I think people have this expectation. They're like, oh, institutional crypto. And I'm like, crypto dick butts.
00:34:02.395 - 00:34:28.463, Speaker B: That's a good meme. But, like, you have these different types. You have the NFT people, you have the engineers, you have the people that come from a more finance background. And crypto is kind of this black hole that attracts these different people, but it influences how you kind of think about things. My background is definitely a little bit more engineering, product focus. But what was.
00:34:28.519 - 00:34:31.515, Speaker A: What was your first aha moment where you were like, whoa?
00:34:31.895 - 00:34:41.279, Speaker B: I was really excited about ETH and kind of the ICO phase in 2017, I thought it was very smart for a little bit of time and quickly got humbled.
00:34:41.327 - 00:34:44.015, Speaker A: In 2018 you were like, tokenize everything.
00:34:44.175 - 00:35:37.813, Speaker B: Exactly. And so I think throughout 2018 and 19, the thing that got me really excited about Ethereum and more broadly, kind of like Defi, was the composability nature. I realized that you can push yourself very hard, and we did at Tesla, but if you have kind of these Defi logo blocks that are more composable, you can tap into kind of these open APIs, so to speak, you can't really compete with that compounding long term. Even though Tesla, you work 100 hour weeks, if everybody's kind of compounding their different applications on top of each other, it got me really excited about the speed of that innovation. So it was kind of an aha moment. But then I got really pissed off when I paid $1,000 for my Uniswap transfer. And I was like, this is not the future of France.
00:35:37.989 - 00:36:15.037, Speaker A: Yeah, well. And I think again that goes back to where we started this conversation is I definitely went through that era as well. Right. In late 2020, early 21, when you were paying thousands of dollars to get transactions through because Ethereum was so congested, there was so much demand for block space. Right. That if you wanted to get your transaction through, you had to pay high fees. And I think that really, for me, the light bulb that went off was, wait a minute, like this is a new commodity market, this is a net, new design space.
00:36:15.141 - 00:36:53.837, Speaker B: And this is what I wanted to ask you about because I think your background and kind of being a commodities trader has given you this very unique lens on the world that I may not have or the average crypto degen may not have. And so I'm curious just how this kind of influences your investing style as a fund or how you're continuing to think about it. I think your talks in the past about the financialization of COMPUTE are very interesting. But that background of, hey, I'm think of this all as kind of commodities or a different lens from the trading aspect. And the financial engineering is very interesting.
00:36:53.981 - 00:37:42.325, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe I'll just give everyone who's watching this a few frameworks. I think it's really one of the things I like to do and I get called a boomer for this. I like making slides because I think anytime I'm trying and I think being able to tell a story is really important, it actually takes me quite a bit of time to figure out what I want to say, which is why I like signing up to do talks, because that's pressure on me to write a story so I know what stories I need to be writing. And if I give myself the pressure of a date by which I need to figure out what the story is and commit it to paper with visuals, then I know I'm going to do that. Because I need some stress to perform. I think that's like, that's.
00:37:42.365 - 00:37:45.425, Speaker B: I think we all do. It's good to have a timeline and someone holds your stuff.
00:37:45.845 - 00:37:50.101, Speaker A: They're methodical and. No, I need the pressure.
00:37:50.173 - 00:37:50.807, Speaker B: I'm the same.
00:37:50.901 - 00:38:13.643, Speaker A: I need that. Yeah, okay. It's psychotic, actually. It's quite unwell, quite unhinged. The first framework I want to start with is the concept of a value chain. Every product we consume, every resource we use has a unique and specific value chain. If we look at, for example, the compute value chain.
00:38:13.643 - 00:38:53.717, Speaker A: The compute value chain is a very simple one. It starts with capex acquisition that is unique. Then you need to put those chips in a data center, right? So you have to set up infrastructure racking. Then you need to electrify that data center, right? So you've got your capex, that's your chips, you've got your infrastructure, which is your data center. Then you've got electrification, which I think is a separate category. Then you've got ongoing operations, energy management, cooling, right? Because heat is the primary output of computation. Then you've got the actual product you're delivering to an end customer, right? The computation is being consumed by an end customer.
00:38:53.717 - 00:40:15.785, Speaker A: So how do you deliver that to them? In the instance, you know, the hyperscalers, it's like an AWS EC3 or in the case of storage and S3 for DigitalOcean, right? It's different, but you have sort of a product expression which is how people access that compute service. And then you've got customer service on top of that, right? How do you sort of service and maintain those accounts? That's like billing and all of the other kind of more enterprise sassy type of stuff. But that's the compute value chain, okay? And then I look at that value chain and I say, okay, what are all of the leverage points within this value chain? So right now the leverage point is the capex, right? Chips are like the new oil, they're in scarce supply. The supply demand imbalance right now is heavily favoring chips. And also what's really interesting, if you are a chip maker, that is what made Nvidia the most valuable company in the world and allowed it to rise so meteorically in a very short time is their capex receiver. So out of all of the MAG7 stocks right now all of them are paying capex to Nvidia, right? So Nvidia is a net capex receiver of the capex of all of these other hyperscalers. So then what's interesting is you start looking at that value chain, you start understanding where different players fit within that value chain and how value transfer happens between each layer, right? So I've just articulated the capex receiver thesis, which is why I think if I'm looking at public equities, semis is a good place to invest.
00:40:15.785 - 00:41:18.679, Speaker A: If I'm a venture investor, maybe I say to myself, what's the next iteration in the semi space? Whether that's photonics, whether, you know, it's bio compute, something like an extrapolic, which I think still very far out just in terms of duration and timeline. But then you can sort of start to form a thesis, right, and start to really understand how each layer of the value chain works, what the value chain is going to look like. Right now the thematic in compute is vertical integration, right? So you used to see data center operators providing services to sort of these sellers of compute. Now all of the hyperscalers own their own data centers. They're buying their own power, they're co locating with their own power. In some instances they may even be financing electrification themselves. So you start to see this, you see Apple for example, sorry, producing their own chips, right? They have the M1 and the M2 because they looked at the value chain, they were like, hey, wait a minute, instead of paying a ton of capex to another company, we can ourselves become a chip maker and then we also become a capex receiver to others in this value chain.
00:41:18.679 - 00:42:25.539, Speaker A: So then the next step I think is sort of vertical integration in that value chain. And that's really about financial engineering, it's about fine tuning costs. And so once you start to understand that, then the question is, okay, what type of markets are going to emerge as a result of the need to control costs and to reduce some of the volatility that arises from sort of these abnormalities in supply and demand, right? Because you can't really predict on aggregate, we now have capital markets, right, that allow you, using equities and other sort of instruments to try to take a directional view and express sentiment on where different components of this value chain are going. But within these value chains as well, what I think crypto is doing, particularly within the compute value chain, is we're taking all of these layers, we're unbundling them and turning them into commodified assets of their own that can be traded on chain. So step one for me is value chain, right? And the oil and gas industry is all about value chain. You have upstream, which is exploration production. You have midstream, which is gathering, processing.
00:42:25.539 - 00:42:58.815, Speaker A: You have downstream, which is refining, retailing. Then you have the chemicals industry, which is a derivative of that, but you have this value chain. And most of the oil majors operate sort of the seven Sisters, as they're called, they operate within that value chain. And the financial engineering that happens, happens within a value chain. So I think that's really important for cryptos. While you look at block space, right? How does block space get produced? Well, in Bitcoin, it's a very similar process. People buy Asics, they have to rack the ASICs, they have to electrify the Bitcoin mining operation.
00:42:58.815 - 00:43:39.127, Speaker A: It's a very similar value chain. And then within that value chain, you start understanding, okay, who has leverage, who doesn't, who's a net payer, who's a net receiver, who can extract more leverage through financial engineering. So I think once you start thinking through value chains, kind of mapping them out in your brain or on paper. I like paper. Then you start to really understand, like, what are these unique levers, what are these unique opportunities to extract more value through financial engineering? Which is interesting, right? That's where new markets get created. So that's step one for me. Then step two is, I think we go through this cycle always of aggregation and disaggregation.
00:43:39.127 - 00:43:40.031, Speaker A: Right.
00:43:40.223 - 00:43:51.927, Speaker B: I think it's like the famous Craigslist. You go through Craigslist and you can like assign a company to like, each section within Craigslist.
00:43:52.111 - 00:43:54.295, Speaker A: Oh, I haven't seen that, but I like that.
00:43:54.415 - 00:43:54.903, Speaker B: It's.
00:43:54.999 - 00:43:56.799, Speaker A: I've seen the bank homepage one.
00:43:56.887 - 00:44:03.515, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah, I think Solana did that one at the last break point where they kind of pull things out. But yes, Sorry to interrupt.
00:44:03.595 - 00:44:36.681, Speaker A: Similar. Whereas, like, you know, you used to go to a bank and they'd have retail banking, commercial banking, etc. Treasury management, trading. And then you see like all of the different fintechs that have taken each different service that's provided and made it a standalone business. Now what you're seeing, right, in the fintech space is consolidation. Similarly, I think in all value chains you see that, right? You see aggregation, integration, and then people look at the integration, there's inefficiencies, whether they're technical, inefficiencies whether they're operational inefficiencies or financial inefficiencies. Right.
00:44:36.681 - 00:45:05.243, Speaker A: Again, using those three levers, people start to unbundle and peel those layers apart. Right? So we saw this in compute. You used to have to run your own compute. So bare metal on Prem, very CapEx intensive, very OpEx intensive. Really made it challenging to run a compute intensive business. Then you saw the emergence of cloud computing, which was zero capex low opex to start. I also think AWS startup credits is the most brilliant idea ever from a marketing customer acquisition perspective.
00:45:05.243 - 00:45:24.019, Speaker A: And if I were starting a company selling compute today, I would have a startup program because you lock people into your infrastructure and then they're kind of trapped there. And AWS does a great job at that because your bill starts so low and then you start getting five, six figure monthly bills and you're like, well fuck, I guess I'm stuck here.
00:45:24.107 - 00:45:26.375, Speaker B: It was a brilliant 0 to 1.
00:45:26.735 - 00:45:49.535, Speaker A: Absolutely. So and then you start, I think, see, you know, seeing the emergence of cloud compute now what we're seeing is people are sort of asking themselves like, does this make sense? Because the costs are starting to get so high and also the hyperscalers have so much leverage. You're buying compute from them, you're buying managed services from them. Like all of your infrastructure is dependent on this one player and you're looking at your bills.
00:45:49.655 - 00:45:49.863, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:49.879 - 00:45:58.833, Speaker A: The question I always ask myself is like, if you're investing in something, how much of that money is going to AWS should just buy Amazon stock? Good question.
00:45:58.969 - 00:46:05.369, Speaker B: I think that was the joke within the last decade. You should have just bought Facebook, Google.
00:46:05.417 - 00:46:08.337, Speaker A: Amazon, the Mag 7 as a group.
00:46:08.361 - 00:46:09.265, Speaker B: It would have outperformed.
00:46:09.345 - 00:47:17.365, Speaker A: And then I think what we're seeing now, the next evolution, which goes back to your comment about composability and modularity is you're starting to see in particular, this is where I think crypto becomes really interesting in sort of the innovations within the broader blockchain space, right? Is you start to see people unbundling these hyperscaler, these cloud compute players and saying, okay, well we can provide compute through this distributed network where the capex is. Suddenly you have capex owners, right? They are not necessarily utilizing this capex in an effective way. That is these semiconductors that they have, they may or may not already be racked in a data center. How do we allow them to leverage these capex assets they have? Well, that's where distributed compute started to merge, right? There's a ton of new companies that are sort of data center operators that there's a lot of compute coming online right now, not all of it's being utilized. If you have spare capacity, you can contribute it to one of these networks and you can earn revenue. So you have that being unbundled sort of at the capex layer. Then at the infrastructure layer, right.
00:47:17.365 - 00:48:25.817, Speaker A: We see the rise of cloud hosting, cloud mining, that becoming more optimized. You see aggregation of disparate smaller players into these larger networks that can do some of these higher requirement like some of these more intensive jobs. Then you see the next layer. You see this really cool orchestration optimization layer that allows people to fine tune and sort of manage their infra in the same way they might experience it through one of these hyperscalers where they can abstract out some of the complexities of trying to manage how do I procure compute across seven different networks and deal with these tokens? Well, I don't. I have this orchestration layer, this control plane that I can use. And then on the back end you have all this interesting new financial engineering that can happen. So now we're seeing this interesting unbundling and I think if you combine these three trends of depin defi RWAs, you start to arrive at a different way that you can construct the compute value chain that performs the same function, is architected quite differently and has fundamentally different underlying financial engineering.
00:48:25.817 - 00:48:49.631, Speaker A: It's not going to work in every instance. Right. Some types of compute require that centralization and that scale. But the kind of the compute economy is only growing and as it continues to grow, I think we're going to see the emergence of applications and use cases that can leverage that net new sort of model for how that value chain gets constructed. Does that make sense?
00:48:49.743 - 00:48:50.247, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:50.351 - 00:48:51.035, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:54.015 - 00:49:17.485, Speaker B: I think it's very interesting just how all the pieces came together. You have blockchains which are taking these databases and collapsing them into kind of one giant database allowing you to do global coordination, remove friction and ultimately that enables new efficiencies.
00:49:17.865 - 00:49:55.345, Speaker A: And you just said one of my favorite words. So this idea of global coordination. So I just want to sort of bring it full circle. One of the things we talk about a lot with crypto and I'll be very candid, I've done a lot of soul searching over the last few years, in particular post FTX was a really dark time, I think for a lot of people, myself included. And I felt frustrated and I think that's still, that's a persistent trend. Right. I think people do feel sort of frustrated.
00:49:55.345 - 00:50:50.895, Speaker A: And what I Think about now and why, like, I'm so excited and I feel very energized is I think there's this, this new opportunity that has become really clear to me, which is why I wanted to build Crucible. So, like, this is what I need to do with the next, like, two decades of my life, if not longer. It's this idea, okay? At the end of the day, the only thing that matters to human existence is our ability to utilize energy and matter more efficiently, right? Because those are the only two things in the universe that are finite and they're like, foundational to human existence. So we need energy. We need matter. Even the rise of the AI economy is going to be fueled by energy and matter. In particular the matter that goes into making semiconductors.
00:50:50.895 - 00:52:00.351, Speaker A: Okay? So if I know those things are true, which they are true based on the laws of physics, it's like irrefutable evidence that's not going to change. I know those things are true. If I think through all of the things I just articulated around the compute value chain, the evolution of the compute value chain, I think where we now all see the world is headed is the rise of the compute economy. If I know all of those things to be true, then in my view, the most important use case for blockchains and tokens is to find, fund, facilitate how we utilize energy and matter and make it tradable how we facilitate new types of financial engineering around these two foundational inputs to the future of humanity. It's so simple at its core. And then that's the directional heading. I don't know what I'm doing ever.
00:52:00.351 - 00:52:27.865, Speaker A: I'm not a person who has plans, but I've always had a directional heading. With dcg, it was Bitcoin is going to be a massive asset class. With Coinshares, it was crypto is going to become financialized. With Crucible, it's energy and matter are the foundational building blocks of humanity. And we need to use blockchains and tokens to coordinate how we utilize these resources.
00:52:28.025 - 00:52:28.753, Speaker B: I love it.
00:52:28.849 - 00:53:11.745, Speaker A: And then now we need to just figure out, like, what does that mean? And I have some on my website. I have like four initial categories I'm thinking about, but I think that's exciting. And working with founders who are sort of at the early stages and thinking about, okay, how do we actually build these markets? How do we actually deconstruct this compute value chain? What does that look like? How do we build new tools that allow us to better financially engineer around this compute value chain? Like, that's a very fun and very weird journey. And I'm going to get it wrong 30, 40, 50% of the time, but I know I'm going to get it fucking right. And when I do. Let's go. You only need to be right a few times, but I know the directional heading is correct.
00:53:11.745 - 00:53:12.725, Speaker A: It's inevitable.
00:53:13.105 - 00:53:13.809, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:13.937 - 00:53:15.857, Speaker A: I don't know. What do you think? I guess. How do you react?
00:53:15.961 - 00:53:26.525, Speaker B: No, to me again, one of the things that I really appreciate is kind of going back, I know you don't like first principles, but to the fundamental physics.
00:53:27.945 - 00:53:30.765, Speaker A: Do you know why I don't like first principles? I don't know what it means.
00:53:31.465 - 00:53:34.641, Speaker B: I think you're doing first principles. You're just not saying it's first principles.
00:53:34.793 - 00:53:43.155, Speaker A: I just like there's. I feel like there's all these words people you like, thesis driven first principles, zero to one. And I'm like, whatever. Okay. So I have to.
00:53:43.575 - 00:54:44.619, Speaker B: Physics is how you make sense of the world. And while I was at Tesla, it was always physics is the law, everything else is recommendation. And so for me, I mean, in starting Frictionless, what I felt like I realized was that these blockchains are coordination systems. And one of the core coordinations of making these systems actually highly performant was communicating those bytes around the globe. And the true way to actually express that is just increasing bandwidth to communicate more bytes throughout the ecosystem, to connect these heterogeneous databases and to share that information globally. And I think with Crucible and what you're doing is ultimately going back to the basics, articulating that and making that the North Star. And with that heading, again, nobody really knows what they're doing.
00:54:44.619 - 00:54:58.735, Speaker B: We're all trying to, I would say, understand the basics enough that allow us to say, I don't know how this is going to unfold in the short to medium term, but long term, I know this will happen.
00:54:59.285 - 00:55:49.055, Speaker A: I think the other pieces, and one of the questions I do get asked is, well, why not just keep angel investing, right? Like if. Why do you need a firm? I think the other piece is storytelling is so important. And that's why I always like to joke, you know, I'm an aspiring cult leader, but I do think it's very true. One of the really unique things about Venture, which I really like is there is a serendipitous component to it, right? There is a sort of fundamentals driven, very technical component to it, but there is also a component of storytelling and culture building and narrative creation that's really foundational and you have to kind of have all three.
00:55:50.755 - 00:55:51.475, Speaker B: I think.
00:55:51.595 - 00:56:02.525, Speaker A: And that's why I think having a firm like crucible, like the branding is unhinged. We're going full on religious overtones. You know, my homepage is Jesus Christ in a motherboard.
00:56:03.145 - 00:56:04.689, Speaker B: You have to be a cult leader.
00:56:04.857 - 00:56:53.383, Speaker A: But I think it's so important to come from a place of deep conviction and to also work with founders who are capable of inspiring deep conviction and creating narratives, creating lore. If you look at crypto, right, Crypto is a full on religious experience. We are at our religious conclave, you know, here in Korea, Korea Blockchain week. But it's like a papal conclave. We get together, you know, record podcasts. Yeah, we're doing our rituals. I think it's really interesting, but I do think it's so important and having a firm to be able to tell those stories, to anchor around, to sort of unify the narrative, the experience, and just have a larger sort of arc or like umbrella things can fall under.
00:56:53.383 - 00:56:58.839, Speaker A: And it's really fun and I know how to do that. So I'm orienting around that.
00:56:58.967 - 00:57:21.107, Speaker B: Again, I think you're a great storyteller and I think that that is one of the hard things that I think engineers typically get wrong, is that yes, technical details can be important, but they're only important in the fact that it relates back to a product that's actually meaningful. And then you have to tell that product story to the world.
00:57:21.291 - 00:58:05.847, Speaker A: That is the biggest challenge. I frankly see there are a lot of really brilliant people that I have the privilege of interacting with and you do as well. I think being an early stage investor is it truly is like a privilege to get to work with brilliant, brilliant people. But the issue we have is there's so many people I interact with who talk to me about what they're building and they're brilliant and it's technically brilliant, but they have zero ability to create a story. They have no ability to sort of create attention. And that's really difficult because it's never the best technology that wins. It's the best marketed technology that wins.
00:58:05.847 - 00:58:34.085, Speaker A: And I know that's controversial, but I think it's fundamentally true. And I think in crypto we over index on quote, unquote technical. We need to index more around. The ability to create community, to create movements, to create traction like that is really important. So what I want to see in a founder is the ability to build that cult of belief, to build that community. And that requires a lot of courage, by the way.
00:58:34.865 - 00:58:53.541, Speaker B: And that actually is a great point. Because what I've learned, and especially with investing, you're not always going to be popular. And it takes a lot of courage to stand up and say, I'm going this way. Even if everybody else says, you're dumb, that's the best.
00:58:53.613 - 00:58:58.069, Speaker A: When people call you dumb, I want people to think I'm an idiot. That's good.
00:58:58.157 - 00:59:30.365, Speaker B: I always appreciate when people say I'm dumb and can, like, point out flaws in your logic. You want to learn. But I think if you have conviction in what you're doing, you've gone to the basics and say, I still believe the world is going this way, and I still believe you're wrong. I think it makes you continuously re underwrite your thesis. But it still takes courage to stand up and say, I'm still going this direction. And I've seen the best people continuously do this time and time again. And it is a muscle that you need to flex.
00:59:30.365 - 00:59:32.725, Speaker B: It is difficult, though.
00:59:33.465 - 01:00:01.227, Speaker A: But I think it's. That is where growth happens. And I think what has been so interesting to me, I've gone. I've been doing this for almost a decade, like I said, and I've gone through phases, right? I don't ever want to be a main character. I think there's zero roi in being the main character. But you want to be like a side character that pops up a couple of times in the season. Everyone's like, oh, yeah, I like that character, or, oh, I hate that character.
01:00:01.227 - 01:00:18.931, Speaker A: It doesn't matter, as long as they feel something. And I think the. The most offensive thing or the worst thing is indifference, right? Love and hate are the same. They're two sides of the same thing. But I think in today's world, you have to make people feel something. I don't care if people like me or not. That's fine.
01:00:18.931 - 01:00:43.863, Speaker A: I'm not for everyone. But I want to make you feel something. I don't care if you agree with me or disagree with me, but if you feel something, then that's good. That means I'm doing something right? If you have a visceral reaction, that's good. That's why storytelling is important. That's why you have to put yourself out there. Because you could be doing brilliant, great things, but if nobody knows, who's going to know? And the worst is just being like.
01:00:43.863 - 01:00:53.395, Speaker A: Just kind of being there. And I feel like in crypto right now, there are a lot of people who. They're just kind of there. And I'm like, I don't understand why this needs to be articulated.
01:00:53.855 - 01:01:23.595, Speaker B: I Think the other thing is you, whether love or hate, you still have to be your own biggest cheerleader. And the fact that if you don't put yourself out there, if you aren't, if you're too afraid to take the risk, to be criticized, then the indifference will be there because you won't be relevant because you never put your hand up and said, I believe such and such.
01:01:24.125 - 01:01:36.385, Speaker A: I think. And that's where like, there's so many different elements that go into creating a brand and Persona. Riz is really important. Wear a sick fit.
01:01:37.085 - 01:01:38.381, Speaker B: Founders that have swag.
01:01:38.493 - 01:01:55.431, Speaker A: Yeah, ice yourself out a little bit. Go wear a sick fit. You know, whatever it is, like, do be memorable, just kind of be weird. And it is hard. I'm putting myself out there every day, whatever. But it gets easier as you do it more though. But you just have to keep doing it.
01:01:55.543 - 01:02:06.915, Speaker B: Maybe relating it back to the beginning of the podcast again, though, you've done it with, I would say, grace in the terms of playing the long term game. And I think that is, I hope so you do.
01:02:08.335 - 01:02:09.247, Speaker A: Time will tell.
01:02:09.351 - 01:02:50.941, Speaker B: I think you wouldn't have been in the industry for as long as you have if you were playing the short term games. And especially again, where there's a lot of perverse incentives, you can take shortcuts. It's hard to continue to think about what game do I want to play the long term game so that I can continue to play the game. And I've seen time and time again people try to take shortcuts and they screw themselves. Because as we kind of alluded to, this entire industry has been one of the highest growing industries in the entire world. And. And the worst thing that you can do is take yourself out of a game that is compounding at such a high growth rate.
01:02:51.093 - 01:03:33.287, Speaker A: Well, and I like that you're referencing James Carse, may he rest in peace, who wrote the book Finite and Infinite Games. And I think I've always, I've never really thought of it in that way, but when I read the book maybe six years ago, I was like, oh, I understand now. Because you play one game, you learn, then you figure out there's another game, like a meta game and another game and there's this larger metagame. And as you articulated, the only thing I really want and what I've learned about myself is people are motivated by different things, right? People are. Some people are motivated by money, some people are motivated by fame, other people are motivated by power. Maybe it's a combination of those things. I think I.
01:03:33.287 - 01:04:00.219, Speaker A: What I have learned about myself is I do like all of those things, right? Like, money is nice to have because it makes your life easier. Power is nice to have because it allows you to get things done. And it also makes life easier. Fame, I don't know how you saw it. It is. And then I think the other one that doesn't get talked about a lot is knowledge, right? Like, I like knowing things. I was the kid.
01:04:00.219 - 01:04:52.919, Speaker A: Like, I wanted an Encyclopedia Britannica set for my birthday and I got in trouble because I would stay up till three in the morning on school nights reading encyclopedias under the covers. This was pre Internet, right? That's who I was. And I think what I've learned is I want to build businesses that are successful, of course, and I want to be a successful investor, but I don't want to do that because, like, I want to buy stuff or have more numbers in my bank account. That's how, like, I get off on it. Like, I like it because I'm learning and I feel like I tried to not work for a bit, right? I was like, oh, maybe I'm just going to like, take a step back, take a year or two off. I couldn't do it because my brain is just like. And then I started getting a lot of hobbies that were really just not productive hobbies.
01:04:52.919 - 01:05:16.493, Speaker A: They involved a lot of gear. I was like, okay, I need to stop. I need to stop. This is not good. And I think once you figure out what excites you, what motivates you, then it's how do you keep playing? Who do you want to play with? Right? I've done a lot of thinking lately. That's why I'm not going to, you know, all of these crypto conferences anymore. I don't need to play with the people that I've been playing with for the last nine years.
01:05:16.493 - 01:05:43.953, Speaker A: I know how that game goes. I want to go find new people to play with. Commodities traders, market makers, natural resource owners, data center owners. I want to go play with some new people, bring them into the game, right? Or figure out what game they're playing and see how I can play it too. So I think, what game do you want to play? What? Who do you want to play it with and how, right? If it's not fun, I'm not doing it.
01:05:44.129 - 01:05:58.257, Speaker B: I love it. No, I think, yeah, what you said, the game always changes and it's important. I think most people don't even understand the game that they're playing. Generally. They kind of like, I didn't for.
01:05:58.281 - 01:06:00.145, Speaker A: A Long time I had no fucking clue what I was.
01:06:00.185 - 01:06:34.305, Speaker B: I still don't you have an understanding of, at least directionally, what game you're playing. The game can change, but I would say most people are not even aware of the game. And that awareness kind of allows you to kind of as an onion, just continue to peel back different layers. And I think as a venture investor it is really interesting because you get to see all the different games and continue to learn, which is really cool. Really, really cool. Especially within an industry that's growing as quickly. But maybe as we're kind of like putting a bow on it and wrapping it back.
01:06:34.305 - 01:06:49.765, Speaker B: I'm very curious. You're now starting Crucible. You're at the beginning of that journey. What is maybe like the call to action for founders? What are you looking to do in the next six months, year? How are you continuing to kind of think about this?
01:06:49.805 - 01:07:38.461, Speaker A: My DMS are open. I want to talk to anyone and everyone who's thinking about compute energy and building new markets, new financial engineering, new tooling layers. Yeah, that's interesting to me. What else? I think the other thing I'm focused on, it's not an immediate next six months, but sort of longer term. I think venture is a very blunt instrument. And so one of the things that I learned at DCG and at Coinshares is how do you work and in my priorities career is how do you work across the capital structure. So obviously there's venture finance, but there's also credit which I think is increasingly important in a high interest rate environment.
01:07:38.461 - 01:08:17.959, Speaker A: Right. There's a lot more appetite for credit now and also in capex intensive industries. And I think we are going through really capex intensive phase for just growth generally. There's a huge credit opportunity that I'm interested in, excited about exploring actively. I think there's also somebody's going to build like the Mercuria of digital commodities. They're going to build a firm that hedges out risk for consumers and producers of digital commodities in sort of a programmatic way where people can outsource that because not everybody is going to be able to do that. Right.
01:08:17.959 - 01:08:39.128, Speaker A: So Mercuria is one of these firms in the traditional sort of natural resources world that you would call could help hedge out some of that for you. And there's other firms like that. Right. Some of them do prop, but these folks do it for people who are either consumers or producers of. And so I'm really interested in that as well. Either working with someone to build it, Building it. Within Crucible Incubating.
01:08:39.128 - 01:08:45.724, Speaker A: It. But I think that's going to be really interesting opportunity as well. Yeah. New type of. New type of market participant.
01:08:46.144 - 01:08:46.592, Speaker B: Cool.
01:08:46.648 - 01:08:47.928, Speaker A: I don't know. It's fun.
01:08:48.016 - 01:08:51.276, Speaker B: It is. Continuing to iterate on the games that we play.
01:08:51.440 - 01:09:11.556, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, again, I do think we're entering a new era. There's nothing new under the sun. We've done this before. We're going to do it again and again, and I don't know. It's fun. I'm enjoying where I am right now because I'm doing something new.
01:09:11.556 - 01:09:14.664, Speaker A: It's scary. It's really scary putting myself out there.
01:09:15.044 - 01:09:19.364, Speaker B: Starting a firm is the same in my mind as starting a new company.
01:09:19.484 - 01:09:20.609, Speaker A: LPs are tough.
01:09:20.686 - 01:09:25.385, Speaker B: LPs are tough. I mean, you take a lot of risks. I would say I'm a solo gp.
01:09:25.425 - 01:09:37.393, Speaker A: Right. Like you have a partner. I don't. I have my solo gp. So it's me versus my own thoughts, which is a lot. You have to really have conviction. Right?
01:09:37.489 - 01:10:05.386, Speaker B: Yeah. No, Well, I. I think the world will really enjoy this conversation. I think your point of view, especially on the crypto markets, given your background, is unique from a lot of other managers, technical people that I talk to, and I'm very excited to see how you continue to do because I am very much an admirer of going back to the basics, and I think we're.
01:10:05.410 - 01:10:06.882, Speaker A: Going to do some deals together, Logan.
01:10:06.938 - 01:10:27.649, Speaker B: We will. We will, I'm sure. But going back to the basics, I think that gives you the cornerstone to allow you to say, as a solo gp, I'm moving in this direction because I've done the homework and I think there's not very many people that can actually continue to ask the questions that allow them to get to the bedrock.
01:10:27.737 - 01:10:52.005, Speaker A: Yeah. And then the last thing I'll say is just looking at the crypto landscape as a whole, I do think, and I'm excited about a new era of managers that is emerging. There are certainly firms that have done really well in crypto and I think will continue to do well, but they're really big. Right. And I think there is a new generation of emerging managers. Right. Including you.
01:10:52.005 - 01:11:09.969, Speaker A: I'm a big fan of some other emerging gps. I love chatting with them because they have very opinionated views of the world. They're not generalist firms. Right. They're very opinionated. They're very exacting. They're very deliberate, aggressive, and I'm excited.
01:11:09.969 - 01:11:24.115, Speaker A: I think the crypto venture landscape has sort of been filled with generalist firms, people who overindex Anno. We do technical. I'm like, shut the f. I don't want to hear about the. Okay, great. Like, good for you. I'm so happy for you.
01:11:24.115 - 01:11:54.045, Speaker A: No, let's do something different because at the end of the day, what we're going to get is just a proliferation of more block space. Let's create demand for that block space and utilize it in a way where we create effective, persistent, fee paying markets for said block space. And so I think there's this whole new generation of managers. I'm excited about it. I'm also, you know, seating managers. I've seated a lot of emerging managers over the years. I love investing in other people's firms.
01:11:54.045 - 01:12:15.415, Speaker A: A lot of people have, you know, who I've worked with over the years have been a part of the Crucible journey. So I think it's exciting to see, I think it's important. And so I'm really looking forward to seeing this new generation of managers sort of rethinking, reshaping the crypto investing landscape and maybe moving beyond some of the games we've seen to date.
01:12:16.475 - 01:12:25.295, Speaker B: Maybe we can end it on understand what games you're playing. Play the long term game and.
01:12:27.355 - 01:12:29.835, Speaker A: You can never escape the laws of thermodynamics.
01:12:29.955 - 01:12:33.211, Speaker B: You can never be physics. Cool. Well, we'll end it on that. Maltem.
01:12:33.243 - 01:12:34.095, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
01:12:35.275 - 01:12:35.835, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
