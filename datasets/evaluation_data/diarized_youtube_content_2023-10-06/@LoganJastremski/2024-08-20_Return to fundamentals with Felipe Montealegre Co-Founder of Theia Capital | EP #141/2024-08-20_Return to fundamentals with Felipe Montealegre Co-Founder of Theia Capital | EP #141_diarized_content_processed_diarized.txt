00:00:00.160 - 00:00:54.510, Speaker A: Fund thesis really comes from my background and John, my co founder's background. We both worked in private equity. I worked in mid market private equity buying up companies in the US, and John worked in real estate, private equity. But both of those jobs, especially in the mid market, are based on cash flows of companies, because you're not buying a stock that you can sell in three or six months. And you can't really play a narrative if you're planning to own something for five to ten years. So the whole job becomes about predicting cash flows, predicting kind of main drivers, and thinking about, you know, what do I get for holding this asset? And when we came into the industry, we realized that that was not the prevailing mental model at all for investments. It was really a kind of a greater fool model, where you say, I'm buying this because I think there is some narrative that's going to double or triple it over the next six months and someone else will buy it.
00:00:54.510 - 00:01:10.570, Speaker A: But why are they buying it? To sell it to somebody else. To sell it to somebody else. And there's no kind of end to that chain. So, you know, one of the things that you really do on this podcast is talk about first principles constantly. Our view is first principles are for an asset are, what do you get for holding it?
00:01:10.650 - 00:01:10.890, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:10.930 - 00:01:28.270, Speaker A: You're. You're trading uS dollars that you can pay rent with for an asset. Does that. Is that because you think you can sell somebody else, or is that because that asset will give you cash flows over time that are more than worth the trade? And we think the latter ends up winning over a long period of time.
00:01:33.890 - 00:01:36.490, Speaker B: Felipe, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.
00:01:36.610 - 00:01:37.642, Speaker A: Thank you for having me on.
00:01:37.746 - 00:01:38.330, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
00:01:38.370 - 00:01:41.234, Speaker A: This is my favorite podcast, so it's good to be here.
00:01:41.322 - 00:01:49.456, Speaker B: No, thank you. I appreciate the kind words. Excited to do this in New York, running around the city. I'm sweating a little bit, but all part of the New York lifestyle.
00:01:49.538 - 00:01:52.748, Speaker A: It's been the hottest day of the year. I think it's.
00:01:52.924 - 00:02:05.788, Speaker B: It's good, though. I. I'm. I'm really excited for a Stanford, uh, blockchain conference. It's one of my favorite. I was a little sad it wasn't in Palo Alto, but I don't know if you had to pick any other city. New York's a great place to host it.
00:02:05.884 - 00:02:23.022, Speaker A: It's, uh, it'll be my first time, but it's nice to have it nearby. And Columbia's a good venue, too. I went to, uh, Tldr, the defi conference there. Yeah, it's just a nice place where everyone can meet up outside. It's a good blend of attending the conferences and also just meeting people that you haven't seen in a while.
00:02:23.086 - 00:03:10.824, Speaker B: Nice. No, I'm definitely looking forward to it. We're early in the week and so should make for a great venue. But I wanted to have you on the podcast and have kind of gotten to learn a little bit about you, your fund and your background. And I really admire what you're doing because I think ultimately where the blockchain industry is going to be headed, in my opinion, is focusing on applications at scale that make money. And I think you started your firm really ahead of this thesis, predicting kind of like the early days of the Internet. A lot of it was speculative, but as the industry matured, these are businesses that make money.
00:03:10.824 - 00:03:21.316, Speaker B: And so maybe before diving deeper into your fund and everything, how did you get here and how'd you like get into the blockchain industry?
00:03:21.428 - 00:04:01.850, Speaker A: Yeah. And the fun thesis really comes from my background and John, my co founder's background. We both worked in private equity. I worked in mid market private equity buying up companies in the US, and John worked in real estate, private equity. But both of those jobs, especially in the mid market, are based on cash flows of companies, because you're not buying a stock that you can sell in three or six months. And you can't really play a narrative if you're planning to own something for five to ten years. So the whole job becomes about predicting cash flows, predicting main drivers, and thinking about what do I get for holding this asset? That's really how I grew up, thinking about investing.
00:04:01.850 - 00:04:31.222, Speaker A: And when we came into the industry, we realized that that was not the prevailing mental model at all for investments. It was really a kind of a greater fool model where you say, I'm buying this because I think there is some narrative that's going to double or triple it over the next six months and someone else will buy it. But why are they buying it? To sell it to somebody else. To sell it to somebody else. And there's no kind of end to that chain. So, you know, one of the things that you really do on this podcast is talk about first principles. Constantly.
00:04:31.222 - 00:05:33.880, Speaker A: Our view is first principles for an asset are what do you get for holding it? You're trading us dollars that you can pay rent with for an asset. Is that because you think you can sell to somebody else, or is that because that asset will give you cash flows over time that are more than worth the trade? And we think the latter ends up winning over a long period of time, but, yeah, so my background's in private equity. I was doing financial institutions, industrials, healthcare, mid market buyouts. Before that, I studied economics, and then in 2020, I was working at a firm that was doing a few deals in the space and before an investment committee over the weekend, I started reading up on paxos, actually. So declaration partners, they were in the early Paxos round, and I started reading the papers on the space, learning about Defi, learning about the vision, and was kind of immediately sold. So within a year of that, we were talking about starting up the fund without a lot of knowledge, but with high hopes.
00:05:34.820 - 00:05:44.892, Speaker B: I think that's probably how most funds start initially. And when did the fund actually get off the ground? Was it 2022? 2023.
00:05:44.956 - 00:06:09.446, Speaker A: So January 1 22. We started with friends and family capital, and it was a little bit of a beta fund. We were trying to figure out who we were in the industry. We really didn't know. We weren't native. And I think there's a lot of pitfalls that come from. I like to talk about the benefits of tradfi, but if you come in with only a tradfi hat, you will get smoked in this industry, because you don't know what numbers are real, you don't know what concepts mean.
00:06:09.446 - 00:06:20.190, Speaker A: They're all kind of hard concepts, and you're not used to the pace of the industry. So we spent a year figuring things out, moving pretty slowly, and then opened up to outside capital. January 23.
00:06:20.310 - 00:06:24.878, Speaker B: Nice. That was a turbulent time in 2022.
00:06:24.974 - 00:06:27.066, Speaker A: Yeah, it was interesting time to start.
00:06:27.158 - 00:06:40.490, Speaker B: Yeah, same for us. I think there was a lot of learning lessons, and I think within the industry, you kind of have to pay your dues, so to speak, just to get to the starting line. And the price to play the game.
00:06:40.610 - 00:06:45.490, Speaker A: The price to play the game is a lot of volatility, but, you know, you can speed run it on a year like 22, I think.
00:06:45.570 - 00:07:17.830, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So the fund got started in 2022, really focused on the first principles of, hey, this industry will eventually scale. There will be material applications, products, services that are ultimately created within the industry, and we are going to do a first principles, fundamental analysis, and we are going to buy and own those assets in the fund instead of pure speculation on the kind of like the opposite side of meme coins.
00:07:18.530 - 00:07:40.586, Speaker A: Yeah, although I like meme coins for another reason. We can get into that. But the opposite side of meme coins, exactly the opposite side of narrative. Tokens. Tokens where it's all about the narrative and how exciting that is to people. And we saw something like that happen after 2001. So that's a period we studied a lot in tech where valuations were priced to eyeballs.
00:07:40.586 - 00:08:14.838, Speaker A: They were priced at clicks and you had these monstrous valuations for Yahoo pets.com, and the industry just fell apart, as everyone knows, in 2001. But there are multiple attempts at bringing those valuations back. The investor base didn't just pack up and leave the day after the bubble burst. They kept on trying to invest the way that they had and that made them so much money from 1999 to 2001. And it just was always a kind of a bear market rally for those valuation metrics. And the thing to do at that point was to focus on who's building a real product here that can build massive cash flows.
00:08:14.838 - 00:09:03.066, Speaker A: And people who did that focused on Apple, Google, Amazon, and kind of went on to have some of the best investment returns ever. And I think that the foundation of that is a belief in the industry. So we come back to this all the time. If you think, and we do, that, the industry will take on kind of centralized finance. We're at less than a basis point of centralized finance right now. And if you think that over 2030 years, pick a time horizon, you can get to 70% or more, which we do, then there's almost nothing you should be doing other than spending your time thinking about basic principles, fundamentals, and looking for people building for that kind of outcome. Because nothing has more, you know, nothing has more cash than the financial sector.
00:09:03.066 - 00:09:09.022, Speaker A: And if you can really get ahead of that, there should be a lot of apples and Googles and Amazons in our industry too.
00:09:09.166 - 00:09:52.860, Speaker B: I fully agree. And I think whether you're a builder or an allocator, this is probably the highest leverage place that you can spend your time just focusing on it. Because if you can understand the nuances, how the applications ultimately come together, to your point, it's such a small fraction of what it, what we think it will become. And if it actually does kind of digitize the current financial system, there's tremendous amounts of upside. And we're really at the precipice. We always say that things haven't just started. But I truly do feel like that if you look at user metrics, if you look at on chain metrics, they're starting.
00:09:52.860 - 00:11:00.822, Speaker B: And I think a lot of that has really been focused on infrastructure in the past correctly. But now I feel like infrastructure is getting to the point where you can actually start to build applications and those applications don't have to worry about as much on the infrastructure itself. So maybe my question to you is, I think like the.com kind of boom and bus, everybody wants valuations to be high, at least on the venture side, so that their venture books are marked up, their limited partners feel happy, and they can ultimately sell and go raise another venture fund. But on the flip side, everybody wants to kind of have fundamentals analysis so that they can value these things. And you get the tradfi kind of traditional capital allocators to come in and kind of grow the pie, so to speak. And so there's this weird kind of dynamics today where, like, valuations generally are so high across the board on of a fundamentals point of view, but people want them to be high and don't really want the music to stop.
00:11:00.822 - 00:11:09.254, Speaker B: How are you kind of thinking of this when you're either allocating or how the space shake shakes out in the next twelve to 24 months?
00:11:09.302 - 00:11:52.900, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's like two groups there in your attention, right? One is builders. And I think for builders, you're just encountering the normal kind of revenue conundrum that every company has. You want valuation to be high, you think it's ultimately based on revenue. Go get more customers, earn more revenue. Revenue at the end of the day is what your customers are willing to get back to you from the value you created for them, so that it should be fully aligned on the builder side. If you can think out 3510 years ahead, and you've seen some of the best builders over time, think about customers and revenue as their North Star, then there is a group of investors who want to make money quickly, raise a new fund. And I think it's hard to do that because revenues take time and fundamentals take time.
00:11:52.900 - 00:12:52.276, Speaker A: I think back to one of my favorite lines in a value investing book by Seth Klarman, where he says at the end he goes, this won't make you get rich quick, but maybe you can get rich slowly. I think that's our mental model for investing in these markets. If you're making, I mean, these returns can still be way above the cost of capital and way above what people are making in traditional markets. It just might not be 1000% in a year if you're trying to do fundamental based investing, and it might still be right once you get up the s curve. But I think the shift, the focus on narrative has been because of precisely the tension that you described where people are trying to make return the fund in a single year, go raise fund two, it's a little bit of a distorted view of what's reasonable in fun land. And I think it comes from how many people did earn those amounts of wealth in 2017 and 2020. If you're still here, you saw it happen twice, you're thinking, I can do it again, but maybe you can't do it again.
00:12:52.276 - 00:12:54.360, Speaker A: Maybe you have to think a little bit longer term.
00:12:54.740 - 00:13:22.592, Speaker B: Yeah. I guess when you're thinking about this space, you're not really looking at the assets that have the higher valuations. It's the teams that have either done a token and are starting to kind of have a more mature product or at least some types of cash flows where it's able to justify evaluation long term, I guess, so to speak.
00:13:22.616 - 00:13:53.462, Speaker A: Yeah. Or what we call a good faith model. So fundamentals, I think one of the kind of nuances, it doesn't have to be low price, it isn't low price earnings. Right. It's just that you're valuing something based on future cash flows. So if somebody comes with a great idea and says, I'm not going to earn any cash for five years, but over the years, five to 15, I should be able to earn tremendous amounts of cash. And it more than pays for your investment many times over, if you believe them.
00:13:53.462 - 00:14:24.824, Speaker A: That's a fundamental investment in my book. Right. So it's not, you know, I think people will often say, you know, low price of sales doesn't work well in the industry. Well, yeah, because if you're buying something that's being disrupted fully and it's going to be gone in six months, buying it at five times price to earnings doesn't mean anything. You overpaid based on fundamentals. So it's what we call a good faith model. Can you show me a model where the cash flows that come back to the token are more than what we put up, plus our cost of capital, plus some for, you know, to make it interesting.
00:14:24.824 - 00:14:28.600, Speaker A: And if you can do that and it's believable, that's. That's a fundamental investment in our view.
00:14:28.720 - 00:15:20.932, Speaker B: I like it. I do think I've been talking with more and more asset allocators that have started hedge funds or kind of underwriting digital assets now. And as we've kind of talked about, I see this shift on the horizon and everybody can kind of see this tidal wave coming. Everybody wants it to be a fundamental driven market. But then there's this long term where, at least historically, the venture capitalists don't want these marks to come down. And so I do think it's very interesting where the industry is probably going to be headed over the next twelve to 24 months. I don't know how long it's going to take for this to play out, but I kind of view it as the natural progression that will ultimately is needed for the industry to move forward.
00:15:21.076 - 00:15:35.746, Speaker A: Yeah, so do I. And it's a good time, if you, to get ahead of it, both as a fund and as a builder. Right. There are so few builders thinking this way that the competitive set is really small. If you do want to think about just building a fundamentally based good business.
00:15:35.858 - 00:16:13.988, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. Maybe shifting a little bit more. I think that maybe paints the picture for the audience of your unique point of view on where the landscape is going from the overarching blockchain side. Ultimately a return to fundamentals, which I think is warranted. And then I think it would be a little bit more interesting if we dove deeper into your funds thesis. And yes, it is fundamental driven, but everybody kind of has their circle of competence, so to speak. Can you kind of walk us through some unique areas that you're really excited about or.
00:16:14.044 - 00:16:39.230, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, we're just generally focused on what we call the Internet financial system. You know, people have different words. I don't like the word defi, people call it on chain finance. But just generally the idea of building a replacement financial system on the cloud. We think this is better for many reasons. One is the kind of global angle, right? Having seamless value flows across the world. The other is just what you can do with composability.
00:16:39.230 - 00:17:11.098, Speaker A: A lot of Solana's thesis, a lot of what you talk about really hits on that there are kind of unique financial primitives that you can create with an on chain financial system that you can't create with the analog financial system. And then there's just the idea of reducing costs, right. Every cost, except for trading, trading stocks is really efficient in traditional markets. Almost everything else can be much better. So we focus. We kind of have the view that over 20 or 30 years, that's going to really play out in a big way. And it's a complicated topic.
00:17:11.098 - 00:17:43.110, Speaker A: So we like to just spend 12 hours a day, every day, thinking about on chain finance and how it's going to develop over the long term. So that means we stay away from a lot of interesting areas. A lot of circle competence is saying no to things. So we actually stay away from deepen. Even though I think it's a great sector, we stay away from AI, even though I think it's interesting potentially in the future. But we just focus on, on chain finance. So, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things we can get into there in terms of what we see coming.
00:17:44.160 - 00:18:37.302, Speaker B: I mean, it's interesting because for me, one of the first things that really resident resonated with me on the blockchain side was that decentralized finance aspect, the fact that it is permissionless. The first world is very accustomed to many financial services that are not really as widely available in the rest of the world. And I think you kind of share that with the global finance, because not only is this giving, kind of bringing digitizing services from the financial markets, but it's making them globally available, which I think only increases kind of the market size that we originally thought as well.
00:18:37.366 - 00:19:14.550, Speaker A: Yeah, and if all, you know, I think we can do a lot more. But if all we ever do is bring the efficiency of the us system to the world, that would be a huge win worthy of all of our effort and much more. But so I actually grew up in Central America. Some stats on that, where you really see, really see the financial system fail. Banks in Central America have earned over 40% roe over 30 years. That's four x the Roe of banks in the US. And that's just a pure tax on the economy based on how few banks there are and how little competition there is between them.
00:19:14.550 - 00:19:51.508, Speaker A: 25% of the Northern Triangle's GDP, so that's Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, comes from remittances. Those remittances have 10% fees on average. So you're talking about 2.5% of GDP being taxed by a handful, literally a handful of institutions. And something that you could do on Solana sending USDC directly for a penny or a fraction, as you know better than me, a fraction of a penny. And then there's just ideas of capital formation, right? Mortgage rates are often way above the mid teens in these places. Auto loans are above often.
00:19:51.508 - 00:20:19.748, Speaker A: They've been above 40% for many years in these places. Like, you're talking about real financial inefficiencies. And if you own a business, guess what? You're never going to sell that business unless you happen to live through one of those kind of global m and a waves that happen every 20 years. That's it. Your business gets passed down to your children, but you have no liquidity. So there's all these kind of major inefficiencies blocking what's possible. And I think that's kind of what our fun thesis is.
00:20:19.748 - 00:20:29.758, Speaker A: We can do all that and kind of bring the US financial system to the rest of the world as a first as a first step, and then just make it much more efficient as a second step.
00:20:29.854 - 00:21:23.218, Speaker B: Yeah, there, there are many inefficiencies, and I think, I know I really do just get so excited about what is possible over the long term and that the technology is just kind of getting to that point. And I think when we first met and we had a dinner and we were kind of nerding out on some of the cool new technology process, and some of that was just talking about as blockchains get better, as you get faster block times, you don't reduce mev. Maybe you reduce the amount of mev per block, but it's ultimately part of the process of bringing this technology to the world is figuring out the inefficiencies in blockchains as well, and trying to mitigate those or improve upon those as much as possible.
00:21:23.274 - 00:21:55.542, Speaker A: Yeah, we were talking about the Malemi paper on block Times Mev. So we love Solana D five. For this reason, we think the block times and expenses are going to be the determining factors for on chain finance and what's possible. That paper, just to kind of rehash it, says that specifically, LVR, which comes from sex two Dex MeV, um, is reduced quadratically as block times get shorter. So you cut the block time in half, you reduce it by. By four. Uh, it's.
00:21:55.542 - 00:22:24.748, Speaker A: The prediction was that kind of l two s and Solana and fast throughput chains should have much lower Mev. And that's played out for the most part. You know, it's not perfect. Cause you have, you have, um, base fees, and that throws a little bit of wrench in it, but it's, it's played out pretty much that way. And I mean, that's a huge tax to the system, right? I like sex to Dex, arbitrage or just general Mev. In general, you know, there's no such thing as benign Mev. It's always a tax on somebody, right? It's a system that conserves, it's a conservation of energy.
00:22:24.748 - 00:23:08.190, Speaker A: There's always, if it comes from. If the ARB is making profit, it's coming from somebody. It might be wider spreads, it might be a user doesn't know they're paying for this mvv, but it's never, it's always zero sum, right? So reducing LVR by four every time you cut block times in half is a very meaningful reduction. So that's one of the things that we're excited about. You know, other things on the high throughput kind of thesis that you have on your fun and your podcast. You know, there's really interesting designs. Like, I don't know if you've ever gotten into the LP options idea.
00:23:08.190 - 00:23:32.290, Speaker A: Like you can take LP shares. LP shares are basically covered call options, right? So you're introducing this convexity into financial instruments that we just don't have on chain. On chain. We have spot and perps. Those are both, you know, in the kind of par lines, they're delta, but they're not gamma. They're straight lines, but not convexity. But you have LP shares, right? And those have this kind of convex shape.
00:23:32.290 - 00:24:07.214, Speaker A: And there's all these ideas about how to use those to make all types of any option really arbitrary options. And the idea works in theory anywhere. But immediately you see costs blow up because you're rebalancing constantly. You see costs blow up if you're paying any kind of gas fees at all. So there's just all these ideas that are really kind of only possible with composable finance, but they don't work unless you have fees down to fractions of a penny and block times down to hopefully faster than 400 milliseconds.
00:24:07.382 - 00:24:31.514, Speaker B: I think we can get there. It'll take some time. I've been excited about the general progress of the high throughput ecosystem. Solana obviously spearheading that. Some cool things going on the consensus side with Swe and aptos. We'll see what happens with Monadheendeh. It's definitely an area to keep an eye out.
00:24:31.514 - 00:24:47.010, Speaker B: So maybe staying on the topic of MEV, what are your thoughts around MeV value accrual for different blockchains? This is the prevailing narrative at the moment?
00:24:47.090 - 00:25:15.940, Speaker A: Yeah. It's two shares argument from two years ago. I think it's a brilliant argument. I was happy to see it because it's bringing things down to fundamentals and cash flow, ultimately. I don't actually think it works after thinking about it for a while now, because you are putting something that is just negative for the ecosystem at the heart of its value, and that just leads to all types of silly conclusions. I would say, for example. Sorry, go ahead.
00:25:17.200 - 00:25:34.632, Speaker B: I think you have different types of MeV, the good Mev, which is the saxdax Arbsen, and then you have like bad Mev, which is like the sandwiching attack. Do you feel like it's for the ecosystem, like trying to remove all the meV? Or.
00:25:34.736 - 00:25:36.640, Speaker A: So I would argue that there's no good Mev.
00:25:36.720 - 00:25:37.420, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:37.880 - 00:26:02.218, Speaker A: It's always attacks, right? Somebody who wrote a script and lives anywhere in the world, you know, can interact with. Nobody from the ecosystem ever is earning money from the participants in the ecosystem. And, you know, that's. If that's what the rules allow, you know, nothing against it. Ethically, that's fine. It's a way to make money, but it's always a tax. It either results in higher borrow costs.
00:26:02.218 - 00:26:22.008, Speaker A: If it's, you know, liquidations, it results in wider spreads. If it's. If it's. If it's an exchange, you know, it just has to come. Results in worse execution prices for customers if it's a telegram bought. And look, we have investments in these areas. If the cash flow is there and we think it's going to stay, we're happy to invest in it.
00:26:22.008 - 00:26:59.870, Speaker A: But I think as an ecosystem designer, you want to reduce this number to the lowest number possible, because it would just be the best customer experience for everybody who's a real part of your ecosystem. I think having the model that MeV is the basis of the token value leads you to conclusions that I just don't think anybody agrees with. Like right now in Solana, there's a lot of sandwiching, right. It's, I think, the major component of MeV and Solana right now. And, you know, the model would tell you that protocol devs might look at that and say, we don't want to reduce that, because then the value of Solana would go down. Nobody believes that. Right.
00:26:59.870 - 00:27:49.834, Speaker A: The other problem with that model is, I do think ultimately, all Meb goes to the applications, or the vast majority of it. You're seeing that right now with things like oracle extractable value, where oracles and lending protocols are splitting liquidation fees. That's just the beginning. You're seeing it with usmop V four hooks, where LP's and users are able to split the top of block sex to Dex MeV fees. You're just going to see that more and more, because who owns a customer? At the end of the day, it's not the validator. The validator gets to decide what goes in the block or not, but they're way downstream. Upstream, you have customers interacting with applications, and they have found ways to take that MeV, and they will continue to find more and more ways to take that MEV over time.
00:27:50.002 - 00:28:18.400, Speaker B: Yeah, it is interesting, because originally the argument for the app chains was you need an app chain to capture the MEV, because otherwise you don't get any of the MEV. And I think that's a kind of been proven false and will be continued to be more false over time, where applications can encode logic to capture more and more of that value if they create a useful application.
00:28:18.520 - 00:28:25.456, Speaker A: Yeah, I fully agree with that. Maybe that was true at the time, but it's certainly not true now. And it's not true it won't be true over time.
00:28:25.568 - 00:29:10.990, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think, yeah, it is interesting because, I mean, whether, like, the different order flows that are starting to emerge on chain, these private order flows, whether it's trying to continue to experiment with the new items. As you mentioned, what I've always been excited about with DeFi is potentially bringing all these people on chain, and then now it's, I think we have the inklings, but now we have to, quote, tighter spreads, we have to add more liquidity and build out all the necessary pieces to continue to get us there to convince more and more people to actually come on chain.
00:29:11.070 - 00:29:58.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Although I would say there's been a quiet Moore's law on chain for the past, since it started, really. But for the past three years, certainly, the things that we were looking at, because we started only looking at on chain protocols, the things we were looking at before focusing on cost and speed, are just dramatically different now. Right. Like, if you want to trade on perps, you know, on chain, three years ago, you were looking at 25 basis point spreads or more uniswap, when it started, was quoting 80 basis point spreads all in for ETH USDC. Now you're looking at kind of one and a half basis points for perps, you know, between that and five basis points on Uniswap. Like, that's Moore's law type of advancement.
00:29:58.346 - 00:30:11.430, Speaker A: Right? And we're seeing that across the board. So I really do think we're well on our way. It's just been we're well on our way with not that many builders focused on kind of financial primitives.
00:30:12.090 - 00:30:14.122, Speaker B: I agree. It's an exciting time.
00:30:14.186 - 00:30:15.270, Speaker A: It's an exciting time.
00:30:15.770 - 00:30:35.760, Speaker B: So I know you have the tradfi background. You're really deep in the weeds on the traditional finance markets and how that converges with blockchain rails. Are there any other areas of focus that you and the fund like to explore or learning more about?
00:30:36.380 - 00:31:09.426, Speaker A: Well, we always like learning more about what's going on in infrastructure, but only to the extent that it tells us, you know, what's going to be possible with on chain finance. So, no, I think our. The core of our philosophy is focus. You know, anything that's adjacent is worth reading about or learning about because it impacts your kind of circle of competence. But, you know, I think a lot of investors across history have lost a good thing because they lost focus. And I think it's kind of ten x is true in this industry, where there's always something more interesting to look at. There's always good yield somewhere.
00:31:09.426 - 00:31:17.514, Speaker A: There's always some interesting narrative. And if you don't really kind of tie yourself to the mast on circle of competence, it's easy to get directed there.
00:31:17.642 - 00:31:39.630, Speaker B: Yeah. I was talking with Kyle Smanidi from multicoin a while back, and his advice to new fund managers was know your area of competence and kind of know your strike zone. I think saying no is kind of a superpower. You don't have to swing at everything, and focusing is very important.
00:31:39.750 - 00:32:16.060, Speaker A: But within on chain finance, I mean, there's so much going on, right? Like, one thing that's really been covered lately that we've been excited about for a while is prediction markets and decision markets. That's such an interesting. Like, it's almost, you know, there have always been prediction markets, but really bringing them to a global scale could be so meaningful. Right. People have obviously seen what's happening with polymarket and the election, where it's. Where it's been ahead of the news cycle, bye hours or even days or even weeks, I think, in one case. And then I don't know if you've looked into decision markets, that's where futurkey plays.
00:32:16.060 - 00:32:43.952, Speaker A: Their name's been around for a while. So it's the idea. You can say, uniswap is going to potentially turn on a fee switch, then you make a conditional buy. You say, if they turn on the fee switch, then I'm willing to buy uniswap. Athenae, you know, this price, 650. If they don't, I don't want to know. So you, as an investor, you can actually take off a whole portion of the probability tree and only make a decision based on one part of it.
00:32:43.952 - 00:33:14.510, Speaker A: And the idea is, for investors, it's great because you get to kind of just refine your views. And the social benefit is it then signals information to decision makers. Right. You kind of see, in the Uniswap case, the market thinks our price would go up if we turn it on. And here's precisely the spread. The classic example is a decision about firing a CEO. So the market tells the board what the stock price is with the CEO and without the CEO.
00:33:14.510 - 00:33:23.430, Speaker A: And I think if you just amplify that, it starts to get really, really interesting what you could do with markets and predictions.
00:33:24.380 - 00:33:43.620, Speaker B: I agree. I like poly market. I think it's been very interesting with election. I hope they can continue the momentum and continue to expand that outside of politics after the election is over, because they definitely have product market fit for the election. We'll see if they can continue to expand that afterwards.
00:33:43.780 - 00:33:51.032, Speaker A: It'll be lumpy, probably, is my guess. It'll be hard to beat this year, next year. But that's the nature of things.
00:33:51.156 - 00:34:25.290, Speaker B: Um, I think kind of some of the things that you're touching upon, though, really kind of flags or ties into how you guys underwrite things, um, and think about markets holistically. And we kind of touched upon it in the beginning. I think this, though, we should probably double click into, because it is really core to your thesis, the fund, and just being very fundamentally driven in a market that historically has not been.
00:34:25.630 - 00:34:48.900, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So this is what we spoke about a little bit earlier with kind of a good faith model. We think the entire exercise comes down to making a prediction and being right. So the model, in a sense, is your prediction. And you say, here's here. It's always cases, right? It's all probability. So here are the cases that I see for this company over the next three years.
00:34:48.900 - 00:35:05.304, Speaker A: And I say three years because there is a limit to predictability in this industry. Things move too fast. So trying to make a ten year model, good luck. We always say they're not tire companies, so you really are. There's just a lot more uncertainty, maybe.
00:35:05.472 - 00:35:18.540, Speaker B: To clarify when you're underwriting these things, it's not like the traditional tradfi markets that are looking to, like, underwrite something, to, like a ten or 20%. You guys are underwriting to much larger outcomes.
00:35:18.620 - 00:35:41.582, Speaker A: We're underwriting to five to ten times over three years. That's what we think is our cost of capital. P firms do reliably make two and a half to three times over five years. But one, their hit rate is above 90%. Right. If they're wrong, they're wrong because they're making. They're never making 0.3,
00:35:41.582 - 00:36:16.600, Speaker A: which is possible in this industry if you're wrong. And two, they're just right more often because you're kind of underwriting to a tire company, growing 3% a year in its major, you know, 4% in the, in the best locations, and you have 15 years of history to prove that that's, that's the trend. So it's just, you know, if you can get two and a half to three times returns off that level of predictability, of predictability in a kind of established asset class, we think we need to make five to ten, underwrite to five to ten, then we're right, hopefully 70% of the time, and we're getting three and a half to seven, really, in three years.
00:36:17.460 - 00:36:30.668, Speaker B: That would be crazy returns, because I think for traditional venture markets, a good venture fund, which has a duration of ten years is generally a three x, and you're great.
00:36:30.724 - 00:36:52.310, Speaker A: If it's a five x, it's great returns. But we're one, we haven't proven them. Well, we have a few years of trajectory, but we haven't proven kind of the thesis fully. And two, we're trying to convince people who generally are afraid of the industry. Right. So you just, it would be great returns. But I do think that our cost of capital is around those areas.
00:36:52.970 - 00:37:35.990, Speaker B: I definitely agree. I just, I think it kind of underlies how quickly the industry is growing and that capital generally comes in. It comes in, explores. And I think the more that we have the underlying fundamentals, the more it will stay. And it has been lumpy in the past because you get these periods of hype and excitement, which I think are productive in the sense that it allows us to bring new capital in, raise new venture funds, fund these things to get us to kind of the next iteration. That allows us to continue to experimental and then reinforce the fundamentals once they actually hit scale.
00:37:36.150 - 00:37:45.086, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think telling a fundamental story will be easier to do most of the capital in the world than the stories we've been telling so far.
00:37:45.198 - 00:37:51.290, Speaker B: So do you think we have a retry of 2021 this go around?
00:37:53.120 - 00:38:15.248, Speaker A: We'll see. I think we spoke about this a little bit before the podcast. We try to not forecast macro too much. One, it's really hard. We're not macro geniuses. And even if you think you are, the probability is usually you're not. There have been five macro investors who have done well over a career that I know of.
00:38:15.248 - 00:38:44.298, Speaker A: Maybe there's ten, but it's a small number. And usually they're much smarter than I am. And we just think the kind of token picking game or asset picking game is much easier because I've seen a lot of people do well picking stocks or picking companies or doing venture thinking about fundamentals. So our view is macro is fun to think about, but not something we underwrite to or really try to predict too much. So I think the long way to saying we'll see.
00:38:44.394 - 00:39:38.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it has been interesting, just the booms and busts. I mean, 2021 was obviously extraordinary circumstances for a variety of reasons, but 2022 was kind of painful and deleveraging from the blockchain standpoint with Luna, with FTX 2023, kind of, we were licking our wounds and excitement kind of coming into the beginning of the year. It's when these things kind of move violently in both ways again. Are you guys just really just maniacally focused on underwriting these assets, making sure that they're producing, or eventually can produce some types of cash flows, and don't pay attention as much to say like, oh, we're in a bull market, we're in a bear market, et cetera, et cetera.
00:39:39.390 - 00:40:33.152, Speaker A: We only focus on it when we're thinking about entry multiples. You do have to shade whether it's a mid cycle multiple or a top of cycle multiple. If we're looking at banana gun, one of our investments. The meme cycle does matter for fundamentals, or kind of with, with something like Camino sole price and activity does matter for TVL. So these things do drive fundamentals. So it's not to say that we don't think about them at all, but we just like to, we like to be able to underweight kind of the cycles and think about the long term vision, what people are building, and how that matters for the company. I wish I could not think about it at all, but it's not possible, unfortunately.
00:40:33.256 - 00:40:57.376, Speaker B: True. And you mentioned in the beginning of the podcast, we were kind of talking about being on the opposite side of meme coins a little bit, and I think that has every quote unquote cycle has a unique thing emerge. And I think meme coins have kind of come back with vengeance. What are your thoughts on kind of meme coin arc currently?
00:40:57.488 - 00:41:24.810, Speaker A: Well, I think they're fun, right? I think they're kind of positive, you know, not positive ev, but they're. They're better. They're better lotteries than lotteries, right? Lotteries do kind of the Powerball billions. The whole point is getting to a billion, so you can advertise well. And then people have this kind of infinitesimal chance of winning, whereas meme coins in an up cycle, your odds are much better than that. Right? And most people don't want to win a billion dollars. They want to win a smaller amount of capital.
00:41:24.810 - 00:42:15.870, Speaker A: But the reason I said I like them is because they do kind of help the fundamentals thesis progress. Everyone has the same sample bias. Everyone who has a group of friends who are in the space trading kind of narrative tokens in 21 has that same group of friends trading meme coins this year, and they don't care at all about our narratives and our technical arguments, and they shouldn't. Right. One, for them it's really boring, for me it's interesting, for you it's interesting, but for them it's really boring. And two, you have this kind of VC unlock schedule working against you. If you're buying a pure narrative token, there are sellers into that that are kind of on the other side of the table from retail that just wants to buy an attractive lottery ticket.
00:42:15.870 - 00:42:53.164, Speaker A: Meme coins, they do have that. Obviously there are some people always try to include those things, but for the most part, they don't have the same amount of tokens unlocked and investing schedules. And I think to the extent that that group of buyers, retail, kind of speculative, high risk on retail, goes away from the narrative tokens, it forces us as investors to look at fundamentals and it forces protocols and builders to build towards fundamentals as well. So I like meme coins as a removing demand from what I think of as the wrong part of the market.
00:42:53.332 - 00:43:15.064, Speaker B: And I think this also touches upon kind of venture capital ultimately needs to fund tokens that build sustainable projects or services. And I think part of that's not launching at a billion dollar FTV unless that revenues or product justifies the billion FTV.
00:43:15.132 - 00:43:15.664, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:15.792 - 00:43:33.760, Speaker B: And allowing both liquid funds and retail to potentially participate in that upside. So when the token does a TG or officially comes live, it's not down. Only the chart looks terrible. People are excited that it's coming out, they're excited about using the product and it's sustainable.
00:43:33.880 - 00:44:11.108, Speaker A: Yeah, we talked about our cost of capital. We have to make, be able to underwrite to five to ten times returns on our investments. And that's not because we're being greedy, it's because that's what we need to tell our investors to get liquid fund capital in. You know, if you're launching off zero revenues in a billion FTV, we can't underwrite to that. So who's the buyer? That's what we always ask. Who's the buyer? You have 30% of the cap table, unlocking it over two years. Let's say you might be able to get enough kind of podcast appearances to get a narrative and kind of low flow buyers into a rally.
00:44:11.108 - 00:45:06.458, Speaker A: But then who's the ultimate buyer for 300 million of unlocks? The only pocket that's kind of big enough is the liquid fund pocket. And more and more very quickly, liquid funds are all thinking about fundamentals. So we're strict. We've kind of made it a brand, but everyone's thinking about this on the liquid side and they're all building their models and saying, I can't buy it a billion and expect to sell it at five to ten. There's nothing, you know, there's not a lot here yet, like it might be a great founders, great company making maybe some revenue, but it's, it's a series a company, right? So I think that kind of issuing at lower valuations, setting the expectation, allows you to do the proper cap table transition. Because what do you want as a liquor token? You don't want. I mean VC's are great for, for private markets and for helping you into launch and when you're an early product.
00:45:06.458 - 00:46:15.102, Speaker A: But the reality is most VC's need to sell eventually. That's the close end fund by nature needs to sell. So you want to have somebody who can buy up that supply over the long term and the only buyers you really want there are kind of liquid funds because we have the mandate to hold indefinitely as long as the project keeps growing and something you can re underwrite. And that's the way it works in traditional markets, right? Apple shareholders have seen it through kind of 30 great years and there's kind of serious funds that the CFO can go out to and communicate with and say, here are our targets, or here's why we miss our targets or whatever, and have a serious data driven conversation about the business. If you're trying to make that demand be all retail on your discord, you're going to have a schizophrenic token price and you're not going to have any value from your cap table. There's just people who kind of ship it up and ship it down, but you can't tell the group, here's a five year plan, or a three year plan, or even a one year plan, and here are the core metrics we're trying to underwrite to. So yeah, I think I'm biased, but lower issuance prices would be good and then we'd be happy to buy on day one.
00:46:15.286 - 00:47:15.850, Speaker B: So are there too many? I mean it's been an interesting conversation on Twitter or X in the last, I'd say three to six months about there are too many venture funds. And that's historically because during these boom periods you could bid an infrastructure round, you could do a layer one, whatever it was. These things would be at billion dollar ftvs and you would have high DPI marks that you could return back to LP's and go out and raise another venture fund. But I think as the asset class is maturing people are starting to ask, primarily driven by so many new projects launching and such high valuations, who's going to buy my tokens? And so the conversation has really shifted to, hey, potentially there are too many venture funds, or there are too many venture funds funding projects at too high FTV. Should there be more liquid funds?
00:47:17.080 - 00:47:32.820, Speaker A: I think there can be more venture funds and more liquid funds. They just need to be more fundamentals. That's the underlying issue. People are saying there should be more liquid funds, but the reality is there are not enough fundamentals for there to be materially more liquid funds than there are.
00:47:33.640 - 00:48:00.496, Speaker B: It probably goes back to venture being disciplined on like, hey, you got to show me these metrics for you to justify this valuation. But today, if you do that, you're going to get left behind. And so it's a very weird dichotomy today where everybody, at least what I appreciate is people are starting to think about these things, especially on the liquid side, I would say not as much so on the venture side, but the chicken will come home to roost.
00:48:00.688 - 00:48:36.246, Speaker A: It takes a while, because if you bought narrative, you got smoked. Bitcoin eth in a. Yeah, bitcoin eth Sol in a basket of kind of what we call value tokens have overperformed massively. Our basket of narrative tokens over the past 1234 years, since nine of 21, they've been overperforming constantly. So liquid funds have been learning the lesson through kind of repeated knocks. I think it takes longer on the venture side because you have. You can mark your book.
00:48:36.246 - 00:49:00.318, Speaker A: You know, there's this kind of liquid is truth that hits you in the face. Like, you can't pretend like you're marking something different. I used to do privates, we could tell you kind of think your mark is x, and someone could say it's y, but you can just say, I think it's x. Right? You know that, too. So it takes. The feedback mechanism is slower, but I think, you know, it kind of all flows downhill, right.
00:49:00.414 - 00:49:25.650, Speaker B: At Tesla, they very much encourage us to decrease your, or increase your feedback loop, make that as tight as possible. And so I think it's not only getting the allocators aligned with that, but also the founders. And I think ultimately, it's going to be painful, but it's going to be helpful for the entire market, and we will grow from this.
00:49:25.730 - 00:50:08.850, Speaker A: And that's one of the beauties of people do ask, and it's a fair question, why launch a token at all? Like, is it better on, is the VC cycle that we have in traditional venture. Better where you're private for eight years or 15 years. And the answer is, it's a hard thing to answer in favor of tokens because you have good shareholders that are helping you over a long period of time. Founders don't make too much money too early. I don't think it's good for anyone to make too much money too early, or at least it may be good for them, but it's not good for the business that they're building. Same is true for funds for everyone. Why launch a token at all? And I think one of the main benefits is this feedback loop.
00:50:08.850 - 00:50:21.890, Speaker A: If we can actually structure a good, disciplined set of buyers on the liquid side, you can have immediate feedback, whereas in a private company setting, it just takes longer to get that feedback.
00:50:23.180 - 00:51:11.136, Speaker B: The thing that we've also been harping on with the token that's beneficial is just that global nature, not having it only be us bound having a global audience, all the benefits that blockchains kind of provide. And I think it's also nice that potentially tokens can go live at tens of millions, hundreds of millions of FTV instead of the tens billions that historically the IPO market has had. Because it was nice kind of looking historically, all these companies coming out in hundreds of millions of market cap, and today that's just not the case. And so Uber, what came out at 50 billion or something. So it'd be nice for the retail people to ultimately participate in some of this upside as well.
00:51:11.168 - 00:51:19.454, Speaker A: Yeah, and to your point, global, right? The number of people in the world who want to own Apple stock that just can't because their local broker doesn't let them, is astonishing to people.
00:51:19.592 - 00:51:37.274, Speaker B: So I want to shift the podcast a little bit to some things that you're personally excited about or potentially even hold within the fund. Kind of on this theme of focus on the fundamentals potentially can produce lots of cash flows in the future.
00:51:37.402 - 00:51:40.194, Speaker A: Yeah. Great. So I'll just talk my book, if that's okay with you.
00:51:40.242 - 00:51:41.882, Speaker B: Please do show us your bags.
00:51:41.946 - 00:52:47.974, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess one thing I'll say upfront is we do take a very kind of activist partner role with all of our companies, and these are all companies that we kind of speak to constantly and kind of have grown to really care about both the teams and the visions. But maybe to hit on one and kind of get to the underwriting kind of the way that we underwrite, as an example, would be vertex. Vertex is a purpose protocol. It's on EVM now, but I think there. Their vision for perps is it doesn't matter where you are if you're on chain, because if you have off chain matching on chain settlement with a ZK proof that you matched and liquidated, according to your docs, you can be in every chain without being on any chain and actually have liquidity across chains cancel out. You have native cross chain liquidity, and you have much, much faster time to settlement than you can have on any one blockchain.
00:52:47.974 - 00:53:29.290, Speaker A: So even Solana is the best that we have now. I think the best case I've seen in Solana, anyone mentioned is 100 milliseconds. Maybe it can be better than that, but that's still a lot of adverse selection for perps, for derivatives, their vision is you want to get that down to five milliseconds, and that just makes for tighter spreads. It just makes for the elimination of all of these predatory strategies that are possible when you have long block times. And you can only do that with this kind of off chain matching on chain settlement model. But vertex has a great team and to talk about. They have a good vision.
00:53:29.290 - 00:53:56.430, Speaker A: We think, and we fundamentally think that the on chain economy is kind of first target is the sex target is binance. Because I would love to get the whole world trading digital assets, but the reality is we have a lot of people trading digital assets now. We have a ton of volume. It's just all in binance. And if all we do for the next five years is get that volume on chain, or even a portion of it, there should be enough for a lot of teams to make a lot of money.
00:53:57.370 - 00:54:18.972, Speaker B: Someone tweeted, I can't remember who, and I retweeted it and said something along the lines of, like, this chart is the most important chart within crypto. And the chart ultimately articulated the centralized exchange volumes to decentralized exchange volumes, and I think has gone up from ten to 14 or 15%.
00:54:19.036 - 00:54:53.826, Speaker A: And it's up only basically, if you look at it on an annual basis, it's up only since Uniswap launched almost six years ago, that same thing is happening in perps. So perps in 22 were less than 1% on chain. Last year, there were 2%. This year, they're actually at 4.5% on chain. We think that number is going to 9% over the next two and a half years on a conservative estimate. We're always looking for ways to play that, because these volumes, 9% of perps, is.
00:54:53.826 - 00:55:32.094, Speaker A: You don't have to think about macro, you don't need any market growth, you can just make really good returns with just that one number. So Vertex is kind of the team that we back there to play that trend. A lot of it's team quality, a lot of it's. We really focus on customer experience, and we found that a lot of protocols in this space were really focused on incentives and incentives as a way, incentives and kind of points as a way to get a token up. And then not every team wanted to stay in the industry, I'd say. And that's something we really try to weed out. The vertex team, they're missionaries, they're not mercenaries.
00:55:32.094 - 00:56:16.610, Speaker A: And that's kind of probably the first question we ask at the end, or the first question we ask ourselves in IC, and they're just fast and cheap. They trade at 1.5 basis points on spreads, and then they trade at kind of ten second, ten millisecond, 10th millisecond matching times. So maybe to kind of double click quickly on underwriting there, because you were talking about it earlier, we have this prediction that the purse market will get to eight above 8% over two and a half years of the off chain market. And we also think that they're going to go from 7.5 to 17.5% market share because of what we see as their embedded advantages.
00:56:16.610 - 00:56:37.918, Speaker A: That's our whole model. Right. So, like, you know, we talk about models, it could be this complicated thing. The model model is just a prediction that you put on paper, right. If those two things happen, their revenue should go from 20 million to 80 million. We bought it, you know, at a low multiple on the 20. And if they're making 80, our investment should.
00:56:37.918 - 00:56:46.758, Speaker A: Should be in that five to ten times range on any kind of reasonable exit multiple. So, yeah, just a long way of saying a model is just a prediction.
00:56:46.854 - 00:57:28.634, Speaker B: Nice. I love it. And I think, to your point, on the product side, that could be echoed across a lot of teams that are currently building today, is when you have financial experimentation and give people a sandbox to play and try many things. People want to financialize everything, but I think that's fine experimentation, but the product also still has to be good. And at the end of the day, if the product sucks, if the UI sucks, I mean, people come and give you free money or take free money if they can, but then afterwards, the sugar rush, people will leave. And so it's good to also know that they're super focused on the product side.
00:57:28.722 - 00:57:53.118, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess in every kind of incentive cycle, you have to ask the classic question of if there's a sucker at the table. And if it's not, if you don't know who it is, it's you who's paying that money. If you're playing that token game, someone's paying for that. I won't guess on air who it is, but someone's paying for it. Money never comes from nowhere.
00:57:53.174 - 00:58:06.472, Speaker B: Yep. Maybe. One other that I think we have mutually shared interest in is metaplex. Can you talk just briefly about Metaplex? And what got you excited about the Metaplex team?
00:58:06.576 - 00:58:41.112, Speaker A: That was a fantastic one. Sad to say, we did not discover that one. We learned it from a pure fund modular. They're very smart, but that's one where what we call banker work was very important. So banker work is kind of getting a token with mismatched information and no kind of maybe a bad cap table, maybe a bad story to the market and kind of helping them navigate the public markets. Right. Like what mess makers do in traditional finance is an important role.
00:58:41.112 - 00:59:22.290, Speaker A: So they were a monopoly in nfts, or let's say predominant nfts, to not use that word. And they're making really good cash. So they're making about 8500 sol a month right now. And they have been around that level for a long time. But the markets didn't like them because one, they had a terrible cap table, right? They kind of raised in 21 from a bunch of celebrities and a lot of people who've left, you know, FTX and a lot of people who've left the industry since jump. And two, they didn't always have the proper love in the silicon community, as you know, because of some history. And three, there was no value to the token and nobody ever knew if there would be.
00:59:22.290 - 00:59:52.060, Speaker A: So as soon as we made that investment, we sat down with part of the team. We were like, these are the four issues we think are holding your token back. They are well aware of it. They have an excellent team. You've just seen each one of those get resolved over the last year. Since then, the cap table has gotten much better. It's a lot of names that we would love to have in our other tokens, the good holders, reasonable people who talk to the team and talk about what the best way forward is.
00:59:52.140 - 01:00:32.884, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, it's interesting. On the liquid side, you're really shopping for these hidden gems where there's massive pricing discrepancies. And ultimately, I think in an industry that's run by narratives, the narratives can ultimately be very crack sometimes. And seeding out the bullshit from reality. There is a lot of digging, but metaplex and the team, I am excited. They kind of had the hype cycle, the bear cycle, and now, I hope, on the slope of enlightenment.
01:00:33.052 - 01:00:55.620, Speaker A: Yeah. They actually earn money with every new token create, so they earn monies off meme coins as well. But it's less than NFTs and NFTs aren't really up from cycle lows, so it's still one where you can be comfortable that the bottom is in and there's probably significant upside to the core drivers.
01:00:56.200 - 01:01:18.140, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe as wrapping up, are there any unique things that we didn't touch upon that you either want to share about your thought process, the fund, kind of like how you think the space is evolving? I think we've touched upon a good amount, but anything that you want to double click on before we wrap up?
01:01:18.440 - 01:01:45.426, Speaker A: No, I'd say the main thing is believe in something. Believe in on chain finance. There's a lot that can be done. We see teams building incredible products and options in lending and long tail asset lending. Boosted pools are a great idea. I hope they can work one day. There's all these amazing financial innovations that are possible here, and they've kind of been.
01:01:45.426 - 01:02:13.906, Speaker A: We talked a lot about infrastructure and some of these vc investments, but the reality is they got us to where we are in terms of what's possible. And if that process hadn't gone on the way it had, we wouldn't have fast blockchains, we wouldn't have low latencies, low fees, and a lot of unique architectures. So it's now there and there's a lot of good ideas out there. Just would love to see people who are building those ideas. And there's a lot of people there, but there's not enough.
01:02:14.098 - 01:02:18.950, Speaker B: How can people learn more about you or the fund? Get in touch.
01:02:20.050 - 01:02:31.650, Speaker A: So my Twitter theoresearch at theaaresearch or Noah's Twitter tradernoa, those are probably the two. Two of us kind of constantly tweeting, cool, awesome.
01:02:31.730 - 01:03:02.324, Speaker B: And maybe just wrapping it up on kind of New York. It's been interesting just watching New York kind of become more of a hub for crypto, which is a little weird considering it's not Silicon Valley or other places. And I think that's in large part because Silicon Valley maybe has a too much of a crush on AI and kind of shun crypto for too long. But it's cool to see all the talent here. Colas and New York and a lot of smart people.
01:03:02.452 - 01:03:30.274, Speaker A: It's nice. Yeah. So I live in the same apartment I used to live in when I had my old job in buyouts, and most of my meetings probably have two meetings a day within five minutes. So for me, it's been nice to kind of join a new industry and realize it was in my backyard in a sense. But it's also just really good energy. Like, people here meet constantly, meeting constantly getting after work, drinks, lunch. And people who don't live here are here multiple months out of the year.
01:03:30.274 - 01:03:37.554, Speaker A: So the first thing I tell people who are kind of younger on the fun side is just move to New York and then you can figure everything else out.
01:03:37.722 - 01:03:44.962, Speaker B: I did the opposite. I moved to Miami and was like, I need warm weather and beaches to clear my head with the computer.
01:03:45.026 - 01:03:49.226, Speaker A: There's benefits to you can be more contrary where you don't live in the main city.
01:03:49.338 - 01:04:05.584, Speaker B: That is true. The independent thought, well, maybe ended on that. Think from first principles, think from fundamentals. But really appreciate you coming on the podcast. I think this conversation is only going to get louder and louder over the next six to 24 months, and I think you guys are spearheading that.
01:04:05.632 - 01:04:06.776, Speaker A: So thank you for having me.
01:04:06.848 - 01:04:07.120, Speaker B: Thank you.
