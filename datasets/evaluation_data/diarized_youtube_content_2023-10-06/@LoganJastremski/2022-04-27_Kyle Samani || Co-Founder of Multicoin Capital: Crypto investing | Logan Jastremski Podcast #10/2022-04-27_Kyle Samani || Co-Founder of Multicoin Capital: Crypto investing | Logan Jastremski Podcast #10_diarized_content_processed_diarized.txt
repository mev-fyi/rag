00:00:00.320 - 00:00:00.998, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you.
00:00:01.014 - 00:00:07.702, Speaker B: Kyle Logan, thanks for having me on the show and coming out. And we got our hidden room with just curtains, I guess.
00:00:07.766 - 00:00:11.822, Speaker A: No, it's a great room. They do well for sound dampening.
00:00:12.006 - 00:00:15.622, Speaker B: That's true. Yeah. You'll get the reflection or whatever echo.
00:00:15.726 - 00:00:25.334, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Once again, I really appreciate you coming on the show. I appreciate you responding to my cold email. So thank you.
00:00:25.422 - 00:00:34.704, Speaker B: I like to respond to cold emails if they're well written. It's always good. Good stuff comes through. We've had deals come through that way. A bunch of good things in my life have come from cold emails. So I'm a fan.
00:00:34.792 - 00:01:07.730, Speaker A: Nice. Nice. Cool. Well, yeah, I think in this space, one of the biggest hardships, I think, is kind of thinking long term and thinking from first principles. And you and Tushar and multicoinous, I think, have done a phenomenal, phenomenal job about thinking from first principles. Could you touch upon just how that process is or how you kind of arrive at the first principle of thinking?
00:01:08.470 - 00:01:58.448, Speaker B: Sure. Thank you. A little flatter, but appreciate it. So I think it's mostly about calling bullshit, and it's actually a very not fun process. The way human brain works is you have heuristics and assumptions because you can't think through every little detail of everything all of the time, otherwise your brain would explode. I think first principles of thinking is, hey, an idea enters your mind, you say it, and if other people around you don't try and pick it apart and call bullshit on whatever the assumptions are, then that's how I'd say you drift away from first principles thinking. And so it's a very methodical process and it's a very not fun process in the sense of just like, it's literally like someone says something and there's maybe something interesting there, but then you have to say, no, no, no, this assumption's wrong.
00:01:58.448 - 00:02:21.070, Speaker B: This assumption's wrong. And really keep unpacking until you get all the way down to it and you say, okay, well, there's these six related concepts, and, like, we thought all six of them were valid. It turns out only three of them are valid. Okay, like, is the, do you still want to invest? Like, maybe those three that don't matter. Right. Like, whatever. And just kind of being very systematic in, like, breaking that down.
00:02:21.070 - 00:02:39.550, Speaker B: And it's like, fairly confrontational and adversarial. It's not rude, but it's definitely like, you know, if you're an outside person and you watch our investment committee meetings, you'd be like, dude, these people are not friendly. And it's, you know, just getting used to that culture and that kind of style of feedback and reasoning.
00:02:39.850 - 00:02:45.450, Speaker A: So it's just continuing to unpack things to. Again and again.
00:02:45.610 - 00:02:53.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, just keep peeling it back. You have to constantly question what the other people say and try and dig down to the deeper truth.
00:02:53.642 - 00:03:10.772, Speaker A: Is there, like, a methodology that you learned, like, how to do that? For me at Tesla, it was drilled onto us, like, you have to do this to move forward. But I'm curious, how you learned or how you taught yourself. Is it just something you practice?
00:03:10.916 - 00:03:37.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, just kind of. It's fairly intuitive for Tashar and I and how we operate. I think the part that required a little bit of, I guess you could call it training or practice was just like, the culture and IC and, like, how to do it best mechanically. You know, you have eight, nine people, whatever, chatting about stuff. What we've actually done is moved towards away from talking. And actually, more, I see, happens in writing in the Google Doc itself.
00:03:37.360 - 00:04:02.140, Speaker B: And so we are leaving comments in line, and then people are responding. And so now you can have six or seven conversations going concurrently. Someone puts something down, someone goes and grabs a link or whatever, and it's fun because then six months later, a year later, you end up pulling up a memo for whatever reason, and you look at the comments, and it's pretty funny to see how you thought about it and how things get pushed back.
00:04:02.880 - 00:04:28.240, Speaker A: I also admire the writing. When you talk about things, there's a lot of nuance that can be left out, especially in technical discussions that just is completely removed. Or someone could say something, and a lot of the surrounding context can just be left out and kind of glossed over. But I appreciate that writing forces you to articulate your gaps in thinking.
00:04:28.660 - 00:05:01.560, Speaker B: Yeah, it is much easier to call bullshit on someone's thinking and writing in person. It's like, are you gonna stop the mid sentence? This is a little more difficult. And then even just certain formatting things. So we require investment. Thesis summaries have to be three sentences or less, has to be super, super light. Whenever you're gonna talk about bullet lists of things, you have to do separate hard lines with numbers, and then you can refer back to. Then it makes referring back to things much easier in the document and such.
00:05:01.560 - 00:05:17.654, Speaker B: I mean, our memos are fairly structured, too. They all have the same subsection headers, and people just fill in those. And so it's just kind of like creating the context and the structure so that you can most productively disagree. Right?
00:05:17.782 - 00:05:46.350, Speaker A: And this is maybe another question, like, how do you disagree in a way that is elegant? Or how do you set up the fun to disagree? Because I think learning how to disagree is also one of the most important aspects of investing. Because not everybody is going to agree on a variety of things. Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. But eloquently disagreeing, respecting other people's opinions while listening to them, how do you set up that process?
00:05:48.890 - 00:06:23.578, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just everyone understands. I think it's a little bit of a cultural shock for new employees on the investment team that, like, I'll just say, like, literally, I will comment frequently in people's documents and just say, this is wrong. And like, we don't even discuss it. I just leave it there, it's fine. And like, I'm sure that new people are like, wow, that was like not a good meeting or whatever, but like, I've already forgotten about it 9 seconds later and like moved on. So it's not personal. And like, you just have to accept, like, it's okay, like, to be wrong.
00:06:23.578 - 00:06:49.690, Speaker B: We're in the business of hopefully being right, but a lot of times we're wrong. And so not taking it personally and just understanding that it's about the process and making sure that the culture of the team and the expectations are set, that everyone just knows, knows that and kind of leadership from the top. Tushar and I both practice this and everyone kind of understands that. I think everyone understands once they've been doing it for a while, why we all think it's kind of the optimal way to do it and make decisions.
00:06:50.270 - 00:07:33.380, Speaker A: It makes sense, I hope, to do something similar. So I think it works well, ultimately, one thing that I thought was super interesting in one of the podcasts that I heard you speak to was blockchain's kind of like at a high level, people have been describing them as operating systems or like Google Cloud, but you kind of mentioned them like blockchains at a more fundamental level, like just compete for developers. Could you kind of like go more into that topic and like how you would describe blockchains holistically? Like maybe in your words?
00:07:34.920 - 00:08:17.162, Speaker B: Sure. I mean, like, what does blockchain do? It's like getting a bunch of nodes to agree on something. In this case, the something is you can simplify it as the Merkle route, or you can say it's the state tree, basically. And what are you tracking in the state tree, basically? Just who has how many coins is really all that's there. And so that's what a blockchain does. It's like a stunningly simple concept. And obviously blockchains make it easy to create new coins, make it very easy to transfer coins, swap coins, do stuff with them.
00:08:17.162 - 00:08:52.109, Speaker B: But at the end of the day, it's just keeping track of who has that many coins. That's really it. Parts of the state have relevancy to each other. They're like the basic thing of like, well, the price of ETH USD is like x or. Right. And so there's some mathematical relationship between ETH and USD. But these systems get more interesting as there's more parts of the state that are mathematically tied to each other.
00:08:52.109 - 00:09:50.116, Speaker B: And so the next kind of obvious example is derivatives, and obviously there's funding rates and whatever else that kind of make all these systems work. But there you have a very clear coupling between different parts of the system, I should say different pieces of state because there's not mathematical relationships between these things. And in NFT land, we haven't really seen much yet that has mathematical relationships other than just here's 10,000 apes of the same collection. But that's not very interesting. Obviously, my hope is that people will build games, experiences, whatever that have nfts have more value where parts of the state have more value and meaning relative to other parts of the state. So you get these three things, something new happens. Hey, if you take the people of 5000 days photo, break it up into 5000 pieces, obviously you should.
00:09:50.116 - 00:10:19.750, Speaker B: If you collect nine of them or square or something, I don't know, you need to come up with some social experiments around these things. And that really hasn't happened yet in a super serious way. I'd say that's been a little slower than I would've expected. But even then you form a Dao and then the DaO buys assets. All those parts of the state are related to each other. There's always some tie in ownership. Blockchain is really about representing those relationships.
00:10:21.760 - 00:10:51.072, Speaker A: Do you think that shared state as a whole is like. I don't know. I know you've talked about also roll ups and sharding and kind of the trade offs between those and with the state on different, I don't know, different. Not blockchains or roll ups or different shards. Do you think that shared state is the most important aspect of the blockchains?
00:10:51.176 - 00:10:56.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really what they are, is keeping track of who has how many coins. That really is it.
00:10:58.160 - 00:12:00.010, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. Awesome. I think it's just very interesting if you try to continue to break down the parts and what ultimately is the useful stuff that blockchains can do, how they can provide value to us. So I appreciate your wording. Another interview that I saw you, I think, I believe with Raj, like early in the day, and also in one of your blog posts that you wrote, you were very intrigued by, I mean, Solana had, I think, eight or nine main key innovations that Anatoly wrote about, but the three that you highlighted were sea level proof of history and turbine. And correct me if I'm wrong, but could you explain or kind of go a little bit more into depth of each of those and why you found within Solana those each to be novel.
00:12:01.550 - 00:12:54.510, Speaker B: Sure. So proof of history is kind of, I guess, the foundation of Solana. So if you look at how do you do high performance distributed systems in a trusted environment? So, like Google, for example, or Amazon or Facebook or whatever, and how do these guys deal with conflicting transactions and ordering them all over the world? The answer is they have a clock and everything is timestamped. That's obviously a very simple solution and makes perfect sense. The problem in a decentralized system with permissionless consensus is, well, who's providing the clock? There's no one. The proof, history is the closest thing to a trust minimized clock. It's pretty important base thing in Solana.
00:12:54.510 - 00:13:50.210, Speaker B: The way it works is one thing, until I realized was you want to be able to prove the passage of time, and you can do that by just taking a single shot 256 hash and just recursively running it. What's great about this is that you can verify it much quicker than you can run it originally, because let's say you run the hash a million times, run the loop a million times. Well, if you have 1000 cores, you can take one 1000th of it. And because you already know the intermediate steps, you can then check all 1000 of those in parallel. You have to do it sequentially the first time. So it's a pretty clever way to then have a way to just, with math, prove the passage of time, which is pretty cool. And then once you have that, then basically every time you run through the hash, you've now incremented time forward, so to speak.
00:13:50.210 - 00:14:10.770, Speaker B: Now you can timestamp all the transactions. Once you do that, it's a pretty powerful idea. It's like the clock, so to speak, for the system. That's base innovation number one. We wrote an essay on this on our blog a few years ago. I think it's called the Separation of time and state. If you want to go a little further on that.
00:14:10.770 - 00:15:15.312, Speaker B: The next one is c level. C level is just the runtime. Again, the base problem with scaling these blockchain things is you're trying to get 7 billion people to use the same computer, which is obviously not really possible, given that you really want to be optimizing performance, and you want to make sure that every registry of memory is being used optimally and every cpu cycle is being used optimally and such. And so I would actually argue that blockchain systems are a lot like, just performance is key, and you need to maximize every ounce of performance because of that reality. And it was very clear to us when talking with Anatoly early on, I'm not an operating systems guy, a virtual machine guy. I don't appreciate all that stuff, but his entire career was doing that. So he knows how to get rid of all the overhead in a system and get something down to the metal and run as low as possible.
00:15:15.312 - 00:15:56.050, Speaker B: So you maximize performance. Over the years. A general thing that's happened in software over 30 or 40 years is just like, as the computers got faster, you got tool sets that became more and more abstracted, which made it easier to build functional applications. But all those tools and frameworks and operating systems and services and stuff were consuming parts of some of the system resources. So trade off is like flexibility and ease of use versus performance, which has been fine for general software development. But when you go back to, hey, how do we get 7 billion people to use the same computer? That's no longer a valid way to think about the problem. And so that always struck us as very important.
00:15:56.050 - 00:16:30.588, Speaker B: And it's been written in Rust. And again, Rust is been the number one language on stack overflow for, like, six years in a row or something. So it feels like Rust is really kind of hitting its prime, as it is generally loved. And then the third is turbine, which is block propagation. And so you got this globally distributed set of nodes. How do you get the data between all of them? Basically, the general answer for most blockchain things appears to be a gossip protocol. A GATs protocol is approximately what you think it is.
00:16:30.588 - 00:17:01.110, Speaker B: It's literally, you hear something, and then you just spit it back out to other people, and they do the same thing. If you do that, then data gets propagated through a network. It's obviously very resilient. If one node turns off randomly or whatever Internet pipes break, the system will keep working. It's nice for that function, but it's obviously very inefficient. Turbine is intended to be the most optimal way to distribute data through network. It's very inspired by the Bittorrent protocol.
00:17:01.110 - 00:17:38.862, Speaker B: The basic idea is, hey, take whatever piece of data you want to send, break it up into pieces and then send parts of it to these other two nodes, and then send a different set to these different set of nodes and a different set of nodes. And then those guys rebroadcast to everyone else. You can do this and you get logarithmic benefits by doing this, and you maximize total data that can flow through the network in this way. So it's a clever system. You need to add some erasure coding and some other things in there to add some fault tolerance, which I'll not cover right now, but it's a very clever design to maximize the data distribution.
00:17:39.046 - 00:18:13.920, Speaker A: Yeah, I've read those papers, the medium papers, multiple times. And every time I read them I feel like I learned something new and just how clever they actually are. They're very impressive. And one big misnomer that I feel most people get confused on with c level is that the single threaded compute has kind of hit its asymptote, but not multi core performance. And the multi core performance is still very much increasing. And I think people get that confused with Moore's law.
00:18:14.630 - 00:19:02.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I should have touched on that with the c level, I forgot. But yeah, I mean, if you like, I've been following computer hardware stuff since I was like seven or whatever. And I remember every year the intel whatever, Pentium three or whatever, it was like it was 400, it was 800, it was 1.6. And that was the Pentium four in the gigahertz race. And I remember we thought in 2001 that we're going to have 50 GHz computers in 2010. That obviously ended up not being the case. And kind of since call it end of the two thousands or so, cpu performance in just clock terms has not gone up at all and actually maybe has even gone down.
00:19:02.270 - 00:19:44.842, Speaker B: And so all of the gains have come from improving the architectures and then custom chips and parallelism. If you look at among those parallelism is where the bulk of the gains have come from. You can see this too. Apple, every year when they launch the iPhone, they always show these same two slides and they show iPhone year over year CPU performance and iPhone year over year GPU performance. And if you zoom out to the ten year chart and look at those two, the GPU one is way, way, way steeper than the cpu one. This has been true for a while. It seems obvious to me that like, okay, well, we need to optimize the software system, given the realities of hardware.
00:19:44.986 - 00:20:37.300, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think it totally makes sense. It's a brilliant design. One other thing that I'm super interested by, you've said Solana has a clear path to a million tps, which I think is, I'm confident it will get there. But on the larger term, you think there'll be millions of tps, or hundreds of millions of tps that are required to actually have the world's population use blockchains. How do you envision Solana going from a million or from now to a million? And then how do you foresee blockchains, whether Solana, or holistically, going from 1 million to the hundreds that we will need?
00:20:38.800 - 00:21:04.130, Speaker B: Yeah. So from here to get to call it a million. Handful of things. I mean, general performance optimizations they can continue to do. They'll probably get another two x, maybe three x out of that over several years. There's a lot of low hanging fruit of stuff they haven't done, especially around storage and how they access memory and stuff. So just kind of handling those things will help then.
00:21:04.130 - 00:21:47.430, Speaker B: The big one, though, is just the hardware is getting faster and the networks are getting faster, so just let that happen. Quic, which is launching, I think, in the next week or two, fingers crossed, will help a lot of reduce overhead on network operations. There's all of these things they can do all throughout the stack, but then just let the networks get faster, let the hardware get faster. You'll get another between network performance and cpu performance in both increasing, you'll be there within a few years. You'll get another ten x out of that. So that gets you into the million range from where we are today. The question is, how do you get another 100 x on top of that? And that is not terribly clear.
00:21:47.430 - 00:22:48.576, Speaker B: Just given laws of just how fast can move electrons, ZK rollups may be part of the answer. You may just have multiple chains and have bridges where there's wormhole or layer zero or something else, the bridge between them. Not super clear to me how that nets out. Or you may just have it where the systems are coming along it call it a million and just people do batching off chain and whatever other mechanics they can get to. I think it's okay that you're near a million of demand and the million of supplies available. You don't want fees to become prohibitively expensive. It'll be interesting to see in an ethereum you have a single gas auction per block, but in Solana you have a gas auction per part of state, per block, or per slot, I guess, in Solano's terms.
00:22:48.576 - 00:23:07.752, Speaker B: So you're running now, theoretically, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of auctions per second concurrently. It'll be interesting to see how that fee market develops over time. The prices don't necessarily have to go up a lot in that environment, so.
00:23:07.896 - 00:23:47.200, Speaker A: We'Ll kind of see that makes sense. Touching on ZK rollups and a super high level. I kind of think about them in the dumbest terms. Data compression back down to the l one if they're using it as a roll up. I'm curious how you would describe. We don't really need to touch on optimistic roll ups unless you want to, but I think zks are the path forward with ZK roll ups. How do you envision those progressing over next couple of years or so, and their role in l one more holistically.
00:23:50.700 - 00:24:32.790, Speaker B: Making any projections on ZK rollups is very difficult because there can be some breakthrough tomorrow, or not, who knows? And even once there is breakthrough, it's unclear how long it'll take to get into production. So, for example, there was a series of breakthroughs. I believe it was the fall of 2019. There was a new ZK breakthrough every three weeks for three months, and it was like some guy come up with something, everyone else read it, and then the other researchers were like, tweaked it and came up with some new math or whatever. And there's been, I think, relatively few major breakthroughs since then. And I think most of that stuff, it took another year and a half to get into production. So it's pretty hard to make predictions here.
00:24:32.790 - 00:25:44.070, Speaker B: My general sense is that they will not be competitive with just normal code, non ZK code, within a few years. I think that's quite unlikely, because I think just the complexity of the systems and the proofs and everything is just so high. There is a theoretical world in five or ten years in which ZK code is the same developer experience and same usability and general understanding as non ZK code. I'm an optimist, so I think we'll get to somewhere where that's almost true, but I think that's fairly far away. So then the other kind of related question is, will these things get adoption? And the answer is yes, to some degree, but it's fairly unclear, again, how that's gonna play out. I think there's too much focus on the Zkevm stuff. I like Cairo more for that reason, Starknaut's stuff.
00:25:44.070 - 00:26:15.880, Speaker B: But also I don't think we fully appreciate the limits of those systems, cause they're not really in production. And so it's hard to reason about what you can and can't do with them specifically. They'll get some adoption for sure. It's not obvious to me that they will necessarily get a ton of adoption. That's going to primarily be a function of do developers build amazing things on top of them? The answer's possible, but again, the dev tooling sucks. It's all new, no one understands how to use it, whatever. We'll see.
00:26:16.620 - 00:26:31.420, Speaker A: That totally makes sense in a world that ZK rollups do work well. How do you kind of envision that with composability? Like just one giant ZK that you can compose with it?
00:26:32.320 - 00:27:02.030, Speaker B: Probably, yeah, something like that. I expect there will be multiple of these things simply for political reasons. Someone will say I don't like this other guy. And they have a lot of the tokens for whatever. It's either their l one or their l two. And therefore I'm just going to fork this shit because it's open source and do my own version of it. So human greed necessitates that you'll have multiple competing things.
00:27:02.030 - 00:27:49.770, Speaker B: But yeah, I don't see any reason why a handful of ZK roll ups can't be pretty helpful. And certainly you can do atomic composability within them. Again, theoretically, we'll see how well it works in practice. And the other thing to watch here is watching really wormhole in Stargate. Excuse me? Wormhole in layer zero. As message passing systems, you can theoretically build any part of logic on any network and relay messages between them. In practice, it's unclear what exactly the boundaries will be of what's the best way to manage state and relationships.
00:27:49.770 - 00:28:27.836, Speaker B: Because you have to assume somewhat. Faultiness is the bridge operates and things go. Maybe you can have assets, collateral on one chain, and maybe you can take out debt on another chain. That may work, but if you want to do something that looks like margin five, for example, which is a full blown prime brokerage, maybe that doesn't work in this setting. So it's just unclear the limits of that in practice theory, layer zero and wormhole can do anything. In practice, I think we'll find practical limits of what people are willing to build.
00:28:27.908 - 00:29:17.782, Speaker A: I totally agree. Yeah, I'm super interested to see how it all unfolds. I think overall though, the less parts we kind of and the less complicated we make them all, I think the better. But we'll see how ultimately it ends up kind of jumping off that note with, like, composability and like, single shard. I'm curious, super curious to learn more about aptos. I know their consensus algorithm is hot stuff, and then they have a similar or slightly different programming language move. Could you go into a little bit of both of those and kind of like, I don't know just why you like it?
00:29:17.966 - 00:29:48.090, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to sort on hot stuff. So, in general, I think consensus algorithms are overrated in their importance in these systems. They're obviously necessary. And I do realize bitcoin like that was kind of the key thing that made it possible. But the design space for these things is fairly well understood. More or less. All of them, with the exception of Avalanche and proof of work, are PBFT.
00:29:48.090 - 00:30:19.708, Speaker B: Basically, that includes Solana. They call it tower, but again, it's basically PBFT, which has been around for 20 some odd years. This is well understood. I don't find them to be that interesting, and I don't think they're the primary bottleneck in scaling these systems. But hot stuff is cool. It's well liked, it's well reviewed, that's fine. But the other one that's much more interesting to me is move.
00:30:19.708 - 00:31:08.040, Speaker B: Because move is exposed to the developers. Obviously, they have to build in it. Solana takes a fairly opinionated approach, which is, dude, it's just rust, and just do whatever you want and good luck. Hopefully I don't write bad code, and my free speech idealist likes that approach. But there's a lot of people who, no one wants to be the guy who wrote the line of code that had the bug that blew up $500 million. And there are startup founders who are willing to do that stuff, which is one thing, but then if you work at big company x, you find that to be somewhat scary. You think about your job and your kids and whatever, by the argument that there's a class of developers that wants a more, a safer, basically sandbox to play in, not quite as sharp on the edges.
00:31:08.040 - 00:31:33.420, Speaker B: And look, I'm a programming languages expert, but from what we can gather, move is very well designed to make it much harder to hurt yourself and preserves more or less all of the performance that you get in something like rust. So I kind of like that model, and I think that will have a pretty strong appeal to some developers.
00:31:33.540 - 00:31:39.680, Speaker A: Nice. And does Aptos also able to figure out the clock problem?
00:31:40.860 - 00:31:44.132, Speaker B: No. So they're not using anything like proof history and hot stuff is just pbft.
00:31:44.236 - 00:31:56.252, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. Very cool. No, I'm trying to learn more about it. I'm excited for their testnet and then upcoming, I think public beta or launch later this year.
00:31:56.356 - 00:32:00.948, Speaker B: Yeah, it should be in a month or two or three. Yeah, fairly soon.
00:32:01.084 - 00:32:48.520, Speaker A: I'm super excited about it. Interested to see how it blossoms. Awesome. I'm also like, so in your conference, your multicoin summit, one thing that you were particularly highlighted was social and creators. And I know you've even touched upon social tokens. I'm curious just how you think about social creator monetization and still holistically how you're thinking about social tokens, because I find those very interesting and I'm curious to, yeah, see your opinions on them.
00:32:53.140 - 00:33:44.100, Speaker B: My intuition is that human greed dictates they must exist. I think because having people count fan followers on Instagram and Twitter and whatever as a proxy for status and wealth, crypto seems to be just the very direct financialization of that core behavioral need. So I think you can map all seven deadly sins to map to social tokens. Somehow that usually feels like a pretty good thing to invest in. I love the theory of them. Well, correction, the theory that they should work to me seems right. For those reasons.
00:33:44.100 - 00:34:25.330, Speaker B: None of them have worked so far in practice at all. Like, they're just in a complete and total flopped. So we haven't found the right behavioral mechanisms to unlock here. And some norms need to be established, which will take some time because obviously it's very prone for manipulation. A lot of bad behavior is obvious around them. People need to develop, both the people who issue them and asset issuers need to develop the norms of what to say and don't say and how to manage that. And then obviously buyers need to understand how to think about them too.
00:34:25.330 - 00:35:06.694, Speaker B: Those things take time to develop, and that's an iterative process and cycle in the same way that people's behaviors have changed. People who used to post on Twitter, I ate a donut and that was dumb. Now people don't post that anymore. So that needs to happen. There's some interesting things, and there's two theories of how that does happen. One is some startups work with new musicians or artists or whatever, and they cleverly incorporate that into their brand and whatever they do and adventure takes off and they become famous and talk about it and stuff. That seems like a fairly reasonable probability that that will happen.
00:35:06.694 - 00:35:17.670, Speaker B: The other way it happens is someone like Elon Musk just starts fucking tweeting, please go buy Elon coin or whatever, which also may happen, right? That doesn't seem very improbable.
00:35:17.790 - 00:35:22.126, Speaker A: I mean, now that he bought Twitter. I think he has a little bit more leeway.
00:35:22.278 - 00:35:43.024, Speaker B: Yeah. And he doesn't care what the SEC has to say. And so. And if he does that, that could immediately spark a social movement. And then every celebrity is gonna be like, oh, what do I do? So I think both can happen. I'm fairly optimistic one of those two routes will happen.
00:35:43.152 - 00:36:07.634, Speaker A: That makes sense. Yeah, I've heard. I personally am a fan also of the social tokens. I'm curious just, I mean, you kind of remove the legality standpoint, but how they work out. I've heard the counterargument for those being embodied with nfts, but I would still like just strictly the coin to happen as well.
00:36:07.802 - 00:36:28.434, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just simpler. It concentrates liquidity. It's a shelling point. The problem with nfts is, which NFT do I buy? And it's just like, okay, this guy released 500 nfts for whatever, and then six months later, it releases more, and it's like, now you have so many choices to make with Elon coin. It's just like, okay, go hit the buy button. That's it.
00:36:28.562 - 00:36:30.410, Speaker A: When are we all aping Elon coin?
00:36:30.490 - 00:36:44.670, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. Right. So it's a chilling point. Obviously, people talk about market cap in a different way. I think talking about market cap is like, will be one of the core behaviors that happens around this. I have a higher market cap than you do.
00:36:44.670 - 00:36:54.360, Speaker B: People count Twitter followers, Instagram followers, and TikTok followers. And so I think this will just be another one of the, the public social measures of status.
00:36:55.220 - 00:37:22.530, Speaker A: Yeah, we like to play those games, so. No, totally makes sense. Yeah. And we kind of touched upon, I think, nfts at the beginning. One of the big things that I was surprised by during Defi summer when all the composability was going on in 2020, I was like, this is happening. We're finally going back. Normies are going to adopt it.
00:37:22.530 - 00:38:01.870, Speaker A: But they really didn't. At least not in the way that I thought, where I was trying to get friends to use Uniswap or do something on comp. But it wasn't until really personally Solana, where the gas fees were cheap and my Normie friends could actually buy nfts that weren't prohibitively expensive, where they actually got into blockchain much more than defi. So I thought that was very interesting. I'm curious how you think nfts have played a role in culture or just how they've carried the space.
00:38:03.810 - 00:38:56.060, Speaker B: Yes, a few comments. One, I think my most generalized mental model for NFT is, is they represent the financialization of culture, of cultural capital, and that's one mental model of them. Second kind of comment is just like, people like gambling a lot, and so that's fun. And like, nfts are a cool new form of gambling. I don't know, why is this ape worth more than the safe? That's not a question I'm qualified to answer, but I guess a lot of people think that's fun. So there's that. And then these NFT community seem to be a shelling point for just people to bullshit about something on the Internet.
00:38:56.060 - 00:39:48.862, Speaker B: You go to the discourse for any of these things and reddits, and there's just all kinds of weird stuff, right? And it's kind of entertainment, it's kind of a shelling point. We all have something in common and there's something to that. There's clearly something there. If you meet a guy at a bar and they happen to be from the same town you were from and like the same sports team, it's just like, okay, immediate kind of shared bonding or connection. So kind of same thing here. What I really want to see is I want to see some nfts get used for more things that tie to the real world more. So, for example, seeing museums issue nfts or something would be cool.
00:39:48.862 - 00:40:18.380, Speaker B: Seeing artists use nfts, musicians in particular would be very cool. Creating some sort of large social game experiment thing around nfts would be cool. Like, hey, get these pictures together and something happens. I think this design space to combine money and social coordination in a permissionless way is very, very cool. I think nfts will really, a lot of that will happen via nfts.
00:40:18.540 - 00:41:10.640, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense. I've been shocked by it all. And it's cool to watch it unfold, whether it's gambling or friends that you make online in different communities. So it's definitely interesting to watch it unfold. One of the things that I also found super interesting was you're a Twitter game, and I'm so very confused by Twitter holistically, but I think you do a good job of finding the answers that you're looking for. Could you kind of touch upon, I think you've described it as Cunningham's law, but kind of touch upon how you use Twitter and just kind of how you think about it.
00:41:11.020 - 00:41:21.120, Speaker B: Yeah. So how use Twitter has evolved over time? I think it was more important to be more divisive when we were smaller.
00:41:22.300 - 00:41:25.340, Speaker A: Would you still recommend that for new people?
00:41:25.380 - 00:42:02.944, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely. It is a very effective strategy. It works for the same reason that all press is good press works. So. Yes, but it's kind of changed over time. Today I think I look at Twitter primarily as a place to share threads and longer form thinking on some set of ideas, but it's not long form enough to make it to a blog post. So I really enjoyed for that.
00:42:02.944 - 00:42:40.780, Speaker B: I don't do it very much anymore, but I enjoy it. But actually my favorite thing is actually just responding to people. People post all kinds of stuff and a pretty huge percentage, I'd say 80% plus of my tweets are responding to people who either ask a question or are posting something interesting. I generally, I really enjoy that. That's less effective for garnering new followers, but I really enjoy it and. Yeah, and now it's just kind of a, it's just like a fun hangout place. But the intellectual stimulation from Twitter is like off the charts.
00:42:41.880 - 00:42:46.140, Speaker A: Yeah, there's, I mean, both good and bad.
00:42:46.480 - 00:42:47.260, Speaker B: Yes.
00:42:48.240 - 00:44:00.590, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting, the reply guys. I think it's interesting as the space continues to grow larger, the different academies of people that have thought about the space a lot and continue to grow in their more nuanced opinions versus people that just bought their first NFT and learning about nfts and how to move their money from in exchange to a wallet. Yeah. But nonetheless, it's interesting touching upon that when you kind of view, say, Doon analytics on the most popular dapps, I think Opensea is maybe one or 2 million, only a couple million people that have ever interacted with Opensea. And then uniswap, I think is the most popular on ETH with like three or 4 million people or contracts are addresses that have ever interacted with a contract. How do you think we go from low millions to hundreds of millions and billions? Is it just continuing to scale the layer one blockchains and L2s?
00:44:01.930 - 00:44:24.022, Speaker B: Yeah, developers to build stuff that people want to use. I think the way we get from low single digit millions to hundreds of millions is probably via big companies leveraging these things. I mean, Facebook has said they're going to launch Instagram nfts fairly soon.
00:44:24.126 - 00:44:25.558, Speaker A: Have they said which platform?
00:44:25.734 - 00:44:54.050, Speaker B: They have not announced which platform or platforms. I think it's much more likely to be the latter than the former. So once that happens, a lot more people are going to get access to nfts. PayPal has been flirting with crypto for a while. Twitter has been flirting with crypto for a while. Square he renamed the company. All these things are happening.
00:44:54.050 - 00:45:08.302, Speaker B: I think those guys will roll out crypto in a meaningful way in their mainstream applications in the not too distant future. I think that's going to be a big. We still haven't had that moment happen yet, but I think it'll happen in the fairly near future.
00:45:08.486 - 00:45:15.966, Speaker A: Do you think those new users will have to understand private key management or do you think those big companies will abstract that away?
00:45:16.118 - 00:45:17.410, Speaker B: It'll be abstracted.
00:45:17.950 - 00:45:26.502, Speaker A: Do you think they'll still be able to interact with other Dapps if they want to, or is it just going to be a sandbox?
00:45:26.606 - 00:45:34.088, Speaker B: I think most of these environments will be fairly sandboxed, yeah. I think they're going to try and keep the experience constrained.
00:45:34.254 - 00:45:58.080, Speaker A: Cool, I think. One other thing I have also appreciated about multicoin is just how you approach investing from the market team and product standpoint. And I believe it's market first. Can you touch upon that? Because I think that's different than other firms and how they approach it.
00:46:00.590 - 00:46:41.750, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's actually this old Marc Hendricks sa. It's like 15 years old or something. And it says, what should VC's focus on? Market, product or team? And he answers conclusively. The answer is market. And he primarily is, which I agree with, although for a little bit different reasons than what he suggests, actually with more pointed views. The smart people in a bad market, like, sorry, the market sucks, okay, nothing's going to happen. So we spend all our time there.
00:46:41.750 - 00:47:53.610, Speaker B: Product I generally don't care about, I think is by far the least important because product is you can assess it at this moment in time. You can kind of assess how much have they built, how fast? But I don't find it to be a super useful framework for making investments. When we think about market, what we really focus on is market structure understanding. Okay, look, people are trying to solve this problem somehow today. There's probably some incumbents somewhere. So what are those incumbents missing? And why are they structurally or unable or unwilling to compete with this new thing? Because not every guy's going to launch a new thing are going to hear about it, so why don't they squash him? What we've discovered is with some investments we can develop a pretty high degree of conviction that incumbents won't respond and that the new thing can be very asymmetric to the old things and develop conviction on that happening. So we spent almost all of our time debating the realities of the market structure.
00:47:54.030 - 00:47:59.398, Speaker A: That goes back to thesis and being more written within the firm.
00:47:59.534 - 00:48:00.262, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:48:00.366 - 00:48:25.430, Speaker A: Gotcha. Gotcha. I think it's super interesting. Yeah. Maybe on kind of tying it back to Solana when I was there. I recently went to Spain to the avalanche event, and I think I was the biggest lana bull there. A lot of people.
00:48:26.410 - 00:48:29.350, Speaker B: Were you wearing green or purple or were we wearing red?
00:48:29.890 - 00:48:31.498, Speaker A: I was neutral. I was neutral.
00:48:31.594 - 00:48:31.906, Speaker B: All right.
00:48:31.938 - 00:49:25.400, Speaker A: Wearing black. I tried to, I don't know, I expressed my opinions on the different nuances, but, yeah, I think I was the biggest lana pull there. But the main callouts that people when I spoke to, one were like the size of the nodes, two was like the number of nodes, and then three was downtime. I think you can kind of negate the last one on the downtime. Like, bugs happen, you fix them and move on. But one interesting conversation that I saw you have was with Cain and kind of like debating or talking about the differences between, like, an eth node and solana node. Could you, like, retouch upon that topic? Because I don't think very many people understand those subtle differences of, like, what it actually takes to run an ethereum node versus a solana node and how minute some of those differences can be.
00:49:26.820 - 00:50:35.360, Speaker B: Sure. The question is, what are you designing a system for? As you add more nodes to a system, then you increase the probability that if World War three, that at least one copy survives, you make it harder for there to be collusion for disordering transactions or whatever. That's really about it, actually. The second thing I described is really a function of the stake distribution, not the node count. Our view has been that you should not optimize for making that number of nodes go as high as possible. I think the value to society across kind of all of these related dimensions is logarithmic with number of nodes is the x axis. That's fairly high conviction view.
00:50:35.360 - 00:51:24.900, Speaker B: In my view, assuming that's the case, then it's okay that you can't run a node on your laptop. There are 7 billion people in the world, 8 billion people in the world. You can just assume some of them are running it. That's a valid assumption. And so I like optimizing along that, that basic reality, the ETH people prioritize, and bitcoin people prioritize running a note on a raspberry PI or on a laptop or something, which is nice for ideological reasons, if you want to say it, but I don't understand what you're gaining from it.
00:51:26.440 - 00:52:06.930, Speaker A: Makes sense. Cool. I think we kind of touched upon a lot of the things that I was personally interested in. One of the things that I think is still kind of developing as large is bridges. And I think you touched upon that with layer zero. How do you see bridges kind of coming to be within these different blocks, ecosystems and the role that bridges can kind of play to increase scalability as a whole.
00:52:07.590 - 00:53:05.452, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's definitely a pretty meaningful probability that you have a handful of networks that have the majority of activity happening on them. If that's true, then you will want those people to talk to each other. You're going to need bridges. There's two probably major functions to think about here. One is arbitrary message relaying the state of one chain to the validators in other chain so they can verify it. There's IBC, there's layer zero, there's wormhole, there's people trying to do zero knowledge versions of all of these things, although none of those exist yet. Then the other approach is to, well, the next thing is a superset of message relaying, which is asset pegging, and that today is primarily run by, I think, wormhole.
00:53:05.452 - 00:53:53.300, Speaker B: And I think there's one other synapse or forget the other one, these bridges all have a lot of money in them. I think none of them are going to go away. I think we'll have two or three bridges that'll probably control most of the value. The thing you don't want is as a user, you don't want to have wormhole eth and whatever, solid eth and something else eth, layer zero eth. Those all on Solana network, because those are not fungible with each other, which means you have to have slippage. People have been trained that when I send you $10 on venmo, you receive $10, not $9.98. And so I think it's pretty important to maintain that ux kind of thing.
00:53:53.300 - 00:54:03.860, Speaker B: It's very hard to see a world in which that happens with multiple bridges. So I'm pretty optimistic you'll have something very close to one bridge to rule them all.
00:54:04.160 - 00:54:27.470, Speaker A: Interesting. Nice. Yeah, I think that makes sense. Well, cool. Maybe we can just wrap it up there. Unless there's anything in particular, like to touch upon or anything that you're excited for in the next, say, two or three years. I won't do short term timeframe.
00:54:27.470 - 00:54:50.550, Speaker A: Someone asked me what was going to happen in the market in three to six months. I was like, honestly, I have no idea. It could go up 50% or 100%. It could go down 50%. I try to think long term, because otherwise it's just kind of a coin flip in my opinion. But yeah, anything that you're excited or particularly interested in the next couple of years or longer time horizon.
00:54:51.650 - 00:55:28.758, Speaker B: I think the thing that we spend the most time on as a firm is, I think this new form of capital formation, that kind of helium first really represented. You got 700,000 people. I think they just crossed 750 to buy a hotspot, do this thing so that they could print tokens. That experiment worked, and it's proven that you can do this for other things. I'm very interested in all of the things that look like helium in that sense. Hivemappers. The next one, which we also just recently invested in and announced.
00:55:28.758 - 00:55:43.530, Speaker B: We've done one more that we've not yet announced, and I want to do, like, 20 more of those. I think this is so disruptive to a lot of businesses and just like, it's good for the world, so I'm very excited for that.
00:55:43.610 - 00:55:54.270, Speaker A: Nice. That makes total sense. Awesome. Well, I appreciate your time, Kyle. Thank you once again. It was a pleasure. Appreciate you having me in Austin.
00:55:54.270 - 00:55:56.010, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you.
00:55:56.090 - 00:56:00.850, Speaker B: Hey, Logan, thank you for flying down here, and this was awesome. Glad to be an early guest on the show before it makes it big.
00:56:00.970 - 00:56:01.970, Speaker A: I appreciate it. Thank you.
