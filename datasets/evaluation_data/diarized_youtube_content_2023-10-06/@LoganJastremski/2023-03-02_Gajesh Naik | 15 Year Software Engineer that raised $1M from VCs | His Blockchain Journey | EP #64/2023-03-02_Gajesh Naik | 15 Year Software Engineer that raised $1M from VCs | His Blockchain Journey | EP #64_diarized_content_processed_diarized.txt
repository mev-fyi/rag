00:00:00.360 - 00:00:11.790, Speaker A: When I was seven, friends suggested me to go to boot camp. Web development, game development. Got know like how to build a game and like a very simple app recap.
00:00:11.830 - 00:00:18.046, Speaker B: Got involved in coding super early, did the boot camp jump from scratch to c, which is extremely impressive.
00:00:18.118 - 00:00:30.884, Speaker A: Somehow they got to know my age and they banned me from the website and kept all the money. Started my new, like, started company. I got rejected with multiple vc's because is this guy like really 13? Is this legit?
00:00:30.972 - 00:00:40.120, Speaker C: Like within a week I raised a million dollars in seed round, like during crypto Bahamas just because, like, people realized that I was real.
00:00:46.300 - 00:01:07.050, Speaker B: Extremely excited to have gazh today on with me on the podcast today. He is a legend in the crypto space and being very young and extremely connected, extremely plugged in, and have been working at prominent companies. So extremely excited to have you here and excited to chat.
00:01:07.830 - 00:01:09.650, Speaker A: Thanks, Logan. Thanks for having me.
00:01:10.150 - 00:01:28.246, Speaker B: Perfect. Well, I think a great place to start would just. Could you give the audience maybe a little bit of background context on yourself? I think learning how you even got involved in tech before crypto is fascinating because you're still in high school, correct?
00:01:28.398 - 00:01:29.130, Speaker A: Yep.
00:01:29.510 - 00:01:41.610, Speaker B: Amazing. Amazing. So, yeah, maybe touching upon, like, how you got interested in tech, how you got involved into tech and then afterwards jump into how you kind of fell down the crypto rabbit hole.
00:01:42.950 - 00:01:48.330, Speaker A: Sure thing. Cool. So should I tell the long story or the short story?
00:01:50.100 - 00:01:53.960, Speaker B: Whatever you prefer. We have time, so whatever you want.
00:01:54.500 - 00:02:32.460, Speaker A: Cool. So when I was seven, one of my dad's friends suggested me to go to boot camp, which was my state. It's a small state in India, and it wasn't really growing into tech back then. It was. It was, like, normal. Like, I, like there wasn't any technical advancements happening, like, back then. And during that time, a company was building.
00:02:32.460 - 00:03:10.418, Speaker A: Building web development, like, web products out of Goa. And they had the idea to bring young generation into. Into tech, and which was. Which came out as Keith Geit, Goa empowerment for information technology. It was led by two people and it was. It was a two week bootcamp. I got to know about, like, different things, like, like, a lot of things at id.
00:03:10.418 - 00:03:38.204, Speaker A: So they, they showed me a plate of, like, what all things are happening back then. So there was robotechs. Like, a lot of things happened. Airship development. So I got to know about these things from there. Like a brief of things. And they were also doing workshops during the boot camp, which was scratched.
00:03:38.204 - 00:03:51.832, Speaker A: Scratches. A drag and drop program. Drag and drop programming language built by MIT. Yes. So I got. I got started with that with scratch. Then slowly I went into learning new things.
00:03:51.832 - 00:04:02.820, Speaker A: Like, I think I started with c after that. And c was very. At the beginning it was, it was very hard to catch up.
00:04:03.240 - 00:04:04.192, Speaker B: C is hard.
00:04:04.336 - 00:04:05.460, Speaker A: Yeah, c is hard.
00:04:06.540 - 00:04:08.692, Speaker B: But I have a big difference from scratch.
00:04:08.836 - 00:04:27.240, Speaker A: Agreed. Agreed. That that was a big jump. Sorry. So after, see, everything was, everything was very simple. So I started to like, learn new programming languages. So I went from c to C, then Java, advanced Java.
00:04:27.240 - 00:05:03.790, Speaker A: I did certification, like, all these four languages. All the four languages, yes, and I. Yeah, and my Java certification was from Oracle. So like, that was like, I was very happy after getting that. Cool. During this, I was also learning robotics game development. I was driving, like, I was getting into these things and look, looking into like, how they work and like, why is it interesting? And like getting deep into those things.
00:05:03.790 - 00:05:57.552, Speaker A: So I changed my industries a lot of times from normal software engineering to web development to just robotics and like, in between also photography and what am I missing? And I also tried ethical hacking, but then I was banned from it. I don't want to mention that incident, but it was very funny. Yeah, this all happened. And then finally in 2020, pandemic hit and I had, like, this. I had a lot of time. Like, there was like, nobody knew how long this was gonna go, but I had a lot of time. Oh, yeah.
00:05:57.552 - 00:06:28.270, Speaker A: I also did data science. Data science was last time I did before crypto. And after getting into. And in September I found out, shit, I'm missing the roadmap. Sorry. Before data science, I also was doing videos. So when I, I restarted my YouTube channel and started creating python videos.
00:06:30.050 - 00:06:47.110, Speaker B: And what spurred that? I mean, because I was looking back through some of your old videos on YouTube and it's amazing that you were able to, one, I mean, you learned all these kind of tactical concepts and then two, were able to teach others. I think that's awesome.
00:06:47.660 - 00:07:57.962, Speaker A: Thanks. Yes, I had like, always this thing, like, so my, my whole, like, my, my dad was a teacher during, like beginning of his, his career, like for a very brief period. Then my, my grandfather was like, doing tuitions, like, back in his time when like, there wasn't like really great education in India, basically the British, like the time when India wasn't like, free. So there's like this whole tree. So by, like, I maybe inherited that skill of like teaching from my, from my parents and grandparents after that. So, like, during, like, I started like, these videos in middle. I also did videos for students in vernacular languages, like in Goa and Maharashtra.
00:07:57.962 - 00:08:17.380, Speaker A: So, like, shooters did have, like, some schools weren't even taking classes. So I thought. And, like, some were taking classes, but students were forgetting, like, most of the things after that. So those, that time was like, the whole idea was very fun.
00:08:20.560 - 00:08:54.819, Speaker B: So ultimately, I mean, kind of recapping some of this, you tried a bunch of different things, got involved in coding super early, did the boot camp jump from scratch to c, which is extremely impressive, probably. Big difference. And then where after trying different things, ultimately kind of wanted to help others learn these different languages, started making YouTube videos. How ultimately did you, like, capitalize on all your learnings and start to get involved in, like, the blockchain and crypto industry?
00:08:55.279 - 00:09:24.756, Speaker A: Oh, definitely. Oh, yep. Yes. After this, in September 2020, I got to know about bitcoin and blockchain. So before that, I knew about bitcoin, like, back in 2017, 2018 when it was going boom. Like, one of my, like, one of the person I. Person I knew told me that, like, bitcoin is a scam.
00:09:24.756 - 00:09:49.990, Speaker A: Like, it's. And, like, then I looked up what is bitcoin? And then I saw, like, the, like, price of one bitcoin is 18 lakh rupees. 18 lakh rupees is about 20,000. $18,000. So. And, like, my, my mentality was, like, in stock markets, like, there is. You have to buy, like, whole stock.
00:09:49.990 - 00:10:11.560, Speaker A: You can buy fractional. Yeah. You can buy infractions. So I didn't look, look into bitcoin back then. So after I attend this, in this webinar, I got to know that you can buy fractions. And I got about, like $10 of free bitcoin for answering the quiz. Yeah.
00:10:11.560 - 00:11:05.234, Speaker A: And later I got, I started digging deep into bitcoin and, like, blockchains, and I got, I stumbled upon Ethereum, and Ethereum just fascinated me because you could enter the financial space without, like, the age restriction, which usually you are, like, you would have some. Like, before that, I wanted to, like, get into financial space and, like, do financial apps. Financial apps, but I couldn't because of the age restriction. And, yeah, there are, there are also other restrictions which, which come into play. So I, I found it really fascinating. I can get a bank account equivalent, also work. So get a bank account equivalent and also, also get in the financial space and learn about it after.
00:11:05.234 - 00:11:13.830, Speaker A: So after getting into. After getting into crypto, I did, I stumbled upon theorem and then.
00:11:15.610 - 00:11:18.802, Speaker B: The Ethereum smart contract. Dapps.
00:11:18.946 - 00:11:42.726, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I started learning smart contracts after that and I built a couple of them. So the first program I did was voting. And I thought it was like, a really good idea. So I was thinking, hey, let's, let's expand it. Let's, let's like, get tabs and like, literally try a ballot. Try to do a ballot.
00:11:42.758 - 00:11:45.382, Speaker C: But that is, uh, yeah, that was.
00:11:45.406 - 00:12:29.222, Speaker A: Just my child mentality. I want to do something. So after that, uh, in, after that, I did freelancing to like, get exposure of how everything works here. And I did it via this platform called Fiverr. And they got to know my age and they banned me from the website and kept all the money they owe me. Then I started doing like crypto YouTube videos and like, I should imagine the description and end of the video that, hey, I'm doing crypto freelance. Like, email me if you want to, if you want to get a project done.
00:12:29.222 - 00:12:58.870, Speaker A: So I did that for three months, and later I thought, like, let's just try building an experiment project. Like, see how it goes. Like in web two, you used to create, like, a lot of projects. And like, I just wanted to do something similar. So I built like, a yield farm, which was, which turned out to be, which turned out to be, like multiple different things. Like, I called it like one stop defi NFT platform. It's called Gar finance.
00:12:58.870 - 00:13:18.692, Speaker A: And it had, it had yield farm at the beginning. Then NFT marketplace. Like, NFT farming. Like, NFT farming was the first thing, like first ever thing, like someone had done. And finally a yield aggregator. Sorry.
00:13:18.756 - 00:13:37.680, Speaker B: And then, so you created like, these smart contract platforms, kind of got your feet wet in the space. And then how did you ultimately get approach or like get into, I believe, Solana, you did it, your like, first internship and then kind of catapulted it from there. Can you talk about that?
00:13:38.060 - 00:14:34.252, Speaker A: Yeah, sure thing. So after doing this experiment project, I, I started looking into different blockchains. And in, in November 2021, during breakpoint, I looked into it, like, even before that, I looked into it during the ignition hackathon, which is I think the second or 3rd 100. And during that, like, the, the developer tooling was like, really bad. Anchor didn't exist or anchor did exist, but very few people had, like, articles written about it or like, how to use it. So after, so in November 2021, I got to know about Solana. I tried writing programs and I wrote a bunch of programs between November.
00:14:34.252 - 00:15:25.640, Speaker A: And so I, every week I used to write a program and publish it on GitHub. So, and these were, like, programs which existed on Ethereum and were like highly used but not used, but didn't exist on Solana. And like, nobody was working with it. So I started like, writing each program every, like twice a week and publish it on GitHub. And, yeah, also, like, during the same time, I started my new, like, started a company or I started a new project. And so the previous one I didn't reach raise anything, just like a fan launch project for fun. So here I.
00:15:25.640 - 00:16:15.016, Speaker A: So, like, for touch, I, so my second project talks, I planned like a yield aggregator where it was, it was a gamified yield aggregator where you could, you could. So how it worked was like, people deposit money. Then, like, if there is like a US ETH pool, for example, they deposit eth. We drive to the best yield source. Let's think about it as like maybe Lido. So we take it on Lido and end of the week, we take that yield and give it to the best. Like, so 80% of it was given to people based on their share and like 20% was given to five random people.
00:16:15.016 - 00:16:43.198, Speaker A: So it was, it was very much like a game fight indicator. And this was a. So I raised like 300k for this from five angel investors in August 2021. And that's impressive. Yeah, thanks. And, like, this was, this was, like, without. So, like, also, like, I got rejected in multiple vc's because, like, they didn't, they weren't sure.
00:16:43.198 - 00:17:38.440, Speaker A: Oh, is this guy like really 13? Like, is this legit? Because that, like, I just raised three hundred k and in. Later that. Later. Sorry. Yeah. Later that year, I met Karav Kariya, the president of jump, and he introduced me to, like, he talked about crossing and they explained me how it, how it could be, like, beneficial for the crypto world and, like, prevent liquidity, fragmentation and all those problems. And then I reef, I just like, re, basically, like, we did like a three hour dinner and, like, restructured how, like, restructured our taksh would be.
00:17:38.440 - 00:18:08.340, Speaker A: Like, it was, it was then, like a gamified cross sharing electric where, like, you would deposit, uh, soul or, sorry, you deposit Ethan, maybe Ethereum. And, like, we find best yield and, like, the best yield is in Solana. We transfer that to Solana and then farm there and like, same process. Uh, and I. Yeah, then in March. Sorry, when was crypto? Bahamas.
00:18:09.480 - 00:18:36.990, Speaker B: Lots of events. Lots of crypto events for sure. So you might ultimately, I mean, you rate you started a company after building a couple applications and then, or $300,000, which is not a small sum. And then you got connected with the head of jump. And from there, where did that kind of catapult you to. To like, internships and jobs in the industry?
00:18:37.450 - 00:18:54.642, Speaker A: Definitely. Yep. So in Feb. I. Oh, sorry. In January, I met a friend from Solana foundation. So, like, I've been, like, close with him since June 2021.
00:18:54.642 - 00:19:47.930, Speaker A: So I met him in person in. In January 2022, and he told me, like, you should do an internship in Solana. And then I messaged Raj, so. Oh, and, like, when I was doing those programs, like, Anatoli and Raj, like, everyone used to agree, tweet it. And I built, like, a whole, like, reputation empire on Solana via that. And, like, I met, like, literally everyone from Solana, like, via that, like, tweet, GitHub thing. Sorry, the public making those programs, like, the program thing, and, like, Raj and Roli and Armani.
00:19:49.110 - 00:20:33.100, Speaker B: Amazing. It's amazing the power of Twitter. If you've never used Twitter before and then kind of get connected with the right people, kind of say some interesting things, it can really kind of catapult you. One of the reasons why I love Twitter so much. And so it's definitely cool to hear how impactful it was for you. But I think even prior to that, just, like, how much work that you put into learning all these things. And I definitely, I mean, no small feat to learn software engineering and programming, and definitely being able to do it at your age, being able to communicate that, upload it in YouTube videos, it's not easy.
00:20:35.280 - 00:20:36.100, Speaker A: Yep.
00:20:36.520 - 00:21:07.646, Speaker C: So I chatted with Raj, and he said, like, let's do this internship. So, like, while building the company, I also did internships. It was from April to July. Yeah, it was very fun. And, yes, and, like, this internship was the second internship I did. So, like, the first internship was in a multinational ship company where I built chatbots again. Yeah, I missed this part, too.
00:21:07.646 - 00:21:17.300, Speaker C: So I was also in AI and machine learning when, like, the previous bull cycle was happening in AI. So I did a chatbot, and, like.
00:21:17.340 - 00:21:19.348, Speaker A: I built a chatbot as an intern.
00:21:19.444 - 00:21:42.080, Speaker C: At the edgeship building company. And then I was paid, like, about rs500, which is about $5 or, like, $10. Yes. Like, Solana internship was much higher than that. So that was a good jump, too.
00:21:44.710 - 00:22:01.770, Speaker B: Nice. And then, so can you talk about, like, anything, or, like, what were your biggest kind of learning lessons that you took from working with the sauna team, doing the internship? Like, how did it change your point of view from, like, a programming perspective?
00:22:02.670 - 00:22:29.344, Speaker C: Sure. Working with the Solana team. So when you work at a crypto team, it's very, very much like you work in a team, Radley. It's mostly like, you work individually and get things done fast. Yes. That was. That was one of the things I realized.
00:22:29.512 - 00:22:30.220, Speaker A: So.
00:22:32.040 - 00:22:35.768, Speaker C: Once that was. So my internship actually started at the.
00:22:35.784 - 00:22:38.160, Speaker A: Crypto athlete, crypto Bahamas.
00:22:38.540 - 00:23:02.378, Speaker C: And they're like, in, uh. Like, this is a fun story. So, um, like, within a week, I raised a million dollars in seed round. Like, during crypto Bahamas. Just like, people realized that I was real. Like, this 14 year is really 14 year old. Like, then I was 14, and.
00:23:02.378 - 00:23:39.074, Speaker C: And then I also had the Solana reputation and the whole reputation on Twitter. Yeah. And, like, one of the investors was FTX. I was in the biomass for two weeks in April and May. And there I also got to know about so many things happening. FTX was truly unique. Like, like, the collapse was not great, but, like, the whole way they managed and did.
00:23:39.202 - 00:23:40.450, Speaker A: I'll get back to that.
00:23:40.530 - 00:23:42.050, Speaker C: Get to that part later.
00:23:42.170 - 00:23:42.830, Speaker A: So.
00:23:44.770 - 00:23:54.190, Speaker C: I. I did my internship 50% in India, 50% in Bahamas. So I.
00:23:57.890 - 00:24:24.354, Speaker B: So, I mean, you ultimately. I mean, did you. You raised the 300,000, you got the Solana internship, which is amazing. You became super popular on Solana, became a celebrity. You got retweets from Raj, retweets from Toli, then got. Went to crypto Bahamas, massive event, and you were. Got commitments for a million dollars.
00:24:24.354 - 00:24:33.060, Speaker B: How did I guess, I mean, all that end up transpiring. Did you continue to work on the application or where did that lead to you to next?
00:24:33.920 - 00:25:06.844, Speaker C: Yep. So I started building. So before raising. Before raising the $1 million round, we did avalanche beta. So back then we used avalanche because it had the best yield back then. And yes, we close that later. And what should I say after that? That led me to FTX.
00:25:06.844 - 00:25:41.044, Speaker C: So FTX actually invited me to the crypto Bahamas. And in the two weeks, I became really good friends with them. And they invited me for three months to stay in the Bahamas. Actually, they invited me for a period, but I chose three months, and I stayed there from June to September. I met a lot of people, and it was one of the best experiences I had till now. I stayed alone for three months, obviously, with people.
00:25:41.092 - 00:25:44.600, Speaker A: So I stayed at FTS housing.
00:25:45.060 - 00:26:15.808, Speaker C: There were people around. I would be very confident to say that I built one of the best friends there. A lot of great things happened at FDX for me. And in July, I started looking at the backpack and trying ourselves. Armadi was right next to me. This was me. This was Arvani.
00:26:15.864 - 00:26:17.980, Speaker A: And like, the backpack, he was also there.
00:26:19.520 - 00:26:40.978, Speaker C: And like, Arvani gave me the invite to the dev group, and I built the first. Okay, not the first, because first was built by backpack, but the non backpack team. Except he was built by me. And this led me to, like, looking into their stuff.
00:26:41.034 - 00:26:41.630, Speaker A: And.
00:26:43.690 - 00:27:22.230, Speaker C: Yeah, it was fun. In August, Defi started to go down. I think it happened even before that. But in August, it was seriously down. And I was very skeptical of the company going forward because if there is a two year bear market and there's a lot of risk towards continuing it. So I planned on shutting it down and refunding all the investors. So, like, all the investors got refunded and, yeah, that was, that was the one of the things I was really happy about.
00:27:22.230 - 00:27:55.080, Speaker C: And then in August, I joined FTX. So I worked at FTX. I learned I was working with the backpack team, so I was building, like, a lot of these xfds and shipping it so that people could, like, there are apps on, etc. On backpack to use. So it was similarly how FTX did serum Solana, so that people can. There is a thing on Solana, what people can do. So I almost did the same with backpack.
00:27:55.080 - 00:28:04.680, Speaker C: So, like, the second largest app from backpack was built by me, flappy Bird and then double diffusion.
00:28:05.340 - 00:28:09.684, Speaker A: It was very fun. Bahamas, I guess.
00:28:09.732 - 00:29:11.180, Speaker B: I mean, so you kind of had a crazy whirlwind from, I mean, your early journey of just being able to teach yourself, coding to teaching others on YouTube, to even trying different kind of web, three businesses with Fiverr, but ultimately getting kicked off with your age, but that kind of propelled you to Twitter and getting involved in the different communities, raising money, which is impressive, and then ultimately kind of sunsetting that, but continuing to kind of further your education, what would your advice? I just think from being the age that you are, being so young and have been so many experiences and gotten to be around such a fast growing industry at an early age, is there any words of wisdom or things that you would share with people your age that would want to get involved in crypto and blockchain industry?
00:29:11.680 - 00:29:15.568, Speaker C: Definitely. I actually have a list of lessons written down.
00:29:15.664 - 00:29:17.100, Speaker A: I'll just open it up.
00:29:18.130 - 00:29:35.630, Speaker C: Uh, lesson number one, everything happens for a reason. So if something bad has happened, uh, like, think that everything is going to be fine. If something good has happened, also that everything's going to be fine.
00:29:36.410 - 00:29:37.150, Speaker A: So.
00:29:39.810 - 00:30:20.910, Speaker C: Uh, in case of any, like, good or bad thing, keep on continuing. Uh, it's part of life. Then my second lesson, this is like, by, uh, like, this has been going from my, uh, like, great grandfather to my, uh, to me. Uh, so wealth, education is path to prosperity. Uh, so just for contacts, like my, uh, my great grandfather was farmer. And then, like, my time, it was like literally, like, very low class. Yeah, almost.
00:30:20.910 - 00:30:27.450, Speaker C: And then my grandfather was a tax officer.
00:30:27.870 - 00:30:28.382, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:30:28.446 - 00:30:34.006, Speaker C: He was a government officer. So that was a shift from lower.
00:30:34.038 - 00:30:44.010, Speaker A: Class to lower middle class. And then, like, this was, like, with, like, the struggles my grandfather did.
00:30:44.990 - 00:30:46.262, Speaker C: So he used to.
00:30:46.406 - 00:30:51.798, Speaker A: You should go from, like, this one, one point of the state to the.
00:30:51.814 - 00:31:14.730, Speaker C: Other part, which took about a lot of time. Then, like, my father pushed it from, like, lower middle class to, like, upper middle class, though, and, like, just, like, pushing this forward. So this was just an example. Uh, another thing is, I'm just scrolling down.
00:31:15.150 - 00:31:17.462, Speaker A: Uh uh.
00:31:17.526 - 00:31:20.450, Speaker C: Never let your ego take over your mind.
00:31:20.990 - 00:31:22.182, Speaker B: Uh, good one.
00:31:22.246 - 00:31:35.950, Speaker C: It is. It is gonna kill everything you ever built. And I think, like, one of the biggest examples was FDR, like, fam. And there are actually multiple examples of.
00:31:35.990 - 00:31:36.650, Speaker B: You know.
00:31:41.580 - 00:32:27.706, Speaker C: Always, like, always be the average in the smartest group. So this is actually, like, one of the advice I would really focus someone on. So in case you are the best in a group, you aren't the best fit in the group. So there should be, like, smarter people in the group, like, most part of the people in the group, so that you can learn from them. This happened with multiple things previously I was in, and recently the biggest jump I read in terms of knowledge was at FTX. So everyone was like, giga Brain. Sorry.
00:32:27.706 - 00:32:42.410, Speaker C: So everyone was a Kika brain. It was like, great. Learn from all of them, then never settle. There is no peak. You have to keep on continuing.
00:32:46.030 - 00:32:49.290, Speaker B: These are a lot of why things to learn so young.
00:32:49.910 - 00:32:50.930, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:32:51.630 - 00:33:18.750, Speaker B: So maybe shifting a little bit. Obviously, now you have a podcast as well. You're talking with the top investors, top builders in the space. How has that kind of transitioned for you, even after kind of the software engineering side? How has that transition been to, like, the podcasting game? And what have you really learned from speaking with some of those podcast guests as well?
00:33:20.290 - 00:33:36.218, Speaker C: Yep. Just for the context of listeners, I host a podcast called the Gut show. Yep. Sorry. So the reason I started this podcast.
00:33:36.274 - 00:33:36.870, Speaker A: Was.
00:33:38.690 - 00:34:17.300, Speaker C: To first expand my knowledge and open source the knowledge they have to others. And talking to them has opened up a lot of things in my mind. So, like, some of the. Like, most of the questions I ask them is about their personal life and, like, how the career, like, not what they are working on currently. So, like, mostly, like, what they did in past and, like, what they've learned from it. And there are some of. Some, like, really common questions I ask is, like, the college life, sorry, the student life.
00:34:17.300 - 00:34:26.609, Speaker C: There are life lessons, some alpha productivity tips, et cetera. Yeah, that's what.
00:34:29.429 - 00:34:58.236, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah. I would definitely recommend to people, if they're interested in starting to podcast, to definitely do it. And you and I had a chat earlier on and yeah, I would highly recommend it to anyone because the people that you get to interact with, the knowledge that you learned, as you mentioned, it's. It truly is different. And so it opens up a lot of doors on that front. You mentioned kind of college and asked them about college.
00:34:58.236 - 00:35:21.570, Speaker B: I mean, still being in high school, what are your plans? Do, I guess, are you going to try to continue to pursue education? Are you just going to go straight into the workforce? Or. I mean, maybe these are some external questions, but how are you thinking about what you are doing? Going to do, just because you're so young and the world is kind of your oyster?
00:35:22.510 - 00:35:23.530, Speaker C: Definitely.
00:35:24.870 - 00:35:26.890, Speaker A: I'm sure they're going to join.
00:35:28.150 - 00:35:30.850, Speaker C: I'm 100% going to join college.
00:35:31.710 - 00:35:33.210, Speaker A: I don't know which one.
00:35:34.990 - 00:35:36.890, Speaker B: I'm sure that will make your parents happy.
00:35:38.650 - 00:35:54.002, Speaker A: Yeah. They also have all of the things happening right now, but college is necessary for some part of the world because in case you want to get a.
00:35:54.026 - 00:35:58.826, Speaker C: Visa, you need a deed, a degree.
00:35:58.978 - 00:36:02.522, Speaker A: And a lot of things that the.
00:36:02.546 - 00:36:12.200, Speaker C: More interesting answer is, like, learning the fundamentals is also good. And, like, some of the great things.
00:36:12.240 - 00:36:21.552, Speaker A: Have started from like, like, some of the great things have been built out of college. So, like, most of the founders and.
00:36:21.576 - 00:36:40.470, Speaker C: Maybe SF have, like, their startups started in their dorm room. I don't mean, like, I'll start one, but it is like, it is a place where you can get good alpha.
00:36:43.090 - 00:37:11.770, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. My college experience, I started out swimming. I got recruited for swimming and then kind of transitioned when I learned I was not going to be Michael Phelps and I was not going to make a bunch of money in swimming to engineering kind of full time. It was definitely a unique experience. I'm sure you're going to have lots of fun, but on the college stuff, I guess going to definitely pursue engineering.
00:37:13.150 - 00:37:14.230, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely did.
00:37:14.350 - 00:37:14.918, Speaker C: For sure.
00:37:15.014 - 00:37:20.810, Speaker B: Okay, wonderful. And then I guess you're going to try to stay into web3 as well.
00:37:21.910 - 00:37:24.158, Speaker A: That's unsure, but maybe.
00:37:24.214 - 00:37:34.810, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. If you didn't go into web3, would there be another, uh, field of engineering that you're, that interests you?
00:37:36.110 - 00:37:37.646, Speaker C: Some of the field, yeah.
00:37:37.678 - 00:37:39.010, Speaker A: That's an interesting question.
00:37:39.350 - 00:38:00.720, Speaker C: Uh, good question. Like, most of the other fields have been, like, overpopulated, so I can't think of one where there's, like, less population. And this is good. Yeah.
00:38:00.760 - 00:38:08.260, Speaker A: Is very overpopulated, for sure. Not gonna say that, but, yeah, is definitely interesting. So.
00:38:13.960 - 00:38:22.300, Speaker C: To which part is there anything happening in other part of the world?
00:38:25.780 - 00:39:20.220, Speaker B: Interesting, for sure. I think one of the reasons, though, why I at least prefer crypto is because it doesn't anybody like yourself or can kind of have access to build, like, cool, interesting. Dapps. But in AI, like, you really have to have a lot of money to train machine learning models, which is kind of crazy. So the barrier to entry is definitely a little bit higher, but it is a fascinating field. And then I guess, I mean, besides, like, web3 and crypto, teaching people, raising money, all the things that you've been doing, are there any, like, things that you do or any sports that you play kind of on, like, the day to day, or are you pretty strictly focused on, like, working?
00:39:21.300 - 00:39:38.280, Speaker A: Yeah, I do play sports. It's been a while. I played sports, actually, so I started playing paddle. It is, in simple words, it's tennis for rich people.
00:39:40.380 - 00:39:57.236, Speaker C: I started that. I started playing that in the Bahamas. And, yeah, I love to play that. And there's also foosball. It's like an indoor game, so not outdoor game. Before. Before all that, I was into basketball, but not really deep.
00:39:57.236 - 00:40:04.164, Speaker C: It's just like, there's a physical education period, and you have to play something interesting.
00:40:04.252 - 00:40:07.564, Speaker B: Interesting. And what was that one that you learned in the Bahamas?
00:40:07.692 - 00:40:10.668, Speaker A: Oh, it was called paddle badden.
00:40:10.844 - 00:40:14.230, Speaker C: Paddle. Paddle p a e. Lithe. Yep.
00:40:14.310 - 00:40:15.558, Speaker B: Okay, interesting.
00:40:15.654 - 00:40:21.290, Speaker C: That's funny. It's very similar to squash, actually. I'm holding that right now. I'm playing tomorrow.
00:40:21.910 - 00:40:29.630, Speaker B: Awesome. Nice. I'll have to check it out here in Miami. I haven't seen any courts. Paddleboard.
00:40:29.710 - 00:40:32.846, Speaker C: It's actually similar to tennis courts.
00:40:33.038 - 00:41:18.630, Speaker B: Okay, interesting. I'll have to check out the game, see if I can learn, but, yeah, I think. I mean, you have, obviously, a fascinating story, and just being able to learn these kind of technical concepts, being able to share them, being able to kind of catapultize on kind of early support from others, which is amazing. No, it's a fascinating story. Just being able to raise from the venture capital side, that's hard alone. But getting to work at some of these companies on the internship side, it's very unique.
00:41:20.010 - 00:41:22.630, Speaker C: Thanks. Thank you so much.
00:41:26.810 - 00:41:59.640, Speaker B: I guess. Yeah, maybe. Closing thoughts. Is there anything that you would recommend to others or advice that you would give? I know you kind of gave your words of wisdom and life advice, but any particular things that you would tell people your age on, like getting involved in web3 or crypto or taking a chance on yourself? Any words of wisdom that you give to classmates?
00:42:01.110 - 00:42:01.890, Speaker A: Hmm.
00:42:07.150 - 00:42:09.930, Speaker C: I would actually say the same what I said before.
00:42:11.150 - 00:42:43.730, Speaker A: That's actually the advice I would give to everyone. Like, those were the advice I would give to everyone. If someone is interested in getting into engineering that advice, I can also give it, but I'm not sure if this still works. Get into, like, learn crypto. Get in a dao and just start, like, sorry. Learn.
00:42:46.150 - 00:42:58.290, Speaker C: Like, something very tough, maybe see or rushed. Then start testing your skills by writing a lot of programs like select a blockchain.
00:42:58.330 - 00:42:58.554, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:58.602 - 00:43:39.198, Speaker C: Program and go to dao. Go to Dao and ask them if you could contribute in any way. And I'm pretty sure, like, most of them are going to say yes. And similarly, similarly, how you do it in a web two, where you have to do a couple of free internships at the beginning. Do that. It's very similar to that. And once you got the experience and first of all, started with our account, start twittering and, yeah, you never know what happens.
00:43:39.198 - 00:43:54.046, Speaker C: Like, three years back, I had only 105 followers, and now I. 35,200 followers. Yep.
00:43:54.078 - 00:43:54.810, Speaker A: Siddha.
00:43:55.710 - 00:43:56.730, Speaker C: And also.
00:43:59.310 - 00:44:02.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that that's all perfect.
00:44:02.950 - 00:44:07.770, Speaker C: Well, read the wall and read Nawal's book on.
00:44:10.390 - 00:44:11.814, Speaker B: Almanac of naval.
00:44:11.902 - 00:44:16.890, Speaker C: Almanac of Naval. We can't read.
00:44:18.910 - 00:44:48.328, Speaker B: For sure. No. Well, again, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I always loved talking with people that have unique stories, and yours is probably the most unique. And I would say it's. I mean, I'm jealous that you're way ahead of me when I was your age. And so continue to do amazing things in the space, continue to kind of put push yourself and push the space forward.
00:44:48.328 - 00:45:01.340, Speaker B: Appreciate what you contribute to the space, appreciate all the podcasts that you host personally. But, yeah, keep inspiring people and looking forward to see what you continue to do in the coming years.
00:45:01.800 - 00:45:05.060, Speaker C: Thanks, Logan. It was great chatting with you.
00:45:05.480 - 00:45:07.816, Speaker B: Appreciate you coming on the podcast. Thank you.
00:45:07.968 - 00:45:08.320, Speaker C: Thank you.
