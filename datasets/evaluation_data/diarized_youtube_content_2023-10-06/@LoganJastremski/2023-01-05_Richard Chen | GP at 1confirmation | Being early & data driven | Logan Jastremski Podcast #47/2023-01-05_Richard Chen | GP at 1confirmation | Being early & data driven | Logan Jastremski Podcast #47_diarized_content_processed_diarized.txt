00:00:00.520 - 00:00:17.518, Speaker A: Well, welcome, Richard. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. As we were talking earlier, big fan of what you have ultimately created at one confirmation, and big fan of what you've done on the dune analytics side. I really enjoy your dashboard, so I appreciate you coming on the podcast.
00:00:17.614 - 00:00:19.370, Speaker B: Great. Thanks for having me on. Logan.
00:00:21.070 - 00:00:59.210, Speaker A: I would love to start with a little bit of your background. I always find everybody's background unique in their journey. The biggest thing that I find is the people that do ambitious things. Other people will often comment that you would obviously have done those things, but at the beginning they're extremely non obvious and often difficult choices. I asked you prior to the podcast if you worked in the tech industry before joining one confirmation and you said no. I'd love to hear the story of how you just went straight into a fund and how you got into crypto.
00:00:59.350 - 00:01:54.220, Speaker B: Yeah, so I own crypto around 2015. This is from doing research in cryptography. And through that, that's how I learned what bitcoin, ethereum cryptocurrencies were for the first time because it's kind of the most natural application of cryptography, and also co founded the Stanford Blockchain Club. And that's how I really kind of got deep into crypto, inviting guest speakers, hosting events, and, like, learning a lot about this space. And I was also consulting for a lot of traditional Silicon Valley venture funds about crypto. This is around 2017, the last bull market, because they obviously get really interested when prices are going up, but it was just really hard to get them over the line when they're not crypto natives. At the end of the day, I wanted to spend all my time in crypto, be a crypto native fund.
00:01:54.220 - 00:02:02.100, Speaker B: One confirmation was starting in 2017, joined up with Nick, and it's been about five years since.
00:02:04.000 - 00:02:39.668, Speaker A: That's amazing. I don't remember how, but somehow I got on the Stanford blockchain emailing list because I was always curious what type of speakers you guys were bringing in. But very cool that you started the club. That's unique. Tell me a little bit more about one confirmation and how you guys started the fund. I've recently jumped through a lot of those hoops. Setting up your Delaware entity, setting up your US entity, being able to accept international dollars.
00:02:39.668 - 00:02:47.160, Speaker A: Tell us some of the hurdles that you and Nick face when starting one confirmation and how you guys went about it.
00:02:47.460 - 00:03:36.910, Speaker B: Yeah, so we started as really one of the first crypto venture funds. Kind of all the funds that came before us were hedge funds that were like trading cryptocurrencies, managing liquid portfolios. But we want to take a traditional Silicon Valley venture approach to backing early stage teams and partnering with them long term. In terms of setting up the venture fund, like admin stuff, there weren't major hurdles I could think of because it'll structure like a traditional venture fund. You do have to be mindful of the RIA requirements. At the time, our Aum was small enough that it didn't really matter. But basically what it is, is like if your Aum becomes big enough, in order to hold liquid tokens, you have to register as an RIA, and there comes a lot of compliance requirements.
00:03:36.910 - 00:04:04.470, Speaker B: I do remember getting a bank partner Washington difficult at the time because it was only Silvergate, I think, and Signature bank that were banking crypto at the time. SVB eventually banked crypto, like a few years later, and there was a long waitlist of crypto funds that wanted to get started and were waiting on an account on Silvergate.
00:04:05.730 - 00:04:47.264, Speaker A: Getting a bank account in crypto is surprisingly hard, but, yeah, I was just curious about some of your challenges. So being one of the kind of first venture funds, was it just kind of a, with you and Nick kind of going back and forth on the idea that because this had not existed yet, and you guys were kind of plugged in into the ecosystem out in Silicon Valley and being in the bay, that this was just like a natural thing that you wanted to do? I think to me, it's very impressive that you just went straight out of undergrad and just was like, hey, I can run this fun, and I will do it very successfully. So I would love to learn a little bit more about the mindset that you guys were in when you decided to start the fund.
00:04:47.312 - 00:05:37.860, Speaker B: Yeah, the reason we structure as venture. Well, there's a couple reasons. First, I think the risk reward of crypto is very much like venture, is like people make the mistake because these things are liquid and have ticker symbols that they should be traded. But really, it's like a lot of these projects, it's like either 100 x or zero. And that's kind of the risk reward you have in a venture portfolio, where you make a lot of contrarian asymmetrical bets. A lot of them will go to zero, but if you hit an open sea, then you return your fund many, many times over. And the other reason is, the problem we saw with hedge funds is there's a lot of misaligned incentives between GPS and LP's, especially during a bear market, because in hedge funds, you get paid carry annually.
00:05:37.860 - 00:06:19.020, Speaker B: So in a bull market, the GPs, the investors get paid a lot of carry because the fund is up a lot on paper, but then during a bear market, they lose their LP's money, but there's no way to claw back the carry. It's not a good incentive structure when the gps have made a lot of money but have ended up losing their LP's money when things come crashing down in a bear market and venture fund avoids that issue because you're paid your carry. When you distribute money back to LP's, you're not paid carry annually.
00:06:21.160 - 00:06:41.302, Speaker A: Yeah, the two different fund structures are definitely interesting and it's been super fascinating to me just watching these new fun spin up and even myself going through like a lot of these learning curves. It's not as sexy as people would like to think that it is. There's a lot of challenges.
00:06:41.326 - 00:06:54.400, Speaker B: Yeah. The biggest surprise, I tell people, is you probably spend upwards to 50% of your time on fund admin stuff. Aside from investing. That's always a big surprise for a lot of new managers.
00:06:55.740 - 00:07:26.192, Speaker A: Definitely maybe going a little bit forward. You mentioned Opensea and how one big investment for the firm can ultimately return AuM multiple times over. Can you talk about a little bit about what you saw in that 2018 or 2017 timeframe when you made that Opensea investment and what got you so excited about the OpenSea team?
00:07:26.256 - 00:07:54.310, Speaker B: Yeah. So it was April 2018. This was right when OpenSea was coming out of YC, the winter batch. I knew one of the co founders, Alex Satallah, from college, and this is also around the time cryptokitties was a big thing. NFTS was this new asset class, and it was really obvious that there should be a marketplace for trading cryptokitties and nfts. And at the time there were two main competitors. It was Opensea and Rarebits.
00:07:54.310 - 00:08:42.470, Speaker B: And the Rarebits team was a lot more polished and had a better resume. They were ex Zynga, ex Farmville founders. They raised a lot more money from VC's than Opensea. But what I liked about the OpenSea team is they were a lot more nimble and scrappy and they did a good job hustling, living inside of discords, like understanding all these new NFT projects and communities, getting them listed quickly on Opensea and just out executed rare bits. And that's why I really liked about the OpenSea foundries, how quickly and crypto native they became and had a really unique perspective on navigating the NFT space. And ultimately rarebits shut down in early 2020 and Opensea is the company we know today.
00:08:44.050 - 00:09:52.682, Speaker A: Pretty wild story. I always love, I mean, the teams and even internally, what I really strive to do is the number of iterations and how quickly you can do those iterations and really being on the ground floor of the ecosystem. And I think if you can combine those two, iterate very quickly and kind of be plugged in. As you mentioned, it is a recipe for success. I also joined in the 2017 timeframe, but ultimately went the product route instead of the fund. But I think everybody or a lot of people that did not leave the ecosystem during the 2018 kind of downturn and bear market of the past couple of years were rewarded. Could you talk about, I mean, now that we're kind of experiencing that another bear market kind of 2018 type style in many regards, how would you describe kind of today and where we're at and maybe even expand upon it in like the past year and kind of how you and the one confirmation team are thinking about it today.
00:09:52.746 - 00:10:42.010, Speaker B: Yeah. Like how this bear market is different from 2018. I say this time around, there's like, actually a lot of, there's tangible products you can use is like, 2018 bear market is like, that was like after the whole ICO white paper fluff. And then like, during the bear market, like, you had to explain to the skeptics, oh, like, these things are possible to build, but now, today, there's actually unisoft that you can point to things that actually work and have usage. I guess what's different this time as well is crypto is a lot more macro correlated. So you could argue that this bear market also has a large part to do with Fed increasing interest rates, tech stocks also doing poorly. And then crypto is just like even far further out on the risk curve.
00:10:42.010 - 00:10:53.770, Speaker B: So I think as crypto gets more like institutional adoption, it just naturally becomes more correlated with the Nasdaq, for example.
00:10:55.630 - 00:11:07.520, Speaker A: Yeah, 2018 was funny. I mean, the fact that there were so many kind of icos back then and a lot of like, I don't even think Dai was or just kind of emerging.
00:11:07.560 - 00:11:18.420, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Maker was December 2017 and that was like single collateral die, which is called like, psy today because MCD didn't happen until like, Defcon 2019.
00:11:20.160 - 00:11:41.650, Speaker A: So you couldn't even really like, hold stable coins or. Well, there was tether. But yeah, it was much different landscape today. And so I very much agree that today is much better in the sense that we actually have usable products that people can use and transact on chain that bring some amount of value.
00:11:42.270 - 00:11:51.130, Speaker B: USDC, I think was like late end of 2018 when USDC came out. So single collateral Dai preceded USDC.
00:11:52.230 - 00:12:38.564, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, all times back then. Lots of funny stories from 2017, 2018 going forward, though. I mean, going back to kind of some of the things that you've been working at, one confirmation, you're very prolific in doing analytics. Me and my product background is very much of a demure of being able to look at analytics, see how much product adoption, the, whatever protocol is getting, seeing the number of users. Could you talk about why you got interested in Dune and how you kind of became kind of a pointed or trusted person in the ecosystem with the dashboards that you've created?
00:12:38.612 - 00:13:26.518, Speaker B: Yeah, so prior to June, I actually had to build my own website, analytics websites using Etherscan's API. So I had to build the whole infrastructure, plumbing. And there's still a website I maintained today, Nexustracker IO, which is the dashboard for Nexus Mutual, that was built before Dune existed. And then Dune came out late 2019, and it just saved me a lot of time because they decoded all of the on chain event logs into really cleanly formatted SQL tables. So it just saved me a lot of time and it was a really good product. So I began using it to track KPI's for our portfolio companies as well as ecosystem projects. I think ultimately it's just because I was early to Dune, which is why my dashboards went viral.
00:13:26.518 - 00:13:51.660, Speaker B: Not necessarily that they were, like, super amazing, like Opensea, for example. I built the first Opensea dashboard, which is why that has the number of stars it does today. But there's a lot more June Wizards now that I've built more granular customized opensea dashboards. But, yeah, it was a good tool at the time, and I was an early user.
00:13:53.280 - 00:14:20.816, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the combination of, I mean, again, being early, it's not necessarily easy to kind of identify products that are coming up and then also kind of being prolific enough and kind of those skills to add value to the community. And so I think having those dashboards and seeing them kind of take on a life of their own has, I'm sure, been rewarding.
00:14:20.888 - 00:14:39.850, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I didn't even think that, like, dune, like, how big the community would grow to where it is today, that Dune would host a conference, Dunecon, in Berlin. At the time, it was just a really good product, a really good tool, and that's why I just used it without really thinking much.
00:14:41.230 - 00:15:50.308, Speaker A: I think my claim to fame with Dune is I just have my username, but I have not gone into the weeds as much as I should have on the analytics dashboards, or at least creating them. I think one thing, two things that I really enjoyed about your dashboards, specifically on the Opensea side and also defi users over time, is just seeing user adoption. A lot of these protocols have had either large volumes or a lot of TVL. But specifically one of the main reasons why I got super excited about web3, Washington opening these financial primitives and self custody to the world. When you look at some of these dashboards, they still have very few users. Could you talk about some of the things, one, I think, or some of your thoughts on users and web3 adoption, and then two, just other general KPI's that you and the team look at?
00:15:50.324 - 00:17:16.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I can talk about the deFi users dashboard that was actually inspired by the bet that, uh, Jimmy Song and Joe Lubin made in consensus 2018, where Jimmy Song is a famous bitcoin Maximus and said that there will be no Ethereum dapp that has more than 100,000, like, I think, monthly active users or something. So like, I built that dashboard to track it and I think the lesson from that is like, people underestimate exponential growth, is like, you can see back in like 2018 2019, there were probably only maybe 10,000 total addresses that have used DeFi, but it was growing. It was already having a hockey stick graph at the time. Then you have to extrapolate that out, where if something is growing double digit percent month over month, even though the y axis is small, quickly explodes and bloons out really quickly. So now we're at six and a half million unique addresses that have used DeFi, and that's still growing a lot. And this is also investing in our, in terms of informing our investment thesis, we're a crypto native fund and our thesis has always been focused on products that are selling to crypto natives in the crypto community. A lot of traditional VC's are kind of impatient with that thesis.
00:17:16.950 - 00:17:58.880, Speaker B: They want to see the killer app, the mainstream adoption. But my counter to that is it's better to have, sell to, or build a product that has a really passionate early user base and bet that the macro tailwinds are there and that community grows exponentially over time versus trying to cross the chasm too quickly, go mainstream. And then you get kind of these Fortune 500 companies that might be like lukewarm about using blockchain for their supply chain management. And DeFi was a perfect example where it barely even existed in 2018. And now even politicians know what DeFi is.
00:18:00.700 - 00:18:42.612, Speaker A: Yeah, I do agree. It's been a fascinating to, yeah, as you mentioned, only kind of a handful, a couple tens of thousands or tens of thousands of wallets, kind of at the beginning of the last bull market to the 6 million or so kind of DeFi users. How would you, what do you think is the biggest bottleneck to say 100 million users? Is it gas fees? Is it like the UX design? Is it just making the overall kind of onboarding experience from exchange to wallets easier? I'm curious to hear it's a little.
00:18:42.636 - 00:19:14.640, Speaker B: Bit like all the above. I think UX is a big one. Like, onboarding is still a really big one because to use Defi today, you have to have a self custodied wallet. And there aren't just like, frankly there aren't 100 million people in the world who know how to go from fiat to Coinbase and then to a self custody wallet. So like, the user onboarding experience has to be a lot better there. I'd say that that's like one of the bigger reasons why.
00:19:17.340 - 00:19:40.832, Speaker A: Yeah, self custody is a challenge. I'm optimistic some of these teams will figure it out, but to me that seems like the core ethos of a lot of what we're building, kind of regardless of which chain you build it on. And so I really hope that kind of the self custody piece gets cracked in the near future.
00:19:40.936 - 00:19:41.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:44.600 - 00:20:11.566, Speaker A: So at one confirmation, just being very early in the ecosystem, the team correctly kind of identified Ethereum building and investing in the Ethereum ecosystem. Could you talk about kind of that initial early thesis about like kind of investing in smart contracts and then kind of your thoughts on ethereum today and how it has kind of evolved over time?
00:20:11.678 - 00:20:55.748, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, back then, like, you had all these like next gen scalable blockchains that were popping up and like got funded by a lot of vc's. So like, no names like Thunder, Token, Algorand, Oasis, Dfinity. There's names that were super big and flashy back then but now are kind of an afterthought. And what I like about Ethereum is the culture and ethos. And it really starts at the top where Vitalik is. I like how he's kind of autistic and doesn't care about greed and money, but just is truly passionate about building decentralized tech.
00:20:55.748 - 00:21:30.520, Speaker B: And that culture, set from the top permeates down where you have a community of builders who actually care about what they're building and the culture of decentralization, why it matters, versus getting rich quick, which I see in a lot of other l one s where it's a narrative that's propped up by their vc's and backers. When a bear market hits, they wash out, they pivot to building on other chains or they just go back to their cushy big tech jobs.
00:21:32.620 - 00:21:59.548, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely appreciate Ethereum and their community for carrying that ethos and really focusing on decentralization. It was interesting at that point in time how ethereum kind of did their ICO in the sense that today, even if a newer blockchain wanted to do that, they wouldn't be able to replicate that from a legal standpoint.
00:21:59.684 - 00:22:18.680, Speaker B: It's just kind of the benefit that they got grandfathered in that they did an ICO in 2014, which may or may not have been a security. It was pretty legal gray area. But now the SEC has definitely said that like bitcoin and Ethereum are sufficiently decentralized.
00:22:20.380 - 00:22:56.808, Speaker A: Yeah, they got a lot of benefits from being first, and I would say that still carries with them today. You guys were fairly early to the Ethereum ecosystem. You invested heavily as you started the fund and continued to do so after the 2018 2019 bear market. Has your thoughts in general on the Ethereum system ecosystem? Like have you grown fonder of Ethereum? Has some of your views changed with like the last cycle with like gas fees? I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how they.
00:22:56.864 - 00:23:55.860, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm still like kind of bullish. Like grown more fond of like Ethereum gas fees. Like made it clear that not everything can be on Mainnet. Why we're going to have side chains, roll ups and you kind of pick your trade off based on fees, convenience and security. So if you care less about security but say you're doing an NFT mint where you're minting a bunch of cheap stuff, like for a game, for example, then you can build on Polygon where security probably doesn't matter as much, but it's super cheap versus building on a roll up. If you're a defi app that needs to care about gas, but security still matters because you got a hundreds of millions in TVL. So that's what I like about Ethereum is there's a lot of different teams working on scalability solutions and they're kind of exploring different ends of the spectrum in terms of the trade off space.
00:23:58.080 - 00:24:13.940, Speaker A: Yeah. Are there any L2s specifically that you think have better trade offs, whether like optimistic or Zk or polygon arbitrumous, are any in particular that you think are doing things uniquely well in the Ethereum ecosystem?
00:24:13.980 - 00:25:01.776, Speaker B: So my thesis on L2s, I think optimistic rollups is like a short term solution for ZK rollups. And the analogy I like to use is optimistic rollups is like adding an extra lane on the highway where in the short term you solve the traffic bottleneck problem, but very quickly, drivers figure out how to use the extra lane. It doesn't solve the traffic problem in the long run because it's optimistic. Roll up is only a linear improvement to the gas cost problem that's growing exponentially. So you need something more zero to one. And that's what ZK rollups are. It's kind of like flying cars or like, maybe like, I think Elon Musk's like boring company, for example, like one of those things where it's something that didn't exist before.
00:25:01.776 - 00:26:00.150, Speaker B: And like, can I solve the gas cost problem exponentially? And the issue with ZK rollups right now is a lot of this. ZK cryptography works in theory, but in practice, actually implementing the sequencer or implementing the prover is the big bottleneck. That's why TPS is still really slow, because people haven't figured out how to code ZK circuits and have them run really efficiently. And I think that's going to be a multi year process of R and D and optimization. But that's where I think a lot of the most cutting edge research with regards to crypto is happening right now in the ZK space. And we've come a long way since 2019, and the space has spaces like ZK stuff has improved significantly since.
00:26:02.090 - 00:26:29.050, Speaker A: Yeah, the zero knowledge flavors of rollups are fascinating, and they are definitely a deep rabbit hole in themselves, particularly on the ZK rollups. What? I mean, why do you, in your words, think there's such a leap from the optimistic roll ups? Is it the privacy aspect? Is it the better data compression?
00:26:29.390 - 00:27:08.114, Speaker B: Yeah. So one benefit with Zk rollups is you can have recursion in terms of Zk proofs. So not only can you have l two s, zk rollups that write a proof to l one, you could have l three s. Say the l two becomes bottleneck, scalability wise. Then you can have an l three that writes a proof to l two, and the l two aggregates all the proofs and then writes a single proof down to l one. Kind of the scalability space becomes exponential. And you see other monolithic l ones, like Solana realizing this, that the only way to scale even more is just you have to verticalize.
00:27:08.114 - 00:27:46.780, Speaker B: And that's why there's l two. Projects building on Solana, because once you have aggregate proofs, that's the best way to scale. And also in terms of privacy, like that would be a Zk zk roll up. Like a zero knowledge, zero knowledge roll up. And that's another cool feature. I think the zero knowledge teams are more focused on the scalability and implementing the provers and sequencers before they think about privacy. But actually there are privacy bullets like Aztec that are more privacy focused.
00:27:49.000 - 00:28:21.322, Speaker A: So with, I guess with L2s and layer threes, one of the biggest kind of critiques of them and kind of a, like, talking point of, like, more monolithic chains like Solana is that you can have atomic composability in a single state. Going back to kind of what kicked off defi summer was this composability nature. How do you think about composability in like, a roll up type world with l two s and l two s?
00:28:21.346 - 00:29:02.920, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you can build on the same roll up as, say, like, roll up. That has compound, for example. And a lot of composability acts like atomic composability comes from the MEV space. I argue that's where composability matters more. And even if you break that MEV searchers, they're still going to do the arbitrage. It's not risk free anymore because their transaction could fail halfway through. That's how centralized exchange arbitrage has happened for a long time.
00:29:02.920 - 00:29:57.400, Speaker B: Even if you look at Ethereum composability, a lot of that is in the form of, I call them IOU tokens. And urine was a really good example in Defi summer 2020, where they would take a token, say a curve or a balancer LP token, and just start adding a bunch of prefixes as they add more layers of abstraction on top of that. And you can take those tokens and bridge them across different roll ups. And it's just an IOU for wherever the assets are stored. So in that sense, it doesn't break composability as long as you have these IOU tokens that represent a claim on your LP position, for example, you don't need to have to LP and then do all this other stuff in a single transaction.
00:29:59.590 - 00:30:26.834, Speaker A: Gotcha. Yeah. I'm fascinated to kind of watch this play out and see how it unfolds. I do think the whole design space of layer ones is fascinating to me, and it's definitely something that I follow closely. I saw that the one confirmation team is also at least semi active and kind of polkadot and cosmos. Could you share some of the thesis around those two ecosystems as well.
00:30:26.882 - 00:31:24.760, Speaker B: Yeah, Polkadot is really a bet on governance. So the way Ethereum and every other chain has done governance to date is through benevolent dictatorship. And hard forks is kind of the core devs kind of decide on what's going to happen. Vitalik, obviously, how it can sway things and it just comes down to a hard fork. And sometimes those can be contentious, like 1559. But Polkadot is different in terms, like, they have the council and you can upgrade the network through a governance process that's baked into the protocol itself, rather than having to hard fork the change the chain for every new protocol upgrade. So it was a bet that, like, that's a zero to one improvement for Polkadot and then for Cosmos.
00:31:24.760 - 00:32:20.770, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been investing in Cosmos since 2018, like the ecosystem. And that's like, kind of a bet on the app chain thesis that as dapps kind of graduate from their building on a monolithic. Monolithic l one, they want more control over the sequencer, they want more control over gas fees, they want value accrual for their token. And those are drivers for wanting to build on their own chain. And DyDX is the pioneer in that. There's a lot of projects that are also migrating, looking at building nap chain on cosmos as well. What I also like about the cosmos ecosystem is, I say, the most similar to Ethereum in terms of culture, of a group of people who are really passionate about the tech and the ethos of decentralization, rather than they can make a lot of money from it.
00:32:20.770 - 00:32:45.490, Speaker B: The reason why Cosmos didn't pump other l one s in the last bull market is because they don't have a demagogue leader who can really, really shield a chain and kind of market it to retail. But at the same time, those types of leaders tend to fall the quickest when things go bad in a bear market.
00:32:48.070 - 00:33:31.140, Speaker A: Yeah, two things. I did a podcast with Anatole from Dydx, and, I mean, fantastic what he's built with DyDX. I was super fascinated, kind of following their specific journey, going from, like, a ZK tech to ultimately deciding to go to the app chain on Cosmos and found that super fascinating. And then, yeah, it's the cosmos ecosystem, I would agree. Like, they're very heavily focused on that ethos. I think sometimes the memes and narratives are good. I don't think that has to come from, like, a dictator, per se, but it's.
00:33:31.140 - 00:33:53.980, Speaker A: I think Ethereum particularly, is very good at memes, especially with, like, EIP 1559 I think it's 4844. Like, proto sharding. What do you think for, like, these ecosystems? How can they be better at, like, memes or just sharing kind of some of these cultures so that other people can get as excited about?
00:33:54.400 - 00:34:54.810, Speaker B: Maybe you should, like, I don't know, post more on four chan. I don't know. I'm not an expert at, like, memes. And yeah, I say, just, like, authenticity matters at the end of the day is, like, I like to think, like, memes and narratives are fleeting and, like, they can come and go, but at the end of day, like, if you don't have, like, a good community that's here for the long term, if you don't have a good product, then it gets exposed over the long term. And there are a lot of memes that were really big years ago that we don't even think about today. The link marines, for example, that started in summer of 2019 when Google had a partnership with Chainlink that went super viral for a year or two. And then nowadays no one talks about the link marines.
00:34:54.810 - 00:35:03.770, Speaker B: So it's better to invest in authenticity and products rather than what's the chasing the super hot meme narrative.
00:35:06.190 - 00:35:36.114, Speaker A: Definitely. I think. I mean, so a lot of. Or, I mean, there's many narratives for this last bull cycle, one of them being Sol Luna Avax Luna obviously imploded, kind of had extremely bad tokenomics or design, if you will. But avalanche and Solana are still around. What are your general thoughts on those ecosystems? Do you not feel like they have, like, a native community or is it just the design that you're not particularly interested?
00:35:36.162 - 00:36:27.980, Speaker B: I think the culture ultimately is, like, driven a lot by greed in, like, both of those communities. And you see this now actually, with both where there's a lot of projects, I know, taking pitches that are pivoting out of Solana. They're building on other chains because it's no longer the sexy narrative to be building on Solana. And they also have to be pragmatic and go where the users are. And they also had the issue where during the bull market, a lot of it was, Solana was propped up by Alameda. Their TVL was propped up by Alameda, likewise avalanche by three arrows. And maybe I have the benefit of being an insider and knowing the fraud that's behind the scenes, but all this comes crashing down and gets exposed during a bear market.
00:36:27.980 - 00:36:39.540, Speaker B: So you kind of have to think straight during a bull market, don't lose. Cloud your judgment because numbers going up.
00:36:42.090 - 00:36:59.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. It's very easy to get distracted in bull markets. And if you. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of shiny objects. I personally. Yeah, I like the different. I think their ecosystems are interesting, both of them.
00:36:59.842 - 00:37:58.868, Speaker A: Solana, I'm particularly interested in. I personally like their scaling solution. I think they have a lot of kind of unique properties. And going back to the analytics, I've been super fascinated just by active addresses because going back again, like, my whole thing has been like, how do you actually get users? I wish there was a better metric than active addresses, but yeah, Solana uniquely has continuously high active addresses, which has been interesting. But yeah, there were a lot of bad actors and kind of both of those ecosystems. Personally, I'm hoping that this is kind of ethereum or Solana's moment from similar to 2018 with ETH where it was like 1400 to 80, that was a crazy drop. And Solana's, I mean, even had a meteoric rise from 240 now to got down to eight, which was pretty wild, but definitely interesting to watch those ecosystems developed.
00:37:58.868 - 00:38:09.096, Speaker A: But yeah, I think it's all fascinating. So do you primarily, are you tracking any L2 metrics with, like, you're doing dashboards?
00:38:09.248 - 00:39:01.670, Speaker B: I haven't made any L2 dashboards to my knowledge. There are a lot of other dashboards I track. A good one is there's a dashboard on how much gas is spent on each layer to writing their proofs to l one s. And that's a good proxy for how much activity there is on those l two s, and also for each DAP that deploys on their l two s. It's interesting to track, say, uniswap, for example, or opensea on arbitrum. Optimism and seeing which l two s get more traction than others. So I do track metrics on adapt level and also on the chain level as well.
00:39:03.410 - 00:39:14.426, Speaker A: I think the last I saw, the at least overall percentage of ethereum block space being used for l two s was like two or 3%, but growing.
00:39:14.618 - 00:39:43.050, Speaker B: Maybe you can argue in the long term ethereum, l one just turns into a settlement layer where the majority of block space is for l two settlements or stuff that's really needs to be secure and has to be done on l one. Centralized exchanges, doing transfers, for example. That's where I see the future of Ethereum going. Just vertical integration.
00:39:45.350 - 00:40:11.450, Speaker A: Yeah, it will definitely be an interesting space to watch. You recently wrote some of your closing thoughts for 2023. One of those being MeV that we touched upon earlier, NL two s. What do you think is the end game for l two s? And Mev, since a lot of Ethereum's traffic, specifically over the long term, will move, or ideally move to l two s to have those lower.
00:40:11.490 - 00:41:18.436, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's going to be a big business model for l two s is controlling the sequencer, and sequencer is basically the ordering of transactions. And why that's important is like MEV bots say they're doing front running sandwiching, or arbitrage or back running. They want their MEV, their ARB transaction inserted in a certain particular order with whatever oracle update or whatever user transaction is happening. And they're willing to pay a lot of money, basically, like maybe even up to 9500% of their MEV profits just for the right to do so, because it's strictly in their self interest to pay up all that potential profits if at the end of the day they're still making some money. In the post I wrote, I have a graph on the Tam of Mev, and how much revenue is like, profits is being made every month, and that's only a lower bound. Like the actual number of amount of profits could be many, many times higher. It's just we don't know how to track all those.
00:41:18.436 - 00:41:40.850, Speaker B: And I think that's going to be a significant source of revenue for Dapps and L two s. Like Dapps that are on their own custom roll ups or side chains, or they're built on a generalized l two. So that, I think is going to be the biggest reason why Dapps want to migrate to their own chains or roll ups.
00:41:44.110 - 00:42:06.464, Speaker A: In that world. And as you laid out, if that world exists, do you envision multiple sequencers? Do you envision one sequencers? How do you, I guess keeping the decentralization ethos that the community of Ethereum holds. How do you also work with the sequesser decentralization?
00:42:06.512 - 00:42:42.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's going to be flashbot style, where there's one sequencer. Well, it's one channel, if you will, and you have to auction off the right to participate in that. Arbitrum is going to have their own sequencer, but if you want to be on your own roll up, then you can fork Arbitrum and build on your arbitrum fork, and then have your own sequencer there. In that case, the application will capture 100% of the MVP profits. It doesn't go all to the base layer.
00:42:45.210 - 00:42:47.230, Speaker A: I see. Very interesting.
00:42:50.450 - 00:42:55.950, Speaker B: Yeah. With each sequencer, that's a chance to auction off MEV privileges.
00:42:58.640 - 00:43:21.648, Speaker A: That makes sense. The other things that you touched upon more broadly was ENS. I was not lucky enough or a little bit late to kind of the ENS game and unfortunately was not able to get Logan eth. But I would love to kind of hear a little bit more of your comments on why you're excited in 2023 for just the Ethereum.
00:43:21.704 - 00:44:12.902, Speaker B: Yeah, that was also informed by Dune I the ENS is the big elephant in the room where no one really talks about it because it's not as sexy as a monkey JPEG. But if you look at their KPI's, they're the 10th most called smart contract on Ethereum, which is pretty crazy. It's right there with C port, Opensea, Uniswap, Tether, USDC, these titans. And then it's like Ens, and they're also like the most widely distributed NFT project by far. There's like 600,000 addresses that own an Ens and in second place is like 100,000. So it's like by a pretty big margin, I think. Also, another thing about ens that's people on the outside don't realize is like there's two communities.
00:44:12.902 - 00:44:37.100, Speaker B: There's like the 999 club and the ten K Club, which are like three and four digit ens names. And those are like the PFPs of Ens. And those communities are getting really excited. I think when web3 social grows, those will become really desirable forms of identity that no one's really talking about right now.
00:44:39.640 - 00:44:49.458, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm super curious about social as well and how that unfolds in kind of a decentralized world. What is kind of your vision for decentralized?
00:44:49.514 - 00:45:37.410, Speaker B: Yeah, like token data communities is like one killer feature. And like, oh, well, we're investor than Farcaster, by the way. And like, what you can, like when you link a wallet to your, to your like, social media account, then you can like have like communities based on, like, which nfts you hold, which tokens you hold. And you know that that's something you can do, that, like, you can't do on Twitter, for example. And there's a lot of projects that are trying to build, like, no discords for PFP projects, but I think that's the wrong approach to take. I think it's better to start as a social media and then add that feature rather than trying to go directly as a discord for this particular project.
00:45:40.270 - 00:46:11.296, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm waiting for a social media application to natively take off and what form that ultimately looks like. I think it'll, it'll definitely be exciting to have that come to fruition. One of the other things that you're looking forward to was the generative art space. I'm curious, your thoughts around generative art. Do you have, like, similar vibes to, like, 2018 with Opensea? Like, what? What gets you so excited?
00:46:11.328 - 00:47:29.610, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's like, the way to summarize it, it's a flight to safety from pfps. These pfps were random art collections created by someone that you paid a contractor on fiverr to make this. And they probably don't give a shit about nfts, but you can argue that generative art is higher quality pfps created by artists who actually care about the NFT space in the long run. And you can see this empirically, where in the NFT bear market, the stuff that's performed the best in terms of holding their value are one of one art from super rare because it has the Lindy effect of being minted in 2018 and generative art. And I actually put crypto punks in the generative art category because it's a critical components to Ethereum culture of, like, being the very first NFT project back in 2017. I also say, like, generative art has the benefit of, like, being the easiest thing to, like, cross the chasm with the traditional art institutions and, like, the traditional art world. And I think some of those pieces will be, like, the first pieces that get curated in, like, galleries like the MoMA and others.
00:47:29.610 - 00:48:15.040, Speaker B: And, like, when that happens, then it becomes a kind of defining moment in art history. And that's what you'll be reading about in our history textbooks in the next several decades from now. And yeah, I'd say in general, as an NFT project, you want to become a store of value where eth whales and people who have a lot of money outside of crypto decide to diversify and park their money. And for a long time, that's been art. And that's why I think generative art, which is uniquely crypto native, is the best form to manifest that versus just these jpegs that are more for traders.
00:48:18.180 - 00:49:03.810, Speaker A: Yeah, the art market definitely became a fascinating kind of story. I think, for me personally, I was not as early as you and Nick to NFTs, and I was not super surprised by Defi summer, but I was definitely more surprised by how prolific NFTs became, kind of at 20 at the beginning of 2021, and how much of a cultural mover meant it became. And so the PFP area, the generative art, it was all fascinating to watch it unfold in real time.
00:49:04.350 - 00:50:09.000, Speaker B: The phrase I like to use is, like, defi is crypto for elites and NFTs is crypto for normies. And I think people kind of underestimated how, like, everyday people, like, just intuitively understand, like an NFT way more than they do with, like, amms spawning curves and permanent loss. There's like too much vocabulary for them to get up to speed with, but they can understand, like, you know, buying a collectible, a souvenir and a piece of artwork, like on the blockchain. And, you know, I think also, like, right now, the total market cap of crypto art is only like around 0.5% of the total market cap of cryptocurrencies. And I think that pie chart is going to shift significantly over time because the total addressable market of culture, of just non fungible assets is way bigger than that. I think NFT is going to disrupt every single vertical of culture, whether that's music or gaming or whatnot, in some significant way.
00:50:11.170 - 00:50:26.994, Speaker A: Yeah, let's go into that. So with music and gaming, that kind of started to be more spoken about towards the end of the last year. Could you talk about some of your thoughts around both of those and how you see them?
00:50:27.042 - 00:51:29.990, Speaker B: Yeah. So music, it's kind of going back full circle where, you know, back in the nineties before streaming way artists make money is like from selling individual records and then like, the streaming model completely disrupted that you make money based on streams because music is easily pirated and free. And then now you're kind of going back full circle where it's more of the patronage model where an artist can have 1000 true fans. It's like, yes, their music is available for anyone to listen to for free, but the thousand true fans will want to buy the NFT and artists will make way more. There's tons of examples of artists like Blaux and Ric explaining how they've made way more money from their couple of true fans than they have from all their Spotify streaming revenue. I think that's going to be the business model for artists going forward, is not streaming or touring like the true patronage model.
00:51:32.530 - 00:51:59.606, Speaker A: I was watching Ric and a big fan of his tweets and then started to follow his music because of it, but was always extremely fascinated how he was able to leverage NFTs and as you mentioned, kind of gain a lot of, I mean, be able to capture on some of his audience's enthusiasm for his music because of it. And so it was definitely interesting to watch.
00:51:59.658 - 00:52:43.660, Speaker B: And it's also a big, it's a way for musicians to get started without having to be tied to like onerous contracts with record labels and management companies where you basically sell almost all of your future profits because you're like desperate at the time and like you need a place to get started. And it's just like really difficult to like negotiate out of those contracts like down the road. So I think music NFTs is kind of the very tip of the iceberg for what Soundcloud tried to do is be a platform for new music discovery from indie artists. But this time with nfTs, those artists can actually make a living doing. So.
00:52:46.680 - 00:52:53.240, Speaker A: Definitely, what are your thoughts around gaming and gaming NFTs for gaming, it's.
00:52:53.360 - 00:53:40.110, Speaker B: More of like a feature and like, at the end of the day, like, first and foremost, you need to be building a fun game. And I think that's a lot of, that's the mistake. A lot of crypto gaming projects I've seen make is they think like tokenomics and NFTs will kind of band Aid the fact that the game isn't fun to play. And we're now realizing this, that first and foremost crypto developers are not game developers. And it's so hard in the traditional gaming world to build a AAA game, to build a game that's going to be played over many years, rather than just something that's viral for a couple months and then dies. So I think that's going to be the challenge, first and foremost.
00:53:43.180 - 00:54:17.936, Speaker A: Yeah, it has to be fun. And yeah, I've been, I do think, I mean, just because so few users actually exist or active addresses on these ecosystems still today, more broadly, that a single game or even single artists could essentially double it. The number of active users, if you have kind of the correct formula. So I'm excited again to see more active users bring broad into the ecosystem and whatever. Yeah, and we've seen this in the.
00:54:17.968 - 00:55:22.642, Speaker B: Past where Polygon was an example, where there's this random flower game that spammed the entire network just through a bunch of transactions and there are a ton of activity. This is also ties into a critique I have of monolithic chains is Dapps will grow and learn how to use up all the available block space. So even if you can do like a million tps per second, dapps will think, okay, well, transactions are cheap. Rather than batching ten different transactions into one, I'll just spam those ten transactions and quickly use up all the available block space. So you can think of a game where, say some MMORPG game, where to kind of click on a map or move your character that requires a transaction. If you design your infrastructure like that, then very quickly you can use up the entire block space. Which is why I'm much more bullish on the modular architecture of chains through either app specific chains or through l two s.
00:55:22.642 - 00:55:23.590, Speaker B: L three s.
00:55:27.490 - 00:55:37.196, Speaker A: Yeah. And is it just because the data compression with l two s or like, with app changes having.
00:55:37.308 - 00:55:52.440, Speaker B: Yeah, with the app change, you're not competing for resources with other applications. So, like, uniswap users don't have to get angry about gas prices because this random flower game is like, using up all the block space.
00:55:55.900 - 00:57:02.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I've studied the different architectures a lot. I have a little bit different opinion, but yeah, it is an interesting design space. I do think ultimately, in my point of view, whether you do a app chain or single l two, you still have to solve for the hotspot contention. If you can isolate those specific hotspots with specific fees per contract, that becomes super interesting to me, because then you're not necessarily fighting for resource contention. At the end of the day, it's just about the bandwidth that the nodes have and how much you can actually propagate data to. And so I would frame it a little bit differently, but I think it'll definitely be interesting to watch. Yeah, I mean, I really started, one of the reasons why I started the podcast is because I find all the different architectures interesting.
00:57:02.380 - 00:58:02.310, Speaker A: Avalanche I find interesting. I was actually, at one more point in time, much more of an Ethereum maxi definitely during 2018, 2019. And personally, I just became saddened by the state of Ethereum towards this bull market just because I paid like $1,000 for uniswap. And I mean, I did that because I was getting more value from the chain to do it. But even the fact that it was still $1,000 just made me sad. And so I personally started looking at different chains and their architectures and going, or being from in my past life, being at Tesla, being able to break things down from their first principles and do first principles analysis of each of these chains, I started to try to apply that to blockchains. And the reason why I wanted to do the podcast is just talk to different people on their thesis on why they're building things that they are.
00:58:02.310 - 00:58:25.418, Speaker A: And I found a lot of different nuanced answers from the myths and labs teams, from avalanche team, talking with Zacky, from the cosmos ecosystem, even arbitrum. They're all very small nuances, but I find them interesting in the fact that what they're trying to achieve and how they do it so I. Yeah, I.
00:58:25.434 - 00:58:58.280, Speaker B: Say one thing is like, you know, we spend a lot of time talking about, like, different architectures, like, really getting into, like, the technical weaves, weeds. But I mentioned this a little bit before. But I think culture and, like, ethos is, like, really underrated. And, like, people don't ever talk about that as the reason why a chain ultimately succeeds. And it's mainly because it's hard to quantify. It's like kind of this fuzzy thing that you just kind of have to have, like, a good gut feel for. But, yeah, I think that that's, like, why ethereum continues to be Lindy.
00:59:01.180 - 00:59:48.006, Speaker A: Yeah, Ethereum. I mean, it's funny. Like, I think Solana, in my opinion, is really going through the exact same thing that Ethereum went through in 2018. I mean, going back to that point in time, like, all the bitcoin maxis were kind of dancing on Ethereum's supposedly grave where saying that ICO, the only thing that ETH could do was icos, and it was never coming back. And it was really those core believers that stuck around and ultimately built on Ethereum and the applications that made it is what it is today. And personally, I feel like Solana is kind of going through similar things where in Solana equivalent, their ICO actors are essentially being washed out and the core community is still remaining and building a. But, yeah, the culture is extremely important.
00:59:48.006 - 01:00:13.356, Speaker A: No matter what technology that you do choose on, whether it's an l one or app chain or l two, building that and bootstrapping, that I do think is even a more challenging problem than the technical aspects itself. And I wish there was a better way to quantify. And that's why I just look at active addresses as kind of a kind of metric or proxy to see the growth of the network.
01:00:13.468 - 01:00:56.080, Speaker B: But I guess it helps to kind of have the benefit of being investing for like, five years and, like, seeing, being able to pattern match, like, what's happening now with, like, what's happened in like, 2018 and, like, seeing parallels with next gen scalable chains that popped up in like, 2018 were super hot, but then, like, kind of fizzled out. Yeah, yeah. And like, all the professor coins, there were a ton of, like, professor, I call, I like to call them professor coins because they, like, were research papers that could do like 1 million TpS plus, like, privacy and like, all this stuff, quantum resistant, but, like, never went anywhere because just, like, there was no culture.
01:00:58.940 - 01:01:36.080, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a large difference between white paper and then Mainnet and then mainnet and a vibrant ecosystem I definitely agree. So it's it is fascinating to watch. I think you and I are both aligned that ultimately we want people to use this technology. I think this is the most fascinating space in all of tech, to be honest, and that's why I'm excited to be in it. I just hope to see more users in these different chains. I want adoption. Adoption is important, but no, I really do appreciate your time.
01:01:36.080 - 01:01:55.726, Speaker A: Richard, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Again, a really big fan of your dune analytics dashboards and what you've created there. I hope you continue to add additional dashboards to your repertoire for all of us to enjoy. But yeah, really appreciate your time. Appreciate you sharing your insights. Great.
01:01:55.758 - 01:01:56.270, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
