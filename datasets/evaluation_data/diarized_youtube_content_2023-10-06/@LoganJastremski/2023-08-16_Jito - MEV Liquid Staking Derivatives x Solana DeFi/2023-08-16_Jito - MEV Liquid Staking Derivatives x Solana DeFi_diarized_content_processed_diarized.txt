00:00:25.840 - 00:00:29.900, Speaker A: And we're back. What is this now? Episode three?
00:00:33.480 - 00:00:34.248, Speaker B: Four.
00:00:34.424 - 00:00:37.620, Speaker A: Three, I guess. Four or three.
00:00:38.840 - 00:01:07.530, Speaker C: Episode four. And we still don't have a name, guys. We're getting top tier founders and talent on here, and we still need to come up with a name. But no, we're super excited today to be joined by Lucas from Jito. Jitto is one of the standout startups on the Solana blockchain. They're innovating in a major way, and we're here to chat everything. Jito, liquid staking, derivatives, Solana, defi, and much more.
00:01:07.530 - 00:01:10.282, Speaker C: So we're very excited to have you here, Lucas.
00:01:10.466 - 00:01:16.470, Speaker D: Sweet. Thanks for having me. Excited to talk about all that stuff you mentioned and whatever else comes up.
00:01:17.300 - 00:01:32.480, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I guess I'll just kick it off maybe with more of an open ended question. Logan used to work at Tesla. I heard you did as well. How did you transition from Tesla into crypto and solana specifically?
00:01:33.020 - 00:02:15.030, Speaker D: Yeah, so I did, like, a brief internship at Tesla back in, like, 2015. Worked on the model x. So the. The one with the Falcon wing doors. Did some programming on those and basically anything that, like, moved or lit up on the car and then. So, yeah, I was kind of, like, working in, like, embedded systems and firmware, discovered crypto and, like, towards the end of the 2017 cycle when, like, stuff was just going up like crazy. Like, litecoin was like, doubling in a day and, like, verge and vechain and all that stuff.
00:02:15.030 - 00:03:04.662, Speaker D: So that's kind of my intro to crypto, kind of stayed up with it during the bear market. So, like, 20 18, 20 19, 20 20. Discovered. Discovered MeV in, like, late 2020. I readdeze Dan Robinson's article in the Dark Forest. Basically other these bots that are looking at the mempool and looking at the Ethereum blockchain and seeing what trades are taking place and making trades, and it's kind of like this new age high frequency trading in some way. So, yeah, I just fell in love with that and then ended up writing MeV bot.
00:03:04.662 - 00:03:34.990, Speaker D: That was kind of my, like, first intro into programming and, like, interfacing with the blockchain and kind of just, like, fell in love with the MeV space. There's a lot of smart people working in there. A lot of cool problems. It's kind of just like, oh, yeah, it's a very, very deep rabbit hole. Yeah, I feel like you can, like, you can just keep going on and on about me be and, like, learn. Just keep learning about it and. Sorry, that was kind of the best way to dive in.
00:03:36.130 - 00:04:05.760, Speaker B: I would love to float just as a. To set some context around. Like, I think a lot of people are fairly familiar with the concept of MeV on Ethereum, right. And understand to some certain extent, when they're trading, someone else is sandwiching them, right. And, like, someone is pulling a little bit of juice out of each trade, each transaction. Would love to just hear some of the high level differences in MeV on Ethereum versus Solana.
00:04:06.700 - 00:05:07.680, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. So, yeah, I mean, flashbots is pretty big right now. Before flashbots, basically every trade was going through the public mempool on Ethereum, so you could see other people's trades and know, predict what was going to happen and kind of react to it. And then flashbots came around, you know, basically realized that there's kind of this problem, that there's a lot of wasted blocks based on Ethereum and all that stuff. So they came out with Mev Geth, and then now we're kind of on PBS now. So I think Solana, it's pretty similar in some ways. You know, there's a lot of bots looking for opportunities across all the Dexs, there's a few, like, main differences in MeV on Solana versus Ethereum.
00:05:07.680 - 00:05:23.574, Speaker D: The major one. Well, I guess there's two major ones. One is that it's so fast. Solana has a 400 millisecond block time. Ethereum's like 12 seconds. So you. You know, your location in the world matters a lot.
00:05:23.574 - 00:05:54.210, Speaker D: You know, I think the latency from, like, Texas to Japan is like 100 or 200 milliseconds. So that's essentially like half your slot time on Solana. So you have to be pretty fast. So, yeah, the latency there is important. And then the sheer number of transactions going through Solana is also way different than Ethereum. I think the average Ethereum block is like, you know, a few hundred transactions. On Solana, it's like a few thousand.
00:05:54.210 - 00:06:29.780, Speaker D: And the block times way shorter, just high throughput chain. The other super interesting thing that solon is, like, way different from all the other EVM chains. And just every blockchain, at least as far as I know, is the continuous block production. So on Ethereum, there is the block time, 12 seconds. Basically, you have 12 seconds to build this block. We have all these builders that are building these blocks and whatnot. And basically the highest payer is taken after 12 seconds.
00:06:29.780 - 00:07:01.240, Speaker D: On Solana. It's basically constantly producing the block. So during your slot, your slot starts, you might emit some transactions in that block. 20 milliseconds in 40, 5100, 200, 300 and 5375 all the way up to 400. So that makes the, it's more of like a high frequency trading system where you have to be pretty fast and you can't, like, can't build the whole block up front.
00:07:01.700 - 00:07:06.680, Speaker A: Do you know if any other high throughput chains currently stream blocks in, like real time?
00:07:08.430 - 00:07:24.246, Speaker D: Um, I'm not super familiar with the architecture of other chains like Swe or Aptos or anything like that. Um, I don't know what Monad's planning to do with that, but, um, as far as I know, Solana is the only one.
00:07:24.438 - 00:07:25.318, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:07:25.454 - 00:07:46.010, Speaker D: So it's kind of like, I think that's like, it's pretty cool because it's like more of like a video stream or it's like a smooth video stream versus, like Ethereum. It's like, in all the other chains, it's kind of just like choppy. Like you're just submitting these giant things at one time. Solana, you have this steady state stream of transactions.
00:07:47.150 - 00:08:02.730, Speaker A: In a perfect world, I mean, you'd get the block times as low as latency as possible, correct? I mean, the more me, the longer the block times, the higher the likelihood for Mev capture.
00:08:04.720 - 00:08:26.020, Speaker D: Yeah, we've seen this a little bit. There's a group on Twitter, I think it's special mech or something, and they're showing when there's a ton of volatility on binance, the Ethereum block time, it's lagging like 12 seconds. So you can have really large sextext arb there.
00:08:27.640 - 00:09:15.380, Speaker B: I think one of the main things just building on the monad side in like doing research to understand what MEV will look like on chain when it's up and running on Mainnet, understanding the difference between where the majority of MEV currently comes from on Ethereum versus Solana, I think Ethereum is a lot of. It's a lot of sandwich attacks, but if the main decks, or like the maintain that people are trading is via central limit order book instead, it takes out a lot of, like, the inherent MEV that's possible there, right? So, like, trading super tight spreads on central limit order book, you're not able to sandwich stack nearly the same way that you can on an Am. Is that.
00:09:15.420 - 00:10:03.660, Speaker D: That's more or less, yeah, for sure. I think there's a. I think, like, Solana definitely exposes less MEV and you. We are building MEV infrastructure, but I think it's a reason to be bullish on Solana, is that it exposes less meV, you have better, better exchange technology that you see in the traditional central limit order book world and then you have amm, clmms, all the other stuff. I think another thing is that we haven't really seen any sandwiching on Solana yet. So most mev we see is arbitrage. I think another thing is, as far as I know, most people just trade through Jupiter.
00:10:03.660 - 00:10:23.710, Speaker D: And Jupiter and aggregators in general are the best way to avoid MeV. Typically they don't leave. It'll pull liquidity from multiple sources as much as it can and it tends to leave less arbitrage on the table. So users get way better pricing.
00:10:25.250 - 00:10:55.300, Speaker A: One thing I wanted to get a little bit more into, I mean we could continue down the EV rabbit hole, but just on terms of the amount of stake that you guys have been getting recently, congrats. I think every vc is looking for that kind of hockey stick growth and I, you guys are great examples of that. I think kind of tried and true, just putting 1ft in front of another day after day and kind of grinding on that. It's been awesome to see the recent success.
00:10:55.920 - 00:11:20.940, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, it's been, I think post FTX everyone was like pretty upset and all that. But I think there's a lot of super dedicated people on Solana that didn't let that ruin their trajectory and actually doubled down. We definitely doubled down on Solana. And you're starting to see that payoff now.
00:11:21.520 - 00:11:36.170, Speaker A: Could you talk, I mean for the people on Twitter or Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube that are listening a little bit more about what you're offering with your stake product? Kind of like walk people through the flow.
00:11:36.360 - 00:12:30.290, Speaker D: Yeah. So yeah, I guess Jito Labs builds Mev software and then we're also contributors to Jita stake pool, which is liquid staking protocol. In Solana, there's a liquid staking token called Jito Soul. And essentially it's, you know, normal staking. You're essentially locking up your capital on a validator and you don't have any liquidity. So liquid staking, you basically deposit Sol into a liquid staking pool and that pool will mint you a liquid staking token which basically represents the initial capital you put in plus all the rewards that you get from inflation. Our, I guess, variation or improvement on that is the addition of this MEV validator client.
00:12:30.290 - 00:13:30.020, Speaker D: So trying to make sure that give incentives for stakers to stake to MeV enabled validator clients and receive some of the MEV happening on chain. I think if you look at Ethereum I think a few months ago. I don't know what it is now, but I think the MEV rewards were like 20% of the APY much lower on Solana. But I think, you know, if Defi takes off, then hopefully it'll get there maybe a little underneath that. So, yeah, the goal is to, like, have a super strong validator set, make sure you're supporting good validators and delegating to them, and then also provide users the opportunity to receive some of that MEV. Then it also helps, like, bolster Solana Defi. We've seen the impact of, like, Steth and like, reth or Rocketpool eth on Ethereum and Defi.
00:13:31.280 - 00:14:06.500, Speaker C: Absolutely. I think it's been a major zero to one moment getting some of those lsts fired up. And I think it's something that Solana has definitely been looking at as well. And I guess a question around that, why many people have kind of speculated on this, but why do you think the LSD adoption remains so limited on Solana relative to an ethereum? I mean, there's obvious argument that not 100% of the coins are, like, on chain immediately because Solana didn't IcO. But from your perspective, I'd love to hear your take.
00:14:08.680 - 00:15:01.648, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think there's a few, like, there's a few structural reasons. I think one is like, ethereum didn't have withdraws for the longest time. So if you wanted liquidity, Lido is kind of the best way. And started to see others pop up as well. Solana has a two day withdrawal period, so it's pretty fast to get your stake back if you need it. But I also think that no one's really nailed the messaging for liquid staking on Solana yet. And I think that there hasn't really been any, like, super technical liquid staking products yet that are, like, well marketed and well branded and, you know, kind of lean, more like institutional.
00:15:01.648 - 00:15:04.580, Speaker D: And that's kind of what Jita is doing.
00:15:05.480 - 00:15:09.960, Speaker B: Nothing, I think, from that side as well.
00:15:10.040 - 00:15:10.660, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:11.050 - 00:15:45.972, Speaker B: I would say, for your average retail user who transacts on chain, but isn't necessarily like, a developer understands all the nuances. Right? They understand, oh, I sold. I can go buy an NFT here, or I can trade it for this token here. But they're not truly on the builder side. They have a base level understanding of on chain transacting in their mind. They're probably like, oh, if I have this bank of Solana that I want to hold for a long time, I'm going to go stake it, I'll get my liquid staking token. That's great.
00:15:45.972 - 00:16:27.460, Speaker B: I'm getting some yield on it. But if I want to actually use Solana to trade and buy nfts, essentially trade, that's the main use case on trade right now for a lot of these different protocols, Solana is the core asset that you use to do that. Do you think that a path forward, right. Like as LSD has become more adopted and people kind of see them, like, do you think that people will start to see them as the native asset, like protocols we built around having the core asset be a staked version of Solana instead of just sold a native token?
00:16:27.800 - 00:17:25.238, Speaker D: Yeah, 100%, I think. Yeah, I mean, I think as we see, like kind of going back to what I was talking about earlier where there's a lot of like, super dedicated and talented teams on Solana that are continuing to build more DeFi protocols, I think liquid staking will be as those, as those DeFi protocols come online, they will start to realize like, hey, we can attract this liquid stake Solana and, you know, boost our TVL and usage and volume and fees and all of that. So I think that we'll definitely start to see that more. I mean, I think there's probably even a world where you could like pay for gas and liquid staking token if you want to, which I think would be pretty cool. But yeah, I mean, I think it's like, you know, there's a little bit of smart contract risk. The geo sole stake pool has been audited like seven times. Solana Labs wrote it.
00:17:25.238 - 00:18:07.734, Speaker D: So. Feeling pretty confident about that. But like, other than that, it's like kind of super. It's like superior in basically every way. Another thing is like, there's some, I'm not a, not a financial advisor or whatever, but you should talk to your lawyer. But there's, yeah, not financial advice, but there's also potential, like tax benefits as well because like most of the, I think every liquid staked token on Solana is reward bearing. So if you are staking, you're getting rewards like airdropped or minted to your wallet or whatever the legal jargon is for it.
00:18:07.734 - 00:18:18.758, Speaker D: And some people might view that as taxable, where with liquid staking token, it's accruing in the price of the liquid staking token. There might be some tax benefits.
00:18:18.894 - 00:19:22.000, Speaker A: That's a little bit of alpha there in terms of. I would say I 100% agree with you. I mean, what ultimately you've built is in every way pretty much more advantageous to the end user than just directly staking to a validator. You're also getting those mev rewards. I think the only thing that when I talk with people about Jitto or not judo specifically, but the type of mev collection is typically around the smart contractress and some of the potential pitfalls that, that ultimately introduce to the people that are listening, what comfort can you try to bring them? I know you said you've had the client audited seven times, but is there anything else that can kind of build comfort with people? Or is it just a matter of having the protocol be live for an extended period of time so it kind of gets that Lindy effect?
00:19:22.460 - 00:20:16.532, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think all of the things that you mentioned, I think the audits, you know, I think Solana Labs wrote the stake pool implementation. That's what a bunch of the stake pools on Solana use. I think Lido and Marinade are the only ones that have their own bespoke audited implementations. Solana one's been audited by three or four different firms at multiple points in history. And I think that definitely helps a lot. I think that between that and kind of this battle tested over time thing that kind of happens with these things, I think that will, that plus, like, more TVL into these programs will also make people more comfortable with them and.
00:20:16.556 - 00:20:31.400, Speaker A: Those juicy, juicy rewards from MEV. Is that primarily, I mean, I think you mentioned this earlier, just a factor of increased activity, specifically in DeFi to capture those arbitrages and share those with stakers.
00:20:32.100 - 00:21:03.868, Speaker D: Yeah. Jitos stake pool only stakes to validators running the Jito Solana validator client, it's a fork of Solana Labs. It's been audited twice so far. We're getting another audit starting tomorrow for 116. And basically that has special code in it to efficiently capture meV. It's kind of similar to like. It's similar ish to like, PBS on Ethereum, but essentially it will validators in the stake pool.
00:21:03.868 - 00:21:54.596, Speaker D: You have to be running judo Solana, to receive stake from the stake pool. And there's like a minimum amount of MEV that you have to pass on. And I think most mev right now that we see is like arbitrage. So people arbitraging like orca and radium, and there's like, we're starting to see more people arbitrage and submit bundles for drift as well. So I think when you start having all these, like, you start having all these other pieces that pop up in the puzzle, when you get a new defi protocol. And every piece that's added just creates another node in this graph that you can make money on. So if you have this giant web of things that are connected on chain through this ultimail one, then there should be more mev and then volume, of course, too.
00:21:54.788 - 00:22:55.270, Speaker C: It's pretty fascinating just with how minimal the fees are in Solana. Like some of these strategies that you just mentioned, like multi hops and someone doing an arb for like $1.30. And that's perfectly profitable on Solana, which is kind of wild to think about. But as you kind of think about the chicken and the egg in terms of like more searchers, more TVL, more stake Sol, and kind of that flywheel, assuming Solana, TVL and Defi comes back, which is already showing very strong signs of doing so, I think we printed an all time high for 2023 of TVL, like yesterday or the day before. How do you see kind of like the yield evolving? Obviously, like no predictive statements, but like a upper bound, like, you know, could it approximate that like 20% on Ethereum theoretically, over time?
00:22:57.410 - 00:23:34.240, Speaker D: Potentially. I mean, it's, it's really hard to say. I think it will only increase from here. As we see more protocols and like more validators running this MEV client and more people, like, sticking to it, I think we'll see the number increase. I think, like the, you can, you can like somewhat approximate mev as like a function of volume. So like mev per volume, per dollar volume or whatever. Maybe it's like a few like BPS or whatever.
00:23:34.240 - 00:24:04.820, Speaker D: So I think comparing it to Ethereum, I think it'll be less just because so far we haven't really seen any sandwiching, which is driving a ton of the Ethereum yield. And then also there's like, for what Kevin was saying earlier, like, there's more efficient order books and things like that, that just expose less mev to users. So I think it will go up, but I think like mev per volume will be less than Ethereum.
00:24:08.360 - 00:24:41.390, Speaker B: Which is a good thing too. Yeah, not looking at it from there, 100%, like in a general health factor of the economy of a chain, that's a great thing. I know. Like, yeah, most, actually, I don't want to say most. In case it's not. A lot of the core Ethereum researchers right now are spending a ton of time on mue prevention. That seems to be the biggest, most actionable problem that a lot of the Ethereum community is looking at right now and trying to solve.
00:24:41.390 - 00:24:59.458, Speaker B: It's like, more than anything else, it's captured their minds. Mev is really the thing that we need to nip in the bud before it's, you know, for Ethereum to grow in a healthy manner, which people can have different opinions on that.
00:24:59.474 - 00:24:59.626, Speaker D: Right?
00:24:59.658 - 00:25:48.870, Speaker B: Like, some may think scaling is more important. A lot of them think that mev is really the main thing. And I think that it's probably because of, like, the architecture of how Ethereum works in and of itself. Right? Like, the fact that Solana has less mev per dollar volume is a function of. Of the actual performance of the chain. It is doing as much higher throughput and much quicker finality, which allows you to build things like central limit order books that can operate efficiently if you need to do Amm swaps. And there are 12 seconds to go and extract out exactly the total amount of the MEV from that transaction.
00:25:48.870 - 00:26:06.950, Speaker B: It's a much, much higher percentage of. It's a much, much higher proportion of total dollars being transacted for whatever reason the user wants versus what's actually being extracted out by searchers and other MEV players in the space.
00:26:07.970 - 00:26:33.870, Speaker D: Yeah, Ethereum is spending a lot of time on it. I think it will become increasingly more important on Solana. And that's a conversation that we're leading right now. And we'll continue to push forward in the future. I don't know if we'll get to. I don't know if you can copy paste PBS. I think PBS has some issues as well.
00:26:33.870 - 00:27:10.278, Speaker D: We kind of saw what happened with Tornado and, you know, Tornado got sanctioned. The tornado contract got sanctioned by the us government. You had a bunch of, like, us based block builders that basically were, like, censoring those transactions, or they wouldn't touch blocks with them, wouldn't build blocks with those. And there's a few other issues with it. But I think, you know, something like PBS could. A variation of PBS could make sense on Solana, uh, taking into account the, like, latency and things like that and.
00:27:10.294 - 00:27:13.730, Speaker A: The age old question. Lucas, can you get rid of me?
00:27:15.030 - 00:27:48.070, Speaker D: Uh, no, no. I mean, I think you can. Like, you're just, like, moving it around somewhere else. I think anything you do, like, there are people that are, like, probably smarter and more motivated to make money. Like, it's kind of like this. Like, I can't remember who said this, but it's kind of like this, like, energy in the system that you can't get rid of. You can only move it somewhere else.
00:27:49.650 - 00:28:55.962, Speaker C: Makes sense. On the topic of metrics, I know a lot of people debate what is the best metric for DeFi. And, and obviously, like, TVL is the age old kind of like, power rating of an ecosystem, but it's also a pretty, fairly noisy metric. There's been recently some things published by some folks at Solana and other investors in the ecosystem around kind of like a velocity of money type defi utilization metric, where it's essentially volume per dollar of TVL. And Solana, while having quite a modest TVL at this point, given, like, what's happened and everything and how new the chain is, it has one of the highest velocity of money defi metrics, if not the highest in the world. So what's kind of your take on that and people's reliance and kind of insistence on the TVL as, like, the be all, win all defi metric of the world?
00:28:56.146 - 00:29:52.790, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the velocity of money thing is pretty interesting. Yeah, I mean, I think the more volume per TVL, you could say that that chain's, like, more efficient. I think at the same time, though, I think TVL is, like, one of the most important, maybe disagreeing with them, like, the most important thing. I think it's a very strong trust signal. And if you look at DeFi llama, the chains and you sort by TVL, the further you get down the list, you're like, yeah, that chain's kind of questionable. When you look at Ethereum or the l two s, it's like, oh, there's billions of dollars of capital in these things. They are, like, pretty trusted as, like, a base layer, and there's a lot of activity and trust in those protocols.
00:29:52.790 - 00:30:02.190, Speaker D: So I think velocity of money is another way to measure that. But I do think that, like, high TVL is good.
00:30:03.490 - 00:30:26.630, Speaker A: I know the industry is heavily kind of focused on the current thing, and it seems like the current thing right now is L2s and all the topics around centralized sequencers. Should you decentralize it, fraud proofs, et cetera. Do you have any spicy takes on L2s in general?
00:30:27.090 - 00:31:26.560, Speaker D: Oh, man, I think I have a similar takes to everyone in Solana about them or any high throughput chain enjoyer. It's kind of frustrating having, like, the same arguments or, like, disagreements over and over on Twitter. I think, you know, it's like the same conversation of, like, some l two maxi or whatever saying, solana centralize, and then you say, oh, what about your l two s that you're like, depending on the scale. And then it's kind of just like crickets. Um, it's like the same conversation over and over again. So I think it's pretty frustrating. I think the, like, eth community is kind of, like, compromised on a lot of their vision to, like, push these l two s, and, uh, we'll see what happens.
00:31:26.560 - 00:31:45.950, Speaker D: I think there's a lot of smart people working on l two s and, like, you know, they can do whatever they want, but I think that the eth community has kind of compromised a lot on this decentralization narrative in support of l two s. And that's just kind of like, sad to see.
00:31:46.770 - 00:32:33.170, Speaker B: I love to throw at the, at the risk of getting bashed publicly to try to, like, summarize both arguments, kind of where they stop. Right. Maybe we can add a little bit more color to that. I think the current argument is, like, essentially Solana says that they're more decentralized than l two s, and then l two s say, like, yeah, but down the line, we will become more decentralized. And then at the base layer, ethereum is more decentralized. So, like, at the end of the day, once everything is built out, then we will have the objective advantage. Right? Like, if you're saying how decentralized it is right now, you're taking a short side of you, like, your one data point is today, and we're building towards a future.
00:32:33.170 - 00:32:54.188, Speaker B: I think something that adds a little bit more color to that would be, at what rate do you think l two s will be able to decentralize? And then does Solana outpace that? Right. So if their argument is two years from now will be decentralized, it's like, well, where could Solana get to over the course of two years?
00:32:54.294 - 00:32:54.888, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:32:55.024 - 00:32:59.180, Speaker B: And then if it's still more decentralized, right. Then that's a different conversation to be had.
00:32:59.560 - 00:33:21.700, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think it's. Yeah, there's a lot of, like, ways that conversations are twisted from both sides to meet whatever, like, narrative they're matching. It's like Solana's not decentralized, so l two s are centralized. Oh, people are working on that. Like, blah, blah, blah.
00:33:21.700 - 00:34:18.430, Speaker D: But, yeah, I mean, I think it'll be interesting. I know that, like, Solana from, like, the, like, it gets a lot of, there's a lot of people that are like, oh, you need like a ton of compute to run a salon, a validator and all this stuff. But it's like, that's going to get way better over time. Like, even 116 and 117, the next kind of releases that should be coming online, like, the next month or two are way more efficient. So I think the goal of Solana is to use every transistor and circuit in a computer as efficiently as possible. And they also had to build this plane while they were taking off. I don't think they anticipated what would have happened during the last bull run as far as the adoption spam and Mev and all this stuff.
00:34:18.430 - 00:34:53.170, Speaker D: So I kind of just made the most of it and, like, continued to ship. And now I think they have the breathing room to, they've been working on this whole time, but probably have a little more breathing room to continue making things more efficient, dropping the memory requirements. There's a lot of improvements to make in gossip to bring the traffic down. There's teams working on, like, lite clients and things like this. So I think on that spectrum, Solana will only continue to get better, not worse.
00:34:53.950 - 00:35:20.234, Speaker C: And kind of on that front, you're one of the people, at least, like, you know, in the ecosystem, people think of you as one of the builders that kind of knows the Solana code the best outside of the core. Solana Devs, what's your take on fire dancer and the Solana 2.0 narrative and everything that that's going to bring for the chain kind of, you know, as it relates to Mev and your business or just more broadly?
00:35:20.402 - 00:36:27.294, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, super bullish fire dancer. I think, like, those guys are just, like, cracked out engineers, and, you know, they're, they are thinking about hardware and the embedded system context that I kind of come from, but even more on steroids. Where do we put our, what core do we run this thread on? And where is the memory that it's using? We need the shortest circuit from this core to this memory. How do we keep the processor running at max throughput? Like, worry about all these, the data pipeline, instruction pipelines, and all this stuff. So I think it will be way, way, way more efficient than the current labs validator. I think it probably is fair to call it Solana 2.0. I might get shit for this.
00:36:27.294 - 00:36:29.662, Speaker D: Maybe some. Some angry DM's.
00:36:29.846 - 00:36:32.410, Speaker A: But, uh, let's start the narrative.
00:36:33.550 - 00:37:07.040, Speaker D: Um, yeah, yeah, I mean, I think it. It kind of depends on, like, what validators do. I think, you know, all these networks are driven by incentives. So if you offer, uh, it's similar to, like, the Mev validator. Clients like, hey, run this, you'll earn a little bit extra stake, help the network run more efficiently. Runs more efficiently, you'll see more defi activity, more volumes, more fees, more money, all that stuff. So I think if you dangle the right incentives in front of validators like fire dancer, you know, maybe it'll run on hardware that's 50% cheaper.
00:37:07.040 - 00:37:15.520, Speaker D: Maybe it can run at like ten x or 100 x the throughput. Then, you know, you could see a lot of validators switch over to that.
00:37:16.140 - 00:38:08.678, Speaker C: No, it's super exciting. I think one of the things that Logan and I are most excited about with Solana is just the fact that it scales with hardware, and there's brilliant engineers innovating every day around multicore performance. There's optical gpu's now that are transferring data that way. And even some of. I know it's a meme, but the LK 99, room temperature, ambient superconductor stuff and the potential there eventually for a breakthrough in computer. And you think about all these super clever engineers and materials scientists working day and night to innovate there. And then Solana being positioned as kind of one of the few chains that's taking the most benefit out of those advancements in hardware, which is pretty exciting.
00:38:08.678 - 00:38:32.070, Speaker C: But on that note, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention our sponsor, Monad. They're also a next generation blockchain building a high performance EVM, and was wondering if you had any takes on how that shakes up the dynamic. I mean, Ethereum obviously has a mempool. Solana doesn't. How would Mev on a high performance EVM chain look?
00:38:33.410 - 00:39:08.220, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I don't know the specifics about Monad's architecture. Well, I know, like, bits and pieces of it. I know that, like, Keanu and the rest of the team are, like, super fucking smart. And, uh, you know, I'm sure they'll come up with something great. I think, um, they seem to be like. I guess before I get into me, I think they are like, they seem to be super focused on community already, which I think is, like, super important for these l ones. I think they're also leveraging EVM, which, you know, does.
00:39:08.220 - 00:39:58.930, Speaker D: I'm more of a fan of the SVM, but, you know, the EVM does have a large moat, so I think, you know, leveraging that will be nice. It will be interesting to see if they have to play the ETH alignment game or if they can just get away from that. But I think super excited about Monad. I think, yeah, I guess TBD on what it looks like from Meva standpoint. I don't know, you know, how frequently the leader rotates if they're going to go with a mempool or something else, some other, like, data structure to do that. There'll probably be, like, a MeV company that comes along and builds MeV software for it. I'm sure they, you know, there's a lot of.
00:39:58.930 - 00:40:25.000, Speaker D: There's a lot of, like, maybe not case studies, but there's just a lot of. A lot more knowledge about MeV than there was a few years ago and different things that you can do and the different ways that people are leveraging Mev to, like, extract money. So I think, I'm sure there. That's like, Mev is like, top of mind for monadental.
00:40:25.930 - 00:41:01.260, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'll add a little bit of color as well. So, like, the consensus and execution mechanism are decoupled, so they're happening asynchronously, which allows basically the execution to occupy the entire block time, as well as the validation and. Yeah, rotating leader set. So, yeah, I think the instant finality on that front, along with the performance side. Exactly. We were talking about, you can create dapps.
00:41:01.260 - 00:41:19.470, Speaker B: Just having a central limit order book and having that be the main way that people are trading, trading into super tight spreads that are being quoted by high frequency trading firms should mitigate a lot of the MEV off the bat, I would imagine. It looks pretty similar to Solana in that boat.
00:41:20.290 - 00:41:20.762, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:20.826 - 00:41:51.532, Speaker B: It also depends what takes off the most within the ecosystem. I think early on, I'm thinking of August 2021, Solana had this idea in their head for so long that Solana is going to be the Nasdaq of blockchains. That's the core use case. And then DJ natements and all the nfts that kind of, like, took over the chain, at least in terms of, like, an attention share. They kind of had to adapt to that. Right. In different forms.
00:41:51.532 - 00:42:11.680, Speaker B: If MEV was a thing at that point, it probably would have been like being the first to mint out all these nfts and then go and sell them. Right. So I think you need to wait. Like, we'll see how the ecosystem matures, but I would guess that it'll look more similar to Solana's. From an MEV standpoint.
00:42:17.420 - 00:42:45.234, Speaker A: I'm super curious. Yeah, there's a bunch of different technical architectures, and I'm excited that someone is really building a paralyzed EVM from the ground up, because to me, that was my biggest problem with Ethereum virtual machine is that you couldn't do parallelization and you couldn't tap into, kind of compute how it's been designed for. And the fact that Keone was also at jump I think speaks volumes, but.
00:42:45.322 - 00:43:05.018, Speaker D: Yeah, but there's a lot of other cool stuff that I think they're working on, too, like, different storage architectures and things like that that are other, like, major bottlenecks in the EVM. So definitely looking forward to your guys testing it and should be cool to see that off the ground and see what it can do.
00:43:05.194 - 00:43:27.230, Speaker A: I'm curious, though, Lucas, if someone was kind of watching, like, just one segment of the podcast or of this, what is. What is one takeaway that you would either want them to learn about either Jitto, the client that you're building me, the. Or I'd say crypto more broadly?
00:43:29.370 - 00:44:13.100, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think if. If I had to choose one, I think I would say that, like, Solana is the best place to build Defi products right now. I think it's like the fastest, the fastest, cheapest, highest throughput l one out there right now, and great place to build. There's a lot of, like, good tooling coming out, and you don't have to worry about high fees for your users or anything like that. It's just this ultimate liquidity. Shared the kyle was on podcast the other day. It's just this giant piece of shared state that anyone can access.
00:44:13.100 - 00:44:21.280, Speaker D: I think Solana's defi is coming back super strong and looking forward to seeing more builders on it.
00:44:21.400 - 00:44:23.540, Speaker A: The narrative is changing rather quickly.
00:44:24.260 - 00:44:30.000, Speaker D: Yeah, it's cool to see from the inside how fast it's changing.
00:44:30.500 - 00:45:02.580, Speaker C: I think we're going to look back on this podcast, like a year or two from now, and Lucas is going to say, Defi and Solana is coming back, and you're going to be like, no kidding. But no, it's been a great podcast. I think some great insights, and it was great hearing you answer some of these questions. Last thing we wanted to do was just give folks an opportunity. If they want to get involved with Jitto, if they're a developer, if they are looking to run a searcher and generate MeV, or if they just have a bunch of Solana and they're kind of deciding where to stake, how can they get involved?
00:45:03.040 - 00:45:39.520, Speaker D: Yeah, so Jito Labs website. Jito, WTF? There's information for searchers, stakers, and validators. So if you're a validator, you want to run the MEV client, help the network scale, earn some money, check that out. If you're a searcher, if you're doing market making or arbitrage, or want access to state faster, check out the searcher section. And then if you are interested in contributing to salon Defi, you want to min liquid staking token, go participate in providing liquidity and all that, you can go to jito.net work.
00:45:40.660 - 00:45:57.886, Speaker C: Amazing. Well, you heard it here, folks. First, folks, I think a year from now, Jito fire dancer client is going to be the gold standard. That's a prediction. I think that's going to be absolutely everywhere. And, yeah, it's been a great conversation. Thanks for coming through.
00:45:57.886 - 00:46:03.170, Speaker C: And, yeah, keep cracking on, guys. Only better days ahead.
00:46:03.830 - 00:46:05.694, Speaker D: True that. Thanks for having me.
00:46:05.822 - 00:46:06.398, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
00:46:06.454 - 00:46:07.270, Speaker B: Much appreciate it. Lucas.
