00:00:00.320 - 00:00:13.806, Speaker A: Every ecosystem kind of has to go through its initial hiccups. I always say you kind of have to walk through the fire. There's no shortcut. It's just kind of step by step. But I think to that point, Sui has had an amazing rollout.
00:00:13.878 - 00:00:22.190, Speaker B: What matters is if you have to say something different in terms of technology and how you think things might evolve in the future by using this technology.
00:00:22.350 - 00:00:32.618, Speaker A: Web three, more broadly, is still so small, and we really haven't reached scale. I think in my mind, every blockchain is really on the scale. Starting line.
00:00:32.714 - 00:00:47.550, Speaker B: Sui has to offer some very easy to use solutions. For example, the object oriented approach that we have that, you know, that you can actually create objects, and these objects can be owned from different addresses, they can be shared or they can be unique.
00:00:49.490 - 00:01:20.658, Speaker A: Greg, thank you so much for joining me. I really appreciate your time today. Big fan of SwE and all the things that Sui foundation is ultimately. One, recently launched with Mainnet, so congrats. But two, kind of the larger vision that Sui has set out to build. It's very ambitious, and I think having someone like yourself on the podcast to chat about it, how mainnet's going, is going to be an amazing conversation. So really excited to make this happen.
00:01:20.658 - 00:01:21.442, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:21.586 - 00:01:25.312, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for your invitation. Happy to be here.
00:01:25.426 - 00:01:53.570, Speaker A: Perfect. Well, maybe just a little brief briefly before we kind of jump into SWE and how things have ultimately progressed since Mainnet. You were recently on the board for the SWE foundation, but you have transitioned to managing director. Could you kind of talk a little bit about where you were previously and kind of what your role was at the SWE foundation to now what your main goal is within Sui as the managing director?
00:01:54.310 - 00:02:31.030, Speaker B: Sure. Just a couple of words on my background. I have like a, you know, as you call it, a bipolar background background in a sense that I spend a lot of time in my life in the academia and also in the business side. So by setting up, you know, either, you know, algorithm trading funds or payments, you know, companies. So I have, let's say, the vision of, or the view or the experience from two worlds. My experience with the Sui foundation started like, a year ago. And as you said, I'm a very big fan of sui myself.
00:02:31.030 - 00:03:52.090, Speaker B: And mainly I got to actually contribute or let's say, participate in the foundation because of the team that put together this fantastical one, as, as I said. And so for a year or almost ten months, I spent my time observing how this was built by the main contributors or the initial contributors of the technology which is the Mister Labs folks. And then when we were approaching Mainnet, we decided that it's time to actually contribute to the foundation, the resources and the human capital that needs in order to be really solid and independent as well as competent community member in order to push the frontier on the three blockchain. Mainnet was a fantastic experience, I have to say, one in a lifetime. Being in front of the computer and seeing the rollout of all the different levels and at some point see real transactions going through. It went fantastically well for most of the part of it. We didn't have anything that was unanticipated.
00:03:52.090 - 00:04:14.802, Speaker B: And we're just a bit more than a month now in Mainnet, and we see that activity is growing rapidly and steadily, regardless of the few hiccups that we had in the last few weeks that we think is part of the ecosystem. And since we look for the long term, we think that we are in good shape.
00:04:14.906 - 00:04:59.200, Speaker A: Definitely. Yeah, I think every ecosystem kind of has to go through its initial hiccups. I always say you kind of have to walk through the fire. There's no shortcut. It's just kind of step by step. But I think to that point, sue has had an amazing rollout and excited that it's live. I think history has kind of showed within crypto markets that bear markets are not necessarily as exciting to be launching versus a bull market, but the bear markets are where exciting things get built, and ultimately where people can actually kind of differentiate the noise from the actual kind of amazing tech that's being built.
00:04:59.200 - 00:05:07.336, Speaker A: And so it may not always feel like a great time to be launching, but I think history hopefully will be very kind to SwE's launch date.
00:05:07.488 - 00:05:29.212, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. You said it all. If you distinguish or differentiate technology from the market, then it's very. It doesn't matter, you know, the sentiment of the market per se. It's just what it matters is if you have to say something different in terms of technology and how you think things might evolve in the future by.
00:05:29.236 - 00:05:44.600, Speaker A: Using this technology 100% and maybe jumping back a little bit. Craig, you were ultimately on the board, but then you switched to managing director. Could you talk a little bit about the new role and what particularly within the role that you're trying to accomplish at the foundation?
00:05:45.640 - 00:07:10.164, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, when you role, I have to say that it's quite exciting because you have to do all the things that make your path and your strategy evolving through the use of different talent in different parts of the world, which is amazing. So we have people spread all over the world. We have a strategy to contribute to the community which includes, of course, having, you know, organizing builder houses in some, you know, 12 hours away country on the other side of the world. And then at the same time, we have to make sure that we fund and we're trying to push, you know, projects that they want to build on the, on the, on the street blockchain. And at the same time, you know, keep all the, the good spirits within the community, which is trying to, as we said before, prove us as a new padding of technology and a new way to actually think about web3 applications. So it's challenging because you have to coordinate, as I said, with people that they are in different places in the world and with different demands.
00:07:10.164 - 00:07:12.440, Speaker B: But at the same time, it's very exciting.
00:07:12.560 - 00:07:59.748, Speaker A: Wonderful. Yeah, no, it's, it is a fascinating problem. I think the distributed nature makes it a little bit extra challenging. But speaking to that point, I think particularly within the SWE foundation, majority of the team ultimately kind of spun out from Libra or even meta or Facebook at the time. And they ultimately built quite a few large scale, I would say, global compute and application infrastructure worldwide. They've had a lot of learning lessons from kind of scaling these very robust technical challenges. I think some of the challenges that they learned were on the technical side, but some of them were just in human coordination.
00:07:59.748 - 00:08:20.670, Speaker A: Can you talk about maybe a little bit of the experience, one to the technical side of the team and just kind of some of the learnings on a high level, and then secondly, talk to maybe some of the learnings that the engineers and the team have really brought forth from building such large distributed systems at scale.
00:08:21.330 - 00:09:24.024, Speaker B: Sure. I mean, to the best of my knowledge and, you know, as far as I can tell from the, from the teams that we are communicating, the most challenging thing, as you said, is actually to communicate in a sense that we write, we write something or we say something and we mean the same sometimes. You know, it's, people talk about each other and they understand different things because they have a different experience or different knowledge content. And so that was quite challenging in the sense that, you know, if you don't have like a very structured way of communication, that everything is well documented, first and second, like a process that, you know, can, can convert this, this communication into a fastendez final project or a final object or a final piece of code, then that can become very challenging. And that's one part. The other part is that when you break ground, actually there are no golden bullets. They're all silver bullets.
00:09:24.024 - 00:10:01.514, Speaker B: Right. So you don't have like a golden bullet and you say, okay, we will build this and this is what we are going to do and this is going to resolve the problem. When you break ground, many times you have to try something, you have to come back. You have to again push forward and then you have to come back again. So one process that is a great learning for us, and it's something that we very much appreciate, is that the ability to understand or to know what you don't know and then come back and correct and push forward. Another solution that might be the final one or the one that will prevail until the new change.
00:10:01.642 - 00:10:46.186, Speaker A: Yeah. Unknowing or not being afraid, I would say to venture out into the unknown and try things is a superpower and it's easier, actually. I would say it's much harder to do than to actually do. It is often scary to take that first step and to try something often within crypto, especially knowing that you're going to be criticized if we're trying something new. Can you maybe speak a little bit more to that? I think within crypto, it's kind of funny. You're building out in the open, there's a lot of commentators. Some of them are engineers, some of them are not, come from a variety of different backgrounds.
00:10:46.186 - 00:11:01.320, Speaker A: How have you, and maybe the internal team building some of the software today kind of dealt with some of the criticisms or even positive feedback just from outside of the court contributors?
00:11:02.140 - 00:11:39.548, Speaker B: Well, that's a very good question. The way that we see the reactions from the community, as you said, are very dispersed. So there are people that, you know, they understand what we're trying to solve or the complexity of the problem. And when they understand the complexity of the problem, they're a bit more, you know, receptive to this new solution. So they will try it out and then they will come back and say, you know what? This is working or it's not working or it's working to that extent. And of course, you have some other people that they are in general skeptical of the entire industry and how this is, how it's evolving. And there you get less constructive comments, to be honest with you.
00:11:39.548 - 00:12:17.226, Speaker B: But, you know, it's not that they do it on some, you know, they have some. It's expectation that they have some people, they have the expectation that, you know, blockchain will resolve everything in just one shot, which is not true. It's a long path. It's a marathon, as we say. And you have to take different steps forward and of course, have open ears and open mind to all the proposals that come in. So the community, as I said, it's quite varied. Like we are as human beings, right? There is a huge distribution of skills and experience, and each one has its own perception.
00:12:17.226 - 00:12:44.162, Speaker B: But in general, what we see is that we receive more and more attention from projects and human people and the community. But they really have faced difficulties with existing technology and they want to resolve these problems and offer solutions to the end user.
00:12:44.266 - 00:13:48.950, Speaker A: Yeah, and I would highlight, I mean, I say this on quite a few of my podcasts, but web3 more broadly is still so small, and we really haven't reached scale. I think in my mind, every blockchain is really on the starting line, in my opinion, and just from, in terms of user adoption. And what I would really love to see is these blockchains hit some amount of scale, whether that's being able to support the load, but also having applications be built on top of it that can derive real world value to the end users. And I think that part has just taken a little bit longer than we are kind of expecting it. But one question I personally kind of get asked quite a bit is where kind of maybe framing it slightly different to you. Where do you think ultimately swe the blockchain kind of fits in the current landscape because there are quite a few blockchain architectures. Not everybody believes all blockchains are on the starting line.
00:13:48.950 - 00:14:16.870, Speaker A: Some believe it's going to be an ethereum world dominated kind of by L2s. There's another camp where Solana is kind of already a high throughput blockchain. Why do we need another high throughput blockchain? Aptos has recently come online as well. In your point of view, where do you think swe ultimately fits in this landscape of blockchains? And do you feel like it's too late, as some may say, to start a blockchain?
00:14:17.330 - 00:15:22.700, Speaker B: Well, it's never late to innovate. So we see that as our main model. And to answer your question, the way we think is the following, that all these ones, they have a certain angle that they go about for the web3, and they solve certain problems. What we think we are having as a core leading is that we very much believe into the digitization ownership. We're talking about a new way of what we call tokenization. And there we think that that Sui has to offer some very, very easy to use solutions. For example, the object oriented approach that we have that, you know, you can actually create objects, and these objects can be owned from different addresses, they can be shared or they can be unique.
00:15:22.700 - 00:16:17.410, Speaker B: And to just give you an example, I mean, an object can be, for example, a transaction to transfer money, but at the same time can be, you know, a painting, a painting that we co own. And that's what our view is that asset ownership on the web will change in the next few years, will increase tremendously, and new players will come in, which is not only big fans of web3 and metaverse, but they can be also governments or entrepreneurs, startups, mature companies that they have huge problems even exchanging a file, and they are looking for solutions. So we see that Sui can be the backbone technology, that a lot of solutions can be given to the transition from the web two to the web3 world.
00:16:17.530 - 00:17:08.410, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think it's fairly early. I mean, it's been interesting to see what we have kind of experimented thus far, and really what has kind of caught on. I think the basic kind of decentralized financial infrastructure with amms have obviously caught on in the ethereum world or EVM world. Then we had nfts, particularly around the PFP moment, and that really caught on with, I would say, culture, which I was a little bit more surprised by. But really, I'd say now that it is a bear market, a little bit of the FOMo has kind of taken a step back. People are looking at it through a little bit more of a rational lens. People are having a hard time pointing to say, like a killer app that everybody is using.
00:17:08.410 - 00:17:25.070, Speaker A: Do you think, in your point of view, has it really been lack of infrastructure that has kind of not allowed the killer app, or do you ultimately think we were just so early, people are still trying to figure out the best way to use the blockchain technology?
00:17:25.570 - 00:18:28.974, Speaker B: That's a great question again. And I think that it's more of a lab, which is that I think people, or, you know, let's face it, again, there are lots of entrepreneurs, when they start, you know, thinking a new idea, maybe the first thing that comes to their mind is not to use the blockchain technology. And that's true. They are trying to see if they can do something or build an idea based on the traditional aids. One thing is this, one that, you know, people are probably not aware of the virtue of the technology, and this is something that the foundation is investing a lot, which is, you know, increase awareness through education and not education in the sense that people are uneducated, they're not educated enough for that specific type of technology and what it can bring to the new. All new ideas that are being out there. The second thing is, and this is something that we all in space would like to see, which is, you know, a clear regulation, you know, pattern.
00:18:28.974 - 00:19:39.566, Speaker B: And that's something that also makes some people less skeptical. And there, everybody in the space, regardless if it's, you know, Sui or Solana or, you know, or Atos, everybody wants, like, a clear landscape. X or y, it makes no difference as long as you know, what to expect. And that's the second, you know, impediment, I think, from the fact that you see some lack of, you know, or some hesitation to go into this technology. And the third one is that, you know, in, in my school, we never, you know, learned any language. Imagine now to have to learn all these different languages in order to start, you know, start, you know, programming a smart contract, let alone understand what this smart contract is. So once you understand what is a smart contract, the next thing is that we have also to go layer lower and start, you know, learning also, or giving the tools to the new generation to understand what movies, which is a great advantage of sui.
00:19:39.566 - 00:20:10.138, Speaker B: The language itself is a fantastic layer that you can build all sorts of applications. And then once you have this tool in place, people will start using it in their projects as they do with other languages. So I think these are the three things that, you know, are still in the making, and they have, we do have to invest a lot and also give them time to evolve.
00:20:10.274 - 00:21:00.878, Speaker A: Yeah. Education remains a key component. I think if I talk to anybody outside of the direct crypto world, I'll ask them about nfts or different projects, and they still have absolutely no idea or just think it's kind of like a glorified gambling, which from the outside, definitely, I can see that perspective. And I think it takes a little bit more approach, kind of with a magnifying glass to zoom in. But not everybody is that patient or wants to kind of learn the inner workings of these block technologies and how they work. And so we're closer. We're inching towards more mainstream adoptions day by day, but definitely understand some of the hesitancy from the outside.
00:21:00.878 - 00:21:40.102, Speaker A: But one thing that you mentioned there was move. And with Swe, you ultimately have the move programming language, which is very unique, but also the move virtual machine. And I think both of those will ultimately be a major benefit for the suite ecosystem. But being new, they come with their own set of bootstrapping challenges. And Solana kind of went through the same thing with having a different virtual machine outside of the Ethereum. Virtual machine. And in the early days of Solana, when I would talk to other investors or even builders in the space, they would say, oh, it's all copy projects of Ethereum.
00:21:40.102 - 00:22:16.908, Speaker A: There is nothing really new that's being built in the Solana ecosystem. And I'm actually hearing very similar sentiments about Swe. And they're like, oh, it's all copy projects of Solano or Ethereum. There's nothing uniquely different about Swe. And I always kind of laugh at that because it's just the early days. The basic primitives of borrow lending are kind of being built out as well as NFts and the different marketplaces. And then over time, engineers ultimately figure out how to uniquely leverage what SWE enables and can take advantage of the network.
00:22:16.908 - 00:22:29.200, Speaker A: Can you talk about kind of that slow rollout of what you've seen from SWE, what projects you're currently excited about and what you ultimately want to see get built on top of the network?
00:22:30.140 - 00:23:10.576, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. First of all, I'd like to, you know, emphasize something on usage as well, which is about the language and investment. So somebody, you know, if wants to start writing in Sui, has to make an investment, which means that it has to learn more. So that's true. And what we are trying to, as part of the community, as foundation, being part of the community, what we are trying to convince people is that this investment worth it, worth investment in time, effort, and, of course, resources. And there is where we are trying to convince more and more members of the community that it does have. It does make sense to invest, to learn the language.
00:23:10.576 - 00:24:10.090, Speaker B: So this is the basis, if you don't have, like, the basis, you cannot start, you know, or expect to build on top of that. Then on the projects that we receive, it is true that, you know, when you have a new layer, one, the first projects that you receive are the ones that they can move easily from other chains. This is true. So you get, like, a lot of inbound that is, that are projects that can move fast between two layers. And this is good because we can think of the adaptation model where if something, you know, is perceived as a better technology, then I want to be there as well and be the first one, perhaps. However, what we are really interested is to get projects that they will really make a difference, and they also have, like a vision or a view to the outside world. So it's nice to build new applications for the web3 community.
00:24:10.090 - 00:24:53.600, Speaker B: But as you said, this community is still small. And what we envision is actually open up this to more people that are out there. So the vision of the foundation is actually to enhance, to fund, to support projects that they are trying to look outside the web3 world. And that, of course, will means that they have to bridge a gap or a hybrid between web two and web3. But this is, we think, the way that things will happen. We don't think that, you know, one day everything from web two will be scrapped and then we'll have web3. So the projects that we are highly interested is, are the ones that they have.
00:24:53.600 - 00:25:49.886, Speaker B: Maybe they are building traditional arrays like web two, but they have their own difficulties. And what we're trying to tell them is that, you know, try out our technology and transfer, not even if you don't transfer the entire, you know, line of production or line of project or line of thought, try to transfer some of them on the sweet blockchain and web3. And the project that we see, they are coming from all over the place. So they're coming from gaming, which is something that Swiss build quite suit, I would say, because of its fantastic interoperability and object orientation. So you can have like a weapon in Fortnite and you want to exchange it with a weapon in Call of Duty. How you do that? I mean, Sui can do that with its obvious object oriented approach. You know, that there's a weapon that you hold in one thing, in one game, and you know that you want to exchange it to something else.
00:25:49.886 - 00:26:56.310, Speaker B: So we increase, you know, knowledge, of course, of what is stored on the chain and of course, interoperability. The other thing is that we see a lot of projects that are coming from exactly this for exactly this purpose, which is interoperability. So projects that are trying to actually be, if I may use that word, agnostic on chain, but relevant to all chains. So that's also something that is very much of interest. Why? Because as we know, as we want projects and people to use our chain, we also want them to have the ability to use the entire industry and decide which is the best and having a great trust in our technology. We think that the inter availability in the long run will help the project that is much more based on fundamentals and solves problems. We also see some projects in Defi sphere, but there, as we said, since it, it's a very regulated environment.
00:26:56.310 - 00:28:00.438, Speaker B: The projects that we see there are in a more, let's say, primitive stage, but they are still trying to move ahead. And last but not least, there is a huge space out there that we think more and more projects will come towards us, which is e commerce. Why because if you think about it, where is the best place to have metaverse experiences? It's actually in e commerce and marketplaces. You want to have your own avatar, walk inside like a metaverse or store, shop around, exchange clothes or shoes or something else. And then with a click of a button, you have your basket full, you just check out, you pay with your crypto, and you go home. Of course, that still is not a fully NFT world. It actually has a connection with real world, which is, I do expect my shoes to come in my door.
00:28:00.438 - 00:28:14.014, Speaker B: But it's a space that we see that is going to have a lot of action in the next few years. And we very much welcome projects there that they move towards this direction.
00:28:14.102 - 00:28:39.646, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah. I definitely agree with kind of the commentary that it's going to be a slow transition from like web two to web3. It's not going to be an overnight thing. And attracting some of those really high, high talent, very sophisticated engineers from the web two world has been somewhat of a challenge. Ultimately, crypto is very cyclic. Or we have the bull markets, we have the bear markets.
00:28:39.646 - 00:29:06.300, Speaker A: People get excited in bull markets and often, or more often than not, kind of lose interest in the bear markets. If someone in the web two world was interested in building in the SWE network, and they didn't know too much about the blockchain world, what would your kind of elevator pitch be to engineers to build on SwE versus the other options that they have out there?
00:29:06.600 - 00:29:32.626, Speaker B: That's a good question. I think I would tell them, you know, the first to learn the language, as I said, which is move and understand the virtues that this language has in terms of easiness to program. So that would be the first thing I think, which is already an advantage. Why? Because you have like one. Okay, it's one more language in your cv, but it's not like that. It's one more skill that you have. And, you know, the more skills you have as a person, the better it is.
00:29:32.626 - 00:30:52.374, Speaker B: You are welfare wise, you are better off. Right. Because you can cope with more problems. The second thing I would tell them is that if you want to build on, on a new l one, you have to think first what type of questions or what type of real problems you can actually append next. Because if you think about it, if I can build on a layer one, and I'm comfortable with it, but in the first question I get from my, let's say, partner, or from my firm or from my friend that we want to set up a company, I cannot solve this problem, then that is something that won't work. So we strongly believe that Sui has or gives the developers the power to actually answer to real world problems, because at the end of the day, I might, and I don't know what type of technology is running on my iPhone, but my iPhone is my life, right? Everything is on my iPhone. So if somebody is asking me, I will tell him, you know, what can you solve, you know, a real world problem with Sui? Okay.
00:30:52.374 - 00:30:54.014, Speaker B: Invest on it. Do it.
00:30:54.142 - 00:31:32.074, Speaker A: Amazing. Okay. One thing that I would love to kind of touch upon that move is obviously a critical part, the programming language, making sure that youre building safe, smart contracts. I think the engineers that are already in this space are amazing. But time and time again, we've seen smart contract bugs, and I now have kind of come to the conclusion it's not really the engineer's fault. It's kind of, we need to go a level deeper. And I think move is ultimately provide some of those safeguards that allow engineers to focus strictly on that application and not kind of some of the small nuances that could introduce bugs for smart contract safety.
00:31:32.074 - 00:32:06.440, Speaker A: But outside of particularly move, SWe does a couple other things that I think are fairly unique that I want to highlight and would love to have you expand upon is the SWE's fastpath consensus, kind of having a dual consensus algorithm, and then also the intra validator sharding versus inter validator sharding. Can you talk maybe on this on a high level to people that are not as familiar with SWE's core technology and what each of these primitives ultimately unlock? Sure.
00:32:06.820 - 00:32:50.496, Speaker B: One thing that is usually a problem in blockchain is finality, how fast I can have finality. And so these two technology, they help a lot on that. So I can have very fast what the final action is going to be. And so I know that if I want to transfer money, this has happened, and I got back the validation for that. And that's important because many applications in real world, they require that we know this information quite early. Of course, there are other functions. For example, I might want to transfer my house, and I have to exchange a contract that does not need to be the finality of seconds, which is what so you can do.
00:32:50.496 - 00:33:42.026, Speaker B: And there, the object related approach that allows some of the transactions to be executed in parallel helps a lot. And that's exactly what, again, the setup of validators is helping with because, okay, I might want to transfer you funds right now, and we have to update our wallets instantaneously. But if we exchange a contract. And this contract is, you know, my house. That can happen, you know, after ten minutes or after 1 hour. It doesn't have to be to be done right now. And so the structure of the nodes and the tokenomics are, and the object oriented approach helps first to have finality when you need it, and second, it parallelizes activities so you can actually have an enormous throughput.
00:33:42.026 - 00:34:36.983, Speaker B: So you can increase with parallelization, you can actually have, like you can increase of course, composability as well, so you can compose different elements. But at the same time, parallelization of transactions helps you actually to scale up in a big time. Because if we want to be realistic, I mean, if you want to offer like an infrastructure and you want this infrastructure to work in the real world, then we're talking about billions of transactions, and you have to make sure that your infrastructure can support them, because then you won't be surprised if people start saying, oh well, and what if my project succeeds? Which is always a question that everybody has, right? When you start a project, you might have one transaction, but you care, or you are worried, what if I have 1 billion transactions? And that's exactly what the technology is doing. It's adding finality, fast finality where it's needed, and add scalability where again, I.
00:34:36.991 - 00:35:03.564, Speaker A: Always say parallelization today is kind of a nice thing to have, but once you actually reach scale in the future, it will go from a nice thing to have to a requirement. And I think we're just so early that majority of the virtual machines today can kind of exist being single threaded and having transaction execution being serially. But in the future I don't think that will be the case.
00:35:03.732 - 00:35:13.164, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you that there you have to also be very careful with the actually, you know, technology that's being developed and how these things are.
00:35:13.212 - 00:35:13.800, Speaker A: Being.
00:35:16.140 - 00:36:07.882, Speaker B: Managed on the VM side and how machines are going to communicate with each other, of course. But at least you have to find a structure that helps you, being less dependent on the timing or the sequencing of machine to execute an order or a command or something that you know, is dependent on time. It always has limitations and you have to find a way, a smart way to expand that. So it's okay to have limitations, but it's also good to have solutions, how actually to multiply these limitations and then if you multiply them, maybe you overcome the problem.
00:36:08.066 - 00:37:21.950, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's fascinating to see how these things will ultimately unfold. And I think I swe again is going to be at the forefront, it will just take some time for people to ultimately realize kind of how the landscape is ultimately unfolding. One thing that is very important to the blockchain world as well, though, is the topic of decentralization and making sure that you're sufficiently enough decentralized. And I think bitcoin obviously being the first to kind of create self sovereignty within the blockchain landscape, and then ethereum expanding upon that with smart contracts, and now we kind of have a new class of blockchains that are high throughput and decentralized. Can you kind of talk about how SwE is viewing decentralization? I know today there's around 104 ish validators, multiple more, a couple hundred more nodes. Is the plan to kind of stay around a couple hundred validators or is it to expand to a couple thousand validators? How is the foundation kind of thinking about decentralization within the foundation?
00:37:22.530 - 00:38:03.154, Speaker B: Sure. Right now we have like 104 validators and more than 387, if I'm not mistaken, nodes. So this is expanding fast and paced. The way that we want to do that is of course to give to the community to decide which ones are the good players and how this is going to evolve in the future. The fact that in the beginning we have structured it in such a way that we want it to be functional, it's only for that reason. So once you have a functional network, then the network belongs to the community, and the community will owe it and will decide how this is going to evolve. And that's exactly what we want to do.
00:38:03.154 - 00:38:34.314, Speaker B: But we want to do it in such a way that we don't risk the reliability of the network and also we don't fall short of the expectations of the community members. So we are all part of this community. And, you know, we invest a lot to the community to understand what is best for all of us, and that's exactly how we want to move as well. And of course, the ultimate goal, as I said, is that everything should be decided by the community through the right actions and the good actors that are going to be playing there.
00:38:34.442 - 00:39:21.080, Speaker A: Makes sense. It's interesting, even within the community, outside of SwE, what is sufficient decentralization? If you ask bitcoiners, they'll say you need 10,000 plus nodes. Ethereum, I think, is in the realm of 5000. Solana's a couple thousand, and then, and some networks have ten. And so there's a wide spectrum of kind of what people are kind of viewing as decentralization. Do you think the community, it's too early to kind of arrive at where Swe is going to land in that? Or do you think starting around 100 and just kind of seeing where it goes is kind of the playbook?
00:39:22.180 - 00:39:58.116, Speaker B: We think that, as I said, education is a first and foremost. So once people understand where we want to go, which is like having, like, a network that is sustainable in the long run, then the right decisions will come with that. And the tokenomics that have been decided or have been designed in such a way that, you know, they actually, how can I say, they incentivize good actions and decentralization in a. In a. In a rhythm that the community will decide. What we don't want to, you know, say is that we will decide who is gonna be a valid or who is not. That's not the purpose of the foundation.
00:39:58.116 - 00:40:31.396, Speaker B: The personal purpose of foundation is to give the community the tools to decide itself how this wants to evolve. And you're right. I mean, different things have meant different to different people in different times with respect to decentralization. That's true. Yeah. And so I don't know if, you know, the right number is 10,000 or it's 20,000. But what I do know that, okay, we have some metrics that we measure the network and the voting power, like the Satoshi coefficient, and all these metrics that they have come after that.
00:40:31.396 - 00:40:59.070, Speaker B: However, the network being decentralized has to also serve the purpose of the network itself. So if the network is working better with 10,000 nodes, then that's something that the community will decide. Again, this is our goal. Our goal is to educate enough the community that knows how to govern the network at the best interest of the network itself.
00:40:59.190 - 00:41:46.460, Speaker A: Very logical answer. Let the community decide. I like it in terms of, I think now being a little bit of a slow period, there is not a lot of hype. I think everybody's kind of going back to the drawing boards in the different communities. And really, I mean, now that there's kind of a plethora of different layer ones, plethora of different L2s, I think there has been kind of a more fierce competition to figure out how to attract developers and engineering talent to build on the network. And I think one of the best parts that I've seen personally that has kind of worked well has been the hacker houses. Ethereum, I think, did a great job at this.
00:41:46.460 - 00:42:03.180, Speaker A: Solana has really, I would say, taken it a step further. And I know Swe and the foundation there is also doing hacker houses around the world. Could you talk a little bit about what is the plan for the hacker houses. What's kind of the vision that the Sui foundation has set out for?
00:42:03.890 - 00:43:02.790, Speaker B: Absolutely, and thank you for asking this question. We have planned quite a few builder houses and hackathons this year. We have already concluded four. The last one was in a Seoul and actually right now the team is preparing one in Choppa. And we have planned to have like one hackathon and builder house in every month of the calendar year. And why we do that? Because we see this as the layer one, as we said, as the layer one to approach and go down to locally and actually prove that we are there to support and encourage people to start building on our layer. So we take it very seriously and we invest a lot of resources, not only because, okay, money was one thing, but what is important to note here is that the foundation is, is investing a lot in human resources.
00:43:02.790 - 00:44:00.458, Speaker B: So we actually have people there who not just, you know, an events organizer that is organizing an event with dreams. That's nice as well, you know, nice to have. But at the same time we have people on the ground that are from the foundation and they're working really hard 24/7 with interested parties being individual developers that they want to develop, being projects that they want to expand their, their abilities and they understanding in the move, and sui foundation being partners and investors that they want to see how they can actually coordinate and invest in projects that they build in Sui. So it's like an ecosystem that we are trying to bootstrap from the ground upwards. And that's something that we are highly interested because it serves the fourth pillar, which is education. Once you have people on the ground, you can actually start talking to them and start giving them information. So people love information.
00:44:00.458 - 00:44:07.710, Speaker B: The more information you have, the better. You know, Socrates used to say that there is only one good, which is knowledge, and one bad which is ignorance.
00:44:08.210 - 00:45:00.416, Speaker A: That's funny. No, I think, I mean, from what I've personally seen, hacker houses really allow that education component head and shoulders above everything else and physically. Funny enough, being in person and being kind of co located, being able to ask those questions in real time has made a big difference in what I've seen from the engineering point of view and the quality of builders that are attracted to the network. It's a playbook that I think is very effective, but few do very well. So it's exciting to hear that the SWE foundation team is putting such a tremendous amount of effort into the hacker house because they, the amount of energy going into them will pay tenfold later on.
00:45:00.608 - 00:45:01.600, Speaker B: I don't agree with you.
00:45:01.640 - 00:45:58.330, Speaker A: I totally get, yeah. So I think it's been an interesting kind of period. Now, again, it's a little bit of a bear market. People are kind of trying to figure out these different ecosystems. If we could maybe do take a step back, would you compare SwE to any of these other ecosystems out there? I know a lot of engineers, heart and soul, are really wrapped around the Ethereum community and kind of how they have to position themselves in the market. Do you feel like particularly people are open minded to experimenting with, say, a swee of the world, that they're really giving up on anything? Or do you feel like maybe even backing up? Like, do you feel like there is a different value set, that building on one blockchain versus another?
00:45:59.070 - 00:47:09.474, Speaker B: I know that's a great question. And honestly, from the foundation's point of view, what we believe is we believe in the power of unity, which means that if another blockchain or somebody that, you know, is coding in some other l, one can find the solution in sui, why not use it? I mean, because we will all be better off. So we're not telling people what they should do. It's not our goal that it's a community that will decide again which layer one is gonna use. But what I would say and what I would suggest is that since our common goal is to expand and give solutions on the web3 space and try to improve everyday life of, you know, everybody out there, why not combine knowledge? So some things that, you know, sue is doing well, use them. And, you know, having, like, a, you know, how can I say, dogmatic approach that, you know, I'm, let's say, doing only this part or I'm dealing with this l one only. I think that is contrary to the idea of web3 and blockchain.
00:47:09.474 - 00:47:22.948, Speaker B: We have to be open minded. As you said, I'm very big believer of that. And we should push the frontier, all of us together, because, you know, the value that we will create is actually something that will benefit everybody.
00:47:23.044 - 00:48:14.340, Speaker A: I do agree it is very early, and I always say it's a little bit too early for night fights at this stage, and we should try to lift each other up. But it is very interesting just how the space has kind of unfolded. I think maybe the money aspect with some of these tokens, I think can be great for bootstrapping some of these networks. And then also it can make things a little bit more challenging when the times get a little bit difficult. But nonetheless, it's very interesting time, I would say, maybe kind of projecting forward either to the end of this year or into next year. What are the things that you would either like to see or uniquely excited about, whether in the foundation or applications being built on top of the sweetnet?
00:48:14.920 - 00:49:10.564, Speaker B: Well, I'm super excited because there are so many applications that they are coming and they are building on the foundation without trying to be specific or pinpoint one of them as a community. I would expect that Sear foundation will keep getting out funding and also pushing the frontier on so many nice projects that I would very much stay tuned and see what is coming next. Without trying to be secretive. I'm just trying to be open minded and at the same time optimistic that things go well. We should all fear nothing and push the frontier and aim for things that will change our lives.
00:49:10.692 - 00:49:22.788, Speaker A: Is there any more that you can share on the grant or foundation front of? If an engineer wants to get in contact with foundation, the best route to do that or the best way to apply for it?
00:49:22.924 - 00:50:10.750, Speaker B: Yeah, of course we are open. We have an open process that is actually on our website, so anybody can go there and apply life or the brand. The process is pretty fast and so, you know, you get around with in less than two weeks you get an answer and it's very competitive, of course, but at the same time it's very competent people that are in the back of that. So I very much like to encourage everybody that has an idea or wants to supplement his already his project that is already in some other layer. One to definitely explore the possibility of building, or building parallel as well in Sui and see the advantages of the blockchain.
00:50:11.370 - 00:50:42.300, Speaker A: Cool. Definitely recommend people to reach out and apply and see if you can get any grant funding. Maybe a little bit more personal on your standpoint. Greg, you obviously have kind of been in the technology world for some time, have kind of seen the blockchain landscape unfold. Why decide to partner with the Sui foundation? What uniquely captivated you about either the technology or the team that made you decide to want to be involved a little bit more personally.
00:50:44.360 - 00:50:54.652, Speaker B: I have to be very honest, it's the team and the technology itself. I'm a very big believer of the project and I truly believe that it can make the difference. We can change the world.
00:50:54.776 - 00:51:34.532, Speaker A: Team and technology. I love it. So is it again, just kind of their unique approach, them having spent multiple years at meta and Facebook, kind of understanding the core bottlenecks of what ultimately blockchains, the hardships that they'll encounter, and then also, I would say maybe even bringing it back to kind of the time that they spent at web two, some of the problems that they identified within the web two world, not owning your own data, not being able to participate in the network in some form or fashion within ownership, and being able to kind of marry those two together.
00:51:34.716 - 00:51:56.200, Speaker B: Absolutely, absolutely. And I would also add that, believe it or not, before, when I was trying to explain web3 and blockchain technology was a bit more difficult. Now with sweet blockchain and the way they have approached all these, you know, real world problems, it's a bit easier to explain to my grandmother. So I find it is very, very important.
00:51:57.020 - 00:52:00.160, Speaker A: Has your grandmother got her swe name yet?
00:52:00.540 - 00:52:08.800, Speaker B: Well, you know, it's, her name is like her surname, so it's very old fashioned. You know, everybody takes his name here.
00:52:09.300 - 00:52:12.840, Speaker A: So it may still be available on swe names.
00:52:13.340 - 00:52:18.680, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. You know, we both had a domain, so she can, you know, have like something to be proud of.
00:52:19.730 - 00:52:32.350, Speaker A: Amazing. Cool. Well, maybe kind of as we're wrapping up the podcast, was there anything particular that you wanted to cover that we didn't touch upon or anything else?
00:52:34.090 - 00:52:58.404, Speaker B: As I said, you know, it's a new endeavor and people should think and push the frontier there and take the time, effort and resources to do it because it's worth it. You know, there are so many unresolved problems that we face every day that, you know, having one more technology that might solve even a small part of them, it's a very great, you know, achievement for the humankind.
00:52:58.532 - 00:53:08.720, Speaker A: I agree. The self sovereignty that ownership is very important and if we can unlock it at scale, I think it will be a huge advance. Yeah, definitely.
00:53:09.380 - 00:53:16.932, Speaker B: Connection, inclusiveness, you know, logistics, you know, authenticity. All these things that, you know, they bother us every day.
00:53:17.116 - 00:53:34.172, Speaker A: Maybe wrapping it up with a couple spicy questions. Is there any like, network outside of the sweet ecosystem that you think does things that you uniquely well or that you either admire and any ecosystem that you just think will probably not be around in a couple years to come?
00:53:34.276 - 00:53:53.006, Speaker B: Well, to be honest with you, I wish that all are around and I think that, you know, they all do something, you know, special, uniquely good, and they contribute to the overall picture. So I see it like a forest. I don't, I don't see it as a tree. So if the forest, you know, grows, it's good for everybody.
00:53:53.118 - 00:54:01.926, Speaker A: Very safe political answer. Well, Greg, thank you so much for coming on. I really appreciate your time today and it was a really fun conversation. Thank you.
00:54:02.078 - 00:54:04.110, Speaker B: Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot again. Have a great time.
