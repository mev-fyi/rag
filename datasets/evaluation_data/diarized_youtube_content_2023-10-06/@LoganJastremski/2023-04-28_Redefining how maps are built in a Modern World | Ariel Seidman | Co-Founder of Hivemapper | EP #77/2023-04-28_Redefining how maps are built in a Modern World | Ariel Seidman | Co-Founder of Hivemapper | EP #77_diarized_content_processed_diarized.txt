00:00:00.160 - 00:00:22.342, Speaker A: I'm a mapping guy. Google probably chose one of the most expensive ways to go build their map. We were paying people in cash. People weren't passionate about it, right. In the same way, it was kind of like the renter mentality versus the owner mentality, right. And so holding the crypto layer such that it will incentivize people properly, it'll kind of align all the economic, financial incentives. We don't care what car you're driving.
00:00:22.342 - 00:00:54.550, Speaker A: Like, you can drive a truck, you can drive a Tesla, you can drive a shitty Mazda from, like, 1995. What we do care about is where you're driving. I mean, doing 11 million transactions on Ethereum would be basically bankrupt the company, right? Bankrupt the entire project. So it's like, why do that? That's stupid. 30,000 users that comes in and, like, starts contributing on Hivemapper. I would be willing to bet a lot of money that they will never ask me, or for that matter, anybody else, what blockchain is this running on.
00:00:56.970 - 00:01:04.870, Speaker B: Today? I'm joined by Ariel. Super excited to have you on the podcast. The founder of Hivemapper. Thank You so much for joining me.
00:01:04.990 - 00:01:06.690, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.
00:01:07.110 - 00:01:38.274, Speaker B: I think, in general, the decentralized physical infrastructure networks are really coming alive, and their story is just now starting to be told. And I think particularly what you're building with Hivemapper has also started to gain a lot of traction, a lot of data, and so, really just excited to have the conversation and appreciative of you coming on the podcast. I think this is going to kind of open up a whole new world of crypto applications, and I think you're really one of the pioneers in the space.
00:01:38.442 - 00:01:44.270, Speaker A: I appreciate that. Yeah. Well, after this podcast, you'll know more about mapping than you probably ever would want to know.
00:01:44.730 - 00:02:10.660, Speaker B: Let's do it. I used to be at Tesla. I was on the supercharger side of things, but all those Tesla cars collected a good amount of map data, and I was nerding out on how they did some of that training. And so I'm sure you can do lots of fancy stuff with Hivemapper as well. But maybe before we dive into hype, mappers specifically, could you just give a little bit of context on who you are and how you got involved in the blockchain and crypto industry?
00:02:11.320 - 00:02:53.770, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I'm not, I guess, what you would call a crypto native. I mean, I definitely bought Ethereum, like, fairly early on, and then just continued to kind of keep track of it. Ethereum was really the first thing that was interesting to me because you can actually build new applications on top of it, whereas bitcoin never kind of like morphed into that for whatever reason. So Ethereum definitely was super interesting when it came out and I just was tracking it. But I'm a mapping guy, so my first job out of school was at Yahoo. And it was like a fun time to be at Yahoo, this like 2006, 2005 timeframe. And it was fun because we were still very competitive with Google, both in search as well as in maps.
00:02:53.770 - 00:03:48.628, Speaker A: So I sat within the search group and most people don't realize that. So we had like 35% market share. I think Google had like 38, 40, but they were definitely like gaining on us and it was a big business for us, search. And so we were, we looked at all of our queries and like roughly 30% of all of our queries had some sort of local or geo dimension or mapping dimension to them, right? So people are searching for restaurants, you know, people searching for directions, people searching for like, what's the population of Xdem? So I started to look after all of our local data and then I took over all the map stuff as well and grew that to 80% market share. But what then happened was Google start to collect their own data. Everybody in the industry was just licensing data from a whole set of providers. So Google started to collect their own data.
00:03:48.628 - 00:04:09.278, Speaker A: As they collect their own data, clearly their map got a lot better. They sort of take market share from us. So we went to, at the time, the CEO of Yahoo and were like, look, we got a pony up here, right? Like, this is serious business. We need to go collect our own data. Like, we need $220 million. We came back with like ten or 15. And it was like, I mean, it was kind of silly.
00:04:09.278 - 00:04:10.550, Speaker A: It was like, what are you going to do with 1050 million?
00:04:10.590 - 00:04:12.598, Speaker B: Like classic startup problem.
00:04:12.774 - 00:04:49.898, Speaker A: Yeah, like map half of California, then call it a day. I mean, the whole thing, they just weren't really like understanding the scale and the data operation that would need to happen in order to really compete with Google. So I got frustrated and left Yahoo. But what I did observe was that Google's approach was incredibly expensive. There's a lot of different ways you can build a map. Google probably chose one of the most expensive ways to go build their map. What that meant was, a couple of things that meant was they were not able to update their map as frequently as they ought to.
00:04:49.898 - 00:05:35.930, Speaker A: And then the second thing it meant was that there's many parts of the world where it just wasn't, you know, it didn't pencil out. Right. Like, mapping in South America aggressively or Africa or even parts of Asia, relative to, like, how they could monetize, just given how their cost structure is, was really hard, right. And so, like, if you're a product manager sitting in Mountain View, California, you're like, look, I can spend more money, like, mapping in London or Los Angeles, and I can see a good RoI versus, you know, Manila or Kuala Lumpur or Lagos, Nigeria, or even Sao Paulo. It's a lot harder to, like, rationalize that from a cost perspective. So that's their achilles heel, right? Is that just, the cost is just so incredibly high. But look fast forward to today.
00:05:35.930 - 00:06:10.620, Speaker A: Like, you know, even though it's very expensive, they definitely, they're the 800 pound gorilla in the market, and nobody, like, there's. It's not like there's a startup that comes along. You know, I don't know if you're doing, like, marketing analytics or sales automation. There's like a, you know, a new startup that's created every five minutes in maps. It's not like you have a new startup that is trying to build a map. Waze obviously did it. There's others as well that have, but it's few and far between that are really going for global scale, and so.
00:06:10.620 - 00:06:58.520, Speaker A: And the reason for that is just hard, right? It's, like, really, really, really hard, and you need capital. But all the pieces of where we're at today with Hivemapper took years to fall into place, and we went down a lot of blind alley. So I left and then started another company before Hivemapper called Gigwalk, and it was in the data collection games that we had, like, 2 million users all over the world collecting data on behalf of, actually Google Maps was a customer, Bing maps as a customer, Bloomberg Financial, and they would collect data. The problem with that business, Washington, we did not own the data. So the economics of that were not great. I left and then started Hivemapper late 2015, 2016. We started with drones.
00:06:58.520 - 00:07:26.860, Speaker A: The idea was always the same, build a global map of the world. But we started with drones. Drones did not work because the battery technology sucked, and it wasn't getting better. The second thing was you had all this local government regulation that was getting in the way, and so it just made it really tough to, like, you know, like, I don't know, the city of Palo Alto has, like, different than, like, you know, the city right next door to it. Right. So it was just kind of, like, crazy. So we put that to the side, but we had built this, like, mapping engine behind the scenes.
00:07:26.860 - 00:08:00.118, Speaker A: We put that to the side, and then we went, you know, for basically street level through these dash cams. It was not our own dash cam. It was a third party dash cam. There were a lot of issues with it. And so we decided, hey, we got to go build our own dash cam to, like, really get the entire pipeline working at the level that we would want, both from a quality perspective in terms of the map and also from the perspective of just making it really passive and easy for contributors. So we did that. And, well, let me back up there.
00:08:00.118 - 00:08:38.842, Speaker A: We were like, okay, we started that project, but we didn't have enough capital to go and fully execute it. And then I saw helium 2019. I think I was like, ooh, that's interesting, because we were paying people in cash, and it wasn't like people weren't really interested. People weren't passionate about it in the same way. It was the render mentality versus the owner mentality. We basically decided two things. One is we're going to go build a dash cam, and b, we're going to go and build in the crypto layer such that it will incentivize people properly.
00:08:38.842 - 00:08:49.390, Speaker A: It'll kind of align all the economic, financial incentives. So then we raised $18 million from multicoin back in, like, November of 2021.
00:08:50.050 - 00:09:34.700, Speaker B: Amazing. Fascinating story. It is. I mean, map, as you said, it is a challenging problem, and even the self driving problem has the same, same hardships. It's hard to collect all that data how, I guess maybe getting into hivemappers specifically, could you talk about, I mean, because you have one, the physical, real world infrastructure of that actual dash cam, and there's people actually doing things in the physical world. But you also have kind of this crypto component and mapping engine on the backend. Could you speak specifically to kind of each of those single pieces and then how they all combine together?
00:09:35.000 - 00:10:18.400, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's a big, massive data engine, and it starts with collection of the data. So you buy this dash cam from hivemapper. It looks and smells like every other dash cam in the world, but it does have specific components inside of it that are critical for mapping. So we have to have really high quality GPS or gnss, because if you're not in the right place, then you're not going to build a very good map. It has to have what we refer to as location verification or location security. What that basically means is we need to trust that you're actually collecting in Venice, California, and not Sao Paulo or somewhere else.
00:10:18.400 - 00:10:27.936, Speaker A: And then obviously, from an imager perspective, it has to have a high quality imager on it so that we can actually see the stuff and then use that high.
00:10:28.108 - 00:10:31.100, Speaker B: Share some of the specs of the dash cam.
00:10:31.400 - 00:10:50.780, Speaker A: Sure. I mean, it's all public data. Like it has a u blocks. I think it's an m nine n component, which is. That's the GNSS module. It's a very high quality gnss. So for higher, it's much better than anything you're going to get on iPhone or Android, as an example.
00:10:50.780 - 00:11:37.180, Speaker A: And it also is encrypted. And so that basically means is all the GPS coordinates are going to be encrypted. And so it's harder for somebody to spoof their location as a result of that being encrypted. The imager, I forgot which I think we're using a Sony imager, but again, very high quality imager. The other thing is that it's integrated very, very tightly with the app. So you basically download the Hivemapper app and it's tightly integrated because what we want is we want to make that data transfer process free. We don't want you to have to go and buy a data plan for your dash cam.
00:11:37.180 - 00:12:04.400, Speaker A: It's like, no, basically, it moves all the data to your phone. When your phone then connects to Wifi, it'll automatically move it up. If you have an unlimited data plan on your phone, then great, you can use that and it automatically uploaded as you're driving. That is all data collection. That's really, really important. Underestimate a how hard that is to do on a global scale. We don't care what car you're driving.
00:12:04.400 - 00:13:06.302, Speaker A: You can drive a truck, you can drive a Tesla, you can drive a shitty Mazda from 1995. Ultimately, you can't do this right now, but ultimately, if you're driving a motorcycle, great. So we really don't care what vehicle you're driving. What we do care about is where you're driving. Right? So if you're building, like, I mean, Tesla's obviously really popular in places like Beverly Hills and Santa Monica and Miami, but not as much in, I don't know, Oklahoma as an example. And so that's really challenging, is like, how do you build a global map? You need that diversity of geographical presence. So all that data ultimately make all the imagery data, location data, how fast the car is traveling, all that kind of stuff makes its way up to Hivemapper, and then we start to extract objects out of the imagery.
00:13:06.302 - 00:13:25.986, Speaker A: So what does that mean? That means it's like, hey, that's a speed limit sign. That's 25 mph. That's a one way street. The name of the business over here is called Sal's Pizzeria, right? All of that kind of information gets extracted out, and then the community is kind of training the AI that is doing that automated extraction.
00:13:26.178 - 00:13:42.750, Speaker B: And on my ignorance, and maybe for people that have not been in the mapping industry as long as you, what is that valuable component in the map data? Is it just the data itself, or is it specifically kind of these imageries that you are pulling out of those images or both?
00:13:43.380 - 00:14:24.010, Speaker A: Well, the imagery serves as, like, the way to think about it is like, the imagery really serves as raw ingredients into the map, right? So our eyes, a camera is effectively like eyes everywhere. And if you had eyes everywhere, then you would, you know, that would be helpful, right, in terms of collecting that raw data. But somebody then needs to, like, take all that information out of that imagery to say, okay, this road over here has two lanes in each direction. There's a bike lane that goes northbound. There's a speed limit over here. That's 35. Right hand lane.
00:14:24.010 - 00:15:14.774, Speaker A: Over here is a turn right only lane. All of that kind of detailed information, that's ultimately what forms the map. So that you can do things like turn by turn navigation, so you can do things like, hey, I want to look up Sal's pizzeria shop and get directions there. I wanna look at, like, if I'm doing a truck delivery and I'm doing to the back of, like, target, right? I wanna see, like, okay, am I gonna actually be able to fit my truck around? Right? Are there any vertical, like, height clearances? Like, all of that detailed information, if you think about, you know, you're taking a trip or you're going to the grocery store, you're going out to a place that you've never been before. Like, you know, the map helps you in all these little tiny ways. That's quite useful, obviously. And so that's one layer of the map.
00:15:14.774 - 00:15:34.868, Speaker A: The second layer of the map is, or should say a layer above that is kind of what we refer to as traffic and incidents. So this would be more like waze, right? Like, okay, there was a three car crash here. Here's an image of it. By the way. Hey, by the way, the lanes over here just went from. Because there's some construction on the road. There's some debris on the road.
00:15:34.868 - 00:16:06.780, Speaker A: It went from three lanes down to one lane. And that debris, by the way, is going to take hours because some tree fell into the road or whatever it is that's going to take hours to go. In fact, it's not going to be a quick thing. All of that information is ultimately helping inform the map and get people to where they want to go and get people to where they want to go very quickly. There's a lot of other use cases for maps. I mean, like weather obviously uses maps. Business intelligence uses maps.
00:16:06.780 - 00:16:13.228, Speaker A: So there's thousands of different use cases for maps, but we're very focused on, like, navigation and logistics.
00:16:13.404 - 00:16:46.260, Speaker B: Gotcha. Very interesting. So on. I mean, there's maybe speak a little bit to why would someone buy these dash cams? What is their kind of incentive, in your words? Kind of that ownership that they weren't getting when you were previously. Kind of just giving them cash to map these networks. And then ultimately that data that you do collect on the mapping side and the imagery, who are you either selling or working with on your side to make the entire pie come together?
00:16:46.640 - 00:17:06.618, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so let's start in terms of the customer. There are two customers for this data. There's business customers. Google Maps, for example, is used by millions of businesses. So if you go to Uber, you're using Google Maps. If you go to yelp, you're using Google Maps.
00:17:06.618 - 00:17:47.216, Speaker A: If you go to an insurance company and fill out an application for a car insurance, they're using Google Maps inside of that form. And they're definitely using Google Maps in the back end in a whole variety of ways. So there are literally millions of businesses. So that's our primary customer base, is to serve those customers. Why? Because they pay for it. Right? Like, if PEPC, you know, PEPC has, I think, 60,000 trucks and vehicles that are doing deliveries every single day all over the world, you know, and they have, let's say, you know, every truck, I'm just making these numbers up, but it's like hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue in every single truck. If that delivery can be done in, like, 6 hours versus 7 hours, that's real money.
00:17:47.216 - 00:18:23.858, Speaker A: Right? And so they're willing to pay for, you know, much fresher data. They're willing to pay for much higher quality data that's very, very detailed, especially to their specific use cases. That is the market that we're focused on primarily. There's another market that's many, many billions of dollars of revenue right there. There's another market, which is the consumer. Google Maps monetizes the consumer via ads, via transactions, et cetera. Again, the latest estimate that I heard is about $13 to $15.
00:18:23.858 - 00:18:27.690, Speaker A: Billion a year. Right. So not chump change.
00:18:28.030 - 00:18:28.770, Speaker B: No.
00:18:29.110 - 00:19:00.142, Speaker A: So we will ultimately provide also, like, a consumer navigation app. It's not the first thing that we're going to go do, but it will be something that will be provided to customers. We're already getting a lot of contributors who are saying, look, I'm contributing with your dash cam. It'd be really awesome to have navigation built in. Right? So that will also come, but it will come after all the mapping APIs for businesses. So that's kind of the business. We're not innovating in terms of, like, we're not creating a new market.
00:19:00.142 - 00:19:26.270, Speaker A: Right. In other words, like, there are existing customers that spend on this. The really challenging part is twofold. One is how do you get enough scale, right, for the big customers where the big dollars are so, like a PEPC or Coca Cola or fedex, you know, they operate everywhere. And so if you show up and you're like, hey, I have a great map of LA. They're like, that's cool. I don't know what to do with that.
00:19:26.270 - 00:20:08.488, Speaker A: Yes. You got to show these customers that you have the scale that is interesting, that's relevant for them. And then you got to also show them that you can be able to update, and then you got to show them that you have the great tools that they can actually use and integrate with their products. It is challenging in terms of, there's multiple hurdles that you have to step over in order to become relevant to the big customers where the big dollars are, frankly. Okay, so in terms of the dash, like, okay, contributors. There's two types of contributors. There are people who are out there driving, and they buy this dash cam from us and they drive.
00:20:08.488 - 00:20:36.662, Speaker A: Now here's the important thing is we don't want people driving. Like, do not quit your job for Hivemapper and drive like, that's a bad idea. You can do whatever you want, quite frankly. But I think that's not the way the system was designed to don't even, like, I think it's also a bad idea to consider hivemapper, like, a part time job. That's not what it's designed to do. It's really designed to say, okay, I drive. Right? So I think the thought process you have to go through is, do I drive yes or no? Yes.
00:20:36.662 - 00:21:18.160, Speaker A: Okay. This is relevant to me. Do I drive more than, like, ten minutes a day to the grocery store or to the coffee shop? And I just go to the same two places every single day? Probably not super interesting for you, quite frankly. And so you really have to be like, in this camp where you drive and you drive a bunch, right? So obviously, like Uber drivers and Lyft drivers and truck drivers, that is going to be amazing fit for them. But I probably drive, I don't know, like an hour and a half a day between, like, going to work and then different meetings throughout the day and all that kind of stuff. For me, I think it's relevant still. Then there's the other side, which are map editors.
00:21:18.160 - 00:21:36.528, Speaker A: Map editors don't need a dash cam. They can just sit behind their computer, and there's a whole bunch of tools that they train the AI systems. Like, hey, we think there's a speed limit sign. Tell us whether or not it's a speed limit, and then if so, tell us what the speed limit sign. If it is a speed limit sign, confirm to us that it's 25 mph, that kind of thing.
00:21:36.544 - 00:21:37.260, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:21:38.120 - 00:22:01.010, Speaker A: So they earn honey. There's x amount of honey. There's 10 billion honey tokens. There will only ever be 10 billion honey tokens. And as you help build this map, then you're earning honey tokens. If the map becomes really interesting and really valuable to a lot of customers, then all of our economic incentives are aligned.
00:22:01.510 - 00:22:41.190, Speaker B: Very interesting. No, I love the entire concept, I guess. And ultimately, you said, I think it was helium that inspired some of this crypto component. You weren't super interested in crypto on the early days. You got a little bit excited about ethereum and smart contracts. But what specifically, I guess, about helium that sparked your mind to say, okay, this is actually something interesting that you can do with tokens and the blockchain rails. And how did that kind of inspire you to create hivemapper and get that token piece as well?
00:22:42.730 - 00:23:03.034, Speaker A: I even go further back than helium. What I definitely saw with things like Waze, many people know Waze, obviously, Waze is a crowdsource map. There were two parts of Waze. There's. You download the app, I download the app. We're effectively helping them build the map. Then there's another part of Waze where there's these map editors and there's 30.
00:23:03.034 - 00:23:24.490, Speaker A: According to the Wall Street Journal, there was like 30,000 of them all over the world. They're unpaid, to be clear. There's a tool that they give them, which is very, very tedious to use. They're literally like, going into a map and drawing on the map, saying, like, this is a one way street, this is a bike lane. Very, very tedious kind of work.
00:23:24.650 - 00:23:28.230, Speaker B: And from my. Why do they do this if they're not getting money?
00:23:29.640 - 00:23:34.660, Speaker A: That's a great question, so let me finish. And then we kind of get back to.
00:23:37.680 - 00:23:38.088, Speaker B: Look.
00:23:38.144 - 00:24:05.222, Speaker A: Without those people, there's no map, there's no ways, period. And they ultimately sold to Google for, like, I don't know, 1 billion or 1.3 billion investors made out as they should, employees made out as they should. But the people who actually like building the map and all the data got zero. And I looked at that, I was like, that's messed up. That is totally wrong. And the same thing goes for, by the way, OpenStreetMap today.
00:24:05.222 - 00:25:09.026, Speaker A: OpenStreetMap, there's all these editors that are going in there and editing the map tediously. Now, OSM data is used by many very large and wealthy companies for free. They're not doing anything illegal, to be clear. But I just look at that and say, like, that's wrong, right? So why do they do it? I mean, look, there's people who like maps, right? And they enjoy. It is like, if you get into these tools, if you enjoy maps and you like seeing things kind of being placed in order, there is this kind of mental satisfaction that people get from it. Like, there are some people who like to clean their house, you know, because it, like, you know, at the end of that moment, it feels very good to have a nice, clean house, that everything is in order. And so I think there are similarly, like, people who like to do that because they want to see their neighborhood or their city or their town, you know, look perfect on the map.
00:25:09.178 - 00:26:00.586, Speaker B: Yeah, very interesting. No, I think, I mean, that community ownership part, though, plays very well to, I'd say, the crypto ethos of community involvement, having community kind of own a share of the pie, so to speak, so that they can also contribute to the upside. I think what I'm particularly excited about with Hivemapper and what you're building, and even the distributed physical infrastructure that's kind of now blossoming in crypto is it really aligns all these incentives to do something that's actually useful in the real world. And I think crypto, just because, one, whether it's infrastructure or just applications, are not there today, this is actually building something that people derive value from. And so it's really cool to see all these pieces come together.
00:26:00.778 - 00:26:24.398, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, I broadly agree with that. I've also seen where there are some people within some of these communities that get a little bit too religious about some of the aspects of crypto and then forget, like, wait, wait, wait. We're building like a product, right? That product has to be useful to customers.
00:26:24.534 - 00:26:25.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:25.302 - 00:26:48.774, Speaker A: Right. And so they're so interested in, like, the Dao and the crypto and the governance. And look, some of these things are important. I don't mean to dismiss them entirely, but, like, when you spend 99% of your time talking about that and 1% of your time talking about the product that we're ultimately trying to build here and create, that's useful for customers, then in my view, something's messed up. Right?
00:26:48.822 - 00:26:49.730, Speaker B: I fully agree.
00:26:50.030 - 00:27:12.368, Speaker A: And I told people even within our own community, I was like, look, the map has to be useful to customers. That is the true north here. We could talk about data collection. We could talk about daos. We could talk about all this stuff for a long, long, long time here. By the way. We could still fail if the map is not useful to customers.
00:27:12.544 - 00:28:18.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I just did a podcast yesterday, actually, with a partner from Greylock, and I don't know particularly what it is, but we were speaking to web two founders versus web3. And I think in some sense, just because web two people that have traditionally come from these large companies, such as yourself, maybe have had some skepticism around crypto or just like, what you can actually do with it or the real world use cases, it's been a lot of kind of either younger people, people just coming out of college and almost giving, like, the middle finger to, like, the web two world in crypto. And I think one thing that they're forgetting and that the web two people have really gotten ingrained into them is that product focus, building something that people actually want to use. Because whether it's on crypto, on aws, whether it's on Starlink or wherever it may live, you have to build something useful into that product. And at the end of the day, if that's not solved, everything's shit out of luck.
00:28:18.940 - 00:29:04.956, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think that 100%. Look, I want everybody, I want all of our economic incentives to be aligned. And I think a lot of people misinterpret me when I say the following. I would rather see all this people being all these defi exchanges, tokens, whatever. I think for the first year of a project, and obviously we don't control any of this type of stuff, but I don't think any of that trading amongst people of these tokens is useful or helpful. You got to first build the product. Worrying about this and that in terms of all this crypto prices and all this kind of stuff, it just seems like a huge waste of time and energy for everybody.
00:29:04.956 - 00:29:38.530, Speaker A: Involved in the project. I don't know of any product that comes out of the gate, at least in terms of how you have to go build the data, in terms of the stuff that we're building, or for that matter, helium. It's not useful. It's not useful. Day one of launch, it's not fundamentally useful. Day 90, you have to go build the thing, which obviously the community is helping us do. But I think there's that part of, and I tell people, if you're here to get rich quick, you're in the wrong place.
00:29:38.530 - 00:29:50.330, Speaker A: We're here to build a map first and foremost. And if the map is useful to a lot of customers that care about it, then great, it'll be good.
00:29:52.230 - 00:30:27.890, Speaker B: To that point. Some of the physical infrastructure products that use some crypto rails are not useful in the beginning, and it takes a while to build up that resources to make a product that people want to use. Can you talk about that journey from when you started hidemapper to getting first people using the dash cams to even more recently I've seen on Twitter how many miles that you're actually collecting daily because I think it's a very impressive number. Yeah.
00:30:28.310 - 00:30:53.502, Speaker A: So, no, it's a good number for sure. In terms of making it useful. There's a lot of steps in the process. Obviously, building that fleet of all these different drivers all over the world. That's step one. Then step two is, okay, how do you then, like we were talking about before, how do you then transform all that data into higher value, all the map objects? Right.
00:30:53.606 - 00:30:53.800, Speaker B: I.
00:30:53.830 - 00:31:33.992, Speaker A: And then how do you package up that data so the customers can actually consume it in a very easy way? Those are the tools, those are the map APIs, some of the visualization capabilities, et cetera. So there's really, I think about it in terms of collection, processing, and then customer products and tools. And you got to do all three of those. If you do two out of the three, then it's like, okay, cool. You have some cool data, but you haven't made it easy for customers to use. Customers come to your website, they're fumbling around trying to figure out, how do I buy this thing? How do I use it and integrate it? And it's like, great. So, yes, it is a process that will take.
00:31:33.992 - 00:32:07.460, Speaker A: I tell people, look, Waze was not useful to a lot of people for many, many, many years from the time that it launched. At the time that actually gained worldwide traction was years. And so I think that's the journey that we're on here is like, it will take years. Now, the good part about this is when you get to the other side, we know there's a lot of customers. Right. And we know that a lot of people use maps, and we also know that there's not, like, 50 other competitors on the other side of that.
00:32:10.440 - 00:32:35.400, Speaker B: So building that useful map, how, I guess, did you and the team just start sending out dash cams? Were you personally kind of doing some of the driving? How did you get the first couple hundred people? And then how has the progression of the map data and the collection? Is it to a point now that you would say it's starting to get useful, or have you already surpassed that and you're working with partners that want more and more data?
00:32:35.700 - 00:32:54.940, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the dash cam side, we opened it up for preorders back in April of last year. So we basically said, like, here's the dash cam, here's what it looks like. Here's the capabilities of it. Here's the specs, here's the price, and we got a lot of pre orders. Right. So we were, I guess, lucky in the sense of, you know, it touched the nerve.
00:32:54.940 - 00:33:26.160, Speaker A: Definitely a lot of people from the helium community, like, had heard about us, and so they're like, oh, this is really cool. And so, yeah, like, we definitely had, like, a ton of preorders for that. So that wasn't a challenge for us. I would say the second part of your question is, like, there are certain regions in the world now that are starting to get above. There's three tiers. From a coverage perspective, if you have less than 50% within a region. So a region would be like DC Metro, right? Or Los Angeles Metro.
00:33:26.160 - 00:33:48.210, Speaker A: That's, like, massive Los Angeles. I think it's about 120,000 road kilometers. Manila, to put into context, is only, like, 20,000. So if you get, like, an entire. So if you have at least 50%, then you start to become monetizable. Less than 50%. You're not, like, you don't have anything valuable, quite frankly.
00:33:48.210 - 00:34:07.862, Speaker A: So then you can start to, like, supplement other people's data products. Right. 75% is when you start to get, like, bigger customers. Right. Come into the frame, like, okay, like, you got 75%. But the real. The name of the game here is to get to, like, 99% coverage or better, right where you are, the map for that region.
00:34:07.862 - 00:34:21.050, Speaker A: Like, you don't have to go anywhere else. That is, obviously, you can't do turn by turn direction or a lot of other use cases. On 75% coverage, you need 100% coverage.
00:34:21.390 - 00:35:05.170, Speaker B: Yeah. In this pursuit of data collection, one thing that you mentioned was Google was taking the most expensive approach. Could you go a little bit to, I guess, how Google has either adapted or not adapted that data strategy approach and maybe speaking to with Hivemapper and kind of incentivizing the community to build this data network in aggregate, do you think ultimately the collective sum of these individual people will ultimately surpass the data collection abilities of Google?
00:35:06.830 - 00:35:33.280, Speaker A: I do. Okay. So every Google Street View car costs like roughly half a million dollars between all the sensors on it, between the car itself, the driver, the gas, the car insurance, those things add up pretty quickly. So it's a pretty significant investment. I mean, just the positioning technology on those vehicle costs anywhere between fifteen thousand dollars to thirty thousand dollars. Right. So it is a very expensive cardinal.
00:35:33.280 - 00:36:21.372, Speaker A: And so like, let's say downtown San Francisco or downtown La, they maybe see that every year, every like twelve to 14 months, roughly speaking. If you go like suburban Austin or suburban Chicago, probably every two to three years. If you then go to like Manila or Lagos or Sao Paulo, if they have coverage, every like five to like seven years. There was a road, actually, I tweeted about it, like in Romania we saw a road and Google hadn't updated it in like ten years. And like the road had like totally changed. Like, it went from like this tiny little road to like, I think like a three, you know, there were three lanes now and like, you know, buildings all over and stuff like that. It was like, you know, it was like basically rural when Google saw it.
00:36:21.372 - 00:37:14.210, Speaker A: And there's a lot of places like that in the world, right? Like I was looking at Abu Dhabi because like, there's a bunch of contributors in Abu Dhabi. And I was like, oh, wow, like Google Street View, like maybe only has like 10% of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is like a very wealthy country or a city, at least to the best of my knowledge. So yeah, I think that we will win because we are just seeing a location that much more frequently. And so this is a little bit of a nuanced point. But because you see the best way to think about this in terms of sports analogy, we just have a lot more shots on goal, right? So we are in any given location, we're going to see that 25, 5100 times more frequently. And so you just get a better sense of what's going on there, right? And if you get a better sense of what's going on there, right, you're not obstructed by lighting or a bus or a big truck or whatever.
00:37:14.210 - 00:37:28.208, Speaker A: You're just seeing more of that location, and then you can build a better map. And so, yeah, we think that numbers is really important, but also, maybe just as importantly as doing it at a.
00:37:28.224 - 00:37:53.690, Speaker B: Very, very low cost, definitely to, I guess, continue some of the exponential growth on the mapping side that you're seeing, is it just getting the dash cam into more people's cars, or is it primarily getting people driving more? What's the missing piece? Or. Not so much the missing piece, but what can kind of accelerate the gas pedal?
00:37:54.030 - 00:38:30.792, Speaker A: So, if you look at the map and where we have, like, the vast majority of coverage right now, it's like the US, Europe, South Korea, and a couple other countries, right? Like Abu Dhabi, whatever. But we don't have a lot of coverage in India yet. Right. Or Brazil or Nigeria is growing for some odd reason, but there's a lot of other, like, countries in Africa where we don't have a lot of coverage. Why is that? It all comes down to the cost of the dash cam. Dash cam. And I, you know, even though we haven't made a profit on this program, like, people accuse us of, like, oh, you guys are like, you know, taking a lot of money off this.
00:38:30.792 - 00:39:05.190, Speaker A: We have not made, like, in terms of all the engineering costs that went into that, you know, assembly, manufacturing costs, we have not made a profit on that. That wasn't the intent of it. But it is an expensive dash cam, right? It's like $550. So, yes, bringing the price, $550, put into context, an Uber driver in Brazil, in Sao Paulo specifically makes $500 a month. So, yes, bringing the cost of the dash cam down is really, really important and critical for us.
00:39:06.090 - 00:39:21.020, Speaker B: Makes sense, I guess. IPhones or any upgrades over time, just the number of product iterations that you'll have do with the dash cam will just bring that price down, allowing more access to more people.
00:39:21.960 - 00:39:33.860, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I think we'll build one more dash cam, but we're also going to open this up to other hardware partners to go build their own. And there's already a couple hardware partners that want to go do that.
00:39:34.200 - 00:39:35.740, Speaker B: Amazing helium.
00:39:36.120 - 00:39:51.410, Speaker A: Definitely scaled a lot faster by having all these partners build their own dash cam, which was great. Sorry. Now they're dash cam. They're hotspots. So we will do the same thing, which is we will definitely want partners building their own versions with their own features and capabilities.
00:39:52.190 - 00:40:19.620, Speaker B: Makes a lot of sense on one thing that the blockchain people do love to debate, and I think I'm guilty of this as well, is kind of the infrastructure side of things. You started out on Solana, but there's numerous kind of different platforms or blockchains to build upon. How, ultimately, did you go through that product process and evaluating the different options and then settle on Solana?
00:40:20.320 - 00:40:46.770, Speaker A: Look, I'm not religious about this stuff. You and I talked about this briefly before we got on. It's like, I just look at it in terms of, okay, how do I de, ultimately, as an entrepreneur, what are you trying to do? You're trying to de risk the business, de risk the project. And so, like, I mean, I want to de risk it to the point where it's like, I'm no longer necessary. Right. You know, and so they could be like, hey, Ariel, you know, we're done, you know, with you. Thank you very much.
00:40:46.770 - 00:41:24.782, Speaker A: Like, you could go away and, like, the project would still be awesome, and it'll still, like, run and do everything that's, like, kind of, like, where I want to get this to. And I think that we will get it to that point. So I just look in terms of risk, like, do I want to take on the risk of, like, in the case of Ethereum, like, these massive gas fees? And I looked at that, and I was like, that's crazy. We won't be able to do half the stuff they want to go do. I think we're, what, three and a half, four months in, and we're already up to on the blockchain, like, 11 million transactions. I mean, doing 11 million transactions on Ethereum would be basically bankrupt the company. Right? Bankrupt the entire project.
00:41:24.782 - 00:41:46.490, Speaker A: So it's like, why do that? That's stupid. And so that was my primary motivator. I think it was good. And obviously, like, Anatole and Raj have been very helpful to us. I think they also get this whole category of deep in decentralized physical infrastructure. Render is moving over to Solana. Helium just did.
00:41:46.490 - 00:42:18.880, Speaker A: There's some other projects that are also building on Solana as well. So I think they get it. And then the other thing is, look, I know people can do. They point to Polygon, but if you're a project and then you're doing your rewards in Polygon, to the best of my knowledge, then, like, when somebody actually, like, wants to, like, you know, go to coinbase or something like that and then use those. Those tokens from your project, there has to be, like a trans. Like a transfer, right? So it's like, it's pretty complicated, like, these level ones. And level two is nonsense, in my opinion.
00:42:19.040 - 00:42:19.640, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:19.760 - 00:42:25.940, Speaker A: And so, I mean, maybe Ethereum will solve this problem? I don't know. I don't, I don't track this that closely.
00:42:26.440 - 00:43:15.620, Speaker B: I wish more builders had the point of view that you do because I think it's the most practical one. And I think it's definitely the view that I hold as well, is just building on the chain, any chain that ultimately serves your use case the best and allows you to build the best possible product. And I think today, just because we are early in the entire industry, there's lots of debates, and although they can be entertaining sometimes, they're often talking past each other. We forget about building the actual product and what you can do from the product side. And so it's refreshing to hear that, I mean, the practical kind of voice one, and just making and trying to create the best possible product experience.
00:43:16.480 - 00:44:07.458, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, like, look for the, whatever, 30,000 users that comes in and, like, starts contributing on Hivemapper. I would be willing to bet a lot of money that they will never ask me, or for that matter, anybody else, what blockchain is this running on? They're like an Uber driver or whatever in some location and they're just interacting with the app and there's this dash cam, and they don't even know what that means. I just think it's like nobody asked if you go to Reddit or something like that. Do you care if it runs on AwS or Azure or something like that? Like, I don't think you do. Like, obviously the people that read it really care, right? And the employees care and the engineers care and the CEO cares because there's a bunch of costs associated with that. Right.
00:44:07.458 - 00:44:10.310, Speaker A: But, like, the users do not care at all.
00:44:10.690 - 00:44:33.580, Speaker B: Totally agree. Totally agree. Maybe, like, speaking to this entire category of DPN, what are kind of your thoughts more broadly on, like, some of these other projects and spinning up or just being involved in this category in this ecosystem, I guess. Where do you see it go long term?
00:44:34.360 - 00:45:04.238, Speaker A: I mean, look, I think it is probably one of the most interesting and exciting parts of crypto right now. I'll say something slightly controversial. I was a little disappointed that a 16 z, that they did their crypto report. I don't know if you saw this. It did not include Dpin. It was pretty disappointing because, I mean, look, what are those things that are fundamentally useful in the world in terms of the larger economy? Okay. Wireless networks, really important.
00:45:04.238 - 00:45:29.994, Speaker A: Maps, really important. Energy, really important to people's lives. Car insurance, really important to people's lives. So there's a whole set of things that you can start to build and deepen that are critical in massive industries, in people's lives. And so, like, to me, that is the most interesting thing. Like, I don't mean, I don't, I'm not gonna shit on, like, nfts and art. I think they have a role to play in the world.
00:45:29.994 - 00:46:21.790, Speaker A: You know, I mean, you know, people care about art all the time. They have for, you know, thousands upon thousands of years. But, you know, it's a very speculative market. It's not a massive market. And so, sure, it'll have a role to play, but it doesn't impact people's lives in any sort of, like, very critical, day to day practical way is probably the better way to say it. And so that's what interests me about deepin as a category. Look, I think the people who are coming in, these kind of pioneers, quite frankly, and helping build these networks, I think if they have patience, I think that many of them will start to just feel like I didn't fully appreciate this.
00:46:21.790 - 00:46:47.850, Speaker A: People feel useful when they're mapping for hivemapper. Yes. They're earning these rewards. So all of our economic incentives are aligned and they're helping build the product. And so as people use the product, they'll be compensated for that and stuff like that. But there's another aspect of this which is like, look, you want to feel a part of something bigger in your life, right? And you want to feel useful, right?
00:46:47.930 - 00:46:48.402, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:48.506 - 00:46:59.650, Speaker A: And so a lot of people now say to me is like, look, if, like, I'm driving in another car, like my wife's car, that is not the dash cam, I feel like I'm missing something out. I don't feel like I'm as useful as I ought to be.
00:46:59.810 - 00:47:00.434, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:00.562 - 00:47:38.320, Speaker A: And I think that's a really powerful, like, psychological thing. And I think obviously, in terms of just from an economic perspective, why should there only be one or two maps in the world? Why should there only be in the United States, what, three wireless carriers? I think they introduced competition in a new and different way, where the people who are actually building these products get to then enjoy the economic upside associated with actually building something useful and valuable for customers.
00:47:38.770 - 00:48:17.232, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I love that. And I think sometimes, I mean, crypto more broadly is experimenting. Lots of experiments are going to fail. But I think what I am excited about is, again, these real world use case products, things that actually bring value to everybody's lives. And I think having some aspects of crypto is interesting, but it's not that. Crypto itself is the product. Crypto enables you to create the product to make a better experience, but it's not the product itself.
00:48:17.232 - 00:48:28.752, Speaker B: And so from that, just even like flipping, that has been very interesting to watch. And I'm very excited about the category as well.
00:48:28.896 - 00:49:45.368, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, the crypto industry as a whole did themselves a disservice, right? Because look, in the web two dot world, and I saw this in Yahoo search days and Google obviously deals with this every single day. There are a tremendous number of scams. There are tremendous number of bad actors in the web two dot world, but you don't really come across them that often because in this case, Google search, when Yahoo search had real market share, we would basically suppress them, right? And so it would be very, very hard. Obviously there's like email spammers and all that kind of stuff as well, where there's a lot of bad actors. But for the most part, the web two industry, like did a fairly good job of suppressing the bad actors. The crypto world industry, for whatever reason, did not do that, right? I mean, look, I mean, FTX, like one of the major, like, you know, figures in the web3 world was a bad actor himself. And so, like that has to be the crypto industry absolutely has to like filter that shit out, right? And I'm sure, look, it'll always exist, right? There will always be like a motivation, but, you know, you shouldn't be able to find them, right? Like, nobody should promote them.
00:49:45.368 - 00:50:21.860, Speaker A: Like, stop talking about them, don't promote them, don't give them any attention. Make sure that they never show up on any social media or whatever it is. That's the way you get rid of it, right? And because the industry didn't get rid of it, like, now you have people like Gensler, he has a lot of ammunition, right? Because he can point to this bad actor and that boy a bad actor and that bad actor and the politicians are like, oh, yeah, those are bad, right? I mean, you and I would say they're bad as well, right? But it's, you know, kind of now we're in this phase of like everyone wants to throw the baby out with the bathwater because of the prior sins of the industry.
00:50:22.480 - 00:51:15.580, Speaker B: Definitely, definitely. Maybe. I mean, speaking to, I think it's been a slow trickle and I think bull markets ultimately help facilitate this, is just bringing new people in. But there's still, I would say very, I would like to see more web two engineers, builders, product minds come into the web3 world from. You obviously made that jump and now are building something very interesting in this space. What would your advice or words of wisdom be to web two people that have the point of view that, like Gensler, that crypto is bad and it's just used for frauds. Anything that you could say to maybe clean the slate and advise them to look at the industry differently?
00:51:16.800 - 00:51:48.854, Speaker A: I mean, look, it's hard, but I think that the, I think it's incumbent upon projects like Hivemapper and others to demonstrate real utility. I'll give you a very specific example. A developer that I respect. He's like, okay, let me play around with Hivemapper and stuff like that. The thing that really got him interested was he didn't have to for the API. You could just go and hit our API. It was instantly, okay, I got results back and that was useful.
00:51:48.854 - 00:52:26.540, Speaker A: And that's interesting. You know, oh, I could like go install this dash cam and like, I could sort of like go help build a map. Like, to him, the crypto and the honey rewards was, you know, kind of less interesting. You know, he's a developer, so he was more interested in the utility of it. Right. And so I think he had come from this perspective, I was like, oh, it's a bunch of like, you know, crypto people and they like, want to over monetize everything way, way too early. And I think the more projects that can demonstrate easy to use utility very, very, very quickly, the better off we're going to be.
00:52:26.540 - 00:52:58.724, Speaker A: Even Twitter in the very early days, it was failing a lot. There was the fail whale, whatever it is, but you could still sign up for it and use it and see the value. It may not have spoken to you in terms of how you wanted to use social media, but it was clear that there was something interesting going on there even in a very, very early phase. And so I think the more that we can demonstrate to what is the underlying utility here and how easy it is to then go and use that, the better off we're going to be.
00:52:58.892 - 00:54:01.324, Speaker B: I fully agree. I mean, it's been interesting. We're now at that point in the bear market, and just because crypto often or historically has been very cyclical, that people are questioning what is the industry doing, what are the useful products? And when I talk with different investors or LP's, really, there are two things that they're the most excited now is one is stablecoins and just stablecoin transfers and kind of the innovations around being able to send money globally fairly cheaply, but also the deep end category as a whole because they can point to that. And say this is useful. It is doing something in the real world, and I can see it. A lot of the other distributed applications that are being built on blockchains have either struggled or just a little bit too early in their lifecycle to see some of that real world adoption. But they can articulate and see the DPN actually coming alive.
00:54:01.452 - 00:54:25.126, Speaker A: Yeah, this is maybe a little bit controversial. I think that there's way too much investor time and money spent on, like, very low levels of the blockchain. You know, like infrastructure. Yeah, infrastructure, yeah. So I think Solana is great. Like, Solana has its capital. Like, you know, it's a, it's a serious project run by serious people.
00:54:25.126 - 00:54:50.616, Speaker A: You know, it has a great community of developers around it. Like, it will continue to innovate. Right. Do we don't need, like, five other things trying to compete with Solana. Right. It just feels like it's just like a waste of time and a waste of money, quite frankly. But I think if you were to look, I haven't done this, maybe you can do this, or somebody, you know, can do this that says, look at all the crypto dollars.
00:54:50.616 - 00:54:57.712, Speaker A: I think that they would still be focused much more on crypto infrastructure, basically. Like, the way I think about it is like, crypto for crypto.
00:54:57.856 - 00:54:58.580, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:59.140 - 00:55:10.640, Speaker A: And I think that's a mistake. But I'm not an investor, so maybe they know something that I don't. But I have no interest in being an investor either, so it's not my game.
00:55:11.340 - 00:56:11.640, Speaker B: Yeah, investors are funny, I think. I mean, in large part just because there's actually so few real world or even addresses interacting on chain. Even, like, the more popular things on Ethereum have low 5 million, 10 million lifetime active accounts ever interacting with them. And from the web, two world, that's like rounding air for daily active accounts using their products. And so investors are very keen to try new shiny objects and hopefully be early. But no, I fully agree that real world applications, whether it's built in the physical world or even just adding value in our digital lives, are the things that we should actually progress towards, I guess. Wrapping up the podcast for 2023, what are you most excited about, either at Hivemapper or for the industry as a whole?
00:56:13.700 - 00:57:00.940, Speaker A: So I'll talk about the theme. There's a lot of things that are exciting at Hivemapper, for sure, but the thing that's my little pet project at Hivemapper right now is this thing called buzz. So what you do, it's kind of like waze reports, but with images, right? So the idea is, like, in the app, there's a button, you hit buzz if you see, like, a traffic or there's construction or there's, like, flooding on a road or whatever it is. And so we launched it in, like, this kind of internal beta, very, very limited set of people. And, like, we're starting to see some of the stuff that's coming in, and it's just, like, mind blowing, right? Like, what happens in the world every single day, right? The world is a very, very big place. It's a very messy place. And, like, you know, every time somebody hits a buzz, they're kind of, like, pointing out to us, like, look at this crazy shit.
00:57:00.940 - 00:57:32.870, Speaker A: And so, like, there's some crazy stuff that you're starting to see there. So I think that's, like, pretty fascinating. But it's also really helpful as well, right? It's not just like, you know, it's helpful in terms of like, oh, wow, that's a big crash over there, right? As you take another route, it's like, it's not gonna get cleared for a while. Oh, wow, that's like, a lot of flooding that's happening there, right? Oh, I'm going to, like, tahoe to go ski. I can start to really understand what am I going to deal with on the roads as I get up there. All that kind of stuff. So it's fun, but it's also useful as well.
00:57:32.870 - 00:58:07.858, Speaker A: So that's the thing I'm personally excited about. There's a lot of other stuff that we're doing as well. Look, I think the big challenge for the deep end category as a whole is that I think it's gotten the attention of a relatively, like, if you look at crypto, you go to a big crypto conference, you're gonna have a lot of defi people there talking, you know, defi stuff. You're gonna have a lot of gaming and gaming stuff and NFT stuff. Like, deepin is still gonna be like a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of that industry. Right? Sorry. Of that conference.
00:58:07.858 - 00:58:33.710, Speaker A: And it doesn't matter. You go to like, whatever conference you go to, like, the deep pin people are still like maybe 2% or 5%. And so I think the challenge and the opportunity for us is like, how does it become 30%, right? Like, it has to. It needs to reflect the broader economy. The broader economy. You look at the wireless industry, you look at the geo mapping industry, you look at the energy industry. Those are massive.
00:58:33.710 - 00:59:01.652, Speaker A: It doesn't reflect that. I don't know why that is. What needs to change. But to me, that's the big challenge and the big exciting opportunity as well. Either maybe some of those people need to go away and you need to bring new people in, or you have to change people's minds. In terms of why things like deepen are so critical for the future of crypto.
00:59:01.836 - 00:59:19.304, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in terms of maybe some entertainment value on Twitter is getting API hooked up to the buzz and just tweeting out every time something interesting happens. Definitely get a lot of attention.
00:59:19.472 - 01:00:04.130, Speaker A: It's funny because I think that's, like, so much more interesting and so much more relevant and so much more, like, yeah, just like you said, entertaining than, like, defi, right. Like, I go to some of these defi conferences and I was like, oh, what do you work on? And somebody, I'm gonna like, maybe shit on DeFi here a little bit, but, like, like, somebody explains to me what they do, and I was like, I don't. I understood the words you said, but actually don't understand, like, everything. Yeah, I'm not a defi expert, but I know enough about it to understand how it works at a broad level. And so then I'm like, wow, this is nuts. But there's a lot of people who are like that, who are in that world. And so, yes, things like maps and things like buzz are just so much more entertaining and easy to understand that.
01:00:04.130 - 01:00:06.734, Speaker A: Yeah, that'd be pretty cool if we did that. We should do that.
01:00:06.902 - 01:00:58.538, Speaker B: That would be cool. And then I think the second thing is just continuing to tell your story. I think it's hard because whether it's the debates on blockchains and l two s or subchains or nfts, defi, everybody's kind of competing for attention. And the hard thing is kind of, it's almost whoever screams the loudest gets the attention. But I think even telling your story in more broad formats like this and being able to share the useful things that are actually happening and creating real world value is what I. But hopefully, I think we both agree, we'll ultimately get bigger presence at conferences. And I think ultimately just allow the category and even outside of that, the entire blockchain industry to scale to very impressive numbers.
01:00:58.714 - 01:01:13.060, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think it's bound to happen. Right. Because ultimately, crypto has to reflect in terms of time and energy and dollars has to reflect the broader economy. Right. Otherwise, we're just going to become this niche little, you know, thing off to the side.
01:01:13.400 - 01:01:35.944, Speaker B: True, true. Well, truly appreciate you coming on the podcast. This was one of the more fun and exciting chats that I've had in a long time. And the fact that it's actually building something in the real world and people are using that and appreciate the value, I think is even more rare in crypto. So thank you for coming on, and thank you for building out. Hivemapper thank you.
01:01:35.992 - 01:01:36.830, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. Mandev.
