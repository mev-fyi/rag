00:00:00.200 - 00:00:33.930, Speaker A: Brown is a trader, my co founder. I met him at the skatepark, which is a really interesting story to build a company around the analytics of Derbitz Options market. And so that's how Genesis volatility was born. We raised two funding rounds and ended up selling to Amber data in October of 2022. There's a lot of, like, there's kind of fomo dynamics where it's like people care about crypto and crypto's moving higher and then people just don't care about it. On the way down from the outside, you look at all these other projects and you're thinking like, wow. Like, they seem to raise money.
00:00:33.930 - 00:00:49.910, Speaker A: Like, no problem. Why is it so hard for us? My final conclusion is that when we actually closed this round and finally we're able to close, was that it? Probably from the outside to everyone else, it probably looks like we just raised around like it was easy, you know, from the grasses, Greener, like the people who are in it is probably always a ground.
00:00:53.250 - 00:01:06.490, Speaker B: I'm super excited to be joined today by Greg, the founder of Genesis volatility. We have a mutual friend and so she spoke very highly of you and really looking forward to the podcast today.
00:01:07.790 - 00:01:09.530, Speaker A: Thanks, Logan. Happy to be here.
00:01:10.190 - 00:01:29.890, Speaker B: I always find everybody's journey into crypto and how they fell down the crypto rabbit hole. Super unique. Traders approach it from one aspect, engineers approach from another. So could you talk about a little bit about your own personal journey and ultimately what led you to get involved into crypto?
00:01:31.070 - 00:02:02.216, Speaker A: Yeah, happy to. So basically, my background is as a trader. I was a proprietary trader in Chicago for many years. I started out in New York as an intern at SMB Capital. And then after graduating college, I was trading treasuries at Chopper Trading in Chicago and later joined DRW and traded there for a while as well. In late 2015, I actually quit trading at DRW to trade my own book in the crypto space. That's actually where I met my, or when I met my co founder.
00:02:02.216 - 00:02:57.864, Speaker A: I met him at the skatepark, which is a really interesting story. He like completely shreds and I was asking him if I could take a picture of his tricks and we started talking and I introduced him to Ethereum. So I first discovered crypto actually while I was still in college. In 2012, me and Linda Shea, who actually runs crypto hedge fund called Scale of Capital now we decided to do a research report on bitcoin. We downloaded tour, went on a dark web, check out what was bitcoin and where was it being used and at the time, I was a little freaked out by it, just because of the dark web and stuff like that. So I ended up not investing in it. This was $7 bitcoin, and it wasn't until later in 2013, while I was trading treasuries, I was still following crypto at a distance, and I saw bitcoin break $200 all time high for the first time.
00:02:57.864 - 00:03:35.208, Speaker A: So you sort of buy that breakout. It's kind of my thinking from a technical perspective. And that's when I first started actually invested in bitcoin. And so I was basically in the crypto space since 2013. When I met my co founder in 2015, I introduced him to Ethereum. He wanted to learn more, and so me and him basically started doing research and investing together in the space, like researching icos and things like that, and trying our hand at that. And later in 2019, we decided to launch crypto options analytics platform.
00:03:35.208 - 00:04:11.456, Speaker A: I had just discovered bitcoin when they listed Ethereum back in April 2019, and I was really excited by this market. I was trading options for a long time. My background was in options. To me, crypto options were this new innovative space where there's a lot of pricing inefficiencies, which there still are today. That was a really interesting portal into that market. Me and Pat, my co founder, decided to build a company around the analytics of dare bits options market. And so that's how Genesis volatility was born.
00:04:11.456 - 00:04:24.340, Speaker A: We incorporated in January 2020. We raised two funding rounds and ended up selling to Amber data in October of 2022. And so that was a really exciting time.
00:04:24.680 - 00:04:45.240, Speaker B: Amazing, lots of to parse apart, but I think just given your time in the market and being involved and crypto since the very early days, kind of Ethereum ICO, even bitcoin, what have been some of your biggest learnings just from going through multiple cycles?
00:04:46.980 - 00:05:28.020, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting perspective. So the early ICO days, I ended up not investing in the Ethereum ICO and did the master coin ico instead. So that was a disaster and huge regret. But once Ethereum started trading, I finally got in. So one of the things that really stuck out to me, and I'm sort of an ETH maxi as opposed to bitcoin Maxi. But to me, bitcoin had paved the way for the viability of a digital asset. And then when I discovered Ethereum, Ethereum already had a predecessor, so I already knew that market caps could reach a certain level because of what bitcoin had done.
00:05:28.020 - 00:06:14.772, Speaker A: But then Ethereum was such a better mousetrap so before the Ethereum ICo, people used to talk about colored coins, which are basically like smart contract coins. But essentially, long story short, it's a lot of the capabilities that ETH provides. And so to me, that sort of base layer infrastructure play made a lot more sense. And I knew that the market caps could already go crazy. So that was an easier trade than just buying bitcoin as a new asset class. So that was one of the first things in early asset cycles that seemed really interesting to me. And then in price cycles, one of the things that we'll notice a lot is that when crypto is rallying, this was true in 2013, when we rallied up to $1,000.
00:06:14.772 - 00:07:10.504, Speaker A: In November 2013, or whatever it was, we got a wired article about bitcoin. There's a lot of excitement about bitcoin. Then the next two years was this huge bear market where bitcoin ended up bought like $200 again. And it wasn't until the 2017 bull market that prices really had another major run up. There's a lot of FOMO dynamics, where it's people care about crypto, and crypto is moving higher, and then people just don't care about it on their way down in traditional assets, a lot of the panic and the enthusiasm, but enthusiasm is not the right word. A lot of the talk around the markets are during market crashes. 2008, everyone was an economist, and no one really cared about the markets in 2010 and 2011 or whatever.
00:07:10.504 - 00:07:48.110, Speaker A: 2012, there's a little bit of those dynamics that are flipped on its head. So those are some things that are really interesting that actually translate really nicely into the volume markets. So the volume markets, to me, have a few different regimes. We actually just talked about this recently in a report. And what we're trying to quantify are sort of like these positive volume regimes, where calls are more expensive than puts versus negative volume regimes where puts are more expensive than calls. And then the different sort of levels of implied volatility, total in total. And so to me, this mirrors really nicely with those cycles that you see in the spot market or the cash markets.
00:07:48.690 - 00:08:26.750, Speaker B: Interesting. I definitely want to come back to the volatility aspect as well. One thing that you said there earlier was around you got into the space when bitcoin was the only asset to really play in within crypto, then definitely colored coins came along, which was trying to expand on that. And then ultimately ethereum. And now you're much more of an ethereum fan when you're looking at these different assets. How do you personally kind of approach them? Do you approach them from, like, a technical point, from a trading point. I'm curious.
00:08:28.130 - 00:09:16.690, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. So, back in the day, here's how I thought about it. The bond market is five times as big as the stock market. If I pick out one stock market out of the whole entire stock market, call it Apple, well, that market cap at the time was like a trillion dollars, and then the entire crypto market was a fraction of that. And so to me, it was like such an easy kind of valuation ladder to say, okay, there's so much room for growth here that when you're buying a total market cap of, call it $100 billion at the time for crypto, if that even, it seemed like there's no ceiling to the asset. So that's kind of an initial, back of the envelope sort of valuation metric that I was using a lot. And then from a technical analysis perspective, a lot of people hate technical analysis.
00:09:16.690 - 00:10:07.970, Speaker A: Technical analysis, the way that I define it, it's not really about telling the future. It's more about finding risk points or inflection points for risk management. So, for example, let's look at that $200 level again. Well, when you're making new all time highs above $200, $200, that level is important. There's a lot of significance to it, because it means that prices have garnered enough interest and new entrants into the market that, like, the all time high level is a good inflection point for, like, I want to get in here. And this is like a new paradigm, a new environment of price potential, price appreciation. You can also kind of do the same analysis on the flip side.
00:10:07.970 - 00:11:10.338, Speaker A: So, like, when we had the bear market in 2015 and 2016, and the price low was 200, you can tell, you can give yourself the hard stop of 200 saying, okay, this is the previous bear market low. Like, assuming this asset has real uses and people really do believe in it, we shouldn't go back below those levels, because that's an old paradigm, that those prices reflect an old paradigm. And so, to me, that's kind of how I like to use technical analysis. I like to use it as levels or thresholds that shouldn't be violated, so to speak. So that's kind of how I use that aspect in the market. Then lastly, from an options market, and I'm sure we'll talk about this later, but you can also look at the statistical distributions of what the option prices are implying. So right now, in 2023, call options are more expensive than put options even six months out.
00:11:10.338 - 00:11:36.230, Speaker A: That's implying that the option market is expecting more upside surprises, more than downside surprises. For the next six months, volume shocks will be on the positive spot side. And so those types of assumptions, whether you disagree with the options market and you think it's an opportunity or you agree with it and you want to get long spot because of it, they all give us like really interesting insights that you can sort of make your thesis around.
00:11:37.170 - 00:12:09.070, Speaker B: Interesting, very interesting. I don't get the opportunity to talk with very many traders, so this will be a good conversation and hopefully excited to learn a lot on maybe before jumping into ultimately how you started your company and even the volatility report that you guys put out today. I'm curious on your point of view, because I know, I think which chain is Darabit running on for their options market.
00:12:10.290 - 00:12:23.610, Speaker A: So they're CFI exchange and they mostly trade Ethereum and bitcoin, so you can send Ethereum directly to them. So they have wallets on the Ethereum chain, and then they also have wallets on the bitcoin chain.
00:12:24.030 - 00:12:47.480, Speaker B: Okay, I know some products are ultimately trying to do this kind of options market on chain. What is your point of view to try to ultimately get some of these things that have existed in the web two world with options market and putting them on more crypto native rails?
00:12:48.420 - 00:13:25.856, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. Anyone who follows me knows that my favorite option protocol is Lyra. The reason why I like that, I like Lyra a lot, is because there's two approaches to making options on chain. One of them is we take the dear bit model and we replicate it on chain. Some protocols have done a really good job of that. Zeta protocol has done a really good job of that. Then there's this other perspective, which is we don't want to make something that's exactly like dare bit, because the way that people interact with on chain protocols is different than how to interact with, say, dare bit.
00:13:25.856 - 00:14:24.998, Speaker A: And so to me, that's the Lyra protocol. And so again, the predecessor sort of mindset, uniswap, is an on chain Dex that works very differently than, say, what was the early one, Delta exchange or something like that, which was a book limit style. The way that people interact on chain is just not the same. There's a lot of demand for passive liquidity, providing that is positive expectancy or positive expected value. It's really hard to set up infrastructure to become a market maker on a good platform with low latency, such as dare bit. I mean, they're the best, but that alone is a lot of work and then forget about doing that on chain where you have latency, throughput issues, all that stuff and transaction costs and things like that. So to me, we just need to think about a different model.
00:14:24.998 - 00:14:53.492, Speaker A: It's like we don't need to just do the exact same thing in a new place. That's kind of boring. I want to do something different that provides a similar level of service in a different place. And that's really where sort of a smart Amm model like Lyra comes in really nicely. LP's can become passive market makers. The AMN has such smart logic that it delta hedges data reprices. It has all these elements in it that make it so LP's don't essentially get screwed.
00:14:53.492 - 00:15:27.080, Speaker A: Then from the taker perspective, you can both buy to open options or sell to open options, which is very much similar to a classic exchange experience. But now you're trading against an amm. And some of the things that amms provide that traditional market makers don't provide is that in fast markets. And we saw this with the FTX collapse, the Amm was still standing there making markets. So to me, this is new innovation to get a similar experience, and that's what really excites me. So to me, I think they're doing a good job.
00:15:27.380 - 00:15:32.572, Speaker B: And are they deployed on Ethereum layer one or so?
00:15:32.596 - 00:15:34.852, Speaker A: They're on optimism and on arbitrage.
00:15:34.996 - 00:15:37.828, Speaker B: Okay, interesting, interesting.
00:15:37.884 - 00:15:44.760, Speaker A: Very cool. Just full disclosure, I own some of their tokens, so I mean, I'm not uninvested in them.
00:15:45.470 - 00:16:25.630, Speaker B: Interesting. No. Do you? So are you? Yeah. Instead of maybe going more technical, let me kind of shift the conversation. I would love to learn. I mean, so you ultimately we're talking about genesis and volatility and ultimately how you ended up creating this company and really using dare bet as kind of a source to pull data. Could you talk a little bit more about that journey and ultimately what was kind of led up to that and maybe going a little bit deeper into just some of the offerings that the company had as well.
00:16:26.450 - 00:16:58.666, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Happy to chat about the founders journey. So, I mean, for any founders who probably are out there, had a similar experience where when you're deciding to get started, it's a little bit scary. I think one of my most encouraging phone calls was with Luke over at dare bit. So we made like a basic mvp or minimal viable product, or like just a kind of a beta product that we hosted locally on our computers. And we give him a call and said, hey, can we meet with you? He's like, yeah, sure. And so he didn't know us at all.
00:16:58.666 - 00:17:27.020, Speaker A: We're just some random people. And I said, look at all these charts we built using your data. We want to build a business around your data. Are we allowed to resell your data and build a business around it? He completely gave us his blessing. He allowed us to resell their, but allowed us to resell their data so we can actually have a viable product. Now in my mind, just seemed like this is going to be easy. Like, thousands of people are going to sign up for this, and overnight this is going to be a really good product.
00:17:27.020 - 00:18:10.914, Speaker A: It was actually a lot more of a grind than I thought from a customer perspective. We decided to follow a lot of different strategies. I think we had a really good product and I had good experience in the markets already, so I could talk about it. But the idea is how do we capture market share? We have a product in the market that has fancy charts and stuff like that. We built a Twitter, and so we decided to basically talk about trading ideas or insights that I found in the market and put them on Twitter. We built a weekly newsletter about four months in from incorporating. That gave us a weekly recap of volatility markets or the crypto volatility markets.
00:18:10.914 - 00:18:56.632, Speaker A: And then lastly we started a YouTube channel to explain crypto options. Now, one of the things that's really interesting is that crypto options is pretty niche. Like, crypto is niche, volatility is niche, and then crypto volatility is like the niche of the niche, and then go into defi, crypto options. Like that is the tip of the iceberg as far as nicheness goes. And so in a way, that's really good because there's not a lot of people who can compete in that pool, but it's also a very small pool. So I truly believe that crypto options, both in the Defi and c five space, are going to have a lot of growth and are going to be here to stay for the long run. So getting a head start is really good because you get to build networks, you get to talk to people, get to get your name out there and things like that.
00:18:56.632 - 00:19:14.460, Speaker A: So those are some things that really excited me. So this is about six months in. We have sort of all those elements in place. And then we decided to raise a funding round. So we raised a $3 million valuation funding round for our first round. And that was hard. It was a really, really hard round to close.
00:19:14.460 - 00:19:36.610, Speaker A: And it's so interesting because from the outside, you look at all these other projects and you're thinking like, wow. Like, they seem to raise money. Like, no problem. Why is it so hard for us? We got a product in market. We actually have revenue, we have a reputation. We're really working closely with the exchanges. And so it was a little bit perplexing, and it's actually one of those things.
00:19:36.610 - 00:20:08.592, Speaker A: My final conclusion is that probably when we actually closed this round, we finally were able to close it, and it was led by nascent, which is a crypto vc in space. Very thankful for them. We finally closed it. We basically, my conclusion was that it probably from the outside to everyone else, it probably looks like we just raced around like it was easy. And so from the grass is greener, like, the people who are in it is probably always a grind is kind of my final conclusion. So that was kind of our first year. I was really happy about that.
00:20:08.592 - 00:20:27.436, Speaker A: We were able to, we didn't pay ourselves anything, which is basically how it works. But after closing around, we were able to pay ourselves, like 30 grand a year. So I was pretty happy with that. Thirty k and then hire someone else to help out. So that was really cool. And then we, so I'm happy to just, should I keep going on this or.
00:20:27.508 - 00:20:54.792, Speaker B: No, keep going. I think, like, these. Yeah, I would definitely echo your sentiments that, like, everybody views it from the outside, and they're like, oh, yes. Like, they raised that round. Like, how they look, how they do that so easily. And I think these stories are important for founders to hear because it's not always that case. I would say those are the outliers, not the normal.
00:20:54.792 - 00:20:56.300, Speaker B: So please continue.
00:20:57.240 - 00:21:24.016, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Cool. So then our second year was a lot, lot smoother because we were able to raise the second round with a lot more ease. But basically, after closing our first round, we continued to iterate out our product and get more of a foothold in the space. And then we onboarded some really kick ass advisors that I really like a lot. They're kind of ogs in the traditional space. And that sort of helped us close our second round.
00:21:24.016 - 00:21:44.616, Speaker A: So again, we just continue to build a reputation. We launched our own podcast in crypto options space, and then we went out to raise another round. And the crypto market was pretty hot. This is 2021 crypto. I mean, bitcoin was like past 50k. It had just touched 70k. Everyone's talking about 100 grand bitcoins, things like that.
00:21:44.616 - 00:22:26.502, Speaker A: So it's a different environment. And this time, instead of a total grind, we had an oversubscribed round. So at this point, we had built enough reputation, and there's enough momentum behind us that I think we're two and a half times oversubscribed, and we really got to pick out our investors of choice. And so Delphi Digital is our number one choice investor. This guy Avi over there, he was, like, definitely a really cool guy, and I was super happy to have him lead our round. So he did that all our past investors tacked on, and we got a couple more investors, and we ended up raising a $3 million round. So the first round was 300,000, the second round was 3 million.
00:22:26.502 - 00:23:07.256, Speaker A: And so it was just interesting that one of the feedbacks we got is that if you raise too small of a round, people don't even want to bother because it's not enough investment for them to justify their own time. So, in a way, like, raising a higher round enables kind of bigger fish to play, and they get more interested. So that was pretty interesting. And then the last sort of element was actually selling to Amber data. So after raising our second round, we hired some more people. As a founder, I thought one of the hardest things was scaling a team, so we were actually able to hire a couple of really good hires. That I'm super happy.
00:23:07.256 - 00:23:54.374, Speaker A: Like, our team was really. I mean, they still are. They're still working at Amber data, but our team was really good, but it was hard to expand beyond that. It's really hard to find good talent, and once you find that talent, like, can they get up to speed quick enough to do the things that you need them to do? And so we actually ended up pursuing the m and a path because we found that this would be the best way to scale. The thing about crypto is that things move so fast that if you're not moving forward, you're dying. I felt like we had a really good head start and a good grip in the market, and if I didn't sort of keep up, I just feel it in my gut, like, we're going to lose everything because others will be able to pass us, and then we'll become irrelevant, and then we won't matter. So we need to scale extremely fast.
00:23:54.374 - 00:24:33.072, Speaker A: And that was sort of my biggest concern as a CEO. Like, how do I scale and make sure we keep our market share? I want to grow our market share, but I definitely don't want to lose any market share. And so m and a seemed like the cleanest way to do that. And so we met the founders of Amber data. There was a really good cultural fit there, and they're a bigger organization, and so they were able to help us scale our efforts. And now we're sort of, now I lead the derivatives data aspect of Amber data, which is a data conglomerate for crypto. So they do on chain data, they do spot data, and now they do basically derivatives data through us.
00:24:33.072 - 00:24:35.940, Speaker A: And so that made the most sense. It was the best fit.
00:24:36.480 - 00:25:23.610, Speaker B: Interesting, fascinating story. I think one thing that you mentioned there was almost like pushing a boulder uphill initially, and then once you get a certain amount of momentum, it reverses course and things become much easier, especially when bitcoins above 50. But on the advisor side and, like, scaling talent, what were, I mean, obviously you were talking about, like, acquiring talent and that being rather difficult. But on the advisor side, was there any, like, particular, like, words of wisdom that you have to founders or builders that are looking to either find help or advisors or, like, go and scale teams to the level that they need to?
00:25:25.150 - 00:25:54.848, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good question. So for me, sort of the two advisors, Tony Stewart and Ewan Sinclair, who came on at sort of the tail end before our second round, these are people that I had, like, read. I had read a lot of Ewan Sinclair's books. We have another advisor, Mark Shapashi, who was with us since day one. So I want to acknowledge him, too. He was really good. But Tony and Yuan, we basically came on later.
00:25:54.848 - 00:26:14.352, Speaker A: And so I was already a big fan of Yuan. I had read all his books. I knew all his works. I knew him very well. And so that was just kind of a little bit of fate. We hired Jalen, who basically ran our operations at GVaL in a lot of our marketing. So he would do a lot of outbound, reaching out to people and saying, check out our platform.
00:26:14.352 - 00:26:28.986, Speaker A: I see you're on options. What do you think about this? And so he actually reached out to Yuan by coincidence. And Yuan was really receptive. He wanted to check out our platform. And then I talked to my co founder. I was like, we got to make this guy an advisor. And so my co founder was cool with that.
00:26:28.986 - 00:27:07.712, Speaker A: So I ended up jumping on the call with him and explained to him what we were doing. And he said, really interested and excited. So that kind of just maybe fell in my lap a little bit. And then with Tony Stewart, it was very similar as well. He actually had reached out to us to see kind of, it was kind of a long story, but there was a competitor out there who also wanted Tony, and Tony actually reached out to us and we were able to snag him. And so that was something I was really cool, and I was really happy to have him on board. I think one of the things for advisors is that having an advisor that's very engaged is super useful.
00:27:07.712 - 00:27:30.960, Speaker A: You can get advisors that are kind of like on the cap table, but they don't really do anything. Then you have other advisors who you talk to every day. And so those two are guys I essentially talk to every day, super engaged and provide a lot of value. And so I would say that's something to keep in mind when you're looking for advisors. How engaged are they going to be? Because at the end of the day, you're the one building the company.
00:27:31.580 - 00:28:28.290, Speaker B: Definitely. And I always kind of echo that sentiment to founders that I talked to, as well as making sure that, I mean, both of your incentives are aligned and that on, like, the advisory side, that they're working for you. And like you said, just like, not getting people at the end of the day on the cap table just for, like, kind of naming purposes. But no, it's amazing to hear your perspective and kind of how helpful that they were throughout the process. It's fascinating. Ultimately, you got acquired, which is no small feat in itself. Could you talk a little bit about, you were primarily saying this was to help scale and continue the company to grow, but could you talk a little bit about the process of selling your company and some of the thought that went into that?
00:28:28.930 - 00:28:48.070, Speaker A: Yeah, happy to. That was probably one of the most stressful aspects ever. So one of the things, so when you're selling your company, I mean, I learned this all on the fly. I had never done this before. So they want to look at all your books and all that stuff. So you want to make sure that your paperwork is super well organized. We were pretty good.
00:28:48.070 - 00:29:22.672, Speaker A: We definitely were intentional about organizing our paperwork from the start, but it wasn't good enough. And so it's one of those things, like, as a new founder, I would highly recommend, like, keep your paperwork in order from day one, because otherwise it's just like, it's just such a pain. One of the things to keep in mind is when you're selling, you're still running the company. And so anyone who's a founder knows that they literally have no time to start with. And so now if you're selling and gathering paperwork at the same time, it's like you have no time squared. So that becomes, like, very stressful. And, I mean, you can easily get high strung.
00:29:22.672 - 00:30:04.532, Speaker A: I was definitely pretty high strung for a while during that process. And it's one of those things that, like, you can't slack on any basic component. One of the other big stressors is that you get a letter of intention and Loi, those are basically an outline of the terms. And so you start the due diligence process. And the due diligence process is like, basically, when you start paying lawyers, just because you're in due diligence doesn't mean this deal will go through. And so even from the selling side, your lawyers are going to be expensive. So you're kind of, you know, you're taking a shot, but if it doesn't work out, like, you're out a lot of money and you're out a lot of time.
00:30:04.676 - 00:30:09.800, Speaker B: So I always say crypto lawyers are the only winners in bull markets and bear markets.
00:30:11.180 - 00:30:33.020, Speaker A: I love it. Yeah. So they're definitely, it's definitely a lot of work. Another one is that you're kind of managing two legal teams, and so the buying lawyers want all these things. Your lawyer wants all these things. And everyone's timeline is super compressed and rush, and if someone's late a day to respond, like, everyone's yelling at each other. So there's a lot of that.
00:30:33.020 - 00:31:17.432, Speaker A: So that's kind of another thing you want to keep in mind to manage. And it's a really big roller coaster ride because you're thinking, okay, what do I do if this doesn't go through? Like, how do we survive as a company? How does my team, I don't want my team to be demoralized, because now they're thinking, we're getting inquired and not getting inquired, stuff like that. And then you have a lot of people's interests that you're balancing. So you have all your investors who got into your company at different points. So my round one investors, they're happy. My round two investors, well, we, we raise in the bull market and we're selling in the bear market. And so there's kind of that to balance with those expectations, to balance with them.
00:31:17.432 - 00:31:52.132, Speaker A: And then you have all your employees, like, you want to make sure to do right by them, and then you also have to make sure that the deal is fair for you and for the buyer. It's like, don't. I mean, this is, I have a sample size of one, but my thinking was, don't go in thinking like, oh, I'm getting bought out. Like, I won the lottery. Like, you're not going to get everything you want when you're getting inquired, and the buyer is not going to get everything they want when they're buying you. It's like, you're looking to get a fair deal where it's fair for both sides. Otherwise, if they overpay for you, it's going to be a nightmare.
00:31:52.132 - 00:32:06.850, Speaker A: When you're working for them, they're going to be feeling buyers remorse and if you undersell yourself, you're going to be feeling sellers remorse. There's a lot of interests to balance and it's really like a tight needle thread.
00:32:07.670 - 00:32:46.780, Speaker B: Yeah, it is interesting, and I'm sure you learned quite a bit going through that process. The whole founder's journey is quite unique. There's a lot of things that you just simply didn't know in the beginning. And as you kind of progress, like you just pick up all these random skills, it is hard, especially on the legal side. There's a lot of hoops to jump through. But no, definitely appreciate you sharing on maybe shifting slightly. You recently put out the volatility report and some of the high level thoughts there.
00:32:46.780 - 00:32:49.880, Speaker B: Could you share them here?
00:32:50.820 - 00:33:25.762, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So kind of high level. Basically what we wanted to do is we wanted to look at our data lake and analyze four years of bitcoin volatility data and see if we can sort of determine volatility regimes. So when you're looking at the volatility surface, there's a lot of different components to it. There's sort of the wings and the spine. So the spine is really the term structure meaning add the money volatility for each different expiration and then the wings are out of the money options for calls versus out of money options for points in equities and commodities. These relationships are pretty well defined.
00:33:25.762 - 00:34:16.691, Speaker A: They've been around forever, but that wasn't always the case. So I don't know if you've heard of the 1987 crash. I'm sure you have, and maybe for your listeners in 1987 we had a huge stock market crash that dropped like 20% in one day on some random Monday. And so before that, the way that people priced implied volatility on the indexes was that they would have flat implied volatility, meaning at the money, implied volatility was 13 and out of money options were also 13. And so when that 1987 crash happened, people realized that those models were wrong, because if the market actually gets to those out of the money options, it by definition requires more volatility to get there. And so the volatility environment will be different by definition. And so that actually should, instead of being priced at 13, should be maybe priced higher at probably 22.
00:34:16.691 - 00:35:07.206, Speaker A: Now you have implied volatility skew what we're trying to do in the bitcoin space is we're trying to quantify, have these relationships being determined. Does the bitcoin volatility surface have some sort of predetermined shape to it that essentially it trades around? My opinion and my conclusion is that, no, it's not defined yet. And we've seen times where bitcoin calls are more expensive than puts out of money, calls are cheaper than at the money. Those relationships are completely inverse. And then we look at the term structure as well, options that expired three days versus three months versus nine months. What do those relationships look like? And so we spent a lot of time quantifying that. So those are really sort of interesting high level aspects.
00:35:07.206 - 00:35:11.872, Speaker A: And then we ran a couple back tests to find some profitable strategies on.
00:35:12.056 - 00:35:31.020, Speaker B: Kind of having the space be more defined in terms of volatility. What do you think it will take for the market to get there? Just larger players in the space, better markets like dervit to trade on? I'm curious, like, what needs to happen?
00:35:32.240 - 00:36:07.814, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point. So I definitely think more participants increases efficiency. You just have more people thinking about things. You have more capital sloshing around things like that. So that's definitely part of it. I think another part is just time, because essentially, since bitcoins and crypto is such a new asset class, who's to say what it's really worth? And then who's to say the path it takes as it finds its true value? And so the path would be the volatility, the value would be sort of like the price. All these are big questions have yet to be determined.
00:36:07.814 - 00:36:42.774, Speaker A: And then lastly, it's like bitcoin at $30 is going to behave a lot differently than bitcoin at $30,000. The market caps are different. The players themselves are different. The venues to trade on are different, things like that. A lot of these things are part of a maturing market. And so it's really interesting to see or try to determine the path of the asset price. I really think that a lot of it is going to be just time, but new market participants and more market participants will help as well.
00:36:42.942 - 00:37:09.300, Speaker B: Preston, when you were growing the company and pulling analytics, scaling, what were the biggest things that you found as a barrier to getting more market participants? Is it overall growing the asset class in terms of size from a trillion to 5 trillion, 10 trillion? Is it making better applications on chain? What are the hesitancies for new participants to join?
00:37:10.080 - 00:37:40.456, Speaker A: Adam in the crypto volume space? The big one in my opinion is that the US market is essentially still locked out. We have CME futures and future options and we just got the veto, which is that bitcoin ETF that launched last year. So those are big moves forward. But at the end of the day, the main market is dare bit. The US can't trade on dare bit. And so that shuts out a lot of participants. The world's biggest options market is in the US.
00:37:40.456 - 00:38:33.170, Speaker A: And so it makes sense that once that bridge can be, once that gap can be bridged, we'll see more adoption. But just to give you an idea of the size of the markets, if I look at bitcoin market cap versus the notional option open interest, it's about 6% on the market cap. If I look at stocks like for spy, for example, the S and P 500 ETF, the notional open interest is 200% the market cap. So there's a huge difference in the relationship between the options market and the underlying market. Then the market cap of bitcoin itself is very small. So I could see the bitcoin market cap ten x, and then I could see notional options open interest 30 x. And so that's a huge differential today from where it could be in the future.
00:38:34.750 - 00:39:26.490, Speaker B: That's great context. I mean, crazy how small relative to traditional markets that crypto actually is. I mean, one of the reasons why I'm so excited about the space and it continuing to grow. I mean, there's many metrics like that. I think even looking at the more popular applications like Uniswap or Opensea, there's less than 5 million people that have interacted with those applications individually. And so I don't know, there's a lot of things to look forward to just on the growth standpoint in terms of the company. I mean, you obviously now have been inquired how has, if any, things changed the day to day operations and how, I guess, from the product standpoint, what are you guys now marching forward as? The North Star?
00:39:27.830 - 00:39:54.032, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think from a day to day operations, the integration has been really smooth. So I'm super pleased with that. We've been able to just do business as usual and slowly integrate to match our colors and things like that. Sort of the easy stuff. But the direction has been still very independent. Not totally independent, but I have a lot of input on the direction.
00:39:54.032 - 00:40:48.612, Speaker A: I've been really pleased with the integration. The next thing that we're marching towards, we're always adding new data sources and making new features. That's a forever game. But I think the next big element is going to be some portfolio management tools, especially because of a company like Amber data, which has holistic crypto data. It becomes really interesting to say, okay, I log in with my wallet, I can see all my Lyra option positions, I can see my Darabit option positions, I can see my uniswap LP positions, I can see my whatever other assets on some other Dex positions all in one place. Now I can have a holistic portfolio tool that helps me check out all the metrics so I can see change shifts in spot price, shifts in time, shifts in implied ball shifts in all the greeks and stuff like that. That's really what we're marching towards.
00:40:48.612 - 00:40:54.440, Speaker A: And really, you can only do that holistically from a company like Amber data. So I'm really excited about that.
00:40:55.100 - 00:41:00.000, Speaker B: I guess Amber data makes it a lot easier to integrate with those data sources.
00:41:01.370 - 00:41:39.650, Speaker A: Exactly. And from an investor perspective, like, again, we haven't figured out what crypto should be worth. We haven't determined what the path should be worth. Another unexplored area is how do these data sets interact with each other? Like, how do on chain flows translate to implied volatility? Or how does NFT trading translate to ERC 20 trades and stuff like that? No one yet that I know of. I'm sure people are going to get started soon, but looking at all the data, how it all interacts with each other is undiscovered goldmine. And there's definitely going to be some nuggets there of profitability.
00:41:40.510 - 00:42:09.800, Speaker B: Definitely, definitely. I think the NFT kind of asset class for me personally caught me a little bit off guard and how popular they actually became. But now very excited just for the user onboarding point of view of nfts, is there ever like, any synergies that you think down the line between like, nfts and options market, or are you going to strictly kind of stick to like, the more traditional markets and trading?
00:42:10.860 - 00:42:50.794, Speaker A: So my co founder loves nfts. Like, he's all over that and he's definitely done pretty good trading nfts. So I definitely think there's a lot to explore there. To me, the relationships that are very interesting would be what is the correlation between nfts and bitcoin prices? What is the beta of nfts to bitcoin prices? And then can I trade bitcoin options versus an NFT? Basically, I buy a couple punks and then I sell bitcoin options to finance those. And then if the market rallies, I'll lose all my options. But my punk should outperform if the market goes down, you know, whatever it is. And so I think those are really.
00:42:50.842 - 00:43:07.230, Speaker B: Interesting relationships that would be, yeah, very interesting. Fascinating. And then, so are you, like, with Genesis volatility, primarily focus on pulling, like, data sources from Ethereum, or are you kind of chained agnostic?
00:43:08.810 - 00:43:39.820, Speaker A: Yeah, for us, it's mostly been c five. We're chain agnostic, so we're more protocol specific for the Defi ones. And so optimism and arbitrum for Lyra and in mainnet for squeef or open sweep. And then premium is on a bunch of different chains as well, so we cover that. And in ribbon, we cover that as well. So we're definitely, like, EVM focused for sure. But, yeah, I would say definitely EVM for sure.
00:43:40.160 - 00:43:46.820, Speaker B: Any interest in looking outside of the EVM world, or is that going to be the sandbox that the team plays in?
00:43:48.040 - 00:44:04.136, Speaker A: I think Amber data has that interest me personally, not really. I think I'll stay at EVM forever, but I'm not really the on chain guy. That's really my co founder. But speaking for him, he's EVM forever as well. So it comes out to be the same.
00:44:04.328 - 00:44:40.060, Speaker B: Nice, nice. Very interesting. And then maybe shifting the conversation a little bit again, obviously, in 2021, there is a lot happening just with the feds and printing. And then 2022, kind of things have definitely changed. And then now going into 2023, kind of like people overall, like, we're resetting and trying to figure out where we're at. I'd be curious on your point of view and, like, how you've seen things evolve and where we're at now today on, like, the macro perspective.
00:44:41.270 - 00:45:53.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I've kind of been sticking to my guns on this, and it's not the popular opinion, but I think, like, I think we're at a really interesting inflection point. So we're going from, like, globalization to de globalization with, like, to a political risk that I know nothing about. We're also going from, like, a low or easy money monetary policy to not easy money monetary policy, which is interesting. We're at a sort of tail end of a 30 year bond market rally, which, how does that impact everything? And then the western world is incredibly indebted. Like, how do we handle sustainable inflation if that does occur? And so that's kind of another big question mark to me. The way that crypto is behaving seems very counterintuitive to what other risk assets are doing. We're seeing higher bond yields, we're seeing gold drop a lot in value if you make the argument that bitcoin is digital gold, while bitcoin is doing its own thing.
00:45:53.700 - 00:46:23.604, Speaker A: But maybe bitcoin is acting more like the Nasdaq, maybe that's the case. Well, you know, tech stocks, those are a little bit of a question mark right now, depending on what rates do. And then commodities have come off a lot, but maybe they'll come back up if there's geopolitical tensions mounting again. It just seems like very unsure. I just don't have a lot of confidence personally on my analysis. On analysis. On my analysis right now, I just think I just.
00:46:23.604 - 00:46:39.820, Speaker A: A lot of big question marks, and if anything, I'm more on the cautious side. And I think higher rates probably bond markets. The bond market is the market. I think that's probably the most efficient market and the one that has the most participants in it. We think through these things.
00:46:40.880 - 00:47:12.930, Speaker B: So in terms of relating it back to crypto, how do you see, with all that being said, playing out in 2023? Do you think it's kind of mirrors the 20 18 20 19 20 20 cycle where we just have sideways for a while in terms of markets more broadly? Do you think just with how infrastructure has progressed on the crypto side that we still get user adoption? I'm curious.
00:47:13.750 - 00:48:00.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for crypto prices, if we're going to a restrictive monetary policy environment, crypto has never been in that environment. And so to me, the way that I'm thinking about it is if prices go down, like, I'm interested in bitcoin 10,000, that's a bi level that interests me. If we don't get to that level, then I'm buying on the higher side. I'll buy when there's more certainty, and there's never perfect certainty. But when a lot of these questions have been answered, inflation has clearly shown that was transitory, and now it's gone. And bitcoin is $40,000, and I'll look to try to get long on the upside at that point. So this middle range, I'm sort of like.
00:48:00.030 - 00:48:04.270, Speaker A: I'm just still kind of. It could go either way.
00:48:04.430 - 00:48:21.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I know your day to day is really in the nuts and bolts of, like, trading and options and the volatility markets, but are there any other specifically, like, products that you follow closely that are on chain outside of those, like, immediate purview?
00:48:22.660 - 00:48:46.420, Speaker A: Yeah. Lyra is the only one right now. It's the only crypto that I own. And to me, it's a product that makes a lot of sense. To me it solves like the market making pain point for an on chain options protocol. And at the same time it has just as good of like a user experience from the taker side. So to me that solves the two pain points.
00:48:46.420 - 00:48:52.932, Speaker A: So I think that's a really interesting one and that's really where my focus has been on the on chain side.
00:48:53.116 - 00:49:09.360, Speaker B: Interesting. Very cool. And then maybe jumping back a little bit, you said, like, you have very strong conviction around, like, Ethereum and like, ethereum's kind of roadmap. Could you share a little bit more about like, what ultimately led you to build such strong conviction?
00:49:10.620 - 00:49:46.862, Speaker A: Yeah. So one of the things like Ethereum is a base layer. So like every, a lot of projects are built on top of Ethereum. A lot of the other tokens are built on top of Ethereum infrastructure. Like all this, not all the stablecoins, but essentially all the ones that matter are like within the Ethereum ecosystem, all the interesting L2s are built on the EVM. And so to me it's one of those things where the dev developer environment seems to be centered around Ethereum and is resilient on Ethereum. And so to me, that's the winning ticket.
00:49:46.862 - 00:50:11.150, Speaker A: Ultimately, wherever people build is where I think the real value will accrue. A lot of the NFTs that was built on Ethereum, the ICO craze was built on Ethereum. The Defi innovation was built on Ethereum. Everything is essentially built on Ethereum. To me, it's crazy that Ethereum is not the number one market cap, but I felt like gas in 2016, so we'll see.
00:50:12.970 - 00:50:27.630, Speaker B: I am surprised the smart contract platform is not supplanted bitcoin as number one so far. It does seem obvious in the long term that a smart contract platform will be more valuable than bitcoin alone.
00:50:28.780 - 00:50:31.080, Speaker A: That's how I feel too. Yeah, for sure.
00:50:31.580 - 00:50:50.560, Speaker B: And then I guess so. I always ask this question recently and it's been a little bit more spicy, what would make you kind of like change your mind on like the Ethereum ecosystem or kind of pause your conviction and that maybe what you initially thought is not totally playing out?
00:50:52.140 - 00:51:24.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I would, I would say this is actually true today. And this is where I give points to Fabio on the Amber data team as well. The other options guy, I think the direction of the values of the Ethereum community, for example, I'm not a big Davos crowd guy. If we're going that direction, I don't like that. I don't want more government. I want less government. To me, the bitcoin values are a lot more congruent to that.
00:51:24.740 - 00:51:54.900, Speaker A: And I think that's what's kind of interesting from bitcoin's perspective. And so I don't know if like, that's kind of the one thing that like, trips me out. I mean, obviously, like the Ethereum ecosystem is separate from that. You know, whatever Vitalik's convictions are or are not now that I pay super close attention to his. But ultimately he is not ethereum alone. But that would be kind of something that gives me pause. Like, I don't want, I don't know, I don't want government control.
00:51:55.920 - 00:52:08.260, Speaker B: So is it more, just so I understand correctly, is it more like an elitist community or is it more just being able to, with the OFAC censor specific transactions?
00:52:09.200 - 00:52:29.130, Speaker A: Yes, sensor specific. I mean, elitism is not something that I think is cool, but it's a, that's not, that's not what worries me. Like, I'm worried about like censorship or like basically like surveillance or things like that. Things where it's like you don't tow the party government line, then we'll do something to you.
00:52:30.190 - 00:52:37.370, Speaker B: And then on the L2 side, like what's kind of caught your eye and what do you find most interesting there?
00:52:38.990 - 00:53:13.992, Speaker A: Yeah, well, optimism and harvardrum are pretty interesting. Another one that was really cool. And this is not from an investment perspective, but it's just from a use case perspective. Like immutable x is a really interesting sort of. I was a big gods and chain guy and I really liked that game and I was playing it for a long time. And so it's just kind of interesting that sort of that side of the ecosystem as well. And so to me, like digital game assets and stuff like that, whether it's a card game or another type of game, I don't know.
00:53:13.992 - 00:53:21.740, Speaker A: I think there's probably something there. I don't know that it's been a solved puzzle yet, but I do think that's going to be somewhere in the future.
00:53:22.400 - 00:54:02.130, Speaker B: Yeah. On, I guess, the adoption side or gaming side, what do you feel like will be the catalyst to outside of just number go up with price, which always helps. But from actual user adoption, I think looking back to 2017, it was icositive, um, which I guess could be debatable from a product point of view, but served its purpose. And then ultimately, uh, then you got DeFi Summer and like 2020 and then nfTs. Do you have like in point of view or in your point of view. Do you have, like, a particular thing that will be a catalyst, or do you think it's, uh, kind of open ended?
00:54:03.710 - 00:54:23.926, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not sure I would say it's more open ended. It's just one of those things I'm not an expert in. I thought the gods unchained was cool because it was like, Hearthstone was a precedent as far as, like, the adoption of a game. That's very fun. So is magic to gathering. And then from a digital asset perspective, like magic to gathering. Cards are huge collectibles market.
00:54:23.926 - 00:54:36.140, Speaker A: So to me, like, gods unchained could be similar to that. So again, there's like, there's clear precedence that I could use as a model for or that type of game that makes sense.
00:54:37.160 - 00:55:03.180, Speaker B: Maybe. Just as we wrap up, a couple of closing thoughts on the option side, because you're so in the weeds on the day to day of that, are there any specific markets that you think, going back to earlier, you said a lot of them are not effectively priced, but are there any particularly that you think are kind of wacky that people should explore?
00:55:04.280 - 00:55:27.988, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So it's really one of these things in bull markets, there's like an opportunity overload. Overload. And it's like everything seems like it's working. But one of the things that works really well in bull markets is the cash and carry trade, meaning the futures are trading at a huge premium over cash markets. And so you can, you can buy bitcoin, send it to the exchange, sell the future, and essentially get a free spread. That's a really interesting trade.
00:55:27.988 - 00:55:58.334, Speaker A: I've seen it as high as 50% annualized returns with no delta risk. That's pretty cool. Excuse me. So that's pretty cool. Another one is going to be the option skew. So again, in the same vein, when the market is in strong bull market bullish mode, people are just yolo buying calls and they start really overpaying for those calls. And what you can do is you can buy bitcoin, sell a call, use that premium to buy put, and because the calls are so much more expensive than the puts, you basically collar your position.
00:55:58.334 - 00:56:29.130, Speaker A: And so if the market rallies, you make like three times what you're risking. And so that allows you to, like, take up a lot of leverage and, like, measured in like, a responsible way. So that's really interesting. And then in the right now world, I think one of its interesting is that grayscale discount, right? It's like a 50% discount, which is essentially 100% discount. Because if you're buying the asset today and it rallies and closes that gap. It needs to rally 100%. That's an interesting way to get long crypto.
00:56:29.130 - 00:56:37.450, Speaker A: I don't know if that's going to close ever. I don't know the details, just stuff behind the curtain, but that seems interesting to me.
00:56:37.870 - 00:56:56.580, Speaker B: I guess there's a lot of knowledge that you ultimately accumulated to get to this point with options. Are there any good resources that you would point people that are still new to the space on the option market that want to learn more about volatility? Learn about options and how to get involved?
00:56:57.680 - 00:57:18.582, Speaker A: Yeah. So one of my favorite books ever is volatility trading by Ewan Sinclair. That was one of my favorites. That's more advanced. There's kind of an apprentices of that called options trading. That's another good book of his. And then some of my favorite books and training in general is trading in your zone by Mark Douglas, which is sort of the psychology of trading.
00:57:18.582 - 00:57:29.850, Speaker A: And then option pricing and volatility by Natenberg is also a really good book. And then one good trade by Mike Belafoure of SUV Capital is a very good book.
00:57:30.010 - 00:58:23.100, Speaker B: Awesome. I think in general, options are definitely more complex, and so being able to wrap your head around them and fully understand them definitely takes some time and so appreciate having an expert share what he views as good resources. And then maybe lastly, to kind of wrap up the podcast, what are your. I mean, now, I mean, we kind of talked about it a little bit, like how it was a little difficult to raise your first round, but the second round was a little bit more easy. And then ultimately deciding to sell the company and kind of grow internally within this company, what were like just lessons or advice that you would give to founders, kind of as you've had gone through this entire process of starting a company, raising, selling. Any words of wisdom as we kind of wrap it up?
00:58:23.760 - 00:58:53.858, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I think it's hard to see what I did right, but the things that I would change, I did wrong. So one of them would be having your paperwork in order from day one and just be immaculate with it. Immaculate. And two, is like your biggest bottleneck is going to be people. And so having like a process to hire talent or source talent and keep talent, because once, once you do hit those scaling thresholds, you're going to be really happy to have that process down. And that essentially, like people are.
00:58:53.858 - 00:58:59.950, Speaker A: I mean, people is basically the only thing that matters. So I think that process is really important.
00:59:01.050 - 00:59:28.010, Speaker B: Keep your process in place and keep your books clean and orderly, good advice. Perfect. Well, really appreciate you coming on the podcast. Appreciate you sharing your journey, your founders journey, how you kind of started the company, how you ultimately were able to sell the company and continue to grow it, and then all the interesting things on options and volatility. Really appreciate your time and appreciate you coming on.
00:59:28.670 - 00:59:29.990, Speaker A: Absolutely. Thank you so much. Logan.
