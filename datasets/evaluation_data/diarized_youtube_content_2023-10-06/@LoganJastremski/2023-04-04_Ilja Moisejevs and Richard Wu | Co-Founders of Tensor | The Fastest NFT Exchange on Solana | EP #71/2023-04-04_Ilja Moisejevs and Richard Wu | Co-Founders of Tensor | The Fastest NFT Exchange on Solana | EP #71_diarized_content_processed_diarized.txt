00:00:00.120 - 00:00:15.806, Speaker A: When we initially came into the NFT space, there weren't any pro trading products at all, or there were very few, and they weren't, you know, well known. Like, blur didn't exist. That's sort of like, you know, what people compare us most to? And it wasn't until sort of like, they launched on Ethereum and we launched at Solana that people really got into this whole, like, pro NFT trading thing.
00:00:15.838 - 00:00:57.250, Speaker B: I think the volume was really small, and I think that's why most people with their quantitative hat on, kind of discounted it pretty fast. And they said like, hey, this is just a toy. We thought that ultimately, if nfts are going to fulfill their promise at becoming a global thing for the world that everybody touches, it's going to become more similar to other financial assets. And if you take that perspective, then the next logical leap that you make is, well, the trading product needs to be also pretty similar to existing trading products. And like Richard was saying, would be real time, be faster, it'd be analytical, right? It wouldn't be the kind of eBay esque experience that you get from the first generation of marketplaces.
00:01:01.700 - 00:01:38.510, Speaker C: Today, I'm excited to be recording a podcast with the co founders of Tensor. Really have taken the world by storm on the Solana ecosystem, taking quite a few volume from magic, Eden of side of things, and a newcomer in the space focusing on advanced trading of nfts. So on a high level, going to get a little bit more about their backgrounds, jump into some of the deep technical things that they're working on. But I think it'll be a great conversation maybe to start off the podcast. Can each of you just do a quick intro on yourselves and how you got into the industry?
00:01:40.290 - 00:02:10.450, Speaker A: Sure, I guess I could start. So I got in pretty late. In fact, I wasn't really into crypto. I mean, I was dabbling in it in 2017 during the insane bull run of Ethereum and bitcoin. But until, like, recently, when I met Ilmoye, I wasn't deep into crypto at all. So, in fact, before I met him, I was actually doing quant research at a quantitative hedge fund in New York City. And I was there for about two, three years doing alpha research.
00:02:10.450 - 00:02:24.850, Speaker A: And after two, three years, I was thinking to myself, hey, I want to try something more riskier. I want to try something that touches on a consumer product. And that's when I decided to look for a co founder to work on a startup together.
00:02:26.390 - 00:02:26.838, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:26.894 - 00:02:28.450, Speaker A: How that illid you as intro?
00:02:29.310 - 00:03:07.682, Speaker B: Yeah, I had a background also kind of similar to Richard and, like, tech and finance a little bit more on the investment banking side. So I know, like, legend comes from that world, too, so we can riff with that, but basically was like a finance nerd always. She's like, kind of really interested in financial concepts, you know, trading everything. And crypto is like, you know, finance nerds heaven because, like, you get to basically define the rules that have already been written for you in the big boy world. I was hacking a little bit on ethereum before I found Solana, but then discovered Solana pretty quickly. Fell in love with the speed in the UX, kind of total ux maxi here. I think we both are.
00:03:07.682 - 00:03:19.590, Speaker B: And yeah, after that met Richard, we decided to work on trial project at first, which was like an oracle for NFT pricing, and then that evolved into tensor, the trading platform as it is today.
00:03:20.650 - 00:03:49.856, Speaker C: Excellent. Excellent. Now, I think I. Yeah, I would love to ultimately maybe get into a little bit more about your fundraising process. I think you guys have really stepped up the tweet game, which is great. I think, in the ecosystem, part of it is building the core product, which I think you guys are phenomenal at, but the other part is the distribution and getting your name out there. And for better or worse, I feel like Twitter is, unfortunately, the place where all that happens.
00:03:49.856 - 00:04:22.660, Speaker C: And so being able to be able to disseminate information and kind of boil that down into kind of sometimes punchy tweets is difficult. But I think you guys have gotten much better at that recently. And on that front, I mean, maybe before we jump into tensor specifically, could you share more about the fundraising process, how you guys ultimately decided to start building tensor, even talking about some of those perils and FTX, because I think that hit the Solana industry pretty hard as well.
00:04:23.920 - 00:05:10.980, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's funny you mentioned FTX, so I don't know if you know this, but before the whole FTX thing happened, we were actually going after a very similar thesis and almost like, user Persona in that, to give you some context, when we initially came into the NFT space, there weren't any pro trading products at all, or there were very few, and they weren't well known. Blur didn't exist. That's sort of like what people compare us most to. In fact, we actually started building around the time that blurtainden started building, and it wasn't until sort of like, they launched on Ethereum and we launched at Solana that people really got into this whole pro NFT trading thing. But our thesis initially was we wanted to cater to the more prosumer type of NFT trader.
00:05:10.980 - 00:05:57.056, Speaker A: People who come from a finance background, like Ilya, like me, people who want to see a lot of data when they're trading and making decisions on whether to buy or sell an NFT. A big component of that, of course, is real time data. If you've done any trading in the past, you know that having real time data is essential. Whether it's trading coins, whether it's trading stocks, whether it's day trading anything, you need to have real time data to succeed. The second thing is obviously charts, analytics, all of that stuff helps. We were essentially thinking that most of the NFT volume are done by these prosumer traders, people who move like hundreds of nfts at once. Almost like the whales that we see on crypto Twitter.
00:05:57.056 - 00:06:27.080, Speaker A: And we thought we'd build a product exactly for them. Almost like the FTX for nfts, where you get to see the trading view chart. The user experience is heavily oriented around bulk actions. And you can list a bunch of nfts, delist a bunch of nfts in a single UI. And that's exactly what we built initially, I think, leading into the fundraising. Actually, maybe I'll let Omoy talk about our fundraising, because that's a very interesting story.
00:06:28.060 - 00:06:50.880, Speaker C: I mean, maybe just quickly on, like, the product side of things, you and the team, I think not very many people approached nFTs from, like, the pro trading side. Can you talk slightly more about, like, why specifically pro trading? Was it just how much volume you saw these kind of individuals or whales start to move on chain?
00:06:53.940 - 00:07:27.330, Speaker B: There's actually almost the other way around. I think the volume was really small. And I think that's why most people with their quantitative hat on, kind of discounted it pretty fast. And they said like, hey, this is just a toy that is never going to be serious. But the thing that I guess resonated with us is we saw similar behavior to what we saw among traders trading coins. Like similar interests, speculative nature and back and forth. Really, if you ask why are people buying this mainly for speculative purposes? It's less so for collecting.
00:07:27.330 - 00:08:14.080, Speaker B: And we felt that the current meta, which was very much about collecting and putting things into your wallet and never trading it again, would be very short lived. We thought that ultimately, if NFTs are going to fulfill their promise at becoming a global thing for the world that everybody touches, it's going to become more similar to other financial assets. And if you take that perspective, then the next logical lead that you make is, well, the trading product needs to be also pretty similar to existing trading products. And like Richard was saying, would be real time, be faster, it'd be analytical, it wouldn't be the kind of eBay esque experience that you get from the first generation of marketplaces where it's like large pictures, one filter menu. That's it. That's all you can do.
00:08:15.340 - 00:09:25.700, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, and today, the exchanges are really kind of all encompassing, trying to create or tailor their experience also to kind of those collector types that exist today, and then also the pro trading experience, but when trying to focus on both, not really tailoring that experience to any specific one. So I think it's very interesting that you guys have taken this approach, and maybe that it wasn't super obvious, but blur kind of kicked off at least the attention to the pro tradering side of nfts, and you really have captured that momentum and taken it to next level. But I, jumping back to the fundraising side, I think I saw a tweet about how tensor was really underappreciated and just what you guys were trying to do at the time. And I think we talked with you guys early at frictionless, and I personally even had a little bit of hard time understanding it as well. And so maybe talk about some of the, like, early fundraising, the stuff that happened with FTX and where you guys kind of ultimately have sand today.
00:09:27.280 - 00:10:07.190, Speaker A: Yep. So we started fundraising, in fact, the day of, like when FTX, when the whole collapse happened, we actually went through an accelerator called alliance. They're sort of known as, you know, they're basically like the YC of web3. Like, they're super well connected in the industry. They've incubated, like, some of the biggest protocols, you know, like DyDx compound, I think. Or at least they're close with all the founders of these big protocols that she started off in Defi, and we went through one of their latest accelerator cohorts. And so when demo day for that accelerator happened, that was the day that FTS collapsed.
00:10:07.190 - 00:10:44.952, Speaker A: And of course, FTX had a very, had a large association with Solana. Like, SPF, for better or worse, was the biggest factor of Solana at the time. And we were only on salon at the time. And so right after we finished Doubleday, and when we started talking to investors, a lot of them just frankly weren't very interested in us. They were asking us, like, when are you moving to Ethereum? When are you going to build on Polygon? When are you going to build on Ethereum? L1. And at the time, it did kind of influence a lot of our, at least our emotional attitude. Like, we thought that we made the wrong decision going with Solana.
00:10:44.952 - 00:11:56.530, Speaker A: But I think, like, deep down, after some reflection, we knew that we had pretty high conviction that a chain like Solana that can support 400 millisecond transactions, that can support the trading activity that we're seeing before and currently, that is the chain that we want to build our pro trading NFT product on. And we just stuck with our guns. Obviously, Solana has recovered quite a bit and now people are coming back into the ecosystem and we see a lot of sort of like eth Maxis, maybe not eth Maxis, but like people from the Ethereum world looking into Solana now. In fact, after that couple of months post FTX, our lead, which is our lead, ended up being placeholder. Chris Brunisky is the general partner who actually worked on the deal with us. And he originally came from the Ethereum space, but he was thoroughly impressed by the grit and the amount of organic activity that's happening on Solana, that he decided to make a huge bet on us. Him, along with a bunch of our other power users, a bunch of our angels, ended up deciding to invest in our seed round.
00:11:58.350 - 00:11:59.250, Speaker C: Amazing.
00:12:00.070 - 00:12:01.692, Speaker B: I actually want to add to that.
00:12:01.886 - 00:12:02.392, Speaker C: Go for it.
00:12:02.416 - 00:12:34.638, Speaker B: Sorry. Yeah, just very quickly. So I think that last sentence is actually really important. So the first money in was the money of our own customers. Like, we sat there and we basically, we did like 20 vc calls, right? And like Richard said, most of them were like, starting with a question of like, all right, guys, this is cool, but when are you moving somewhere else? Like when? When BNB? When? When Ethereum. And we would just tell them, like, I don't think we're moving, right? And they just laugh us out of the call and that was it. And then obviously you have 20 of those and you start thinking like, hey, maybe this is wrong.
00:12:34.638 - 00:13:01.496, Speaker B: Maybe you're idiots. And then we're like, okay, you know what we're going to do? We're just going to go and we're going to close 500k from our customers. That's it. And if we can do that, we have enough money. We're pretty lean to keep going. And as soon as we went to our customers, they were like, yeah, of course we'll give you money. And like, the first money was in the bank within like a week, you know, and it was just such an eye opening moment for us because surely these guys would not send you money if they thought you were full of shit.
00:13:01.496 - 00:13:28.086, Speaker B: Surely they would not send you money if they thought that the product was not good enough. Whatever. I think once we had that 500k in, it became just a lot easier to breathe. The conversations with VC's stopped to matter because we didn't need the money. It was more like, oh, yeah, it'd be nice to raise more, but who cares? Then we got to a million and at that point we basically thought we were done. And then we met Chris and Chris was like, guys, I'll basically top up and make it a full round. And that's how we ended up, like raising more.
00:13:28.086 - 00:13:37.730, Speaker B: But yeah, just like, I can't overstress. How important for us was those first users and customers that send those wire checks in?
00:13:38.230 - 00:14:29.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, ultimately, if your users are willing to kind of write you a check, as you mentioned, I think that's probably the highest vote of confidence out of anybody. Is your users really saying, I love this product and I love you guys so much that you'll back you with $3? There's really nothing more powerful than that. And I think, I mean, personally, I mean, obviously legend and I are very much a fan of Solana. And I don't know, we'll probably get into some of the more technical nuances later, but I think those early conversations of talking with other VC's and them trying to convince you of building on Ethereum or even Polygon or BNB will be very funny stories and hopefully the future. So.
00:14:31.570 - 00:15:16.208, Speaker A: I guess definitely to add onto that, like, we're not chain maxis, we're not just only going to build on Solana for the next 1020 years. I think, frankly, what's interesting about Solana right now is that it's probably the best chain for what we're doing. But let's say if Polygon gets to sub 1 second transactions and there's a bunch of like, organic NFt activity there, then, I mean, it's, we go where sort of our users go, right? Like our first and foremost priority are our users and traders. It's not. I mean, we love Solana. Like, we're almost like, like 99.9% committed to Solana, but we're not going to just ignore the other chains, of course, 100%.
00:15:16.264 - 00:15:54.138, Speaker C: And I think that is the correct approach. I think my opinion as of today is that the industry really hasn't reached remote scale, even if you look at doing analytics. Opensea, for example, has less than, I think, five or 6 million lifetime active addresses. That's not very many users. I think they've done tremendous volume. I know, that's ultimately what you guys are particularly focused on is lots of volume and the pro trading consumer. I think ultimately the combination of very high volume combined with high users is probably the holy Grail.
00:15:54.138 - 00:16:28.020, Speaker C: And so at least today, there's not very many chains that can do that. Over time, different technology solutions are coming about, and of course, the builder should prioritize where the users are. And that is the end goal. Maybe touching upon Solana a little bit more specifically, each of you, I think, said that you wrote solidity in the beginning and on the EVM, maybe compare and contrast. Like, why did you build on, ultimately choose Solana versus building on Ethereum or like an Ethereum? L. Two.
00:16:29.680 - 00:17:00.814, Speaker B: Yeah. For me, it was basically the UX difference. The problem with Ethereum is that no matter how good of an engineer you are, you're always going to be handicapped by the slow transaction speed of, and by all the problems with mempool and transactions being canceled. This and that. That means that the user doesn't give a shit about what chain they're using. They want a fast product, and now they show up to a product, they click a button, and they wait 30 seconds. Give me an example from the web two world where that is normal and users accept that.
00:17:00.814 - 00:17:25.500, Speaker B: I mean, maybe your legacy bank. In that case, you probably wait for 24 hours, but except for that, and hopefully we don't want to replicate that. I can't think of an example where that's normal. For me, that was the first moment where it's like, all right, I like crypto, but this kind of sucks. The second bubble for me was actually solidity itself. So solidity is more object oriented, while solidity is more functional programming. You pass in accounts, things happen, and then you get accounts out.
00:17:25.500 - 00:17:55.990, Speaker B: And I find the latter model just a lot cleaner to think about and work with. And for whatever it's worth, there have been a lot fewer hacks on Solana compared to Ethereum, precisely because I think it's just more easy. It's easier to reason about. Like, solidity code is pretty difficult on the eye. Solana code, once you know rust and maybe a little bit of anchor, is actually very easy to read. Like, once you've done it once, like, all the contracts, just like, really, really simple to read and handle. So I think for me, like, those two reasons were why I chose Solana.
00:17:57.810 - 00:17:59.146, Speaker C: And maybe, yeah, I mean, I guess.
00:17:59.178 - 00:18:56.910, Speaker A: Maybe giving a perspective from someone who was entirely sort of new to the whole Dapp experience until most recently. I'll give you, like, a very stark example, back when I sort of joined crypto more seriously, in, I guess, beginning of 2022, I was basically trying to experiment with doing stuff on Ethereum, trying to doing stuff on Solana, and I would maybe buy an NFT or two on OpenSea, buy an NFT or two on Magic Eden or other Solana marketplaces. The biggest thing that was very confusing to me was when I made a transaction on OpenSeA, and this was during the time when gas fees were insane. They were like $50 per NFT transaction. I would be sitting there looking at Etherscan and looking at my transaction pending for ten minutes. I'm not even joking. I would be sitting there waiting for ten minutes.
00:18:56.910 - 00:19:34.708, Speaker A: After a certain point, I was like, eh, maybe I don't want this NFT. I want to cancel my transaction. Like, I had no idea. As a dev, like someone who was technical, I had no idea how to do that. When I came to Solana, everything either happened or it failed. And you can, it automatically cancels after like a minute. And to anyone who's not technical, or even someone who's maybe like, technical, but like, doesn't know too much about crypto, like that user experience will make or break someone's decision on whether or not to use Ethereum versus Solana 100%.
00:19:34.764 - 00:20:49.994, Speaker C: I mean, personally, I mean, I've had multiple transactions stuck in the mempool of Ethereum because I did not set my gas fees too high and also paid $1,000 plus for uniswap transaction during Defi summer. And I think those two things were the large catalyst for me to kind of look elsewhere. But I think to your point on, ultimately, you can't abstract some of the technical designs of these different architectures and latency really being the key point. By having high latency, it really just extremely, it makes the entire user experience much, much harder. And from that point, any chain that can minimize latency have high throughput, I think is going to kind of have the winning combination, whether that's Solana or something else. So it's great to see that you two are really focused on the user, because I think taking a step back, that's really what's been the thing that's been missing in web3. People are building for only people that want to kind of the crypto natives, which I don't think is bad cohort.
00:20:49.994 - 00:21:33.410, Speaker C: But really, to hit mass adoption, we need to build for the normal person that knows and loves the web two experience. So maybe talking a little bit more on tensor, how have you guys really built it from the ground up for speed. I hear often in your tweets how the limiting factor are you trying to push up to whether that's like, the Solana throughput or you have to refresh the front end because it's too slow. Can you talk about some of these physical limitations that you've been running into while building tensor?
00:21:35.270 - 00:22:26.500, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the architecture we have is pretty standard streaming data architecture, where we just data from a number of sources, including geyser and RPC providers for redundancy, and then put it through like a pretty standard kafka setup, and that ends up in a pretty standard database like nothing fancy. And then I think what happens next is in front of the database. We have like a massive redis cluster, and that serves a lot of the data through the API to the front end. Not always, but most of it, the real magic, I think none of these parts in isolation are neither hard nor going to make or break your product. I think the real magic of tensor actually comes from us just being, like, obsessive over every detail when it comes to speed. And just like, being like, no, this is not good enough. How do we make it faster? No, this is like, too slow.
00:22:26.500 - 00:22:49.100, Speaker B: No, this is too. We need to make it better. Better. Like, you do that 75 times in a row and you end up with something that's just like 50 times better than the next product. And for us, speed is like a first class citizen, and we're thinking about it from day one. And a lot of the work that we do maybe isn't very glamorous. Richard just spent a week optimizing the front end.
00:22:49.100 - 00:23:06.180, Speaker B: That means that you have to sit there and look at a lot of pretty boring charts and just rebuild a lot of the code that exists. You're not shipping new features. It's not as exciting. But then you look at the product after that and it's, holy shit, it's so much faster. That gets us going, that gets us excited. I think our users like that a lot of.
00:23:06.870 - 00:24:35.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess to add on to that, like, it's really about, like, obsessive, like, obsessive compulsion over your customers. If your customers are complaining that the UI is lagging when the, you know, when a new collection is minting and there are, you know, tens and hundreds of transactions coming in on the screen every 100 seconds, and, you know, their computer maybe is not as powerful machine, and our frontend is a bit too slow, it's a bit less optimized. Then we're going to spend a week, two weeks, three weeks trying to dig into react performance tuning and actually looking at flame charts and traces to figure out where is the lag coming from our front end so that we can optimize it, reduce some of the frame drops in order to handle the speed of Solana transactions. No other chain right now, at least for nfTs, no other chain right now has the amount of trading and the number of transactions coming in for NFT trading besides Solana. Ethereum L1, it takes everywhat, like 1017 seconds. You don't need to optimize your front end to handle the real timeness of NFT trading there. But if you're looking at Solana, things are coming in every 400 milliseconds, and if your front end can't process and render all of that at a fraction of that 400 millisecond sort of slot, then it's going to drop frames and your users are going to have a really bad experience.
00:24:35.680 - 00:24:52.000, Speaker A: I think it goes back to building on not the correct infrastructure, but building on infrastructure that requires you to really focus on optimization, whether it's on the front end or the back end.
00:24:52.910 - 00:25:15.010, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great point. I mean, the whole different kind of engineering challenges when everything is sped up by multiple factors of ten. The Ethereum blocks are every 12 seconds, and big difference from Solana's 400 millisecond blocks.
00:25:15.390 - 00:25:41.390, Speaker B: That's actually why every time somebody tells us like, oh, guys, are you worried about this marketplace from Ethereum, like expanding to Solana and taking over your market share? We like secretly giggle because we just know how much fucking work it is to build the kind of product we have on Solana, where we thought about every bite and bid and every part of the pipeline, and it's just like, yeah, they're going to come and they're going to spend a year doing that, and by that time we'll have ten x more market share.
00:25:44.090 - 00:26:23.270, Speaker C: It's definitely a beast in its own, I mean, different virtual machines, as you mentioned, different block times, much different engineering challenges, as you've highlighted from that point of view. I mean, I think in the Ethereum ecosystem, it does kind of, as it stands today at least kind of the more dominant ecosystem in terms of like large volumes, not necessarily like number of transactions. But how has kind of blur and kind of the pro trading meta affected you guys and people kind of using your product with tensor?
00:26:26.070 - 00:27:14.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess to touch on the blur point, I think blur, I think like credit word credit is due. I think Blur really brought to attention the pro trading aspect of nfts to most of crypto. Like, whether we like it or not, Ethereum does have the lion's share of attention right now across all of crypto. And if a big player like Blur does really well, you know, takes away 70% of NFT trading activity on Ethereum, then that really helps us almost sell our thesis that pro trading for nfts is a thing. It's not just something we made up in our heads. We see the number of users on our platform that are using tensor because they need that real time data. They need those pro features like bulk actions.
00:27:14.430 - 00:27:56.830, Speaker A: There isn't a lot, but I think for us, pro trading is going to unlock a lot of things that can't be done with nfts right now. I think, one, it's going to make NFT trading more capital efficient. So no longer do you need to, for example, just leave your NFT listed and hope for someone to hope for someone to come take it. You cannot, for example, immediately sell it into a bid. Or perhaps you can even place bids up on the order book, or I guess the order book. It's not a true order book on tensor yet, but unlocking both the bid side and ask side lets people like yet. Yeah, spoiler alert.
00:27:56.830 - 00:28:27.230, Speaker A: Yeah. Unlocking both the bid side and ask side, you start to see a more a market that resembles more of basically any financial instrument that's ever traded in the past. And it gives better prices to users as well as traders. So if you really want to get out of an NFT collection, like now, you see a ton of bids on the book that you can sell into without having to, essentially having to list your NFT lower and lower until someone decides to come and buy it.
00:28:29.170 - 00:28:45.550, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense. I mean, the order book side of things. If you could snap your fingers or realize the vision of tensor, what is that? And say, what are you trying to create for the final product?
00:28:47.180 - 00:29:24.484, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it would be probably an on chain order book for unique items. That's what nfts are. Nfts are fascinating to us because they inherit many of the properties of fungible tokens, but they add so much new to the mix and you really need to think about both sides in order to build a successful trading product. For example, on tensor right now, you can basically zoom out and you can see nfts at a glance. We can also zoom in and click into each individual NFT and see the details. That's really, really important because different traders trade different ways. Some people focus more on traits, focus more on rarities.
00:29:24.484 - 00:29:49.446, Speaker B: Other people, like Gaius, for example, don't care about any of that. They just sweep the floor. They zoom out completely, they hide the pictures. And successful products need to cater to all the different trader types. I think Solana is really cool because you can build an on chain order book that operates at the speed of light. You can't do that on any other chain right now. Some chains claim you will be able to do that in the future, but they've definitely not been nearly as battle tested as Solana.
00:29:49.446 - 00:29:58.330, Speaker B: And so for us, I think the ultimate vision of tensor is probably going to be an on chain order book for these things. We just need to figure out how to build it.
00:29:59.630 - 00:31:01.838, Speaker A: Yeah, to add more color onto that. The reason why we're not just saying we want to build an order book because it's cool for NFT. Like, there are like business reasons that we will want to do this. Like, you know, after eating glass with building tensor for eleven months now, one of the biggest pain points of trading nfts on Solana nowadays is during when a new collection mints. It's very difficult to, like, sweep nfts because how, you know, how marketplaces and how our platform currently works is that in order to buy a bunch of nfts from a collection, you have to individually select which nfts you want on the front end, and you have to send those transactions to the blockchain and hope that they go through before someone else buys them. So the concurrency aspect of multiple people sending transactions for the same nfts, at most one person is going to end up buying that NFT. And if you're the other 99 individuals who are trying to buy that exact same NFT at the exact same time, everyone's transaction is going to fail.
00:31:01.838 - 00:31:24.370, Speaker A: But if you move everything to an on chain matching engine and sort of like, treat at least, you know, within an NFT collection that all of these NFTs are basically the same. And I don't really care which specific NFT I get. I just want to buy like ten nfts from this collection up to a certain slippage percentage. Like, we can do all of that on chain and have fewer failed transactions and have a better experience for traders.
00:31:25.550 - 00:31:42.140, Speaker C: Going back to some of the technical aspects, what is, I guess, Orlando, whether it's technical or non technical, what are the limiting, limiting factors to actually creating that online central limit order book for these digital items?
00:31:43.800 - 00:32:53.914, Speaker B: The most difficult part is that they are, at the end of the day, unique. If you think about how serum works or other equivalents on Solana, what they basically have is they have two buckets, the ask bucket and the bit bucket. And people either put stuff into the ask bucket or the bid bucket, and they have a crank that lives off chain and that connects those two buckets, and stuff moves from one to the other and then you can withdraw it. That's the matching engine, and it's a beautiful architecture, and Armani is a total goat for building it. But obviously with nfts, the problem now that you have is how do you fit things into two buckets? Because where does the bucket start and stop? And basically, we think that for the current meta of nfts, as they are today, it's kind of like, it's pretty much an unsolvable problem because the collection definition is too vague for you to be able to do that cleanly. On the other hand, we know that there's new things coming up on Solana, including compressed nfts. Compressed nfts are very interesting because first of all, it's a clean slate, so we can do collection definition a lot cleaner from the get go, and secondly, it's a lot higher quantity.
00:32:53.914 - 00:33:00.978, Speaker B: And so it starts to look a lot like, a lot more like fungible tokens. And some of the properties of compressed nfts are going to be closer to fungibles.
00:33:01.114 - 00:33:02.586, Speaker A: And so we think that building an.
00:33:02.618 - 00:33:09.190, Speaker C: Order book overview of compressed nfts for those that don't know or don't understand what it is.
00:33:10.370 - 00:33:51.512, Speaker B: Yeah. Put very simply, compressed nfts is a way to mint a billion nfts for $100. That's like everything that the user should care about. The way it's actually implemented is up to the big brain, starting with Tolly and a bunch of guys who wrote the paper, and then there are people from Solana Labs and Metablex who contributed. But basically there's a tree structure, and the root of that tree lives on chain, and all the machinery that handles that tree structure lives off chain. And basically make sure that the RPC provider, or the thing that serves data to the app actually understands. Like, hey, like given this very cryptic, small, tiny piece of data on chain, this is who's the owner of the NFT.
00:33:51.512 - 00:34:15.350, Speaker B: So the RPC becomes like the translation layer, and there's a lot more creativity for the RPC provider themselves in terms of what they can do and what kind of business they can grow into. Because now you also need to choose, like, hey, which trees am I indexing? Which trees am I not indexing? Like, how am I thinking about that? So I think that's high level compressed nfts. And. Yeah, like I was saying, we just think that there's a real shot at building an order book there, which we like at first in crypto.
00:34:15.730 - 00:35:20.772, Speaker A: Yeah, basically, I guess concretely, if you're a Solana dev, so there's a concept of on chain accounts, in this case, most nfts nowadays, the center of nfts nowadays, you have to create, let's say, a metadata account. You have to create a master edition account, and you have to create the token accounts themselves. All of that lives on the, I guess, the Solana state that is kept on every single validator in order to essentially perform these transactions. What compression in Solana does is that actually moves all of this state to the ledger. So instead of keeping it in memory, essentially on all of these validators at every single time, it essentially just only keeps track of the transactions that are happening in the ledger. And it's up to off chain components to essentially replay all these transactions in order to get the state. But then there's this on chain tree, as Ilya mentioned, that actually gives protocols a way to interact with the accumulated data.
00:35:20.772 - 00:35:24.520, Speaker A: It's a stateless accumulator. I guess the technical term is.
00:35:26.300 - 00:36:18.220, Speaker C: I think this is definitely a area that's going to gain a lot more popularity in the years to come, but still kind of in its emphasis today, maybe. So ultimately, I mean, if I were to summarize, the goal is really creating that on chain order book where most of these or some of these items can almost act as fungible, being able to be treated like a, or tradable in a online central limit order book, which, as you said, I think what was very interesting to me is essentially, if you want to sell an NFT that would, instead of waiting or kind of lowering the floor price over and over again, you already have a bid that's there that would be able to sell into.
00:36:18.840 - 00:37:01.760, Speaker A: Yep. I mean, you can do a lot of cool things with on chain order books right now. You can build an on chain oracle once you have that order book set up and everything is on chain and you have all the bids and all the asks in a single state account, on chain Oracle has become a thing without any additional overhead. And now you can build sophisticated derivatives like perps and using the oracle for automated liquidations without having to talk to an off chain data pipeline. I guess like when we were building our NFT pricing oracle, that was the first project that we worked on together. That was our trial project. It was like because of how marketplaces are set up for nfts.
00:37:01.760 - 00:37:15.560, Speaker A: There had to be an off chain data pipeline in order to publish the prices on chain, and that's just, there's too much risk with trusting a provider to publish those prices on chain.
00:37:16.870 - 00:37:53.000, Speaker C: Yeah, it definitely opens up a lot of possibilities. I'm excited to see what you guys build and are able to utilize the order book with maybe jumping back a little bit to some of your power users and ultimately some of those early users that were fanatic enough about the product and about you as a team to invest in you. Could you talk a little bit more about tensor and who you are catering to from the audience standpoint? And ultimately, where do you think more users are going to come from?
00:37:55.100 - 00:38:53.060, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the users that got excited about Tensor really early on, like the first guys, we actually had like a telegram group with like 50 beta testers shout out to those guys for deleting it us early. But I think those guys, they were definitely on the advanced side of things. So I wouldn't necessarily say that they had like a background in finance or they were pro market makers. The market is a bit too small for that right now, or was too small, but they were definitely users that were treating this very seriously and making a living from this. And so for them, those couple extra seconds shaved off here or there, or the extra charge or being able to see the order book at a glance was pretty important. It's funny because you could look at a tensor today and you could say what's actually new about it compared to, I don't know, whatever, pick your favorite marketplace. And the reality is that every little detail for a pro, for somebody who spends 16 hours looking at the screen, adds up.
00:38:53.060 - 00:39:24.952, Speaker B: And they really care. They really care about being able to have that extra button or extra knob or extra this or extra that. So I think the first 50 guys were like that, and even the first thousand people probably. Over time, tensor started to attract more prosumers. So not necessarily somebody who's doing it full time, but just people who want a faster, slicker experience. And that's why today we have like a pro mode which has all the knobs that you could possibly want, and then the light mode that has a lot fewer nodes. Sorry, knobs, but still has the slickness and the speed of the main product.
00:39:24.952 - 00:39:43.570, Speaker B: In fact, it's faster because it has fewer things on it. So I think that's kind of the direction we're going in. But we still think our thesis remains unchanged. We still think that the bulk of the volume in the future is going to be done by some of these more professional traders, and those are our number one priority. Those are the people we catering to.
00:39:45.030 - 00:41:00.130, Speaker C: I don't know if either of you either played World of Warcraft or runescape, but I was definitely in the auction house quite a bit, trading those items, trying to get my early gold back in the day. So I can definitely see kind of painting the future in a couple of years or 510 years, as these digital items become much more robust. This is kind of the standard way to exchange digital items. So very fascinating to see, I guess, how ultimately you have really come on this scene relatively quickly within the past couple months. I feel like crypto, everything is kind of always shifting very fast. But you have been able to gain quite a bit of market share from within the Solana ecosystem, specifically from Magic Eden. Can you talk about, I mean, how you kind of are viewing that? Is it just building the best product possible? And at the end of the day, market share will just kind of accumulate to whatever product people enjoy or how are you thinking about kind of your uprising specifically in the Solana ecosystem?
00:41:01.280 - 00:41:46.212, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it's one thing. I think it's multiple things combined, obviously. First and foremost, we want to build the best product for NFT trading out there. We want to stay close to our customers. We want to talk to every single person that comes through the door, ideally, and try to understand what are their pain points? What do they want improved in their NFT trading experience? I think one thing that we're doing differently compared to, let's say, magic Eden and maybe other marketplaces, like not just magic union, but in general, is that we want to build a platform where if users make us successful because they're coming to tensor, they're trading, they're providing liquidity. We want them to essentially be exposed to our success. So I guess I'll give you a concrete example.
00:41:46.212 - 00:42:40.670, Speaker A: Currently, we have loot boxes in our rewards program going on. So in season one of tensor rewards, we essentially gave these loot boxes to everyone who provided liquidity on tensor or traded on tensor. Since we launched, we also did an airdrop to everyone who traded a lot of nfts on Solana in the past six months. Going forward, we're basically rewarding our users with these loot boxes for providing liquidity on tensor in order to make our markets our protocol. One of the more liquid marketplaces out there for nfts on Solana, and effectively, like, these users are getting these loot boxes, which translates into nfts and other rewards in the future. And you can imagine that these nfts could be correlated with tensors market share in terms of price. That's just one example.
00:42:40.670 - 00:42:49.470, Speaker A: We want to let the community know that you guys are the reason why we're successful, and we want you to be rewarded for that.
00:42:51.620 - 00:43:01.360, Speaker C: Can you share, I mean, a little bit more like on the loot box, and, I mean, kind of giving back to the community in that sense?
00:43:04.700 - 00:43:08.040, Speaker B: Anything in particular that you're thinking there that you want to know?
00:43:09.860 - 00:43:34.520, Speaker C: Like, on a high level? I mean, I think one of the things that makes web3 so kind of unique is giving back to kind of your early community members, being able to share kind of on the upside. And so with this loop box program, I mean, I guess ultimately in its most successful form, how would that look like?
00:43:35.460 - 00:44:59.634, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, so I guess, without going into too much detail, what we can share is that ultimately we want tensor to be owned by the, the users that use it and fully decentralized and controlled through Dao. That's probably as much as we can share right now. The other thing I want to mention is that I know that during the airdrop, we've definitely had people come to us and say, hey, guys, I've been under the threshold and it feels a bit unfair. And I want to put it out there that we really tried going low on the threshold, and we really tried including as many people as possible. We didn't want to discriminate against anybody, because for us, it's important to include every user that has ever touched tensor. But there's just some practical limitations that we just are forced to take into account, because the second you lower the threshold to one sole or zero soul traded and everybody gets a box, what's the price of the box? It's useless because everybody gets one or everybody gets one box, but then the guy that actually matters gets, what, a million boxes at that point, again, what's the point? I don't want anybody to feel bad. And we're really thinking very carefully about how do we design our incentive structures in a way that rewards both the small user that maybe doesn't have a lot of capital, but is spending a lot of time on the product, but also the kind of whale that maybe does have a lot of capital and maybe is a pro.
00:44:59.634 - 00:45:12.510, Speaker B: Right? We have a lot of chats with professional market makers, and how do they get rewarded? So we're really trying to balance it and think about everybody, and we think that nfts that we're going to be dropping very soon are going to be a core part of that, and then other words will come into play as well.
00:45:14.800 - 00:45:48.960, Speaker C: Makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I'm definitely have to look at some of the loot boxes more and dig in myself on that front. I mean, ultimately, you guys have raised this kind of fresh funding round. You're growing a lot in the Solana community. People love your product, but you're also hiring. Could you talk about specific roles that you're looking to kind of bring on or that are currently open at tensor if people want to get even more involved than just kind of the community side of things?
00:45:50.460 - 00:46:20.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I think number one hire we're trying to make right now are our founding engineers. So ideally, you want to bring on two to three, essentially first engineering hires to our team. We've essentially been doing building tensor with just the two of us devs. We recently brought on a BD growth person. He was actually one of our first power users. It just made sense to bring him on. He had a lot of experience using our product as well as in trading in general.
00:46:20.340 - 00:47:01.540, Speaker A: And so right now, we're just focusing on ramping up our dev bandwidth. So anyone who essentially has two to five years of experience working at maybe a high growth startup, maybe we're at a high growth crypto company, perhaps even a trading firm. Like, if you've been working at maybe like Jump HRT, Jane street two Sigma, we want to talk to you. If you're excited to work on building out essentially a new asset class in the financial worlds that back it and you want to do something really cool, work on something that is completely novel, then maybe tensor is the role for you.
00:47:03.520 - 00:47:42.450, Speaker B: Yeah. And to add to that, we've managed to build what we think is a really cool product with just the two of us. And that's because we both, like, are clearly very ownership mindset. I guess we think about, I'm not going to push something to prod, even if Richard doesn't look at it, if I think it's semi half baked, and the people we're looking for are kind of like that, too. We're going to have a very small, tightly knit team of people that care about the product as much as we do. And of course, we're going to give them proportional equity and whatnot rewards, because we want them to feel like owners. But ultimately, as the smartest developer in Salon, Alana, aka Armani, said it on Twitter once, and that really stuck with me.
00:47:42.450 - 00:48:24.448, Speaker B: You need to be in a position with your team where you don't have to review their code because you trust them so much that you hired people that are just so ownership focused. They have such an owner's mindset, and they care about the product. They care about the code so much that you can sleep safely knowing that whatever they push to produce going to work. Hey, if it doesn't work, they fix it quickly. Of course, barring some of the really sensitive parts of the code, security sensitive protocol, like, that's the people we're looking for. So if you're the kind of engineer that is just tired of working in a layered managerial organization where people are telling you what to do, and you basically want to own the product that you're working on, and you want to ship awesome stuff to prod fast and.
00:48:24.464 - 00:48:55.100, Speaker C: Come work at tensor, I think that's a great pitch. I hope you get many applications after this podcast. Kind of projecting forward, like, in one year, like, say, what? What would that look like if all goes well and all, all is kind of, like, perfect in tensor land? Is that scaling the team, what, like, specific things are you looking to integrate on the product side? Kind of like paint the vision for tensor, like one year in the future?
00:48:56.840 - 00:49:53.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I think on the team point, I think the number of people that we hire is a vanity metric, and it's probably counterproductive to hire 20 people and use that as a metric of success. I think for us specifically, our success metric is becoming the backbone for NFT trading on Solana and perhaps other chains. So we want to not just be the only front end for tensor swap, most recently tensor bid and I, perhaps even an order book for nfts. We want other people to build on top of us so that we're essentially the permissionless base layer for all NFT trading and become the central pool of liquidity for everything to do with nfTs. So, giving a concrete example, like someone who is working on an NFT project, and they want to build their own custom marketplace for their community and holders, instead of having to, let's say.
00:49:55.780 - 00:49:56.092, Speaker B: Build.
00:49:56.116 - 00:50:10.600, Speaker A: Their own NFT marketplace, perhaps build, like, amm pools. If they want to do amm pools, they can just use tensor permissionlessly. And we're currently going through an audit, and hopefully we'll be able to open source the entire protocol very soon.
00:50:12.740 - 00:50:34.740, Speaker C: And can you talk? I think I'm a little envious of Ethereum and kind of their open source culture. I think Solana is slowly adopting this, but is slower. Can you talk about some of the thought process behind open sourcing or eventually open sourcing some of the code base.
00:50:36.080 - 00:50:55.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the thought process is very simple, right? If we want the product to be built upon, and if we want the product to be decentralized, controlled by the community, it has to be open source. It's just that simple. The real thing with tensor is that. And this is what we tell every hire that we talk to on the interviews. Like, 80% of the code is not protocol code.
00:50:55.542 - 00:50:55.830, Speaker A: Fuck.
00:50:55.870 - 00:51:13.798, Speaker B: 90% of the code is not protocol code. We spend all of our time optimizing data pipelines and frontends, and it's like performance and Ux. It's the kind of stuff that you're not going to open source because it's all tied into our AWS. Infrared, like, sits on kubernetes. So that stuff isn't going to be open source, but the protocol. Yeah, of course. Yeah, I do agree with you.
00:51:13.798 - 00:51:18.570, Speaker B: I think more teams seem to do it on Solana. Solana is kind of still maturing in that sense, but we'll get there.
00:51:20.990 - 00:52:05.150, Speaker C: I mean, yeah, Solana definitely has some learnings. I think even more recently with Solana outages, I've heard, I mean, multiple different kind of points of view on Solana and kind of some of the hardships that it has gone through personally. Did Solana's, like, going down or any of its kind of ups and downs in terms of FTX or. Yeah, even some of the issues from the code with its performance, did that or did that not sway you or how did that sway you or ultimately your mindset and kind of building in this particular ecosystem?
00:52:06.860 - 00:53:16.064, Speaker A: I think FTX going down and the outages and the aftermath of all that, I think made us more bullish about Solana, specifically what we're building around nfts. Even though Solana did have an outage, I think a couple of weeks ago, NFT volume came right back after the outage recovered, after FTX collapsed, and Solana went to $10 and then subsequently went back up to 30. Now it's hovering around like 20 to 25. We still see the same number of unique active users, like daily active users, we still see the amount of volume that we saw during the middle of the bull run for nfts on Solana. And that tells us there is organic traction here, and people are willing to accept Solana moving fast, breaking things in the name of innovation. Like, Solana is doing a lot of things for the first time that has never been done before, and they're trying to scale Solana to become the chain where people can build web two, like web3, apps that you can't really do on any other chain. And that comes with sacrifices.
00:53:16.064 - 00:53:39.710, Speaker A: Like, yes, there is liveness failure in the recent outages, but you can either do that or move as low as Ethereum and get to scale in five years when all of web3 is basically matured and Solana has 20 different million daily active user apps built on it. It's a trade off. Right.
00:53:40.690 - 00:53:55.034, Speaker B: Just to quickly add to that, I think, first of all, SaaS outages have not been reorganized. And I think that's really important. So there has been faders like the chain needed to restart, but we haven't seen a situation where Solana had to roll back.
00:53:55.082 - 00:53:55.242, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:55.266 - 00:54:27.970, Speaker B: And so that's really, really important to understand. There's failure and there's failure. It's not the same. The other thing to understand is, like, listen to go and listen to the last podcast that Toli did, I think on bankless, if I'm right, where he basically stressed that for them, they were in a situation where chain was struggling with sustaining itself due to spam. So they had to think about quick. They had to, like, roll out a bunch of solutions really quickly because as he himself said it, if they didn't do it, there would be no chain, there would be no apps. It's just like, it's being spammed to death.
00:54:27.970 - 00:54:50.770, Speaker B: And so they were in a situation where, like, guys, we either fixed this, like, yesterday or we're fucked. And so they did that. They fixed it yesterday and kudos to them. And now that they did it, and now that it works, like, yeah, there's a bit of cleanup work and they need to kind of focus a bit more on robustness and stability. And I think if you ask them, what he's probably going to tell you is that it's their number one priority right now. So I don't think they take it lightly. And the arguments where I see on Twitter was like, well, yeah, Solana is going to keep doing this.
00:54:50.770 - 00:55:04.990, Speaker B: Yeah, but isn't that kind of saying, like, well, there's no smart engineers working this problem and are we just kind of going to go home and, like, it's over? Like, I think those guys are thinking about this day and night and, like, I'm. I'm pretty certain that they're going to solve it and everything's going to be fine.
00:55:05.770 - 00:56:00.290, Speaker C: Yeah. I always find that the more technical minded people that I speak to understand the nuances of shipping software, kind of the pros and cons that come with shipping software relatively quickly. And ultimately, it's almost impossible to always ship bug free code, and so they definitely have more empathy towards the outages. But no, definitely appreciate the clarity on that end. No, super interesting. I think what you're building today, I mean, obviously did not exist prior. And that I think your unique focus and obsession on speed has allowed you to pinpoint a underserved part of the market that people are really excited to tap into.
00:56:00.290 - 00:56:11.510, Speaker C: Definitely excited for what you guys are continuing to build in what's going to come for the future.
00:56:13.050 - 00:56:51.780, Speaker A: Appreciate it, man. Yeah, it's hard, right, because we're all building, or you're doing podcasts, you're trying to bring good attention to Solana and other high performing blockchains. It's difficult to do it in a bear market because everyone in web two are hating on you because they think that all of crypto is a scam and they're all basically rugs. Whereas us technical builders, we see the number of users, the number of the excitement in the space, and that there is something here, technology wise as well as adoption. So really appreciate your backing.
00:56:52.120 - 00:57:37.276, Speaker C: Appreciate it. I think, like you guys, I'm definitely not a chain maxi of anything, if anything, a user maxi. And I think in the past it was much more of an ETH Maxi, but really got discouraged again when I paid those super high gas fees and then looking at some of the user metrics. And I think today, Solana is the furthest along in these high throughput chains. One, definitely on the community side, but going through the ups and downs is hardened Solana quite a bit. These new ecosystems that are coming online may be interesting in the future, but I mean, one, they're still relatively small and have not been battle tested to the extent that Solana has. And so I think from that point alone, Solana has a very bright future.
00:57:37.276 - 00:58:12.050, Speaker C: And I think whether it's you or anybody else in the Solana community, their unique point of view is bringing in users. And that's ultimately what I'm excited about. So it definitely going to be an exciting future in 2023. I hope all these kind of rugs or over leveraged events, bank runs ultimately come to an end and we can ultimately get back to the main things that matter, which are building applications, finding product market fit, and getting more users.
00:58:14.110 - 00:58:15.330, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:58:16.190 - 00:58:47.340, Speaker C: Perfect. Well, I think we can probably wrap it up there, guys. Truly appreciate, again, what you're building. Appreciate that you took a, a different point of view in the market. It's much easier to copy and paste things. And I think you guys took a radically different approach and something that was not appreciated until those early users really had so much love for your product. And I think the extra stamp of approval was from those users backing you from the early onset.
00:58:47.340 - 00:58:51.960, Speaker C: So wish you and the team the most success and excited for what's to come.
00:58:53.380 - 00:58:54.480, Speaker A: Thanks, Logan.
00:58:54.860 - 00:58:56.196, Speaker C: Appreciate it, guys. Thank you.
00:58:56.228 - 00:58:56.820, Speaker B: Really appreciate that.
