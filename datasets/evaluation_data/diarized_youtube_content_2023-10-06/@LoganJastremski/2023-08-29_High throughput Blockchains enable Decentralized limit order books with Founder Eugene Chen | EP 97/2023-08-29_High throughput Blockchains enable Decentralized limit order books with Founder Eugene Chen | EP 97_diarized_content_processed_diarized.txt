00:00:00.160 - 00:00:48.730, Speaker A: The protocols on Ethereum, like Uniswap and Aave and maker data really paved the way for the rest of Defi. They're all built under these really, really heavy constraints that Ethereum places on the application developer. You are limited by these twelve second block times, you are limited by the fees, you are limited by, you know, 30 million gas limit per block. And that really constrains what you can do on chain. And so when we came over to the Solana side, it was really a breath of fresh air. Our north star at Ellipsis lab Sol has been to build Defi building blocks that have a chance to outcompete the centralized financial system.
00:00:50.230 - 00:01:33.418, Speaker B: Appreciate you coming on the podcast, Eugene. Really looking forward to this one. I think we're going to dive into a bunch of kind of novel topics. But I would say at the core of this entire podcast is really that high throughput blockchains, in your case, uniquely Solana, ultimately enable new primitives and financial primitives. And I think that really, that infrastructure, by allowing you to build more interesting applications, is really going to open up an entirely new world that is relatively unexplored. And you and the Ellipsis labs team are really on the frontier of that. So, looking forward to the conversation.
00:01:33.554 - 00:01:35.394, Speaker A: Absolutely. Thanks for having me, Logan.
00:01:35.562 - 00:02:14.424, Speaker B: Well, maybe let's just start out with like the high throughput and specifically Solana primitives, because I 100% agree. And when honestly, I was looking at the website that you guys, the team set up, relatively simplistic landing page, but the title of that was high throughput blockchains have enabled the creation of new financial primitives. And I honestly just kind of fell in love with that single sentence because it's so true, but just really not talked about that much, whether in the Solana community or in the crypto community more broadly.
00:02:14.592 - 00:02:57.910, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And maybe we need to add another word in there, enabling the creation of new decentralized financial primitives. I think every financial primitive you can build on Solana, you could build on a centralized server. And we really lean into the benefits you get from decentralization. In particular, auditability, transparency, open access, which may not be as feasible in a centralized world. I think we've seen, even in crypto, many of these more efficient but centralized actors that demand your trust have not quite deserved the trust. And users have gotten burned time and time again because of that.
00:02:57.910 - 00:04:15.682, Speaker A: But yeah, when it comes to Solana, I mean, my background in crypto really came from the Ethereum side. I fell down the crypto rabbit hole in 2020, like many others, sort of bored at home during the pandemic, spent a lot of time looking at DeFi, doing some independent research in mev. And I think the biggest thing that stood out is all of these DeFi protocols, especially these OG protocols on Ethereum, like Uniswap and Aave and Makerdata really paved the way for the rest of DeFi. They're all built under these really, really heavy constraints that Ethereum places on the application developer. You are limited by these twelve second block times, you are limited by the fees, you are limited by 30 million gas limit per block, and that really constrains what you can do on chain. And so when we came over to the Solana side, it was really a breath of fresh air because so many of these constraints are lifted or at least relaxed by the a few orders of magnitude. And so that means there's so much more you can do on the protocol design side.
00:04:15.826 - 00:05:07.198, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah, I kind of like you initially started in the Ethereum world, and it took me a long time to really realize that these other ecosystems did enable a new class of applications. And I would have put myself in the past, historically kind of in the ETH maxi camp and saying that Ethereum had a head start, they already had somewhat of established network effects, and L2s were really going to be the saving grace for the scalability architecture. I'm not sure if you really explored the L2s within the Ethereum ecosystem, but if you had, could you maybe speak to why you chose not to build on a L2 and uniquely decided to build kind of in Solana?
00:05:07.334 - 00:06:02.754, Speaker A: Yeah. So our north star at Ellipsis Labs has always been to build defi building blocks that have a chance to out compete the centralized financial system. And we fundamentally believe that you need a lot of active participants, you need active liquidity for this to be the case, because that's just going to be more efficient than passive liquidity. So we had a pretty good sense where both myself and my co founder come from. HFT background, what types of throughput, what types of fees you're going to need to enable active liquidity on chain. And there are a bunch of other hybrid approaches that I think make sense to some degree as well. Just a different spot that these teams are picking on the trade off curve, where maybe you settle on chain, but the actual matching engine lives off chain.
00:06:02.754 - 00:06:48.400, Speaker A: We're not too interested in that. And when we started the company, we did a pretty thorough dive on all of the infrastructure options available at the time. And Solana was the only one that was performance enough and mature enough where we felt comfortable building on it. It's been a year now, and both Solana and the L two s and all the other chains have progressed another year. I think the L two s are getting to a state where they are more competitive. Certainly there's a lot of liquidity, a fair amount of users and capital on the l two s. But for true active liquidity, the performance is just not good enough.
00:06:48.400 - 00:07:33.280, Speaker A: Right now. There's two aspects here. One is the actual throughput, and then the other is the fees. The fees are really the big thing right now where that make a limit order book liquidity not really viable on the l two s today, where the fees are on the order of single digit cents to double digit cents. And this is still a few orders of magnitude too high for active order book liquidity. So, you know, even after EIP 4844 goes through, maybe that'll decrease the cost by a factor of ten. And then let's even assume that all those cost savings get passed back to the users, which I think is not guaranteed.
00:07:33.280 - 00:08:24.152, Speaker A: I think there's still a lot of room, a lot of improvement required on the fees specifically to make active liquidity viable. I think for these L two ecosystems, there will be new models for Dexs in particular, where, yeah, you can have something that is more active than an amm, certainly more active than XyK amm, maybe concentrated liquidity strategies look very different because you can move your positions with multiple orders of magnitude cheaper than you can on the l one, and you're going to have further block time as well. You definitely can't stick a limit order book on there. So for us, I mean, I think, again, like, looking at it one year later, there's still not really anywhere else we can go. And so for better, for worse, we're, we're sticking with Solana.
00:08:24.256 - 00:09:02.249, Speaker B: Beautiful. I love it. Yeah, the, the throughput. What I've really come to appreciate is that core bottleneck. And I was actually just recording a podcast before this with, uh, avail, kind of creating that data availability layer. And we both agreed that really, you need to maximize the throughput on that base layer as much as possible, really, such that you can enable those cheap fees. And that cheap fees are really what allows you, as we kind of have been alluding to, for these new primitives or these decentralized primitives.
00:09:02.249 - 00:09:53.420, Speaker B: And I think I, when you really push that to the extreme, the cheaper the fees, the higher the throughput, kind of the apex of difficult applications to build is really that on chain order book, and I think that is exactly what you have set out to build. And so I don't think you started at an easy point for what type of applications can be built on these high throughput chains. You kind of went directly for the hardest application. Can you kind of talk USD through the thought process around building specifically an order book on Solana? And maybe not some of the limitations, but since you've started building, some of the challenges that you've kind of occurred or have been able to overcome since you've started, sure.
00:09:54.280 - 00:10:36.262, Speaker A: I would say we went after what we thought was the most obviously useful primitive to build. I think many people land on the order book when they think of this. When you look at DeFi and ask the question, what is missing now? Phoenix is definitely not the first order book on Solana. Serum, which is now open book has existed since early 2020. I think it was one of the first programs deployed to Solana's mainnet beta. I think it was really great for showing, very demonstrating how Solana is differentiated. Really, really great proof of concept, but very little work has been done on the core architecture since theorem was released.
00:10:36.262 - 00:11:19.770, Speaker A: And over the past two or three years, we've learned a lot more about how to build on Solana. We understand a lot of the pain points working with some of these older primitives that have existed for a while. So we set out to rebuild the order book from the ground up. We have a pretty good sense for what market makers care about. A big part of that is market makers, as well as other developers looking to integrate. So a few big pieces there are making the interfaces as clean as possible, making the data visibility as good as possible, really minimizing how many transactions are required for particular actions to go through. And then, yeah, we think we've landed on a much better technical model.
00:11:19.770 - 00:11:25.614, Speaker A: And, yeah, we have a very active team that is committed to seeing this through.
00:11:25.742 - 00:12:05.580, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah. And I think to that point, I mean, serum really did show what was possible, but by, I think even before kind of the FTX collapse, there wasn't really that much work kind of being done on it, if my understanding is cracked and. Bye. Really creating this primitive, I think you're unlocking a world of new applications to start to really compose with ellipsis and Phoenix specifically. And so I'm very excited to see how it ultimately progresses. You guys recently announced that you did a round.
00:12:05.580 - 00:12:17.628, Speaker B: I think that happened a little bit of time ago. Can you talk about, though, kind of the progress that you guys have made in how close are you to actually kind of hitting mainnet.
00:12:17.764 - 00:12:58.950, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So, Phoenix, the protocol has actually been live on Mainnet for a few months now. It's just not that visible to the end user because we don't have a UI. Phoenix so far has done over $250 million of spot volume, which, you know, we're proud of that, but that's also, that's a very bad day for uniswap. So we have a long ways to go here. The core product thesis that we've really been setting out to prove is that on chain order book, liquidity can be sustainable. Because we know today that Amm liquidity on chain is not sustainable.
00:12:58.950 - 00:13:27.648, Speaker A: It sort of loses money in most market conditions. And so we constantly look at market maker profitability. The market makers seem to be doing all right for themselves. TBd, what happens when the marketplace gets more and more competitive? And yeah, I think by the time this podcast goes live, our UI should be live as well. Fingers crossed. That'll be at. Congrats, Phoenix trade.
00:13:27.648 - 00:13:41.488, Speaker A: Thank you. And so that is really going to be our biggest, you know, unveiling to the world. Hey, here's what we built. It's really a first milestone for us. And then we have a long ways to go from here.
00:13:41.624 - 00:14:15.120, Speaker B: That's amazing. And yeah, truly congrats. I know it's hard to launch projects. You're working quite some time to kind of make it polish to go live. So definitely looking forward to being able to interact with that on a streamlined front end. But one thing that you kind of said that caught my eye was particularly around, I mean, 01:00 a.m. and kind of the passive liquidity provision versus order books and being able to actively supply liquidity.
00:14:15.120 - 00:14:39.988, Speaker B: And really the differentiator there is is one profitable and one not profitable in terms of kind of market making. And I think that question is kind of at the heart of the issue. Even outside of the low throughput infrastructure that Ethereum provides versus the high throughput of Solana, is what is sustainable long term. Can you kind of elaborate on that a little bit deeper?
00:14:40.084 - 00:15:10.078, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a few dimensions here. One of them is profitability. The other one is how competitive liquidity is, because liquidity doesn't exist in a vacuum. Right. Liquidity, for a particular trading pair competes against all other venues of liquidity. And so if you have some liquidity provider who's profitable, but their spreads are really, really wide, it turns out that the flow is going to go somewhere else, the trading flow.
00:15:10.078 - 00:16:35.560, Speaker A: And so today we see like, amms are not as competitive as the centralized exchanges. So the vast majority of trading volume goes to centralized exchanges, at least for the pairs where they're listed both on the centralized exchange as well as available on a decentralized exchange. And furthermore, we see most of the price discovery happening there because, yeah, if you're going to make a big trade, you're going to make it on binance, you're not going to make it on uniswap, and you can sort of fix the profitability problem by widening out the spreads, but then your liquidity becomes less useful. And the fundamental problem with the amms is they're not aware of any sort of outside price. They sort of rely on the market to track the prices for them. So if the price on binance moves by 2%, the way the price moves on the amm, is some traders going to come in and trade through one side of the book to make this price move 2%? They're going to then close it out on the other side and collect these gains from arbitrage, which are effectively losses for the LP's. Whereas in an active liquidity model, like a limit order book, the market makers will move their own prices so they're not paying someone else to do it for them.
00:16:35.560 - 00:17:25.770, Speaker A: And then if you're losing less money to this type of flow, we call this toxic flow. These are like trades that in hindsight, the market maker wishes they had not made. If you're making fewer of those or they're not as large, then on average you can quote tighter prices so you can be more competitive. And this is really the crux of the active liquidity versus passive liquidity, or limit order book versus amm. Do the market makers get to set their own prices? Do they get to choose where the liquidity goes? Do they have as much agency there as possible? And then you end up with what we have in traditional finance, which is a bunch of very, very competitive market makers competing to get the non toxic flow. And the way they compete is by providing better prices. If you sit higher on the order book, you're going to get more of the flow.
00:17:25.770 - 00:17:30.114, Speaker A: And so the externality here is you have better liquidity on that venue.
00:17:30.242 - 00:18:36.850, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it is all fascinating, I mean, how all the pieces come together. Specifically, there's kind of being able to quote the best prices, which ultimately enables more liquidity, and then also the ability for the either market makers to move or adjust the pricing of their quotes. And fundamentally, that's just not possible. On. So as you mentioned, you have this toxic order flow that sets losses for LP's and amms. And then on a traditional order book you have to ultimately have more throughput or enable, have better infrastructure because you're doing more recalculations pretty much in real time. And that is uniquely enabled by a Solana type architecture that allows you to do lots of these bids and asks, um, so you kind of have to have the infrastructure to enable it.
00:18:36.850 - 00:18:42.706, Speaker B: But once you enable it, uh, fundamentally, ultimately enables better price discovery.
00:18:42.818 - 00:18:44.498, Speaker A: Yep, I think that's all fair in.
00:18:44.514 - 00:20:06.326, Speaker B: Terms of, I mean, you kind of mentioned in my kind of endgame. I'm curious, because obviously in a decentralized world you have to have, um, validation or these validators come to agreement with a certain kind of consensus lag. That information has to be propagated from one computer to many computers. And I think the beautiful thing about a Solana type architecture is that it keeps all the liquidity unified into a single state where you can think of exchanges as either individual l, two s or sharded ecosystems that ultimately fragment liquidity, but they currently have tighter spreads. I guess my question to you is, looking forward in the future, in a world that order books are kind of prolific on chain, you are able to have much deeper liquidity because everything is ultimately in one shared state. You still have slightly higher spreads because of that decentralized nature, but deeper liquidity because everything is kind of priced in one global state machine versus independent kind of order books on centralized exchanges. Do you have an opinion on kind of where majority of trading ultimately takes place?
00:20:06.478 - 00:21:13.012, Speaker A: Well, we really want to get to a world where the majority of trading takes place on chain in a fully transparent and auditable way. To get there, you really need this competitive aspect to catch up. And then at the end of the day, what really matters is where the non toxic order flow is coming from. So what this means is like, do the users at the end of the day choose to trade on binance, or do they choose to trade on Phoenix or some other on chain menu? Because if the order books on Phoenix are, let's say, both tighter and deeper, but all of the non toxic flow and all the price discovery is going to another venue like binance or Coinbase. What that means is everything left on Phoenix, all the flow on Phoenix is going to be toxic, and it's probably going to be unprofitable for the, for the market makers. So at the end of the day, the users decide, right? The users pick their venue to trade, and users or infrastructure providers, and wherever they're trading is the place that's going to have the most edge in terms of being able to have profitable market makers along with deep liquidity.
00:21:13.156 - 00:21:50.532, Speaker B: Interesting. So in your point of view, ultimately, I mean, the toxic order flow versus non toxic order flow is really just determined by kind of the average person that is trading on the exchange, whether it's centralized or decentralized. And where that price discovery happens is really the, what enables market makers that are making the markets to ultimately be profitable, uh, ultimately kind of creating that flywheel that's self fulfilling of more people trade here, you have better prices, more people want to market, make there.
00:21:50.636 - 00:22:06.380, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. The non toxic flow is really what brings everything together. And so the natural conclusion is you really need to compete on product. You need to compete on product against the other decentralized venue as well as the centralized venues to get the users to show up.
00:22:06.460 - 00:22:40.532, Speaker B: And maybe kind of going off that point, you ultimately release Phoenix, which was the backend of your crankless order book. And now you've ultimately enabled the front end, or will enable in the front end in the coming weeks. Can you talk about the product focus that you took to really entice, say, the average trader to use Phoenix instead of a kind of centralized exchange or go to another venue for price discovery?
00:22:40.646 - 00:23:40.204, Speaker A: Yeah. So it is difficult to compete directly with the centralized exchanges because in some ways you just can never match their performance. They can give you a trade confirmation much more quickly than the blockchain can come to consensus. There's a couple things we like to lean into again. The biggest one is like how much do you need to trust versus what can you verify and so on chain with Phoenix, what you can do, if you'd like, is you can take a look at the source code, which is available. You can see, okay, when I send this instruction to the blockchain, what code is going to get executed? You can make sure that no one has special priority encoded into the, into the program itself. If someone is faster than you, it's just because they can hit the blockchain faster.
00:23:40.204 - 00:24:33.384, Speaker A: It's this shared execution layer. You don't have any sort of guarantee like this with centralized exchange. Also on the centralized side, yeah, you don't really know what they're doing with the funds, whereas with a fully on chain program you can just verify that the assets match the liabilities. You can verify that there's no instruction for someone to like withdraw all of the funds or borrow against the user funds. Now is that enough? It's not clear. I think there's a lot of other sources of flow for an on chain exchange, the most obvious one is demand that comes from composability. And so here again, leaning into the shared state narrative, we sort of expect, and really frankly hope for a world where there's a lot more applications on chain that people are using.
00:24:33.384 - 00:24:48.448, Speaker A: Some of them, not all of them, some of them will have some demand for composable liquidity on chain. And that composition, that type of composition, atomically permissionless composition, is fundamentally not possible with a centralized exchange.
00:24:48.584 - 00:26:12.900, Speaker B: Yeah, it is fascinating in terms of, I think one of the most beautiful elements of a fully decentralized order book like you're building, and I think you kind of touched upon it, was that every node in the network is really, especially in Solana's case with turbine, that all to all communication is really emphasized. All nodes are receiving pretty much all kind of new updates within 15 milliseconds of that leader submitting the transaction to the network, which I think is the most democratic trading system out there, because as you mentioned, there's no guarantees on a centralized party that you have the most up to date information where on a blockchain that is all very clear. And even stepping back to the more tradfi world, it's interesting that to level the playing field in terms of sophisticated traders, they give them the exact same cable length that they all hook up to a box, in terms of ensuring that no one actually has a competitive advantage. But by enabling kind of the all to all communications, all nodes receiving all information practically at the same time, really opens up a new kind of venue, in my opinion, for different trading firms.
00:26:13.640 - 00:26:54.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I think especially right now, the barrier to entry is still relatively low. If you want to be a competitive on chain trader on Solana, I think no matter what though, let's say the trading volumes increase by a factor of 100 or a factor of 10,000. Yeah. The more skilled trading firms are still likely to win the majority of the profits. We just really want to make sure that we set up a system such that as these players get better and better at trading on chain, that results in these positive externalities for the users, like better prices, deeper liquidity, stuff like that.
00:26:54.758 - 00:27:19.500, Speaker B: No, I think it's a beautiful vision in the world that say trading volumes ultimately jump 100 x, 1000 x, 10,000 x. Will the underlying infrastructure, in your opinion, be able to support that, ie Solana, or do you need more throughput to ultimately enable that, something that is going to be enabled by firedancer?
00:27:19.960 - 00:28:10.078, Speaker A: I think there's a couple of things you need. You will almost certainly need more throughput, more single threaded throughput in particular. And then I think a much closer look will have to be taken at the network incentives, because right now, I think there are a lot of assumptions built into Solana where it's not quite battle tested in all dimensions. And you can imagine, as the bounty for attacking the consensus mechanism goes up, like, if there's 10,000 x the trading volume, you should expect more and more sophisticated actors to be attempting that sort of thing. And I think there's a lot of research and engineering work that needs to be done to ensure that Solana can still thrive in that world.
00:28:10.214 - 00:28:15.090, Speaker B: Are there any things that jump out at you that are a cause for concern?
00:28:17.390 - 00:28:51.004, Speaker A: There's a couple pieces. I think. One, the consensus mechanism, definitely could use some formalism. As far as I'm aware, it's not formally defined anywhere. So the first step to being able to analyze what the consensus mechanism, how it performs under different types of attacks, is to define it. And then the second is the fee mechanism, which is currently, like, not incentive compatible in a few different ways. So these things will likely get exploited in a world where trading on chain is extremely competitive.
00:28:51.132 - 00:29:21.892, Speaker B: And maybe to expand upon the latter part, specifically on the fees, Solana ultimately, and Ethereum currently, started with global fee markets. It has since moved to localized fee markets that allow it to auction off single parts of state or single applications and price those individually. Is that kind of the concern that you raise, that potentially those will be too costly if the state becomes too contentious?
00:29:21.996 - 00:30:11.140, Speaker A: So I think, at a high level, the mechanism that you describe makes sense. This is not quite what has been implemented. I think the priority fees on Solana today, they sort of have this side effect of kind of doing what you described in this probabilistic way. There's a lot that is not really enforced, and then there's all these incentives, for example, striking side deals with validators. So one simple example here is right now. If I submit a transaction with a priority fee to the Solana network, if my transaction is included, the validator who's building the block or proposing the block, they get half of that priority fee, and then the other half is burned. Let's pretend that total priority fee was one soul.
00:30:11.140 - 00:30:39.016, Speaker A: So the validator got half a soul, and then half a soul is burned. If I have a side deal with a validator, I can submit them some payment out of band. Let's call it three, four, 0.75 sol. So they'll collect that sort of as their. And then they'll guarantee that, oh, I get priority placement and no fee is going to get burned. And so this gives me an advantage trading against everybody else because I can bid a smaller priority fee for a larger effect.
00:30:39.016 - 00:30:55.472, Speaker A: And the existence of these ideals, one sort of points towards the fee mechanism being broken in some ways. And then two, it's highly centralizing because the large players are going to be able to strike these deals or vertically integrate to create these situations for themselves.
00:30:55.616 - 00:31:27.602, Speaker B: Interesting. And I guess with Solana specifically having 400 millisecond slot times, ultimately with a goal to kind of make that say half, around 200 milliseconds. Do you feel like that even with the smaller slot times, that still allows the opportunity for traders to coordinate with validators and get some of these cheaper fees by working with them directly?
00:31:27.706 - 00:31:45.158, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, the way this would look would just be a validator opens up like some side port where you can submit transactions with them through this? Yeah, just through the separate channel, they'll modify the validator client to selectively include them based on some algorithm. I don't think the block times really affect too much here.
00:31:45.254 - 00:32:25.724, Speaker B: Makes sense. Interesting. It is fascinating. I think what's been interesting to me is by being really the first blockchain to enable high throughput. Solana has really experienced a lot of these unique primitives earlier on, and both the pros in terms of like what applications they enable, like order books, but also some of the cons and that they're the first ones kind of figuring it out in real time. It is kind of fascinating to watch them deal with it and kind of speed run a lot of this.
00:32:25.852 - 00:33:02.442, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think, you know, since Solana went to Mainnet beta and I, I believe March 2020, the usage has sort of always been there. And it seems like Solana Labs has basically been putting out fires from 2020 through 2022, and now it's finally in a state where, yeah, the activity has calmed down for a little bit and so it's a really good time to make some of these long term investments on the research and engineering side to ensure that when activity does increase by multiple orders of magnitude, the chain is robust enough to handle it.
00:33:02.546 - 00:34:19.176, Speaker B: Yep, I fully agree. I think we're all thankful that there hasn't been any downtime in quite some time. The reliability has been improving and with these 2nd, 3rd, 4th implementations of clients, specifically the fire to answer client that will also allow more throughput, will add the robust nature to the network so that hopefully there's less issue in the going forward. But also, as you mentioned, can focus on some of the more minute details today that will probably only surface themselves later down the line as we truly scale, because I often think people forget just how small one the trading volume, but also just people using blockchains truly is today. It's not very big compared to, I think, where we had all liked to get it in terms of, I guess, I mean, you are obviously very focused on the order book aspect. You kind of built it slightly different, and correct me if I'm wrong, than different order books in the past, specifically being crankless for people that are not familiar with what a crank is. Can you talk about what a crank is and why you ultimately decided to go with the crankless architecture?
00:34:19.298 - 00:35:26.480, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a reasonably technical topic, but at a high level, openbook and other order book implementations on Solana require asynchronous settlement. And so that means is if you are a market maker and you want to make some trades, you or someone else needs to perform this asynchronous action, which we call like pulling a crank, to settle the trades and receive the funds to either like perform more trades or do something else. And so what this means is, your settlement is not atomic. So there's some composability, or at least atomic composability throughout the window certainly affects the UX as well. So if you go place a limit order and you get filled, you don't quite just see the funds in your wallet or in your account, you gotta click some button to settle it. And I think, like all else equal, everyone would just prefer to not have the step. The reason it exists is, yeah, for some reasonably, reasonably technical limitations that are imposed upon salon developers.
00:35:26.480 - 00:36:00.472, Speaker A: And yeah, we just have a slightly different design. We're able to remove this so that trading is atomic. And yeah, I think if we were building this three years ago, you wouldn't really know like, oh, how bad is it to have a crank? What does it actually mean? It's like somewhat centralizing, or you depend on this like central public good cranker to be running all the time. If that stops working, obviously it's permissionless, anyone can do it. But in practice, well, in practice, in the past, Alameda was just running it and yeah, sometimes it would go down and then the serum markers would just stop running for a while.
00:36:00.576 - 00:37:08.690, Speaker B: Interesting. Now, again, I think it goes back to, I mean, Solana really enabled this new category, and with that were the pros and cons of applications are new and novel, and were not possible, physically not possible to be created on these earlier networks, but were also experiencing what works and what doesnt work within those categories and kind of going down the id ideal maze within that. I think one thing, though, ive kind of been impressed by in general, has really been the quality of teams that are really now focusing on Solana and the high throughput networks and deciding to say, look, this is a infrastructure that allows us to make more interesting applications, and particularly we want to build our application here because of what it enables. Can you kind of talk to one, just the quality of engineers and other teams that you've been working with within the Solana ecosystem and maybe even further speak to some of the things that you're excited for in the Solana Defi ecosystem?
00:37:09.350 - 00:38:20.336, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, at a high level, I'd say I'm constantly impressed by the caliber of the people we meet just doing work in the ecosystem, whether it's talking to other protocol teams, talking to people who work on the core validator, client traders on Solana. People understand these systems with a lot of depth and are also quite passionate about making Solana be the, you know, live up to its potential. I think on the, on the application side, one thing that is quite refreshing is to see some more teams come along that are building things that are not just, you know, Uniswap clones or Aave clones. Again, I think, like, Uniswap and Aave make a ton of sense, but, you know, they were designed under these really heavy constraints of the Ethereum L1. And so copying those protocols line for line almost kind of misses the point. You end up with like, yeah, uniswap with lower transaction fees or aave with lower transaction fees, but there's actually so much more you can do. So one example, I guess, here is Lulu finance.
00:38:20.336 - 00:39:12.610, Speaker A: I don't actually know the team there, but they're building an order book based borrowing and lending. I think this is clearly where borrowing and lending ought to go. And we see a lot of the problems with these pool based models besides, like, the efficiency, the massive losses in efficiency, the inability to compute market based interest rates, there's these fundamental incentive problems with the governors of the protocol are not necessarily aligned with the borrowers and the lenders. I think taking on these individual loans, I believe they're a fixed term, but I'm sure they could become variable term, or you could roll them over. I think that makes a ton of sense. And you end up with a lot more efficiency, you end up with much better price discovery on the interest rates. So, yeah, at least watching that team from afar, I like what they're doing.
00:39:12.610 - 00:39:37.026, Speaker A: I think there's a lot more to come in Defi, and I think the other obvious titan in Solana Defi is the mango markets team. They've built decentralized perps that also live fully on chain. I think their commitment to the DeFi ethos is very impressive and their product is very good.
00:39:37.138 - 00:39:56.230, Speaker B: Yeah, it is fascinating. By enabling that core service of an orderbook, the other applications that can be built on top of that, that other team, are they utilizing ultimately what you've built with Phoenix as the order book on the backend?
00:39:56.570 - 00:40:18.540, Speaker A: They are not. Right now. I believe their order book is a heavily modified version of the old Sarah mortar book. But yeah, I'm sure some teams will come along and build perps on top of a Phoenix order book and a bunch of other stuff that will either draw liquidity from or add liquidity to Phoenix directly.
00:40:18.650 - 00:40:49.130, Speaker B: And over the long term, I guess by having competing order books specifically on chain for a single ecosystem, the core value prop there goes back to like toxic versus non toxic order flow and enabling or kind of getting market makers to make markets have, quote, those tighter spreads and also get the retail to have the non toxic order flow, creating that flywheel for one specific order book versus another.
00:40:50.070 - 00:41:49.640, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, there's, I mean, I think it's in general good to have as much competition as possible. Like, of course, you run into liquidity fragmentation on the spot side. At least that does get solved by aggregators. So if users are hitting the aggregators and the aggregators well implemented, then the venue that receives the flow is going to be the one that has the most competitive price. So this is kind of the best case scenario for the chain and the ecosystem in terms of competition, where no one has this exclusive order flow to their venue. I think it's more complicated with derivatives because these don't compose in a way that's as nice as the spot trading does. But yeah, I think in crypto generally, certainly within DeFi, and even more so within this really large design space of Defi and Solana, no one can confidently say, like, I know exactly what the world is going to look like five years from now, and we're going to build for that world.
00:41:49.640 - 00:42:38.942, Speaker A: So I think having multiple teams sort of focus on the same North Star, taking different approaches, maybe vastly different approaches, maybe slightly different approaches, is ultimately super good for the ecosystem. I think we've seen a lot of the benefits here on the ethereum side where like how many dexs have there been on Ethereum with them? Small to large deviations from a unisot model or on the lending side, we see euler finance that came along and just built a better protocol than Aave, a few pretty key improvements. And this is the point of having an open market, a permissionless market for innovation, where anyone can deploy whatever programs they want on the chain and, yeah, see if they can get users.
00:42:39.046 - 00:43:31.698, Speaker B: Yeah, that user adoption piece is massive. And I think even today it's fascinating to me that Uniswap does have as much volume as it does considering how few users are actually on chain. Comparative to, say, web two, it is pretty impressive, I agree. But long term, I think you and I would both agree that you can kind of multiply out the amount of users on chain, hopefully enabled by kind of these lower fees that allow engineers such as yourself to build these more interesting primitives. Combined with the lower fees, you can kind of hit a different level of scale where each of the transactions are lesser in total volume, but kind of get made up by more people actually interacting with onshade.
00:43:31.874 - 00:44:40.394, Speaker A: Yeah. So we often get this question from investors, how do you bring users over from the EVM side? And this is just like a question that I'm not that interested in, because if you look at the total number of crypto users, it's so small relative to the global population, it's a rounding error. So for Solana to win on the user side, yeah, you can focus on the Ethereum users, or you can focus on the other 8 billion people out there who don't use crypto whatsoever, who maybe have heard of bitcoin and ethereum, but certainly have never done anything on chain and build products to serve those people where the current difference in usage levels, I think, just doesn't matter that much. The moat that the Ethereum ecosystem has that is much scarier is on the developer side, both on developer tools and developer experience, as well as just, you know, if you're going to build a new application today on chain, you know, the default place to do it is somewhere in the Ethereum ecosystem that I think is much more threatening to Solana in the long run.
00:44:40.522 - 00:45:27.296, Speaker B: Do you feel like I've always. I get this question a lot. I'm surprised that investors are so focused on the EVM personally considered mostly the fact, just as you mentioned, that there are very few users. But I also think that engineers, in terms of people actually doing things within the crypto ecosystem, is relatively small. I think electric capital puts out a report every year highlighting the developers across all different ecosystems. And if I recall correctly, it was approximately 8000 full time engineers within the ecosystem. When you compare that to, even, say, a Google or Amazon, it's only a fraction of their total engineering base.
00:45:27.296 - 00:46:08.140, Speaker B: I definitely agree that the engineering experience in terms of tools is more robust on the Ethereum ecosystem. But when you look at the fundamental performance, and it's not literally a ten x or 100 x, I mean, just talking about fees, there literally can be 1000 x difference in fees even in terms of l two s to a high throughput network like Solana. To me, the class of applications that are ultimately enabled, I think will make up, and I think the lack of user experience or developer complexity today, and over time, that developer complexity will be lessened to the fact that they're probably comparable.
00:46:08.920 - 00:46:47.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a very plausible world we end up in. I think I look at the velocity of the EVM tools and, like, the rate at which they're getting better, and it seems higher than it is on Solana. I think perhaps this Solana developers chewing glass meme has been taken a little bit too literally. Where. No, actually, I think we should be making things as easy as possible for Solana developers, where the more people who breathe the Solana docks and end up actually deploying something, the more shots on goal. Solana has to find that killer application.
00:46:47.546 - 00:47:14.070, Speaker B: I agree. It should be as easy for application engineers to deploy their application, and they shouldn't have to worry about the infrastructure underlying it. And I think the unfortunate thing is, even though that's getting better in terms of raw performance in the high throughput ecosystems like Solana, there is a still clear disconnect by the developer infrastructure. And that can always be improved as well.
00:47:14.370 - 00:47:15.170, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:47:15.290 - 00:47:31.858, Speaker B: In terms of maybe shifting the conversation, I think the Ellipso Labs teams has also a great kind of research report and research writing. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about the research pieces that you have put out, kind of your goal with it and what you're looking to do there.
00:47:31.954 - 00:48:34.540, Speaker A: Yeah, so, and I would say this is not really an elliptis labs project. This is more of like, almost like just like a side project where we try to collaborate with researchers across crypto, not just the Solana ecosystem. We call it umbra research. And, you know, we chatted a little bit before about how I think there's a bunch of important research problems that Solana needs to solve and relatively little research talent looking at Solana. So this is sort of the gap that we're trying to fill with umbra research at a high level. I would describe our mandate as identifying the existential threats that Solana faces specifically on the technical research side, and then addressing them to the extent possible. So, I mean, a big part of that is identifying, yeah, identifying what the problems are, putting out research level specs for how the system currently works, because those don't really exist.
00:48:34.540 - 00:49:59.688, Speaker A: Trying to solve these problems, trying to collaborate with folks around the crypto research community who are almost all focus on the Ethereum side to come take a look at some of the interesting problems that we have on Solana, which are some very similar, some quite different from what exists on Ethereum. And I think these cross ecosystem collaborations just generally tend to be very fruitful. I think we've seen a lot of this between the Ethereum world and the cosmos world, and for whatever reason, we've seen a lot less between the Solana world and some of these other ecosystems. So I think this is a good opportunity to learn from some of the other chains, collaborate with them and, yeah, at the end of the day, get some of these difficult research problems solved, because, yeah, if the load on Solana, if the value that Solana secures increases by a few orders of magnitude, we don't really know how well the chain will hold up. Whereas on the Ethereum side, which I would say has the most developed research community, I think a lot of the problems are just very, very well understood. The threat models are very well understood. There is this level of rigor that the community demands that doesn't quite exist on Solana today.
00:49:59.824 - 00:50:45.124, Speaker B: Yeah, I would also. I agree there needs to be a lot more research focus. To me, in my eyes, one thing that I've seen as a very clear kind of differentiation between the two communities has kind of been more of a research driven approach where you research and then implementate versus kind of implementing the low hanging fruit and then kind of iterating on Solana. And I think that's like, practically kind of shown out wherever ethereum is much more research heavily, and in my opinion, Solana is much more engineering heavily on kind of practicality sense, but you need a combination of both. One without the other is not super useful.
00:50:45.292 - 00:51:19.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think Solana's engineering today has been an advantage for, I guess, all of Solana's life. And, yeah, there's some deficiencies on the research side which we hope to help shore up. And I think we also can't expect that the engineering lead that Solana has today is going to last forever. I think it's very, very unlikely to last forever. So, yeah, push the advantage there while we can, but I think, yeah, it's important to also recognize that it's like nowhere close to a finished project.
00:51:19.362 - 00:51:34.586, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, are there any other ecosystems? I mean, L2s, layer threes, layer fours, cosmos chains, app chains, other high throughput ecosystems that you're uniquely interested, or are you pretty much heads down on.
00:51:34.618 - 00:52:18.466, Speaker A: Solana, we're very heads down. I think I have much less time than I would like to explore what's going on in some of these other ecosystems besides Ethereum, which always has a bunch of interesting stuff going on. Cosmos has got to be the next. I think they come out with a lot of original thought around some of these really core questions in crypto, like, what is a blockchain, really? What does it mean to be sovereign? Can you separate out some of these different pieces? We get these different pieces of a blockchain, alternate original approaches to mitigating Mev, stuff like that.
00:52:18.598 - 00:52:47.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it is fascinating. I mean, all the different communities, I think, really show the different cultural aspects, and I think it's all fascinating to me, just the different approaches that they're taking and the emphasis of their values. But then I always come back to, all right, the industry is small. We need users. Let's experiment and just get as much user as possible, and then we can figure out some of this stuff later.
00:52:47.810 - 00:53:29.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we can walk and chew gum at the same time. I think there's enough people working in crypto where some people can work on the infra, some people can work at the application layer. But, yeah, I think I generally agree. We probably need way more experiments on the user facing application side where one killer application can really make or break the ecosystem. I think we've seen this already in the past with step in driving a ton of usage to Solana, even if there are some very fundamental problems with their model. And we're seeing it today with friendtech on basechain where, yeah, they have like 100,000 users in a week.
00:53:29.990 - 00:53:30.982, Speaker B: That is impressive.
00:53:31.086 - 00:53:52.386, Speaker A: At least single digit, thousands of dailies. And again, who knows if the model fundamentally works. But I think pretty undeniable that applications like that really drive a ton of usage, really introduce crypto to a ton of new people who are like, for the first time doing something on chain, however much is abstracted away from them.
00:53:52.498 - 00:54:24.994, Speaker B: 100%. I fully agree. In terms of maybe kind of looking forward to next year or maybe a year or two in the future, are there any things that you are uniquely excited about? Know the team is ultimately the end state is enable, uh, trading. That is ultimately better than kind of their centralized counterparts. Uh, in that vision, is there either things that are supportive or kind of adjacent to that that you are excited about as well?
00:54:25.082 - 00:55:07.522, Speaker A: Uh, we're really focused on Defi. Um, I spend like 90% of my time thinking about Defi. I think outside of Defi. One thing I would like to see explore that. I'm not sure how much is really getting explored is looking into more of this design space around nfts, where nfts are really these ownable, creatable pieces of code that live on chain. And so far, what we've seen for these, like, what is the use case for this piece of code is actually just a string that is like a link to some jpeg in s three. It seems like there's a lot more you can do with it potentially.
00:55:07.522 - 00:55:40.080, Speaker A: I don't know what it looks like, but nfts are like, they're turing complete or they're roughly Turin complete. And yeah, there's probably more to explore than pointer to s three, especially again on Solana. Yeah. Like something besides this, like 10,000 profile picture meta. I'm excited to see something new. I'm excited to get away from the arguments about, oh, should royalties be enforced and not enforced? I feel like we understand all the arguments there, but. Yeah, I don't know who is working on this.
00:55:40.080 - 00:55:41.484, Speaker A: I hope someone is.
00:55:41.572 - 00:55:48.280, Speaker B: Yep. It is funny that it's kind of just a pointer to an AWS database.
00:55:48.620 - 00:55:51.972, Speaker A: Yeah. Even the pictures don't tend to be stored on chain.
00:55:52.116 - 00:56:14.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll learn. Except, I guess, into continuing to iterate. Um, the final question that I was kind of thinking of, uh, is escaping me in terms. Yeah, I forgot. Um, is there any ecosystem that you think is just like, not going to make it, or is that like vastly overhyped?
00:56:14.850 - 00:56:28.510, Speaker A: Um, I mean, again, I don't spend too much time looking at other ecosystems, so I'm sure there's a. There's a bunch that are not going to make it that I'm just like, you know, not really aware of. But maybe.
00:56:30.250 - 00:56:46.630, Speaker B: Share your most spicy kind of opinion within blockchain ecosystems today and then maybe follow up with what is like one alpha or some alpha that you could share with the listeners as well. And we'll round it out with that one spicy take. One alpha.
00:56:47.050 - 00:56:59.704, Speaker A: If you want spicy takes, you can take a look at my twitter, which is euroxchettrader. There's frequently spicy takes. And if you want alpha, I don't really have any, so. Sorry about that.
00:56:59.872 - 00:57:48.990, Speaker B: I think you have lots of alpha in terms of order books, toxic flow, non toxic flow, even on the research side. So definitely would encourage people to follow along with your research. But Eugene, really appreciate you coming on the podcast, sharing out the vision of really, I would say, what high throughput blockchains like Lana enable and what type of applications that you can build. Also the fact that engineers of such high pedigree, with such thought and depth to their knowledge, are really building in this lana ecosystem, and I expect that fully to continue. The unique primitives that you're building, along with other things that we'll be able to plug into the order book, I think are only just starting and so fascinating to see how the ecosystem will unfold. You coming on the podcast.
