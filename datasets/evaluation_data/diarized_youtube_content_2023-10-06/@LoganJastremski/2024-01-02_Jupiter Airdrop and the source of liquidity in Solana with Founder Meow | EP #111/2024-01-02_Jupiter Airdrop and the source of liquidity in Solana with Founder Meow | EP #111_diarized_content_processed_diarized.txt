00:00:00.120 - 00:00:08.014, Speaker A: No, I don't. I don't survive. I win, you know? Right. No, no, no, surviving for. No, no, surviving is for, um, you know, surviving for skill. Yeah. But it was brutal.
00:00:08.014 - 00:00:21.334, Speaker A: Holy shit. When your competitor was, like, doing 2000% a UI, right? I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, that was. I mean, I never said this before and stuff, because most interviews I've been on have been just talking about other stuff in general.
00:00:21.462 - 00:00:21.726, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:21.758 - 00:00:23.486, Speaker A: But since I fuck it, right, I just say stay stuck.
00:00:23.518 - 00:00:23.782, Speaker C: Right.
00:00:23.846 - 00:00:32.250, Speaker A: You know? Yeah. So if you combine. If you combine all three things, um, the survival reason, like the survivor, the survival reason, the tragic reason, the team reason, it becomes pretty fucking clear.
00:00:36.170 - 00:01:05.146, Speaker B: Miao, super excited to have you on the podcast. We were talking a little bit before recording, and it's just been amazing to me, your guys journey. I think in my past, life at Tesla shipping was one of the key priorities of our successful team, and I think that is embodied 100% in Jupiter. And so I've been continuously impressed by how quickly you guys ship and just how great the product has actually become. So congratulations just to start it off.
00:01:05.298 - 00:01:07.218, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it.
00:01:07.234 - 00:01:09.978, Speaker B: It's been super impressive, but thank you for coming on the podcast.
00:01:10.154 - 00:01:19.282, Speaker A: So, one thing to also say as well, since we are doing that, is that, you know, I think you guys have been one of the most, like, consistent supporters of Solana.
00:01:19.426 - 00:01:19.706, Speaker C: Right?
00:01:19.738 - 00:01:23.738, Speaker A: I mean, honestly, I think it was very easy to support Solana three years ago, right.
00:01:23.794 - 00:01:25.990, Speaker B: You know, it was.
00:01:26.520 - 00:01:27.000, Speaker A: We.
00:01:27.080 - 00:01:40.752, Speaker B: We kind of joke internally at frictionless. We were a ugly duckling swimming upstream, kind of trouting Solana in the high throughput narrative. But recently, we've become a beautiful white swan that is swimming downstream.
00:01:40.896 - 00:01:51.096, Speaker A: And you know what? You deserve it. Right? Because. Because, I mean, after the. After the duckling have swam upstream for so long, right? The masters get toned, you know, you look really hot now and everything.
00:01:51.168 - 00:01:51.376, Speaker C: Right?
00:01:51.408 - 00:02:30.106, Speaker A: No, but seriously, I mean, like, it was very easy to be hyping Solana early on, but I think those that stayed on and proved their matter over the last year especially, I think I have a very, very deep appreciation. And one of the big reasons why I'm really happy, I'll be honest with you, I'm actually much happier now. Even this last year, I was actually really happy. I think mainly because I think the quality, even though activity, price, everything just went out gutted. But the quality of people I was working with just skyrocketed. I wasn't kidding.
00:02:30.218 - 00:02:30.538, Speaker C: Right.
00:02:30.594 - 00:02:40.762, Speaker A: So it's like. Because I think before that, it was just so clear that there's so many people, not very serious. But then over the last year, I mean, again, it wasn't easy, right?
00:02:40.786 - 00:03:15.490, Speaker B: But so happy, 100%. I mean, to me, I joined the crypto market in 2017 and the apple market. And I mean, the only reason that I kind of in the spot today is because I stuck around in 2018 and 2019. And at that time it was kind of funny because all the bitcoin people were dancing on ethereum's grave saying like, it was only used for icos and scam and that it was never coming back. And I feel like Solana had a similar moment like post FTX where everybody's like, even VC's were like, don't use Solana. We're not going to invest in you. It's going to zero.
00:03:15.490 - 00:03:25.020, Speaker B: But the builders, the VC's that stayed around like, they really rallied together and I think that's kind, kind of that core community and backbone that's shaping the community today.
00:03:25.840 - 00:03:47.264, Speaker A: It's actually really interesting to say that, right. Because like, I mean, easily, right, easily. Several, many, many of the VC's that were like openly, like praising Solana at the peak moment messaged us and they were like, guys, are you still going on Solana?
00:03:47.392 - 00:03:47.632, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:47.656 - 00:03:58.012, Speaker A: You know, have you thought going to Ethereum or. Sweet. I thought I heard that. Really cool. Have you heard of move? Move? I'm not even kidding, seriously. It was actually really astonishing to see that change.
00:03:58.076 - 00:03:58.324, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:58.372 - 00:03:58.700, Speaker A: You know?
00:03:58.740 - 00:03:58.940, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:58.980 - 00:04:19.485, Speaker A: And then, hey, hello, how's it going? So it's like you must be very familiar with the dynamic, right. So I think, yeah, I think. But again, to your point, I think one thing that people don't understand in this crypto space is that because things just seem to just suddenly work, right. Because in crypto, when things work, things pop.
00:04:19.627 - 00:04:20.385, Speaker C: Right. All right.
00:04:20.457 - 00:04:31.441, Speaker A: So I think. But, but people don't actually know that. Like, everyone I know that does well, in bull markets, they've been working their ass off in like two or three, easily at least two or three bear markets before.
00:04:31.505 - 00:04:31.729, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:31.769 - 00:04:38.825, Speaker A: There's a certain, like, training you get from, like, understanding, you know, things from those moments that you don't get bull markets, right. You know?
00:04:38.857 - 00:05:01.322, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, 100%. I think the people that stick around, like, you have to kind of eat shit for a while. Like, you have to go through the hard times. And I admire the team that you have built and would love to maybe start the podcast there. It's just like, how did you start this, like, crypto journey? How did ultimately Jupiter come about to.
00:05:01.346 - 00:05:35.592, Speaker A: Be, oh, wow, crypto journey. I mean I would just skip forward a few years, right, and just talk about. So I think I really started becoming, I would say that I was so I was previously an advisor to instead of they are number ten TVL or something. And then there's Kyber and then there's blockfolio. You might have heard these three projects. I also started WBTC, right? You know, the rep token, replicoin and then also founding contributor to a project called Handshake as well. So I think I've been.
00:05:35.592 - 00:06:07.434, Speaker A: So before getting involved in Solana, I had been working on several DeFi and non DeFi. So I would say that even before, even before getting started on Solana, I think my experience was pretty, like I crossed my experience between a new blockchain handshake, consumer ad portfolio and also a bunch of Defi protocols. So I'm actually pretty familiar with stuff and all those things certainly informed a lot of decisions as I started this project as well.
00:06:07.562 - 00:06:19.374, Speaker B: So originally kind of starting out advisor with different projects, hands in a bunch of different ecosystems, built up that kind of base knowledge. But how did kind of that pivot to like being like I want to become a builder?
00:06:19.542 - 00:06:24.358, Speaker A: No, I mean I was actually always extremely intense. I was actually always extremely involved.
00:06:24.494 - 00:06:24.766, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:24.798 - 00:06:31.742, Speaker A: You know, like I was, I mean, you know, I don't like giving, I don't like, I don't like titles. I mean even in currently I don't have a title.
00:06:31.926 - 00:06:32.414, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:32.502 - 00:06:35.662, Speaker A: So I. So it's more like I call myself a cat, you know.
00:06:35.686 - 00:06:36.250, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:37.070 - 00:06:38.174, Speaker B: Chief of memes.
00:06:38.302 - 00:06:51.648, Speaker A: Yeah, no, ever. I think that's good. But I know I've actually always been extremely handsome, you know, like working through the. Working through every single communication, working through every single like ecosystem play, you know, working like forming the life for number WBTC.
00:06:51.744 - 00:06:52.096, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:52.168 - 00:07:03.328, Speaker A: WTC. WTC. Everyone knows WTC now, right. You know, but there's a. But the way it got started was extremely important, you know, to it becoming like the foundation.
00:07:03.384 - 00:07:03.528, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:03.544 - 00:07:06.592, Speaker A: To becoming the most trusted rep token today.
00:07:06.736 - 00:07:06.968, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:06.984 - 00:07:07.256, Speaker A: You know?
00:07:07.288 - 00:07:07.624, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:07.712 - 00:07:32.292, Speaker A: And the foundation was actually built out like so. Right, right. In the very early days of WTC, right. There was actually this really big license building. Got all the major dexters like compound and everyone the right partner go to come in everything. So, yeah, so I think doing so, you know, so, you know, I started the whole thing, right? Together with like Lloyd and couple others. So yeah, I think, you know, I think so.
00:07:32.292 - 00:07:50.830, Speaker A: I've always been really hands on, right. So it was more, it wasn't more like, so it wasn't more like building, but more like. But more like just actually the bigger decision, because I was always building stuff. The bigger decision was to come to Solana. So I would say that that was probably the bigger decision.
00:07:50.990 - 00:08:06.570, Speaker B: And what spurred that decision was it just kind of seeing Ethereum, like, you wanted to build a certain type of application that was not possible in Ethereum? Or was it just like, hey, I want to play around in the sandbox that is Solana and see what I can do?
00:08:06.870 - 00:08:43.450, Speaker A: I mean, it was probably a range of different factors, I would say. I would say at that point, I think I was getting a little bit tired of the constraints on EVM, where everything. We just started becoming less about what we can do in blockchain, but more like how we can save gas. We joke about it, but it's actually very true because if you go to the. And also, I think I was also kind of like becoming a little bit not unsure about the alto vision.
00:08:43.610 - 00:08:43.906, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:43.938 - 00:09:25.580, Speaker A: You know, I mean, I was, okay, altos are going to be great for like, you know, creating new, like cosmos, right? It's gonna be super easy to create new shit. No, I mean, I mean, I would say what I'm saying now is some hindsight, you know, but I had that kind of feeling back then, you know, that was like really becoming a certain, like, thing. I didn't really, I didn't really see, like, was going to be really great. So I think, and thirdly is that I was actually fairly intrigued by. So I think I also wanted to, I also wanted to go to a new community. I think that was actually a pretty big deal as well as, you know, communities get somewhat fossilized, right? I mean, I wouldn't say fossilized. The ethereum community is still very dynamic.
00:09:25.620 - 00:09:25.820, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:25.860 - 00:09:32.172, Speaker A: But certainly I think the shape of the community is formed, you know, whether it's bitcoin and everything.
00:09:32.236 - 00:09:32.436, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:32.468 - 00:10:07.836, Speaker A: You know? You know what I mean? So I think, and in crypto, the shape, I mean, it's really hard to understand if you're not in it, but when you're in it, you understand what I mean. There's a certain shape of the ecosystem of the community that it's like, you either like it or like it, right? Things like that. So I think for me, I kind of felt like the shape of the community wasn't really for me. So I think I wanted a fresh start as well, for sure. I think, yeah. So, in summary, it was partly the desire to explore new technology. Stack another thing is, I didn't really like where the direction is going around optimizing gas and output.
00:10:07.836 - 00:10:17.052, Speaker A: And lastly, I guess I wanted to kind of be part of a fresh ecosystem. Yeah. So I think those were the three. So those are three like ethereum specific reasons.
00:10:17.076 - 00:10:17.640, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:18.100 - 00:10:25.196, Speaker A: And then, and then, and then you had that. And then you have the Solana specific reasons as well, right. In the. So why Solana, right. And why not cosmos or Polkadot or anything, right. You know?
00:10:25.268 - 00:10:25.644, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:25.732 - 00:10:33.440, Speaker A: So I think. And over there, similarly, there are a few reasons as well, right. I think, first of all, I think I'm going to say the name that shall not be mentioned, you know.
00:10:34.890 - 00:10:35.346, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:35.418 - 00:10:43.946, Speaker A: I mean, I think, I think, I think, first of all, I think, I mean, I can, I can talk more. I can talk as much as I want about like, technology, everything, right. But market is really important.
00:10:44.018 - 00:10:44.250, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:44.290 - 00:10:55.178, Speaker A: You know, so I think so obviously, I think Sam and FTX drove a lot of the initial kind of like market and market like feasibility, viability.
00:10:55.274 - 00:10:55.914, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:56.082 - 00:11:10.342, Speaker A: Particularly around particular around serum. Serum was great. Serum was really great serum. I mean, even though when I first tried serum, I'm like, I'm like, this is like, this is like, obviously not quite there, right. Just completely unusable in so many ways.
00:11:10.446 - 00:11:10.902, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:11.006 - 00:11:23.990, Speaker A: But it was there. So in my view, I wasn't there. But the fundamentals of that, wow, you can actually build something like this, right? Because you can. The dream application that I won't be talking about viable on Ethereum, but you can do here.
00:11:24.110 - 00:12:06.130, Speaker B: Wanna kind of caught lightning in a bottle with, I mean, in 2020 and 2021, like, right after it launched, Ethereum almost became pretty much unusable because of the high gas fees, as you pointed out, like you're trying on the builder side to optimize for gas cost because they're so expensive. And then you have kind of this FTX Sam figure that comes in, like putting their entire weight behind the Solana ecosystem that help bring in or at least have new builders come and explore that ecosystem and then new possibilities that Solana brought about. It was a kind of magical moment that, I don't know, it's going to be very hard to replicate again for these other new ecosystems.
00:12:07.190 - 00:12:19.102, Speaker A: But you know what, that's funny. I mean, the risk of sidetracking a bit, I feel like magic in the moment happens. Like, I mean, bitcoin was landing the bottom right. It here was landing the bottle right. Now it's not even bothered.
00:12:19.126 - 00:12:19.262, Speaker C: Right?
00:12:19.286 - 00:12:47.650, Speaker A: So I think the really great thing about crypto right now is that, like, there's so many concurrent experiments happening right at the macro like capital and technical and requirement landscape, then lots of things happening as well. So I think it's like, you know, you don't really catch lightning at bottle, but if there are enough bottles and enough lightning, sometimes the lightning happens. And I have no doubt that as much as I love whatever is happening here, I have no doubt that there's going to be many more innovations to come.
00:12:47.770 - 00:12:48.830, Speaker B: 100%.
00:12:49.290 - 00:12:58.448, Speaker A: That's only number one. I think there was a certain proof of concept that this would be a feasible ecosystem.
00:12:58.554 - 00:12:58.964, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:59.052 - 00:13:14.756, Speaker A: And then, and then we started diving in a bit deeper as well, and we were impressed because it was like, um, because I'm not sure you remember, but, uh, most other chains, like Avax avex or like a cosmos, um, or not cosmos, like, um, the, um, that most of them went on EVM direction.
00:13:14.868 - 00:13:15.308, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:15.404 - 00:13:15.756, Speaker A: You know?
00:13:15.788 - 00:13:16.100, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:16.180 - 00:13:18.844, Speaker A: I think. And all the multiple blockchain direction.
00:13:18.932 - 00:13:19.180, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:19.220 - 00:13:19.460, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:19.500 - 00:13:49.646, Speaker A: So that was the only one that went like, I mean, I'm sure there are others, but Swanna was definitely the one that went, okay, we're going to have our own stack, own stack, own use cases. And the whole account model of building stuff was completely different. It was actually really horrendous to look at because you do, like, when you first started building, it was like, wow, you have to match the bytes and everything. And so it's just crazy. But I think. But it impressed us, right. Because, all right, this is a new, we could see how this fundamentally new way of building could lead to kind of fundamentally new applications.
00:13:49.798 - 00:13:50.182, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:50.246 - 00:13:51.998, Speaker A: You know, so that, so that's interesting for us.
00:13:52.014 - 00:13:52.570, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:53.410 - 00:14:04.746, Speaker A: And then lastly, I think we were able to get a bunch of our friends who were also interested in exploring this new ecosystem to do it as well. So we started exploring this direction.
00:14:04.938 - 00:14:19.698, Speaker B: That's amazing. Ultimately, you decided to venture out of the EVM ecosystem for a variety of reasons. What was the first project that you ultimately got your feet wet from the hands on building and building.
00:14:19.754 - 00:14:38.236, Speaker A: The team aspect I saw in Solana. Yes. Cool. Awesome. So I think, again, something real quick is that I think before ethereum, I was already working on a different things. So I think I do tend to actually explore quite a bit. Anyway, so I think it was a project called mercurial.
00:14:38.236 - 00:14:57.722, Speaker A: So mercurial. Like many other projects, we funded FTX in the era, and then we did an FTX IEo. Yeah. So, and, yeah, so I would say that that was actually. And then we. Yeah, and then we wanted the first amms in the space. Yeah.
00:14:57.722 - 00:15:04.826, Speaker A: So I think that was actually kind of like how we. And that's actually where the team formed and stuff. So that was actually the first thing that we did in Sona in the.
00:15:04.898 - 00:15:10.418, Speaker B: AMm space that that was also very competitive in the early days. Can you talk about that?
00:15:10.554 - 00:15:50.530, Speaker A: Sure, sure. It was actually extremely interesting how they say this. So, I mean, it was the days where nothing mattered. Accept tokens and lm and how much tvl you had, how much bus you gathered. Right, so, so that was, uh. So that was that, uh, and obviously, um, you had radium. Like, radium was there, uh, oca was there, sabo was there, um, atrius was there.
00:15:50.530 - 00:15:52.874, Speaker A: And there are many, many, many others, actually, many, many, many others.
00:15:52.922 - 00:15:53.058, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:53.074 - 00:16:40.302, Speaker A: You know, and then, uh. But much respect to, like, I really, really deep respect for like, like, radio Malka, you know, because I think they were the two projects that are, like, still doing really, really well now, you know, I'm saying. Right, yeah. And I, um. Yeah, so, so I think, um, obviously, I think for mercure, our initial project was stablecoins. So obviously our main, and I'm not sure if you remember, but our main, I would say competitor, but the other project that was doing stablecoins was sabre. And then they were able to generate massive amounts of liquidity mining and also through a variety of mechanisms and, but honestly, I think I don't, I think I've.
00:16:40.302 - 00:16:59.810, Speaker A: I know a lot of things happened since then, but I actually have massive amounts of respect, you know, for what he was able to do, you know, like that the team was able to do, you know, even though things didn't work out so well at the moment, you know, in a bit. But anyway, but with regards to us, I think we actually got caught. We were caught up in our game, liquidity money game.
00:17:00.470 - 00:17:05.736, Speaker B: I mean, that was the name of the game at the time. I mean, compound kicked it off. Everybody was doing it.
00:17:05.838 - 00:17:22.476, Speaker A: Yeah, but it was brutal. Holy shit. When your competitor was like, doing 2000% API, right? I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. I mean, I never said this before and stuff, because most interviews I've been on have been just talking about other stuff in general, right. But since I fuck it, I just say stuff.
00:17:22.508 - 00:17:23.156, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:23.348 - 00:17:43.386, Speaker A: I mean, that sounds brutal, man. I mean, when you're, when your main competitor was like, when you're, when someone was doing like 2000, like 20,000% Apye. Holy shit. Like, dude, that was, it was crazy because you had to keep up a certain level, keep up something like percent if you I to kind of like, to kind of like, keep up, right. Otherwise you died.
00:17:43.418 - 00:17:43.778, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:43.874 - 00:17:48.970, Speaker A: But, but, but on the other hand, when you. The more l you give, right. Then the more your token dies.
00:17:49.010 - 00:17:49.378, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:49.474 - 00:18:01.734, Speaker A: And the more to con dice and stuff, they just, then we just go, we just got caught in this, obviously the market back then was like dying, unless you were. So it was getting less hot already. Right. It wasn't like a few months ago, it just popping.
00:18:01.862 - 00:18:02.150, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:02.190 - 00:18:02.462, Speaker A: You know?
00:18:02.486 - 00:18:02.622, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:02.646 - 00:18:15.806, Speaker A: So I think. And also the token just got off to a back start because we launched, the token launched when the Mer token launched. When the China launch of FTX. When the China news landed, right. They started banning crypto.
00:18:15.838 - 00:18:16.006, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:16.038 - 00:18:22.278, Speaker A: So it was like, so in some sense, in some sense, instead of catching the market, we caught the knife.
00:18:22.454 - 00:18:22.814, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:22.862 - 00:18:25.462, Speaker A: You know, we call it knife is 20 wage.
00:18:25.486 - 00:18:26.060, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:26.230 - 00:18:29.896, Speaker A: Actually. But that actually, of course taught me a big lesson.
00:18:29.928 - 00:18:30.048, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:30.064 - 00:18:30.336, Speaker A: You know?
00:18:30.368 - 00:18:30.940, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:31.800 - 00:19:03.128, Speaker A: But yeah, I think for that project, it was for mercure. I think it started off, it started off in a sense that, number one, I think when the token launched, we caught knife. Right. Or the market dumped. And then later on, and later on as it got started, there was one big problem, right. It was that like, even though there were a lot of people who knew about mercurial, but they were not actually on chain users, they were FTX. Because when you do an FTX, Ieo, your initial community is not going to be your users.
00:19:03.184 - 00:19:03.780, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:04.320 - 00:19:08.780, Speaker B: That's true. You tap into an entire new community of traders.
00:19:09.520 - 00:19:21.656, Speaker A: Yeah. But then they are not users. They don't actually care. They don't actually care anything about you. They don't care about you. They use your product, they don't know who you are. They don't even use, I'm telling you, very, very, very few users in FTS actually use one.
00:19:21.688 - 00:19:22.260, Speaker C: Ah.
00:19:22.570 - 00:19:53.572, Speaker A: Anything and things like that. And most of their assets are on chain, so they really care. So the first problem was that instead of catching the market caught knife, the second thing is that this breakdown between your two side users, traders and users. So you can do a lot of stuff for the users, but they don't care. Let's care about the price. So then there's this big disconnect. And the third thing, and the third thing and the things that the game, the nail the game back then was lm.
00:19:53.676 - 00:19:54.036, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:54.108 - 00:19:56.276, Speaker A: You know? And then that game was fucking brutal.
00:19:56.348 - 00:19:56.748, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:56.844 - 00:20:12.756, Speaker A: So I think, I think, I think all, I think all three. I think, I think all three things created a I think, I think all three things, I think all three things created a extremely. And because then also back then there was no jupiter, right? So, so users will go to wherever the, the most he was.
00:20:12.868 - 00:20:13.188, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:13.244 - 00:20:13.452, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:13.476 - 00:20:19.742, Speaker A: You know, so they were just, um, you know, so we were like, no one was using mercury even for trading.
00:20:19.886 - 00:20:20.190, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:20.230 - 00:20:21.174, Speaker A: So there's no volume.
00:20:21.302 - 00:20:21.734, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:21.822 - 00:20:29.006, Speaker A: You know, so it's like. So it was like, uh. So it was like, uh, I would say it was like a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang kind of thing.
00:20:29.118 - 00:20:29.390, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:29.430 - 00:20:32.646, Speaker A: And then, uh, it was like. It was Buddha. Yeah, that was Buddha. Yeah.
00:20:32.678 - 00:20:55.330, Speaker B: So ultimately, I mean, a lot of learning lessons from your curl, it's still going on, still team working on it, driving that product forward. But you also decided to start a new project with Jupiter. Can you talk about the idea behind Jupiter and deciding to start that?
00:20:56.230 - 00:21:25.278, Speaker A: Sure. So I think two things. Right. I think, first of all, I think for. Anyway, just want to share something here real quick, is that actually at some point, I think some point last year, actually, so we never stopped working on mercurial. Jupiter was doing really, even though Jupiter started doing really, really well, but we actually never stopped working on mercurial. We continue working on mercurial.
00:21:25.278 - 00:22:04.486, Speaker A: We actually developed a lot of really innovative systems for it. And then earlier this year, we translated the platform and both the platform and the token to a completely new project called Metora. We have been making a lot of really good progress on Metora, and we have a really big launch. We're going to launch both something we call a dynamic liquidity market maker that combines the best of CRM and dynamic fees and also a new Dao and also a really powerful stimulus package. We call it. All that is going to come across live at the time of recording, you know.
00:22:04.518 - 00:22:04.686, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:04.718 - 00:22:06.974, Speaker A: So we have actually been working really, really hard.
00:22:07.022 - 00:22:07.206, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:07.238 - 00:22:09.398, Speaker A: You know, on, on the original thing as well.
00:22:09.494 - 00:22:09.798, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:09.854 - 00:22:11.430, Speaker A: You know, never, never gave up.
00:22:11.550 - 00:22:26.454, Speaker B: That makes sense. It's. It is hard. I mean, all startups are kind of like your children. You can't really kill them, and you want to make sure that you do everything in your power to survive and not only survive, but thrive and do really well. Yeah.
00:22:26.622 - 00:22:34.154, Speaker A: No, no, no, I don't. I don't survive. I win, you know? Right. No, no, no. Surviving for. No, no, surviving is for, um, you know, surviving for.
00:22:34.342 - 00:22:50.950, Speaker B: And I think that to that point, I mean, you've done a fabulous job, I mean, especially on kind of the Jupiter side, being able to iterate. And I think that is really like the team's superpower, whether it's been mercurial initially or even with Jupiter. Yeah, yeah.
00:22:51.850 - 00:22:54.434, Speaker A: So do. Sorry, go ahead.
00:22:54.562 - 00:23:26.166, Speaker B: Sorry. I guess just to pivot a little bit from like the backstory and like how you got into the ecosystem, Jupiter has been killing it. I think whenever I talk now with people that are just coming into the Solana ecosystem, they're like, oh, have you used Jupiter? It's an amazing product and it's kind of the go to app. So can you talk about just starting Jupyter the thought process there and ultimately kind of bringing us to modern day cool.
00:23:26.198 - 00:23:29.182, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Sorry if I was a bit passionate earlier.
00:23:29.326 - 00:23:30.686, Speaker B: No, no, it's all good.
00:23:30.798 - 00:23:35.874, Speaker A: I love the passion. Know that part of what we are doing, I think it's very important to understand that as well.
00:23:35.922 - 00:23:36.730, Speaker B: 100%.
00:23:36.850 - 00:23:45.226, Speaker A: But I think, remember how I said earlier about how like, you weren't getting volume, right, you were getting volume because everyone's using that.
00:23:45.258 - 00:23:45.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:45.778 - 00:23:57.690, Speaker A: And then, but so even though, so even though mercury didn't do very well, but we were actually building up a lot of like very good expertise, you know, about, around like how things work, you know, in how things work and so on.
00:23:57.730 - 00:23:57.930, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:57.970 - 00:24:15.108, Speaker A: So I think we. Okay, so let me, let me share the origination story of Jupiter in three points. Okay. The first point was that, like, okay, we needed a product that could give me a kill volume. That was very important.
00:24:15.204 - 00:24:15.436, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:15.468 - 00:24:29.662, Speaker A: Because if, because if basically, basically, if you didn't have some, basically, if you are not one of the top mms and you don't actually have users using you, you're dead. First off, dead in the water. Done.
00:24:29.766 - 00:24:30.174, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:30.262 - 00:24:33.862, Speaker A: So we needed something that could actually bring volume to mercury.
00:24:33.966 - 00:24:34.278, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:34.334 - 00:24:43.886, Speaker A: You know, that's actually one big. One. Big. And also there was starting to have more and more tokens as well in space, including all the rep tokens.
00:24:43.958 - 00:24:44.142, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:44.166 - 00:24:55.326, Speaker A: They're starting to come in. And back then. Back then there wasn't. Back then it was a very messy thing because it was still rep tokens over and everything just, it was. And there was that. So I think we wanted to also, obviously saw a need.
00:24:55.358 - 00:24:55.502, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:55.526 - 00:24:55.902, Speaker A: For it.
00:24:55.966 - 00:24:56.358, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:56.454 - 00:25:14.334, Speaker A: As well. Okay. So that's the first reason we wanted something that could actually kind of like make some of the tokens that we wanted to make mercurial get volume. We wanted to kind of like give some of the tokens that PI PI coins, like make them more useful.
00:25:14.422 - 00:25:14.622, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:14.646 - 00:25:16.790, Speaker A: So that's actually in mercurial more useful. So that's the first result.
00:25:16.830 - 00:25:17.222, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:17.326 - 00:25:41.030, Speaker A: The second reason is strategic. It's like strategic, right. It's to, if you look at the, basically, if you look at the landscape, if you look at the landscape, because remember I came for ethereum, right? So I understood the ethereum, so I understood defi game really, really well. You kind of understood three things that users care about. Three things. And they care about three things normally. They care about price, they care about having people get the token they want.
00:25:41.030 - 00:26:45.580, Speaker A: Third things that they care about how easy to use trading done, not anything else matter in defi. Let me say again, price token selection and usability, those three things done, right? So I think that was, I think so I, so I understood again. And then, and the reason why aggregators don't work well on Ethereum is gas, right? It's gas cost, right? It's like because, you know, and so it's like unless you're trading 100,000 or something, right? You know, then, then you always, there's no point that then the gas becomes too high for you to do it. Aggregator. And secondly, also because uniswap is so dominant over there, so we tend to have a lot of critical mass over there, whereas in solar it's multiplied out. I think I just understood what users in defi all want and combine that with certain key differences, I know they are different. So that gave me quite a lot of confidence in starting Jupiter.
00:26:45.580 - 00:27:44.386, Speaker A: So the second reason, third reason is that, and the third reason is internal. And this kind of goes into your very, very early statement about team test line, the team and stuff, right? Is that I think I knew that we have a great team. I knew that I worked with enough, I worked with enough people and enough and enough in different contexts. Such I have a very, very good sense of what a good team is and what a good team is. But for example, if you put a swimming, but for example, if you put for, if you put, if you put a team of, if you put a team of say, bodybuilders, right? And you ask them to go and go go marathon running, they'll suck, right? You know, there are all these muscle guys and they go to run marathon, they'll suck, right? So I felt a bit that way. Oh, wow. I have a team of really fucking great power lifters here.
00:27:44.386 - 00:28:19.880, Speaker A: But they're fucking running marathons, I'm saying, right? Okay, this doesn't really work. I'm single. So I thought, okay, cool. All right, great. So how, what kind of product will suit my team, right? Okay, number one, okay, a team that, number one, it will be a product that have a high touch, right? Where usability really matters, right? Because if you're LP, if I say if you're LP ing, then usability matters a bit less because you don't touch that product that often, you know, I'm saying, all right. And also, and also because, yeah, but if you do. But if you're doing a very high touching, like, swap, you can do it very often, right? That touch, checking the price and everything.
00:28:19.880 - 00:29:09.012, Speaker A: Very often. I think we had a team that was extremely focused on ux, and we spent a lot of time making the mercurial. I mean, the mercure is great. I think anyone who used the mercurial UX would say it was great, but no one cared because it just wasn't a product where you were expected that much since no one changed the molecule to swap. That's one thing. I think another thing is that I also realized that we were starting to gain an extremely good sense of the in and outs, right? For example, even at mercurial, we were the first to solve like some really big problems around, like compute units, around, like how do we, like, you know, take the incredibly complicated, like how they optimize the hell of the son of constraints, right? So we already kind of. And then also we started digging a lot into like the serum, right? And realized that, wow, no one else understands serum except us and the serum guys, obviously, you know.
00:29:09.036 - 00:29:09.244, Speaker C: Right.
00:29:09.292 - 00:29:45.796, Speaker A: But no one else really understand serum, right? So I said, okay. So I was like, okay, wow, okay, great. So anyway, in summary, first of all, so in summary, I think so if you combine the practicalities of the fact that mercurial had no volume and we needed something to get volume for mercurial, first off, done over. And not just that it was impossible, we did actually ask around that no one was in, no one's gonna integrate. There was no aggregator that was anywhere near ready. It's just so difficult, right? And secondly, and secondly, that no one, and even they're not integrating us, they're gonna integrate. Oh fuck.
00:29:45.868 - 00:29:46.148, Speaker C: We are.
00:29:46.164 - 00:29:46.636, Speaker A: Fuck.
00:29:46.748 - 00:29:46.996, Speaker C: Right?
00:29:47.028 - 00:30:20.450, Speaker A: There's no way. We need to get volume. That's first. It, first of all, there's a very clear reason, survival reason, having to build something, right? The second reason is strategic reason, based on both the user need and also the environmental context of gas cost and everything. And thirdly is the team capability. I saw that this is probably the best thing to do based on what you know. So if you combine all three things, the survival reason, like the survival reason, the strategy reason, the team reason, it becomes pretty fucking clear.
00:30:20.450 - 00:30:20.962, Speaker A: Why do we.
00:30:20.986 - 00:30:55.400, Speaker B: Yeah, it is pretty remarkable. I think it kind of going back to the point that we were talking about earlier on the building side where you kind of just have to eat shit for a little bit of time to realize like, hey, how can I continue to make my product better? What do I need to iterate on? What learnings lessons have I built over time? And for you, I mean, especially coming from the ethereum ecosystem, realizing, hey, gas is way too expensive over here. You can't do the aggregator model just because gases gets crazy. But that is possible on Solana.
00:30:58.620 - 00:31:17.092, Speaker A: I mean, I know for a fact that one inch and like one inch and periswap and Kyber swap, they spend enormous amount of time, right, whatever, I guess. I mean, we all work different things, obviously, but I think we are very focused on usability, for example, 100%.
00:31:17.156 - 00:31:46.940, Speaker B: And I think now that usability aspect is really what has brought Jupiter to the front and center, I would say, of the Solana ecosystem. As you mentioned, people love trading, people love their tokens. And by being able to aggregate kind of the best liquidity pools in that simple user experience, I mean, Jupiter at least, time and time again, when I talk with new individuals trying to explore the Solana ecosystem, they come to Jupiter.
00:31:47.560 - 00:31:51.660, Speaker A: So actually, I can talk a bit more. I can talk a bit more about that.
00:31:52.120 - 00:31:53.072, Speaker B: Go for it.
00:31:53.216 - 00:32:24.656, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. The important thing to understand is that usability in DeFi is not about ux. For example, say I build alarm, say, for example, if I'm building alarm clock application, it's a singular, it's a very singular, isolated me and the device interaction model. So usability can be defined as, okay, what the button say? The one thing I want to share here is that I'm sure this is really, this is really fun because I haven't talked about these things ever, you know? Right.
00:32:24.768 - 00:32:26.856, Speaker B: That's why I like the long form podcast.
00:32:27.048 - 00:32:57.706, Speaker A: Okay, this is fun. All right, cool. Okay. But usability is very different, is extremely different from, it's the polar opposite of like this model I was describing earlier, because like, things fail, endless things fail. For example, you have very different kind of liquidity models, right? You have serum and security model. You have like the good stock emm, you have sanctum, you have the regular emms, crmms and everything, right? So I think. And they fail.
00:32:57.706 - 00:33:16.422, Speaker A: They fail very often. And things break. The liquidity pulls are sometimes too small, but users want to trade it, right? And just endless number of things. Like, for example, if a CBC is too, your stippage is too low, things always fail. Your cpu is too high, you get wrecked, right. You know?
00:33:16.446 - 00:33:16.702, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:16.766 - 00:33:26.766, Speaker A: Like for example, there was this case on Ethereum previously that one guy lost. One guy lost $2 million doing a trade you know, because the cpu wasn't set properly.
00:33:26.798 - 00:33:27.086, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:27.158 - 00:33:35.028, Speaker A: You know, so the MeV just took everything. So I think there are a lot of things that go into. There are things that obsess over, you know.
00:33:35.084 - 00:33:35.588, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:35.724 - 00:33:43.596, Speaker A: And also, for example, like how fast do we, like how fast do the, like how fast do the, how fast do the cash run? Because Solana runs really fucking fast.
00:33:43.628 - 00:33:44.036, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:44.148 - 00:33:59.372, Speaker A: So it's the blockchain of 400 seconds, right. So think about in Ethereum, blockchain is 14 seconds, right. So after blockchain, she has entire 14 seconds to generate the code. It was fine. You don't have the luxury, right. They're both over, you know.
00:33:59.396 - 00:33:59.532, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:59.556 - 00:34:33.002, Speaker A: So you have to, you have to keep your backend and your back end has to run all the faster servers and your routing has to be super fucking fast. And there's a lot of things that go into that process and I'm saying, all right, so, yeah, so I just want to share that. Like, when we talk about usability, we don't just mean, I think a lot of people just talk about the UI, right. But I think it's an entire stack, right. And I'm saying, of a really, really deep understanding of how the entire stack works, you know. Right. That I think is good for us.
00:34:33.002 - 00:34:35.190, Speaker A: I think we are relentless about that.
00:34:36.330 - 00:35:20.800, Speaker B: Do you think ultimately that comes back to kind of that relentless shipping, just being able to iterate and find out what works, what doesn't work. A lot of that early experimentations and learnings got to be applied to Jupiter and seeing how to actually make the best product because I. And going back to earlier, these things don't happen overnight. Jupiter was not an overnight success. It has slowly, continually grinded. And now I think to your point earlier, things seem to go up in crypto relatively quickly, but that was never the case. The team grinds on the back end and continuously shifts quite a bit, actually.
00:35:22.180 - 00:35:36.804, Speaker A: It's a really, really good point because actually if you look at the Jupyter usage, right, it never popped. It never. It never popped. There was never that popped. You know, the only thing only that popped recently was like after breakpoint, people started like carrying about Jupiter and Solana more. That's the pops, you know. Right.
00:35:36.804 - 00:35:39.524, Speaker A: But in general, and Jupyter happens to receive a lot of attention.
00:35:39.652 - 00:35:39.892, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:39.916 - 00:35:42.292, Speaker A: You know? Right, but you know, everything has popped too.
00:35:42.316 - 00:35:42.956, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:43.148 - 00:36:18.744, Speaker A: So. But, yeah, but it has been, it has been very consistent. Like, we just consistently kind of like just became better along a range of metrics and adding, I would say that we have been pretty good at adding the right count features, I think, like DCA, we added that a few months ago. We're actually very proud of the feature because it's a feature that a lot of people want. It's actually super useful, but it actually hasn't been done well anywhere before. I don't know of our reason, but we were the first to really know the experience, I think. So.
00:36:18.744 - 00:36:27.724, Speaker A: I think people really love that, you know? Yeah. And also, I think also we also launched a bridge competitor, allowing you to compete different rates to come in to sauna.
00:36:27.812 - 00:36:28.036, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:28.068 - 00:36:35.804, Speaker A: So you can compare like, you know, between different bridges. And then we also started on that like a few months ago, you know, and now it's useful.
00:36:35.852 - 00:36:36.036, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:36.068 - 00:36:38.204, Speaker A: You know, because we started a few months ago, you know.
00:36:38.332 - 00:36:38.548, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:38.564 - 00:36:55.290, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think. Yeah, so I think a lot of things have just been a matter of like, I guess both. I mean, you had the fundamentals, right. The fundamentals are like your basics, you know, you can't fuck those up, you know? Okay, this is what I tell people.
00:36:55.330 - 00:36:55.482, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:55.506 - 00:37:20.012, Speaker A: So, so in internally, I just got you promise, right? Best price, best to go, best, right. I always say this, right. It's like you can, you can fuck up many things, right? You can maybe you can do, you can launch, but that one cast, you know, you can maybe, you know, you can like, you know, do something stupid, whatever. But then if you always have that promise, right, then you always have a role in the ecosystem, you know?
00:37:20.036 - 00:37:20.172, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:20.196 - 00:37:27.320, Speaker A: So I think so to answer to kind of share a bit more on that. It is a combination of having a very strong call.
00:37:27.620 - 00:37:27.932, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:27.956 - 00:37:29.796, Speaker A: You know, a call. Okay. Of the promise.
00:37:29.828 - 00:37:29.948, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:29.964 - 00:37:48.680, Speaker A: You know, but also kind of iterating and trying new features, right. So I think what happens a lot, very often in crypto, I notice, is that people try things because someone else do it or because some users say or whatever, but then they lose a call. Right. And they just become, then they don't know what they stand for anymore.
00:37:48.760 - 00:37:49.024, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:49.072 - 00:38:17.996, Speaker B: And that's a great point. I've actually seen a lot of teams this happen too, as well. They forget their core product. That kind of got them from zero to one and get excited, as many of us do within the blockchain industry, about the shiny new thing. There's a bunch of different features that they want to add or new ecosystems that they want to start playing in and forget their core product and ultimately start to lose market share. But that is definitely not been the case in the Jupiter standpoint.
00:38:18.148 - 00:38:37.932, Speaker A: So actually it's a really, really interesting point that you are bringing up about the whole ecosystem thing because the tourism, the first thing is the product call. And then. But in crypto, it's never a product, right. Again, going back to the alarm crop, right. You know, if you are building alarm clock, then. Yeah. It's what it's about the alarm crop and single.
00:38:37.956 - 00:38:38.380, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:38.500 - 00:38:57.644, Speaker A: But then crypto is not. Crypto is this incredibly complicated. So it's complicated like of like community. Like community cosystem, finance and product, right. All three matter. You know, I don't. I don't care whether meme coin or your jupyter or your blockchain, right.
00:38:57.644 - 00:39:10.092, Speaker A: Product matter, right? If your meme. If you're a meme coin, your product is device, you know? Because I love meme coins, okay? I fucking love meme coins. Okay? To anyone who do not mean coins, I say, guys, shoot the fuck out. Have some fun, you know?
00:39:10.116 - 00:39:10.372, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:10.436 - 00:39:13.788, Speaker A: I mean, I bring a product, my product and everything, but I love meme coins, right? I love bong.
00:39:13.844 - 00:39:15.572, Speaker B: Gotta got enjoy the vibes.
00:39:15.716 - 00:39:40.336, Speaker A: Yeah. So, so, but whatever it is, right. You have the product, you have. You have the product, you have the community and then you have the financial part of it, right. It's like really dynamic things or treatings, right? And so I think in all these three things, right, whether it's in terms of product or whether in terms of community or whether it's in terms of the financial side things, right. You are never call. A call is really, really important, right.
00:39:40.336 - 00:39:42.000, Speaker A: So the danger.
00:39:42.040 - 00:39:42.384, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:42.472 - 00:39:53.830, Speaker A: The. So people. So one. And you see that happening very often, right, in crypto is that they go that, okay. Especially EVM, right? Okay, okay. I have. I have.
00:39:53.830 - 00:39:57.370, Speaker A: I have an EVM code base, right. Why don't I just deploy somewhere else, you know?
00:39:57.410 - 00:39:57.946, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:58.098 - 00:40:03.906, Speaker A: And then they do that, right? But then evm. But then the commute, the community doesn't move along with you.
00:40:04.018 - 00:40:04.410, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:04.490 - 00:40:20.070, Speaker A: You know, the good thing about EVM is that, like. But that. It's not that. The good thing about EVM is that, like, I mean, there are many, many autos, but they automate kind of similar communities. They jump around a lot, right? But if you're on Solana, right. Your community is. And then if you.
00:40:20.070 - 00:40:55.900, Speaker A: If. I mean, if you go to, like, appdos or sui, right, or like. No, get wrong. Go there if you want to, it's no big deal, right? But you don't. Your camp, your community doesn't follow you, you know? In fact, your community hates you now, you know, right. I mean, for good, for bad, they hate you now, right? Because you're like, okay, I mean, and you make for number. For example, there was some NXT projects that left to somewhere else, right? Dude, those guys put their community in a really weird place that, okay, I'm part of the NFT thing, but I also like this thing and you're making it really awkward for me right now.
00:40:55.900 - 00:40:57.040, Speaker A: I'm not supposed to show.
00:40:57.500 - 00:41:25.360, Speaker B: It is, it is strange because, I mean, I feel like this is only within crypto and it, maybe it's just the token or money aspect that goes along with it. Well, because, for example, if you like, compared blockchains to like cloud providers and was like, hey, I'm going from AWS to Google Cloud, no one's going to give a shit. They're like, whatever. Like, but now you attach a token to it and you're like, you're abandoning my token. How dare you? I'm going to fud your project.
00:41:26.260 - 00:41:54.472, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a bit, I think it's a, I think to your point, to be fair though, I think it's a little bit more than money aspect to it. I really think that people have feelings, you know? Right. I think it's more like, I think it's more like you're really in. I feel like it's actually more like, for example, what's a good example here? Maybe like you maybe really love Taylor Swift or something, right. You know, boyfriend. So say fuck the boyfriend kind of thing, you know?
00:41:54.496 - 00:41:54.632, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:54.656 - 00:42:05.440, Speaker A: Kind of thing. I actually feel like it's actually more that way, you know, the money thing matters as well. But I feel like, like, I mean, I feel like blockchains have such a strong, like emotional thing to it.
00:42:05.600 - 00:42:05.920, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:05.960 - 00:42:21.426, Speaker A: You know that I think that's very right. And I think. I'm sorry, but just like how the product call. Product call. I think we also have a very strong community call. We are actually very simple here, I think. So what we do a lot.
00:42:21.426 - 00:43:02.780, Speaker A: What we do a lot, if I saw, is that we really work extremely hard to add value to part of the broader ecosystem. Both crypto, I think for Solana, for example, I think we work extremely hard on APIs and SDKs. I think that's the reason why. I think that's the reason why I think we are the most integrated platform in sauna because it's not for free. We have already. Every time there's any problems with anything, we take care of it. The other thing that we do a lot of is that I think we also work really, really hard with new emms.
00:43:02.780 - 00:43:40.204, Speaker A: So I think the thing that people don't quite see, but I'm personally very proud of, is that we work extremely hard on new emms. In fact, in months and months and months before they launch, we actually work with them to make sure that their stuff is good and solid, and then we launch it. And thirdly is, I think we're starting to get more because Jupyter is a pretty well used protocol. We do a lot of work in kind of making sure that the tokens that people use, the projects that people get involved with are actually legit.
00:43:40.252 - 00:43:40.840, Speaker C: Right.
00:43:41.340 - 00:44:03.440, Speaker A: And that's also why we recently announced Jupyter Start, which is like a five step thing to really help new, help introduce new communities, new projects or communities, because we really want to help the ecosystem grow. Right. So I think that's actually the other thing that, that's very different.
00:44:03.480 - 00:44:03.728, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:03.784 - 00:44:15.320, Speaker A: You don't just need a product core, you know, you also need a certain philosophy right. Around ecosystem. And you see Ethereum, that's the same for.
00:44:15.440 - 00:44:16.032, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:16.176 - 00:44:17.616, Speaker A: All the great Ethereum projects.
00:44:17.648 - 00:44:18.176, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:18.328 - 00:44:21.992, Speaker A: Have a certain, like, relationship, you know.
00:44:22.016 - 00:44:22.152, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:22.176 - 00:44:24.128, Speaker A: And I think that's actually like very fundamental.
00:44:24.264 - 00:44:39.116, Speaker B: Yeah. I think I've in the past have kind of historically underappreciated the community aspect and that dynamic. But it is very important. I think you guys have done it well. Madlads and Backpack has done it very well.
00:44:39.188 - 00:44:39.880, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:44:40.420 - 00:45:10.560, Speaker B: Where that community aspect is actually kind of turbocharges the product and the product usage. And it's really the combination of those two that really is the catalyst for extreme growth. And I think as much as Ethereum has some of its issues, the community aspect is one that they've absolutely nailed. Even on the roadmap side, everybody knows different EIP numbers. They can recite it like the Bible. They're very good at that aspect.
00:45:10.640 - 00:45:30.682, Speaker A: You're amazing. Amazing. I mean, I would say that like, I mean, yeah, totally amazing. Ethereum is like, like, I mean, every time I go to an Ethereum event, right, I am. I mean, it's like, I should say it's actually very. For someone, you know. Stanford, Stanford production Week.
00:45:30.786 - 00:45:31.426, Speaker B: Yep.
00:45:31.578 - 00:45:38.034, Speaker A: Stanford watching week is a very ethereum adjacent. I would call it Ethereum adjacent event.
00:45:38.162 - 00:45:43.186, Speaker B: I hope it changes a little bit. But I definitely agree. It's very modular slash ethereum focus.
00:45:43.378 - 00:46:14.736, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all about, I mean, there's some, there's some like side conversations about crush, about crushing everything and. But yeah, I think it's a, I mean, it's called Stanford boxing Week, but it should really be called like Stanford Ethereum week, you know, or something. Yeah, no, no, but it's fine. I don't really care to change, you know, there are just so many things. There's just so many good things come. There's just so many good things, you know, coming up, you know? But I think, uh, yeah, I think that when I go to a conference, I'm like, wow, it's interesting because you really have that, um. You really have that really strong core there, I think, you know.
00:46:14.736 - 00:46:19.840, Speaker A: Yeah. And also, um. And also, obviously you saw some pretty strong backers over there paradigm, you know.
00:46:19.880 - 00:46:20.460, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:20.880 - 00:46:30.472, Speaker A: As well. And then. Yeah. Who have been historically extremely connected to Ethereum. I'm not sure for good for that, you know, I think they're definitely extremely influential ethereum right now.
00:46:30.536 - 00:46:30.784, Speaker C: Right.
00:46:30.832 - 00:46:33.352, Speaker A: And I'm not 100% sure it's good for bad.
00:46:33.416 - 00:47:19.690, Speaker B: But in Hoshi, I do think longer term, I mean, it really is, in my opinion, kind of just a factor of number go up if it's really all these venture funds are betting on the fastest horse per se. At one time, that was bitcoin as the fastest growing asset. Then Ethereum expanded upon that with smart contracts. I think now going from Ethereum to high throughput blockchains like Solana that have scalability baked in. You don't have to worry about Gatsby. It will be a new paradigm and you will have, in my opinion, this capital repricing. If that does happen, then you'll see a lot of these kind of traditional players move over into the Solana and high throughput ecosystems.
00:47:19.690 - 00:47:26.490, Speaker B: And the people that I think were here initially are going to actually do extremely well.
00:47:26.910 - 00:48:09.972, Speaker A: I mean, to the point, right. I feel like, I feel like at least for Jupiter, right? I feel like the whole Ethereum ecosystem and defi system, as I said, let me just rewind 5 seconds. Okay, cool. All right, thanks. I feel like the whole crypto. I feel like the whole. I feel like there's a certain obsession, like TDL and everything stuff, you know? And also like, also like, also like, actually, I feel like the scope of our imagination now is limited, right? Because of what? Because of building.
00:48:09.972 - 00:48:13.356, Speaker A: Because, for example, if you're building on. Because before. Before ethereum or does bitcoin.
00:48:13.388 - 00:48:13.772, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:13.876 - 00:48:19.436, Speaker A: And if you're on bitcoin, then, then your, your imagination is ciphered because you can't do a lot of stuff, right?
00:48:19.468 - 00:48:19.916, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:20.028 - 00:48:25.708, Speaker A: And even when I try to do stuff, then you have coins and everything that's really good and really, really visionary.
00:48:25.764 - 00:48:25.908, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:25.924 - 00:48:28.612, Speaker A: But then it was so hard to do, right. Then people just gave up.
00:48:28.636 - 00:48:28.916, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:28.988 - 00:48:37.076, Speaker A: Okay, fine. Bitcoin store value done, next, right it here, same thing to it. So it should really open up possibility, right. For many, many days.
00:48:37.108 - 00:48:37.252, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:37.276 - 00:48:45.642, Speaker A: I. But as things become so difficult, like consumer action so difficult, payments can so difficult, remittance becomes so difficult.
00:48:45.706 - 00:48:45.954, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:46.002 - 00:49:11.926, Speaker A: You know, getting more users to use stuff, right? And then you start and you start creating outputs thing, which is great, but, you know, honestly, no result here, no real result. It's hard enough for them to use blockchains, let alone, you know, like 20 outputs, right. So I think as a result that you start, you stop imagining, right. It's just that when the bitcoin, in the bitcoin world, they stop imagining things, right. Because things are so difficult to do, right. Same thing. Ethereum, I think they're stopped imagining.
00:49:11.926 - 00:49:41.318, Speaker A: Seriously, ethereum, my biggest issue right now is that they're stopped imagining. They just go, okay, the world is gonna made up of these crazy XL tools and TVL. And then all we need to do is to just create more l, two s and more coins and we're good. And then they come with all kinds of reasons for why you're able to execute like asynchronously across blockchain altos. That will not happen. It wouldn't happen. I've done a lot of caution stuff.
00:49:41.318 - 00:49:59.102, Speaker A: It would not happen. So I think as a result, I think we have stopped imagining. I think over here is where I think part of my mission in the coming year or so is to really start getting people imagined more. Cool. We don't have to be at the same constraint anymore, you know?
00:49:59.126 - 00:49:59.334, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:59.382 - 00:50:21.502, Speaker A: We can imagine what things can look like, you know, we can actually imagine. We can actually imagine making payments work. We can imagine trying to make remittances work again. You know, we should be trying to imagine like making social work, right. I think so. I feel that is going to be a very pivotal point, but that's going to happen as well. But obviously we need people to use those things, right.
00:50:21.502 - 00:50:27.902, Speaker A: That's actually why getting enough people into the Solana ecosystem first, so that this thing can get attraction so important.
00:50:28.006 - 00:50:28.318, Speaker C: Right?
00:50:28.374 - 00:50:50.084, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think that. So I think it's a multi step process, right? I think the first step process is imagined. Seriously. I think, I think personally, I think personally, I think I recently wrote a post recently and going like, okay, people expect us to do a certain thing because, like, for example, when we first started, right, people are going to, oh, you're going to deploy on app dollars and suite, and that's going to have a button on the site to change the wallet.
00:50:50.132 - 00:50:50.580, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:50.700 - 00:50:53.640, Speaker A: That is what they said. That's what they expect us to do.
00:50:53.980 - 00:50:54.460, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:54.540 - 00:51:13.166, Speaker A: You know what we say? Fuck it, right? Oh, we're going to. We're going to do that. We're going to. Instead of like spreading out, we're going to add value. We got deep value in the product, add deep value to the ecosystem and add deep value to the users. Have this relationship with the users. I think similarly, I think it's going to be a three step process.
00:51:13.166 - 00:51:35.328, Speaker A: I think the first step process is for us to have more confidence. We are on a new game, new platform, new possibilities. Let's go. We don't have to think that we are not as good or something. That's firstly, the second thing is that I think we need to bring on a lot more users. A lot more. And there's no reason, again, when your guess is like $5, right.
00:51:35.328 - 00:51:59.534, Speaker A: The number of people who use you are limited for stock. And if you have to navigate between 20 different chains to do something, to find something, your user base is going to be smaller as well. But we don't have those concerns here. So you should really be thinking how do we bring on way, way, way more users? How do we get all the sex users in? How do we get everyone in? I think that's certainly one of my main goals. Right. In the next year.
00:51:59.622 - 00:51:59.894, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:59.942 - 00:52:27.974, Speaker B: Meow. Send sign by side with you over the next couple of years or next decade and help champion this as well. Because I think at frictionless, I mean, these are the unique things that we're excited about. I think the analogy that I use is like going from dial up to broadband. Like, you can build YouTube type applications once you're on broadband. And I think Solana was that leap got you from dial up Internet to broadband. And I think that will only continue.
00:52:27.974 - 00:52:55.310, Speaker B: And so these zero to one type applications, I really think, I mean, Jupiter. And I think what you've been doing with the perp Dax, maybe it's a good segue into what you've been doing. There is a good reimagination of like, all right, now we have higher throughput blockchains. We can do more with it. What can we make? Can you talk a little bit about like, the Jupiter perp Dax and, I mean, you guys have gained a majority of market share relatively quickly.
00:52:55.970 - 00:53:12.346, Speaker A: I mean, it's too early, right. You know, I think we hit a billion, like a billion volume recently. You know, we, I mean, it has been a month and we launched in beta and also launched with a very, very highly capped, extremely capped, you know, aum.
00:53:12.498 - 00:53:12.810, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:12.850 - 00:53:35.434, Speaker A: You know. Yeah. So I think it's good. I think, I think we are probably very focused on like, say like how do we like make it such that you don't have to use a sex anymore.
00:53:35.482 - 00:53:36.002, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:36.146 - 00:54:11.978, Speaker A: And I actually believe in it deeply because the reason I believe in it very, very deeply is that I think it's not just because of Jupiter. I think when you are on, people always talk about how sectors have deeper liquidity, how sectors easier to use and all that kind of stuff, but it's actually that becomes less and less true by the day. Firstly, I think, for example, for example, we don't use the liquidity from Jupiter alone. We use the liquidity from the whole ecosystem.
00:54:12.104 - 00:54:12.686, Speaker C: All right.
00:54:12.798 - 00:54:43.426, Speaker A: Are we saying that, are we saying that the entire ecosystem over time cannot have more liquidity than binance over time? I don't think so. I think that has been there that we are going to have enough Dexs and everything and stuff and markets that we have better liquidity than binance at some point. Certainly better liquidity and more sectors already. Certainly for somebody you can already buy so an occasionally by BTC at a lower price than Coinbase, for example.
00:54:43.458 - 00:54:43.626, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:43.658 - 00:54:52.346, Speaker A: Things like that, you know? Yeah. So I think, I think so. I think that's actually one thing that we want to do. I want to make it such a cool. You don't have a reason to use some else.
00:54:52.378 - 00:54:52.882, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:53.026 - 00:55:10.518, Speaker A: And then the second thing is that when the user is actually on, like on, on the user funds, right. Are on a wallet, right. On the central wallet, she can use anything he wants. He can use Camino, he can use soling, he can use a primitive and payments everything.
00:55:10.574 - 00:55:11.006, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:11.118 - 00:55:12.734, Speaker A: All things are not possible somewhere else.
00:55:12.822 - 00:55:13.190, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:13.270 - 00:55:21.690, Speaker A: So we just need to keep on continuously growing the utility, right. Of having your capital, you know, on the blockchain, you know.
00:55:22.390 - 00:55:23.086, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:23.238 - 00:55:33.638, Speaker A: And the third thing, another thing, and another thing is obviously, to, another thing, obviously, is to kind of like blend everything in the Ui, right. You know, and kind of usability that they are very familiar with.
00:55:33.654 - 00:55:33.806, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:33.838 - 00:55:39.800, Speaker A: Which is why the purpose thing is important, right. You know, because it allows the user to kind of like get access to things that are very familiar with.
00:55:39.880 - 00:55:40.480, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:40.640 - 00:55:46.104, Speaker A: In a UI that, that. Sorry. In the UI they're familiar with, you know, but also. Wow, it's actually fun and easy.
00:55:46.152 - 00:55:46.360, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:46.400 - 00:55:53.200, Speaker A: It's true, you know. Yeah. So I think we are quite some ways along these three dimensions.
00:55:53.240 - 00:55:53.392, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:53.416 - 00:55:55.160, Speaker A: Along the dimension, as you can see. I love trees.
00:55:55.200 - 00:55:55.352, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:55.376 - 00:56:06.272, Speaker A: You know, like the first dimension of liquidity, we are early. The second dimension of usability, early. And the third dimension of utility, early as well.
00:56:06.336 - 00:56:06.728, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:06.824 - 00:56:19.256, Speaker A: But there's no reason. There's no reason that within the next two or three years, right. We will get to, I hope, near parity, you know. Right. And the next 510 years, you'll win, I think decentralized will win. You know, I do agree.
00:56:19.328 - 00:56:39.112, Speaker B: It's kind of like a one way door where once you go from kind of the traditional tradfi world to the crypto rails, you really don't come back. I mean, more and more younger individuals are storing their wealth on chain as that liquidity becomes larger.
00:56:39.296 - 00:56:55.772, Speaker A: And one thing real quick to what you were saying earlier is that actually my transition to the Defi world didn't really happen until Solana because doing perfs in Ethereum is painfully expensive.
00:56:55.836 - 00:56:56.036, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:56.068 - 00:56:58.876, Speaker A: And using socks, Ethereum is painfully expensive.
00:56:58.948 - 00:56:59.180, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:59.220 - 00:56:59.516, Speaker A: You know?
00:56:59.548 - 00:56:59.764, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:59.812 - 00:57:05.996, Speaker A: And as much as I hated, as much as I hated success, I'm like, okay, I have to, you know, I just want cheaper to just buy that.
00:57:06.028 - 00:57:06.600, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:07.620 - 00:57:08.380, Speaker A: It's much easier.
00:57:08.420 - 00:57:08.572, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:08.596 - 00:57:12.476, Speaker A: You know, I think, yeah, I think, yeah. So I think, I think about Solana. I don't feel it.
00:57:12.668 - 00:57:38.540, Speaker B: Same thing. I mean, for Solana and like, the high throughput blockchains, I mean, ultimately, it's kind of like everything and more is possible on a Solana type network than an ethereum or an l two. There's nothing not possible that is only possible on an ethereum of the world. Like, everything is more performant, cheaper, faster, easier on a Solana blockchain, which is ridiculous. Sure.
00:57:39.120 - 00:57:56.372, Speaker A: I love using Jupyter. I mean, I love it. I know. No, I'm not shooting it. I really like it every time I use it. Today I was just using it for range of things, liquidity. I was just typing zeros because I wanted to check the liquidity for BTC right now.
00:57:56.372 - 00:58:02.172, Speaker A: So I started, I opened up Twitter, I started typing 10 zero. It just, oh, it's great. I love it.
00:58:02.196 - 00:58:02.332, Speaker C: Right?
00:58:02.356 - 00:58:23.522, Speaker A: And then I solved for some. I did some swapping earlier. I placed a, I placed a pub earlier, I placed 100 x per year. I lost all my money really quick, you know, whatever. So I think I really enjoyed, I think. And also, it also felt good because I was, I wasn't using a sex, I was using a Dax, you know?
00:58:23.546 - 00:58:23.730, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:23.770 - 00:58:26.146, Speaker A: And then right afterwards, I was able to connect to Camino.
00:58:26.178 - 00:58:26.322, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:26.346 - 00:58:27.730, Speaker A: Do some stuff there, you know, saying no.
00:58:27.770 - 00:58:28.402, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:28.586 - 00:58:35.786, Speaker A: So I think that freedom of usage and freedom of like the freedom of usage and freedom of like choice.
00:58:35.858 - 00:58:36.042, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:36.066 - 00:58:40.018, Speaker A: You get, you know, like you use Jupiter, you're not stuck in Jupiter, you can use anything, one.
00:58:40.154 - 00:58:40.522, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:40.586 - 00:59:00.562, Speaker A: You know, I just feel like that. And then, so it places tremendous pressure on Jupiter to just be good, you know. Right, right. It's like, hey, you have no mode, right. Being good, being a good, like being a good product, good community and being a good ecosystem player. Those are your modes, right. It's a good mode to have.
00:59:00.562 - 00:59:08.470, Speaker A: If all of us, right. If all of us like focus on, if everyone, ecosystem focus on those modes, we are great. It's a great system done. Over.
00:59:09.210 - 00:59:38.440, Speaker B: I do agree in terms of maybe kind of wrapping up the podcast. Ultimately, I think that special combination, as you mentioned, of not only Jupyter but really every other DeFi program that you can really connect with happens because of the high throughput single shard architecture that Solana really pioneered. Can you talk about where you see the future of Solana Defi and even the future of Jupiter within that?
00:59:38.830 - 01:00:37.268, Speaker A: So I think one thing that I mentioned in my breakpoint talk, and I keep talking about it everywhere I go, is that the critical, really, really the critical thing to understand as we start to imagine in future is that the utility of Solana and the use X of Solana gets increases over time. Because again, it's one blockchain. It's one blockchain. I think most bystanders who talk about the speed and everything, but one thing and a more geeky term is compatibility. But you can just think of it as one blockchain because why? Because all the use cases, all the games, all the tokens, all the markets and all the NFTs are all in one blockchain. You can literally be on Jupyter at some point and search for something. We didn't search yet, but maybe we can search for something at some point and then get anything, one you'll be able to execute synchronously across anything you want, right.
01:00:37.268 - 01:00:39.524, Speaker A: Across any market, any asset.
01:00:39.612 - 01:00:40.196, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:40.348 - 01:00:43.124, Speaker B: That is the alpha. I don't think people fully appreciate it.
01:00:43.212 - 01:00:46.596, Speaker A: They don't fully appreciate that. And that's actually really important because that is what you do to us.
01:00:46.628 - 01:00:47.132, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:47.276 - 01:00:47.716, Speaker A: You know.
01:00:47.748 - 01:00:48.012, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:48.076 - 01:00:51.988, Speaker A: And you really, that future doesn't exist elsewhere.
01:00:52.124 - 01:00:52.708, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:52.844 - 01:01:03.184, Speaker A: The reason it doesn't exist on, on Ethereum, right. Is that you can't have that experience. It's not possible. I don't care what you say. I mean if you, if you understand blockchains, you understand you can't do it.
01:01:03.272 - 01:01:03.880, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:04.040 - 01:01:06.424, Speaker A: That's it. I'm not hating on altruism.
01:01:06.512 - 01:01:06.688, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:06.704 - 01:01:09.032, Speaker A: Anything even though. But just can't do it.
01:01:09.056 - 01:01:09.168, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:09.184 - 01:01:17.360, Speaker A: It's just I saying that, for example, an elephant heavy, you know, it's not, it's not saying anything with elephant, just elephant heavy.
01:01:17.400 - 01:01:17.816, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:17.928 - 01:01:20.540, Speaker B: We can love elephants and still acknowledge elephants.
01:01:21.120 - 01:01:23.776, Speaker A: You can love elephants and they're heavy, they can run it fast.
01:01:23.888 - 01:01:24.352, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:24.456 - 01:01:28.312, Speaker A: So similarly. Right. I feel like. But that's actually Alpha.
01:01:28.336 - 01:01:28.448, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:28.464 - 01:01:30.682, Speaker A: So I think. So that answers your questions, Jupyter.
01:01:30.746 - 01:01:31.378, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:31.554 - 01:01:59.650, Speaker A: We are not building towards the future. We are not being, we are not building a future where we care about. Where we care about, say what happens now. Obviously what happens now is that we fix bugs, any bugs, fix that shit. And also on the more intermediate terms there is like. But we are really going towards the future whereby there's going to be gazillion unlimited number of shit happening.
01:01:59.690 - 01:02:00.034, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:00.122 - 01:02:01.010, Speaker A: Some good, some bad.
01:02:01.090 - 01:02:01.498, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:01.594 - 01:02:07.730, Speaker A: And again, I think right now, I think Solana ecosystem looks kind of similar to Ethereum today.
01:02:07.890 - 01:02:08.162, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:08.186 - 01:02:09.090, Speaker A: In terms of the core functionality.
01:02:09.130 - 01:02:09.258, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:09.274 - 01:02:12.938, Speaker A: But we think what, we think it should look very different in the coming years.
01:02:12.994 - 01:02:13.186, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:13.218 - 01:02:21.650, Speaker A: And we want to, we think it should, we think can issue different, you know, so I think our goal is to do that. Yeah, I think. But of course, along the way there's a lot of things to fix.
01:02:21.690 - 01:02:21.866, Speaker C: Right.
01:02:21.898 - 01:03:02.996, Speaker A: For example, for example, for the post to work really well, we need to have an extremely good oracle system, extremely diabolical system. And that, and that kind of thing really cuts across like ux, the oracle itself, Solana itself, how everything's done, everything. But I think everything is improving at a very rapid pace. You know, I think one thing to just say that is that another thing I'm impressed by is that Solana works really hard to solve problems. So all the main problems that we had building on Solana two years ago around is now gone, which is amazing, you know, and it's a combat effort of the co system with amazing people that are money, obviously, you know. Right. And.
01:03:02.996 - 01:03:08.840, Speaker A: Yeah. And also the foundation itself. So it's pretty amazing. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So I think that is what I think will happen.
01:03:08.840 - 01:03:18.284, Speaker A: The usability and the utility for Solana will increase over time dramatically, and you will stay great, you know, and I think that is the world I think we are going to be ready for.
01:03:18.372 - 01:03:36.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I fully agree. And the world hasn't even started thinking about fire dancer either. So I think that's where we go from broadband to fiber optics, which will be very interesting as well. But really appreciate you coming on. Meow. Very spirited conversation. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
01:03:36.090 - 01:03:52.630, Speaker B: You and the Jupiter team have been absolutely crushing it, and I hope that you guys continue to be a very active and proud Solana community member because you guys are great representations.
01:03:53.130 - 01:04:00.578, Speaker A: Cool. Amazing. Thanks for chat, really, again, thanks for being here through everything, you know.
01:04:00.634 - 01:04:00.898, Speaker C: Right.
01:04:00.954 - 01:04:07.850, Speaker A: And, yeah, thanks for the conversation. A lot of things I haven't said annually before, so it's really fun. Yeah. Thank you.
