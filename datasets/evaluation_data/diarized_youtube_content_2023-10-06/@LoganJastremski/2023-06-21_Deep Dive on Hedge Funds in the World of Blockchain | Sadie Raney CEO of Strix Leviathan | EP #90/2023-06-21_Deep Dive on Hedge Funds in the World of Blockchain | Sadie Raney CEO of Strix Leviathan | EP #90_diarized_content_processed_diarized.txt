00:00:00.240 - 00:01:08.854, Speaker A: Today's podcast was a little bit different. Instead of talking about virtual machines, data propagation and execution environments, debating L2s or layer ones, I actually sat down and learned about a different side of the crypto business, the hedge fund business and trading. And I sat down with Sadie Rainey, a hedge fund based off quantitative modeling and purely off the models that they built for crypto trading. It's a different conversation than you're probably normally used to, but it was a lot of fun and chatting with someone that has a different perspective in the space. I just want to start with a little bit about the fund you started in the bear market and just what it's kind of been like just being involved, kind of on the institutional side, through the ups and downs, going through the bull market in 2021, kind of all the stuff that's been happening afterwards in the bear markets, always something crazy going on with either FTX or you name it, but kind of just from your funds lifecycle, and then a little bit also about your thesis and just kind of how you're thinking about the market.
00:01:08.942 - 00:01:35.590, Speaker B: Yeah. So thanks again for having me on here. This is. I'm looking forward to our conversation. I've listened to some of your episodes this week and some good content. So excited about the conversation. Yes, we started in 2018 in the bull market, and that, you know, at the time, we kind of kicked ourselves and were regretting our timing of entering the market.
00:01:35.590 - 00:02:22.530, Speaker B: But now it's actually been kind of an asset for us because we, you know, we slogged it out for a couple years and, you know, it was all about surviving and building and, you know, focusing on our tech and waiting for the markets to come back. And so then when the bull run hit in 2021, you know, we, we didn't take it for granted and we just kept building and kept being conservative in everything we did. Cause we knew it wasn't gonna last. And we're gonna see lots of these cycles. And I think that's why we're still here today and why we're still doing well is because we knew that the bear market was coming again. And that's kinda how we cut our teeth. And that kind of goes into our thesis, too.
00:02:22.530 - 00:03:02.020, Speaker B: We don't make fundamental bets on any of these assets. We leave that to the VC's. If you want to make a fundamental bet on a protocol, great. But that's a VC's job. Or somebody that's going to do a buy and hold, you're going to buy this and you're going to hold onto it. For five to ten years and try not to watch it because it's like being on a roller coaster. What we do is we believe that an active management thesis is the best way to manage the volatility of these assets and the best way to honestly stomach these markets.
00:03:02.020 - 00:03:57.056, Speaker B: So, you know, everything's data driven. We've built our own platform that we develop our algorithms, we use a lot of proprietary methods in regards to our data to really identify trends in these markets, because even the most fundamentally sound asset in this market during any kind of major event, is going to drop. And so we believe that actively managing in and out of all of your positions is the best way to capture the most return in these markets. And so we've just built our thesis around active management and we're a really technical team, so it's very, very data driven. We don't have anyone who's making judgment calls on when to go in and when to go out. We really listen to the data and listen to our algos, and that's how we trade.
00:03:57.148 - 00:04:35.320, Speaker A: That's amazing. I guess, like maybe backing up, like starting in 2018, I remember, was not a super fun time, even just being involved in the markets. What gave you, I would say, leading up to or even after kind of that bear market started in 2018? I think we had like a 95 plus percent drawdown on ETH from 1100 $1200 to $80. You must have had pretty strong conviction in the crypto and the blockchain markets to be able to say, this is what I want to spend my time doing, and go out, try to raise that money from limited partners and actually start to fund in a bear market. That's not easy.
00:04:35.820 - 00:05:08.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us it was really that it's such an interesting technical problem. And when we got into these markets, they were super immature, and I'd say they still are really immature. And the reason we built the fund was actually my co founder, Jesse. So Jesse and I met, kind of going back a little bit. Jesse and I met at his prior startup, which was called Blue Box. It was a private cloud company in Seattle. I was his financial controller.
00:05:08.210 - 00:06:16.820, Speaker B: We sold that company to IBM in 2015 and then 2016, he ended up rolling more into their blockchain group and was dabbling in crypto through 2016, 2017. And I can remember being at a barbecue in 2017 and he had two laptops, and I was like, what are you doing? And he said, I'm mining ethereum. And I was like, okay, we're all having burgers and beer and you're over there mining ethereum. But it was kind of an interesting thing to look at. But then towards the end of 2017, he started trading more actively, and the markets were so, I guess, simple back then, too. He was like, I can see these patterns in the price, but I can't actually execute fast enough because all the tools are just terrible. The original idea was, hey, let's build a trading platform that can execute via API, and we can actually execute these trades and capture some of this.
00:06:16.820 - 00:07:28.568, Speaker B: We started building out the platform and raising for the fund at the same time and built this fantastic software platform. But then we're a little bit shocked to find out that none of our trading parties could trade by API. So we built our system out so that you could just plug in websockets and APIs to different counterparties. And all of our counterparties were like, yeah, can we trade in Skype? So that was a little bit of a shock for us, but it ended up being one of our biggest advantages because we've always, as soon as anyone brought API pricing online or trade execution online, we immediately plugged it into our system and we were able to really execute fast. We have reporting that's really, really tight as well. So we just, in a lot of ways, just been a little bit technically ahead, I think, of the market and of our counterparties sometime. But I, that really is what led us to building this, is that it was more of a technical challenge of, hey, this is an area where there's really bad tech, which is ironic because it's a digital asset.
00:07:28.568 - 00:07:34.472, Speaker B: But, like, we can build. We can build some really good tech and we can get an advantage, and we did.
00:07:34.616 - 00:08:28.110, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely want to dive a little bit deeper into some of the things that you've seen the industry grow through. And just being early in 2018, there wasn't a lot of institutional kind of support back then. But I think before we're diving deeper into that, I would love to just talk a little bit about, like, how you kind of raise the fund, if you can, just being on the other side myself on raising a fund or in the process of kind of going through those motions now, it's not an easy process. Can you talk about, especially in the bear market, where there's not a lot of FOMo, the coins have gone down quite substantially, people kind of fever pitch is worn off. Can you talk about kind of that slog of just building the company and the firm and that bear market and how it was kind of during that time to go out and try to raise capital?
00:08:28.610 - 00:08:57.414, Speaker B: So when we first started trying to raise for the fund. The funniest part was that people, we found that it was always one of two things. They were interested in the fund or they were interested in our tech platform. So we did a round for the tech platform, and that closed in, like, six weeks. And I think it would have closed in four, but one of the LP's was, like, in Tahiti or something. He's like, I can't sign the documents for two more weeks. But it closed super fast.
00:08:57.414 - 00:09:38.118, Speaker B: And then when we launched our first month of trading for the fund, I mean, we had $520,000, I think. And it was just a slog. I mean, it was, you had so many conversations where you were just educating investors over and over and over again. And so when we started building, it was, you know, friends and friends and family, people that we knew in our networks. Jesse had a great network from his exit at IBM. So there was a lot of people who knew that he had already been a successful entrepreneur and were excited and interested in what we were doing. But it was a lot of little checks.
00:09:38.118 - 00:10:43.510, Speaker B: It was a lot of meeting after meeting after meeting of really just explaining what it is we do and what crypto is and the difference between bitcoin and blockchain and ethereum. And I'd say for every 30 conversations we had an investor commit, a lot of people were just, you know, just wanted to kind of dip their toe in, and, you know, we just, we buckled down and we knew we had to build a track record and, you know, just continue to trade and build our systems and build track record, and, you know, I wouldn't say it's easy. We, you know, we still probably are constantly educating and talking to people. I mean, I live, I'm from a very small town in northern Washington state, and, you know, when I go back home to visit many times, people say, so what do you do? And I'll tell them. And it's just blank stare. They're like, I don't have any idea what you just said. You just spoke another language to me.
00:10:43.510 - 00:10:56.878, Speaker B: What is bitcoin? So we're still really far away from people, even mainstream, really understanding it. And so it's still just a lot about education and conversations over and over again.
00:10:57.014 - 00:11:31.748, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And I hear similar stories. Often, whether it be crypto or just starting a company, I kind of feel like starting a firm in some sense, I think, relates very similarly to starting a company. You're going through the same motions. You got to create the llcs and go out fundraise, all that kind of stuff that typical founders have to do as well. And I think more often not. What I find when I talk with people is just that persistence and starting small and kind of continuing to grow and just not give up.
00:11:31.748 - 00:12:06.490, Speaker A: And especially at a time like 2018 where markets kind of puked and the appetite was just not there, it's super impressive that you and the team were able to kind of continue through and stick with it. It's definitely a challenge. Can you speak a little bit more, though? You said within six weeks, you ultimately raised the software side for the fund to raise the money for what you had built with the software. Can you talk a little bit more about that, why people were so excited at that point in time with what you built?
00:12:07.190 - 00:13:07.724, Speaker B: So the reason I think people were so excited was because there just weren't good tools in the market. And trading, you know, trading from a technical perspective was really, really difficult. We were meeting funds that had Google spreadsheets and they were tracking their trades in Google spreadsheets, and they were manually, manually negotiating the prices and manually settling, and we had to do a fair amount of that as well. But we built our system so that our system could do that. And we were trading with our system on day one, and there just wasn't other tools in the market that could do that. You know, over the next couple years, we got approached by, you know, prime brokers and different people, you know, trade, execution, you know, best price, and, you know, we already had all that built into our system. So, you know, I think we're a team that doesn't like to sleep, too.
00:13:07.724 - 00:13:23.634, Speaker B: So, you know, we decided to launch the company in December of 2017, and we actually had the software up and running for our first trades in April. And that's just the timeline that we worked on. So people saw how quickly we were building and got excited about it.
00:13:23.722 - 00:13:55.000, Speaker A: Amazing. How do you feel? Like just starting in the 2017 2018 timeframe, obviously, now the market is starting to get more sophisticated and just people's awareness about it, being able to communicate it. There's still, I would say, lots of technical challenge and even regulatory challenges that the industry faced. But how has the progression since you've joined the market been with other firms and even on the software side, how has that developed over time?
00:13:55.340 - 00:14:34.286, Speaker B: It's been developing in fits and starts, and there's definitely fads where one year it was custody, everybody was building custody, and the next year it was best execution, and everybody was building best execution software. You know, every boom and bust cycle, those a lot of those projects just go bust. And so sadly, we're seeing some technology that's really, really good, but it just gets abandoned. And, you know, what's still there is still pretty rudimentary. And, you know, you can't pull prices. You know, you can't, you can't high frequency trade in crypto. Like, you can't, you can't execute that fast.
00:14:34.286 - 00:15:14.390, Speaker B: You can't pull prices that fast. Like, there's, everything's just on a slower scale and we're getting there. You know, the FTX situation was really disappointing because their exchange works really well from a technical perspective. It was a great exchange and their execution was great. Their reporting was really solid, was reliable. Unfortunately, the people don't appear to be that were behind it. But, you know, every time they talk about reviving that exchange, you know, obviously from a technical perspective, we're excited about that concept because it's really good tech.
00:15:14.390 - 00:15:57.210, Speaker B: Whereas other exchanges, sometimes I won't name them, but there's another exchange that if you go in and you want to pull reporting, you have to manually go in and pull reporting. And every time you change a setting or a filter on the report, it refreshes 30 seconds later. And that's insane that this is a highly technical industry and we still have so many tools that don't work. I think the custody piece is really interesting and obviously with everything going on right now, there's a lot of focus on that. We've seen that really advance over the years. The data piece too. The data was super fragmented.
00:15:57.210 - 00:16:34.540, Speaker B: One of the first things we built in our platform was a data ingestion engine and it ingests data constantly and it normalizes that data. And I mean, it's just simple things. Like one pair is priced in BTC, it's a BTC USD, and the other one's priced in USD. And so you've got to normalize the price and then timestamps are all over the place. I mean, it's just like there's no consistency on any of the pricing data. So we had to actually build a system that cleaned that data and stored that data. And I think when we first started, there was tons and tons of services that were offering to give you that data.
00:16:34.540 - 00:16:52.626, Speaker B: You know, now you can pretty much pull it yourself if you know how to. So some of the pieces of the industry have really improved. Unfortunately, this year we've seen a lot of really interesting companies just start to shut down or delay offerings. So that's been sad to see.
00:16:52.738 - 00:17:11.378, Speaker A: So maybe just to clarify, it's not particularly the blockchain infrastructure that's the limiting piece. It's the supporting pieces around it, the infrastructure that allows you to trade the quality of data, the reporting of the data that is really still not at par where it should be.
00:17:11.474 - 00:18:01.968, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. We launched, we spun a company out in 2020 or 2021, excuse me, called Makara, which was an SEC registered robo advisor for crypto. And we sold that actually last year to betterment. It's now the betterment for crypto product. And when we were building that, we needed to build on top of an exchange and a custodian. And when we went out to the market to see who could have, you know, who could meet the technical requirements that we needed, you know, just for like, separately managed accounts, for example. You know, we talked to everybody we could find and, you know, there were three people that could do it, you know, and then, and then you start talking through, like, what each of those, which, which tokens each of those can support, and then the list got smaller.
00:18:01.968 - 00:18:18.088, Speaker B: And then, you know, then you go into just, just like some of the reporting pieces of it, and then there was just one. And so we built on top of that one. So there's just not very robust offerings yet in the market.
00:18:18.224 - 00:18:46.150, Speaker A: Do you think that is ultimately a result from entrepreneurs not recognizing the opportunity, or do you feel like it's people are scared of the regulatory aspects and not willing to try to create something? What do you think is the core bottleneck that has kind of prevented the industry from adopting best practices after kind of. I mean, definitely now it's in mainstream kind of center view. Why does it exist?
00:18:46.650 - 00:19:09.640, Speaker B: I think it's an attention, attention issue, and there's just so much to do. I mean, there's this industry. One of the reasons I love this industry is because it's fascinating. And every time I turn around, there's something totally new. And, you know, when we started, there was Defi, wasn't a thing. There was staking, wasn't even a thing. Nfts, nobody talked about.
00:19:09.640 - 00:20:11.830, Speaker B: I mean, I think they were there, but they were just sort of like a little hobby that some people had. And now it's like every time you turn around, the industry is building and developing or creating something new. And so when you're an entrepreneur in this space and you're building a company, it's like, what do you focus on and you can build and towards your idea? And I think we're just all in a race to get our products built and some of the stuff, the actual nuts and bolts and operational pieces you don't really think about until suddenly you're trying to launch and then your customers are asking for it. And so I think it's a lack of attention because we're so focused on building and we're so focused on keeping up with what's new. And a lot of companies, you see them start to backfill some of those pieces later, but they're not the exciting pieces. Nobody gets into crypto because they want to build reporting modules within their platform. It's boring stuff.
00:20:12.130 - 00:20:53.644, Speaker A: That's true. Well, hopefully, now that the bear market is here, things move a little bit slower. We can talk about what went right, what went wrong in the last bull market. Hopefully, the infrastructure reporting, even custody solutions continue to get bolstered. We have a little bit more clarity from our government so that these things can exist. Because I think, like you, I think the industry is probably the most fascinating thing that's going on in tech. There's some other fields, but what I appreciate specifically about crypto is the democracy or democratization of access, and anybody can build.
00:20:53.644 - 00:21:13.644, Speaker A: It doesn't really cost a lot of money. Entrepreneurs can come in and have a laptop and an Internet connection and start to publish these things, and I think the industry will flourish because of that. So hopefully more exciting things to come. And as we get more people focused on the space and building in bear markets.
00:21:13.732 - 00:21:29.392, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. I mean, who knows what they're going to come up with, what we're going to come up with next? I mean, what we're going to work on. I mean, what my kids are going to be doing in blockchain and crypto in 20 years, it's going to be mind blowing and stuff that we can't even imagine right now.
00:21:29.496 - 00:22:07.860, Speaker A: 100%. How do you feel like, I mean, so ultimately, you set up the fund in 2018, kind of started the operational, got the software all set in stone, going into kind of the bull market of 2021, how, I guess kind of going into it and coming out of it, even throughout the bear market. How did you think about that process? Did you think about it going to be similar to the 2017 ramp up and ultimately drawback, or did you just focus on data and what your systems were really highlighting?
00:22:08.160 - 00:23:08.306, Speaker B: We really focused on the data, which is hard. Right? I mean, in the bull market, you know, you get super excited and, you know, you don't want it to end, but you kind of know it's gonna. And so it, you know, that's one of those situations where we really had to trust our system and, you know, really just believe in what we built and stick with it. And we did. And, but there were definitely days, you know, you know, you. In our trading strategy, we're going to catch most of the run up and we're going to catch a little bit of the drawdown, but if we're doing our job well, then we're going to catch the middle. But when you exit the market, because the Algos are telling you that things are getting soft and the price is still going up, and you're looking at those charts and you're just, oh, God, it's so hard, but you have to trust your systems and you have to exit when they tell you to.
00:23:08.306 - 00:24:17.328, Speaker B: The minute you start ignoring your algos, your algos become worthless. So if you're an algo trader, you trade with the algos, and that's really, really hard. And some of our team members, they trade a little bit on the side too, and some of them did well and some of them didn't because they were like, oh, I totally had faith that this was going to keep going, but then it didn't have, and they're trading different stuff than what the fund trades, but they get really caught up in it. So it's a good thing that we have the algos, I think, to rein us in, and kind of same goes true for investors. When bitcoin's at 60k, people are just knocking on the door because they want to invest. Everybody's downloading the app, everyone's opening a wallet and texting you to see what they should buy, you know, and then it drops down to 25 and nobody wants to touch it and they're all like, ready to abandon it and you're like, wait a second, aren't you the, like the one that wanted to buy it at, now you want to sell it at 25? Like, you gotta, you gotta take the emotions out of it, truly.
00:24:17.424 - 00:24:53.620, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. I've heard once Coinbase becomes the number one application in the app store, it's probably getting very close to the top. And I think it's been a reliable indicator for the last few cycles. But it is funny, the same people that want to buy the top are the first ones to leave once things take a slightly turn for the worse. But speaking to, like, the algorithms, I know you can't go into the specifics or ultimately all the variables that work, but is there any particular metrics, either one or two that you can maybe speak to that you particularly keep a close eye on, that you could talk about?
00:24:54.000 - 00:25:42.896, Speaker B: Honestly, the thing that we look at the most is, you know, volatility and, you know, volume. And with this, you know, doing any kind of sizable trading or turning over a fund a lot in a month, you really have to go where the liquidity is. And, you know, so we've got a lot of our indicators focused on, you know, volume and liquidity and then, obviously, price, where most of our strategies, strategies are momentum based. And so we're just always looking for that shift in the market and that early signal that things are turning. And we trade across the top 20. So not all the top 20, obviously, but across the top 20. And we've got anywhere from six to ten algorithms across those at all times.
00:25:42.896 - 00:25:51.936, Speaker B: And so we have to have a lot of liquidity wherever we're trading, and then we have to be able to have actionable signals.
00:25:52.088 - 00:26:24.834, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is interesting. It's surprising. I guess. The top 20 is not always changing, but every bull market and bear market, I'm surprised how what made it to the top and what did not. But as you pointed out, the volumes are extremely important. And it's funny, even some of the meme tokens being able to get into the top 20 and how much liquidity they actually have, it's quite impressive, actually. But maybe reflecting on kind of the 2021 bear markethood, obviously, there is lots of learning lessons.
00:26:24.834 - 00:26:32.510, Speaker A: As with any bull market, were there any in particular that you can think of that were maybe different from 2017?
00:26:33.210 - 00:27:59.556, Speaker B: So we, you know, 2017, you just, you really traded the top three, and, you know, you really, you traded the top three, and really, everything moved with bitcoin. So, you know, in some ways, our, our algos were a little, you know, were a little strapped for data when we first started to try to find more of an edge. And in 2021, when you saw so many coins flying into the top 20 and back out, that was actually one of the things that we learned is we really tweaked our algos that pick what's in the top 20, so it's not what's in the top 20 this week based on trailing averages and things like that. And so we had to get a lot smarter because you had a lot of coins that would sort of pop in, that you'd go, ooh, no, we're not trading that. But then also, we really, it allowed us to expand our strategies pretty aggressively, too, because there was suddenly a lot more depth in the market, and you started seeing stuff diverge. And so trying to pick up some of those diverging trends was something that we started looking at, too, because stuff sometimes now doesn't move just with bitcoin. And so you have to try to identify what is moving the market and what's falling it and what's not.
00:27:59.668 - 00:28:58.186, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is fascinating. I think the hedge fund world and kind of the liquidity, figuring out what to trade, what to nothing, it's a deep rabbit hole. And I think maybe not one that more broadly, I would say retail has kind of more broadly, retail, I would say, is kind of learning about more investment, more the flows even. I think Robin Hood kind of highlighted how some of these things have worked. But I think outside of just the mechanics of it, one thing that the entire industry has been paying a lot more focus on has been macro and the Federal Reserve and interest rates. And I think tech investors for the first time are now macro enthusiasts and excited about macro. Can you talk about a little bit just what your thoughts are on macro? Obviously, interest rates have been rising.
00:28:58.186 - 00:29:03.790, Speaker A: How do you think this affects crypto or even funds more broadly?
00:29:04.370 - 00:29:59.742, Speaker B: It's really interesting. There's so many different narratives and there's so much news, especially about interest rates and inflation and central bank and what governments are doing to manage everything. And we watch all those narratives and we read all the news and we look at things. But from our perspective, it's not typically that much of an impact in general on the more sophisticated investors and institutional investors in crypto, because it's not, you know, we're not having, we don't have investors who are investing a large chunk of their portfolio. You know, they're more, they're high net worth or ultra high net worth individuals or family offices. And, you know, they've got their small allocation to, you know, very high risk assets, and that's where crypto falls. So, you know, it's a different bucket.
00:29:59.742 - 00:31:20.700, Speaker B: So, you know, somebody who's investing, you know, 1% of their portfolio into crypto isn't, you know, it's not that 1% isn't, it's not like, oh, I'm going to put that in treasuries or crypto, you know, that's coming out of a different bucket. And, you know, we tend to see that people, you know, in our investor base, you know, they're, they're less concerned about some of the, you know, the inflationary questions and interest rates and, you know, they're just happy to let their crypto allocation sit there and not think about it for a while. You know, I'm sure they're, you know, reallocating their portfolio in other ways, but we haven't really seen a huge impact on specific crypto investors. I think it has much more impact on retail investors because unfortunately, there's just so much information you can't. If you're a retail investor, I mean, it means you typically have a day job where you actually do something else and, you know, you're trading on your lunch break or at night or, you know, on your phone, and, you know, you're, you're reading a these articles, and one article is telling you, this is great for the price, and the next article is telling you, oh, it's terrible. And one article is telling you to buy, one article is telling you to sell. And for a retail investor, trying to figure out how to do that on your own, it's really, really hard.
00:31:20.700 - 00:31:37.290, Speaker B: So I think they're much more reactionary and trying to figure out how to manage their holdings. But for our investor base, they tend to, you know, they have their high risk allocation and they're just, they're content to kind of leave it there and let it ride and see what happens.
00:31:37.410 - 00:32:27.588, Speaker A: I've heard by quite a few people that, like, just allocate one to 2% of your net worth into crypto or some other, like, higher risk asset and then just like, don't forget about it. But I think what we've seen, or at least now that technology more broadly has kind of been mature, a much larger kind of, I would say, percentage of people's portfolio than it once was, what do you think it will take for people to maybe put five or 10% of their net worth into crypto assets? Do you think it'll take usable products? Regulatory clarity. How do we get more adoption or people, especially outside, I mean, high net worth individuals, but even retail as well, more educated about this asset class as a whole, to feel comfortable allocating to.
00:32:27.604 - 00:33:23.856, Speaker B: It, I think it's really just going to be making it easier for people. You know, I mean, it's still really hard to use, and I forget about that. You probably do because you're in it all the time. So, you know, trying to, you know, explain the nuances between, you know, defi and nfts, like, it's just sort of, we're used to it. And, you know, for the everyday person who has job, life, family, other things, they don't have time to educate themselves on what a crypto wallet is, what a private key is, and it's just super overwhelming and super confusing. And it's not as simple as just downloading an app and using it. I guess it is in some ways, but if somebody's curious about nfts, but they also want to buy a few different tokens, it's really hard for that average person to just go and figure out how to do that.
00:33:23.856 - 00:33:50.034, Speaker B: And until it's seamless and until it's something like PayPal or Venmo where people are able to just, without thinking, download the app and it's connected to everything they want to connect it to, and it intuitively makes sense. I think we're not going to see a ton of adoption for people to put a larger part of their portfolio into it because they just don't trust it, because they don't understand it.
00:33:50.152 - 00:34:39.934, Speaker A: Yeah. And I would say I was much more excited about this past cycle than 2017 because 2017, you could write a white paper and just launch a token, have no product, and the token go up 100 x. We've come quite a bit from that point in time. At least now we have usable products, we have Uniswap OpenSea, we have different NFT trading platforms, Magic, Eden, Tensor. But it's remarkable how far we've actually come. And I think I appreciate today that we have usable products, but as you mentioned, the user experience and the user design still needs to be improved vastly to actually go from low millions, low ten millions to hundreds of millions of billions. But we're making progress slowly but surely.
00:34:40.062 - 00:35:43.360, Speaker B: Yeah. And also, like, I guess interoperability is like a big thing, too. I guess I probably should have mentioned that for the NFT example, like, if somebody wants to buy an NFT, I had a friend who was trying to buy a couple different things and they were super frustrated because they needed Solana to buy one and then they needed eth to buy the other and they were super confused and they were super frustrated and they're really new to it and they're like, I don't understand. I own bitcoin, how do I buy this NFT? And I'm trying to explain to them, well, you've got to trade walking through it and it gets very, very frustrating. And so I think some of that is coming and there's some really cool projects that are working on that very problem. But that's a whole other security conversation, too, about the risks of that. So until we get more cross functionality across chains for the everyday user, I think it's also going to be a little bit of a barrier for people.
00:35:43.810 - 00:36:30.320, Speaker A: We definitely need to make it more frictionless. It is a little bit cumbersome. How do you feel? Like, I mean, I think outside of just the product experience. I think obviously the US has kind of taken a little bit of a negative stance. I know you're not a lawyer and don't want to ask you specific legal questions, but on a high level, what is just your kind of take on the US's approach to kind of dealing with crypto? Have you seen, I know you're not kind of investing in early stage teams per se, but do you feel like teams will move overseas? When you talk with foundations or anybody building the technology, what is kind of your sense that you get from them?
00:36:30.740 - 00:37:15.320, Speaker B: So one of the things that I think is really important for people to realize, you know, is that's a slow process for any kind of government or regulatory decisions. The ripple case started, I don't know, is it two and a half, three years ago now? And we're still looking for clarity on that. There's a lot of stuff happening right now that is really getting people pretty wound up in one way or another. The wheels turn slowly and we knew it was coming. And there's obviously people who are very doomsday. The sky's falling. This is the end of the world.
00:37:15.320 - 00:38:15.380, Speaker B: But the thing I always point to is if you go to any major financial institution in the United States, they all have blockchain teams. They all have teams that are, some of them are even mining and they're, they're probably building their own coins behind closed doors. And they're all just kind of waiting on the wings right now to get a little bit more clarity because traditional finance is much more conservative and the ones that have survived and been around for 100 years have done so because they've been conservative. And that's what they're doing here, too. Once they start feeling more comfortable, once some of these decisions start, you know, being made, I think we're going to start seeing those floodgates open. You know, obviously, we didn't want to see regulation by enforcement, but that appears to be the current path that's being taken. And, you know, we'll see how some of that pans out.
00:38:15.380 - 00:39:31.854, Speaker B: And it's really, I mean, it's really too early to tell. But, you know, I do think in the long run, once some of these bigger institutions get more comfortable based on the outcomes of some of the things that are happening right now, then you're actually going to start seeing bigger names that are mainstream names that are going to come into the industry and that, I mean, that's only going to be a positive because that's when you're going to start seeing volume that's when you're going to start seeing much more diversity of offerings and some of the bigger institutions starting to compete with each other. I'm kind of excited to see some of those little battles and what they're able to build. You know, there's a lot of distressed crypto companies right now. There's a lot of startups that have built some really cool things and, you know, the blood's kind of in the water. And so you're seeing, I was talking to a VC recently who said they've seen a higher volume of m and a deals and crypto so far this year than they have in the five or six years that they've been doing this. You know, the dollar values are much lower, obviously, because they're getting a lot of bargains, but, you know, a lot of these bigger companies are coming in and swooping up, some of this really cool technology, and I think that's all going to come flooding in once people are more comfortable.
00:39:31.854 - 00:39:37.614, Speaker B: And until we get through some of these pain points, they're not going to come in.
00:39:37.702 - 00:40:19.858, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is frustrating. And I think even now, personally, some of the conversations with limited partners, being able to explain some of the nuance and clarity, it is difficult. And I think everybody would appreciate, especially, I know the entrepreneurs that I speak with as well would love that clarity so they don't have to necessarily move or relocate their company outside of the US. I think I appreciate crypto and the fact that it is global. And I think regardless of whether the US is kind of forward thinking or not, the industry will obviously still exist and move forward even if the US shoots itself in the foot. But no, I definitely think everybody would appreciate more clarity.
00:40:20.034 - 00:40:20.602, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:20.706 - 00:40:55.770, Speaker A: How? I mean, in terms of market makers, I think, I've read articles recently and I think you would know quite more about this than I. Just on the trading side, do you feel like obviously in bear markets volumes come down? Maybe we get some crazy volatility if we don't have as much volume. But can you speak to what you've seen on like the market maker side, particularly say in the bear market? But, but also some of them just saying, look, we're not going to market make because there's not as much clarity in the US.
00:40:56.470 - 00:41:49.586, Speaker B: Yeah. The big thing that we're seeing with the market making, especially with some of the bigger players stepping out of the industry, is we have a pretty strong opinion about market making in crypto and that to date, many of the market makers that are out there have done more damage than good. And that's because they're focused on revenue. They have to be. Every company is focused on revenue, right? But market makers, they have to follow their revenue. And so they are following the volume and they're following the liquidity in these markets. And these markets are so fractured, that actually ends up being a negative for some of these tokens that are really, they're just trying to build up their user base on multiple different exchanges.
00:41:49.586 - 00:43:02.562, Speaker B: And when they've got a market maker that's focusing on the most profitable and the liquidity is drying up on the others, then you lose users. And it's like the chicken and the egg problem. You need users to get liquidity, but in order to get liquidity, you need users. And if you've got a market maker that's jumping around and retail investors or traders that are trying to follow that, it really kind of damages some of the projects and some of these other projects that have layer ones and L2s. You've got also the problem of cross chain liquidity there, where if you're in l one, you want l two s building on top of you. But if they don't have volume, if they can't get volume and they can't get liquidity building on top of your l one, then they're going to go somewhere else. And so we've been looking into ways that we could structure some projects where you could actually focus on some of that liquidity for those subchains and l two s and help them build, because some of these guys are live or die based on the price of their token.
00:43:02.562 - 00:43:27.508, Speaker B: And that's how they're funding their operations. And if they've, they're working with market makers because they want to build that liquidity. But at the same time, sometimes it's actually damaging the price of their project. So we don't feel right now that a lot of the market makers in the industry are helping. There are some good ones out there, but in general, it's a negative, I think, for most of them.
00:43:27.604 - 00:43:48.640, Speaker A: What do you feel like would be the catalyst for more healthy market making within crypto? Is it just more competition? Kind of more people entering the space again, going back to that regulatory clarity, getting people clarity that they need to make markets, what do you feel like it will bring better health to the industry.
00:43:49.140 - 00:44:46.006, Speaker B: So I think you're going to have to have more competition. You're going to have to have more functionality across market making. Some of them actually just don't have the tools that are needed to manage multiple venues at any time. It's almost like flipping a switch, they're market making on this exchange, and then they actually don't even have the technical capabilities to move and switch somewhere else because they're a small shop and their tech isn't equipped for that. So they're literally market making on one and then they switch and market make on others. You need somebody who has the technical capabilities to market make across multiple exchanges at the same time, and you have to make sure that they're not arbing the price against you. And if they're an independent market maker, that's their business.
00:44:46.006 - 00:44:58.646, Speaker B: So finding projects where they can work with l one s to help promote their ecosystem would be one way that market making could really help the industry.
00:44:58.798 - 00:45:26.454, Speaker A: Yeah, it is fascinating. I normally kind of deep dive the technical nuance of the different l ones, l two s, how virtual machines work, consensus, how they propagate data. But I think this is kind of a refreshing and different conversation, seeing kind of more the back office of how these tokens get traded, the market making. There's a lot more nuance that I think people will truly appreciate.
00:45:26.582 - 00:45:47.910, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a highly technical problem, especially in this industry. If you're trying to, I mean, if you're trying to market make more than, than like your basic top five, if you want to do anything interesting and complicated, it's a super technical problem, especially if you want to market make and on chain and defi, that's a whole new beast.
00:45:49.090 - 00:46:06.864, Speaker A: Speaking on the topic of Defi, do you feel like blockchain rails can ultimately accommodate some of this stuff? I know it's very early, but do you ever envision a future wherever I. More things can actually be done on chain than they are kind of off chain as they are today.
00:46:06.992 - 00:46:39.662, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, there's multiple projects that we know that are focused on that problem specifically. And it's just, it's kind of mind blowing to see what some of these people are building. And, you know, you go to, I just actually went to the avalanche summit last month in Barcelona and I, you know, seeing some of the stuff that people were building, it's just kind of mind blowing. So I absolutely think that blockchain is going to be a solution for that among, you know, a thousand or a thousand thousand other things.
00:46:39.806 - 00:47:24.370, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm definitely excited for things to move on chain as well. I think we're hopefully now kind of getting out of the infrastructure phase, applications actually being built. Now we just need to streamline those applications, make them a little bit more usable and friendly but I am optimistic that we can do more things on chain. I think the door is just now opening, and I'm excited again for entrepreneurs building in the bear market to take advantage of that. But speaking more broadly to crypto, I think crypto just being a smaller industry, having a token involved, being a newer technology stack, there's lots of narratives. People will say, my chain is better. No, my chain is more decentralized.
00:47:24.370 - 00:47:38.334, Speaker A: My chain has 10,000 supply, whatever it may be. How do you personally kind of cut through the noise, figure out what to read, what not to read? How do you kind of consume content within the cryptosphere?
00:47:38.462 - 00:48:59.250, Speaker B: I read a ton, listen to podcasts, and, you know, it's kind of hard because there's just a lot of really quirky, interesting projects that are just completely on the fringe that, you know, I'm reading all the daily stuff, all the major news stories, which unfortunately, every newsletter has the same five stories every day. But then just following people on Twitter or actually, the biggest source of interesting fringe news is from my team. We've got some brilliant, interesting people on our team, and we're always dropping interesting articles in slack. But I find myself digging into some of these fringe use cases a lot more and more out of a curiosity of, okay, what's this thing going to do? And how's it going to build and everything from carbon credits and not even buying and selling carbon credits, but manipulation of offsets and things like that. And how's that going to factor into this? To nfts for healthcare services and bundling healthcare on the blockchain and using a token to incentivize people. So I could read all day, every day. I'm sure you feel like that, too.
00:48:59.250 - 00:49:40.850, Speaker B: It's just like you can't absorb enough, you know? And then I also, I don't know if I'm cynical from being in this industry for six years, but there's a lot of stuff that gets hyped, you know, and I'll kind of read an article or two about it, but, you know, a lot of times it's hyped one week and it's gone the next. And so I typically, any kind of new super interesting thing that people are all talking about, I tend to wait until it's been around for a few weeks before I spend a lot of time reading about it. I don't know if that's because I'm cynical or what, or if I'm just trying to be good about my time usage, but a lot of stuff comes and goes, and people talk about it for a week and then it's gone.
00:49:40.970 - 00:50:21.740, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely echo that sentiment. And definitely being on Twitter, you see that more often than nothing, people will hype things up and as you mentioned, they're gone the next week. And so I think the blockchain industry as a whole has a kind of very quick mind, and then we'll move on to different things. Are there any particular podcasts or news sources that you enjoy more so than others that you feel like are consistently producing high quality things? Like, if I were someone that didn't know anything about the industry I was trying to learn, would there be any particular kind of places that you would point me to to start?
00:50:22.760 - 00:51:18.464, Speaker B: So the book I always tell people to read when they first get into crypto is how money got free, because that's a really fun book. And I think it puts a lot of things in more simple terms. And so that's the first thing I always recommend people read. And then I think I, so the thing that I really enjoy reading right now, I try to read it every day or every time it comes out, is the Bloomberg crypto, because I feel like it's kind of like an outsider's perspective on the industry. We're on Twitter and we're on slack and we're kind of in our own little universe reading articles and telegram and whatnot. And so we're just kind of inundated with our little bit of our own thoughts. A lot of times, you know, Bloomberg seems to be a little bit more aloof and it seems to be a little bit more of what like the everyday people see in crypto.
00:51:18.464 - 00:51:47.230, Speaker B: And also it's, they haven't drank the Kool aid as much. So, you know, they can be a little cynical. And sometimes I'll step back and I'll be like, oh, yeah, you know, that is a good point. Maybe I shouldn't just, you know, accept this as a given. So I do like, you know, reading that and then, I don't know. I mean, there's some people that I follow on Twitter, but I find that actually I cycle through who I follow on Twitter pretty regularly because it gets a little bit repetitive.
00:51:49.810 - 00:52:22.522, Speaker A: I definitely agree. I think having the outsider perspective is important, especially for you and I spending as much time as we do every day in the industry, deep in kind of the news on Twitter, you often forget that there is another world that exists outside of our crypto bubble. People don't often think the same ways that we do. And it's refreshing to be like, oh, we're still early. We have to appreciate that the industry has not really scaled, but that's why we're here and that's why we're optimistic.
00:52:22.626 - 00:52:35.254, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I couldn't agree more. Sometimes I'm like, so much has happened, and then you have to remind yourself, this is still super, super early, just beginning, 100%.
00:52:35.382 - 00:52:58.370, Speaker A: Are there any particular things that you're either looking forward to for the remaining of 2023 or even going into 2024? I know, obviously robust infrastructure, reporting tools, security for custody solutions. But is there anything that you're uniquely excited about or that is not built yet that you were like, please build?
00:53:00.240 - 00:54:21.474, Speaker B: So I know it's kind of buzz wordy and trendy right now, but the AI craze I'm really curious and excited to see over the next year what use cases come out of this kind of AI frenzy combined with crypto. I was just reading an article today that was like, who will win AI or crypto? And I was like, why are they fighting to the death? I think they can coexist, and I bet they're going to do some really, really cool things when you combine them, you know? And so I'm just super curious to see what the use cases are. Quantum computing is another thing that I'm curious about. What, you know, what advancements we're going to see in quantum computing over the next year, I think there's going to be quite a bit, and then also just kind of how this clarity, you know, the Everest, the holy grail right now of crypto and the clarity of regulations, how is that going to affect things? And, I mean, honestly, I just love to see what people are going to build. I mean, what they're going to build in the next, what people are going to build in the next year is going to shock us and surprise us, and I can't even guess what's going to be invented or created next.
00:54:21.642 - 00:55:12.940, Speaker A: Yeah, I am truly excited about that as well. Having that clarity is definitely helpful for the entire industry. But even outside of that, typically it's the bear markets that highlight the builders that build throughout the bear market are typically the ones that come on, are able to climb the hill and during the bull markets, be the champions of that kind of bull run. And I'm optimistic as we've talked about, that the infrastructure is now kind of laid. Applications are getting to the point where they are usable. We can start to compose together, make some interesting apps, and also have a pretty user experience so that we can actually kind of go from the small niche industry that we are, in terms of users to hopefully hundreds of millions this next bull market. And all we need is one killer app.
00:55:12.940 - 00:55:20.944, Speaker A: And then, like you said, I think our parents, our friends, our family will be like, ah, I know that app. I can use it.
00:55:21.092 - 00:56:13.928, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's gonna be a moment and it's gonna happen and we're all gonna be, I think, a little bit jaded at first and trying to figure out, like, is this really the moment? And then, you know, we're gonna, we're gonna look back and go, okay, yeah, this is the moment. This is where this is happening. Like, people now, you know, everyone knows how to use, how to use crypto, you know, that's gonna be the moment when my mom stops asking me what, what I do for my job, you know, and it's going to happen, and we're all going to be surprised because we've been waiting for it for so long, but. And then it's just going to be no turning back, and, you know, it's going to be. It's going to be everywhere and it's going to be integrated into everything. And, you know, 1015 years from now, like, our kids are, like, my kids are pretty young. They're still in elementary school and middle school.
00:56:13.928 - 00:56:45.642, Speaker B: And so, you know, they've grown up knowing what crypto is and they've grown up with it, and it's just going to be a given. And, you know, when they're adults, it's. It's going to be everywhere, and we're going to go back and say, like, oh, we were there. It was, you know, it was march of this year, and this thing happened and, you know, it all took off and the rest is history. And who knows when that's going to be? But, you know, I do think it's going to come and it's going to surprise us all because it's probably going to not be something we expect.
00:56:45.786 - 00:57:00.470, Speaker A: I do agree. I do agree. Well, Sadie, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I've really enjoyed the conversation. For those that want to find out more about either you or follow you on social media or learn about the firm, what is the best way to do that?
00:57:01.370 - 00:57:23.382, Speaker B: LinkedIn is probably the best way to find me. You know, we obviously have a company website, but LinkedIn's the best way to find us. We don't post a lot on Twitter, read a lot on Twitter, but, you know, we don't put much content on there. But, you know, people can always reach out to me on LinkedIn, you know, or if I'm speaking at a conference or something. I'm always happy to chat with people.
00:57:23.526 - 00:57:30.214, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, thank you again for coming on the podcast. It was a really fun conversation. I wish you and the firm all the best.
00:57:30.302 - 00:57:31.726, Speaker B: Thanks. Thanks for having me. I enjoyed it.
00:57:31.758 - 00:57:31.950, Speaker A: Thank you.
