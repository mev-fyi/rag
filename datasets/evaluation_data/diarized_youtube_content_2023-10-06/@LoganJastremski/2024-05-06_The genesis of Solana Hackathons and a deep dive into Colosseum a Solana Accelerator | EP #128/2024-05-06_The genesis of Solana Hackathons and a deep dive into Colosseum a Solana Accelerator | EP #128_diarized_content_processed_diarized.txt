00:00:00.120 - 00:00:24.462, Speaker A: We've tried to map out that whole journey, basically, from learning about the hackathon to bringing on chain activity. And so we run hackathons in a very different way than traditional hackathons. So you mentioned, like, youth global events. They're in person. They're over the course of, like, two or three days. You drink a bunch of Red Bull, and it's a very ephemeral experience. Very few people go to these competitions to, like, start a company.
00:00:24.462 - 00:00:52.060, Speaker A: They go because they want to experiment with, like, you know, the bounties that are available. Companies will come in and they put, like, you know, we'll pay $10,000 for the best team who integrates with, like, Aave or uniswap or whatever. But it's like. It's not like people coming in with their own creative ideas and, like, building what they want to build for the next five to ten years. And so, structurally, just like Solana, hackathons are much more about that. It's much more about, like, startup creation and people bringing their own ideas. There's no.
00:00:54.490 - 00:00:55.538, Speaker B: Maddie. Thank you.
00:00:55.634 - 00:00:57.026, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:00:57.098 - 00:01:23.706, Speaker B: Appreciate you inviting me into your home and excited to do this. I feel like before we jump into things, I'm excited just about the Miami crew. I think we were both in the bay, but during COVID spread our wings and came to Miami, and there's been a good group of people here, and it's been awesome just to see the community, especially on the crypto side, come together.
00:01:23.898 - 00:01:43.870, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's been awesome living here, honestly, I didn't move here to meet a bunch of crypto people. There was way more crypto people in the Bay area, but it's been nice to see folks move out here and, yeah, I think as time goes on, more people will realize how cool Miami is.
00:01:45.050 - 00:01:50.268, Speaker B: I've heard on Twitter that we're pushing Miami to be the Singapore of us. Are you on board?
00:01:50.394 - 00:02:11.320, Speaker A: I'm fully on board with that. No, I think it will. I mean, it's just. It's interesting to see how it's being developed and how, like, the governance works here versus, like, in California, where I've lived a lot of my life. And so, yeah, I mean, there's pros and cons, but I think, you know, Miami is definitely the Singapore of the US.
00:02:11.440 - 00:02:17.258, Speaker B: I'm worth it. So I think it's just a cool city. I appreciate that people can disagree and still be friends.
00:02:17.384 - 00:02:17.782, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:17.846 - 00:02:51.560, Speaker B: Where I felt like in California, it was a little bit harder, but anyways, yeah, I very much appreciate you coming on the podcast. Been looking forward to this. I think you have a very unique kind of career journey where you have taken, what I would say, larger risk at the time. In hindsight, it always seems easy to make those jumps. But I would love to start, before we dive into what you're doing today with Coliseum, how you kind of ended up within crypto and what was kind of your career journey like up until.
00:02:51.600 - 00:03:44.740, Speaker A: This point, for sure. So I think my journey starts in college. So I was studying economics, and I was taking a bunch of macroeconomics classes, and I didn't actually know how things like central banking worked, how interest rate policy works. And I was just pretty blown away when I started to learn sort of the intricacies of how the system currently works. And so had some friends in college that were also kind of like quasi libertarian, really into Mises and Hayek. And so I would talk with them late at night about kind of different philosophies around that. And at the same time, there were some kids in my dorm room that were mining bitcoin, and this was like 2011, 2012.
00:03:44.740 - 00:04:25.874, Speaker A: And I thought that was really interesting. And then I thought it was even more interesting when the administration basically came into the room and shut it down because it was using so much power from the buildings. And so I just started talking to them about it. And honestly, just as the more I learned about it and the philosophical backing of why bitcoin was created in the first place really just sent me down the rabbit hole. And I've really never got out since then. And so a lot of my experience early on was just with bitcoin. And so I wrote my undergraduate thesis in college about bitcoin.
00:04:26.002 - 00:04:27.218, Speaker B: You and Olaf both?
00:04:27.314 - 00:04:57.414, Speaker A: Yeah. In fact, like, at the time when I was writing it, you know, you have to use, like, references of, you know, other academic work. But at the time, there was no other academic work about it. There was just bitcoin talk forums. And so a lot of my references were that. But Olaf was, like, one of the few academic papers that I could find that was written a couple years before I did it. And so anyway, yeah, on the paper was actually about something that was interesting at the time.
00:04:57.414 - 00:05:22.810, Speaker A: Have you heard of this mining pool called Ghash IO? So one of the things that I thought was really interesting and a risk for bitcoin was sort of like the centralization of mining at the time, where there was this mining pool called Ghash IO, and it was getting close to about 50% of the total hash rate of the network. So there was this risk? It's like, what if it goes over 50%? Could the operators of the pool basically.
00:05:22.890 - 00:05:24.474, Speaker B: Like, do a double spend, do a.
00:05:24.482 - 00:06:28.660, Speaker A: Double spend, do something to mess up with the network? And so something interesting that happened was that as it was getting closer to 50%, people then kind of like elected to move to different pools in a very short order. And so it sort of decentralized the network in a sense, again. And so I thought that phenomenon was really interesting and sort of like one of the moments of bitcoin where I thought, wow, this is something that could persists long term, amongst other things that happened over time. But anyway, that's kind of my journey into crypto, was learning about bitcoin in college, going to bitcoin meetups. And then at the time I was looking, I was like, what do I want to do for my job? In my junior year, I had an internship at Google, and so I had been introduced to the tech world. I was thinking, should I work in tech? But I'm really interested in crypto, which is kind of like a very weird version of the industry at the time. And there really wasn't any crypto companies other than Coinbase had just started up in 2012.
00:06:28.660 - 00:07:10.740, Speaker A: And so I sent them my thesis and I didn't get the job there, but still was trying to figure out what to do. And then I knew I wanted to kind of work in financial tech somehow sort of related to, to crypto. And so I had a job at square. This is where I actually met on the first day on the same team, my co founder, Clay, who was also at square. And so we worked there actually together for several years. But the whole time we were just at the lunch table talking about bitcoin and crypto. But then through that period, I kept going to bitcoin meetups.
00:07:10.740 - 00:08:16.566, Speaker A: And there was this guy named Vitalik who had read about, he was pretty prolific on Bitcoin talk forums, and he had his own bitcoin blog, and he was actually a really good writer, even when he was really young. And he was coming to a bitcoin meetup to talk about Ethereum, which he was working to launch. I went to that meetup in San Francisco and thought it was an interesting thing at the time, basically, anything that wasn't bitcoin was basically vaporware. Um, and so got pretty into Ethereum, uh, after that and followed it all the way up until launch. And then obviously, 2017 rolled around and like ICO mania, just public perception about crypto generally really started to take off. And I thought okay, well, um, now that there's, like, actual, like, protocols and projects actually, that are like, somewhat legitimate launching on Ethereum, I should probably get involved in the industry. And also at the time, I could bring something to the table rather than just being some college kid.
00:08:16.566 - 00:08:51.732, Speaker A: I had been at square. I had learned some skills, specifically around growth marketing. I joined a project also with Clay. We jumped basically at the same time from square to join this project called Zero X, which is one of the first dexs on Ethereum, or Dex protocols. And that was an interesting experience, just because I kind of had the front row seat to the beginnings of DeFi. In fact, I was in the telegram group that basically came up with the term Defi. It was like open finance versus DeFi.
00:08:51.796 - 00:08:54.484, Speaker B: Who was it? It was Brendan.
00:08:54.612 - 00:09:31.052, Speaker A: It was Blake Henderson, who was on the xerox team, and Brendan from Dharma, a couple guys from this protocol. I forget what it's called, but it was like you could bundle tokens together. Set protocol, set protocol. And I think there was one or two other projects. Anyway, there was this. Then they were all in San Francisco, and it was all within everyone's office, was in the financial district, basically, of San Francisco, or Soma. Yeah, I remember the beginnings of that.
00:09:31.052 - 00:10:12.380, Speaker A: That was right when I joined. And what was interesting about that was, though, was that I was really interested in the model of order books. And I thought that Xerox had an interesting implementation around that. But it turned out over the course of the next few years that I worked there, that amms were the ones that really, really took off. And I thought that was interesting because fundamentally, I still believe that order books are a better system for price discovery of assets. But nonetheless, UniSoc was just blowing up just in terms of volume. And Steven, today it's one of the top Dex protocols.
00:10:12.380 - 00:11:21.616, Speaker A: But what I noticed is that Ethereum was not scaling to allow things like order books, and projects like Uniswap basically evolved its protocol around almost the deficiencies of how scalable Ethereum, or EVM was at the time. And so I thought that was interesting, just strategically how they approached that, but also that it was becoming clear through. And then things like, there was obviously talks around, like, side chains and L2s, and when was sharding going to come? At the time, this was like, in 2019 ish. And it would just. That wasn't adding up to me, to be honest. And, you know, I thought, you know, and I still think today is like, people, founders don't really think in terms of, like, ten years, in terms of, like, technical roadmaps, they need to find, like, product market fit today and or, you know, yesterday in a lot of cases. And so I just thought, like, you know, maybe there's a different model here besides Ethereum.
00:11:21.616 - 00:11:58.780, Speaker A: And so that kind of led into, obviously, like, the Defi summer. And then I got reached out to by Raj Gokul and some recruiters at Solana Labs. They had just kind of gone to mainnet. I had heard about Solana, but honestly, I didn't, like, know the intricacies, other than I thought it was sort of a ridiculous benchmark that they kept claiming for years, which was like, 75,000 transactions per second. And I was like, yeah, whatever. That sounds like crazy. But then the network came to market and pretty much was living up to what they were claiming.
00:11:58.780 - 00:12:14.088, Speaker A: And there were other obviously high performance blockchains at the time that were sort of getting rolled out. And, yeah, met with the team at Slana Labs, met Anatoly, and, yeah, then I decided to jump from Xerox there.
00:12:14.184 - 00:12:19.352, Speaker B: So there's a lot in there. You were actually the one that first put me onto Solana.
00:12:19.456 - 00:12:20.100, Speaker A: Really?
00:12:21.140 - 00:12:53.762, Speaker B: I can't remember the exact tweet, but it was after you left Zero X. And I think it was about tweeting something along the lines of single thread execution versus parallel processing or along the lines of multicore performance. You kept tweeting about this. I think it was in Defi summer or just there afterwards. I was like, what is he tweeting about? You actually inspired me to look into Solana and deep dive it a little bit more. So thank you.
00:12:53.866 - 00:13:02.898, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah. I mean, surprised I was even on your radar back then. I didn't have any followers I knew.
00:13:03.034 - 00:13:44.870, Speaker B: So, like Brendan, I actually was able to connect with San Francisco. I went to the Ethereum hackathon in 2018 that was held in San Francisco. And I met Will, the founder of Xerox, and a couple others, because I was also trying to figure out, like, this crypto thing was really cool. I thought Ethereum was. I didn't get in as early as you, and so I thought most of crypto was a Ponzi throughout 2017. And then when I really started to dive in, I was like, okay, this is really cool. Kind of fomo ed the top, but was very excited about it and kept with it through the bear market and got to meet similar people in the industry.
00:13:44.870 - 00:13:58.270, Speaker B: But I think I was just a couple years behind you and had to take a little bit more securitis route. But I actually applied to Coinbase as well, didn't get in, but I think maybe it served us well.
00:13:58.690 - 00:14:20.322, Speaker A: Maybe, I don't know. A lot of interesting people were part of that early Coinbase team. I don't know how things would have turned out, but obviously I'm happy how they turned out so far. Yeah, Coinbase has obviously been like a great institution, I would say, in our.
00:14:20.346 - 00:14:53.056, Speaker B: Industry, 100%, especially with all the other nefarious things that often get thrown our way. So maybe if we could dive before jumping into Coliseum. And what you're doing today, can you just dive quickly or as much depth as you would like into kind of your role at Solana? What got you excited about that Solana particular ecosystem, outside of doing any of the other things that you could have potentially done after Zero X?
00:14:53.208 - 00:16:10.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one benefit of just being in crypto quite a while, I guess, since 2012, is that I've just gotten really impatient with the progress of development and basically adoption. I'm always just have been looking for where in crypto is pushing the boundaries of where mainstream adoption is going to come from. I think Solana, I had a feeling in 2020 that that was going to be where a lot of the adoption was going to come from. From one of the things that you said, which is parallel execution, a lot of the technical trade offs that they made. Yeah, I basically joined as their head of growth. And so what I did at Solana Labs initially, but then gradually transitioned to Solana foundation in the last couple years, which was there's basically this awesome tech, and we think it's ten x, 100 x, better than whatever was going on in the EVM or other next gen blockchains. And so there's some independent developers and validators that are really interested in the protocol, and that was, you know, well, before that I was there.
00:16:10.980 - 00:17:05.861, Speaker A: But, like, how do we get, like, core parts of the Solana ecosystem together, and then how do we honestly, like, scalably bring in a lot of, like, developers, but specifically, like, startup founders who are technical, they can build actually, like, products and applications on the network. And so a lot of the work early on that I did was sort of helping try to find some of the core parts of the ecosystem. So, for instance, when I, I joined, there was just one wallet. It was not even run by a full time team. It was called Solit. It was functional, but you needed a really first class flagship wallet in order to get all the applications on the network long term. Luckily, I had been working with Chris, Francesco and Brandon, who are the founders of Phantom.
00:17:05.861 - 00:18:04.002, Speaker A: They worked with me at Zero X, and they were looking, they hate metamask because they had been engineers at zero X dealing with Metamask all the time, and they just couldn't stand it. So they were going to create a competitor, and they were trying to figure out, I think at the time when they talked to me about it, they were trying to figure out what ecosystem to build it in. Luckily got them introduced to Raj and the team, and the rest is history there. Yeah, the early on stuff was just trying to find, how do we just non scalably find the right people to build core parts of the infrastructure? But then this is kind of where the hackathons come from and what we're doing with coliseum long term. Here is the online hackathons. So the story with that and kind of how I started that program was their wormhole was being developed. The thought was, it's really hard to get developers to come into crypto generally.
00:18:04.002 - 00:18:51.030, Speaker A: You have to convince them of all these ideological things. And so what are some systems that connect current ecosystems, like Ethereum, and bring maybe developers from those ecosystems onto Solana? And so wormhole was about to be released, and so we were like, let's run a hackathon or something to get people using this technology. So we called it the wormhole hackathon. We had everything set up. It was going to be run more like a traditional hackathon, except because it was in the middle of COVID or the beginnings of COVID it was going to be online. And so we were just going to run it like a normal hackathon and make it specifically about wormhole, where the requirements would be like, oh, you have to use wormhole to actually build your project. And so it never released, though, in time.
00:18:51.030 - 00:19:17.200, Speaker A: And so we were like, well, let's just run an open ended, sort of like bring, you know, use whatever technology you want. And there was some worry about that at the time because, you know, the chewing glass meme was not even a meme at that point. It was just like glass. It was just like there was no developer, very little developer tooling. It was extremely hard to build on the protocol at the time. And so we're just like, let's just see what happens. And, you know, the first hackathon, we got like 60 product submissions.
00:19:17.200 - 00:20:01.580, Speaker A: And so that was a huge amount at the time. And we were just like, wow, this could be the way to scalably help stimulate developer activity in the ecosystem. And so over time, we've just doubled and tripled down on that program. And ultimately, obviously with Coliseum, this is my full time thing. Now, over time, basically, I did a lot of things at both the labs and foundation. But over, given that, I think when we ran the numbers recently, about 80% of all vc backed startups started in the online hackathons. It just became clear this was what was being the most impactful for the ecosystem.
00:20:01.580 - 00:20:07.788, Speaker A: And so, yeah, that's kind of what I was doing mostly for the last couple of years.
00:20:07.924 - 00:21:11.862, Speaker B: It's a pretty amazing journey because looking back now, to me, the thing that really held Solana together through both the ups and the downs were the hackathons. And to me, it's a very clear playbook that's tried and true, at least in my opinion, for other ecosystems to really emulate. And I feel like maybe I'm either not as plugged in or just not aware, but that magic that Solana has captured in those hackathons really hasn't been recreated. I'm not sure why, but I think what Solana and you guys did at foundation was really the core of thing that built the community. And I think even in the early Ethereum days when I went to East San Francisco in 2019, that I was like, okay, this is a real thing. We're all on Twitter or accent it seems kind of real. We all shitposts and dunk on each other and laugh, but being in person, it's different, even like these podcasts.
00:21:11.862 - 00:21:25.904, Speaker B: And so I really think that that was something special, and I think I'm glad that Coliseum is continuing to do something along that vein because it really, I think, pushed the entire industry forward.
00:21:26.032 - 00:21:39.992, Speaker A: Yeah, we could probably do a whole podcast around. Like, what the differences between, when I say hackathon versus traditional hackathons and, like, what we've done differently. And so do you want to dig into that? I don't think I've ever digged into it.
00:21:40.016 - 00:21:41.900, Speaker B: Like, maybe. Yeah, if you want to.
00:21:42.730 - 00:22:40.468, Speaker A: So. Well, first of all, before I even jump into, like, what we've done strategically with hackathons is that, like, there's only one Solana. This only works if you have extreme product market fit as, like, the product itself, which is the l one, in this case with developers, which is the target audience. And so, you know, there's a, there's a whole, there's a whole bunch of people basically in Silicon Valley who are called growth hackers, or there's other terms for those growth teams. And it's separate from traditional marketing organizations. At big tech companies, these teams actually have established a bunch of tactics about how to find basically these channels or programs that contribute most of the growth to these organizations. And it's a process of iteration and experimentation with different channels.
00:22:40.468 - 00:23:51.986, Speaker A: But it turns out that about, you know, there's a power law distribution of channels that work way better than others. And so one framework of thinking about what we've done with the hackathons is trying to find, like, what is the sort of Pareto distribution, the power law distribution channel that is attributing most of the activity, or at least acquiring the most, basically developers and specifically startup founders. And so we've sort of modeled the hackathon to be that funnel, because when you think about trying to market a blockchain, the first thing you need is like data to measure if you're doing anything correctly with your marketing channels. But an l one blockchain is just an open source GitHub, repo. So how do you know who signs up for your account, how much time they spend, et cetera, et cetera. You need some, I don't say a layer of friction, but some way of figuring out where people came from, getting their information to know what they've done, and then ultimately what they're doing on the protocol. And so actually, the hackathon is sort of set up to be that sort of funnel where we can track people, where they come from, their information.
00:23:51.986 - 00:24:29.936, Speaker A: Once they signed in, did they convert to actually build a six week hackathon project? And then ultimately did they go on later to raise venture funding and bring on chain usage? Basically. And so we've tried to map out that whole journey, basically, from learning about the hackathon to bringing on chain activity. And so we run hackathons in a very different way than traditional hackathons. So you mentioned the eth global events. They're in person, they're over the course of two or three days. You drink a bunch of Red Bull, and it's a very ephemeral experience. Very few people go to these competitions to start a company.
00:24:29.936 - 00:25:06.310, Speaker A: They go because they want to experiment with the bounties that are available. Companies will come in and they'll pay $10,000 for the best team who integrates with Aave or uniswap or whatever. But it's not people coming in with their own creative ideas and building what they want to build for the next five to ten years. Structurally, just like Solana, hackathons are much more about that. It's much more about startup creation and people bringing their own ideas. There's no bounties. For instance, in our current hackathon renaissance, we just have six broad categories, defi, deepin, infra gaming, et cetera.
00:25:06.310 - 00:25:53.916, Speaker A: And then we say to teams who want to contribute specific sponsors to have specific things built, we just say, hey, it's not really part of the official prize tracks. You can throw up a side prize, we'll promote it, but it's not really what we're specifically focused on here. And so, yeah, just overall. And also we don't need to get into the details because this is a little bit private, but the marketing channels that we use to attract people into the hackathon is also very different than, I think, what others have done. And so this is actually a very old idea that we're trying to bring back. Wherever there's been startup competitions in the past, the original Nobel prizes were kind of around this. Napoleon had this thing called the Volta prize.
00:25:53.916 - 00:26:32.980, Speaker A: This is where Alexander Graham Bell won his prize for the first telephone and built bell Labs. Coming out of this competition, even going back to roman times, there was guilds versus patrons. There's different models of funding innovation over history. And right now it's more the patronage model where you have a VC fund and they have specific things that they want to see build, or people come to them and they fund that specific thing versus opening just a global competition. Bring whatever you think is interesting to build. We'll hold this global competition and then help support and fund teams that way. So it's just a different model.
00:26:33.280 - 00:27:05.150, Speaker B: It's kind of just like applying Silicon Valley's best practices that we've learned in web two to web3. It's, I think because of maybe the anarchist or like anti government, like initial, like crypto community that kind of got created with bitcoin, and I think in some part with Ethereum too, really looking to, like Big Brother bitcoin. Some of these maybe best practices were neglected a little bit.
00:27:05.810 - 00:27:32.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's possible also. It's just like. I don't know. I think crypto has appealed to people that are a little bit more technical at their heart. There's not that, actually, many growth marketers in crypto even today, partly because the product market fit is not great, and you need product market fit to even utilize the services of someone like a growth marketer. They're not going to find product market fit for you. So I think that's one.
00:27:32.420 - 00:27:36.044, Speaker B: You mean if you give tokens to everybody, it doesn't work?
00:27:36.132 - 00:28:04.530, Speaker A: Doesn't work. They have to be retained without the incentives. So I think that's the biggest thing, but I think that'll change over time. Is more products now, I think we're going, thanks to Solana and other high throughput blockchains, I think we're going from more of the infrastructure stage to the application stage, which I know you've talked about and others have, too. And so I think as these applications start to grow and get product market fit, I think that's where a lot of these people are going to come into the industry.
00:28:04.650 - 00:29:11.698, Speaker B: Yeah, I fully align there. I think what I'm excited about, and I think both were a unique point in time because Solana particularly has really been battle tested, not only the community side, but the technical side. And I think many of the challenges kind of on the community aspect got really tested, I would say post FTX. And I think it took the community a little bit of time to find its footing, but it's, it's definitely found its footing now and then on the technical side, continuing to iterate on kind of the stress tests of the network. And now we are going into more application focused developers being able to not focus on just infrastructure because of the limitations of infrastructure. And I think that's where I'm really excited about just at this point in time, where we are in history. In 2024, we're finally, in my opinion, getting blockchain applications that can potentially scale to mass adoption.
00:29:11.698 - 00:29:22.258, Speaker B: Yes. So maybe shifting a little bit, appreciate all the background context. Tell us why Colosseum and why specifically Solana?
00:29:22.434 - 00:30:01.216, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. The second question, why Solana? Again, it just goes back to, I fundamentally believe that Solana is kind of the technology that is going to help us push crypto into the global mainstream adoption. And so I think that's where I want to spend my time. That's where I've been spending my time the last four years. And so nothing really around that thesis has changed. In fact, it's strengthened. And so I think in terms of why coliseum? Well, I think one thing that we've learned from running these hackathons is that there's sort of like two problems.
00:30:01.216 - 00:30:43.118, Speaker A: While they've been successful, there's still an opportunity, basically pre hackathon to help with startup formation. With Coliseum, we've actually built this product that allows people to find their co founders. There's this co founder matching platform on coliseum.org, comma, and then also a place to discuss product ideas. There's this pre startup flow that needs to happen in the ecosystem where people are finding potential co founders. They're discussing ideas even before they're going on their engineering sprint, which is the hackathon and so there was an opportunity to build out that product. So we did that also, a product to just run the hackathons the way that we wanted to.
00:30:43.118 - 00:31:56.784, Speaker A: And so this platform also allows us, unlike kind of off the shelf solutions, to run it in the way that we do. Because again, as I was saying before, we run it very differently than a traditional hackathon. And then one thing that we've seen with hackathons is that there's all these like this pool of talent from around the world. They want to start startups, but then it takes them a while to convince like seed or pre seed level investors to invest in them, especially now. You need to at least get to Mainnet, you probably need some users, there needs to be some on our work besides just like a five to six week hackathon project. And so we felt that though, that we had enough data on who these builders were based on their interactions with us in previous hackathons, in the hackathon itself, we could see how well they worked together, sprint on a particular product idea, that we felt comfortable that we could support them right after a hackathon, or at least the top ten to 15 best teams coming out of each hackathon. And so we've spun up this accelerator to basically choose out of the pool of winners, ten to 15 teams, like I said, that will get venture funding from our venture fund that we've raised and help them basically onboard into the Solana ecosystem and then ultimately raise pre seed and seed funding.
00:31:56.892 - 00:32:31.492, Speaker B: Yeah, that's amazing. I think it kind of reminds me a little bit of why combinator with helping early stage companies, giving them funding, getting them connected to other vc's in the ecosystem, and really creating that pipeline, and especially if Solana, I think, is going to do what we believe it will, then directionally, I think it's a very, um, advantageous model to build at this point in time, with the ecosystem becoming slightly more robust.
00:32:31.636 - 00:33:34.166, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, yeah, we've heard some comparisons to YC a lot since we launched. I think, um, one of our theses is that, um, one, there will only be one YC ever. Um, it's kind of in a league of its own and it's doing its own thing. We want to take kind of a different path, forge our own kind of direction. Um, but one thesis we have is that, let's say Y combinator, instead of just running this sort of college style written application, where they sort of evaluate teams based on that, and then do this interview, what if they accepted teams and then watched them build through the first six weeks of the Y combinator program, we feel that they would make very, very different decisions on who to support based on how actually, like in a time box, a competitive real life environment, how well these teams are executing on a product vision. And so that's what we're doing basically with the hackathon where we're sort of like front loading that that is the application. Let's see what you can actually build during the course of an engineering sprint.
00:33:34.166 - 00:34:06.578, Speaker A: That is our hackathons and that's how we decide who to underwrite and support as part of coming into the ecosystem. So that's like proof of work. Proof of work. One pretty big difference. The other thing is, yeah, more about just sort of building an actual platform to help with startup formation. There's components of this that YC does, but we sort of want to open that up to basically everyone in crypto that wants to start a startup. And so we think over time we spend a lot of resources on product development.
00:34:06.578 - 00:35:05.620, Speaker A: Our third co founder, Nate was a backend engineer for many years at Stripe and he's built out this whole product and he still spends a lot of time on it. And so we think that will evolve over time to help with startup formation in crypto. And so I think this is another thing that is not necessarily bad. I think it's good that VC's have different strategies on attracting people and funding people. We just think that there's this third or fourth strategy where instead of hiring an army of associates or creating a bunch of content or running or using your own personal network, which are all very viable strategies that have worked over time, we just think that there's this other strategy of running this global competition through this product that we've built to attract the world's best into crypto specifically. And so that's sort of our mission.
00:35:05.960 - 00:36:55.444, Speaker B: I love it. I think it's very much needed, to be honest. I think the investing style of getting to see how the engineers or teams come together for the first six months and then really using that as a testing or battleground, I really like, I think everybody has their kind of own investing style and different ways to attract different people. But I think this in large part will be very beneficial to the entire community because you guys are creating that top of the funnel really for globally and giving teams enough funding to really go and further iterate on their mvp, possibly get to Mainnet or if they're already on Mainnet, refine their product, build that pipeline of other vc's, other networking, other founders in the ecosystem that have really forged that path, because I think what we really all want is blockchain technology more broadly to get into the hands of as many people as possible. I think you and I very much agree Itai in terms of Solana being really at the forefront enabling that. And now that that infrastructure and groundwork has been laid out, really doubling down on the application engineers that will get this technology into as many people's hands, because I think some of the early products that we have now seen are really cool, particularly within deepen helium. Hivemapper again, order books.
00:36:55.444 - 00:37:12.114, Speaker B: Phoenix workout was really a contributor to the slana ecosystem. There's a lot of people that have added tremendous value, and if we can accelerate that or pour gasoline, so to speak, on that, I think it's a worthwhile endeavor.
00:37:12.202 - 00:38:01.442, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. I think one thing that's a little bit controversial, at least historically, about the hackathons, is I think generally people have enjoyed them and found value out of them, and that's great. But I think I have this thesis that we just need, like, an order of magnitude more founders that are really high quality, building startups and experimenting versus, like, you know, spending a lot of time putting a lot of support into current ecosystem teams. Like, and the reason for that is, like, I think some organizations like the Solana foundation and others should support current ecosystem teams. But I think generally we just want a ton more competition because competition will breed better products downstream for actual users, and that's actually what's going to grow the ecosystem. I agree. Yeah, that's what we're trying to do.
00:38:01.442 - 00:38:04.178, Speaker A: We're just trying to bring a lot more high quality founders in the ecosystem.
00:38:04.274 - 00:38:31.064, Speaker B: I love it. And again, I very much appreciate you and Coliseum for putting this forth, because honestly, I really do think the hackathons were the glue that held everybody together and accelerated the Solana ecosystem. When other ecosystems have really had a hard time finding their footing, I think it's a very interesting model and I think it's going to be very beneficial for everybody in the ecosystem.
00:38:31.152 - 00:38:32.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I hope so.
00:38:32.600 - 00:38:53.348, Speaker B: So maybe if you could dive a little bit more into the exact specifics. Someone comes to you, Maddie, and says, hey, I'm interested in Colosseum. I live in India or Africa and I want to get my feet wet. I think Solano is cool. How do I go about that process and getting involved?
00:38:53.484 - 00:39:26.272, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the first step is sign up for a coliseum.org account and then try to find someone who's another builder on the platform. There's a system for searching for people in your area or specific skill set that if you don't know anyone to go through this journey with you, it's helpful to find someone. And so try to find at least one person to join a hackathon with. And initially, ultimately, you probably won't be a winner in that hackathon. It will just be sort of a learning experience.
00:39:26.272 - 00:39:46.680, Speaker A: What a lot of people use traditional hackathons for is experiment with the technology. And so that would be my first recommendation, is just sort of participate, find your people, try to find a cool idea to work on. And then that's when you sort of look back and you say, okay, like one, do I want to be a founder? A lot of people don't want to be a founder.
00:39:47.060 - 00:39:50.372, Speaker B: Or on the flip side, they want to be a founder, but don't know how hard it is.
00:39:50.436 - 00:40:40.682, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. It's really, really rough. It's a rough life. And so a lot of people who join the hackathons just decide, like, oh, I want to work for an ecosystem company. And so we have this pipeline of people going to apply for jobs, which is also great, but the people who want to actually start a company, this is the time to really start thinking about what products are important to you that would solve problems for you and how to use crypto to solve that. And that's when you sort of go through, I think Balaji came up with this phrase of the IDMas of just trying to experiment with different technologies, get initial customer feedback, see what people want, how it relates to what you want, and then that's when you start entering the next hackathon, apply, try to find a full time co founder, see if you win. If it doesn't happen, no problem, just keep going at it.
00:40:40.682 - 00:41:30.392, Speaker A: And so that's what we see a lot with a lot of the best teams, actually, is that they participate in multiple hackathons. I think the classic example of this is tensor. They entered three different hackathons with three different products, all kind of within the NFT space, but still very different before they landed on what most people know of tensor today. And this has happened over and over and over and over again that we've seen. And so I think that's just one thing that also I think all VC's and people generally want to see before they give folks money and commit to them, is that have you kind of gone through the process of committing to this project or this technology? And have you been building and have you been just trying for an extended period of time. So endurance is really important. That's something we definitely look for.
00:41:30.392 - 00:41:31.700, Speaker A: And what do we recommend?
00:41:32.040 - 00:41:48.136, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of like, can you suffer or get knocked down and get back up? Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you can also relate to this. Starting a fund and getting off that off the ground is no easy feat. And I would very much consider us founders as well.
00:41:48.248 - 00:42:07.322, Speaker A: Yeah, no, for sure. I mean, I think for us, we started raising our fund around when Solana hit $8, and so, yeah, it's. It's been a, it's been a wild ride, but I think, yeah, also, props to you guys of being, like, you know, one of the few funds that have, like, stuck with Solana through the.
00:42:07.346 - 00:42:09.154, Speaker B: Whole thing, there was probably less than five.
00:42:09.242 - 00:42:13.802, Speaker A: Yeah, probably less than five funds. And actually, there's probably a lot of funds claiming that they did, but actually.
00:42:13.866 - 00:42:14.922, Speaker B: There definitely are now.
00:42:15.026 - 00:42:46.378, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But, yeah, you guys truly did. And so, yeah, I think, you know, thanks for you guys for sticking with the whole thing and, yeah, all the builders to stick through the whole thing, I mean, that's. That's been really tough. I mean, you say, like, the hackathons have glued it together, but honestly, like, I think, like, the existing ecosystem projects were a lot of the ones who held it together and just, like, fought through this bear market and obviously are coming out the odds on the other side much, much stronger. But it was not easy for a while.
00:42:46.514 - 00:43:24.778, Speaker B: No, I mean, maybe for being in crypto, as long as you have, you've seen the ups and downs of the industry. What do you kind of see? What would your advice be to founders? When you get knocked down, it's not if, but when. How do you kind of stomach the ups and downs? Because personally, the lows are low and the highs are high and kind of keeping an even keel. And this is something even I'm trying to do better at as well, because the downs can be hard and the highs can be high, and just making sure that you're even keel as much as possible.
00:43:24.954 - 00:44:44.810, Speaker A: I mean, it's really hard. And probably, you know, I think it starts with, at least from the founder perspective, like, start with an idea that you truly are passionate and care about. I think one thing that you will see a lot in crypto is, like, people trying to choose other people's ideas or not other people's ideas, but just ideas that they think sound good or that have a big tam or I, you know, think have a narrative that they can raise money around. We see a lot of modular, like, whatever you want to throw out there is the kind of the phrase of the day, but, you know, that's like choosing something like a problem that really affects you, that you're passionate about, that you find, you know, 100 other people to be your first customers that they're passionate about in the same way that you are, is really kind of the core of, like, how you're going to stick through the tough times. Also finding co founders and people that are there to support you through both the highs. Like, right now, I think one of the worries also is just, like, people are losing focus because, like, meme coins are running and there's insane market activity around the bitcoin ETF. And I think, you know, just having a partner or set of partners that, you know, can, can ground you both during the bad times and the good times is really important.
00:44:44.810 - 00:45:37.610, Speaker A: But for me, I mean, even for me, it's been. I haven't even been a founder. I guess I'm kind of technically one right now. But just going through the volatility of crypto has been quite difficult. And I think just an analogy of when I've talked to people in tradfi, they've gone through these market cycles, and maybe they go through a couple throughout the course of their entire life, and it's a great learning experience for them, but it's over the entire lifetime versus in crypto, it's just like back to back to back every four years. It's just, I mean, which is good, because maybe it's like teaching all of us something about the nature of financial markets and the nature of the industry that we work in. But on the other hand, yeah, you really have to be.
00:45:37.610 - 00:45:45.768, Speaker A: Yeah. Be willing to suffer some pain, but I guess that's anything with life. You have to go through some growing pains.
00:45:45.864 - 00:45:55.072, Speaker B: Yeah. I think, personally, I didn't realize how hard it was until you kind of come through the darkness and then start to see the light at the end.
00:45:55.096 - 00:45:56.984, Speaker A: Of the tunnel, which makes it more sweet.
00:45:57.072 - 00:46:25.822, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it is hard. And so, yeah, I would echo all those statements. Is there anything in particular, though, now that kind of Solana ecosystem is emerging from the ashes, so to speak, is there any particular projects that you're just personally excited about, whether pre existing or just new ideas that you would love to see contribute to the ecosystem?
00:46:25.926 - 00:47:01.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's a ton of interesting things in crypto right now. I think some things that I'm particularly interested in are more. Yeah. Around. And why we run the hackathons is like, where's the sort of true. And the Peter Thiel sends zero to one innovation. And I think one interesting project we've actually issued a proposal to invest in them, is called the metadow, which is sort of, you know, there's a lot of abstract ways to talk about, you know, solving human coordination problems.
00:47:01.016 - 00:47:36.972, Speaker A: And I think we got lost to that in, in crypto quite a bit. But the tactical problem is Dao governance doesn't really work. The one vote per token thing doesn't seem to work. It's sort of decentralization theater, as far as I can tell so far. But there's a lot of promise with Daos long term. And so what is a better governance mechanism? And so there's this concept, this futarchy, that was developed by this economist named Robin Hanson, and no one's really put it into practice. And that's like, what's amazing about crypto.
00:47:36.972 - 00:48:23.316, Speaker A: I'm surprised there's just not a ton of economists and academics around the world trying to put their theories into practice. But this is one that this anonymous person or group called Metaprofit has sort of kick started. And it's attracted a lot of really interesting developers in the ecosystem to build out these markets where instead of voting on a particular proposal, you bet on it. You basically create these markets where there's basically an outcome. So the classic example is like, should a company fire a CEO? And then basically the stock gets split into two. One is fire CEO stock, people bet on that. And then there's like, keep CEO stock, people bet on that.
00:48:23.316 - 00:48:49.790, Speaker A: And whichever has the higher price over a predetermined period of time is the direction that they go. And sort of, it's more of a skin in the game way of determining decisions for an organization. And so they're implementing this first for Dao governance, and they're basically creating this product called Futarchy as a service where you basically offer any Dao, like, hey, instead of voting one token, one vote, use this market based solution. So, pretty excited about that.
00:48:50.170 - 00:49:16.114, Speaker B: I really like metaprofit. He's good on Twitter. Anybody should. If you're listening, follow him. But it's a very interesting idea. I think these like, to your point, these zero to ones, whether it's dpen or order books on chain, it's kind of opens up this new avenue of interesting applications. I mean, just like smart contracts where people just experiment with different things.
00:49:16.114 - 00:49:35.032, Speaker B: And I'm curious to see where it all goes. And if the future today looks anything remotely like what it will look in ten years, or just the applications that ultimately get forged through the fires and through iterations, they just look completely different than they are today.
00:49:35.216 - 00:49:55.596, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so this is another interesting thing. I'm sure you have it with your partner, but I have certain things that I believe about crypto. I mean, no one really knows what's going to happen with crypto. We don't know what the killer use cases are going to be long term. I have my views on it. My other two partners have their views on it. A lot of other people do.
00:49:55.596 - 00:50:31.230, Speaker A: But I personally think what crypto is really good for is creating new novel markets that couldn't have existed before. And so the first one was bitcoin. How do you create non sovereign store value markets? That's bitcoin. That's pretty much all it does. And I think that's proved out to be a particularly good use case. But what are all the other market based solutions that can create? When we look for things like Deepin, I think that's, like, a great example of, like, new novel markets for creating, you know, better allocating resources to solve a particular problem. So that's.
00:50:31.230 - 00:50:38.206, Speaker A: That's what we just. If there's any people building in our hackathons, that's what you should be thinking about is, like, how to create a new novel market.
00:50:38.358 - 00:50:46.426, Speaker B: Yeah. When is. So there's currently a hackathon going on now. Is that still open to new participants?
00:50:46.558 - 00:51:30.800, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, obviously these things are very competitive, and so a lot of the teams who win build throughout the whole period of five to six weeks. But there have been winners who have just, like, come in with, like, a week left and just, like, literally slept on the ground and, like, just, you know, build something very quickly. A good example of this was Zeta. There's, like, a pretty famous picture that Tristan, the founder of Zeta, posted after the hackathon that they won in 2021, where it was just literally, just like a blanket on a floor, and it was like him and his co founder literally just slept on the floor and coded for, like, seven weeks, seven days straight. So it's possible to join the hackathon. I don't know when this episode is going to come out, but April 8 is the due date.
00:51:31.220 - 00:51:40.554, Speaker B: Amazing. And then after that process, I mean, can you just walk us through, like, the judging? And then how often do you host these events?
00:51:40.652 - 00:52:22.974, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So, in practice, we run these hackathons. They're five weeks long. Then once we receive all the product submissions. So, in hyperdrive, which was the last hackathon we received about 1000. Our team coliseum, as well as members of Solana foundation, as well as some external developers who volunteered, will take basically a first pass and try to filter out maybe some spam or people who just didn't get to a salon integration or something like that, where we can basically get it down to a short list of the top 200 ish projects. Then that's where we sort of send that shortlist to this stable of judges.
00:52:22.974 - 00:52:50.924, Speaker A: I think you've been actually a judge in the past. I know your partner has as well. We basically send the shortlist to them and just say, hey, send us back your scores on these teams. And some people look at all of them, some people look at all 1000. Beyond just the short list, some people look at specific verticals. So a Defi founder maybe would be interested in just the Defi track. Anyway, we have that going on in parallel.
00:52:50.924 - 00:53:40.150, Speaker A: We have a group of developers who basically are just looking at the GitHub repos of that shortlist and making sure that demos are working functionally. And then after a couple of weeks, we get that feedback. The coliseum team basically aggregates all of that, and then we sort of stack rank the winners from, based on that feedback in our own evaluation of projects. So that leaves roughly, that goes from 200 to basically 40 winners. From those 40 winners, we basically, that's your only way to get into coliseum, the accelerator, and get investment. So of those 40 winners, we will basically consider each one of them. We will interview each one of them and then choose roughly, I think, for this first hackathon, about ten teams to actually end up accepting the accelerator and making an investment.
00:53:40.150 - 00:54:35.316, Speaker A: So that's generally the flow. I think one obvious thing people always ask is, how do we get on the short list? How do you make that first cut? That really comes down to the presentation and the idea that you decided to build. I think one difference between our hackathon and traditional ones is that it's not about how much work you've done, how much code you've written. Obviously, you need to do some amount, you need to have some sort of working demo, you need to have a Solana integration. But it's really about the quality of the idea that you've pursued. Can this become long term, a viable project that you work on full time? If it doesn't make that cut, it's going to be very difficult to make the cut to win an award, which is very different than a traditional hackathon, I would say. And so, yeah, hopefully that kind of gives you an end to end perspective on what happens after the hackathon ends.
00:54:35.428 - 00:54:40.644, Speaker B: Yeah. Amazing how. And you're doing this two, three times a year?
00:54:40.772 - 00:54:47.616, Speaker A: Two to three times a year. We'll do another hackathon probably sometime September, October, the later this year as well.
00:54:47.688 - 00:54:54.460, Speaker B: Awesome. And do you think this is just a start version one of indefinitely? What's the end goal?
00:54:55.040 - 00:55:41.688, Speaker A: The end goal with the hackathons or with Coliseum? Oh, I think there's tremendous upside in the Solana ecosystem. That's where we're going to focus all of our time. This is what our fund is dedicated to, and we're building the product, and we're even going to probably implement some on chain features on Solana long term. And so I think we're excited to back quality founders in the Solana ecosystem long term. Who knows what happens with crypto? Like, Solana didn't even really exist, like six, seven years ago. Who knows what's going to come out six to seven years from now? And so we're excited about this model. Wherever I.
00:55:41.688 - 00:56:02.476, Speaker A: You run this hackathon for a particular open source ecosystem, you help the quality builders who are actually in earnest trying to build, like, a breakout startup, invest in them and help them on board, and ultimately try to just grow the top of the funnel, as you said, for any particular technology. But the most exciting technology in the world right now, as far as we're concerned, is Solana.
00:56:02.628 - 00:56:10.532, Speaker B: I love it. Anything that you feel like we miss or we should make sure that we go a little bit more in depth.
00:56:10.556 - 00:56:44.320, Speaker A: In, um, I'd be curious to know, like, just get your opinion on, like, you know, we. We follow other ecosystems pretty closely. Um, when we started coliseum, we, you know, we're thinking, like, should we do this? Like, massive cross chain competition? We ended up deciding that wasn't the right choice. But I'm curious, from your perspective, you talk to many technical founders from a lot of these different ecosystems, some more nascent than others, to put you on the spot. Who are you excited about besides, obviously, Solana?
00:56:46.220 - 00:57:45.848, Speaker B: To me, the properties that I think enable Solana to be unique are the parallel processing and the high throughput. So having bigger blocks and being able to really, I would say one of the unique benefits was integrating them all together. There's all this talk about the modularity versus the integrated approach. I think, to me, the magic of blockchain was always, like, that shared state. The more information or data that can live in one giant ecosystem, to me, the more interesting things that happen in a real world. Example, Ethereum was similar at that point in one point in time with defi summer, like you had the yield farming, there was a lot of interesting things going there, kicked off by compound. You had the food tokens, but then as Ethereum became a little bit more expensive to use, and then you had l two s that really fragmented and broke that user experience.
00:57:45.848 - 00:58:24.200, Speaker B: And then it wasn't just ethereum, it was arbitrum optimism based and everybody kind of voting for their own flavor because it's not really unified. And so I very much appreciate those unified ecosystems. And so I do think Solana, especially with fire dancer, is going to accelerate their lead. Super excited for what jump and firedancer is doing. I think the Sui team out of mists and labs is very technical, very strong. I like talking with Sam Blackshear. I'm actually going to be speaking at their upcoming first breakpoint event here in Paris soon, which I'm excited about.
00:58:24.200 - 00:58:43.264, Speaker B: Monad is doing some interesting things around paralyzing the EVM. So as say, I think if the ethereum ecosystem, in my opinion long term, they're going to have to have to remain viable and competitive, are going to have to have similar properties to these high throughput blockchains.
00:58:43.392 - 00:58:52.240, Speaker A: Do you think people, I think the big question for me around like say, and specifically Monad is are people etH aligned or are they evm aligned?
00:58:52.320 - 00:58:53.300, Speaker B: They're evm.
00:58:53.680 - 00:59:04.220, Speaker A: They're EvM aligned. Do you feel that people who have been using L2s or Ethereum to date are less tied to the money aspect and like the.
00:59:04.300 - 00:59:06.164, Speaker B: I believe so, and are willing to.
00:59:06.212 - 00:59:10.772, Speaker A: Experiment and feel that Monad is like aligned with the vision of Ethereum?
00:59:10.916 - 01:00:37.962, Speaker B: I don't even like, I would just say like if the infrastructure doesn't work or it has a harder time scaling past 100 transactions per second, or these new L2s do not have the cracked virtual machine to be able to do that, and they want to continue all the progress that they made with the Ethereum virtual machine? You would want to most likely port that application to somewhere that would allow you to keep all the progress that you made. The hard part today is, I mean in Solana, and you experienced this directly when trying to court Ethereum developers. It's a different programming language, it's a different virtual machine, and it's not like you can plug and play your application with modad and say each both allow you to keep the Ethereum virtual machine, but add the properties of high throughput and parallelization. And so to me, I used to be a giant EtH Maxy, probably similar to you, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. And the more that I've learned, I've come to appreciate the product side more, that the technology is serving the users. It's not the user serving the technology. And I think, in my opinion, Ethereum kind of got a little bit lost in the sauce, and now the users are really serving the technology instead of vice versa.
01:00:37.962 - 01:00:47.674, Speaker B: And I appreciate these new high throughput blockchains, Solana included, that it's really trying to make products that actually make our lives better instead of the other way around.
01:00:47.762 - 01:01:47.690, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I've been a bitcoin maxi, I've been an Ethereum maxi, and I think maybe some people, based on what I tweet about, consider me a Solana Maxi. I don't think I am. One thing I think you mentioned this is that both at the technology level, I'm so glad that all of these different approaches exist. The competition, the different approaches are going to result in crypto ultimately going mainstream because there's going to be so much demand for getting users on your particular block space. I'm really happy that all of these particular approaches exist. I want to see more approaches also at the marketing growth acquisition layer, too. Obviously, we're really interested in hackathons as that mechanism, but I would love to see more experimentation, these other ecosystems around, other ways that I could learn from or others could learn from as well.
01:01:47.690 - 01:02:24.650, Speaker A: And then this also goes at the venture capital layer, too. I'm glad that you guys have a different strategy compared to us versus other funds versus these multistage mega funds. I think that's also very healthy. And so this is why I'm so bullish on crypto generally. At the end of the day, when people ask me, is like the amount of human capital and experimentation in all of those layers focused on this one particular industry is unlike anything I've ever seen. I would even throw AI into that. Like it is a completely multidimensionally more interesting and.
01:02:24.650 - 01:02:34.734, Speaker A: Yeah, more, yeah, just a more interesting multidimensional industry.
01:02:34.862 - 01:03:32.516, Speaker B: I think to work in iron, sharpens iron. And I think now we're getting to the point where there's new people coming in. I think we had kind of the bitcoin maxis that gave birth to Ethereum and Ethereum's experimentation, and now we have the high throughput blockchains. And I think you have to keep crossing that chasm. And what I've seen, at least in the industry, anytime you're a maxi, you tend to get slaughtered long term and so I, I think you and I are very open minded in the sense that the industry is still young. But directionally, I'm excited that we're less focused on infrastructure today and now more focused on the application stack, because I think it's really what's needed for us to grow the industry. And as you said, as more people come in and it gets more competitive, both on vc side, application side, infrastructure side, it just makes everybody better.
01:03:32.668 - 01:03:36.108, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Cool, man.
01:03:36.204 - 01:03:49.348, Speaker B: Well, Maddie, thank you so much for inviting me to your home. Thank you for beautiful conversation and wish you in Coliseum all the success and excited just for the growth of Solana ecosystem. It's an exciting time.
01:03:49.444 - 01:03:51.340, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, man. Thanks. Thanks for having me.
