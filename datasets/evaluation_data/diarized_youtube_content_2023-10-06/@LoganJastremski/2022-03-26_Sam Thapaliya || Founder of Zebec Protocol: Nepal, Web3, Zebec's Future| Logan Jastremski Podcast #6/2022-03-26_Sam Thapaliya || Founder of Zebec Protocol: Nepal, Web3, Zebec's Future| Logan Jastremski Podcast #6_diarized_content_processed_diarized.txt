00:00:00.440 - 00:00:02.286, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Sam.
00:00:02.438 - 00:00:03.342, Speaker B: Thank you, Logan.
00:00:03.446 - 00:00:15.022, Speaker A: I appreciate you coming on the podcast and helping me on this journey. It's been really fun so far, learning the podcast and talking with people like you.
00:00:15.126 - 00:00:33.976, Speaker B: Oh, amazing. You're doing great work, at least on the front that we need more content where people are actually having two way dialogue around various different persons. You brought in your podcast, right, Sid? I was the one with Sid, one with Laura. So, you know, super excited to be here.
00:00:34.048 - 00:01:01.932, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, no, it's. There's some good conversations, but it's more, I would say, like, around on the outside and people that don't necessarily have all the information on the insider kind of know from the building perspective. So, yeah, once again, thank you. Maybe we could just start off the conversation on a little bit of your background, how you got into tech and how you got into crypto.
00:01:02.036 - 00:01:07.300, Speaker B: Yeah. Awesome. So Sam came from Nepal four and a half years ago.
00:01:07.380 - 00:01:07.780, Speaker A: Wow.
00:01:07.860 - 00:01:21.572, Speaker B: Right? So a pretty interesting story about Nepal was, like, when I was born, there was the second civil war going on. Okay. So, like, up until I was like, 1213 years old, like, I have no idea, like, like, how computers look, like.
00:01:21.676 - 00:01:22.228, Speaker A: Right.
00:01:22.364 - 00:01:36.874, Speaker B: But I somehow saw them and, like, I got lucky because I got. I went to this school where they had, like, it was, it was english school and they had computers. And surprisingly, they taught, like, anyone above 6th graders how to write code in basic.
00:01:36.962 - 00:01:37.378, Speaker A: Really?
00:01:37.474 - 00:02:11.922, Speaker B: Yeah. That was very interesting because, like, and I was writing code in windows 95, 1120 kb ram, right, on basic. And, you know, like, at some point, like, by the end of the year, I was, like, writing like, gui based code in basic. You know, it's easy to write GUI base code in like, j's or HTML five, right. But to be able to write in basic was definitely an achievement. But I realized I was really good at it because I like instruction sets and I can, like, pretty much, like, follow easily once I like, you know, understand the end to end of it. And, yeah, I was like, I was writing software.
00:02:11.922 - 00:02:45.762, Speaker B: So I figured out, like, you know, that you actually can make money and things like that. And right around that time, you know, like, you have a group of friends who are also into computers. And there was a time like, you know, like, when like, 2013, 2014 was the anonymous was pretty big and, like, going down, like, down that rabbit hole somehow. I got introduced to, like, bitcoin white paper. And I read it once and, like, as one of my friends showed it, like, you know, he was talking about, like, bitcoin and like, you know, money in your money being in your wallet. And I'm like, what do you mean by, like, digital money in your wallet? Like, right. And read the whole thing.
00:02:45.762 - 00:03:05.170, Speaker B: And I was like, wow, it makes no sense, right? I was like, okay. Like, this is, like, so I have this bunch of numbers, and you have a bunch of numbers, and there's value because both of us believe that there's a value that made no sense because I'm from Nepal. Right? Like, there was not even digital banks back then. This was in 20 13, 20 13, 20 14.
00:03:05.250 - 00:03:05.682, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:03:05.746 - 00:03:34.566, Speaker B: Right. And right after that, like, you know, there was a big earthquake in Nepal, and, like, my whole trajectory of life changed because I took two years off trying to start company and things like that. And that was a time, like, when, you know, someone actually introduced me to bitcoin and, like. And received first, like, you know, first few satoshis of my life, and. And that just, like, kind of changed. Because in Nepal, you don't have banks for anyone younger than 18 years old. Right.
00:03:34.566 - 00:03:38.838, Speaker B: You have to have your bank account through your parents, and there's no digital bank.
00:03:38.894 - 00:03:39.222, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:39.286 - 00:04:20.324, Speaker B: Right? And so. And not, like, unlike America, you don't have cars because you, like, you pay 200% taxes, so not many people can afford it. So, hypothetically, you can have banks, but practically you are not, because no one's going to walk 7 miles to go to a bank. And lack of access around financial services opened up the world of bitcoin. And right around that time, Ethereum came out and read the whole white paper and realized that, wow, it actually makes sense. Two years ago, it was not making sense because I was a teenager, and for me, the whole life was just, I don't know, just, like, reading. Reading whatever the stuff that my school teaches and, like, you know, get a job or something like that.
00:04:20.324 - 00:04:29.772, Speaker B: Right? That was, like, my life. And when I was 15, when I actually wanted to be an entrepreneur and, like, that, by that time, the world was like, you know, the world that I saw was much bigger than just, like, in a small village in Nepal.
00:04:29.836 - 00:04:30.268, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:30.364 - 00:04:40.444, Speaker B: And that was a time when I was like, oh, shit, this is. This is. This is more than just, like, you and I giving each other a bunch of digit and saying, both of us building this hypothetical, like, numbers.
00:04:40.492 - 00:04:40.748, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:40.804 - 00:04:44.806, Speaker B: Having a value. Right. So, so, yeah, that was, like, my entry into crypto.
00:04:44.958 - 00:05:15.960, Speaker A: That's insane. That's super insane. That's inspiring, that. I mean, that. I mean, I think. I mean, there's a lot of hardship in there, but you're able to identify these potential technology solutions from some of the technology background that you had and see how you could marry those two together. That's very impressive.
00:05:15.960 - 00:05:17.256, Speaker A: Very impressive.
00:05:17.448 - 00:05:47.818, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the most interesting part was when you're reading bitcoin white paper, if you're a teenager, it makes no sense to you. You have things like distributed computer, the hash browse, and all these different things. Every single word has different 80 pages of definitions and explanation. And, and like, I had a friend of mine who was really like really into the same stuff that I was into as well. And we used to like just like throw ideas back, back to each other.
00:05:47.874 - 00:05:48.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:48.458 - 00:06:10.356, Speaker B: And, yeah, and the funny thing is, both of us are in doing crypto right now, and he actually went to the more like, you know, centralized route. He works for like a couple of tech companies as like consultant, like, you know, helping them strategize on their like decentralized, you know, data, like database solutions and things like that. And I went to the starting my own protocol route.
00:06:10.468 - 00:06:15.556, Speaker A: That's insane. So you got into Ethereum at like one time point?
00:06:15.668 - 00:06:18.572, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like 2015, 2016.
00:06:18.716 - 00:06:22.520, Speaker A: That's super early again. Or did you start building on Ethereum initially?
00:06:22.820 - 00:06:58.952, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think when smart contract first came out, right. And right after the whole like the makers hack and things like that, right around that time, because I knew j's like from a pretty, like, you know, young age. So, like, when it came out, like, building Ethereum is really easy. Yeah, right. So just like figured out that it's actually a lot easier. And at first, like, you know, there was not many like, solution that you can imagine because I don't have a finance background myself. And if you don't have a finance background and if you think money, it's just like I put it in my pocket and then I deposit in bank and I get the money back whenever I need it.
00:06:58.952 - 00:07:34.498, Speaker B: If you have that, if that is the only understanding of you, of your money, then there's little luck to nothing you can do. So for me, I had some basic economics understanding because I used to read a lot of stuff in my high school and things like that. So try to build things. And right around the makers hack, I was like, oh, what do I think about it? The security and all that kind of stuff. There was a lot of things, but yeah, like, that's like when smart contracts started coming out, that was the time when I was like, you know, started dabbling around the world of building.
00:07:34.554 - 00:07:47.110, Speaker A: Dapps, that's, that's nuts. And so were you building during that like 2017 bull market or did you start going, like, more hardcore after, like, 2018? 2019.
00:07:47.450 - 00:07:57.196, Speaker B: So 2017, like, second half when I first came here. Right? Like, that was the, like, the height of crypto euphoria, right? I don't think it's a crypto euphoria. It's actually. I call the crypto enlightenment.
00:07:57.268 - 00:07:57.628, Speaker A: Yes.
00:07:57.684 - 00:08:08.804, Speaker B: Right. It's like when some, like, you know, the. I don't know. Like, I think it was like Francis Bacon who said, like, the power of knowledge is not to be whether it's right or wrong. It's rather like, how much it empowers you. Right.
00:08:08.852 - 00:08:09.268, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:09.364 - 00:08:23.100, Speaker B: And in 2017, second half, like, you know, you go to. You go to a dinner and, like, one of the first thing you will, like, somehow talk is, was around. Around crypto, especially in San Francisco. I don't know. Like, I'm pretty sure you were around there at that time.
00:08:23.180 - 00:08:48.320, Speaker A: I was. So in the 2017, I was still at university, and my brother was like, hey, look at this crypto stuff. I was like, dude, I'm busy setting cs. Get away. I can't look at this. And then it just kept going up. And I finally started reading enough and just went 48 hours down the white papers and YouTube and on the other side, I was just like, holy shit, it was a crazy moment.
00:08:48.320 - 00:08:50.944, Speaker A: But, no, I wasn't in San Francisco at that time.
00:08:51.112 - 00:09:45.680, Speaker B: And so the interesting thing about San Francisco, almost all the ICO booms was happening there, right? So they were like, draper, like, team Draper was, like, the first big vc that was adopting crypto. He had this whole setting where they invested in quite a lot of crypto deals. And a lot of these famous crypto VC's right now, they were just getting started, right? And ICO was happening everywhere. So they. And I think the first crypto, like, in a 2017 euphoria, or what I call crypto enlightenment, was actually really good because the world wants an economic incentives, right? And if you make $100 after investing, like, $10 on some digital something, you don't even need to know. But now that you made dollar 90, you were like, I want to know why I made $90, so that I want to make more of it.
00:09:45.720 - 00:09:46.088, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:46.184 - 00:09:59.724, Speaker B: So it was actually a good thing because, like, a lot of people didn't know how Ethereum and how smart contract work and how, like, you know, consensus was achieved in, you know, Ethereum, like, in ethereum, like, you know, distributed computing. But people knew that they could make money.
00:09:59.812 - 00:10:00.172, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:00.236 - 00:10:03.868, Speaker B: Hence people, like, went down the rabbit hole and actually was a good thing for sure.
00:10:03.964 - 00:10:31.772, Speaker A: No, no, I totally agree. The 2017, there was a lot of lessons, brought a lot of people in this space. And the people that I'd say kept with it through that bear market and kept building and kept learning are now kind of at the forefront of this bull market. But more so, just having that couple of years of experience now is definitely showing its fruits of the labor.
00:10:31.916 - 00:11:00.296, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Not just the fruit of labor. Right. Because crypto is, like, a global, I think, not just thing that happens in a small, like, in San Francisco. Right. So now what is happening is, like, you have gone through, like, a lot of these ups and down, like, you know, price sometimes going 40% down in a week and a half or two weeks. Right? And the thing that happens in 80 to 20, like, 80 to 90 years in smart contract, the stocks world.
00:11:00.296 - 00:11:04.112, Speaker B: Right? So, like, stock market world, that probably happened in three years time.
00:11:04.216 - 00:11:04.980, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:11:05.400 - 00:11:31.430, Speaker B: And if you were, like, looking at the price every, like, you know, looking at the price and, like, you know, the ecosystem for three years, it's like, you know, you have the experience and the. What is it? Like, it's basically like, conviction as, like, even, like, Warren Buffett. Whatever Warren Buffett saw in the. In the market in night, like, in 80, 90 years, you probably saw in three years. That was of the swings. And now it's like, I haven't, like, I haven't even checked, like, the price of, like, Solana in a while.
00:11:32.210 - 00:12:04.272, Speaker A: No, I mean, I think once you actually start focusing on, like, building the products and what benefits the products provide, then, like, price becomes a little bit more secondary. I mean, I think obviously, like, price brings people into the space as in 2017. But I'm just more impressed by all the builders and the products. And that's, to me, the biggest differentiation from 2017 with, like, all the icos, like, today is much different. Like, there's actually working products.
00:12:04.426 - 00:12:43.150, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, exactly. And even the more interesting thing about this now is even, like, look at nfts, right? Like, yes, there was, like, the 2007 cryptokitties, right? Like, which, like, blow up the gas prices, right? But what it did, like, that time, people were like, okay, you can make money from nfts. And in, like, the last year, like, you know what I said, the 2021 to 2020, end of 2022. Like, in end of 2021, that, like, 365 days period, people went on from, like, oh, you can make money from this, buying it to. You can make money from this by creating it. Hence, like, people. Like, you might be a coder.
00:12:43.150 - 00:13:03.746, Speaker B: You are creating, like, you know, you're actually coding it, and now you if you're a non coder, you're actually coming up with ideas for nfts as well. And it just like, adds more and more people to ecosystem, right. And if there's like, you know, large enough population into any economic system, all of a sudden it starts to create its own value and its own sets of rules. That's the most exciting part about it.
00:13:03.778 - 00:13:31.764, Speaker A: It's so exciting. Yeah, I mean, I call it like the black hole. Like, people approach it from many different angles, either the NFT or DeFi or now gaming, but it all kind of converges on crypto, which is even more wild. But I appreciate that fact because it brings so many different minded individuals all into kind of a shared vision of what this is going to become. It's beautiful.
00:13:31.892 - 00:13:39.932, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just like, you know, I don't know who said it, but, like, the beast is big enough that everyone can touch it from different places and they will still be able to grab a piece of it, right.
00:13:39.996 - 00:13:40.620, Speaker A: 100%.
00:13:40.700 - 00:14:04.718, Speaker B: And you can have your own explanation. It's like the, like, the open ended part of, like, you know, the crypto and Defi and the web3 now, right. Is so interesting that everyone can have their own perspective and there's no one person to be able to say that this is wrong. Whatever your perspective is, is wrong. As long as you're building something here and people are using a product, then you can have your own vision on it 100%.
00:14:04.814 - 00:14:16.558, Speaker A: That's awesome. So maybe segue into how you started building your product and how that journey has been.
00:14:16.654 - 00:15:03.932, Speaker B: Yeah, I think my journey on this product has been like, I don't know, it's a very, like, confusing, almost like a, like, arc that is written, like, you know, j like a tokens book, right? What happened was, like, back in 2017, I was writing, like, because I came from Nepal, right? We didn't have banks, and all of a sudden I like, you know, there's like four banks in front of, like, my college. Like, and you can go with your atm, take out the money, and you don't even have to go inside the bank to deposit the money. And I'm like, whoa. Right? It was a pretty interesting. And then you have Internet banking and then you have Coinbase and you have all this different thing. And I was like, wow. So at some point in the future, like, you know, you will be able to, you know, have money that can go from your account to the outside world, automatically interact with the outside world.
00:15:03.932 - 00:15:13.660, Speaker B: Economic incentives have said, follow the set of rules and come back with its own yield. Like, it's almost like a self driving money. You know how self driving cars, I think at some point in the future you'll have self driving money.
00:15:13.700 - 00:15:14.068, Speaker A: Sure.
00:15:14.164 - 00:15:18.516, Speaker B: The problem of that was, like, I imagine in the world in which there's no transaction fees.
00:15:18.588 - 00:15:19.564, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:15:19.692 - 00:15:43.388, Speaker B: And then you imagine, like, this, like, the real world where you have 2.9% fees and you have ach and, like, you know, the no ach in the weekend and, like, all this different thing. And I was like, well, like, the only way of doing this is via smart contract. Right? Like, the world of self driving money will come in where, like, you know, you can. Money. You can basically assign your money to this one set of rules that will just, like, you know, are the vaults now, right?
00:15:43.444 - 00:15:43.700, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:43.740 - 00:15:57.994, Speaker B: And, like, you know, I wrote a bunch of these things and, like, in my school, and the professor was like, yeah, makes no sense. And actually, a couple of days ago, I reached out to him and he's like, yeah, great job. You know, now it makes a lot of sense.
00:15:58.042 - 00:15:59.178, Speaker A: You're ahead of the time.
00:15:59.354 - 00:16:14.434, Speaker B: I think it was not just ahead of the times, it was just like, the. It kind of didn't make sense on the perspective of his, like, you know, his education. Like, his education background. His background has been like, money can only be created by the centralized government.
00:16:14.522 - 00:16:16.308, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. That's. That's a great point.
00:16:16.394 - 00:16:38.296, Speaker B: And, yeah, and I wrote this, and then last year, like, you know, somehow we stumbled back. Some people, like, some of us, we stumbled back to the same paper, and we're talking on things that does not make sense. And one of the things we ended up talking about was payroll. Right? Because, like, you were. You worked at Tesla, and. And, you know, mister. Mister Musk is pretty nice, and he pays you, like, like, twenty k a month.
00:16:38.296 - 00:16:43.048, Speaker B: And instead of receiving, like, you work for, like, 15 days and someone pays you in day 17.
00:16:43.184 - 00:16:43.728, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:43.824 - 00:16:58.364, Speaker B: And it kind of does not make sense because Mister Musk is one of the richest guy in the world, and Tesla has one of them, like, the biggest money flow in the world, and somehow they're taking 15 days of line of credit from you at 0% interest rate. That's basically what it is. Right?
00:16:58.412 - 00:16:58.924, Speaker A: That's true.
00:16:59.012 - 00:17:24.964, Speaker B: And if you're paying, like, if you're working in a company, you should be able to have access of your earnings in real time. Right. Why that was not happening. And we started researching and realized that it's the systems of the money that is in the real world. It just does not allow you to do you cannot be aching in real time, right. And then the banks running, like, specific time frame, you have fees and all that kind of stuff. And we're like, hey, there should be a world in which you are paid in real time.
00:17:24.964 - 00:17:48.872, Speaker B: And we went, like, you know, you started researching and, you know, realized it's impossible to do this in traditional rails, and you can only do this with smart contract. As I said, like, the fun thing for me is, like, my background actually is in AI. I write machine learning models. And the other thing was, like, I used to audit, you know, I used to audit codes with, like, some of my friends. And since 2017, that was, like, my kind of my side gig. Or, like, that's how I survived my college years. Right.
00:17:48.872 - 00:18:10.104, Speaker B: That's awesome. And so it was like, I know, like, I had only two backgrounds really well, and it kind of made sense for me to start looking and realized that it's not just for the payroll, it's only work. It also works for token vesting. Right. It's the lifeblood of, like, you know, the digital world. And it also works for subscription. Right? Like, you can, like, let's say you can lease a Tesla, which is basically a subscription.
00:18:10.152 - 00:18:10.400, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:10.440 - 00:18:17.170, Speaker B: Right, yeah. And you're basically having to pay some, like, a lot of money upfront. Right. You know, like, 500, $600 a month.
00:18:17.210 - 00:18:17.474, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:17.522 - 00:18:21.202, Speaker B: Imagine that subscription can be real time so that there's, you know, your hands are not tied down.
00:18:21.266 - 00:18:21.802, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:21.946 - 00:18:50.518, Speaker B: So, like, every seconds of Tesla you're driving, you're only paying for that second. Or imagine, like, you know, you are in a world in which, like, netflix account, right, they charge, like, $15 a month, you know, 99% of the time. I don't even watch Netflix. Right. Like, with this how charge it. Imagine the only thing for the content that I'm watching. Like, per the seconds of the content that I'm watching, right? So the idea is to be able to build, like, a programmatic cash flow or continuous settlement, right? Continuous settlement protocol on top of Solana.
00:18:50.518 - 00:19:07.184, Speaker B: And the first app we're building ourselves is a payroll app, which is an onchain payroll app in which an employer can pay an employee in real time. And so that, you know, Tesla could pay you every single second. And you can take that money, put it in different yield vaults and things like that, and have the highest efficiency for the capital that you have earned. A.
00:19:07.222 - 00:19:43.458, Speaker A: That's awesome. No, that's pretty ingenious. And I haven't even thought too much about all the different use cases that you can do with instant settlement. But, yeah, there's a lot I was curious. One thing that I think about a lot outside of product is how do you choose? To me, picking product is probably one of the most important things as a founder or builder. But then outside of picking what product to build, how did you choose or come upon, like, Solana to build this protocol?
00:19:43.594 - 00:20:20.846, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Solana, you know, the earliest, like, you know, experience with Solana was like, you know, back in 2017, eos was like, eos was like, one of the biggest thing, you know, like, they raised a bunch of money, and I happened to lose some money myself. Right. And once you lose money, you want to know why you lost money? And you read the entire white paper and you're like, kind of makes sense, but, like, why didn't it work out? Yeah, right. And right around that same, same time, like, you know, Solantine was based out of San Francisco. And, like, some people, I was like, oh, yeah, there's another l one coming out from San Francisco. Actually, there was, like, two. Near was also around this, around the same place.
00:20:20.846 - 00:20:49.470, Speaker B: And so there was, like, two of them. But, like, I somehow, like, you know, found about, like, Solana from. From some of the, like, some of the VC's who knew, like, there was, like, the new l ones coming out, and. And it's gonna be like, you know, it's gonna completely transform how, like, you know, things that, like, ethereum was not able to solve. And I was like, well, what it is? And they're like, well, I have no idea. I'll send you the links of whatever the documents I can find in a week or two. And I read the whole thing, and I was like, makes sense.
00:20:49.470 - 00:21:25.236, Speaker B: I was just waiting for their token sale. And when 2018 flash sale happened on Coinbase, I just picked whatever the amount of token that I could get on Solana. Once you hold it for a while, you want to know more and more reasons on why it works and why it won't work. Yeah, like, you know, and last year, actually, like, so that was like, that's how I got into Solana. But last year, I was doing a lot of dapps, right? I built, like, February 2021. Like, NFT marketplace did some work there. And right around that time, it was like coin toss.
00:21:25.236 - 00:21:47.260, Speaker B: Like, you know, like, I built an ethereum. Not because. Not because, like, you know, that was the easiest one. It was just like a Solana ecosystem for NFTs was not ready then, right? Yeah, we experimented with a lot of things at that time. I experimented with a lot of things on nfts. And it's actually the easiest way of bringing people into crypto or, like, the proverbial web3. Right.
00:21:47.260 - 00:22:14.398, Speaker B: And, yeah. And then I went on to work on decentralized legal gym where a bunch of lawyers can come together because I had way too much legal fees from my previous company. And I was like, wouldn't be great if there's a bunch of lawyers coming in together, sending their contracts, uploading their contracts, and they could vote from each other, like, which one has the most, like, you know, unbiased, like, from the book, like, you know, from the signer and the signees point of view.
00:22:14.454 - 00:22:14.934, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:15.062 - 00:22:34.326, Speaker B: And you can come in and, like, buy that. Plus, like, you have the automated docusign and all that kind of stuff. And that time, you know, that was the time I like, you know, like, you know, research almost everything on how to build on Solana. And that time there was like, that was. That was a time when I actually was like, okay, perfect. This is the time to build on Solana.
00:22:34.398 - 00:22:34.718, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:34.774 - 00:23:00.576, Speaker B: And. And what happened was, like, the code was ready in Eth because it's easy to write there. Right? Like, almost going to deploy in Polygon. But by that time, like, in my, you know, my understanding of rust was like, okay, this is it. Like, I have built on Solana because, you know, the composability and there's a lot of, like, you know, things that at least on the. On the developer's point of view. Right.
00:23:00.576 - 00:23:12.116, Speaker B: Yes. It's hard to build on rust, but if c was the first language, like, you know, basic. If basic and c was the first language, you actually, like, you know, learn Python or J's, you will think that it's like, easy thing.
00:23:12.188 - 00:23:13.044, Speaker A: Yeah, true.
00:23:13.132 - 00:23:22.324, Speaker B: So I like, people are like, oh, building on Solana is hard. I'm like, it's actually not. Building on Solana is hard. It's just that people do have good coding skill on C is hard.
00:23:22.412 - 00:23:35.884, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. There's just so many levels of abstraction now, but, yeah, I don't know. People will learn rust. Like, you picked it up, and if you're a good engineer, I'm pretty confident that people will be able to learn it.
00:23:36.012 - 00:23:53.420, Speaker B: Yeah. And also, it's not actually the coding skill, it's actually the problem solving skill within coding, which is very, very transferable. It's like, oh, I'm not good at. If someone thinks that they cannot pick up a language in a month, it's just like, the problem solving skill is not out there.
00:23:53.500 - 00:24:09.024, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree. That's super interesting. So you're building on doing the NFT marketplaces in early 2021 and then at what time you start building what you're now working on.
00:24:09.112 - 00:25:11.500, Speaker B: So last year around, like, around September was like, you know, it was kind of easy because, like, you know, we already have extraction of all the things that we wanted to do. And like, a lot of VC's friends in my circle, right, they were like, great, like, you know, like, you know, give you money to be able to kick this off and. Yeah, like, you know, started with, with decent amount of cash flow in the cash in the hand to be able to build this. And we actually had, like, our product out pretty early on. The view wants us, for us to, like, you know, visualize on what are the things that are out there in the market, what are the things that are missing parts. Right. And how can we achieve the vision of, like, you know, be able imagine, like, you know, for us, the, like, the vision that we are imagining is like, one day everyone in the world will be paid in real time, right? And how can we make that happen in the next ten years instead of making it next 200 years? Because, like, at some point in the future, like, with the digital economy, right? Like, people will be able to be paid instantaneously.
00:25:11.500 - 00:25:21.100, Speaker B: That's the fact. Like, you know, it's like, you know, people imagine there will be computers, like, you know, how you will be able to do instant messaging, like, 200 years ago and they somehow we have it now.
00:25:21.180 - 00:25:21.868, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:22.044 - 00:25:38.590, Speaker B: And now, like, most of our Sci-Fi movies shows, like, instantaneous settlement, right? Yeah, a lot of movies where, like, yeah, I watched the movie, like, I don't know which one was it, but, like, where you were paid in like, the, the seconds and you can set, like, transforms, transfer seconds from one end to another.
00:25:38.630 - 00:25:40.590, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's a good movie.
00:25:40.750 - 00:25:58.334, Speaker B: Yeah, like, you know, and, and I think, like, you know, like, that's gonna happen. But our goal was like, how can we make that happen in the next ten to 20 years of our life? Yeah, like, in, and that's actually always the, like, interesting part is like, because as a builder, right, like, you wanna have as ambitious goal as possible, but how can you make it, like, a practical, ambitious goal, right?
00:25:58.382 - 00:25:58.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:58.630 - 00:26:24.350, Speaker B: So for us it was like, okay, what can we do to make this product interesting for actual web two users as well? And so, yeah, like, you know, around November, we had our first product out. We did a hackathon. We had a lot of builders building on top of it, raise another round of capital. We did a token sale. Now we just announced another hackathon. And so, yeah, like, the ecosystem is growing. People who care about this problem are like growing.
00:26:24.350 - 00:26:39.746, Speaker B: Right? And I think the first, the first important part about any crypto or defi project is like, education. How can you make, how can you convince people that this problem is real? Right? And the second is how can you align their incentives?
00:26:39.898 - 00:26:57.522, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean, and also with crypto kind of being unique from like the community aspect as well, like thinking about them. And you guys did something pretty novel with how you distributed your tokens. Crack. Could you like, go into that?
00:26:57.586 - 00:27:28.870, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So, like, for us, like with our token sale, a lot of, you know, a lot of project, what usually, you know, this is a, this is a pretty sad fact in crypto is like we talk about, you know, accessibility to the market, you know, providing power to the people. You know, all of those, you know, you know, the first line, like, you know, like in every, every month, every major crypto pitch, right? It's like giving power to them, to the, to the unbanked and all that kind of stuff is there. But they actually, the world of fundraising and investment in crypto doesn't work like that.
00:27:28.950 - 00:27:29.486, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:27:29.518 - 00:28:10.186, Speaker B: Like, you being an investor, you know that, like the seed round happens at x price, the private round happens at ten x that Price, or five, like four to four to ten x that Price, depending on who led the seed round. If you know the name, then you are going to pay ten x in the next round. If you don't know the name, you probably are going to pay four x in the next round. And usually those two round happens. And within two to three months of those two round, all the last one investor gets at least two to three x premium on the public sale. So most of the crypto investment have always been around, like the public sale has always been around giving the unrealized gains to the power of private investors. And for us, it kind of made sense because we're not here to do this for ten days.
00:28:10.186 - 00:28:15.578, Speaker B: We're not here to do this even for like, you know, two years. We're here, like, I'm saying that this is like ten to 20 year problem, right?
00:28:15.634 - 00:28:15.962, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:16.026 - 00:29:01.118, Speaker B: So if that is the case, then price makes no sense. How can we offer our token as cheap of the price as possible to the mass community? So for us, you know, we offered like, in terms of like, you know, if you wanted to come into our public sale, you could have actually bought token at the same price that last investor bought. Right? And for us, a lot of people try to do ideo like, you know, in one, in just one place. But we actually did ideo in multiple places. We did, we actually did like, you know, Google trends analysis on where these, where these people are searching these keywords and, you know, distributed like through solestar, solster, grappler finance and radium. Right? And we basically, and then we did with Republic as well. And so basically distributed token as many hands as possible.
00:29:01.118 - 00:29:39.384, Speaker B: And, and the idea for us was like, look, if, like, if there's like large enough population who actually hold this token, right? Once you are like, as I said, like, you know, once I bought Solana for three years, I was just like, how can this be big, right? What are the things that can happen in this, right? And same thing was going to happen with a lot of people who hold Zebex token now, because either they are the user of the product or someone who cares about the product, right? And aligning incentives with these mass people is always powerful. And also it actually gives you a sense of satisfaction that there are people who actually care about this vision like you as well.
00:29:39.472 - 00:30:09.760, Speaker A: Oh, 100%. I mean, I think that it's definitely unique how you approach it, but being able to allow public to come in at the same as the last round valuation and then also spreading it across as many token sale platforms or places to buy specifically where your users are, is not only unique, but I would say makes your protocol more powerful because you're putting it in the hands of more people.
00:30:10.220 - 00:30:58.748, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's like the idea is like you heard about Java. Sometime in future when you talk about payroll with any one of your friends, somehow you're going to mention about it, right? And for that to happen, like how many people talk about payroll? Not many, right? But how many people do talk about, hey, I just bought this coin that is, you know, that is doing something ABCD. I think another interesting thing that crypto and web3 has allowed you to do is like ten to 20 years ago, people never had like the dinner table talk was not about like money, not finance stuff. It was always about the movies that you watch or the politics, which is easiest thing to talk about. Now all of a sudden talking about money and like, you know, various different aspect of money is very interesting.
00:30:58.804 - 00:30:59.804, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:30:59.972 - 00:31:48.320, Speaker B: So that's why like the, our token sale is almost like a, like a marketing and a community building exercise for us, right? Like, you know, we had no, like no honest desire for us to make any money from this ideal platform because we already had private investors. Right? And the private, private market is big enough for us to be able to do this, like, do this like five or five to seven more rounds and still be okay. Right. But how can we have like, how can we have like, you know, 15 to 20,000 people that actually will care about this was public sale and now we have like in a few thousand holders of our token and the community has grown, grown like two x and so, yeah, this was a very, very interesting exercise experiment as well. Right. And I suggested, like I said, almost every single product project to actually follow. Like, you know, there was some stuff that like, you know, that could have done a little bit better on our end.
00:31:48.440 - 00:31:49.304, Speaker A: You always learn it.
00:31:49.352 - 00:32:06.160, Speaker B: Yeah, we always learn it. But I think anyone who's gonna like to do a token sale, I think I highly recommend them to, you know, just do it as a, same term as the private, like last round and, you know, do it in as like in a large part platform as possible and, and have as much a float right off the gate as possible?
00:32:06.280 - 00:32:44.016, Speaker A: No, I think that's amazing and definitely unique, but I hope it becomes more standard as the industry continues to mature and we kind of figure out as a collective the best way to build communities. But that's amazing that you've gone to a couple thousand holders supporting your project and now I'm sure will be much more interested in, I mean, one, the incentive aspect, but also just learning how they can help build and provide feedback for the product as well.
00:32:44.208 - 00:33:08.400, Speaker B: Exactly. And at some point they're going to come to our telegram or discord and be like, this button is not working, you know? Yeah, like, I think that, I think that's going to be the really interesting part because they're like, hey, I have a voice in this, you know, and that's the part that we want as well. It's like, you know, we want community to be able to like this. Like in last seven to ten days, we have like, like seven different countries. Like in your telegram chat we had to set up.
00:33:08.520 - 00:33:09.152, Speaker A: Wow.
00:33:09.296 - 00:33:30.512, Speaker B: Like, and I go there and like, I, like, I know, I don't understand like Vietnamese, like, you know, or like, you know, like a lot of these different languages that has been there, but it's like, you just see that if there's like 45 person typing at the same time about your product and I'm just like, wow, people actually do care about what we're doing.
00:33:30.576 - 00:33:50.194, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's, that's awesome. Over the next couple of years or so, what are you looking forward to most with the product and some things that you're looking at from the community aspect going forward.
00:33:50.362 - 00:34:02.838, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for us, we want to have a million holders of our token and we want to have the million payroll, like, you know, users will fire product, like in a million individual lives that are like, you know, getting paid in real time.
00:34:02.894 - 00:34:03.318, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:03.414 - 00:34:33.845, Speaker B: And I think that's gonna be the big achievement for us. Like once we cross that, I think we'll achieve the million on the payroll users before we hold, before we're able to create a million token holders because it's gonna take a while because Solana adoption is still happening. Right. But I think, like in next two to two to three years, that that can, that can be done 100%. Exactly, you know, sold for life. So, so, yeah, I think, I think that's a big focus. And simultaneously we want to have around like 10,000 active, like, developers on our ecosystem, deploying interesting apps on top of it.
00:34:33.845 - 00:34:36.957, Speaker B: Yeah. So like, you know, like million, million and 10,000.
00:34:37.013 - 00:34:38.117, Speaker A: That's the goal.
00:34:38.293 - 00:35:17.500, Speaker B: That's, and I think those, those three things is going to be like, in the most important thing. And, and a lot of people think that as a founder, you'll care about the plugin, how the price, how the token are launched and like, all that kind of stuff. You know, for me, it's just like, we will just keep on building, we'll keep on doing good things, and at some point you will start reflecting on the price and the community again. People who bought the token at $0.21 will start caring about when it's turning eight or ten x and when they join the platform. When they heard about the platform, it was a few thousand users, and now all of a sudden there's half a million users. I think it's just going to get more and more powerful.
00:35:17.580 - 00:35:55.248, Speaker A: Very true. That's awesome. It's a very wild story that you have from, I mean, the inception of getting the basics of computers, being able to be in Silicon Valley and kind of be at the forefront of Ethereum and also these new layer ones to identifying kind of from your childhoods, a use case that will actually have meaningful adoption to many people around the world building that and now continuing to iterate and bring people on board, that's, that's pretty wild.
00:35:55.384 - 00:36:37.902, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the most interesting story about like, the whole thing is like when I was, when I was born, like the, there was, there was no electricity in my village, right. And it was like a couple of months later it came out. It came. Right, and we didn't have tv, right. And at some point that we had, like, the black and white tv, and at some point, like, it started becoming color tv, and then at some point, we had a, like, dvd's where we can walk. VCds was the right thing that time. We started watching movies, and then, like, you know, and then all of a sudden, like, you know, at some point, we, you know, we had telephones and, like, you know, and imagine, like, you know, electricity came in us, like, what, 1900? Like 19 hundreds.
00:36:37.902 - 00:36:45.852, Speaker B: And computer came in around 1970 to 1980. Right. And that all happened to in like, 80, 90 years.
00:36:45.876 - 00:36:46.300, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:46.420 - 00:36:47.812, Speaker B: For me, that happened in ten years.
00:36:47.876 - 00:36:48.476, Speaker A: Wow.
00:36:48.628 - 00:36:48.964, Speaker B: Right?
00:36:49.012 - 00:36:50.280, Speaker A: It's a big transformation.
00:36:50.580 - 00:37:01.524, Speaker B: And I always tell myself that I was born in the time of Edison, right? And I somehow survived to live through the time of Vitalik and Anatoly.
00:37:01.652 - 00:37:33.030, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's awesome. Wow. No, it's not only inspiring, I think it should. It's powerful, and I hope it. I'm inspired, so I hope it inspires others. I think one of the also challenging aspects of the crypto space is as a founder, like, just taking care of yourself, managing the team, but managing protocol, managing the communities, so many different stakeholders polling you in so many different directions.
00:37:33.030 - 00:37:45.396, Speaker A: How do you find kind of managing all those different stakeholders while also feeling good and just managing your day to day?
00:37:45.548 - 00:38:16.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the biggest thing about any founder is, or anyone in the world is how do you get. What is the locus of your identity or what gives you some form of power, identity or whatever that is. As a builder, you always want to surround it around, building it. Right. And once you do that, all of a sudden, you know, it doesn't matter what time of the day is. It doesn't matter, like, it is rainier, like sunny, or, like, well, as long as the Internet is good and, yeah, I have a good Internet. Right.
00:38:16.198 - 00:38:30.822, Speaker B: If you like, if you have that, like, you know, you are. You're okay with that, right. And second thing is like, yeah, you know, you got to take care of yourself. Right. At least as a builder. Right? Like, go on a run, go on a walk, you know, and. And those are, those are the basic things.
00:38:30.822 - 00:38:45.858, Speaker B: But I think the most important part is, like, when you have a team of people is, like, at the end of the day, even though you are coding to this machine, right, and there's a, like, you know, there's a distributed computing systems that understands nothing but code. At the end of the day, the ones who are using is people.
00:38:45.954 - 00:38:46.250, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:46.290 - 00:39:10.890, Speaker B: And the most important thing in the world is people. The one who understand people like, you know, are able to do it no matter what. And so that's why it's like, it's a people thing. You have people team, our people, your investors are people, your stakeholder. Every one of them is our people at the end of day. And if you know how to take a good care of them, yes, things are going to mess up every once in a while. There might be a problem with your token seller, there might be a problem with your product.
00:39:10.890 - 00:39:37.192, Speaker B: No matter what happens at the end of the day, if you know how to do, how to do it, how to take care of people and just come back and relax and be like, hey, things happen, but it was not my intention to do that and I'm able to make it right. And nothing is like too hard in the world to, like, you know, to be not solved. Right? Like, look at makers hack, right? Like, and now makers one of the biggest product in the world.
00:39:37.256 - 00:39:37.664, Speaker A: True.
00:39:37.752 - 00:40:21.412, Speaker B: Right. As long as you keep on doing what you were doing and the community is going to come back. Because if you are not one of those projects that, you know, rucks people and, you know, as long as the funds are safer, right. So, like, if you, if you're not doing any of that stuff, you know, like, people are going to come back because people understand builders, right. And the people who, if you are working hard and if you're in your discord chats like, you know, like 18 hours a day and on all things that you care about is like, you know, building it, people using it and just like going back into the drawing board again and just like, you know, making it better and better. Right. At some point, you know, like the shift is going to happen and it's just like, and the best part about this is like asymmetric return.
00:40:21.412 - 00:40:26.952, Speaker B: You know, like it starts with one or two people and this is keeps on growing, you know, the community grows.
00:40:27.036 - 00:40:27.608, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:27.744 - 00:40:41.744, Speaker B: And that's the most important thing is like, nothing is too hard to, like, you know, like, no matter what happens, you will be able to make it as long as you are building it. Right. And just go back and just like, not, not be on panic mode.
00:40:41.792 - 00:41:26.748, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I love that. One of my, like, favorite things recently is just, I believe it's like the rocky coil. It's like, it's not how hard about how hard you can get hit. It's like how many times you can, like, actually like, get up and just like, keep going. And I, I like how, I mean, not only that, but because you overcome so many different obstacles as a founder but again, focusing on the people and the people that are using your products, the people on your team, the people in your communities, I very much admire that point of view in that aspect. So I think you count it.
00:41:26.924 - 00:41:38.228, Speaker B: Yeah. I said, like, you know, for us, it's the. How can we have a million people? Like, I want to imagine a world in which, like, I go back home in Nepal. Actually, the crazy thing, in Nepal, crypto is still illegal.
00:41:38.324 - 00:41:38.700, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:38.740 - 00:41:45.068, Speaker B: Right. So. But I want to imagine worldly news. I can go back and. And I can see someone being paid in real time there.
00:41:45.124 - 00:41:45.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:45.780 - 00:42:04.218, Speaker B: And. And that is not a problem. That, like, you know, no amount of l one l one s and no amount of fast transaction can make that happen is actually going to be on, like, the. It's actually going to be on the people that are using it. And at some point, people are going to push this to, like, more and more countries itself. Right. And that's, like, that's the.
00:42:04.218 - 00:42:30.436, Speaker B: One of the biggest goals is, like, how can I have everyone in the world care about this vision of, like, you know, being able to make money continuous? Because right now, it doesn't make sense. But once everyone in the world is paid continuous, there's no sense of credit. The whole. The world system of credit will completely change. Right. Because now you're not paid, like, once a month or once every 15 days. Your trade rating is, like, how many? Like, what? It's gonna be like, what is your.
00:42:30.436 - 00:42:36.252, Speaker B: What did you just say? Like, how much you make every. Every second? That's, like, based on that, you are actually given a, like, unique line of.
00:42:36.276 - 00:42:38.000, Speaker A: Credit that's super unique.
00:42:38.460 - 00:42:56.262, Speaker B: And that just, like, you know, starts, like, you know, like, you know, trickling down. Like, the bidding auction will start to change. It's not gonna be how much I can. Bit higher between two of us. This can be who has more money per second to go on longer. Right. Like, if we.
00:42:56.262 - 00:43:06.286, Speaker B: Both of us would start, like, $1 per second at one point. You know, you either your money is gonna dry up first before mine. Right. And I think there's gonna be new parameters of, like, options as well.
00:43:06.358 - 00:43:06.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:06.862 - 00:43:07.158, Speaker B: So.
00:43:07.214 - 00:43:28.178, Speaker A: Huh. That's. No, I'm looking forward to that world, and I'm glad you and your team are building it. Maybe just to wrap it up, we've been chatting for almost, like, 45 minutes. What is kind of, like, some words of wisdom or just some imparting words for everybody?
00:43:28.354 - 00:43:31.762, Speaker B: Wow. I'm like 22 year old soul.
00:43:31.906 - 00:43:33.430, Speaker A: You're fucking killing it, man.
00:43:34.370 - 00:43:51.082, Speaker B: I don't know if I'm in a position of my life to actually give any words of wisdom, but I think the one thing I have learned in my life is, like, just, like, you just have faith in yourself and keep on building people, like, they will. All it takes is, like, one person to believe in you.
00:43:51.186 - 00:43:51.914, Speaker A: I love that.
00:43:52.002 - 00:44:02.098, Speaker B: And it's just, like, you know, if at some point, it's gonna get better, like, look at me like, you know, I was born in, like, middle of nowhere in Nepal, and, you know, like, now I work at the same office with, like, anatoly.
00:44:02.154 - 00:44:02.434, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:02.482 - 00:44:14.026, Speaker B: Right. So it's just, like, things change, right? It's like, as I said, like, you know, just be true. Be true to yourself. Just keep on. Keep on working hard. All it takes is this one person, and your life will move to a completely different trajectory.
00:44:14.098 - 00:44:35.470, Speaker A: That's awesome. I think that's one of the things that I've been inspired most by. The founders that I've been chatting to. They all kind of come back to that one person, either investor or whether it's themselves or a family member or a certain person in the community that believed in them, and that belief helped them believe even stronger, and they just went for it.
00:44:35.570 - 00:44:45.630, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. It's just, like, you know, it's. It's very powerful thing for people to understand that, you know, that, you know, it's actually possible.
00:44:45.750 - 00:44:46.190, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:46.270 - 00:44:54.062, Speaker B: Right. And sometimes this takes some, like, you know, it's. The amount of time that is taken is gonna be different, but it's actually possible.
00:44:54.166 - 00:45:03.206, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Well, we'll end it on that. It's. It's possible and keep building. So thank you very much, Sam. It was a pleasure.
00:45:03.278 - 00:45:04.126, Speaker B: Thank you so much, Logan.
00:45:04.198 - 00:45:04.630, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
