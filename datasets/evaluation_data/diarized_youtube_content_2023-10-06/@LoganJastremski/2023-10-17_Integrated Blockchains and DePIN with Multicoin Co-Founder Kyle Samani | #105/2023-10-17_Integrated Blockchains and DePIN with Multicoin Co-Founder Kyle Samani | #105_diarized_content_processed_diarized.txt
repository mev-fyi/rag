00:00:01.120 - 00:00:53.802, Speaker A: This is a podcast with Kyle Simani, the co founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital. Kyle and I first sat down and had a conversation in Austin in 2022, where we touched upon Solana high throughput blockchains and what is now known as decentralized physical infrastructure networks, DPN. We double clicked on a lot of those topics today and expanded upon the active networks within deepen versus the more passive, such as digital commodities. What his point of view is on decentralized compute, and also touched upon his recent essay versus modular versus integrated blockchains. I think it was a wonderful conversation. Kyle's one of the few first principal thinkers that are in the crypto industry and a person that I admire as a manager myself. And last thing before diving into the episode.
00:00:53.802 - 00:01:33.620, Speaker A: Although our guests this week are managing partners of a registered investment advisory, nothing in this podcast should be considered an offer of multicoins investment advisory services or should otherwise be confused for investment tax, legal or other financial advice. Kyle, thank you for joining me on the podcast again. I was looking at our podcast that we record in Austin about a year and a half ago, and it was amazing to me just what has happened from then to now. And so a lot of interesting tidbits from there, but really looking forward to this conversation. I always feel like I learn quite a bit from you, so thank you for coming on.
00:01:34.120 - 00:01:37.424, Speaker B: Excited to be back on for round number two. Logan, let's jump into it.
00:01:37.552 - 00:02:02.350, Speaker A: Perfect. Well, I think ultimately you started multicoin in 2017, but fairly quickly, say six months, a year afterwards, we were in a pretty deep bear market. And that, I would say crypto is prone to these cycles. We're obviously about a year and a half, two years into the bear market now. Any kind of just general thoughts on the state of the market and where we are today?
00:02:04.890 - 00:02:35.150, Speaker B: Yeah, a few thoughts. One, I mean, look like this is pretty cliche, but stay positive, keep building. Things get better. The cyclicality in crypto is extra painful emotionally, so keep your head up. Two, touch some grass. That helps a little bit. Three, you know what? Ive been thinking about this market versus last cycle, and ill say this market cycle, to me, feels much worse than the last one.
00:02:35.150 - 00:03:09.574, Speaker B: Last cycle, there were no expectations. The 2017 ICO bubble happened and the outside world just laughed at. Crypto was like, yeah, whatever. And then Defi happened, and then nfts happened. And then obviously banks and stuff sort of do real things. And, I mean, Instagram was on the verge of rolling out nfts to a billion people, and obviously that got canned. And so to me, this market feels worse in that people started to pay attention and take it seriously.
00:03:09.574 - 00:03:39.180, Speaker B: And I think, largely speaking, expectations were not meth. Some were a function of product market fit not being there. Some were a function of being too early, some a function of trust being broken with all the CFI explosions in 2022. So different contributing factors there. But as a meaningful participant in the market today, I certainly feel the weight of that. But despite that, I try and make sure I touch grass and stay positive.
00:03:39.640 - 00:04:24.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that is important for how much we're actually online. It is remarkable how much getting some sunshine and going outside will actually do for your mental health. But kind of double clicking on your point on whether expectations were not met or the industry did not live up to its promises. Are there anything in particular there? Whether it was like the products didn't meet expectations, it was the underlying infrastructure of that was not able to kind of scale in a meaningful fashion. Was there anything in there particular that you feel like kind of caused outside of just number going down, a harder transition in this bear market than the past bear market?
00:04:26.210 - 00:05:13.832, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that nfts were a consumer phenomenon, and then, like, I can sit here and say, I believe that there will be digital artifacts on the Internet and people will collect them, but I think most people in the world don't believe that or don't even have enough requisite understanding to appreciate that. I think part of the challenge is it became a consumer phenomenon. A bunch of executives at a bunch of big companies were like, okay, let's figure this out. And then they kind of didn't. And so that's painful. And, like, watching all of these companies make the same mistake in terms of what they're doing and the experience running. So that's.
00:05:13.832 - 00:05:49.426, Speaker B: That's been a little bit disheartening to me. But on the flip side, like, there's a bunch of people iterating and innovating on nfts. There's teams like Tableland that are enabling dynamic nfts. There's new art focused exchanges like wild that are focusing on, I think they call them, what's it called? 3d space collection type things. So we're seeing people iterate on some of these ideas. Guys like drip and dialect are focused on these large scale drops, which hasn't really been done before. So the experimentation continues.
00:05:49.426 - 00:06:26.440, Speaker B: We don't obviously have the right shape yet, but I'm pretty optimistic that we'll get to the right shape. I think probably ten K PFP collections is probably nothing. Not the right shape, but yeah, we need to. I mean, look like if Ethereum in 2017, people were like, the killer app is icos and fundraising, and it turns out the killer app actually was fighting financial rails for Defi. And so we're kind of still at the 2017 ICO part of that analogy for nfts, and we're figuring out the defi part, so to speak. But I'm optimistic we'll get there. There's a lot of people trying to crack that nut.
00:06:26.820 - 00:07:33.430, Speaker A: Yeah, it was rather remarkable how many people actually came on chain or at least experimented with kind of the culture aspect of nfts. But I definitely agree the we'll see how the ten K PFP morphs over time, but maybe kind of double clicking on our past conversation in kind of the last like five minutes of our first podcast, you were really excited about this new capital formation that at that point in time, I think your first foray into that venture was with helium and then ultimately with hivemapper following. And since then it's really been kind of an explosion of these decentralized physical infrastructure networks that have really come about. And so I would love to kind of double click on them. I know you kind of segment them into gps dependent or of digital commodities. Can you touch upon how your thinking has really evolved over the last year and a half since you started investing in these decentralized physical infrastructure networks and where you think it will continue to go?
00:07:34.970 - 00:08:21.290, Speaker B: Yeah, so first I'll say we just published our content from the multicoin summit. One of the talks is from Shion on exploring some new frontiers in deepen. Encourage you to check out that talk. There's also a blog post that we published maybe a few weeks ago exploring some similar ideas. So I think a lot of our leading edge thinking is generally there. From my vantage point, I think my biggest learnings about deep in have been a focusing on things where it's passive. The more active engagement you require from the supply side of the network, the harder it is to make the deep in capital formation magic scale.
00:08:21.290 - 00:09:25.420, Speaker B: That's been a big learning lesson for us. Having observed a bunch of these networks, I think the other thing we've learned is don't overemphasize trying to solve the verification problem perfectly. In the early days, it's really easy to get caught up in all the crypto economic engineering around, like, hey, did this guy cheat and earn some inflation unnecessarily? Obviously you can't make it trivial to bypass, but I generally wouldn't focus on overengineering. I think most teams tend to over engineer on that. Filecoin is probably the biggest example of that, where the system is just very complex around the proofs and stuff. So generally be expedient, move quickly. And I'd say my last kind of major learning is you got to engage your community and you got to have a good voice for the community.
00:09:25.420 - 00:10:13.710, Speaker B: Deep in is very much like, wag me. And like, it's, I mean, literally, it's like, hey, we're all going to do this thing that independently. Any of us doing this thing is stupid, but all of us doing it together is legit and real. And so it's very much like we're all in the same boat rowing together and having someone who is kind of guiding the boat or whatever, right? Or like being the. What's the dude at an orchestra conductor? The conductor, you know, like, yeah, you need to kind of know how to lead your community. I think that's super important. I look at someone like Ariel, for example, at Hivemapper, and I actually do have followed the history of mapping for the last 15 years.
00:10:13.710 - 00:10:45.950, Speaker B: I follow the Google blogs and a bunch of people who have written various good stuff on Apple versus Google Maps and stuff. I can't say that I'm a mapping nerd. And quite frankly, being a mapping nerd is not a thing that ever occurred to me as a construct. But like, man, you go follow Ariel on Twitter. This dude is passionate about maps. And providing that kind of northern, that north north star for the community I think is really important.
00:10:46.490 - 00:11:30.700, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense in terms of the active versus passive and double clicking on that passive being example like Hivemapper, where you can just actively kind of put a dashcam in your car and you drive and do your day to day task. Or is, would active or passive also in your mind, be included into kind of like the more digital commodities with like, bandwidth, compute, and storage? It does totally have to be in a certain point, matters less whether it's in Miami versus New York or Texas, you can just add it to the network and over time it will hopefully contribute value.
00:11:31.800 - 00:11:59.360, Speaker B: Yeah, Hivemapper is a great example of being passive. You set up the dash cam and then kind of don't have to think about it anymore. Runs on autopilot. Most of the, you call it digital commodities. I think the term that's coming in vogue is by the Masari guys, is Devin or decentralized virtual infrastructure networks. I'll generally defer to the Masari terminology here, just to be consistent for the public. The Devin stuff is all, at least theoretically passive.
00:11:59.360 - 00:13:02.316, Speaker B: It should be set up computer, install software, turn on software, and stop thinking. Obviously, if it's not that, then you want to make sure you get towards that over time, because the only way you're going to scale the supply side of any devin network is if that is generally true. And then yeah, in terms of the GPS stuff, different use cases for DPIn or DvIn networks have different sensitivities to GPS. So, for example, if you consider something like render, probably the degree of gps specificity that matters is probably at the country level. Same with, yeah, that's probably the country level. Obviously, if you look at helium and hivemapper, that's pretty clearly at like the road level, or like the kilometer level, or maybe even less than kilometer level. If you look at filecoin, like for archival storage, all that really matters is the country for jurisdictional purposes.
00:13:02.316 - 00:13:59.180, Speaker B: But then if you start thinking about retrieval markets and cdns now, the degree of gps sensitivity that matters is probably measured on the order of hundreds of miles. Austin, Houston, Dallas, probably it's the same thing, but Austin versus Virginia is different. So there's a spectrum here of latency sensitivity. Interestingly, helium and hivemapper are at one extreme on GPS sensitivity. I would have thought that a lot of the leading DPIN networks would have would be less gps sensitive, just because the more gps sensitivity there is, the inherently harder it is. Of course, the flip side of that means the harder it is, it means the less that traditional capital formation techniques could solve the problem, and that opens up the opportunity for DPIN. So all kinds of ways you can slice and dice it and think about it, but gps sensitivity is definitely a big one.
00:13:59.600 - 00:14:29.450, Speaker A: Interesting, and maybe double clicking. I know you're very excited about render also kind of what's going on with their recent update to allow new clients. Can you kind of talk about a little bit how the progression of render network has gone since Multicoin's involvement with them and where you see that network going or evolving over time?
00:14:30.430 - 00:15:26.860, Speaker B: Yeah, so we had a chance to get involved with our network about two and a half years ago, met Jules and the team, and invested a pretty substantial amount back in, I believe, may of 2021. So working with them for a good while, the opportunity there is just awesome. I mean, their relationships in all of LA and Hollywood, for all the major creative studios from Otoy, are, bar none, like their best in class. And that demand for rendering workloads has been growing pretty nicely over that period. Obviously more recently the AI stuff started to happen and we kind of had. It's funny, actually, when we first started talking to the team in 21, they were like, oh yeah, we're focused on rendering, but one day we'll use this for machine learning. And we were like, yeah, sure, cool, whatever, we'll get to that.
00:15:26.860 - 00:16:11.890, Speaker B: And then obviously Jaji bt happened, and we were like, hey, I think. I think now's the time. And everyone was kind of in agreement, like, hey, now's the time. As we started to think about compute marketplaces more generally, beyond 3d rendering workloads, we came to realize a few things, probably the most important of which is that compute markets are heterogeneous on both the supply side and the demand side. The base unit of measurement for most compute workloads is flops or floating point operations per second. People talk about flops for a lot of compute workloads. In the case of render, they talk about, I think they're called octane hours or something.
00:16:11.890 - 00:17:01.970, Speaker B: But really, that's a derivative of flop. It's just a different scale of measurement of flops. When you look at the AI systems, a new major component comes into this, which is not just the sheer computational ability, but the latency of the memory to each compute unit. That's also not a homogeneous construct either, and the impacts of performance vary widely depending on the type of workload. What we realized was, hey, the types of workloads going to become more heterogeneous, there's going to be more rendering types, there's going to be diffusion models, there's going to be LLMs, there's going to be lots of different kinds of LLMs. At this point, with Lama being open source. I mean, there's dozens of these things being forked.
00:17:01.970 - 00:17:51.754, Speaker B: And we think that the amount of heterogeneity in base models is going to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. It may consolidate at some point, but at least for the next few years, it seems pretty clear that it's going to increase. And so the demand workloads are changing. The second thing we observed in our heterogeneous, the second thing we observed was, hey, there's a huge shortage of supply. Obviously, people like to talk about certain types of models can only run on certain pieces of hardware, which is obviously technically true, but I think is a static analysis as opposed to a dynamic one. The primary constraint in the entire technology market today is GPU hardware. Software is by definition, malleable.
00:17:51.754 - 00:18:46.730, Speaker B: Hardware by definition, is not. And so supply and demand economics suggests that the supply will conform to the available hardware. We've only just started to see this now in the last couple of months with llama two, but people are now saying, hey, can I tweak llama two? Maybe I lose five or 10% in whatever performance benchmark. But what if I reduce the compute requirement of the memory requirements by 90% and there's all kinds of these trade offs that you can make? Then a ton of people are exploring this efficient frontier. And so our insight number two, in this market was the software is going to conform to the hardware because the market is hardware constrained. Then observation number three was the hardware is obviously not homogeneous. A 100s are different than h 100s, which are different than 40 eighties and such.
00:18:46.730 - 00:19:42.740, Speaker B: If you think the total computational demand is just going to continue to grow at a pace faster than TSMC can build fabs, which in the near term, by definition is true, because the turnaround time for new fabs is measured in five plus year increments, then we need to figure out how to conform the software to the different hardware. And that means that this market as a whole is not going to be homogenous. We came up with, I'd say most of those assessments, call it six to nine months ago. I think all of those have more or less borne out correctly. It's still unclear what that will mean, if there will be one long term winner or not. But obviously in the near term, that means that there's a lot of this market will not be homogenous, it will be heterogeneous, and there will be a lot of opportunities out there. We're fortunate to invest in, I think three, maybe four teams that are focused on compute marketplaces.
00:19:42.740 - 00:19:48.540, Speaker B: And I expect we will do more because of the inherent heterogeneity of this market.
00:19:49.920 - 00:20:15.460, Speaker A: In the heterogeneous market for decentralized compute, similar to blockchains, bandwidth becomes a large factor of moving bits around. How does these bandwidth not limitations, how does bandwidth factor into these decentralized compute versus a traditional server cluster?
00:20:18.560 - 00:21:08.590, Speaker B: Everything is workload dependent in the context of, of LLMs, or I should say AI models. I mean, I think the public Internet is generally not a viable interconnect. Nvidia bought Mellanox in 2020 for 7 billion for their kind of custom card connection technology or whatever. They rebranded that technology to be nvlink, which is today. If you buy a cluster of a 100s or H 100 SDE, Nvlink is the thing that connects all those things together, is obviously a very customized networking tool. The latency of NVlink to connect those cards together, I'm guessing, is measured in picoseconds or nanoseconds. Like nanoseconds at worst, and picoseconds probably at best.
00:21:08.590 - 00:21:40.704, Speaker B: And latency over the public Internet is measured in milliseconds. So you're talking about a million to a billion xenore difference in latency. Given that, certainly training, I think, over the public Internet is not going to fly ever. I'm guessing there's no amount of software configurations that you can change that will make that the case for inference. That may not be. I think on inference, you can probably split things up in a more productive way. Again, I'm not an expert in these systems, but I generally think that will be true.
00:21:40.704 - 00:21:44.120, Speaker B: For training, it's going to be damn near impossible.
00:21:44.660 - 00:22:10.920, Speaker A: And on the inference, I mean, I think, for example, chat GPT-3 costs somewhere around like $12 million mark to train the model. But the inference cross of just the API request was like $700,000 per day. So I think long term, the money, I mean, depends on how many times you retrain the model. But just the inference cost to and from the model is where a lot of the long term money can be made substantially.
00:22:11.760 - 00:23:03.490, Speaker B: Oh yeah, without a question, the total amount of compute workload for inference will always be much, much larger than for training. Training is just unique because it requires so much hardware to be co located, and that has very weird effects on the distribution of the market as a whole, especially given that supply and demand are competing for the same hardware. Today, there's a bunch of teams working on specialized hardware, both for training and for inference. So this will fragment over time and become like the market will actually become more heterogeneous as the underlying hardware specializes. But yeah, in a market where they're competing for the same underlying hardware and the training, you just need to have whatever, 500 h 100s in a room. It just, yeah, the costs become very, very unmanageable.
00:23:04.840 - 00:23:50.460, Speaker A: Maybe last thing on the deep end topic, and then I would love to dive into the integrated kind of modular thesis that you recently put out, but I've talked with quite a few people now, and they're recently either more bullish or now starting to deep dive Filecoin. And in your recent talk at the multi coin summit, I think you said you hated it, but now you loved it. Can you kind of maybe double click on Filecoin and how it kind of not relates to deep end, but share more of your thoughts on why Filecoin is more, or how do you change your mind from kind of hating it to loving it. And what kind of caused that transition?
00:23:52.200 - 00:24:25.704, Speaker B: A few things I think happened. One was the network launched. My general rule of thumb for blockchains is it takes at least twelve months after they launched to do anything. And even up to 24 or so I started paying attention to file about a year ago, which was about two years after network launched. My assumption was hey, whatever was a cool thing and it's going nowhere. As I started to dig into the ecosystem, a few things became very apparent. One, the amount of storage on the network was enormous.
00:24:25.704 - 00:24:50.322, Speaker B: And two, demand utilization was growing. I was like okay, well that's the core of the thesis is like store stuff. So there's more space to store and there's more stuff being stored. So that's a pretty good sign. And the rates of growth of those in an absolute terms were pretty interesting. So that got me excited. Two, I learned about the launch of the FVM, which launched on March 14 of this year.
00:24:50.322 - 00:25:41.490, Speaker B: PI day the FVM allows you is the EVM on top of filecoin and it has additional bindings that connect to filecoin native primitives. So some of those primitives would be things like hey, is storage provider storing the file they said they would store? And hey, here's block rewards that are going to the storage provider, route them to this address. And obviously is the ADHD retrieval markets and bandwidth markets and compute markets. They'll add those bindings for those functions as well to the FVM. And so what the FM allows you to do is it allows you to have programmable devin assets basically. And that struck us as a pretty important breakthrough. Imagine the same way that bitcoin was there and then Ethereum allowed defi to exist.
00:25:41.490 - 00:26:27.780, Speaker B: The FVM. I think the Filecoin pre FM was inert and now post fvm is dynamic. And so I'd say those kind of combination of things are the things that I looked at Filecoin about a year ago and was like hey, something is here. In the twelve months or so we've been closely following the ecosystem, we've had a chance to attend a bunch of filecoin events, get to know a lot of members of the team. We have made our first investment that is explicitly a Filecoin native team. Can't announce it yet, but we got the deal done and are looking at a bunch of others. I've gotten pretty intrigued at the intellectual capital that's accumulating in the ecosystem.
00:26:27.780 - 00:26:53.120, Speaker B: It's definitely real and most importantly, it's differentiated all the people who are building around Filecoin, just like they're not degens at all, they're typically storage and distributed systems people. And so they come to things with a very different mentality and mindset. So that's kind of been, I'd say, our 180 on filecoin in a few minute summary.
00:26:54.340 - 00:27:26.140, Speaker A: On the demand side, I think a lot of people that have started to peer their head into the decentralized physical infrastructure networks see how the tokens incentivize the supply, but are still either struggling or not thinking long term enough. On the demand side, can you talk or share some of your thoughts on bootstrapping not only the supply side, but the demand side of the network?
00:27:27.520 - 00:28:35.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, generally, bootstrapping demand is a completely different activity than bootstrapping the supply. Bootstrapping supply is the core of DPIn, and obviously token incentives help make that capitalist cycle work. The demand side is pretty hard to talk about in general terms, because the demand side of helium is totally unrelated to the demand side of hivemapper, which is totally unrelated to the demand side of filecoin, or render hard to generalize, other than to say, know your customers, know what they want. In general, most customers for these systems are going to say, hey, how do I have an SLA when I'm facing this decentralized network kind of a thing? So be prepared to have a good answer to that and understand which segments of the market are okay with that answer and which segments are nothing. Then obviously focus on benefits. What's unique, maybe it's cost, maybe it's verifiability, maybe it's lower latency, whatever. But be very, very clear of the benefits of the DPIn model.
00:28:35.620 - 00:28:51.580, Speaker B: I would not highlight DPIn itself. Customers don't care about the DPin part. D pin is just the capital formation part. What they care about is the attributes of the system. Lower cost, improve performance, whatever makes sense.
00:28:52.240 - 00:29:27.848, Speaker A: Cool. Well, kind of moving on. You wrote a very good essay, ultimately breaking down some of the assumptions that the modular community has really put out into the ethos versus integrated chains. And I think it was very well articulated, really kind of around the first principles of what make blockchain scale and really kind of what drives fees. And I think it's very concrete that it's actually not modular. That makes fees lower. It's really state contention and bandwidth.
00:29:27.848 - 00:29:48.320, Speaker A: And I think that was ultimately just a narrative that got put out into the crypto universe fairly well and kind of has stuck around what was kind of some of the reception towards your essay. And has any new information kind of come to light that has changed any of your mind after publishing it?
00:29:50.220 - 00:30:50.330, Speaker B: Yes, I published it about two months ago. You know, there's a famous saying, Cunningham's law, which I used to employ. I really no longer try to employ it, although some of my critics may suggest that I am still explicit in it. But Cunningham law states the right way to get a question answered on the Internet is not to pose a question, but to pose the wrong answer. And based on this blog post, certainly got a bunch of commentary back from the folks at Celestia, primarily Nick White and then Neil Sumani, who is building eclipse, which uses Celestia. They walked through a bunch of very specific, technical, I guess, details on why my post was wrong or incomplete or something. I won't rehash those, other than to say, go listen to my podcast with Nick White and go look at the tweetstorm Twitter thread with Neil.
00:30:50.330 - 00:31:27.740, Speaker B: Went back and forth. My general takeaway, after getting a lot of pretty critical feedback from the folks on the other side, was that my core arguments are correct, if not perfectly technically, they are practically correct in the ways that matter. And I'd say looking at just like gas usage spikes on base, on arbitrum and such, even in just the two months since then, kind of reaffirms those core views. So overall views have not meaningfully shifted, but certainly have gotten lots of colorful feedback.
00:31:29.560 - 00:32:32.720, Speaker A: As I think we get lots of feedback on Twitter when we love to share some of our more controversial ideas, but maybe kind of double clicking into kind of the first principles of what actually causes fee spikes. One is kind of just how much bandwidth or how big are the blocks, are those blocks saturated? Once you hit saturation fees ultimately start to spike. So if you can either increase blocks or make faster blocks more block space, you don't have that problem. And then when two people ultimately try to access the same piece of state, someone has to access it first. And so you have some state contention. Do you feel like ultimately, over the long term, in kind of like maximizing bandwidth or data propagation? We'll go to, I'd say today, kilobytes to megabytes, ultimately fire dancer targeting gigabytes. Where do you see, like, the end state of this? Do you feel like it's a continuous, kind of always maximize the data throughput at the base layer at some point.
00:32:32.720 - 00:32:40.404, Speaker A: I think in our past podcast we talked about, you can only move atoms so fast around the world, and that's kind of some limitation.
00:32:40.452 - 00:32:57.076, Speaker B: There you go. Move bits so fast, which would be the speed of light. Atoms substantially slower than the speed of light. If atoms are moving at the speed of light, that is terrifying. That is a lot of kinetic energy.
00:32:57.268 - 00:32:58.000, Speaker A: Um.
00:33:00.660 - 00:33:50.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say, you know, the way my thoughts are evolving here, both general approaches will coexist. Um, uh, the solana approach will continue to focus on maximizing throughput, um, and by leveraging parallelism and customized networking. Uh, and then you'll have a bunch of people doing the, uh, you'll have a lot of celestiums or celestials or eigen das or whatever. I maybe they'll all be restaked, I don't know, using eigen layer or something, which theoretically makes everything tied to eth's economic security kind of, sort of. So that's one way it can play out. On the modular side, I think there's a lot of open questions if that will actually work in practice. I mean, certainly you can theoretically piece those pieces together and say it will work.
00:33:50.390 - 00:35:05.976, Speaker B: And obviously, I don't think anyone is breaking the laws of physics by suggesting it can work. But I think there are a lot of social configuration problems that we haven't even started to address because most of those systems aren't in production in any meaningful way. So we'll see. Does the market care if you have three da layers or 50 or 500? I don't know. What does that mean for bridging in terms of latency, gas cost, trust, minimization, et cetera? Are people going to fork optimism, op stack and arbitrary orbit and whatever else? And are those changes going to be meaningful? And then if so, how does that impact the respective bridging in those systems? So there's a ton of open questions there that are like, we aren't really going to be able to answer them definitively for probably another two or three years, perhaps longer. So I'd say it's just hard to say. Obviously, there's a lot of human capital trying to solve these problems, but the number of variables is very, very large, and those variables, the answers to each of those variables are tied to the systems, very path dependent.
00:35:05.976 - 00:35:17.290, Speaker B: So really hard to reason about it specifically. Both models will obviously coexist, but it's not even a question which model will be the simpler model for the outside world to understand.
00:35:18.870 - 00:35:50.590, Speaker A: Do you feel like outside of the kind of maximizing the data throughput at the base layer and isolating fees with local fee markets once those are implemented, do you feel like the biggest differentiations from the modular thesis to kind of the integrated thesis is that social component is reducing complexity overhead on the engineers, all the different connections that are being made outside of purely the technical point of view.
00:35:51.210 - 00:36:50.946, Speaker B: Yes, I think that's right. And I think most people underestimate the social costs pretty substantially. I mean, even things like when you want to go build on Solana or on Aptos or whatever, you don't think about questions like data availability is not even a word in your vocabulary that you think about at all. Do you want to tweak the evm? Which EVM fork do you want to use? Those are questions you don't think about at all. There's a lot of these things that add a tremendous amount of time and complexity to the development cycle that people don't want to think about. Modular maxes will say these are important for application performance tweaking. And my view is, look, man, windows and Mac make a lot of decisions on your behalf.
00:36:50.946 - 00:37:15.420, Speaker B: You definitely agree with 97% of them, and maybe you disagree with 3% of them. But there's value in the fact that the world's standardized on those two things, and I think the same will be true here. You can always gripe about how some things in the operating system or in the blockchain handles something in a way you don't like. But the value of standardization, I think, is extremely valuable.
00:37:16.800 - 00:38:14.170, Speaker A: It is, I think, hard to imagine a world where the demand for block space is even in 50,000 or 100,000, the daily active users is 10 million or 100 million. We're just very far from that world today, and these complexities haven't really shown face because we're really so small in terms of adoption. Do you feel like, I mean, ultimately these pieces are in place. Networks like Solana and the high throughput networks don't have these issues that earlier networks, smart contract platforms, have. What do you feel like on the application layer needs to have happen to take us forward? Is it next NFT iteration bull market? Is it more peripheral and deep in markets? Is there any specific user applications that you're excited or looking for?
00:38:17.990 - 00:38:59.090, Speaker B: Yeah, if you're talking about what's going to drive like 10,000 tps of block space demand, it's kind of how I'm interpreting the question. A lot of things that could be. One could be like large scale NFT collecting like artifacts across the Internet. I think teams like drip and dialects are slowly moving in that direction. I think that behavior is probably still a few years away, but I think we're moving towards that. Trading is the other obvious one, especially if you have an order book on chain, obviously that produces a good bit of block space demand. I think the reason Solana actually doesn't have as much block space demand for on chain order books is because there's just not that many assets people want on Solana.
00:38:59.090 - 00:39:32.342, Speaker B: I think that's changing here pretty rapidly. A bunch of teams are launching tokens, Jitto drift, Marginfi, Jupiter, Zeta, a bunch of these guys. So I think that'll quickly change, which will be great. Render's about to come to Solana, Ionet and other shortcut and launch tokens too. So that'll increase demand for block space pretty substantially. Then the other area is payments. Today, USDT on Tron is huge all over the world.
00:39:32.342 - 00:40:09.900, Speaker B: I think there's a bunch of people who are starting to work on things that you could broadly call global Venmo or some sort of defi neo bank, basically enabling people to have dollars on chain but still live their lives interacting in local fiat in whatever market that they're in. I think that's going to grow. I think that's going to accelerate pretty substantially in the next few years. The core infrastructure is there to facilitate this for on ramps and off ramps. The stable coins are there, the wallets are there. So I'm pretty excited about this opportunity, and I think that's going to drive a ton of demand for block space in the coming years.
00:40:10.420 - 00:40:56.060, Speaker A: Yeah, the tokens, especially on Solana, has been historically not the place, but I truly believe that it's primarily just a time function. Solana just being around less than the ethereums of the world is really coming into its own. I think a lot of people were hesitant or had reservations after FTX, what was going to happen? Clearly, I think the Solana community is having its 2018 2019 moment where everybody's rallying around it. And it's very interesting now that these teams are coming into age, the products are becoming more robust, and by having these tokens, more liquidity coming into the network as well.
00:40:57.720 - 00:41:17.100, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. A lot of these Solana teams just were early, and I'm actually glad they didn't launch their tokens in the bull market. So now's the opportunity and they're mature, they've got products, they've got human capital, they've got strong investor bases, they've got good brands. And now, soon they will also have good tokens.
00:41:17.600 - 00:41:52.030, Speaker A: 100%. Has your thought process around not modular specifically, but Ethereum changed at all over time? I think Ethereum has become obviously the first smart contract platform when people think about entering the crypto ecosystem. At least today the EVM and L2s are top of mind. Has your thoughts around that ecosystem or even L2s changed in any meaningful way over the last couple of years?
00:41:54.130 - 00:42:41.330, Speaker B: One more answer is no. The more nuanced answer is, um, you know, the Ethereum foundation has a fundamentally different set of optimization goals than Solana Foundation. Solana foundation, uh, has a few. One, Northstar is on chain c lab. Two, um, internalize complexity into the protocol so that you minimize complexity exposed external to the protocol. Three, on my mind, shoot, maximize use of available hardware. Let's say those are probably like the major ones.
00:42:41.330 - 00:43:35.870, Speaker B: Oh, and for like, not necessarily to run validator at home. And maybe one more that just slipped my mind. Anyways, I'll stick with those for now. Maybe one more I'm missing and I'll contrast those with the values of the Ethereum foundation, which are run validated at home. Minimize complexity in journal to the protocol Vitalik, Justin Drake a bunch of the others have been very clear publicly their goal is to minimize the complexity of the protocol and to push the complexity up and out. Three, there is no North Star application that they're optimizing for. And so those optimization vectors are substantially different.
00:43:35.870 - 00:44:58.420, Speaker B: And I think the biggest thing that has changed in the meta of the market, multicoin just turned six years old a week ago. And in the six years I've been doing this, the biggest change in the meta of the whole market, in my opinion, has been the zeitgeist has shifted from money crypto to tech crypto, or in simpler terms, from bitcoin is the only thing, and everything else is a bunch of shitcoins to, hey, there's an opportunity here to rebuild amazing parts of the Internet infrastructure using these technologies. And that zeitgeist shift, I believe will continue. I don't think the money crypto, I don't think this pendulum is going to swing back in the other direction because of the sheer number of the quantum of human capital all over the world building cool shit on Ethereum and Solana and whatever else. So assuming that progression continues, the system that is, generally speaking, optimized, optimizing for maximizing the tech application functions, is the one that's going to be best positioned in the long run. The Ethereum ethos encapsulates a lot of the, I'll call it money crypto ideas from bitcoin. Not all of them, but certainly some of them.
00:44:58.420 - 00:45:53.650, Speaker B: Solana. The only things that it carries forward are public key cryptography and permissionless consensus. And besides that, all other assumptions have been thrown out. I mean, even the notion of time in the system like Solana approaches differently, proof of history versus block updates. So yeah, the things guiding the development of these systems have been totally different for a long time. Those differences are starting to become, the implications of those differences in design philosophies are starting to become apparent to the market. And I think more and more people will come out on the tech practicality side of that than the money idealized side of that, which I believe is quite favorable for Solana and Aptos and other integrated systems.
00:45:54.070 - 00:47:01.670, Speaker A: I fully agree with that. It has been interesting how long it has taken the market, even today, to realize some of the things that you and the multi coin team identified early on with parallel processing, with needing high throughput, being able to allow more flexibility for engineers to create, I would say, more unique applications when you give them a larger sandbox to play in, when you have more data availability to build more interesting applications like a central limit order book, do you feel like as that window continues to shift from money crypto to technology focused crypto, and what type of applications you can build once the users come in, once it's demonstrated, look, new primitives are allowed to be built or can be built here. That window of the shifts from the early iterations of smart contract platforms to these more high throughput integrated chains.
00:47:02.970 - 00:47:07.870, Speaker B: I'm sorry Logan, what was the question? I didn't really follow the question, I guess.
00:47:09.930 - 00:47:57.490, Speaker A: What will be the shift today? The landscape is very ethereum focused, EVM focused L2s. If you talk with people outside of our point of view, they think it is not only certainty, but without a doubt that the Ethereum has kind of won this landscape and that these integrated high throughput chains have not lost. But there are some interesting things, but it is very clearly to them, not as active as the Ethereum world. I think you and I are very aligned to that. The Solanos of the world. The high throughput chains are going to be unique and allowing developers to build new things. But what will be the catapult for that kind of overturned window shift to these high throughput chains?
00:48:05.870 - 00:48:51.980, Speaker B: The way that the Overton window shifts is the market cap of Sol and aptos increasing versus the market cap of ETh. As I like to say, the most important feature of a token is its price or its market cap. I don't mean that in the cynical interpretation, but rather the optimistic interpretation is broadly speaking, the higher the market cap of something, the more legit the company is. And this is kind of universally true. Apple is more legit than peloton because the market cap of Apple is like 50 x or 100 x, whatever. The market cap of peloton. Not to say that peloton is not legit or whatever, I'm just picking on them, but you get my point.
00:48:51.980 - 00:49:30.500, Speaker B: And the same holds true in crypto. Bitcoin is more legit than ethereum, ethereum is more legit than Solana, et cetera. So then the upstream question of that is, well, what causes the market caps to basically the price of the sole eth ratio to go up? I think the answer to that is high profile applications that people can see very definitively. DeFi is cool, but also it's a casino. It's just circular money levering up to buy more Defi tokens. As Tushar likes to say. Defi is a second horizon activity, not a first horizon activity.
00:49:30.500 - 00:50:04.942, Speaker B: If you look at the evolution of the GDP and the economy of the world over the last 2000 years, finance was not the first thing that was invented. The first thing that was invented was trade. Trade my shoes for food or whatever. And finance started to emerge after the 14 hundreds with the Medici family. But really modern finance, modern finance, joint stock companies and stuff, like 17 hundreds. And then obviously industrial revolution is when it started to really become a thing. And crypto is funny because we invented crypto rails and we're like, cool.
00:50:04.942 - 00:50:32.416, Speaker B: What economic activities here? I don't know, but we can trade shit and lever up. Crypto just did the inverse of human history there. But as we undo that, I should say, as the world returns to its normal arc of economic activity preceding finance that will, I believe, drive the relative ratios of sole eth to higher number.
00:50:32.528 - 00:51:12.450, Speaker A: Go up, is unfortunately, or fortunately, the best marketing crypto. It is a signal not only to engineers, but also traders. Everybody kind of follows along. I think luckily, at least in my crypto worldview on Twitter, it definitely seems like the sentiment is changing. And it truly reminds me of the Ethereum moment in time where 2018 2019, that community rallied around and really built the core backstop of what happened in Defi summer and then ultimately catapult us into the next bull market.
00:51:12.910 - 00:51:24.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe Uniswap launched November 2018. Absolute pico, bottom right. So funny how beautiful things tend to emerge at the Pico bottoms.
00:51:24.940 - 00:52:06.080, Speaker A: True. In terms of maybe shifting the conversation a little bit. Multicoin is really famous and I think you specifically for kind of that first principles type analysis and continuously breaking down things into their core primitives. I love that style of thinking, I think, ultimately, it highlights a different point of view in the world that many have a hard time seeing. Case in point, integrative chains versus modular. But I'm curious, are there examples where you felt like something was obvious, but in hindsight, maybe it didn't work out as you anticipated?
00:52:08.220 - 00:52:46.020, Speaker B: I mean, lots of things have worked out as we anticipated. Um, I guess the one I'll highlight here is, well, I mean, we're probably most famous for Eos, so I guess I'll. I'll stick with that one. I got into crypto in 2016 because of Ethereum. Um, at the time, the word defi didn't exist. The word permissionless finance didn't really exist either. But when I learned, you know, how I could program Ethereum, the construct of permissionless finance entered my head, although I could not describe it that eloquently, nor did I appreciate the implications of it.
00:52:46.020 - 00:53:16.984, Speaker B: And then launched multicoin in 2017. And I remember vividly, I was at Devcon three in Cancun in November of 2017. This was Picotop, and Vitalik gave the keynote at Defcon three. He had published a plasma paper about two or three. It was, I believe, August 1, 2017, if I recall, or thereabouts. And obviously, everyone was talking about scaling. It was all everyone want to talk about was scaling, scaling, scaling.
00:53:16.984 - 00:53:51.308, Speaker B: And Vitaliks keynote had nothing to do with scaling, nothing to the sharding. It was like a history of Ethereum or something. And I remember I left and I was like, what is this? Since before Ethereum launched, they were talking about scaling. Like, at this point, Ethereum is two and a half years old, and all eyes are on Ethereum. It's November 2017, and not addressing at all the thing that everyone is thinking about. And that's when I was like, okay, I need to revisit my priors. And so did that.
00:53:51.308 - 00:54:34.270, Speaker B: And at the time, Solana was maybe an idea in Anatolia's mind, but maybe not even that yet. EOS was around and looked at the other things that were, I guess Tezos was around, although it hadn't launched. And I forget what else was around at the time, but dug into a bunch of stuff and got convinced that EOS was a very ideologically different approach and a very technically different approach, basically the opposite of Ethereum in a lot of ways. I got excited about that and ended up making a big bet there that ended up flopping pretty bad. But what we learned from EOS was not that the thesis was wrong, but that the team didn't execute and so stuck with the thesis and ended up working out later. So lots of, lots of fun learning.
00:54:34.310 - 00:54:48.790, Speaker A: Lessons on EOS, I guess, as a fund. I mean, it highlighted to you that the thesis can be cracked, but the team or just the ability to execute is not cracked.
00:54:48.950 - 00:55:11.170, Speaker B: Totally. I mean, being the guy who invested in Halo or in a bunch of other uber clones, you know, is just like, intellectually very painful. I mean, even like Tumblr, like, I look at USV, they invested in Tumblr and Twitter. Not that Tumblr was a bad outcome and now that Tumblr ended up working, but, like, man, if you were in Tumblr and not in Twitter, like, man, you would have been pissed. You know, like thesis, right, execution, wrong.
00:55:11.670 - 00:55:52.230, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess in terms of, I mean, being, starting multicoin, six years. Outside of that, are there any big lessons? I would say, one, selfishly, for kind of emerging managers that you could highlight, and two, on the flip flop side, for founders, what are some real world examples or feedback that you could give them to either raise in kind of these more challenging times, or just advice in general to founders.
00:55:55.250 - 00:56:25.100, Speaker B: Say, for emerging managers. Know your strike zone. Took us a while to figure out our strike zone. Be open minded about stepping out of your strike zone, and if you are going to step out of it, a limited to a fairly small percentage of your fund, and be very eyes wide open about how and why you're stepping out of your strike zone. But, you know, 90% to 95% of your fund should be in your strike zone. Um, and be very clear about what that is. Took us a while to appreciate that, both at the firm level and the fund level.
00:56:25.100 - 00:56:49.290, Speaker B: Um, for, for founders, um, biggest piece of advice is, uh, stay lean, man. Like, things can, macro can stay worse than you expect, longer than you expect, or I think, as the famous Warren buffett is, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. So be frugal, be lean.
00:56:49.790 - 00:57:25.364, Speaker A: Good advice on both ends. Well, I truly appreciate you coming on, Kyle, every time. I really do. I feel like I learn a lot. And I really believe the culture that you built at multicoin has allowed the firm to identify unique things ahead of other people, which to me is just fascinating. I think it's a very interesting way of thinking. It's not always fun, as we talked about in the last podcast, but it, in my opinion, allows you to view the world differently.
00:57:25.364 - 00:57:42.060, Speaker A: And I think as an investor, that's very important. Is there any particular things that you would like to highlight that you're either looking forward to in the next couple of years that you are uniquely excited about or just kind of your mind is open to.
00:57:43.560 - 00:58:30.986, Speaker B: Thank you for that. Logan, a little flattered. We're very fortunate to work with great founders and have a team that gets to learn from the founders. We do a lot of thinking internally, but I'll say a lot of our thinking is inspired from our conversations with founders. So thank you, founders, for providing inspiring thoughts in terms of what I'm looking for coming ahead, I mean, we tend to be fairly drawn to what I'll just kind of loosely call intellectual capital. So unique thinking in some form of form or fashion. I think there's a lot of opportunities in payments around the world in DPIn, so we're spending a lot of time on that stuff.
00:58:30.986 - 00:58:57.440, Speaker B: Consumer, there's a lot of people running experiments around social and other kinds of weird loyalty things. We certainly have been fairly active there. We did Blackbird, we did unlonely. We've done a bunch of things I can't even recall right now. Farcaster so we're spending a lot of time on consumer. We want to figure it out. And yeah, I think there's going to be some big consumer hits in the next few years.
00:58:57.440 - 00:59:01.640, Speaker B: So we're digging deep and looking for founders who have those unique insights.
00:59:01.800 - 00:59:07.020, Speaker A: Perfect. And where can people get in contact with you or the multi coin team?
00:59:08.000 - 00:59:21.000, Speaker B: Yeah, you can just email me. You can just kind of guess my email address. It's not very hard. Or you can just ping me on Twitter. My Twitter is my name at Kyle samani. K y l e s a m a n I. My dms are open.
00:59:21.300 - 00:59:25.440, Speaker A: Cool. Well, thank you again for coming on, Kyle, always a pleasure.
00:59:25.780 - 00:59:26.860, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks, Logan.
00:59:26.980 - 00:59:27.340, Speaker A: Thank you.
