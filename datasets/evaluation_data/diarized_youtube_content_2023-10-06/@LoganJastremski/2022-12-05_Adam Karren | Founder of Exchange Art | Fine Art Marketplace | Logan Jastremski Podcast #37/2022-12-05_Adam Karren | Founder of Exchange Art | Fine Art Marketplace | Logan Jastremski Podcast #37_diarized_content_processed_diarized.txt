00:00:00.200 - 00:00:05.654, Speaker A: Thank you, Adam. Super excited. Ultimately, first podcast that I've done in person in a while.
00:00:05.742 - 00:00:06.078, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:06.134 - 00:00:06.942, Speaker A: So thank you.
00:00:07.046 - 00:00:08.930, Speaker B: We're back. We're back in person.
00:00:09.710 - 00:00:25.862, Speaker A: It has been a while. The in person podcasts are just much more fun. So excited to do this one in person and ultimately be here in Miami, be here at Art Basel. I think it's an appropriate venue to talk about what you're doing and everything exchange art has been up to.
00:00:25.966 - 00:00:28.262, Speaker B: Definitely, definitely perfect.
00:00:28.446 - 00:00:48.054, Speaker A: So, ultimately, I think a lot of people are familiar with exchange art, but where I would like to start the conversation is just a little bit more background on who you are and how you ultimately got into crypto. I always find people's stories fascinating.
00:00:48.182 - 00:01:22.732, Speaker B: So I got started in management consulting, and I was at infosys consulting. I was at Bryce Waterhouse Cooper doing tech consulting there, doing strategy as well as implementation. And then throughout that time period with the ICO craze and then Defi, I was engaged in crypto, but I was engaged in crypto more as a passive user, not as somebody that was day trading Orlando, you know, building yet in the ecosystem.
00:01:22.796 - 00:01:23.440, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:24.140 - 00:01:24.972, Speaker B: Oh, go ahead.
00:01:25.076 - 00:01:29.148, Speaker A: So is that the, like, 2017 or.
00:01:29.284 - 00:01:30.148, Speaker B: In that time frame?
00:01:30.204 - 00:01:30.660, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:30.740 - 00:02:09.836, Speaker B: But it was more, like, passive. I wasn't, like, actively building anything or anything like that, but I was getting my feet wet with crypto. And then obviously the bear market, I was around, but again, very passively, and then really started to get excited about defi, liquidity, mining, yield, farming, all that great stuff. And then gas fees started to really increase with this whole NFT craze, and this is all on eTh. And then I was like, it's very annoying. This made defi less fun with all the gas fees.
00:02:09.908 - 00:02:18.144, Speaker A: Yeah. I personally paid $1,000 plus for uniswaps, and it pained me to do so.
00:02:18.312 - 00:03:11.880, Speaker B: It makes, like, gas fees make defi less fun for retail investors. Like, buy a lot. And so I started to think this makes no sense. And then I started investigating, like, okay, what are there other l one plays that have some characteristics beyond just the blockchain, but, like, surrounding ecosystem aspects, like wallets, et cetera, that, like, are differentiated. And so I found Solana, and I saw that, like, the NFT craze really hadn't picked up there, but I was like, I could see this actually making sense. And so I started minting all the things with, like, along with legends, like, all the things. And, you know, so I got a lot of the currency, I minted a lot of the things.
00:03:11.880 - 00:03:55.258, Speaker B: I was like, well, there's no open NFT marketplace. So I actually co founded Digitalize, believe it or not, which is the first open NFT marketplace on Solana. And that did really, really well. In the first 45 days, it did 150 million in gross volume. And then myself, Alex, Andre, Tibby and Horia actually left digitalize after 45 days after to start exchange art. One of the reasons we did that was we didn't see eye to eye with the other founder. The founder was doing nefarious things that y'all can look through all the threads around blue magician.
00:03:55.258 - 00:04:24.000, Speaker B: This won't surprise anybody. We just didn't want to associate or do business with somebody like that long term. And so we're like, there's no amount of money that makes it worth it. And so we left, started exchange art. And exchange art actually originally was modeled more off of like Opensea to some degree. It was a collectibles marketplace first and foremost with some digital fine art. But then at that .2
00:04:24.000 - 00:05:10.048, Speaker B: months had passed between when we left early September and I, when we launched October 31, there was a big consolidation that was going on in the market between magician and Alfard and there really wasn't room to navigate. And so we decided to do a hard pivot in the November, December. It was really like one month we saw it 30 days we're pivoting and we said we're removing every PFP that's generative from the platform. So we basically like removed 2.7 million tokens from the platform and focus fully on fine art in December. That's 2021.
00:05:10.144 - 00:05:12.940, Speaker A: It is a wild journey from ultimately.
00:05:13.800 - 00:05:18.776, Speaker B: And obviously I left my job. I was a director level below partner.
00:05:18.808 - 00:05:57.414, Speaker A: At Bryce Waterhouse, starting in consulting, ultimately kind of playing around in the ethereum ecosystem, figuring out it wasn't scaling and had a gas fees kind of being prohibitively expensive, ultimately leading to develop and look at other ecosystems. Finding Solana starting a NFT marketplace that did a lot of volume and then ultimately kind of changing course after some team members then heading to and ultimately starting exchange art.
00:05:57.502 - 00:06:16.344, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's funny, I didn't realize it at the time. ETH is great when I, it was great in 1819, 2021, it was great. It's great when what I didn't realize is it's great when there's not a lot of people using it on a.
00:06:16.352 - 00:06:20.384, Speaker A: Regular basis, which is unfortunate. Cause I think, I mean, ultimately, like, like they're smart.
00:06:20.432 - 00:06:28.740, Speaker B: Cause they're the defi on Eth is best in class. It is the most innovative. It is hard to say otherwise.
00:06:29.640 - 00:06:33.968, Speaker A: Definitely today, I think ultimately, um, which.
00:06:33.984 - 00:06:35.064, Speaker B: Is why it's unfortunate.
00:06:35.152 - 00:07:30.510, Speaker A: Yeah, I I think ultimately, like, going back to our early point, like, what excited me about Ethereum was the fact that you could have these permission line contracts, anybody could use them, and that essentially no one had control over them. But what kind of saddened me ultimately was that very few people, once the technology got adoption, could actually afford to interact with these things on chain. I really wanted Ethereum to work and Ethereum to scale with l two s. And I think ultimately, just after learning a lot, I think they're just taking a different approach. And I hope it works long term. But I'm personally just kind of more optimistic on other solutions in the industry. But, yeah, it is interesting.
00:07:30.970 - 00:07:47.572, Speaker B: I'm really not a blockchain, Maxi. I have used matic. I used it in DeFi 2021, and I just, it wasn't for me like, I used it. It was very, very complicated. It didn't operate like a proper l two. It wasn't for me.
00:07:47.636 - 00:07:48.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:48.820 - 00:08:04.692, Speaker B: You know, we'll see what happens with their, the gaming vertical. It seems like they've invested a lot of money in that, and that could work out potentially really well for them, you know, but for Defi, when I used it again, this was 2021, I was like, I'd rather just pay the gas.
00:08:04.796 - 00:08:16.652, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense. Um, kind of pivoting from, like, the core tech to, uh, digitalize. What were. I mean, had you founded a company prior?
00:08:16.836 - 00:08:18.956, Speaker B: Uh, I did a lot of, like, startup investing.
00:08:19.028 - 00:08:19.476, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:19.548 - 00:08:22.828, Speaker B: Uh, in the past, and I had done some, like, side hustles.
00:08:22.924 - 00:08:23.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:23.612 - 00:09:18.278, Speaker B: So how, like, an education, like an education startup. Uh, I had a. And basically we helped kids focus on, like, when you're in high school in America, basically, the high school career counselor, they don't focus on what you want to do. They focus on, you know, getting your SAT scores up and, like, getting into college, but, like, not the right college or figuring out what you want to do once you get into college. And what ends up happening is kids, because they don't know what they want to do when they get into college. They end up, you know, taking five years to graduate, which means they get an extra year of student debt. Because if you don't figure out what you want to do by the first year, you have to do summer class and all these other things, because all of these, like, majors require you to complete all the credits within the curriculum.
00:09:18.278 - 00:09:37.000, Speaker B: But oftentimes, kids don't know what they want to do because those aren't the conversations that people are having so they're not optimizing their college selection based on what they want to do with their life, which is pretty, which is suboptimal, to say the least. So that was what that was about, that startup, and it was good. We helped a lot of kids.
00:09:37.900 - 00:10:02.880, Speaker A: So you had a couple startups prior, but I would say this one was kind of an instant spark. What were some of the biggest learning lessons of just starting and seeing that early traction outside of the founder? Um, I would say mishap or incorrect founding team.
00:10:02.960 - 00:10:57.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, when you have, like, you know, in this case, digitalize at the very beginning was, I don't think people understand how far we've come into Solana, for one. So, like, at the very beginning, like, you, you can't let, like, you know, perfect be the enemy of good. And, like, digitalize at the very beginning was not good ux, by any means, it was not good on a lot of parameters, but it was first that was open because at the time, you only had an option with Solanart. And their strategy was to basically just curate whatever would come in. And I said, I'm going to let everything in, no matter what. Anything that's original comes in, I'm going to suck up all the liquidity. That was the strategy.
00:10:57.120 - 00:11:44.450, Speaker B: But we were going to basically, so we were the first marketplace, and actually magic Eden adopted the strategy as well. We were going to do something different than Opensea. We were going to basically say, you're either known or unknown. We're going to let everybody thing come in, but we're going to prioritize the known over the unknown, and we're going to market accordingly. And that's actually something that magicky didn't actually adopt it afterwards. And that was kind of a culture that digitalize said that, like, hey, anybody can sell, but, like, we're going to make sure that there's not just, like, copyments left and right, which is what, you know, as you know, opensea has a substantial problem on that front, and they're still trying to figure out how to solve it. It's a real, like, 30% of their listings are fraud.
00:11:45.550 - 00:11:53.078, Speaker A: Yeah. So was that kind of one of the biggest challenges that you found when starting that company?
00:11:53.254 - 00:11:59.970, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of bad people. Yeah, there's a substantial amount of people that want to commit fraud.
00:12:00.710 - 00:12:09.278, Speaker A: Interesting. So from those kind of learning lessons from digitalize.
00:12:09.374 - 00:12:10.050, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:11.790 - 00:12:22.398, Speaker A: What were kind of the biggest takeaways, I guess, in your opinion, and ultimately why you decided to kind of transition into the one of one art.
00:12:22.494 - 00:12:42.960, Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, collectibles are a different animal than digital art. Collectibles are highly, highly speculative. They are fad driven. So there's, quote unquote, some meta. We're calling it the meta, but it used to be called a fad back in the day. Used to be called a fad.
00:12:42.960 - 00:13:01.760, Speaker B: There's a whole rarity system associated to it. These are the distinct characteristics that enable their price appreciation. Yeah, aesthetics are, people say aesthetics are important, but they're really secondary. Let's be completely. It's all about price. Go up.
00:13:02.180 - 00:13:03.284, Speaker A: Number go up is good.
00:13:03.332 - 00:13:14.520, Speaker B: Number go up. That's what the focus is. And that's okay. There's a market for that. Collectible market has been around a very, very, very long time. EBay was built on collectibles. So it's not a new concept.
00:13:14.520 - 00:13:50.096, Speaker B: It's a new concept that's been, I guess, reshaped in the digital form, but it's not a new concept. There's a lot of energy that is spent, and that was one of the main reasons why I was excited about fine art, because it's like an entirely different type of energy in the community. There's more focus on aesthetics. The artist's statement on why something was created, how it was created. There's more passion in the individual work. Everything is rare. One of one art.
00:13:50.096 - 00:13:54.340, Speaker B: That's the big difference. Everything is rare. There is no rarity.
00:13:54.680 - 00:14:28.840, Speaker A: I like the distinction. Yeah, I think it's a brilliant description. Ultimately, you decided to go into this market, focus on individual creators of one on one. I guess, long term. How would you describe exchange art? What you want to do and the vision that you ultimately want to set out, and how do you want to empower those artists?
00:14:28.920 - 00:15:06.530, Speaker B: I guess I'll tell you a story that kind of sums it up. My mom, 20 years ago, after my parents got divorced, she wanted to go back to college to become a photographer and ideally sell in a gallery. She finished school, tried to get into a gallery, was unable to get into a gallery, had to go on to do commercial work. She actually worked with the Texans doing the green screens at the games where, you know, kids can kind of, you know, have like a background. Anyways, that was how she was able to make a ends meets. That wasn't her vision of what she wanted to do as a fine art photographer. But you've got to live, you got to pay the bills.
00:15:06.530 - 00:15:38.156, Speaker B: 20 years ago, the Internet was a different place than it is today. So exchange art's goal, its mission is to ensure that every single creator can make a living and remove the barriers that are present in the current our world. There are a ton of barriers on artists and those barriers extracted a substantial amount of value from the artist. The baseline is 50%. That's primary.
00:15:38.228 - 00:15:42.500, Speaker A: That's the baseline for being hosted in a gallery.
00:15:42.540 - 00:15:43.292, Speaker B: 50%.
00:15:43.396 - 00:15:44.196, Speaker A: That's wild.
00:15:44.348 - 00:15:47.092, Speaker B: And there is no secondary royalty.
00:15:47.196 - 00:15:47.828, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:47.964 - 00:16:18.720, Speaker B: So when you think about why these artists are flocking, it reminds me of why people flock to WhatsApp. It used to cost you a lot of money. Then it was free. They used to take 50%. Now they take less and you get a secondary royalty. The switching cost is very, very attractive. Digital art isn't a new concept, but its ability to accrue value at the pace of physical is what makes it so interesting now.
00:16:18.720 - 00:16:36.728, Speaker B: And that's really what I think nfts has done, is it's enabled the artist to be able to go to market directly in a more efficient way. It's enabled provenance to be far more efficient and effective for digital art, thus allowing it to accrue value. And then the third, and this is very important, is the hope of long term secondary royalties.
00:16:36.824 - 00:16:44.824, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I didn't realize ultimately that the gallery's kind of baseline was 50%.
00:16:44.912 - 00:16:45.786, Speaker B: It's a baseline.
00:16:45.888 - 00:16:46.342, Speaker A: Crazy.
00:16:46.406 - 00:16:49.170, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Real estate's not cheap.
00:16:49.630 - 00:17:20.528, Speaker A: Yeah, that is true. Wow. So that ultimately kind of, I mean, I guess your mother's kind of story, hearing kind of some of the artist pain, seeing Eth ultimately figuring out Solana and kind of solana cheap and Fastendez ultimately led you to exchange art after doing digitalize. And now the goal is to empower and say all creators.
00:17:20.624 - 00:17:52.370, Speaker B: Yeah. And my goal, and I tell this, I talked, I coach a lot of artists and we have over 8000 artists that are on exchange art. And in a given month we had, I think this month we had about 4500 sellers in November. That was with all the things that were still going on, but we had over 6700 buyers. So it balances out even. This is peak fear. So these numbers that I'm giving you was our peak fear numbers like the FTX stuff was going on in November, all these things.
00:17:52.370 - 00:18:47.880, Speaker B: So in spite of all the fear that was going on, these numbers were still very, very good. And so kind of going back to, you know, the future of exchange art and what we hope to do, we hope to broadly transform the art world. So digital is one area of focus. Ideally over time, as the people that are in crypto get older, they get houses, things like that. I foresee the physical market becoming also something that is very interesting as well. So we'll see what happens on that front. A lot of like, you know, it's funny, Haley, who's a curator, the chief curator of exchange art, she used to run a high end art advisory business, and oftentimes her customers were people that are buying houses.
00:18:47.880 - 00:18:50.188, Speaker B: You gotta put art on the wall.
00:18:50.244 - 00:19:35.762, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, you recently hosted, this past week, or this week, a gallery event in Miami, and appreciate the invite. Got to attend, but it was a beautiful event. Yeah, I think ultimately some people have a kind of preconceived idea of just like digital art, only being digital, but not being able to really manifest itself or be shown, and that's a little bit harder. And so what I really appreciated about the gallery was ultimately you kind of breaking that field, so to speak, and ultimately being able to highlight digital art in the physical world as well. And I thought it was a beautiful event.
00:19:35.866 - 00:19:57.930, Speaker B: Yeah, it was really great. We worked with some great sponsors. Solana, we had tokenframe, a mural by Netgear. So really, really great sponsors. And we had over 40 artists that we worked with. There's over 60 screens. And it was broken down into these basically fabricated rooms.
00:19:57.930 - 00:20:31.004, Speaker B: And we had a library, an arcade, a traditional living room, a more modern living room. And so you could kind of experience what it would look like in these different settings. But it was cool. One of my favorites, I think the library and the arcade were probably my favorite rooms. The library. We worked with the foundation that actually goes around the world and builds libraries in underprivileged areas. And we kind of collaborated to build that installation.
00:20:31.004 - 00:21:05.920, Speaker B: And it had Laura and it had Deejan poet with the typewriter. And so it was a really beautiful space. And then the arcade was cool because you had Zenom and you had atomape, you had the voxels with the pixels, and then you had the arcade, like the classic arcade Street Fighter and NBA jams. It was very, very fun space. And, you know, everybody that came, we had hundreds of people. Hundreds of people that came, and it was really great for them to experience. And we just, like, people were telling us, like, the best digital art gallery we've ever seen.
00:21:06.000 - 00:21:06.592, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:21:06.656 - 00:21:08.560, Speaker B: So really great reviews.
00:21:08.720 - 00:21:45.722, Speaker A: It was a really cool event. And being able to highlight that, those individual artists, it was awesome. Maybe ultimately going back to individual creators, there's definitely, as it exists today, many more, I'd say, traditional creators than NFT creators or digital art creators. A lot of people still skeptics, a lot of hurdles existed. There's many different blockchains. There's a lot of things to understand with, like private key management, getting a wallet.
00:21:45.826 - 00:21:46.202, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:46.266 - 00:21:55.190, Speaker A: What would you kind of tell or say to those artists that are on the fence or curious to learn more about, like, the digital world?
00:21:55.970 - 00:22:51.498, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so what I would say is, you know, what NFTs can do for you, what digital art can do for you is it can help you take back your business. Right now, you're relying on a lot of third parties to be able to make a sale, or you're relying on a third party platform that traditionally was more value extractive. So something like exchange art, our fees are 2.5% on primary and secondary, so very, very equitable with the artists compared to the current state. We also will, you know, we respect royalties as our platform and continue to kind of lead the way on that front. And we'll be adopting whatever standard does become the standard within Solana. I think there's five at this point that are competing, so we'll see where that lands as well.
00:22:51.498 - 00:22:54.750, Speaker B: Still form, reading, opinion. Love to hear your thoughts on that one.
00:22:56.410 - 00:23:06.820, Speaker A: I try to say out of the royalty kind of debate, at least for the moment. It is interesting. I mean, ultimately, I do think.
00:23:06.940 - 00:23:08.440, Speaker B: Do you have a standard you like?
00:23:09.540 - 00:23:53.178, Speaker A: Not at the moment. Legend has more opinions than I, but, yeah, it's. I mean, I do think it's an important problem, and one that, I mean, ultimately, if, whether people pay royalties or not, it should be explicitly stated upfront. You can't kind of tell people that royalties are going to be included and then later down the line, change that. Psych. Like, now royalties no longer exists and it's just primary sales. I think ultimately, if people opt into a certain standard, that's great.
00:23:53.178 - 00:24:03.290, Speaker A: If people don't want to opt into that standard, I understand that as well. But if you're opting into something, you shouldn't be able to have the power to change it down the line.
00:24:03.410 - 00:24:15.250, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I think, like the basis when you buy something. Right. You're agreeing to those terms, respect the terms.
00:24:15.330 - 00:24:16.034, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:16.202 - 00:24:26.564, Speaker B: And do I. But that's separate. Do I think collectibles should have a royalty? Is a separate question, but I think if they do put the royalties in and you decide to buy something, you should respect it.
00:24:26.652 - 00:24:41.124, Speaker A: I agree. Yeah. No, it is kind of an interesting debate, I think. Yeah, definitely one that these ecosystems ultimately will have to kind of navigate going.
00:24:41.172 - 00:24:50.484, Speaker B: Forward, because if you're a community based collectible project, you're not going to have revenue streams likely outside of, initially outside of royalties.
00:24:50.572 - 00:24:51.172, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:51.316 - 00:24:57.828, Speaker B: If you're like a utility SaaS provider, then that's a different ballgame. Right. Because then you can monetize.
00:24:57.964 - 00:24:58.388, Speaker A: True.
00:24:58.444 - 00:25:09.360, Speaker B: So it's interesting. It's a really interesting space. There's a lot of challenges on that side, but on the art side, the art is their business, and so royalties are important for that reason.
00:25:10.660 - 00:25:39.310, Speaker A: Yeah, totally agree. Ultimately, individual artists, or what would you say? People either like artists that are up and coming or artists that have been doing well in space. Could you highlight a couple of, maybe even things that you have been personally collected and. Yeah. Just share more about how the ecosystem is growing?
00:25:39.470 - 00:26:06.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think one of the best ways to get started. Um, what I, what I typically tell people to do is, you know, like we, if you're collecting for the first time, you know, start to, like, explore, look at the leaderboard, look at the different categories of art that we've got. Photography, 3d art, illustration, abstract art, so many different types and styles of art.
00:26:06.750 - 00:26:07.294, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:07.422 - 00:26:34.692, Speaker B: Start to figure out what you enjoyed. I. Right. Look at the leaderboard. Look at, you know, what are the top artists on a daily, weekly, monthly, all time basis? See what are they buying? I always sometimes like to, I don't, I don't like to just look at the artists, but I also like to look at what the artists that are in the top of the space are buying. I like to look at what the top collectors are buying. So I like to get a sense of that.
00:26:34.692 - 00:26:47.832, Speaker B: And that's how I start to form my opinions is what do I enjoy personally? I like to look at what other people are buying so I can discover new people. And you can do all that through exchange art.
00:26:47.976 - 00:27:05.292, Speaker A: That's awesome. Are there any particular artists? I know John Ley has done particularly well in the Solana ecosystem? Are there any artists that you think are doing unique work that you've found recently?
00:27:05.416 - 00:27:42.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, for example, like, Archie is doing very unique work. What he's doing, where he takes, like, pressed acrylic painting, digitizes it, provides digital effects on it, and then in his latest series, he adds an additional step where he actually animates the digital painting to create kind of a hypnotic effect. So I think that's really, really amazing work. I know he's minting. I think he just minted a piece, actually. So that'll be up for sale soon, but that's on the higher price side of the market. That likely probably will go in the two to 400 range of Solana.
00:27:42.402 - 00:28:05.846, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting. How. I guess so, going back just taking a step back. Is it digital art for art novices? Is it similar to the real art world where you do copies and editions? Could you kind of explain for the art novice, like how from like a to z, kind of how that works?
00:28:05.918 - 00:28:45.354, Speaker B: So it starts with a, you have this, the artist will create a piece of work. Then they have a choice, do I want it to be sold as an edition of one? So one of one, or do I want a multi edition? So prints is what the traditional art world on exchange art. We actually, again, broke the mold that Ethereum had where they said, well, these things have to be separate. They can't be on the same side. So we decided why we're gonna have them on the same site, because we believe that we should be, in a lot of ways, art infrastructure. We're providing the tools for artists to make a living. All of our smart contracts are, then none of them were forked for Metaplex.
00:28:45.354 - 00:29:25.634, Speaker B: All of them are custom code. And, you know, it's one of the reasons why I actually think we rose to the top, you know, and to take out the incumbent and become the incumbent was because we actually made our own contracts. But that's how I would look at it. Right. You have, you can buy a one edition or a multi edition. And what's really fascinating, and this is something that I started to see, is that artists that have had really great prices start to price out normal people. And so they use the additions to create this accessibility.
00:29:25.634 - 00:30:07.680, Speaker B: And as those additions sell out, their secondaries increased for their one of ones. So the more demand for accessible prices there were, the more demand that translated actually on their one, on one side. So these things work together. It's almost like an additions acts as like the social token, the creator token, in a probably a more efficient and effective way when you think about it, right? Because it's like you're buying the art, you're becoming a fan more so than owning a social token that doesn't represent the content and the passion that these people have. Does that make sense?
00:30:07.760 - 00:30:08.328, Speaker A: Oh, totally.
00:30:08.384 - 00:30:22.152, Speaker B: I think there's this, I know you've probably seen the creator economy socialize the social tokens. I think the additions are, in fact, tokens, and I think they are far more effective at indexing the price of the creator.
00:30:22.256 - 00:30:42.016, Speaker A: That makes sense. And I think you said it beautifully. Ultimately being able to bring on additional fans, kind of helping your distribution, and just ultimately letting more people know about your art and kind of increasing your provenance in the art community.
00:30:42.128 - 00:31:10.530, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely beautiful. Because this is like the part that's so different. Right. When think about it like the distribution model of the gallery world, artist starts, tries to figure out how to get into a gallery, gets into a low tier gallery, crushes it, hopefully gets into a higher tier gallery, crushes it, and finally maybe gets into an international gallery. So regional, national, international gallery. But it has to start at the artisan level, typically speaking. I see, right.
00:31:10.530 - 00:31:44.006, Speaker B: So the artisan level is before you even get into an, you know, an entry level gallery. So that's kind of what's super interesting about this world is you're kind of having to claw your way up, and that's how this distribution model works. But in web3, in this digital art world, you build your community, you build this network effect, and then you sell your art. The bigger your network, the easier it is going to be to sell your art. You now have to own sales and marketing in this world, and you get more money for it, but you also.
00:31:44.038 - 00:32:01.742, Speaker A: Have more work that makes sense. And I think, I mean, I've talked with some artists and some of them are like, I only want to focus on art and don't really necessarily want to do that. I guess that comes at ultimately that. Do you want to pay that 50%?
00:32:01.846 - 00:32:03.630, Speaker B: Well, I think there's also going to be new models.
00:32:03.710 - 00:32:04.110, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:04.190 - 00:32:49.288, Speaker B: So I do think that there's going to be models where it's 15% to 30% fees on somebody handling the sales and marketing. But at the end of the day, in this world, the artist still matters. The artist still has to be visible, because you're not just buying the art when you have a living artist, you're buying the artist as well. The difference between a living and dead artist is the living artist can speak true, and the living artists can make mistakes. So when you're buying art, right, like, how artists manage supply, how they market, how they act, all that matters because it can change part of the story. Like, you have more, like a dead artist can't create more supply true.
00:32:49.464 - 00:33:16.970, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe talk a little bit more about the community building prior, because I do think that's different and something that's unique, that's kind of flipped from the traditional art market. So for people, again, like that are interested in being like, more digitally native artists and getting into this space, what would your recommendations be on the community side to try to build that fan base even prior to dropping digital art?
00:33:17.010 - 00:33:44.474, Speaker B: I would say you have to have a Twitter, because whether people realize it or not, the buyers are on Twitter, crypto Twitter. That's why they call it that it's important to build an audience where there are buyers and Twitter has an overwhelming dominant position. Like, no, no social platform at the moment is close to where Twitter is with these crypto users. I mean, it's pretty nuts.
00:33:44.602 - 00:33:45.710, Speaker A: What about Reddit.
00:33:47.970 - 00:34:00.932, Speaker B: For defi? Sure. Yeah, I used to use Reddit for defi, but like, for nfTs, scripted Twitter all the time. What are your thoughts on that?
00:34:00.996 - 00:34:05.036, Speaker A: No, I mean, I think to me, I would definitely agree, ultimately.
00:34:05.108 - 00:34:07.440, Speaker B: Is that fair? Defi loves Reddit.
00:34:08.620 - 00:34:42.550, Speaker A: Reddit, to me is more exploratory, where you have lots of different opinions and everybody can kind of come in and chime in. And I do like the voting model. But ultimately, what I appreciate about Twitter is that you can have interact with people that have spent a lot of time thinking about a different point of view and being able to express that. And I don't know, what about Twitter kind of makes that, if it's just like the retweets or the likes or even the, quote tweets with the dunking.
00:34:42.630 - 00:35:06.286, Speaker B: I think it's the ephemerality of it. So while you could go to somebody's profile and it's all there, that's not how typically people, like, consume. They consume through the feed. And the feed is like designed in a way where it's like, what did I just tweet? Yeah, I forgot what I just tweeted. I just spent an hour on a tweet thread and I don't even remember what I tweeted. That's literally how Twitter is designed. That's the medium itself.
00:35:06.286 - 00:35:17.526, Speaker B: It's instant, it's short. You move forward. Even the long form content via threads is still, you still have the same in Tau day. Read it and then I forgot. I just read it.
00:35:17.638 - 00:35:27.722, Speaker A: Yeah, I am interested now with Elon kind of taking over and expanding more. They said they're going to do more, be able to do more long form content and video. And video.
00:35:27.826 - 00:35:30.354, Speaker B: So I started doing video because of Elon.
00:35:30.442 - 00:35:30.858, Speaker A: Nice.
00:35:30.954 - 00:35:35.386, Speaker B: It just also happened that Frank also did it right after Elon made that announcement.
00:35:35.578 - 00:35:36.658, Speaker A: That's funny.
00:35:36.834 - 00:35:50.258, Speaker B: But I think he's going to be prioritizing videos substantially more. It makes total sense. And I think that, like, Twitter is in a really interesting, when you have a burning platform, quote unquote, you can do a lot of very interesting things with that burning platform.
00:35:50.354 - 00:35:50.788, Speaker A: True.
00:35:50.874 - 00:36:10.576, Speaker B: You know, you're not held down by traditional models, how you made money. And so, like, Twitter is going to do a ton of experimentation and I think they're very well positioned to be able to attack the creator economy. I think, like the, the one that has the strongest position is probably YouTube.
00:36:10.768 - 00:36:11.232, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:11.296 - 00:36:13.928, Speaker B: The amount that they pay creators right now is pretty substantial.
00:36:14.064 - 00:37:02.542, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. No, I think that may be kind of an interesting rabbit hole to go down, too. I mean, creators more broadly, even outside of just like, digital art, are really constrained right now. If you want to own more of your essentially revenue, you have YouTube. I think TikTok pays slightly. I know Snapchat is trying some stuff, but they do take a large chunk of kind of the money that you do make. And so I personally am super excited about what you're doing at exchange art to ultimately allow creators, artists, anybody that really wants to make a living online and share that art more accessible.
00:37:02.646 - 00:37:34.946, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, people are going to continue to create. Our focus is in non generative work within the exchange art brand. We have another company that's under our holding company called Codecanvas, and that'll be the first long form generative art platform on Solana. Equivalent would be like FX hash on Tezos or Artblocks on Ethereum. That would be the chain equivalent.
00:37:35.058 - 00:37:35.950, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:37:36.570 - 00:37:44.946, Speaker B: So we are excited about that. And having a dedicated platform that can actually do that, we're really excited about that.
00:37:45.018 - 00:37:45.910, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:37:47.850 - 00:37:49.610, Speaker B: So that'll come out next calendar year.
00:37:49.690 - 00:37:50.930, Speaker A: Perfect. Very cool.
00:37:51.010 - 00:37:51.670, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:53.370 - 00:38:26.290, Speaker A: So ultimately, lots of things have been happening in crypto the last, I would say, six months. Yes, quite a bit, yes. How would you kind of. To people that are still looking to collect art today, what would kind of be your thoughts on, or like, what would some of your thoughts on the recent events that you would share with them? Is now a good time to still continue collecting? And then maybe more broadly, do you see this kind of affecting artists today?
00:38:26.590 - 00:38:46.160, Speaker B: I'd say the famous saying Warren Buffett once said, when people are fearful, be greedy. When people are greedy, be fearful. This is the time to buy, because people are fearful. It is not financial advice. It's just the truth. Like the. We're in the midst of a digital renaissance.
00:38:46.160 - 00:39:10.220, Speaker B: Art history is being made on a daily basis. You know, take it with what you want. Like, there's a reason why Christie's is here right now. There's a reason why Sotheby's is here right now. Not in five years, right now. So you can start to buy things now at a price that later you will not be able to afford.
00:39:11.680 - 00:39:14.432, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm so excited about.
00:39:14.536 - 00:39:18.912, Speaker B: I'm getting things that I should not be able to afford at affordable prices.
00:39:18.976 - 00:39:19.696, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:19.888 - 00:39:22.980, Speaker B: How very exciting.
00:39:23.520 - 00:39:43.042, Speaker A: And do you think ultimately, I mean, I guess lots of things happening. But from the creator side, do you feel like, or have you seen that, like, the recent events with FTX or Luna has changed people's minds on collecting digital art more holistically?
00:39:43.146 - 00:39:48.946, Speaker B: No. We have had every month more and more people that are buying and more and more people that are selling.
00:39:49.018 - 00:39:49.870, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:39:50.930 - 00:40:06.000, Speaker B: And we still have more buyers than sellers. Yeah. I mean, this month total, we had over 20,000 connected wallets, which is a record. So again, we're hitting records during all of this.
00:40:06.120 - 00:40:06.880, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:40:06.960 - 00:40:12.984, Speaker B: And we were born in the bear market. We weren't born in the bull market. I've never seen the bull market with fine art.
00:40:13.072 - 00:40:13.648, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:13.784 - 00:40:20.470, Speaker B: One day I will witness the light, but for now, the next year or so, I'm still in the darkness.
00:40:20.560 - 00:40:50.972, Speaker A: Yeah. So in the beginning, ultimately, you mentioned essentially doing Defi on ETh. It was a little bit more challenging just with the gas fees. Ultimately, you chose Solana. But today there is a lot of nfts, and I would say rare art on the Ethereum ecosystem. And you said ultimately that you don't are not a chain. Maximus, do you have plans or ever feel like exploring other communities as well?
00:40:51.076 - 00:40:55.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think, like, again, like, my whole goal is to all of it should matter is the art.
00:40:55.660 - 00:40:55.988, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:56.044 - 00:41:16.638, Speaker B: I'm not saying providence isn't important. It's absolutely important. It's without provenance, there is no value. But realistically, ETH is not going anywhere. It's going to be around. Solana is going to be around the things that the better. The like, one chain doesn't have to fail for the other to succeed.
00:41:16.638 - 00:41:44.672, Speaker B: This is the continued mistake that people make, I think I want EtH to solve its problems. It has a lot of problems, and if we can't talk about the problems that it has, it'll never improve. Same thing. Solana had a lot of problems. We had to talk about it as a community. Solana Labs and the open source contributors that worked did an amazing job to get us to where we are. But if we didn't talk about those problems, we never would fix them.
00:41:44.672 - 00:42:20.028, Speaker B: So I think, like, you know, there's a lot of zealots and back pumpers and a lot of the times, these people are very dishonest about the facts. You know, the reality is a lot of the people that are on Solana never used Ethereum in their life. And if they did use Ethereum at the current state, they would never use it again because they're more normal. On the normie side, then, you know, some of the people that were like, btc to eat, I was eth to soul. And it's like the people that are on soul are used to fiber optics. They're not going back to dial up.
00:42:20.084 - 00:42:20.720, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:22.380 - 00:42:25.596, Speaker B: Do you ever ask yourself, do you want dial up Internet?
00:42:25.788 - 00:42:28.300, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you see what I'm saying?
00:42:28.340 - 00:42:48.806, Speaker B: Once, you know, once you have the high speed, you don't ever want to go back. And it's like, so, you know, again, I really want eth to solve its scalability problems. And I know it will never be as fast as Sol because of the trade offs that I've made, but I still would love for it to solve some of its problems.
00:42:48.878 - 00:43:00.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it totally makes sense. And ultimately, I loved your framing. One chain does not need to fail for the other to succeed. And ultimately, it is about the artists at the end of the day. Yeah.
00:43:00.534 - 00:43:22.310, Speaker B: I mean, I'd like to see an abstraction at all levels. We're seeing with wallets, backpack. And I think Phantom's now doing it soon, too. This idea that, like, I shouldn't have to switch browsers to access a website. You know, unfortunately, metamask really hasn't innovated that much. You know, that's kind of the status quo over there. Really.
00:43:22.310 - 00:43:44.548, Speaker B: That's the theme. But you look at the Solana builders, they operate like it's network fast. And the level of, like, we have feature parity with competitors on ETh within one year, and they've been around four or five, six years. You look at Magic Eden, same thing. One year they've been around, they're already at feature parity with something that's been.
00:43:44.564 - 00:43:46.452, Speaker A: Around five years, arguably much better than.
00:43:46.476 - 00:44:20.054, Speaker B: Opensea in many ways. So I think when you look at the builders on Solana and you look at the cultural thumbprint of the network, because I think that matters. You know, when we. When I was doing transformations back when I was at PwC, we'd always look at the cultural thumbprint of the organization so that we could devise a strategy that would work with the culture when we were doing a transformation. Because if you go against the grain, it'll fail. And so, like, if you look at the culture of Solana, it's built fast. It's built real fast.
00:44:20.054 - 00:44:21.822, Speaker B: And on occasion, we break some things.
00:44:21.926 - 00:44:22.278, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:22.334 - 00:44:25.622, Speaker B: But we move very, very, very fast.
00:44:25.766 - 00:44:26.406, Speaker A: I agree.
00:44:26.518 - 00:44:38.718, Speaker B: And I think that's good. And, like, again, if you look at the outcomes and the results. We're at 50% of super Air's USD volume and ETH is 94 times more expensive. That should tell you a lot.
00:44:38.894 - 00:44:39.690, Speaker A: True.
00:44:40.030 - 00:45:14.384, Speaker B: And like, you look at like magic Eden, same kind of story. But the. And there's always going to be wash trading, especially on the collectible side, we don't really have it. On the fine art side, we don't really have the. The degree of botting on fine art is substantially less than the degree of botting on because there's even botting on, like sniping on listings, that doesn't happen. On fine art, that just doesn't happen. They might bought a drop, a really high drop for additions, but they don't bought the listings itself.
00:45:14.384 - 00:45:19.036, Speaker B: Once they're like on secondary. They'll definitely do that though. On collectibles.
00:45:19.148 - 00:45:53.686, Speaker A: Makes sense. Interesting. No, it's a fascinating new world. I mean, I totally agree with your thoughts. No, ultimately, I would say I'm inspired by what you and the team at exchange are doing. Excited that ultimately, I mean, one, that the story's kind of so personal, kind of with your mother ultimately having some issues with her art and then really trying to give really the power back to the artists and the individuals through this technology.
00:45:53.838 - 00:46:19.480, Speaker B: And one of the cool things is we now enabled pay by ETh. So basically, if you're an ethereum collector and you're like, I just don't want to bridge my currency, deal with it. I want to support the artists. I have a phantom wallet, but I don't have any soul in it. Great. Now you can connect your metamask pay with ETH, and then the sole NFT can sit in your phantom wallet.
00:46:19.940 - 00:46:20.684, Speaker A: Nice.
00:46:20.852 - 00:46:40.200, Speaker B: So that's really, really exciting. And it'll get even simpler when more people are using backpack, or when more people, or when phantom actually adjusts and uses the cross chain, which they announced.
00:46:40.780 - 00:47:01.600, Speaker A: Very cool. I am inspired. Again, I love the event that you guys hosted here in Miami for art Basel. I think it was beautifully put, highlighting individual artists, highlighting and being able to take back ultimately ownership of their art.
00:47:02.100 - 00:47:04.596, Speaker B: I want to ask you a question, if that's okay. I'm going to flip the tables.
00:47:04.668 - 00:47:05.500, Speaker A: Go for it.
00:47:05.660 - 00:47:14.870, Speaker B: What do you think? You know, Solana has to do in order to create upward price movement?
00:47:15.730 - 00:47:16.658, Speaker A: Just in general?
00:47:16.794 - 00:47:31.074, Speaker B: In general. Because, you know, the backdrop is right now, people think ultrasound money is what matters. But the problem with ultrasound money is nobody will use it then.
00:47:31.202 - 00:47:31.650, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:31.730 - 00:47:51.102, Speaker B: That is an economic fact. This is why every single fiat system has inflation. There's a reason they have inflation. Because people won't spend the money. This is not a theoretical construct. So you're either a store of value or you're not.
00:47:51.206 - 00:49:19.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I think personally with ETH, I mean, ultimately they wanted to focus on scalability, but I think got slightly distracted or ultimately made the set of trade offs wherever decentralization was such a high priority that they wanted to, they did not explore trade offs of looking at how can we still preserve a high degree of censorship resistance, have a high number of full nodes, but still have high throughput and high transaction account. And so I think it's fine that they've optimized for that. I just don't think it will actually be able to onboard and support the hundreds of millions and billions of people that ultimately I want to see blockchains get to. And to answer your question directly, I think Solana ultimately is on the correct path. Their technology is pretty sound, in my opinion. I mean, especially with fire dancer, with essentially in my mind to address these problems, it's all about users. And so if the technology underlying suite is at least directionally correct, which I believe it is on the solana ecosystem, and there is a very clear path forward with increasing data availability, with having more throughput and firedance, I believe is targeting 10gb/second which is crazy, because ETH with sharding is going to be doing 1.3
00:49:19.790 - 00:49:20.730, Speaker A: megabytes.
00:49:21.750 - 00:49:24.410, Speaker B: That's with an mb versus a GB.
00:49:24.830 - 00:49:25.446, Speaker A: Yes.
00:49:25.558 - 00:49:33.790, Speaker B: Mb difference versus. What does that mean, though? Because a lot of people might not know what that means, they may not understand what data propagation means.
00:49:33.870 - 00:50:29.122, Speaker A: Yes. So ultimately, blockchains are bottlenecked by how many transactions they are, essentially how many transactions can be fit in a block. So because you have to achieve a consensus, you need two thirds plus one vote in the worst case scenario for the nodes to agree upon the state of information. So ultimately, if you can propagate more data, so the number of transactions you can fit in a block, and to do so, you're physically, actually constrained in the world world by the bandwidth between nodes. So if you can propagate or have higher data bandwidth between nodes, ultimately you can have bigger blocks. Some people would argue this is bad for decentralization, but I mean, bandwidth is super cheap. So in my point of view, it's probably one of the cheapest things to optimize for.
00:50:29.122 - 00:50:33.124, Speaker A: We could get into a whole conversation about all twos and whatnot, but I.
00:50:33.132 - 00:50:35.440, Speaker B: Know people don't believe in big blocks.
00:50:36.660 - 00:51:15.106, Speaker A: Ultimately, like, I mean, really, it's been interesting, like going down the jump rabbit hole, because ultimately they're designing a system that essentially is ingesting. I mean, ultimately looks very similar to, I mean, just a high frequency trading firm where they're ingesting 100gb and just parsing that data and then doing trades on that. So ultimately you want kind of a continuous data stream. But I think from the user perspective, they shouldn't care about any of the tech stuff, just like you shouldn't care about what the IP address is.
00:51:15.178 - 00:51:18.250, Speaker B: All they care about is do I have dial up or do I have high speed?
00:51:18.330 - 00:51:19.110, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:51:19.450 - 00:51:26.818, Speaker B: Is the settlement time 15 minutes to an hour or even 8 hours if it's bitcoin or is it 3 seconds?
00:51:26.874 - 00:51:27.186, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:51:27.218 - 00:51:28.300, Speaker B: That's all they care about.
00:51:28.450 - 00:51:48.632, Speaker A: Yeah. And so, yeah, ultimately, to answer your question, I really just think it's user adoption and being able to get more people in the ecosystem more broadly. Right now there's a lot of infighting just because there's not that very many users. The pie grows very fast in crypto and then shrinks just as fast.
00:51:48.696 - 00:51:49.112, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:49.216 - 00:52:13.772, Speaker A: So I think in the time of expansion is where people will actually flood into these ecosystems that can support high throughput and ultimately, as you mentioned, fiber optics like technology instead of dial up. And so once that does happen, I think we'll see more artists, we'll see more applications. The sandbox for engineers just becomes much bigger.
00:52:13.836 - 00:52:20.628, Speaker B: I'd say for us, in a year and a half, we will be very, very ready for an influx of users.
00:52:20.764 - 00:52:23.506, Speaker A: I'm confident that will happen to, in.
00:52:23.538 - 00:52:56.794, Speaker B: Ways that have not. And I think magic Eden will do the same. Just to be clear, in hyperspace and all of these different companies with different verticals, the thing that I'd love to get your perspective on is beyond just building the solutions and marketing. Beyond that, what is the narrative that you think Solana needs to have in order to make it to the next bull market and be in a better position to capture sufficient market share because this FTX stuff has been dragging.
00:52:56.882 - 00:53:25.024, Speaker A: Yeah. Ultimately, the biggest critiques that I hear is that it's not decentralized or the network downtime. And I understand both and why people will ultimately think that the third one was ultimately Solana's vc chain. I think kind of with FTX out of the picture and those tokens being locked up for the foreseeable future, that is kind of one that's also a.
00:53:25.032 - 00:53:32.656, Speaker B: Dishonest critique, but yeah, yeah. Because how are you going to raise money if you're a blockchain today and not go to jail? What happened with Ethereum can never happen again.
00:53:32.728 - 00:53:33.304, Speaker A: That's true.
00:53:33.392 - 00:53:35.616, Speaker B: It's a very dishonest criticism.
00:53:35.768 - 00:53:44.826, Speaker A: I do understand it, but, I mean, now it's removed, it's less valid. But the other one is just that it's not decentralized. And I think they're just.
00:53:44.928 - 00:53:49.510, Speaker B: At what level is it critique? Because obviously there's a spectrum. Yeah.
00:53:49.550 - 00:53:52.014, Speaker A: So I think actually at the network level.
00:53:52.102 - 00:53:53.166, Speaker B: At the network level.
00:53:53.318 - 00:54:13.168, Speaker A: And here, what I find is most people don't understand from an engineering point of view what decentralization means. And I think Anatolia actually does a beautiful job of articulating this. And so that ultimately is the number of full nodes, because as long as one individual copy exists, you can recover the state.
00:54:13.254 - 00:54:13.596, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:13.668 - 00:54:37.180, Speaker A: Um, and then again, going back to. Because in consensus, you need two thirds plus one vote to achieve that consensus. How many independent nodes would it take to clue to kind of achieve 33% or greater? Um, because if you can do that, you can start essentially not vote or censor transactions. And once you get to two thirds, then you start taking control of the network.
00:54:37.260 - 00:54:37.620, Speaker B: Right.
00:54:37.700 - 00:54:49.444, Speaker A: Um, and that, that's called the Nakamoto coefficient. So on the Solana side, they have, I think, over 3200 full nodes with RPC nodes, which is about half of actually what Ethereum is.
00:54:49.492 - 00:54:52.828, Speaker B: I think it's 1850 plus 1300 RPC nodes.
00:54:52.964 - 00:54:59.548, Speaker A: So even higher. But yeah. So the Ethereum people like to also include, like, lite clients.
00:54:59.684 - 00:55:00.532, Speaker B: That doesn't count.
00:55:00.636 - 00:55:09.164, Speaker A: Which don't count technically. They can help, but, like, it's. It's not apples to apples. And full nodes are the one thing to, like, actually care about.
00:55:09.252 - 00:55:16.932, Speaker B: What is sufficiently decentralized? This is a question that I like. The answer can't be like, it's never enough.
00:55:17.076 - 00:55:17.760, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:18.780 - 00:55:21.188, Speaker B: By the way, even ETH has a limit.
00:55:21.324 - 00:55:21.796, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:21.868 - 00:55:43.864, Speaker B: There's only so much supply and you have to have 32 EtH for a full node validator. Correct. So it's like, okay, you even have a limit. Right. So if it's never enough, then you see what I mean? Like, there has to be a limit or there has to be an agreement. That. Is it a thousand? Is it 2000? Is it 3000, 5000?
00:55:44.032 - 00:55:44.400, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:44.440 - 00:55:45.208, Speaker B: What's the number?
00:55:45.304 - 00:55:47.592, Speaker A: No, it's an interesting question.
00:55:47.656 - 00:55:48.240, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:48.400 - 00:55:49.240, Speaker A: I definitely agree.
00:55:49.320 - 00:55:50.408, Speaker B: Because it's a moving target.
00:55:50.504 - 00:55:55.320, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, ultimately, I don't know.
00:55:55.360 - 00:55:58.580, Speaker B: I mean, his Anatolia brains with this, I'm curious.
00:55:59.000 - 00:56:02.808, Speaker A: Ultimately, I think his goal is to get to, like 10,000, maybe 20,000.
00:56:02.944 - 00:56:19.380, Speaker B: 10,000 is very sufficiently decentralized, I would believe, disentangled. And, like, if you think about Solana and I, like, I really started to do a lot of research on this because, like, I just want to, like, what. What's the noise versus what's reality? I mean, like, AWS is only about 20% of the bare metal.
00:56:19.460 - 00:56:20.140, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:20.300 - 00:56:21.900, Speaker B: On the network, I believe.
00:56:22.020 - 00:56:22.388, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:22.444 - 00:56:26.140, Speaker B: And it's less than 25% is geographically located in the US.
00:56:26.220 - 00:56:26.452, Speaker A: It's.
00:56:26.476 - 00:56:31.220, Speaker B: It is from, like, if you compare weighted stake, which is what matters.
00:56:31.260 - 00:56:31.524, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:31.572 - 00:56:36.398, Speaker B: In proof of stake. I feel like Solana, in many ways, is actually more decentralized.
00:56:36.574 - 00:57:11.662, Speaker A: I personally would argue that it's very close. So I think ultimately, to your initial question, like, how can Solana ultimately get this new narrative? I think it's forming. I think, again, it's just kind of getting drowned out by some of the noise. But eventually, the truth will prevail. The product and my point of view is extremely sound. It's just about, again, getting the truth out there and then telling the story. What ethereum, I think, does beautifully is telling their story.
00:57:11.662 - 00:57:18.158, Speaker A: They're very good at telling their stories, and they've been reiterating the same thing over and over and over. I think Solana, ultimately is.
00:57:18.334 - 00:57:42.800, Speaker B: They have ultrasound money. What's our meme? This is what, that extinct dinosaur? I love that extinct dinosaur. Honestly, the guy, 89 reals, has had an extraordinary amount of good ideas recently. The open book idea. That's a brilliant idea. I mean, seriously, very controversial, but good. I love that extinct dinosaur.
00:57:43.300 - 00:57:47.280, Speaker A: Well, we're coming close up to time. I wanna.
00:57:48.340 - 00:57:49.404, Speaker B: We can cut that part out.
00:57:49.452 - 00:58:18.916, Speaker A: No, no, it's good. Yeah, ultimately, no. Yeah, I think. I am personally very excited about Solana, and I really try to be objective as possible. And a lot of. I mean, I've talked with many founders now, many of the people actually building the protocols, doing very deep technical talks with them. And I'm very excited for Solana and, like, trying to be the most objective of possible.
00:58:18.916 - 00:58:52.026, Speaker A: I think they've made the correct decisions. And so I think Solana will find its footing and will find its narrative. I'll try to continue to do my part, but ultimately, I think I'm excited for the day where application engineers do not have to think about protocols like yourself. Users don't have to think about it. They can just ultimately use the cheapest, the fastest one that suits their needs, and people can have the functionality of blockchains and what they're supposed to be used for.
00:58:52.098 - 00:59:26.710, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question. We don't have to record it if you don't want the coinbase wallet controversy. Do you see it where Apple wants to take 30%? Do you think this is actually the main thing that's holding back adoption, is that the duopoly between Google and Apple and preventing. Like, people don't understand this. I tell us to creators, they don't know this. They asked me, why don't we have a mobile app? I said, well, let's say you make $100, you sell for $100. Well, Apple gets 30, exchange gets $2.50,
00:59:26.710 - 00:59:31.658, Speaker B: and then you get the remainder. They're like, what? And I said, no, that's how it works.
00:59:31.794 - 00:59:32.510, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:34.890 - 00:59:36.190, Speaker B: Isn't that crazy?
00:59:36.490 - 00:59:56.172, Speaker A: It definitely is crazy. I mean, ultimately, it's definitely holding back crypto and crypto adoption. There's no question about it. Ultimately, whether Solana mobile stack sells 10,000 phones or 10 million, I would still consider that a success because people, it's kind of a conduit.
00:59:56.356 - 01:00:01.180, Speaker B: What's stopping banks from being charged 30% for a wire? What's the difference?
01:00:01.300 - 01:00:03.276, Speaker A: I agree. Yeah.
01:00:03.388 - 01:00:17.014, Speaker B: You see what I mean? It's like the danger of what is happening with mobile phone duopoly, I think is one of the biggest problems of our time. From a tech perspective. From a tech competitive landscape perspective.
01:00:17.142 - 01:00:42.872, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it could be a whole separate conversation, but we can cut that part out. No, no, it's good. We could keep going, but need a wrap. But no, I really just want to thank you. Excited for what exchange art is doing, excited that you're powering creators, excited about digital artists, and, yeah, I appreciate what you're building and thanks, man. Thanks for your time.
01:00:42.976 - 01:00:59.752, Speaker B: Definitely. It was great to be here. And again, exchange art is going to keep building during this bear market. We're going to keep rolling out innovative solutions like pay by ETH. We've got some really, really exciting stuff that's coming in December. Like some people kind of power down for the holiday. We're powering up.
01:00:59.816 - 01:01:05.008, Speaker A: Nice. Beautiful. I think. Great way to end on. Let's all power up.
01:01:05.144 - 01:01:06.496, Speaker B: Let's go, let's go.
01:01:06.648 - 01:01:07.360, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks.
