00:00:00.920 - 00:00:03.774, Speaker A: A long time coming. A couple hours coming.
00:00:03.862 - 00:00:08.570, Speaker B: It's okay. It's okay. It will get better over time. You'll get into, like a second.
00:00:09.190 - 00:00:21.862, Speaker A: All right, so this is the first podcast. Laura has been super grateful and patient with me as I've taken probably 2 hours to set up this podcast. But thank you.
00:00:21.926 - 00:00:26.982, Speaker B: Well, I'm learning for myself, so that's good. It's good to watch you so I don't do the same mistakes.
00:00:27.126 - 00:00:37.998, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Learning together. So maybe where should we start? Since this is the first podcast I.
00:00:38.014 - 00:00:43.330, Speaker B: Can just do, I think we just start with you. Who are you first and what are you trying to do?
00:00:43.710 - 00:01:12.994, Speaker A: Sure. So my name is Logan. I kind of did the traditional tech background stuff, but got into the crypto scene 2017, but throughout that, kind of kept with it now have gone full time in crypto and trying to learn from other smart people. So, yeah, I guess that's like a super brief background. We could probably get more into it later, but we will.
00:01:13.082 - 00:01:14.058, Speaker B: Absolutely will. Yeah.
00:01:14.114 - 00:01:15.322, Speaker A: Let's chat about you.
00:01:15.506 - 00:01:37.358, Speaker B: So a bit about myself. So, yeah, my name is Laura. I currently I work at Ledger prime, which is a multistrad fund and a bit of my journey in crypto. I guess the first time I heard about bitcoin was back in 2013. My business school had an ATM machine on campus.
00:01:37.494 - 00:01:38.078, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:01:38.134 - 00:02:03.858, Speaker B: And I was trying to withdraw cash, and it was at one of the restaurants on campus. And the owner of the restaurant told me, no, this is. This is not a regular ATM machine. This is a cryptocurrency ATM machine. At that point, I was like, what? Cryptocurrency isn't like you talking about digital money. Isn't the euro pretty much digital as well, right? Because of all the bank transactions. And, yeah, I didn't really give it that much thought, like, back then.
00:02:03.858 - 00:02:45.072, Speaker B: I mean, I wish I did, right, but I just. I remember thinking about it for a little more and just talking about the exchange rate then and what it was, but I. Yeah, I just forgot about it until 2017. I was lucky enough to go to a school that we did have some classes that mentioned blockchain a few times, and we had a few. We did, like, a few projects and whatnot, and we researched a little bit on it. But it was not until 2017 that I moved to Boston for grad school. And then there I took a class, and it was in cybersecurity, where they put together law students and computer science students.
00:02:45.072 - 00:03:22.436, Speaker B: I went. I did Cs in grad school to write papers on some framework that anything that we wanted to choose that the us basically had. No, not a lot of regulation on it or not that much. So my team, we actually did not talk about crypto. We talked about bioweapons, which is very different. But cryptocurrencies, no, but I had to grade a paper from someone that actually wrote it on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. That was 2017.
00:03:22.436 - 00:03:34.732, Speaker B: And then from there. Yeah. Started like, I guess dipping my toes a little bit, buying here and there, whatnot. And a year or two later, I decided to move full time into crypto.
00:03:34.796 - 00:03:35.284, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:35.372 - 00:03:44.304, Speaker B: I first worked at Ledgerx, which was the first CFTC regulated exchange for bitcoin options and futures.
00:03:44.352 - 00:03:47.520, Speaker A: Was that directly out of your master's program?
00:03:47.600 - 00:04:01.656, Speaker B: No, out of my master's program. I first worked in consulting for a year, and I don't regret it because it taught me a lot of process, but it was a painful year.
00:04:01.688 - 00:04:02.328, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:02.504 - 00:04:16.800, Speaker B: And then actually throughout my masters, I got involved with the crypto community in Boston and I became one of the members at Wemoney Blockchain and. Yeah. And then just organizing events together.
00:04:17.540 - 00:04:26.556, Speaker A: So is that. That kind of, like, allowed you to, like, get introduced more so, into meeting interesting people in the crypto markets?
00:04:26.628 - 00:04:35.700, Speaker B: Exactly. So I got pretty connected with the crypto community in Boston, and they just. They would just, like, blow out my mind every day.
00:04:35.780 - 00:04:36.534, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:36.732 - 00:05:12.656, Speaker B: Great people, very smart people, great conversations. And I got more and more interested in crypto also, because before grad school, I worked in Amsterdam, the market maker for environmental commodities. And that was the whole point for me of going to grad school. So I worked in that company because I thought that environmental commodities were actually doing something good for the world in a way. But through working there, I realized that it's a compliance product that kind of, like, makes more harm than good. Like, the idea behind, remember, commodity is really good, but applied is actually. It's really.
00:05:12.656 - 00:05:52.596, Speaker B: It hurts a lot of, like, small and medium sized companies. So my idea was to study computer science, specifically data science, in grad school. So I could build some, like, environmental models or some financial models to show other ways of basically, I guess, like saving or improving the environment that is not through this compliance, financial products that. Yeah. So anyway, so when I. When I got to grad school, just like life, right. I ended up learning more about crypto and I figured that that would be a better way or that I could make a better contribution there to make the world a better place.
00:05:52.668 - 00:05:52.988, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:53.044 - 00:05:57.684, Speaker B: Kind of like cliche, but that's the. Yeah, and now look at us 2022.
00:05:57.812 - 00:06:14.588, Speaker A: That's awesome. That's a cool story. How has it been? Kind of like, I guess for the people that don't know these specific companies that you have worked at in the past, could you just give like a brief overview of each and kind of what they kind of contribute to the different communities?
00:06:14.684 - 00:06:44.438, Speaker B: Yeah. So starting with Ledger X. Yeah. One of the reasons why I actually like that company over all the companies that I was looking to work for is because they recently launched. When I started there, they had just launched what they call minis, which is a smaller contract size of bitcoin options. So up until then, on their platform, the contract size of an option was one bitcoin. It was also 20 1920 1817.
00:06:44.438 - 00:07:10.226, Speaker B: So the price was very different than today, but that was the contract size. And it was also most institutional. They didn't have access to retail, retail then. But then when they launched the retail platform, together with that, they also really, they also launched the smaller contract size. And even in other options platform like Darabee, the contract size is 0.1, I believe so, yeah. So it was still, like smaller than anywhere else.
00:07:10.226 - 00:07:40.688, Speaker B: And it's also tailored to the US customer because it's a regulated platform. So I kind of like the idea of democratizing finance. Right. And giving access to everyone in the market. Also, one different thing or one different characteristic between equity options and crypto options is that equity options, they have a hundred multiplier. Right. So when you buy one stock or one call option, you're actually committing to 100 stocks.
00:07:40.688 - 00:08:02.624, Speaker B: But in crypto, there's no multiplier. So it really allows you to, from one side, build a directional position and from the other side also just like build a position yourself depending on how you are trading these options. Right. So I like that. And it was a very cool opportunity because a very small team and I was able to see a little bit, like, from the front to the back of the business.
00:08:02.752 - 00:08:03.264, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:08:03.312 - 00:08:26.880, Speaker B: I work really close with the CEO as well as the VP of sales and operations. And it was a great year. I mean, that was throughout 2020. So it was beautiful to see the growth of the platform. We did like between 15 x and 20 x growth in terms of users throughout the first year of COVID I guess. And, yeah, it was a lot of fun. A lot of fun.
00:08:27.620 - 00:09:35.380, Speaker A: I mean, I think one of the things that I've been amazed by as a whole is just how much crypto grew during the year of like 2020 and 2021. Yeah. What were you doing actually during 2020? Yeah. So I left Tesla at the end of 2020, I was working there on their supercharging division, but I realized that even as much as Tesla worked, you couldn't out compete, like, composability. And composability is just like those kind of like, open API calls. I admire your background much more in the, well, the tech and the finance side because I'm more social trying to learn the finance side, but the tech, from the tech standpoint, I was just amazed about how quickly you can iterate and how these applications can kind of be building blocks for each other. And then, so for the year of 2021, just kind of became a full time investor in the space and kind of became obsessed with the layer one blockchains and how those scale.
00:09:35.380 - 00:10:15.432, Speaker A: So, yeah, I put a lot of focus and emphasis on that because like you said, I think if you can actually democratize this for the vast majority of people, they become much more interesting, more so that everybody can use them right now, kind of starting with the complex products that your teams are working on and then continuing to, like, not dumb it down, but continue to offer, like, different product suites over time like that everybody can use. I mean, I think that's kind of what I've been interested in.
00:10:15.616 - 00:10:27.480, Speaker B: So, yeah, so 2021, did you speak, spend, like, basically the year just reading? And what happened in 2021?
00:10:28.220 - 00:10:53.760, Speaker A: Yeah, 2020 was super interesting. I started off in California. I moved back to California. I was there for, like, six months, and then everybody kind of was talking about Miami, I'm sure, as you saw. And Miami kind of looked like a cool place to live. So I decided to move to Miami for the second half of the year, and I've really come to enjoy it. I appreciate that.
00:10:53.760 - 00:11:07.996, Speaker A: It's crypto forward, and there's a lot of sun, there's a lot of interesting people like you and a lot of founders that I've met in Miami as well. And so it's been, I've appreciated Miami so far.
00:11:08.068 - 00:11:14.660, Speaker B: I enjoyed that. About Miami. Yeah. When I first moved here was, I first came here in March for a couple weeks.
00:11:14.700 - 00:11:15.480, Speaker A: You were early.
00:11:16.230 - 00:11:51.544, Speaker B: I was early ish, I guess, but I was not that early. Some people came here directly December 2020 just because it was nice to be here outside and stuff. Yeah, but I came here March 2020 for a couple weeks. I had a friend that he had a, yeah, he, they were staying here, so stayed there just to feel a little bit, the vibe. And I, at first we were in South beach, and it was during, like, spring break, and if you all remember, it was all over Twitter. How crazy it got. They actually had to, like, shut down the bridge at some point.
00:11:51.544 - 00:12:13.424, Speaker B: Like, yeah, it was. It was pretty crazy. So we were there, and at first I was like, wow, do I really want to live here like, this? This looks kind of crazy, right? Like, this is not a place where I want to bring my parents. Right? Like, I don't want them to see this. They're not gonna enjoy it, so. And then one, like, a few days, I came down to Brickell, and I. It felt like, I don't want to say, like, New York, but a little bit more.
00:12:13.424 - 00:12:41.738, Speaker B: Something that I would enjoy or, like, I would transition through before I go to South beach or somewhere else. Yeah, so, yeah, so that's. Yeah, and then I was living in LA, so I went back to LA for, like, a month to wrap up my. My stuff there. And then I moved to Miami in May. And then the beginning was nice because that was right before the bitcoin conference. So that was a very, I guess, the very, very first conference after, like, after Covid and where, or, like, whatever.
00:12:41.738 - 00:12:54.482, Speaker B: Like, people were flying in and stuff, and so a few of them came here before bitcoin, Miami, and then others, like, stayed after. So it was a really, really fun first month and a half in Miami.
00:12:54.546 - 00:12:54.858, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:54.914 - 00:12:56.874, Speaker B: And then suddenly everyone left.
00:12:56.962 - 00:12:57.322, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:57.386 - 00:13:29.292, Speaker B: So it was kind of depressing for a couple weeks because nobody was in the city anymore. They all left for New York or whatnot. And then I went to New York for my birthday, and it was so fun that I ended up, like, staying longer, and it took me a little bit to come back to Miami, but, yeah, now I'm enjoying it. It feels a lot more people have moved down here, especially since you moved. Like, I feel like August onwards. Yeah, there's been another, like, migration, especially probably because people don't want to be here in summer. Yeah, I would not be here in summer.
00:13:29.292 - 00:13:34.456, Speaker B: I think I'm not even gonna be here this summer. So going back to New York, probably Europe, for instance.
00:13:34.488 - 00:13:34.712, Speaker A: Okay.
00:13:34.736 - 00:13:35.616, Speaker B: Yeah, nice.
00:13:35.808 - 00:14:12.326, Speaker A: One of the things that I've been impressed by or just, like, have kind also, like, I think is kind of wild is just how much people in the crypto industry travel. And I guess, like, as someone that has kind of traveled a lot to these different places and been to many different conferences, and I got to see many different points of view. How has that kind of shaped your thoughts on, like, the crypto industry or what do you find is unique about that versus other industries?
00:14:12.438 - 00:14:48.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that the trouble comes also, because even though the industry is growing there's still very few of us working full time. Right. So it's part of the business development, sales, part strategy, whatnot. And it's nice. Sometimes it feels like you're just meeting up with the same people in different locations, but it's also a way to build community and build trust with the people you're traveling with. And it's also a way to just spread the word. Right.
00:14:48.210 - 00:14:56.580, Speaker B: There are sometimes few companies. I always end up enjoying these conferences because you always meet a few people that you wouldn't meet otherwise if you stay in your city.
00:14:56.660 - 00:14:56.988, Speaker A: True.
00:14:57.044 - 00:15:22.916, Speaker B: Even if you try to schedule a meeting, sometimes it's like easier to bump into someone and then just have a conversation and schedule something later. So the way also crypto is global, right? Someone was, someone was asking me yesterday, what is the crypto headquarter like? Where would you say tech is? Silicon Valley. Where would you place crypto like the headquarter? I'm like, that's a good question. I mean, what would you say?
00:15:22.988 - 00:16:25.650, Speaker A: I mean, selfishly right now I'd say Miami, but, yeah, but outside of Miami, I would just say it's dispersed. And that's one of the things that I more so appreciate that you don't have to be in a specific location and those opportunities are provided globally, where in the past, I would say like even prior to like 2017 or really until this past year or a couple years where like, you were supposed to be in Silicon Valley. And I appreciate that that is no longer the case. And that has, that norm has shifted because it's kind of idiotic now with all the technology that we have that you have to be in a specific one place. And I appreciate that crypto has kindly push the bar so far that anybody in the world can contribute. And these conferences are global, so I appreciate that they are. It's cool that they think globally instead of just one geographic location.
00:16:25.730 - 00:16:56.736, Speaker B: I think that's one of the things I like the most about crypto. Right. The remote aspect of crypto. And then even before 2017 or so, it was, it's always been a pretty mobile industry. Like all the 8th conferences, they were always in different places and people gather in different places. And also the developer community is all online, right? So even themselves outside of their full time jobs before crypto, all the forums and stuff, like, you have people responding from everyone in the world. So I love that aspect of crypto.
00:16:56.736 - 00:17:03.088, Speaker B: Yeah, there's good brains everywhere, right? So a great way to connect all of the brains together for sure.
00:17:03.224 - 00:17:23.376, Speaker A: So I guess maybe to bring the conversation back to more. So, like, what you have been working on currently, could you dive in? I guess, like, a little bit more deeper? I mean. So you touched upon, I think, Ledger X.
00:17:23.408 - 00:17:24.536, Speaker B: Ledger X, yeah.
00:17:24.688 - 00:17:27.340, Speaker A: Do you want to, like what happened after Ledger X? Yes.
00:17:27.920 - 00:18:05.830, Speaker B: After Ledger X, I actually got a great opportunity to join Paradigm, which is an electronic OTC network for crypto options and futures. And just to give some stats, paradigm, I'm not sure exactly the numbers right now, but until I left, they did around 30% of the global options volume for bitcoin and ethereum, which is. It's nuts. I'm assuming now it's even bigger. Yeah. So really great team. I was there for about a year, and, yeah, it was great personal and professional growth.
00:18:05.830 - 00:18:26.372, Speaker B: But at some point at the end of last year, I started realizing that I had spent some time on the infrastructure exchange side, and I understood that side really well. And then I also understand the institutional space and crypto really well. I felt it was time for me to go at the fun side. Right?
00:18:26.436 - 00:18:26.908, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:27.004 - 00:18:53.412, Speaker B: And then. Yeah, I mean, last year, I guess for everyone, it was a really, really crazy year. I also needed a little bit time for myself. I had barely seen my family in two, three years because of COVID I went home for my sister's wedding over summer, and it was just, like, also crazy with growth and stuff, with the company that I was barely able to, like, spend time with them. So I felt I own it. I owed it to myself and my parents, who just.
00:18:53.516 - 00:19:01.900, Speaker A: I feel like you and I could have, like, a whole separate future conversation on another podcast. Just about, like, crypto and mental health.
00:19:01.980 - 00:19:13.740, Speaker B: Oh, gosh. Yeah, no, I'm all for it. Yeah, I. Yeah, that's. That's really important. We should definitely touch it on time, but you should dedicate time for yourself because otherwise.
00:19:13.780 - 00:19:15.360, Speaker A: Fully agree. Fully agree.
00:19:15.750 - 00:19:32.614, Speaker B: Especially think the two of us. I mean, at least myself, I'm someone that, if you invite me out, I'll, like, I'll never say no to something. Right. Because it's just, like, fun or you don't know who you'd be able to meet or. Right. Like, it's. It's not even fomo at that point, but it's just so nice to be with people in this space that I just.
00:19:32.614 - 00:19:33.590, Speaker B: I don't want to say no.
00:19:33.670 - 00:19:34.166, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:34.278 - 00:19:46.040, Speaker B: And most recently, I started to say no, but, yeah. So from there, I took a little bit of a break and spent time with my family. Actually, the first time, I spent, like, five weeks home with my parents.
00:19:46.080 - 00:19:46.664, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:19:46.752 - 00:20:35.430, Speaker B: The first time in my life it was besides, of course, when I was younger, right? Yeah, yeah. And then I joined, I joined Ledger prime, who I already know Ledger prime from my Ledger X days because. So Ledger prime was a market maker on Ledger X and yeah, so from there also hedge fund. So. Well, the fun has grown right now into different strategies and now we're focusing a lot on like OTC dashboard options and treasury management. And while those are basically my focus for the year and yeah, it's great, I already knew most of the team from the Ledger X days. And then just because I've always worked with them also paradigm, they were market makers of paradigm and just, well, crypto, so small that you end up always hanging out with them.
00:20:35.430 - 00:20:39.134, Speaker B: And yeah, was really close with the whole team, so it felt like the right move for me.
00:20:39.222 - 00:20:40.646, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah, nice.
00:20:40.718 - 00:20:44.774, Speaker B: And a few of them are in Miami, others in New York, so it's good. I say them pretty often.
00:20:44.862 - 00:21:04.970, Speaker A: That's awesome. I guess I don't know about market making as much. Could you go a little bit deeper into what market making kind of entails and how ledger prime kind of provides that service?
00:21:05.090 - 00:21:30.866, Speaker B: Yeah. So market making, a few words, is just providing liquidity on exchanges or any decentralized protocol or. Yeah, anything that basically needs liquidity in very simple terms. But, and there's a, you can provide liquid at different levels, right. In our case, we focus on options. I'd say like 90, 95% of our market making strategies go through options. That's where our expertise is.
00:21:30.866 - 00:22:33.166, Speaker B: And where also the team, the founding team, they already had a really good background on electronic market making. And, yeah, so options, futures spot like, those are the main products where in general, I would say like market makers specialize or one, or the other one. In our case, we started on the option side and then something that you see a lot with market makers and liquid providing is that a lot of them end up also, by the way, I say like the natural curse of crypto, that's how our OTC desk came to existence. Because in our case, after market making, all these exchanges, people start knowing about you and then they reach out to you on the site and they ask you to price you to price different assets or digital assets and then also different structures. Right. So when you, in general, when you market make on these exchanges, all these different exchanges, you do it via API and then you connect the, you connect the strategies that you run on those exchanges with your risk models.
00:22:33.238 - 00:22:33.774, Speaker A: Gotcha.
00:22:33.862 - 00:23:04.326, Speaker B: And then I'm not that familiar with like the spot side, but at least on the driver's side or on the option side, that also leverages a lot of your long and shorts and all the different greeks and stuff. So it also depends on the thesis of the fund. In our case, we started pretty much delta new neutral when we launch a fund, and now we're taking somehow with more direction. But it's mostly. Market makers are like, mostly delta neutral. Right. Which means that the way a market maker makes, like, their business model is from the spread between buying and selling all the time.
00:23:04.398 - 00:23:11.910, Speaker A: Gotcha. And I guess it's to. I mean, the more liquidity, the tighter the spreads can be, or.
00:23:11.990 - 00:23:27.400, Speaker B: Exactly, yeah, exactly. The more liquidity, the tighter the spreads are. And that's something that you see a lot right now. So for on the option side, bitcoin, ethereum, of course, are the two digital assets that have the most liquidity. And even so, it's not even that liquid.
00:23:27.440 - 00:23:27.904, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:28.032 - 00:23:45.064, Speaker B: It's probably one of the most liquid markets in crypto, but there's still a lot of work to do there. And when you start pricing other assets, you have like, yeah, the spreads are a lot wider because also the vaults are a lot higher and it becomes a little bit more complicated. Yeah, gotcha.
00:23:45.152 - 00:23:52.240, Speaker A: So, yeah, so, so Ledgerx is primarily just focused on the institutional side. Do they have a retail side of it?
00:23:52.240 - 00:23:57.304, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. So Ledgerx has both institutional and retail. They started with institutional in 2017.
00:23:57.432 - 00:23:57.800, Speaker A: Okay.
00:23:57.840 - 00:24:02.648, Speaker B: That's when they got the licenses on the CFTC. And then 2019, they launched a retail platform.
00:24:02.744 - 00:24:09.864, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. And both of those just took off. I'm sure during the last couple of years they did.
00:24:09.912 - 00:24:57.552, Speaker B: So what is actually interesting about Ledgerx is that, well, now, of course, last October, FTX acquired Ledger X, so now it's FTX US derivatives. But what's actually interesting about Ledger X is that you hear a lot of conversation about, oh, there's no liquidity, there's no volume. It's grown a lot ever since inception. But also, if you compare, because the other regulated exchanges in the US or the other one that has some volume is CME. And CME on the future side, they're actually pretty solid. And on the option side, if you compare the volume to Ledgerx's volume, it's not that much bigger. And then one thing to note as well is that CME has margin through the fcms.
00:24:57.552 - 00:25:09.612, Speaker B: Right. So you can't trade directly in CME. You need to go through fcms like trade station and other. Yeah, fcms. And then. But you can do it directly on on Ledger X. Right.
00:25:09.612 - 00:25:32.292, Speaker B: But Ledger X does not have Margin and that's something. A couple days ago, actually, the CEO, Zach Dexter, he announced that they are actually for the first time they submitted a request to CFTC to allow 24/7 margin. Oh, that in the US, this has never, it's the first time it's ever existed. Also because it's. I mean, it's a 24/7 market, so it makes sense.
00:25:32.356 - 00:25:32.764, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:32.852 - 00:25:56.616, Speaker B: So once, hopefully, if that's approved soon, we'll see a lot more volume going through Ledgerx or FTX derivatives and. Yeah, that's also allowing margin is also very important for market makers because for a market maker, for us, it's a lot more expensive to market make on platforms that are fully collateralized.
00:25:56.708 - 00:25:57.380, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:57.920 - 00:26:05.976, Speaker B: So, yeah, that will. It's also worse for like the buyer, the seller, because the premiums are a little higher because of that.
00:26:06.048 - 00:26:23.168, Speaker A: Okay, very interesting. How do you personally kind of think about like the decentralized, like, finance space that's still kind of like closed source versus like Defi and like, just like protocols themselves?
00:26:23.344 - 00:26:28.400, Speaker B: Is it more like how are we gonna move not market making c five defi?
00:26:28.480 - 00:26:38.496, Speaker A: I guess just like how do you view, like Defi versus like trad five versus like, kind of like the hybrid approach or like bridging the gaps with.
00:26:38.528 - 00:26:48.144, Speaker B: Like Ledger X in between Tradfi and Defi? Yeah, somehow. But then in c five, you also have offshore and onshore exchanges, right?
00:26:48.192 - 00:26:48.512, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:48.576 - 00:27:15.882, Speaker B: And that's another big question. Are saying what's gonna win onshore or offshore? Yeah, there's no winner. Yeah, they're both gonna be there. And if you have an offshore account, you're gonna go offshore. There's benefits to it and from like taxes to potentially even like lower cost, like lower trading costs or whatnot. But then you're still gonna need the regulated exchanges because not everyone can go offshore, especially like the regular user. They're not gonna be able to set up an offshore account.
00:27:15.882 - 00:27:38.390, Speaker B: And then there's still a lot of funds in the US that because of their policy or who they are, what they're doing, they need to stay onshore. Right. So that volume will still be there. And then when you enter Defi, what's going to happen for the traffic guys is that they're going to need like some sort of like permission defi structure. So that's why, I mean, you have example maple, right?
00:27:38.930 - 00:27:39.906, Speaker A: Shout out maple.
00:27:39.978 - 00:28:05.808, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I said another example, like metamask last year. They came up with institutional metamask. Right. So you're gonna need like, this little bridge for the US accounts to be able to go directly on Defi because I'm sure this how their regulation is gonna go towards. Right. Like, you can go defi, that's fine, but the authorities need to know how the money is moving and who is owning what.
00:28:05.808 - 00:28:23.150, Speaker B: And if you're sending some funds to whatever address, who owns that address, right. So that's at least for the fully onshore one. So, yeah, I think we'll find it's just gonna be a complex system, like what we have right now, but there's gonna be room for everything.
00:28:23.690 - 00:28:46.360, Speaker A: That's a perfect answer. It's super interesting just to kind of see, I mean, how it has been unfolding and kind of like, extrapolating that out with the permission pools. I think Aave is doing something similar as well with the permission borrow and lending pools. But, yeah, it's interesting just how it's all kind of molding together.
00:28:46.480 - 00:28:59.016, Speaker B: Right. In the end, what they want to know is if someone is gonna default, who do they have to blame for that? Who can I go after? So that's the only, only thing, I think that's where everything comes down to.
00:28:59.128 - 00:29:23.856, Speaker A: That makes sense, I guess, like, one thing that surprised me during the, or even like, or more so 2021 was like, nfts and how popular they became. Is there anything that surprised you over the, like, last couple years that you're like, I totally did not have this on my bingo card, but holy shit.
00:29:23.968 - 00:30:05.610, Speaker B: I think we all have this feeling of when I remember, like, things started picking up in 2019, 2020, I think it was like, fall 2020. I even have friends that they were just doing, like, really dumb things, like a unicorn and then just like, making an NFT and whatnot and, like, to the moon or stuff like that. And then 2020 fall, there was, like, this little big hype and we all kind of thought that was it, right? And then 2021, I think every quarter, we all had, again, the same feeling. Like there was like, a little bit of, like, NfT hype or like, crazy nft hype, and then everyone was just like, okay, that's it. And then it kept on going. And still today it keeps on going.
00:30:05.690 - 00:30:06.042, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:06.106 - 00:30:55.080, Speaker B: So I do have the feeling of, like, when is this gonna stop? I'm all for. I'm not particularly familiar with the whole ecosystem, but I do think there's a really good use case for NFT that we're still kind of exploring right now. And then the only thing that really surprises me about it is just using nfts as collateral for loans. That's the only thing that, I mean, that it's great, right? Like, I'm happy that there are new products and different ways of using nfts, but it's a really subjective, I don't know, like acid or call it, but not super liquid. If suddenly. Yeah, but if suddenly someone comes and says, oh, this NFT is like worthless right now, and then the floor price drops to. Because that's how, that's how they, they look at.
00:30:55.080 - 00:31:06.700, Speaker B: They collateralize the right, they detect like what's the floor, floor prize and from there they structure everything. But, yeah, what if someone comes and then the floor price just like completely.
00:31:07.680 - 00:31:28.256, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. I haven't talked to too many teams trying to solve that problem. I know there are quite a few, but I've kind of had the same questions as you. I'm confident over the long term they'll like figure out like a sustainable way to make it happen. Yeah, but it is super interesting. And like, then if you have like rare NFT, like, how do you categorize that?
00:31:28.368 - 00:32:02.418, Speaker B: I would, yeah, I would be like 99% sure that this use case would not be used. Like using an NFC's collateral for like if you want to borrow to do whatever that borrowing is not going to be used for trading traditional level. I'm pretty sure that's not. Yeah, maybe for other things. Yes, like more low risk strategies. But I don't see some of the big boys like borrowing and hey, here's this NFT as collateral. I don't think the risk teams would allow it.
00:32:02.594 - 00:32:12.042, Speaker A: No, it is super interesting. What do you think with the Defi versus c five or just nfts?
00:32:12.226 - 00:32:14.230, Speaker B: What's your NFT intake?
00:32:15.810 - 00:32:59.840, Speaker A: I don't know. I think what has been interesting to me is during 2020 we saw all the cool things that happened with composability and these applications stacking on top of each other and how they can interact with each other from those interactions make something more meaningful than the sum of the parts. That was super interesting to watch. That was why I was still at Tesla and I was like, this is nuts. Like, we can't beat these people because they're just building apps that plug into each other and they all make each other better. But I was pretty positive at that point everybody else was going to be like, holy shit, defi. But that was not the case.
00:32:59.840 - 00:33:19.160, Speaker A: It wasn't really until I was trying to show all my friends defi and I was like, hey, this is super cool. Try this stuff. Try uniswap. Try comp and aave. And none of them really cared. And I was like, I was confused by that. I thought everybody thought it would be much cooler because I did.
00:33:19.160 - 00:34:05.454, Speaker A: But nfts to me were, I mean, definitely have taken the world by storm. And I don't think very many people predicted that. I think it's been cool to watch these communities form and people identify with a certain group and then help each other for whatever their stated goal is. That's been super neat. I'm curious how, like, I mean, I like to use like, the analogy of like, or like with Tesla. Like, they came out with the roadster, then the model S and X, and then they have the model three. I think, like, NFTs will probably go through, like a similar, like, series of iterations.
00:34:05.542 - 00:34:06.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so, too.
00:34:06.638 - 00:34:26.150, Speaker A: Like, the first batch is like profile pictures, and then the next batch is like, more utility, and then I don't know what the third batch is going to be, but, like, or more so just like, that continual progression will kind of make interesting NFTs more interesting as a whole.
00:34:26.190 - 00:34:53.254, Speaker B: Yeah, more like exploring right now with the uses for the future. Yeah. Question for you. So your last few months at Tesla, was there kind of like an exodus? Like, did anyone else leave to explore more crypto that, you know, was what was the talk? Like? Were people talking a lot about crypto while you were there? Or was that people are excited about it? Or was it more like, what is this scam? Like, someone just got an ear drop?
00:34:53.342 - 00:35:33.026, Speaker A: Much more. The latter. There was only one other person that was deep into the crypto, and him and I had different viewpoints on where it was going to go. He was very interested in bitcoin, and he is an extremely smart dude. He focused more on the money aspect and I focus more on the technology aspect. I was naturally much more interested in Ethereum at the time, and he was very much interested in bitcoin. He ultimately left and joined square and works on cash app from the bitcoin side.
00:35:33.026 - 00:35:58.124, Speaker A: And I just went the full time investing. But besides him and I did not find anybody else that was particularly interested in cryptocurrency at that point in time. Right after they implemented where you could pay for a car with bitcoin, but.
00:35:58.252 - 00:35:59.636, Speaker B: You were not there for that anymore.
00:35:59.708 - 00:36:37.854, Speaker A: No. So I don't know how much I can talk about Tesla. I would just say, I mean, Elon has a lot of influence, and if Elon wants something done, it will get done. And so on the other side of that, I think in some part we didn't discuss crypto outside of, like, our immediate teams is just because everybody's always running around doing something, like, there is no time to be like, so what do you think about x, y, and z? Because everybody's, like, has 10 billion things to do, and you have to do those 10 billion things. And adding another thing just, like, is too much.
00:36:37.902 - 00:36:40.198, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just not time efficient.
00:36:40.294 - 00:37:15.824, Speaker A: Exactly. And so, yeah, we really didn't discuss it about too much. I tried to, like, crypto pill some people, but it was very, very inefficient. I found a lot of my crypto endeavors, until recently, very unfruitful, and I wanted to get more people in, but I think for the vast majority of people, like, seeing is believing, and now seeing is believing. I'm interested, though, like, if we actually do go into a bear market, how that will affect people's perceptions again.
00:37:15.872 - 00:37:16.792, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, I did.
00:37:16.816 - 00:37:17.620, Speaker A: Not that we.
00:37:19.200 - 00:37:51.980, Speaker B: It's kind of a weird market right now, but I don't think we're gonna go fully into a bear market the way we saw in 2018. I think it's gonna be a bit more of, like, I don't know, I'm thinking, like, range trading a little bit. There are gonna be a lot of. From altus that are just gonna be just gonna die at this point because, like, they haven't really produced anything to a lot of this. Yeah. Other algorithms that just. They're gonna disappear.
00:37:51.980 - 00:38:07.516, Speaker B: Right. But I feel that a lot of the. A lot of the flow is gonna go more into l one's and probably, like, the top, like, 510 that are actually building. And. And we're gonna stay like this for a little bit. But I don't think it's gonna be.
00:38:07.628 - 00:38:12.892, Speaker A: A dramatic, you know, those 70, 80, 90% drawdowns. I have PTSD from those.
00:38:12.996 - 00:38:38.072, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we are. Ok, so from all time high 2021, which was between April and May, if nobody sold out their position and they just, like, hold whatever they had, everyone should be down between 70 and 80% still up from 2020. Right, but between 70 and 80% down from all time high.
00:38:38.136 - 00:38:38.728, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:38.864 - 00:38:57.112, Speaker B: So, yeah, so there goes your drop. And then I think right now, it's just also on a macro environment, things are. Things are wild right now, so they are. So it's. Yeah, I think everyone is just, like, hedging at this point. And that's it.
00:38:57.216 - 00:39:11.536, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's super interesting. I mean, living through that 2017 bear market, I don't know if it's a positive or a negative at this point because all that baggage of those drawdowns, they stay with you.
00:39:11.688 - 00:39:54.276, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean volume wise, I, what happens some ledger x for instance, when there was a bit more like especially within options, if there's not that much volatility, there's when balls are low. A lot of traders do not trade as much because it's not as quote unquote fun, but so you see like less volume. But even now the volumes have remained pretty much the same. So there hasn't been a drop in volume. And if anything on the OTC side, at least from Ledger prime, we've seen a lot more volume on the OTC side. So, which that's also given that just people don't want to crash the market or they don't want to impact the market with their large trades throughout directly on the exchange.
00:39:54.276 - 00:40:11.368, Speaker B: So that's the benefit of using OTC. But yeah, so we are nothing. Maybe people are learning more about how to generate smaller yield and consistent yield instead of just going for the 20 x 30 x trade. Right. But yeah, volume wise has been pretty healthy.
00:40:11.464 - 00:40:28.828, Speaker A: That's awesome. Good to know that. Or hopefully that we will not major crash again. But yeah, even on like the yield farming side, that has been interesting as well. Does Ledger prime provide like yield farming strategies or any.
00:40:28.884 - 00:40:39.828, Speaker B: We do have a yield or a Defi team. Yield farming team? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's part, so that's more of, we provide yield farming through our treasury management.
00:40:39.924 - 00:40:40.348, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:40:40.404 - 00:41:06.684, Speaker B: And we do treasury manage management for either token projects, corporations, like more traditional corporations, high net printed oils, etc. And, and then the yield farming is also just like part of the hedge fund strategy. So, yeah, so we do, we have a dedicated team and we allocate like between ten and 20% of the capital depending on how the market is going or what opportunities we're seeing then.
00:41:06.772 - 00:41:43.222, Speaker A: Okay, nice. Yeah, it's, I think, I mean, all the different experiments that have been going on in like the Defi farming space have been like super interesting to watch. I've kind of been looking at them from afar, but I haven't been paying as close to attention of them recently. But it is, the whole space is interesting. I think the hard part is now there's so much going on compared to even a year or two years ago that you kind of really have to pick your specialty and your focus.
00:41:43.366 - 00:42:08.652, Speaker B: You do. Anyone that's trying to run yield farming strategies by themselves and while they have another full time job, it's just, yeah, and that's something, I guess that's like one of the selling points, right. Where it's like, listen, you can do it, but if you delegate it to someone else, you likely do a lot more yield just because there's so much going on and it's really hard to keep track of everything, the new things coming out. Yeah, it's just not easy, I guess.
00:42:08.716 - 00:42:27.096, Speaker A: Like one of the things that I'm impressed by is your depth of knowledge in the financial markets and also like the technical side. So how did you, I guess, become so familiar with, like, just like the financial stuff? Was that through undergrad or just like something that you were personally interested in?
00:42:27.128 - 00:43:01.726, Speaker B: It's actually funny, I was speaking about it with one of our quants yesterday, how I personally, I wish I had spent a bit more time in traditional finance. I was there for like a bit more than a year, and then I did study finance undergrad and computer science grad school. So the mix of both. Yeah, give me a good financial understanding. So one thing that I will complain that business schools should do, or at least like finance tracks, they should teach about financial infrastructure. That's something that I have never seen taught anywhere. And it gives you a better idea of how things are working instead of just saying, explaining you what an option is.
00:43:01.726 - 00:43:27.058, Speaker B: I can read that online. Right. But there's a lot of things that there's, there's no, there's nothing in the books or there's nothing you learn by just being in the industry or just doing your own research somehow. But, yeah, so my learning was basically through that. It's been more whatever I learned while in Amsterdam, I did have a really good team and a really good manager. Shout out to him. He's still like one of my heroes today.
00:43:27.058 - 00:43:55.372, Speaker B: I still speak with him here and there. And he taught me a lot from the traditional side. And then at Ledger X, I was working every day with one of, we had one of our active investors, he was working with us every day. And he also taught me basically a lot of what he knew. And he spent like 2 hours a day with me on calls during. We were all working from home, completely in lockdown. So yeah, I learned a lot from him there as well.
00:43:55.372 - 00:44:32.848, Speaker B: And then part of my like, at Ledgerx, we had, we were also teaching retail customers what options were and futures. And then we, with the VP of, with Alexa, the VP of sales and operations, we built the whole support desk and we also had like office hours week to week. So thanks to also all the retail customers that they would send sometimes questions that I was like, okay, you have to grab a piece of paper and draw out what you're trying to do here because. Yeah, either I'm not understanding what you're saying, or it's not. Well, you know, like, strategy is not well driven or. Yeah. So a bit with, like, everything, I guess, life and experience.
00:44:32.848 - 00:44:33.320, Speaker B: Right?
00:44:33.400 - 00:44:33.840, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:33.920 - 00:44:48.456, Speaker B: And I got to understand for the first time what people meant about experience, because there's things that you can read and you can learn, but there's other skills that it just comes through, like, just years doing the same thing for sure.
00:44:48.528 - 00:45:05.046, Speaker A: No, I think I, yeah, that's one of the biggest things that I've learned as well is there's, you really just have to put your reps in, no matter, like, what skill you're trying to learn. The more reps that you can do, the better you'll just get at the thing over time.
00:45:05.238 - 00:45:39.614, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And then I feel I'm honored. I'm blessed to have, like, great people like you. A lot of the technical stuff that I've learned from you this past month has been amazing. So everyone pitched in because this guy is very smart. But, yeah, so just from speaking with people, like, one of the things I like about conferences is that you always learn, and sometimes you read things on Twitter that make sense or you read from a medium, blog, mirror, whatever. And then it's not until you listen to that speaker on a conference or you talk to someone that says something that then you click and it's like, oh, my God, that makes sense.
00:45:39.614 - 00:45:49.552, Speaker B: Now I understand why this is happening for sure. So, and that's recently, a lot of people are asking me or saying, hey, I want to get into web3. Where do I learn?
00:45:49.696 - 00:46:37.344, Speaker A: This is where I was going to try to segue to, I think now, I mean, throughout 2020 and 2021 and even to the start of 2022, people are super interested. They want your knowledge. They want to learn about the computer science stuff. They want to just learn about the industry as a whole and how to break in. And I think your background is super interesting from the fact that you didn't traditionally or you didn't go into crypto straight out of your master's program, but you met some interesting people and then kind of learned along the way. So how would you, or what skills or recommendations would you kind of recommend to people that are looking to learn more about the industry or trying to get into crypto?
00:46:37.442 - 00:46:48.452, Speaker B: I would. First thing, I would, and that's because it's what, it didn't work for me. Get engaged with whatever community of crypto in buying nfts. I was gonna say, just go to.
00:46:48.476 - 00:46:50.356, Speaker A: Meetups, but probably better.
00:46:50.428 - 00:47:27.000, Speaker B: But you can buy nfts if you feel like buying nfts. Don't get my advice on that, because all my nfts have gone to zero. But they're pretty, but they're just no value. But, but I would just engage with the local community and go to meetups and conferences and then also maybe find a couple people in the space that might have a bit of time to talk to you. Not on a weekly basis, but whenever. Do your own research, of course. And I guess the first thing, first and foremost is, what are you interested in? You're really into the tech side.
00:47:27.000 - 00:47:47.278, Speaker B: For me, it's more the finance side and just, you know, just. Yeah. The idea of, like, democratizing or giving more resources to people. Right. Others might be the artistic side of crypto and the property rights and whatnot. Right. Other might be more infrastructure.
00:47:47.334 - 00:47:58.934, Speaker A: So, slight tangent. I think this is one of the beautiful things about the industry as a whole, is that there's so many different aspects that people approach it from. That kind of all leads it back into this new technology.
00:47:59.062 - 00:47:59.622, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:47:59.686 - 00:48:11.366, Speaker A: And I find that fascinating, that everybody has their own different niche, but, like, I kind of describe it as the black hole that, like, swallows everything. But it's. Yeah, it's super interesting how people get into the industry.
00:48:11.438 - 00:48:27.788, Speaker B: Yeah. If you think when the Internet started, if someone wanted to get into the Internet again, get into crypto and just thinking in kind of the same words, you would note I, maybe people were saying the same things like, hey, I want to learn about the Internet. Where can I start?
00:48:27.884 - 00:48:28.560, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:29.140 - 00:48:36.140, Speaker B: What, what? You put it really good a few days ago where you're saying that blockchains are just like, communication networks.
00:48:36.180 - 00:48:36.492, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:36.556 - 00:48:37.676, Speaker B: Same thing with the Internet. Right?
00:48:37.708 - 00:48:38.140, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:48:38.220 - 00:48:45.828, Speaker B: So, I mean, basically same thing, but, yeah. So what is it? Or at least I would, I'd be more, the question would be more like, what are you interested in?
00:48:45.884 - 00:48:46.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:46.212 - 00:49:02.166, Speaker B: And then see how, who's building what in crypto? That's very similar to that. And then just get in touch with them. Read about that, and then. Yeah. See what are the blockchains that are building more applications or more things related to that topic and go from there?
00:49:02.278 - 00:49:27.312, Speaker A: No, I think that's great advice. Yeah, no, it's. It's a fascinating space. There's so many moving parts and so many things to learn. So I like that. But I guess maybe we're almost wrapping up on, like, 50 minutes. Is there? And maybe, like, if you want to, we could talk about like mental health.
00:49:27.312 - 00:49:29.576, Speaker A: Just briefly, for, like, maybe ten minutes. Yes.
00:49:29.608 - 00:49:30.540, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:49:31.040 - 00:50:09.760, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think you and I have both worked in companies or put ourselves in positions that demand a lot from us, some at different points in your career, some jobs are more demanding or the places that you put yourself in kind of have different cultures. I personally did, I would say, not the best at always handling that. What are some of the things that you learned, looking back on it now that either helped or didn't help? And how would you kind of approach it now?
00:50:10.180 - 00:50:26.028, Speaker B: My issue is. My issue was, like, not setting the right boundaries. And now I've learned the hard way, but, and I think that's the same with everyone. Sometimes we're, like, scared of setting boundaries because we think that would limit us towards our growth.
00:50:26.084 - 00:50:26.540, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:26.660 - 00:50:42.574, Speaker B: If I say what I think here, what I want here, then maybe they won't. Right? Like, it's always like, what if. What if that ends up. You end up doing a lot more than. Not that. Not a lot more than you can, but a lot. You can do it, but you're gonna end up just, like, crashing yourself.
00:50:42.662 - 00:50:43.190, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:43.310 - 00:51:05.152, Speaker B: So, yeah, my issue was just being scared and of, like, setting these boundaries, and then you end up just. At some point, you just. And there was nobody but, like, my fault. Right. I should have been able to set up my boundaries, and that's what I wish I did. I was just careful, like, like, many reasons. Just.
00:51:05.152 - 00:51:12.648, Speaker B: What if I don't. What if I don't get the job? If I don't agree to this? Like, I push already knob on the offer or whatever. Yeah, this looks good.
00:51:12.704 - 00:51:12.984, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:13.032 - 00:51:25.176, Speaker B: But it's. Maybe it's not right. Or you just. You're just, like, scared of, like, looking around and so that would be, like, maybe one thing. Just ask for what you think you like you're worth, and then you can take it from there for sure.
00:51:25.368 - 00:51:43.456, Speaker A: I think a lot of people do not ask for things. I mean, myself included. And I think the people that I have admired and that do things, they're able to ask for the things, and then even if they don't get it, then they're still able to learn from that.
00:51:43.488 - 00:51:53.280, Speaker B: And I would go as far as saying you should always be able to speak up your mind, and everything, while communicated, is fair game.
00:51:53.360 - 00:51:54.136, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
00:51:54.208 - 00:52:12.876, Speaker B: And speak up your mind, say what you think, and have an open conversation with the other part, if the other part does not react well to it, or. And in the end, like, if they don't react well, it's not your fault. It's always like a reaction, like we are. It's. It's. Yeah. So it's just like, it's dependent on how they react.
00:52:12.876 - 00:52:15.756, Speaker B: But the point here is maybe it's not the right place for you.
00:52:15.828 - 00:52:16.500, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:52:16.540 - 00:52:49.954, Speaker B: Like, you want to be somewhere where you are happy, where both sides appreciate each other, and where you agree to on where your direction is going, what you're doing. So that be the first thing. Just like, don't be scared of, like, of speaking up and saying what you think you deserve or you think you're worth. And the first thing is, like, know how much you're worth, which is also a really hard thing to. To discover. It's taking me a while to know what is the actual value I can bring in crypto. And then also, because a lot of things, I just had to go through a learning process, and now this learning process is not complete.
00:52:49.954 - 00:53:16.524, Speaker B: But at least with what I know now, I know what I can bring. And then I also know what else I need to learn or what else I want to learn at least. And then besides that, also take time for yourself sometimes. And this happens. It happened to me in the past where a very exciting account or whatever has asked me to schedule a call, and it's me maybe 11:00 p.m. or, like 05:00 a.m. for me, or.
00:53:16.524 - 00:53:46.150, Speaker B: And I'm like, yes, it's fine, but it's really not fine because it. Sometimes it happens, and that's okay. It's crypto 24/7 but, but, like, try, if you stay in your own schedule, you can actually be a lot more productive, productive than otherwise. And I've reached a point where, like, I just said yes to everything and I was sleeping maybe three to 4 hours a day, and, and that, like, that was not three to 4 hours a day, a couple times a week or two times a week. It's not that in the weekend I was able to slip in.
00:53:46.230 - 00:53:46.606, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:46.678 - 00:54:07.282, Speaker B: Because, I mean, I. I had shifts and stuff, and then I had to wake up early as well. So I consistently slept between three and 4 hours every single day for a whole year. And again, that's nobody but my fault, because I could have just managed my time in a different way, or I could have said no to other things. Right. So also, I want to say yes to everything because it's part of growth. I need to say yes to everything.
00:54:07.282 - 00:54:44.586, Speaker B: And, yeah. And I never really took a step back and was. And thought about, is this good for me or not? And is this. If I feel we're gonna go a little long, maybe, but saying yes to everything, how long can I do this for? And how would that impact not only my current role, but what I want to do later, for sure? Because even when I left previous company, it took me, it took me a long time to fail 100% again. I started at Ledger prime that the first month I was still not, my head was not in the game.
00:54:44.698 - 00:54:45.390, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:46.010 - 00:55:05.046, Speaker B: Was really not. It was, it was really hard. And I felt also really bad because the first month, you really want to show that they hire you for the right reasons. And then first month, I was just like, wow. Yeah. I had to fight through myself, and then I also, it almost made me feel like I was not good for the role.
00:55:05.158 - 00:55:05.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:05.670 - 00:55:22.810, Speaker B: And then suddenly there was, this weekend, there was a conference and, and that kind of, like, it was a very chill conference, so met a lot of, like, great people and that, I don't know, there was, like, the 360 there, and now I feel good. But it took me, yeah, two to three months to feel good about it.
00:55:23.960 - 00:55:58.200, Speaker A: I admire that you are able to come through on the other side only after a couple months. I think one of the hardest parts, after kind of getting beat down, in a sense, whether physically or emotionally, is just kind of getting back up. So that's awesome. So I think the three things are, ask for what you want, set boundaries. Remind me of the third one.
00:56:00.060 - 00:56:10.012, Speaker B: Take time for yourself and take time for yourself. It's okay if you say no sometimes, for sure. Don't have fomo. That's gonna happen again, like, the week after, so.
00:56:10.116 - 00:56:11.348, Speaker A: Yeah, very true.
00:56:11.444 - 00:56:11.932, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:12.036 - 00:56:19.692, Speaker A: All right, well, we're closing in on an hour. I really appreciate you being my first guest and learning with me on all this. Thank you very much.
00:56:19.716 - 00:56:22.880, Speaker B: I'm really honored. So thank you, you for having me. This is awesome.
00:56:22.960 - 00:56:23.800, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Laura.
