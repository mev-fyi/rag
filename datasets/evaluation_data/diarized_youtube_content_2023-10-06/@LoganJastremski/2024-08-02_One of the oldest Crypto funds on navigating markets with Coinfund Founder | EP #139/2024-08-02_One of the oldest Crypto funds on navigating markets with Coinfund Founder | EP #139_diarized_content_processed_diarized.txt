00:00:00.560 - 00:00:20.118, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't. I don't think that I can, like, we've definitely had, like, an up market, but I don't think I can call that a bull market. And now we're. We're back down. I think we just haven't started the largest crypto bull market of all time. So I bought my first bitcoin on Coinbase. It was November 2013.
00:00:20.118 - 00:00:44.660, Speaker A: I think I paid 400, maybe $12 or something. Like, look it up on my Coinbase history. You know, for my first bitcoin, people, like, $400 and what they don't realize is that between 2015 and 2016, bitcoin was between, like, two and $400. For two years. It was this, like, abysmal bear market where, like, nothing was going on. There were no investable founders. I think this was, like, November 2016.
00:00:44.660 - 00:01:16.492, Speaker A: It was an ICO that sold out in about. I want to say something like five minutes or something like just single digit minutes and raised over. I believe it was like something like $10 million worth of capital, which at the time seemed just like, how can you even form capital with such haste? Right? When 2018 came, there was a sharp sell off. The bull market was over. We went into a two year. We called it bare winter. Right.
00:01:16.492 - 00:01:48.352, Speaker A: It was like one of. Up until that point, it was one of the most abysmal, depressing periods. I remember in the early innings of 2018, sitting with some of our co found folks and just being like, man, maybe the SEC is just gonna, like, shut this whole thing down and we'll just have to go get jobs, right? And, like, sure. I mean, like, how much detail do you want? Like, I. So I'm just as you like, I'm the. I'm the founder and CEO of Coin Fund. Coin fund was sort of my idea.
00:01:48.352 - 00:02:22.340, Speaker A: The logo of Coin fund is something that I designed, right. So I can really claim kind of that spiritual founding of the brand. But basically, like, my story is, I was an am a technologist, and I always had an interest in finance as well. So, you know, early days, I used to work in the high frequency trading industry. Then I worked at hedge funds. I got kind of sick of Wall street, went and ran a proper technology team at Amazon. I was a technical product manager and engineer.
00:02:22.340 - 00:03:00.770, Speaker A: And then I left Amazon to be kind of like an entrepreneur, but didn't found that company. I came in as a partner and CTO to sort of fintech alternative data firm, where we would reconstruct the business models of private technology companies and then sell that data to people who were doing m and a and hedge funds that were anticipating that Uber would go public soon. And really, it was during that period that I learned about blockchain. So I had a friend in Brooklyn in April of 2011 who was like, hey, check it out. They made digital money.
00:03:01.430 - 00:03:02.558, Speaker B: That's super early.
00:03:02.694 - 00:03:20.222, Speaker A: It was very early. I totally didn't even get it at the time. And I sort of, like, downloaded the bitcoin client. I tried it on my laptop. My laptop, like, overheated. I was like, what is this crap? I think he sent me, like, half a bitcoin. Like, I think bitcoin was around $30 or something.
00:03:20.222 - 00:03:44.882, Speaker A: Like, right before I dipped back down to, like, two. And what really got me into the space, well, into bitcoin subsequently, was that I used to work at a hedge fund where someone on the quant team did a one pager about how bitcoin actually works. And that was, like, the light bulb moment for me. I was like, wait a minute. This is, like, really interesting tech.
00:03:44.946 - 00:03:45.590, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:46.330 - 00:04:21.012, Speaker A: And then I read Vitalik's white paper, essentially. I, like, like, I told this story a lot on podcasts, but I, like, I read the. I read the vital white paper. I put it down, I looked at the wall for 30 minutes, and I was like, yep. Like, digital assets are going to be a new asset class. So coin fund is the manifestation of my, essentially bet that digital assets would be a new asset class, that blockchains are not just about currency, but they're really about decentralization technology. And, I mean, there's a lot more details that could fill in there.
00:04:21.012 - 00:04:21.980, Speaker A: But let me pause there.
00:04:22.100 - 00:04:55.410, Speaker B: No, I guess, like, what gave you a. The, I guess, conviction to start a fund, especially in 2015 when Coin Fund founded? Because at that time prior, you had bitcoin. And then there were some things going around with colored coins, trying to make bitcoin a little bit more programmable. And I think just, it was like, 2014, the white paper forum came out and was at that. That was like, all right, let's. Let's see what we can do here.
00:04:55.710 - 00:05:28.042, Speaker A: Well, I think for me, it was a combination of factors. So one is like, I've always had an entrepreneurial itch, but how do you become an entrepreneur? I never went to school to become an entrepreneur. So it was always trying to think about, hey, if I were to start a business, what business would it be? I had a few early run startup experiments. Me and my friend Nik Yakovnko was actually a founder in crypto today. We had, like, an early 2013 era startup where we were doing machine learning on brain data. So we're trying to think about, like, hey, can we read, like, people's sentiment?
00:05:28.106 - 00:05:29.978, Speaker B: Doing some neuralink early neuralink.
00:05:30.034 - 00:05:42.906, Speaker A: Totally. Totally. I just found the video of that product, like, the other day. It was wild. And then. So that was, like, one prong, and then, like, the other prong is. I was always, like, very interested in investing.
00:05:42.906 - 00:06:21.928, Speaker A: Like, I always knew kind of from school and from the fact that, like, my parents worked on Wall street for many years. Like, like, when I make some money, I want to invest it. And to me, stocks seemed, like, really freaking boring. I tried to, back in 2005, 2006, I tried to go into peer to peer lending because that seemed like a more new crazy thing. And so when I saw crypto, this was, like, the perfect combination of technology and finance on the intersection of which I have always worked. And my interests kind of were always there. And I was like, wow, here's a new asset class.
00:06:21.928 - 00:06:42.730, Speaker A: Here's something that could be really, really big and impactful. It is like, tech all the way down, which I love, and it is going to transform finance and look at all these other applications that it could potentially have. So that's what really got me to say. I really want to work in crypto full time. And I realized that vision April of 2016.
00:06:43.550 - 00:07:14.848, Speaker B: I'm super curious because now there's relatively ish, like, a standard playbook for getting either a crypto hedge fund or a venture fund off the ground. But in 2015, I'm sure that was much more difficult even going out and raising a venture fund for going out, talking with limited partners, saying, hey, there's this new thing, blockchain technology. There's this thing called Ethereum, there's smart contracts. How was that process?
00:07:14.984 - 00:07:46.020, Speaker A: So absolutely wild, right? So first of all, Coin fund's official track record begins on July 1, 2015. So that was actually before I went fully full time on it. It was a bit of a side project to begin with. In fact, at Coinfund, we have this early email that I have to one of my, he was the first non Brookman investor in the project, my friend Yashara. And it's like, from, I don't know, like June of 2015 or something. And it's like, hey, Yashir, I'm working on a side project. Like, here's the, here's the white paper or whatever.
00:07:46.020 - 00:08:15.542, Speaker A: Anyway, so there was no market for digital asset investing from an lp perspective at all, because digital assets were not an asset class. That was not a consensus view. Right. I. There were definitely a few players. There were, like, individual high net worth individuals, crypto people investing and stuff. There was a few, like, to Panteras credit, they had one of the earliest, like, bitcoin funds.
00:08:15.542 - 00:08:56.184, Speaker A: I think that was in 2013. The cyber fund guys who I mentioned right before we started taping, who are still around a cyber fund, you know, they were there in 2013, you know, so there's like, a few. A few folks. But by and large, it was, you're selling a dream to an empty audience who's not, like, listening to you, is not even there, and you're sort of screaming and saying like, hey, this might be, like, really interesting, really big, but there's no money anywhere, right? So, like, it was a huge, huge hurdle. And it took some maturation and price movements of the space for people to finally, like, start sharpening their pencils, maybe.
00:08:56.232 - 00:09:29.788, Speaker B: Talk about that, because I'm super interested in people that have just gone through kind of the cycles, the booms, the bus. I feel like there's always euphoria. Generally, at some point, at least historically, these periods of very drawn out bear markets, players collapse, people get over leveraged. It's very painful, maybe talking about 2017 in the IcO era being front and center to that.
00:09:29.894 - 00:09:50.520, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So, you know when people ask me, like, okay, like, when did you buy your first bitcoin? Right? So I would say. So I said, I tell them. So I bought my first bitcoin on Coinbase. It was November 2013. It was on that up slope to 1200. I think I paid 400, maybe $12 or something.
00:09:50.520 - 00:10:16.000, Speaker A: Like, look it up in my Coinbase history, you know, for my first bitcoin, people like dollar 400. And what they don't realize is that between 2015 and 2016, bitcoin was between like two and $400 for two years. It was this, like, abysmal bear market where, like, nothing was going on. There were no investable founders. There were a bunch of bitcoin companies that had made the bet and got vc investment to the effect that.
00:10:17.700 - 00:10:17.964, Speaker B: You.
00:10:17.972 - 00:10:45.340, Speaker A: Know, bitcoin would be a new form of money. And they completely have gone out, had gone out of business at that point. So it seemed like a total failure. And, you know, in. In that bear market of 2015, there was sort of this inkling that Ethereum would launch. In fact, you know, as I said, coin fund was July 1, 2015. Ethereum launched the next to last day of that month, which was July 30.
00:10:45.340 - 00:10:48.296, Speaker A: So we have this spiritual kind of connection.
00:10:48.368 - 00:10:49.512, Speaker B: Same birthday month.
00:10:49.656 - 00:11:46.230, Speaker A: That's right. And also we mined some of the first blocks on Ethereum frontier as coin fund and we inscribe them and we can find them and dig them up. So it was just sort of a wild market to even be making that bet because there was no inkling that anything would happen. And a lot of people, a lot of newspaper headlines were being written to the effect that, like, okay, look, bitcoin is now totally dead. Around toward the end of 2016, we started to see an ICO phenomenon. And one of the things that launched was the first ICO on Ethereum, which was Auger prediction market, which are now cool again in 2024. And then the one that really stands out in memory was Digixdao because this was, I think this was November 2016.
00:11:46.230 - 00:12:27.870, Speaker A: It was an ICO that sold out in about, I want to say something like five minutes or something like just single digit minutes and raised over, I believe it was like something like $10 million worth of capital, which at the time seemed just like, how can you even form capital with such haste? And that's when it started to, that's when people started to pay attention. That's when the prices started moving up. And by the time we were in early innings of 2017, we were like in a bull market mode. And there's a lot of interest conglomerating toward the space from founders.
00:12:28.810 - 00:13:23.780, Speaker B: And it was kind of a, it got even crazier throughout the year. I kind of came in personally towards the latter half of the year and got into, I think, ether for the first time around like 700, and quickly learned I was not the genius that I thought I was probably six months later. But I guess what were some of the learning lessons? There was a lot of excitement. The new ways of capital formation ultimately spurred a lot of interest not only from investors, but for builders to be able to experiment with these different things. But we got ultimately some cool things funded from 2017. But 2018, 2019 was really, I'd say, kind of like the inklings or seeds for what was then kind of like Defi summer.
00:13:24.640 - 00:13:28.060, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. So what's your question?
00:13:29.000 - 00:13:47.580, Speaker B: I guess, like, so you had like 2016, 2017 the run up? Yes, I guess. How was coin fund? What were some of the learning lessons through that first really big boom period that you carried throughout 20 18, 20, 19, 20 17.
00:13:47.660 - 00:14:34.624, Speaker A: Was this sharp focusing of attention on the space, sharp increase in pricing, sharp increase in probably regulatory scrutiny to some extent too, because the SEC was already looking at thing, you know, projects like the Dow, which had come the previous year. So they were already like doing some work on like, what's going on in this industry and space. I think Logan, the reality was that a lot of people raised money for projects that truthfully couldn't really come to market. And that's because the kind of the infrastructure of blockchain just was not mature. It was just not there. Like, that was one thing. Another thing is, like every founder, they had to find a way of putting a token into their offering so they could do an ICO, could raise money, etcetera.
00:14:34.624 - 00:15:17.656, Speaker A: And of course, that created a market of what we, in retrospect, call utility tokens, which are tokens that you have to pay to a network to get sort of the service of that network. Now, that turned out to be just like a terrible, terrible idea because it creates a friction for consumers and normal users. Like, you have to have a wallet, you have to have ether, you have to have this token, you have to pay this token for. Like, there's just so much friction there that just on that property alone, like, thinking critically with hindsight, like, we probably couldn't have launched most of those products. And then there was also, like, ridiculous stuff going on. There was champagne on the blockchain, there was mom coin, there was dental coin, there was this, there was that dental.
00:15:17.688 - 00:15:18.936, Speaker B: Coin had a pretty good market cap.
00:15:18.968 - 00:16:27.604, Speaker A: For a while, right? And so when 2018 came, there was a sharp sell off. The bull market was over. We went into a two year, we called it bare winter, right? It was like one of, up until that point, it was one of the most abysmal, depressing periods I remember in the early innings of 2018, sitting with some of our cofound folks and just being like, man, maybe the SEC is just going to like, shut this whole thing down and we'll just have to go get jobs, right? And like, that did not happen, thankfully. And actually, in that period, we raised our first sort of, quote unquote, real LP fund. That was in March, that was our second seed fund, and we made some of our most important investments. Like, we just by being around and sort of being like, I know this looks really bad, and this is like, not a good environment and it keeps going lower. But if we sort of double down on our conviction that longer term this will be something and we'll come back and we'll work then.
00:16:27.604 - 00:17:16.420, Speaker A: Arguably, some of the most important investments that we made in that period were. That's when it happened, right? And then when 2020 came around and we got through the coronavirus crash and things started looking up, some of those investments just made coin fund what it is today. One example is block daemon. This is a deal I think we did in 2018 at $15 million valuation. It's a multibillion dollar company now. It's probably on the list of companies that could ipo since Coinbase IPO'd and just incredible kind of growth there from that period and many, many, many other projects that are still relevant or their areas are still relevant today.
00:17:17.560 - 00:17:54.228, Speaker B: We could probably talk for hours on just like the history of coin fund and learned. I definitely would find it super interesting. But maybe to fast forward today, I think one thing that you are uniquely focused on as an engineer and also as an investor is just this over section or cross section of AI and crypto. You guys have been writing about this for numerous years now. Can you kind of share more of your thoughts just about the intersections of crypto and AI?
00:17:54.324 - 00:18:32.786, Speaker A: Absolutely. It's now more. More kind of hip to say decentralized AI, which I'm fine with. We definitely started that journey probably at the end of 2020 with our investment at Worldcoin, and then continued that journey with a very speculative early investment in March of 22 into a company called Jensen AI, which is working on kind of compute aggregation and decentralized training. And Rishin Sharma, one of our analysts, and I, in September of 22, we published kind of our thesis on open neural networks. We said, look, there is a, there's a tech stack here. There's a few things that you want to do in this tech stack.
00:18:32.786 - 00:19:42.506, Speaker A: You want to aggregate compute, you want to train models, and you want to do inference on those models, and you want to productize them. And all of that can be done with web3 primitives. Now, why do you want to do it that way? Well, because the pipeline that creates AI products like this tech stack, plus, you know, the talent, plus the distribution that we have today is all owned by just a few big tech companies, most of which are located on the west coast of the United States. And I think pretty much everyone in web3 uniformly agrees that that is not a great setup for democracy, for language, for culture, for different cultures who might require, you know, an LLM that, you know, is just closer to, like, where they are and emotionally and vocationally and so on. And so, like, everyone kind of is seeing right now a proliferation of AI models. Just like in the beginning, we, you know, some people have said, oh, there's only going to be one blockchain, and yet we've seen this enormous proliferation of blockchains. Same thing is happening in AI.
00:19:42.506 - 00:20:31.288, Speaker A: And so to me, like, what is decentralized aihdeme? It is applying web3 primitives, like decentralized networks for computation, token incentives, storage networks, things like this, very deep tech focused machinery to democratize that pipeline, to make it easy for people to compute their own model inference, making it easy to train a model. Right now on this topic, I actually want to spend, like, 30 seconds on this, because even right now, as we sit here in end of July of 2024, it is consensus that decentralized training is just not something that's interesting. Why would you want to do that?
00:20:31.304 - 00:20:32.384, Speaker B: Saw your tweet on this recently.
00:20:32.472 - 00:21:17.152, Speaker A: It's so slow and it's never going to work. And all the big tech companies have, you know, one already, and they have all the compute and et cetera. And, like, I could not disagree with this more. Right. So I think, like, we've recently made some investments with founders who are, you know, exceptionally qualified. They're at PhDs in AI. And what they're, what they're showing is that there's very clearly, like, research that exists today that shows, like, look, you can actually take a step back, you can re architect strategies for fitting models in a decentralization context, and you can actually truly start to build networks that are bigger, more open, and in fact, more monetizable for various reasons than the way that we do it now.
00:21:17.152 - 00:21:26.060, Speaker A: Even with our open models from, like, Facebook and stuff, we could do it better and we could do it more aligned with web3 openness.
00:21:27.360 - 00:22:36.630, Speaker B: So maybe to dive deeper into that and break apart kind of those core three things, the training of the model. Historically, those GPU's been co located in a data center. Then you have the inference once the model is built, getting a request from the model, and then the data itself for the model. I guess I definitely see the case for data and inference inference in my mind, being kind of like edge computing. We're in Miami. We have blockchain infrastructure that ultimately is able to co locate in Miami. And you run inference requests, I guess perhaps being closer to the metal on the training side, is it just like you're speaking with the entrepreneurs that get you excited about either research breakthroughs, or is it just that over time, as these models get more specialized, they will work in, like, a decentralized context?
00:22:37.690 - 00:23:29.522, Speaker A: I think it's a conglomeration thing. So, first of all, yes, it's speaking with entrepreneurs who are kind of, like, interested in this topic and them basically demonstrating that, look, here are some promising research directions that already exist that we just need to sort of implement to do this. Now, you might ask, okay, why do you want to do this? Well, first of all, compute is said to be very scarce. But I think that is like a point in time type of measurement. And the reality is that it's very scarce. And the production of compute is currently at like, all time highs. Companies are building, like, nuclear power plants to power, you know, GPU data centers.
00:23:29.522 - 00:24:33.462, Speaker A: I think the reality of compute is that it will flood the market, actually be very cheap in a few years. Right? So that's like one thing to say if you actually want to build out, build the big tech companies in training a large model, what you need to do is you need to aggregate enough compute to be competitive with them, and they can buy a lot of compute. And yet we know from bitcoin, which is the largest supercomputer in the world, that we can in fact, aggregate, using crypto and blockchain technologies, we can aggregate a lot of compute. Let me paint you a picture of the end state of decentralized training. I think we will have really large networks that will have aggregated compute. That compute will be heterogeneous commodity hardware, not necessarily high end hardware, which, by the way, if you just solve that problem of like being able to massive to train models on commodity hardware, that already does so much to spread AI further around the world, and that in itself is valuable.
00:24:33.526 - 00:24:38.782, Speaker B: So these are like the m one, m two, m three on MacBook pros, and like three thousand eighty s, forty eighties.
00:24:38.886 - 00:25:37.926, Speaker A: But really, like any, any hardware, I've talked to teams that say, hey, you could have a cluster where you could have a mid range GPU, an array of mid range GPU's here, an array of high end GPU's, an array of low end GPU's. And all of these will help train your model as long as the architecture is amenable to that. And so really large networks that can actually aggregate more compute than, let's say, Google, where you can form capital for training in a crypto native way, which we've seen, like starting with the ICO boom of 2017, which just discussed, crypto. This is one of the bread and butters of crypto. No one aggregates capital better than crypto. And finally, there's some people who argue that training is not that valuable because most people are just hitting the inference. Well, the interesting thing about these networks is that they are going to be training some of the largest models in the world.
00:25:37.926 - 00:26:20.182, Speaker A: Those models are going to be sharded across the people who train them. And if they're sharded across the people who train them, those weights might actually be proprietary to the trainers. And in order to perform inference on such a network, you actually have to go back to the people who trained it. And so it actually has commercial viability in the sense of being closed weight. But these networks are open in a different sense. Like, they're closed in the sense of weights, but they're open in the sense of setup. Like, when we talk about open models from llama three from meta, yeah, we know the weights, but we have no idea what data it's trained on.
00:26:20.182 - 00:26:55.320, Speaker A: We have no idea what hardware it's trained on. We have no idea the training setup. Now, if you open source that aspect of it, then that actually creates the ability of people to come in and fork your setup and create a marginally better model through the same network. So I think once we demonstrate, which will probably be in the next two years, once we demonstrate that a large network like this can train a competitive model to something like a GPT four or Llama 3.1, it's going to be a very different conversation of what is consensus around decentralized training.
00:26:56.500 - 00:27:18.558, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, maybe wrapping it back to the product side. I mean, all of this is ultimately to facilitate kind of AI that anybody has access to that can be customized towards whatever liking that you want. And it's not a woke model or a conservative model, whatever flavor you want it or don't want it.
00:27:18.614 - 00:27:40.770, Speaker A: Or even more fundamentally, the way I think about it is if I'm a scientist and I want to try an experiment with a large scale LLM, I don't have to work at Facebook or Google or OpenAI to do that experiment. I can go present my idea and its merits. I can form capital and I could do the training on these open networks.
00:27:41.350 - 00:28:07.960, Speaker B: It would be fascinating. I mean, it's very interesting just how ultimately these will intersect over time. You mentioned, though, Coinfund was an early investor in Jensen, but at that time it was much more speculative. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about that story? Because I do think Jensen is probably one of the leading teams right now in decentralized neural network training.
00:28:08.340 - 00:28:52.924, Speaker A: Well, I think there's a bit of a cultural dividend, like everywhere between web two and web3. There's a cultural divide between kind of traditional AI people that are very associated with web two and web3. Entrepreneurs who are like, venturing into AI and building products there. And, you know, they have slightly different values. Right? Like the web3 people have self, you know, they like self sovereign data, they like open source. The traditional AI people, they defer a lot more to institutions. They're like, where did you get your AI PhD, what professor did you work with? What company lab did you sort of mature under? Was it Google? And this kind of stuff matters.
00:28:52.924 - 00:29:59.088, Speaker A: And I agree, the people who truly, deeply understand AI the best are the ones who have this kind of more institutional, traditional training. But if web3 is ever going to become thing, and by extension, if AI, web3 is going to become a thing, we need to bridge that gap. So if you look at how we've invested in the space, it's definitely like investing in people who are like on the other side of the river and we're trying to get them closer to web3 primitives, or they, they have already recognized that themselves. So, you know, world coin, Sam Altman's project, Jensen AI, you have, you know, Harry and Ben, who are just like, have incredible pedigree in the AI world. Bedan at Bagel Network, we have a bunch of other examples we can draw. But it is when those AI people, when they realize the value of these web3 primitives, that's, I think, when the most interesting synergies occur, and that's when we can start getting closer together to the traditional AI world.
00:29:59.224 - 00:30:39.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been seeing this across, like the decentralized physical infrastructure networks as well. It's more to your point, these industry experts in their certain domain starting to realize they can potentially leverage kind of the coordination of a blockchain to enhance their product than like crypto native saying, hey, I'm going to go become an expert in telecom or whatever it may be. To me, it's super exciting because you have these people that have really thought deeply about this project, and they just are either stumbling or slowly realizing that crypto actually can turbocharge this.
00:30:40.090 - 00:31:38.466, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I have my AI PhD founder who's working on decentralized training. And the way he tells the story is he's like, you know, I go to one of my former colleagues from the big tech company who has an AI and PhD like me, and I start to talk to them about, like, decentralized training, and their first reaction is like, why are we talking about this is, this is stupid. Like, then I show them, you know, a couple of research papers that are, you know, replacing backpropagation with other algorithms that are more parallel. And they're like, oh, okay, well, they go from like, this is silly to like, yeah, I guess that could work, right? And then I show them a few other papers and like, show them how you could put it all together. And then they get really excited and want to quit big tech and join you know, my startup, so that's, that's, that's the process that is just starting now that I think will be happening at scale, like in a few years.
00:31:38.578 - 00:31:53.038, Speaker B: So I guess for founders that would be interested in talking with Coinfund, are you like more excited about training or inference or data? Or is it just like training eventually will happen on blockchains and it's just kind of a thing to call?
00:31:53.214 - 00:32:24.404, Speaker A: I'm excited about all of those things, but for different reasons. And I'm also like, eyes wide open about their timeframes. Right. So, for example, decentralized inference is something that is very understandable and accessible to a lot of teams. And so you see, like, I would say 100 projects right in that area, and everyone's going after a similar strategy of inference. But if you look in decentralized training, you can count the number of companies on one hand in decentralized training.
00:32:24.532 - 00:32:41.076, Speaker B: How much of this is also just a part of being an investor that has played the game for a while and also learning to go where people are not? Or is it more just like this is possible? I realize that it's possible before others, and I'm going to make bets there.
00:32:41.148 - 00:34:10.386, Speaker A: Well, if I'm going to sell coin fund through this lens, it would just be like we take a deep interest in the bottom up functionality of the technology that we're studying. It's not so much about predicting the future, it's more about being able to turn a deeper understanding or insight into better foresight, into better guessing or making an educated guess about how this might play out. And so a lot of, like, on the decentralized training thing, like my, my experience is just that people have this, if you know the term, like availability cascade. But anyway, I just mean that, like, people tend to parrot that trope a lot. They're like, ah, decentralized training is slow, it's not worth looking at. But anyone who's actually gone like 14 levels deep into decentralized training will be like, you can do this if you expend enough effort. Now the question is like, should you, will you, can you find that funding for that? Who do you, who's going to fund that? Who's going to believe you? Like, Silicon Valley is pushing back, you know? And so there's a certain, like, contrarian view to that, right? But the whole thing about investing is if you're contrarian and right, you win.
00:34:10.386 - 00:34:15.522, Speaker A: So that's kind of how I think about it. I want to be contrarian and right about the centralized training.
00:34:15.666 - 00:35:06.590, Speaker B: There we go. Maybe shifting a little bit. I think it's been interesting as a new fund manager kind of coming into the space probably late 2023, you kind of had a little bit of the hangover subside from FTX, from Luna in 2023. Valuations were kind of, in my perspective, a little bit more in line. And then as liquid markets start to get more exciting during, as things pick back up, so do the venture markets generally. Founders have high expectations as well. What have you found just today in terms of the venture markets and how they are?
00:35:07.090 - 00:35:10.910, Speaker A: Like the venture markets for companies or venture markets for funds?
00:35:11.570 - 00:35:25.606, Speaker B: Venture markets for funds. As an investor, how have you found the current market? Because now there's also calls from, there's too many venture funds. We should have more liquid funds to be buying tokens.
00:35:25.698 - 00:36:35.410, Speaker A: Yep. So 2022 was a devastating year for crypto fund managers in general, and especially like emerging managers. And of course, that's because of all the debacles we saw that year. Luna Blockfi, FTX, you know, was the camel that broke the whatever, right? And so 2023 was actually a year where a lot of people, like, who were gonna go into fund management, I think they saw opportunity in the space. Like, I went to East Denver at the beginning of 2023, and I remember bumping into a lot of emerging early stage managers who were looking at pre seed and seed companies in crypto. And overall, that's a great signal, right? Like, if you have a lot of early stage people, they're sort of betting on the fact that this is going to grow a lot over the course of the next few years. But what those managers, I think, found was a market where professional LP's are just not writing checks in the aftermath of 2022 in crypto and also the macro environment.
00:36:35.410 - 00:37:21.876, Speaker A: And so I think 23 was a very, very tough year to raise money just across the board, especially for emerging managers. But also, like, if you look at some of the fundraising that have happened in larger funds, like, you know, people would raise funds at 30% size to what they did before. You know, it was like reflecting the fact that the market has cooled off. I think there's a few managers toward the end of 23 and early 24, you, Logan being one of them, and I know a few others who actually were finally able to raise money, and congratulations on that. But I know how hard it was, I guess.
00:37:21.948 - 00:37:49.720, Speaker B: Yeah, super painful in terms of, like, when you guys start to see valuations rise. I think this kind of happened in 2021 towards the latter half. I'm sure it happened in 2017. Do you guys just work with founders. Are you going in different areas that people don't look? How are you guys viewing that from a coin fund perspective?
00:37:50.740 - 00:38:58.902, Speaker A: We have a lot of debates about, we're generally quite valuation disciplined, both relative to traditional markets for tech companies and for crypto markets. But we often have the debate of, like, how big does something have to purport to be for us to accept, like a higher valuation? I would say, like in our last seed fund, which we launched in ECC Paris 2023, that fund has done well on valuation discipline. So it's been mostly seed. It's been mostly kind of seed valuations in the range of like 15 to, you know, maybe like 30, $35 million. We have led or co led every deal. I think there's about eight deals in there. We've been winning kind of bigger ownership because we're positioning as lead or we're positioning as someone who is really helpful to teams.
00:38:58.902 - 00:39:41.474, Speaker A: And we do work very, very actively with our portfolio companies. We can talk about that. And so it's been quite valuation disciplined. On the other hand, there's definitely certain areas, and these areas are mostly in sort of deep tech and infra in this year, in 2024, that have seen just like incredible valuation. I mean, we've seen AI web, three companies kind of go out at hundreds of million type of valuations in their rounds. We've seen high throughput blockchains do well, we've seen paralyzed EVM projects do well. So there's definitely, like, pockets where things get pretty crazy.
00:39:41.474 - 00:40:18.530, Speaker A: And honestly, like, we sometimes get over that hump if we, like. We did matter labs, for example, at around that was later stage than we would, like, normally do well. We got comfortable with that kind of valuation for it just because we think the opportunity for ZK ropes is so big. So we do get there on certain things, but for the most part, we want to see, we're company builders. We want to be there early, we want to help them, and we want to collect a return associated with taking on that kind of journey.
00:40:19.000 - 00:40:40.928, Speaker B: And part of that being helpful. Coin fund's been around for a really long time. You guys have a great reputation in the space as being helpful to founders. How do you cultivate those relationships with engineers, not even after investment, but even prior to investment, making sure you're staying on top with the smartest people in the industry?
00:40:41.064 - 00:41:44.820, Speaker A: Well, in the beginning of the pod, you asked me how did I get into this space? My earliest inclination back in 2015 was like, hey, should I become a crypto founder? I'm a tech guy, I'm an engineer. I would be a good fit for a CEO or a CTO of a startup. Where I got to was like, no, I should do a fund because it's so early and this technology has to mature so much that if I start one startup now, it's almost guaranteed that it's going to be obsoleted, like later. But if I start a fund, then I can be alongside maybe 100 founders who are trying to solve those kinds of problems. And so, you know, like when I personally work with founders, it's usually along the lines of technology. It's like going deeper, like understanding functionally what their networks are doing. It's also like founders are very focused on what they're building and what their kind of competitors are building and what their companies that are in synergy with them are building.
00:41:44.820 - 00:42:47.078, Speaker A: But they're not focused on the technology that they're not thinking about. That's going to come through here like a train and derail everything. As an investor, you get this higher level view where you can advise people on that, you can keep an eye out for your portfolio companies. And then just to say a little bit about coin fund more broadly, philosophically, that early desire to be next to company builders, to CEO's, has translated into a post investment discipline at Coin fund. Now, what does that mean? It means that our journey with a company really begins at the moment that they enter the portfolio, right? Of course, there's this huge process of finding them, doing due diligence, taking them to IC, winning the deal, etcetera. But the journey really starts when they go in. And our view is we want to give companies this five to ten year horizon to achieve success.
00:42:47.078 - 00:43:43.970, Speaker A: Doesn't matter if you're a centralized company, decentralized network, token, whatever it is. And so how do we work with them? They have access to in coin fund, to a 30 person firm that will work with them on every vertical of problem that they have. So it's like crypto native problems. How do I design a token, how do I, you know, structure a foundation in the Cayman Islands, whatever it is, to very standard and dry startup problems. How do I hire, how do I have a kind of an intracompany process that's robust and make, makes my organization strong? It could be like, hey, can I talk to Senator Loomis in Washington DC about policy? Right? Like all that kind of, every vertical of problem. There's someone at coin fund who can help you with that. Jenna Pilgrim is our head of platform.
00:43:43.970 - 00:43:45.334, Speaker A: She's very visible.
00:43:45.382 - 00:43:46.134, Speaker B: Cause she's great.
00:43:46.222 - 00:44:30.722, Speaker A: Yep. You see, you know her. Cause she's out in the field working with her companies all the time. Jules Mosler is our head of comms and marketing who helps our companies with announcements. Margaret Gabriel, our head of people helps companies hire, build robust processes. All the managing partners at Coin fund, you know, work with the deals that they deals with the deal and so on and so forth and so like, I mean, the best way, like you don't have to take my word for it. Like, the beauty of this is that all you have to do is go to talk to a company in our portfolio and just ask them, like, how have you worked with Coinfund and like what have they done for you? And we tend to get great reviews on that and that is, there's no substitute for that kind of marketing.
00:44:30.866 - 00:45:02.562, Speaker B: Yeah, founder feedback and personal endorsements, so to speak, are invaluable. Maybe on the flip side, what are things that either you or the fund I always like, I feel like I'm my biggest critic and there's many things that I can do to personally improve. Is there anything that you feel like you or like Coinfund want to continue to iterate on or get better, either personally or at the fund level?
00:45:02.746 - 00:45:35.710, Speaker A: Always. Always. Always. So like, you know, one thing we're constantly thinking about is our investment process and how that process works. You know, I think our process over the last two years, excuse me, has really gelled. We designed it with the help of David Pakman, who is an extremely experienced vc. When someone joins the coin fund investment team, they are doing that first and foremost because investing is an apprenticeship vocation.
00:45:35.710 - 00:46:23.502, Speaker A: You do it by doing it and you become good at it by being next to people who are good at it. So like, the number one thing is constantly, like learning how to be a better and better and better investor by doing that and being next to good people, and then secondarily being a great investor in this particular frontier, technology. So that's something we're always improving. The post investment process, we're constantly improving. Like Jenner recently put together kind of a vendor platform where our portfolio companies can go get things like third party vendors, AWS credits, Google Cloud, this kind of thing. But it's all packaged for them in awesome SaaS that they could use on.
00:46:23.526 - 00:46:59.736, Speaker B: The being better investor. I totally agree. It's just something that you have to do. What are some lessons that you've kind of just learned from running coin fund? Because I think you have tremendous wisdom from being one of the first fund managers in the entire space, I'm sure lots of ups and downs. What are some big takeaways? Has it been just continuously underwriting? It has been going deeper. And what are large markets? Is it more? Hey, there's a special gut feeling with this founder. They're brilliant.
00:46:59.736 - 00:47:01.620, Speaker B: Any unique callouts?
00:47:02.580 - 00:47:35.856, Speaker A: Like, I think I would, you know, I would sell coin fund in a few different areas. Like, I would say so. First of all, we're probably like more technical on average, than the average, like, crypto fund person. And that has just helped to be early, to be early and, right. We are probably more institutional. So there's something to be said for being able to convert professional LP's. That means you have to have a certain level of process and discipline, and that usually means running a larger.org,
00:47:35.856 - 00:48:12.666, Speaker A: and running a larger.org carries with it some kind of innate authority as well, whether or not it's deserved just by virtue of being bigger. It also means there's more capital because of that professional LP process. And so we can write bigger checks. We could lead more. You know, I think, like, in terms of lessons about the subject matter itself is, first of all, crypto is obviously very, very cyclical. And success in crypto, to me, means taking a very long term view with high conviction on what we're all doing here.
00:48:12.666 - 00:49:11.800, Speaker A: And if you can't do that, then what are we doing here? So, like, part of the longevity of coin fund is due to the fact that, like, betting on the long term and just weathering a few very difficult periods, frankly, of which this particular period is one of them. Right. We've been in a two year kind of depressing bear market that's still waiting to resolve, probably around election time and so on. But it shows when you talk to founders, people are exhausted, people are, some people have dropped off and so on. So I think that, like, being able to, like, emotionally navigate the cycles is very important. I think one thing we've done well is we've selected companies that we've sort of due diligence from the ground up, rather than looking for external signal. Just, just being original in terms of your due diligence, I think, is a alpha generator, because some of those companies have grown into just tremendous, tremendous projects.
00:49:11.800 - 00:49:53.540, Speaker A: And it was not, obviously, you know, in the beginning. And the fact that we were participants there probably helped them get to where they are today. So, like, we don't do a lot of pre seeds. We do a few, but there's a few pre seeds that I'm, like, super excited about because I'm like, I know, I can add a lot of value in helping to build this company, and that's ultimately what I'm here to do. And then I think we learned a lot of lessons around how to structure fund products, too. Yeah. Like, early on, we had a kind of a hybrid fund, which some crypto managers still do today.
00:49:53.540 - 00:50:31.146, Speaker A: But our second fund was kind of a hedge fund with venture side pockets. And what we learned, of course, it was in a certain era, it was in, like, the 2018 era. And what we learned at that time was, like, very difficult to raise money for such a thing, because when you would go to, you know, a hedge fund fund of funds, they'd be like, you're too much like a venture fund. And, like, when you go to venture fund to funds, they're like, you're too much like a hedge fund. And so what I think we did well was we split out our strategies a little bit into separate funds that, on their own, look a little bit more standard. And so we have a seed fund program. We have a venture fund program.
00:50:31.146 - 00:50:36.576, Speaker A: We have a liquid fund program, and those are just a lot more coherent products.
00:50:36.768 - 00:51:01.620, Speaker B: So to that point, what do you think of the current rumblings in the market? That there are too many venture funds historically, because you could do either infrastructure deals or get very early tokens, and then these things would come out at multibillion ftvs, and there's not enough liquid funds to buy these tokens.
00:51:02.320 - 00:51:18.400, Speaker A: I mean, our first fund was just like, we're like, let's just design the most futuristic looking crypto investment vehicle. It was an experiment, and it was essentially like a liquid fund, right? So, and then our second fund was like a hybrid.
00:51:18.440 - 00:51:18.568, Speaker B: Right?
00:51:18.584 - 00:51:58.132, Speaker A: So we were like, and we have a liquid fund today. So I'm not like, I'm nothing. I'm not without experience in how those funds work and what they kind of do. But what do we actually see in the market? Right? We see in traditional tech, we see this long time to liquidity, ten years to IPO, something like that, eight to ten years. And by the way, that IPO window at that time was also, like, extending dramatically. Then we go into, like, ICO era, and suddenly time to liquidity is like, zero. You send them the money, and then, like, a week later, you have.
00:51:58.132 - 00:52:47.480, Speaker A: You're trading on a Dex or something or an exchange at that time. And so at that moment, it seemed a lot more feasible to do a liquid fund and seem more sensible to the liquid fund. What people quickly found out was like, that's not actually, like, a good set of incentives for humans. Like, there's probably like a sweet spot in between the ten years and the zero, wherever projects will get built better. And so, like the, the 90, the middle 90% of deals that crypto funds do today, what do they look like? They look like an equity deal. This is also sometimes important, because an equity deal, you can get governance in a company. And after FTX in November of 22, that became a lot more important to investors and LP's just to have a little bit more oversight.
00:52:47.480 - 00:53:44.390, Speaker A: And then together with that equity, you get some kind of promise of token. So I don't actually see right now the market reverting to just zero time to liquidity, and everything is liquid assets. On the contrary, I see it converging onto something which is a compromise. Now the question is, what's the best kind of fund to take advantage of that? I would argue it's still a venture fund. Well, because you can create more DPI in a crypto fund than you can create in any sort of traditional venture format, on average. So you're using the disruptive qualities of this liquid asset class, but in a venture format where you have ten years to achieve success, I still think that's a really good format. But we also run a liquid fund.
00:53:44.430 - 00:53:52.174, Speaker B: Too, so we'll see both strategies, but they're still alpha. And venture funds maybe.
00:53:52.302 - 00:53:54.134, Speaker A: I don't think venture funds are going away.
00:53:54.222 - 00:54:40.300, Speaker B: Okay, I like that. So we're a little bit over halfway of 2024. How are you feeling about the rest of the year? And coming into 2025, we kind of have a little bit more of a potentially promising regulatory regime, which would be great just to understand the rules and not make them super opaque. But outside of that, we also kind of have infrastructure, in my opinion, kind of maturing to the point where you can actually build applications at scale and move up the stack. How are you feeling now? Having played the game for a long time, seeing these ups and downs, how are you feeling just today?
00:54:41.360 - 00:55:28.164, Speaker A: So, again, I'm feeling like we're in a very long bear market. So I'm a little bit tired. I'm not so tired that I'm going to call it, but I do want to see us sort of resolve this. I think that we only have a few months left. I think the election is going to be a huge point of resolution about where crypto is going, at least in the US, and that will be an indicator for other markets as well. Out of all the things that happened, I like the tech side that you mentioned the most. Like we are more positioned than ever before to create, essentially, web, two equivalent apps.
00:55:28.164 - 00:55:42.710, Speaker A: And my mental model on this, Logan, is like, do you know how many iOS apps hit the new iOS apps hit the market every month? Do you have a sense?
00:55:42.830 - 00:55:45.366, Speaker B: I'm sure tens of thousands? Hundreds.
00:55:45.478 - 00:56:20.430, Speaker A: Tens of thousands? It's about 40 or 39,000. Last I checked, the Google Play Store has about 50,000. So you're talking like, approximately 100,000 new applications hit, you know, people's phones around the world every month. And out of that 100,000, there's, like, a few that are good, that are growing, that generate revenue, that become bigger, that are useful, etcetera. How many crypto apps are we producing per month? Is it ten? Is it 20?
00:56:21.250 - 00:56:23.346, Speaker B: It's definitely not in the thousands.
00:56:23.538 - 00:56:44.018, Speaker A: It's definitely not 100,000. So, like, where I want the space to be, obviously, over time, is I want us to be producing tens or hundreds of thousands of decentralized applications every month, of which a few will be creating, like, major impact. So I don't think. I think we're just at the start of that journey.
00:56:44.154 - 00:56:53.490, Speaker B: And you still think even prior or up until this point in 2024, we've still kind of been in a bear market?
00:56:55.270 - 00:57:08.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think that I can, like, we've definitely had, like, an up market, but I don't think I can call that a bull market. And now we're. We're back down. I think we just haven't started the largest crypto bull market of all time.
00:57:08.910 - 00:57:35.096, Speaker B: I like that. I like that. I guess, obviously, you're very deep in the weeds in AI and crypto. Are there any other pockets of the market that you have uniquely get you excited? I know applications more broadly, but anything else outside of the crypto AI intersection, totally.
00:57:35.128 - 00:58:01.306, Speaker A: I'm wearing my Sindri hat. Sindri is a portfolio company that's doing basically zero knowledge, circuitous lifecycle management, if you want to put it that way, and improving. I really like the team. I really like what they're doing. Their thesis is, look at this. All of the real world applications of zero knowledge are currently in blockchains. It's like storage proofs.
00:58:01.306 - 00:58:40.156, Speaker A: It's zero knowledge roll ups. It's scalability, it's interoperability. There's so many different ways that you could apply zero knowledge in blockchain, and that's before you even get to, like, the privacy properties of zero knowledge. This is just the verifiability that we're talking about. Mostly, I think, verifiable computation of which, like, zero knowledge proofs are one way of implementing that. I think there's just going to be, like a huge market, even beyond crypto. And I think Sindri is doing a fantastic job sort of capturing that wave and being early there and just building phenomenal products.
00:58:40.156 - 00:59:01.200, Speaker A: So I would say, like, we've seen zero knowledge for many, many years. This is the first investment we've made here. We have a lot of conviction what they're doing. Station. The CEO was actually just on our podcast, which we'll launch shortly. So that's one area. Another area I'm really interested in is, like, General NPC.
00:59:01.200 - 00:59:30.480, Speaker A: Because when I think about, for example, problems like private AI inference, right? This is actually not something that you can solve with ZK. You actually need more sophisticated, different technologies for that. This MPC approach seems like it could be one of those things. I'm doing, like, a lot of work there. Let's see what else. And I mean, I think the other stuff is. Is boring but necessary.
00:59:30.480 - 01:00:37.530, Speaker A: Like, we're in this year right now where think about it, we've had a bitcoin ETF in January signed off by the SEC themselves. We just had our Ethereum ETF. We've had Blackrock partner with securitize, which is kind of could say it's a Miami deal. Here you have Blackrock talking about instant settlement, stock exchange. I don't think that's registered in most people's minds. Blackrock, do you remember what happened when TD Ameritrade or whoever, like, one of those brokers, they dropped their fees to zero? Do you remember what happened was that it was like five years ago or something where like, I remember Robin Hood doing it, right? Well, like, as soon as one person, one enterprise in that comp set, like, drops their fuses here, everyone else is instantly do it. So, like, I don't think people like registering the fact that if, like, Blackrock can make stock trading go on a blockchain and suddenly the fees of that become zero and not like $10 for retail people, everyone on Wall street is going to have to go compete with that.
01:00:37.530 - 01:01:25.990, Speaker A: And so what does that mean for modular blockchains, for Solana, for different kinds of supply side blockchain technologies? Who are they going to be picking? Like, there could be just like a flood of demand side interest just on that, right? But my overarching point is, like, these are all kind of boring. Institutional regulatory acceptance is happening, right? Government acceptance is happening. Donald Trump has declared that he is crypto friendly. That will lead to an environment where it's going to be much more productive to be a crypto founder, to raise money. The rules of the road will be much better defined, and I think ultimately that's going to enable consumer adoption at scale.
01:01:26.570 - 01:01:50.804, Speaker B: So we're not bullish enough on the bullish enough. Maybe another thing that we're not bullish enough on is Miami. Yes. You've been speaking a lot about Miami. Coin fund does phenomenal get togethers in Miami. Hundreds of people show up, talk all things crypto. What gets you excited about the Miami ecosystem?
01:01:50.932 - 01:02:33.368, Speaker A: So I'm like an early adopter of stuff. So when I heard in 2020, 2021 that Miami was sort of fixing to be a crypto city, I was like, I gotta come down here and see for myself. My wife and I ended up moving down here, getting a place here. And to be honest, in May of 21, there weren't a ton of entrepreneurs here. There were kind of crypto curious people. A lot of them were all about trading nfts and tokens and stuff, and it was a little bit of a letdown. But I have to say, over the last three years of being here, there's twelve crypto funds, including coin fund and frictionalists who are down here.
01:02:33.368 - 01:03:14.910, Speaker A: There's a lot of traditional tech vc's down here. There's more and more crypto community. Like we get, you know, to your point, we probably get like 350 sign ups per happy hour that we do sign up in October when we come back, you know, we. We're also starting to see more engineers. Like, the fundamental problem with Miami is that we don't really have a university here that like Stanford or, you know, or something like that. Graduates technology people, they have to be imported. But it feels like more and more engineers are coming down here from New York, from SF, from let M, and I'm starting to see like engineering meetups.
01:03:14.910 - 01:03:35.362, Speaker A: So if you ask me, like on a five to ten year horizon, I'm buying a house here, by the way, so I'm biased. But on a five to ten year horizon, I think that Miami will be a phenomenal city to do tech in. There's going to be a lot of investor activity, founder activity, tech meetups. And it's just like a wonderful environment to work with a team here.
01:03:35.506 - 01:03:59.570, Speaker B: It definitely feels like it's on the upswing, buildings getting built, the streets are clean, you have the sunshine. I think whether you were an investor or an engineer and in the crypto industry, you probably spend too much time on the computer, being able to go outside, get the sunshine, be able to walk. It's really nice.
01:03:59.990 - 01:04:24.958, Speaker A: It's really nice. And look, to your point, like, there's construction everywhere. Apple just got a new office in Coral Gables, which is, like, mind boggling. What's that Wall street firm that's building citadel? Yeah. Sorry. Thank you. Citadel is building a whole building here, which also, by the way, means that a lot of affluent Citadel employees are moving to Miami, like, with their buy.
01:04:24.974 - 01:04:27.150, Speaker B: All the real estate in pine crests and coral gables.
01:04:27.230 - 01:04:46.376, Speaker A: That's right. And taking up space in the schools and stuff. Right. So you can see how there's going to be more and more and more sort of development, like, over time. So, look, if you're a crypto founder, come early, adopt the Miami community. That's my pitch to you. There's all kinds of great stuff going.
01:04:46.408 - 01:05:04.420, Speaker B: On here, and I will echo that sentiment. It's a great place to live. Yeah. As wrapping up anything that we didn't touch upon or any tidbits you want to share or coin, fund life, any wisdom.
01:05:07.080 - 01:05:39.410, Speaker A: Well, I will just say that I've had an incredible journey in crypto. It's been a wild ride. And back when Ethereum launched that July 30, 2015, we were like, oh, well, we just got to wait a little while. And summer of 2016, we'll have decentralized apps going mainstream, and it'll be great. It will be like, we'll be out there. The New York Times will be writing about it. Obviously, that's taken a lot longer.
01:05:39.410 - 01:06:20.896, Speaker A: It's taken ten times longer. But there's a certain reality, I think, to the space where I. People are very, very dedicated to it. There are people who have been there from those times till now building toward this vision, and I just don't see a world where this stops. I think the values of web3 will keep going, and we're about to have some of the biggest adoption events that we've seen. So it's. It's a really, actually a very good time to be a manager and a founder and an investor in this industry.
01:06:20.896 - 01:06:22.912, Speaker A: So I'm just super happy about that.
01:06:23.016 - 01:06:36.064, Speaker B: Awesome. We'll end it on that. Jake, thank you so much. Really appreciate you coming on the podcast. Appreciate all your wisdom and wish you and coinfund the most success. You guys have been doing a great job and great stewards for the industry.
01:06:36.232 - 01:06:37.768, Speaker A: Cheers. Logan, thanks for having us.
01:06:37.824 - 01:06:38.480, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks.
