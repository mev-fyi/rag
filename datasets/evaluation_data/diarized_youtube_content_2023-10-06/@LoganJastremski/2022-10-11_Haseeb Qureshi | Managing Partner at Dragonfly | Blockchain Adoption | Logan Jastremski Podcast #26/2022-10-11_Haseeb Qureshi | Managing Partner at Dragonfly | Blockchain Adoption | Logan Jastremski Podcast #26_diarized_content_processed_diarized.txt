00:00:00.240 - 00:00:18.370, Speaker A: Cool. Awesome. Super excited to have you here. Haseeb, thank you so much. I've read many of your writings. Yeah, thank you. I've read many of your writings, even back to some of the ones that you've written on Balaji's blog, some of your og writings.
00:00:18.370 - 00:00:38.290, Speaker A: Very og, yes. So super excited to have you here and kind of just get your general thoughts on crypto and kind of state of the market. I think, holistically, lots of things have kind of happened since 2017. I know ultimately, Dragonfly started in 2019. Correct?
00:00:38.670 - 00:00:39.582, Speaker B: 2018.
00:00:39.686 - 00:01:10.370, Speaker A: 2018. So that bear market happened, which was brutal, but then ultimately, kind of what emerged from that was usable applications and now kind of transitioning into things that people can actually use. So I kind of wanted to just kind of get your general thoughts on the overview of this 2021 market cycle. How do you think it went? And anything that kind of caught you off or surprised you, and then after that, get into kind of some more of your writings.
00:01:10.830 - 00:01:34.000, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So the 2020 cycle, clearly, the thing that kicked it off was Covid. And the COVID stimulus, of course, when Covid first started, thats when we got black Thursday, when Makerdao ended up imploding. And of course, all crypto dropped 50% in a single day. And I remember it feeling like potentially the end. Oh, my God.
00:01:34.000 - 00:02:02.290, Speaker B: Bitcoin was just. BitMex had totally shut down. There were no circuit breakers on any of the exchanges at that time. And so it seemed like bitcoin was just going to liquidate all the way down to zero. And for a lot of people in the industry, we just saw our life flashing before our eyes. We thought, like, is this over? Is this actually the end? And of course, it turned out not to be. And the COVID stimulus that ensued after lockdowns began ended up becoming a massive buoy to all financial assets.
00:02:02.290 - 00:02:35.040, Speaker B: And crypto was no exception to that. If anything, it was one of the biggest beneficiaries. But it wasn't just that. It wasn't just that, okay? There's a lot of money in the system, and therefore the price of everything goes up. There were also a bunch of secular forces that were pushing crypto forward. So one of those, of course, was the fact that in the post Covid era, everybody was stuck at home. And all of a sudden, crypto, which is this thing that you do while you're at home, just playing around, tinkering with your computer, playing around on the Internet, this was all anybody had.
00:02:35.040 - 00:03:35.400, Speaker B: It's like, look, either you can play video games, you can browse social media, or you can try to build this financial future thing. And for a lot of people, this gave them the room and the appetite to delve in and start consuming these products and also start playing around and contributing to web3. That was the first big moment that a lot of people really had the space to learn about web3. The other side of that, of course, was that Paul Taylor Jones, I think it was in 2020, he was the first mainstream hedge fund manager to endorse bitcoin. And the way he described it was that bitcoin was going to be this monetary inflation hedge. A lot of institutional investors suddenly got on board with the bitcoin story, seeing that, hey, the story behind this fixed supply, unmanipulable currency is very attractive in a world where suddenly the m one money supply has spiked to all time highs. More increase in the m one than we've ever seen in the last 50 years.
00:03:35.400 - 00:04:16.420, Speaker B: That, to me, that's like the one two punch that ended up really changing everything we saw. With that, the advent of Defi. Defi exploded in the summer with the launch of compound and comp token. Then we saw the rise of NFTs first, this is the winter of 2021, 1st, starting with Nifty gateway, then transitioning to Opensea and some of the more open stuff. Then we saw crypto gaming take off in 2021 with axie infinity. And this, things just kind of kept happening and kept building on each other and getting more and more crazy. So it was then, when did the cycle come to a close? I would argue that the moment that the cycle came to an end was the collapse of terra.
00:04:16.420 - 00:04:51.532, Speaker B: And that was, I believe that was may of this year. And Terra, this algorithmic, stable point. I'm sure at this point, everyone in your audience knows about Terra, so I probably don't need to explain, but Terra was, I think, the last chink in the armor of the unbridled optimism that was coming to an end. So obviously, macro, since November, macro has gotten increasingly adverse to crypto, and all risk assets started selling down starting in November, which is when we saw the first inflation print last year. Crypto was no exception to that. It was really trading all of a sudden in lockstep with the Nasdaq. But it was Terra.
00:04:51.532 - 00:05:15.542, Speaker B: I think that internally within crypto, showed people that, hey, the party's over. All the stuff that we thought was in Super bowl, and if you believe three, comma, three, if everyone just holds on hard enough that we can make it come true, Terra was the first very demonstrable thing that proved to us. Nope. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, and it's going to blow up in all your faces.
00:05:15.606 - 00:06:00.816, Speaker A: Yeah, it took me a couple days to even process all that after the terra collapse. It was monumental. It was crazy. So I think that was an excellent summary, maybe to kind of take it one step back real quick. I think one of the interesting things that really kind of caught my attention again was kind of coming out, or when I thought like the bull run was like starting or what kicked it off was like, compound and like, what they did with the liquidity incentives. I just thought once all the food tokens took off, I was like, all right, this is happening. It's going to be a 2017 style moment again.
00:06:00.816 - 00:07:06.230, Speaker A: Really what I thought was so fascinating was the composability of it all. But as that continued to move forward, the user, that was really only brought about by a couple tens of thousands of people, I think less than 100,000. But now, when you looking at dune analytics, really even still today, the most popular dapps are only getting only have a couple million users, definitely less than ten. But even the more popular Defi protocols ever have only had a couple hundred thousand lifetime users. I'm curious, from all of these cool applications being built, it kind of still feels to me like in some sense, we're still in the infrastructure layers, which I think may be a good segue to how you think of your excellent piece on blockchain globalization, cities and countries. Could you touch upon that thesis and then overall user adoption in web3?
00:07:07.930 - 00:07:49.906, Speaker B: Well, okay, let me actually take that in reverse order. Let me start with talking about user adoption, and then I'll transition into the blockchain globalization thesis. So with you pointed out that an absolute number of users on chain protocols, on chain applications have pretty low penetration by any kind of standard web two metric. This is absolutely true. If you look at the concentric circles of crypto, there's something like, I don't know, 300 million people in the world who own crypto. The vast majority, vast, vast, vast majority of those people have never touched anything on chain. Yeah, almost all those people are sitting in binance, or they're sitting in FTX, or they're sitting in Coinbase, and they don't even really know what it means to touch the blockchain.
00:07:49.906 - 00:08:37.420, Speaker B: Right. They just think that, okay, I own bitcoin, what else is there? Now there's a narrower circle of, call it maybe on the order of, let's say, 10 million people who have actually interacted with on chain applications and that means uniswap. That means ax infinity. That means buying nfts on Opensea, this constellation of things. And then, even tighter than that, there's the portion of people who've done complicated things, and that's probably less than a million people who've done complicated things. A long tail defi protocol, definitely less than a million people who touch that stuff. And then the people who are doing, people who know how to read solidity, the people who actually can underwrite the things that they're interacting with and are doing flash loans or whatever, less than 100,000, maybe less than 50,000.
00:08:37.420 - 00:09:22.140, Speaker B: It's important to keep in your mind those concentric circles, what it means when we say that crypto went mainstream. Crypto went mainstream. It absolutely did. In terms of the total number of crypto users, it's still a massive, massive number. And it's also true when you look at, when we looked at the president's working group report just a few weeks ago, their estimate was that 16% of american adults own crypto relative to 2017. That was absolutely crazy number, way higher than what we saw in last cycle. But to most of these people, they don't know even what you're talking about when you say, oh, but what about gas fees? Right? Like, what are you talking about? What is that? Okay, that's one side of it, is that it's important to understand what we mean when we say that there aren't a lot of users.
00:09:22.140 - 00:09:52.140, Speaker B: But the second thing I want to say is that when you look on chain, you look on DeFi. I think if you look at gaming, it's a different story. But if you look at DeFi in particular, saying that, okay, well, DeFi only has, let's say, a few hundred thousand users. Let's say 500,000 on the high end. If Defi has 500,000 users on the high end, the question is not how many users are there in absolute terms. The question is how valuable are those users? And here's what I mean by that. Let's say that I'm a bank, and I tell you that I have 100 customers.
00:09:52.140 - 00:10:47.350, Speaker B: That is not actually enough information for you to know if I am a community bank in Wichita or if I am one of the largest investment banks in the world, because banking is a scale business. If you're banking extremely large clients, then you could be an extremely valuable bank. If you're banking small podunk people, you could have hundreds of thousands of users or clients and still be a fairly small bank. The thing about crypto is that we think about crypto. We often describe crypto in web two terms, which usually means, like, comparing them to social media companies, which are the dominant companies in web two. And social media companies are, they are kind of like the low end of monetization, meaning that you have billions of users and each of those users monetize for a tiny amount of money. Right? So, like, you know, if you're a Facebook user, if you're in the first world, maybe you monetize for like $10 and like, that's your, that's your ArPu.
00:10:47.350 - 00:11:37.310, Speaker B: And if you're from third world, maybe it's like, you know, less than a dollar. That's not how crypto works. The way crypto works is that if you can get 100,000 people, but those 100,000 people are some of the richest people in the world, and they're using your products. Well, your products, they scale massively in terms of the amount of fees that you can extract from very wealthy people. And so the point that I'm making here is that your mental model of how defi, or how crypto monetizes their users, if those users are selected to be very wealthy and to have the majority of the wealth, then it may well be that, look, even if crypto adds another 30 million people on chain, but those 30 million people on chain are much less wealthy than the first million people on chain, that actually, you might in total less than double the overall value of defi.
00:11:37.610 - 00:12:12.732, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I do like the analogy. I think personally, I mean, I got super interested. I used to do product and kind of my background, like, I was super interested in Ethereum and kind of all the things that Ethereum unlocked. And it was more in the past, like an ETH maxi, but now reformed. Ultimately, I think I really just wanted people to use blockchains. And I think from the product perspective, like, the valuation and the kind of, as you mentioned, I think is like a super interesting thing to think about.
00:12:12.732 - 00:12:39.132, Speaker A: But I've just been personally kind of saddened by how few people actually do things on chain versus, like, the amount of holders, which holders is like the great first step. But I really want, like, ultimately it to be so easy and so cheap and so fast that, like, hundreds of millions of people are using these blockchains. And I think that's why I've been a little bit frustrated, like, holistically about, like, web3 still today. But you make a good point on the.
00:12:39.196 - 00:13:00.308, Speaker B: But look, I totally get that. Yeah. I think for valuations, like, the point I'm making is really about valuations. I think it's more true for Defi, it's less true for gaming. Gaming doesn't work that way. Gaming is very lots and lots of users, and you monetize each of them a little bit. And so I think there was just a report recently that Decentraland has less than 100 daily actives or something like that, which is like for a $1.4
00:13:00.308 - 00:13:21.492, Speaker B: billion token, it seems a little optimistic. Yes, but. Okay, let's put that point aside. Maybe this is the reason why it's not the end of the world about whether or not crypto has probably market fit among the people it's going after. I think when it comes to. You make a great point. Look, I want to have a million people using this stuff or not a million, 10 million, 100 million.
00:13:21.492 - 00:13:44.806, Speaker B: I do too. The reality is that there is no blockchain today that can support 100 million people. Not even close, probably. There's no blockchain today that can support 10 million people. So we've got a couple order magnitudes to go before we can get to the level of scalability that we need in order for that to happen. And that actually brings me to the analogy that I give about scaling and about cities. Let me do the setup.
00:13:44.806 - 00:14:04.620, Speaker B: Let me do the setup. So, defacto, especially when this bull market first started in 2020, there was basically only one game in town, and that was Ethereum. Ethereum. Even in 2020, people were complaining about ethereum, as they still do today. Ethereum is slow. It was built a long time ago. It moves very, it improves very slowly.
00:14:04.620 - 00:14:22.300, Speaker B: It's crazy expensive. Nothing ever seems to change. But Ethereum is the most happening place in crypto. If you want to know where the biggest daos are, they're all in Ethereum. If you want to know the biggest Defi protocols, they're all on Ethereum. Where the coolest cats are. They're all on Ethereum, right? All the biggest news, the biggest hacks, it all happens on Ethereum.
00:14:22.300 - 00:14:47.760, Speaker B: It's like New York. New York is a super expensive place. It's like, you know, if you're priced out today, it's like super old. Like it's hard to change the infrastructure, but it's the most happening place, right? It's the most happening city. You want to know where the biggest celebrities, where are the biggest banks, where the biggest companies, most of them are headquartered in New York. But if you're an up and comer and you're like, hey, look, New York's full. It's so expensive.
00:14:47.760 - 00:15:12.710, Speaker B: I want to find somewhere new where I can, where I can start my career. Right. There's a good chance that you'll say, look, New York's not the place for me. So how do you scale New York? How do you move past just New York? So one answer could be like, well, you hope that New York builds their way into something better, which is kind of what we're doing with eth two. Anybody sitting around waiting for e 2.0, which we got the merge, but we still have zero down on the scalability front. It's going to be years until EtH 2.0
00:15:12.710 - 00:15:36.648, Speaker B: actually has scalability improvements. And so that's not really a serious option. So, okay, we can't depend on New York to seal New York. We got to do something else. So option number one is roll ups. So roll ups are these blockchains that kind of extend out from the layer one vertically and allow you to have a mini blockchain built on top of the main blockchain. I sort of analogize those to skyscrapers.
00:15:36.648 - 00:15:59.108, Speaker B: Skyscrapers, they sort of come out of the city. It's like this technology you can invest in that builds vertically. It gives you the features of being in the city, right. But you also have your own kind of separate provenance and your own kind of weird rules because you're inside this building. It is a way to scale a city. And of course, New York has scaled by building up, but there are limitations and there are constraints about building up. Like, one.
00:15:59.108 - 00:16:31.848, Speaker B: You can only build up so far until you have to go build a second skyscraper. And if you build a second skyscraper, if I'm in one skyscraper, you're in a different one. And I want to come hang out with you. It's like, well, I got to go all the way down my skyscraper, go down the street, deal with all the shitty New York traffic, hail a cab, pay the toll fairs, whatever, find my way to your building and then go up to your building. And that sucks. We don't fundamentally escape the constraints of living in New York City just because we live in skyscrapers unless we live in the same one. And that's the problem with rollups, is that roll ups, they give you a constant factor of scaling for each roll up.
00:16:31.848 - 00:16:40.664, Speaker B: And then if there are multiple roll ups and you want to interact with somebody who's on a different roll up, then you got to deal with all the issues of being on Ethereum. You don't fundamentally escape the constraints.
00:16:40.712 - 00:16:41.820, Speaker A: Why is it constant?
00:16:43.160 - 00:17:11.622, Speaker B: It's constant because if you think about it most of these roll ups are running geth. They're running the same virtual machine that Ethereum is running. And so there's a limitation on how fast geth can run. I see, right, so let's say that at max throughput, let's assume that binance smart chain is like Max throughput for Geth. They're just running Geth at the fast it can run, where pieces are flying off the side. It's just like putting in a hyperdrive and putting turbos on. That gives you a maybe like a few hundred transactions per second.
00:17:11.622 - 00:17:29.726, Speaker B: That's what you get when you go all the way to eleven, like the fastest possible way to run Geth. So if you're doing that, because all this serialized, every transaction happens one after another on the same box on the same state. So what's the fastest that that can go? If you're running it at max speed, about 200 gps. But every roll up can do about 200 gps.
00:17:29.838 - 00:17:33.030, Speaker A: The roll up doesn't have to be get, does it? For Eth?
00:17:33.110 - 00:17:56.530, Speaker B: It doesn't have to, no, it doesn't have to. Now, if you want it to be evm compatible, right? If you want to be able to launch Uniswap, if you want to be able to deploy an NFT and create this and do that, like, if you want to make it like Ethereum, then you basically have to run get or get the equivalent. If you want the roll up to just be a place to pay people, well, that's much easier. Right? We have very simplified architectures for just payment roll ups, basically.
00:17:56.650 - 00:18:42.830, Speaker A: This might be a quick side tangent, but what are your thoughts on, like, the Ethereum virtual machine? Because it is single threaded, I think the mark, it's been interesting for me, just talking with a lot of these people and doing research myself, is studying the different virtual machines and also studying the different consensus algorithms and how those have developed and progressed over time. Now it's kind of, I mean, Solana was obviously the first to move to a parallel processing virtual machine, but now I think one of your portfolio companies now, Aptos and SwE and then others have, I think, the capability as well. But those three are like the primary ones focused in my mind. What is your kind of thoughts on the Ethereum virtual machine? And then ultimately these different blockchains moving to parallelization as like the core focus for the virtual machine.
00:18:43.890 - 00:19:21.688, Speaker B: I think it's a big step forward to move to parallelization. I think Solana, very clearly, they were kind of the first major blockchain to do this. They're not the only ones. There were others that are also doing parallelization, but Solana is the only one that really proved it out with scale that they could do this effectively. The problem is that most blockchain loads of are actually not very parallel. And what I mean by that is anytime that you see Solana going down, there's a good chance that what happened was that there was one contract that everyone was trying to hit. And this is the nature of load, is that usually when load spikes, it doesn't spike in a uniform way.
00:19:21.688 - 00:20:08.820, Speaker B: It's not that a bunch of people trying to do a bunch of different things, it's that everyone wants to do one thing. And when everyone wants to do one thing, by the nature of that state, being in one state at a time, you cannot paralyze. So you have to basically devolve down to serial execution. And this is an ultimate constraint. Now, there's a lot of fancy stuff you can do at the margin when you have different contracts that are being hit at different times. But the degenerate case almost always is that things end up pinning one uniswap pool or one NFT drop, or one x, Y or Z. And so that's part of the reason why, although I'm very excited about parallelism, and I think Aptos and Swe are doing a great job in adding more parallelism into the base layer while minimizing the trade offs you're making in order to do that.
00:20:08.820 - 00:20:19.288, Speaker B: At the end of the day, there's only so much that's going to get you because of the fact that these things are very. There's a lot of contention for state in almost every real world blockchain workload.
00:20:19.384 - 00:21:00.690, Speaker A: Definitely. What do you think? I think it's been interesting watching Solana innovate as well, and continuing to iterate with the fees per contract. I'm super fascinated by this because I've talked with other kind of l one founders, and they've said that they're very interested in kind of this aspect as well. Being able to isolate specific hotspots and Atolly's words to serialize just that transaction. And the fees just increase for that. I mean, they still have to be serialized, as you said, but at least those hotspots are isolated and no longer affect other parts of the chains. Curious to get your thoughts on that kind of progression of parallelism.
00:21:01.870 - 00:21:47.142, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I understand the point that is being made there, which is that, okay, at least people who are trying to use some other application, they're not being affected by the hotspot kind of overflowing. In reality, what you care about is the aggregate of all your users, and the aggregate of all your users want to use that one piece of state. So for the aggregate of all your users, most of them are unhappy. Now, the minority person who's playing around with some little dinky thing over here that nobody else wants to play around with, yes, that person's happy. But most of the people who actually want to interact with the blockchain are having a terrible time that day. Look, for a long time, and I gave Solana a lot of shit about this. For a long time, Solana did not have dynamic fees.
00:21:47.142 - 00:22:29.680, Speaker B: And they eventually settled on this per contract dynamic fee system. The reality is that in every blockchain there are shared resources. There are resources that every single transaction is going to end up hitting, even if the state is distinct for that reason. To my mind, although I understand the reason why you would do per account fees, dynamic fees, I think at the end of the day it is probably the wrong way to meter blockchains. I do think the right way to meter blockchains is global fees. Or at least if there's some segregated. If you're sharded, then okay, fine, each shard can have its own set of fees, but there's always some global state that's being hit with every transaction.
00:22:29.680 - 00:22:51.520, Speaker B: Which is part of the reason why in Solana there's only. I believe it's four. They have like four separated modules of compute units. Yeah, basically four cores that are operating. They don't have 16 cores. They don't have 32 cores because although they have graphics cards that can support that many cores easily. And of course cpu's that can support that many cores easily.
00:22:51.520 - 00:23:14.776, Speaker B: The reality is that at a certain point there's this rule called Omdal's law that basically says that the more that you parallelize, the lower the efficacy of the parallelism because the performance of your system falls back to the least parallel part of your system. Correct. Which is a very intuitive way of just saying, look, if you have one choke point, that choke point becomes everything.
00:23:14.848 - 00:23:15.112, Speaker A: Definitely.
00:23:15.136 - 00:23:19.380, Speaker B: And the more you try to scale, the less efficacy it's going to have because you've got the one choke point.
00:23:20.360 - 00:24:04.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm interested to see how they continue to add additional cores over time and even like Aptos and Sui and see how they continue the parallelization. But it kind of making the bullish case, in my opinion, for like sharding and cosmos or like avalanche continuing on in your analogies of cities and countries. How do you kind of see that continuing to play out with these other blockchains? Are they just different cities? Or maybe even more holistically, what do you think the biggest bottleneck is to actually scaling these blockchains to onboard the tens of millions and hundreds of user hundreds of millions of users that we ultimately want to get to.
00:24:04.680 - 00:24:49.898, Speaker B: Right. So the next step in that progression of the analogy I was giving you, it would be, okay, how do you scale New York? You build a new city. And so this is what avalanche is doing. It's what Solana is doing, it's what Polygon is doing, it's what Nier is doing, and of course, what aptos and SWI are doing. And to my mind, okay, so when you're thinking about building a new city, why do you do that? And what's different about building a new city versus the old one? Part of the answer is that, okay, well, there's just more surface area, right? So, like, if the size of the old city was x, now you can build something as two x or three x because you've got two or three cities. The other answer, of course, is that cities tend to be quite different from each other. So if you look at the two biggest cities in the US, we've got New York and then we've got LA, and they are very different cities.
00:24:49.898 - 00:25:10.860, Speaker B: And it's probably no surprise. It's probably like, for some deep reason, that these two cities that are the biggest in the US are very different. They're literally on absolute opposite sides of the country. And culturally, they're about as far from each other as you can get. New York is super aggressive, it's super finance focused. It's got all the status and stuff. And then LA, it's super laid back, it's super sunny.
00:25:10.860 - 00:25:41.870, Speaker B: People are super chill. They're just like, oh, I just want to be on tv, get my ten minutes of fame. That dichotomy, what it does also is it allows people to self select into saying, like, look, I want to live in a big city. I want to provide a bunch of value, but I want something very different than what those other people want. Right. And that allows you generally, what happens very naturally is that cities become very different from each other in order to distinguish different trade offs in the space of all possible cities. And that allows people to self select into the city they really want to be a part of.
00:25:41.870 - 00:26:23.240, Speaker B: And you see that too with l one s Ethereum is very different from Solana. It's very different, and not just in terms of the way the EVM works and parallels them and all this other stuff, it's also just culturally different. Almost everything about it stands in opposition to each other. And that's part of the reason why Ethereum and salon people fight so much on Twitter, is that it's in some sense inevitable that these two things would become more distinct over time. And I think that is the way that blockchain cities are going to evolve. Now, the question that naturally follows is, okay, well, is this going to be the way the blockchain scale, is this going to be the way we bring in millions of users, is that there's a ton of cities. Each city can only hold so many people, and people just kind of select themselves in the cities that they want to live in.
00:26:23.240 - 00:26:44.482, Speaker B: I think this is, to me, the answer is a little bit of everything, a little bit of everything being like one, we get better at building cities, so people just improve their cities over time. So ethereum improves, Solana improves, aptos improves, et cetera. Second would be that we invest in L2, so we skyscraper tech, et cetera. But then third is that we just keep building more cities.
00:26:44.596 - 00:26:44.982, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:45.046 - 00:26:53.414, Speaker B: And we also build the bridges and roads that connect these cities to make it easier for people to move between them and to interact with these cities in a seamless way.
00:26:53.582 - 00:27:06.090, Speaker A: So with the city analogy, do you not think there's going to be kind of like, power law dynamics within the different l one s? Or do you think it's pretty uniform across, like, different l one s?
00:27:06.550 - 00:27:43.128, Speaker B: So the city analogy implies that there's a power law, right? If you look at cities today and you ask, okay, you know, people, people often would ask me like, hey, see, do you think there's going to be one chain to rule them all, or is it going to be like a bunch of chains? And to me it's like, okay, well, the city analogy answers that perfectly, which is, do you think there's going to be one city to rule them all, or do you think there's going to be a lot of cities? Well, just look, right? Like there's not one city to rule them all. There are a lot of cities, but there's a power law, right? New York is really big. LA is like maybe, you know, two thirds as big as New York or about half as big. And then Chicago is like about half as big as that. And then, you know, you've got Houston, which is like half as big as that. And like that. That's what it looks like when you look at cities.
00:27:43.128 - 00:27:52.344, Speaker B: So there are a lot of cities that matter. But there are also. There are multiple cities that matter. But like the top ten cities are the vast majority of where everything lives.
00:27:52.472 - 00:28:22.320, Speaker A: True. Ultimately, maybe like one pushback on like the city analogy. Why is like maybe in your mind, is the city analogy better than like a operating system analogy or communication network standpoint? Is it mostly the ideology standpoint where people have difference of opinions? Or is like earlier technology, like ETH, more BlackBerry ish compared to like newer tech? That's like more iPhone ish?
00:28:23.300 - 00:29:07.900, Speaker B: That's a good question. I'd say there's a more fundamental reason why I think operating system is the wrong analogy for thinking about blockchains. If you're thinking about like Windows or Linux, what constraint is there from the expansion of Windows to basically be installed in every single machine? In principle, there's none. If you think about a network like the Internet or Facebook. The Internet and Facebook were basically extensible to everywhere in the world without loss of scaling effect. Blockchains don't work that way. There is actually no way for a blockchain to expand to 5 billion users because blockchains are physically constrained by the fact that they can only become so large and still maintain consensus and still maintain decentralization.
00:29:07.900 - 00:29:32.180, Speaker B: So there's a scale limitation on a blockchain the same way that there's a scale limitation on cities. You cannot have a city that just takes up an entire country. It just stops becoming a city. It breaks off into multiple cities. And there are generally big dead zones in between cities. That is because of the fact that cities are geographically constrained. They cannot just become infinitely big.
00:29:32.180 - 00:29:39.510, Speaker B: And the same thing is true of blockchains, which is why I think the city analogy produces a lot of the same artifacts that blockchains do.
00:29:39.970 - 00:29:50.190, Speaker A: And the main kind of technology bottleneck, in your opinion, is the execution environment because you cannot continue to paralyze things indefinitely.
00:29:50.810 - 00:30:21.580, Speaker B: It's not just that. It's also that if you make the blockchain arbitrarily large, or require arbitrarily expensive resources, then it can no longer be decentralized. Normal people will no longer be able to validate this blockchain. If you basically make this blockchain. Imagine Solana. Imagine degenerate case of Solana where the only way you can run Solana is with a supercomputer. If that were true, you needed terabytes of memory and you needed 1000 cores to run Solana.
00:30:21.580 - 00:30:40.930, Speaker B: In that case, certainly Solana could scale to many more users, it could run many more applications, it could have much larger state how many people could actually validate Solana. In what way are we getting the properties of Solana being a trustless chain that you can verify that it's being run correctly. At this point, you got to trust people who own supercomputers, which there aren't a lot of those, right?
00:30:41.090 - 00:30:41.738, Speaker A: Not yet.
00:30:41.834 - 00:31:17.480, Speaker B: That limitation. Not yet. That limitation on blockchains is what makes it like a city. That is, why can't Ethereum be five times as big? Why can't they just do what binance? Smart chain does is remove the kickstand and just let it go as fast as it can? The reason why they're not doing that is say, look, it's important that Ethereum be validated by hobbyists, by retail users with laptops. Now people have a different idea of what that means, like how much decentralization you need to maintain that property. But at the end of the day, every blockchain respects that property, and that is the fundamental constraint on scaling.
00:31:17.860 - 00:32:21.644, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's why I think it's more like a lot of these blockchains in my mind are more constrained from the ideology standpoint, so just their views and pure technology, because I think now we have at least seen what better execution environments are and what kind of more novel consensus algorithms look like. And then if you continue to scale hardware in theory, you can continue to scale the overall throughput of the network. So I am curious how ultimately it unfolds. Yeah, very interesting. Okay, maybe we can move on. From the L2 standpoint, you kind of describe them as skyscrapers, is how do you see those playing out? Do you think there's many different L2s or those L2s talking to each other? In my point of view, it's. I was just.
00:32:21.644 - 00:32:54.130, Speaker A: Once you have multiple sequencers. To me, in my mind, it's just adding another blockchain on top of a current blockchain, and then you have all the same kind of problems. Ideally you have a single sequencer, which would help a lot, but I think that's a little bit of a challenge. How are you thinking about L2s, and over time, how do those continue to evolve to help general scalability for the layer ones that are constrained by kind of the hardware standpoint at the layer one?
00:32:55.110 - 00:33:34.620, Speaker B: It's a good question. So, I mean, the first answer is that I'm still very uncertain about how L2 is going to play out. I wrote a piece last year called I'm worried nobody's going to care about roll ups that encapsulates a lot of my thoughts about this space. The problem with roll ups, that roll ups have become so ideological, they've obviously been now embedded into the Ethereum roadmap. People believe that roll ups are the one true way. They're the only clean and pure way to scale Ethereum. And anytime that you get this much riding on a single technology, you're going to get distortions in how they're perceived, how they're explained, how they're presented.
00:33:34.620 - 00:34:31.258, Speaker B: Today, of course, the dominant roll ups are optimistic roll ups, basically arbitrum and optimism. Optimistic rollups have a number of issues that prevent them from being quite as flexible as what ZK rollups can do. Because optimistic roll ups, they tend to have very long challenge periods, meaning that you need seven days to fully withdraw or to fully clear withdrawal. They're basically a constant factor of scaling in terms of cost. I mentioned constant factor in terms of okay, you got to run gethenne. But there's also a cost factor, because every transaction that you do, on every transaction that you do, you have to still pay l one fees because you're posting data to l one. Now, ZK rollups, which are coming not just Zk roll ups in general, but generalizable ZK rollups like ZkVM type roll ups that allow you to execute ethereum contracts in zero knowledge on zero knowledge roll ups.
00:34:31.258 - 00:34:57.768, Speaker B: Those are coming. Matterlabs is already in testnet with Zksync. We just saw earlier today. Polygon is doing the testnet of their ZkVM. So there's a lot happening in the space. Zkvms are, I think in the long run, more interesting than optimistic approach, because the ZK approach, there is no challenge, period. Basically, as soon as the proof is posted on chain, it's valid and withdrawal can go through.
00:34:57.768 - 00:35:53.566, Speaker B: There's no sitting around and waiting. The other thing is that the fees are lower, so you can actually have higher cost savings. And lastly, the really nice thing about it is that there's a lot of other fancier stuff that you can do, such as using something like a validium instead of a pure roll up. So validium is basically a system where you post the data availability or the data for data availability somewhere other than on Ethereum. L1 the reason why in the ZK version you can do that, and it's very dangerous to do that in the optimistic version, is that in the optimistic version, the downside, if somebody is posting bad data and nobody can find where the bad data is, is that somebody basically does fake straight transitions, somebody corrupts the state or steals money, and nobody can prove what happened. In the ZK version, it is impossible to do corrupt state transitions. It's impossible to steal money from someone.
00:35:53.566 - 00:36:45.256, Speaker B: It's impossible to do things like that. What you can do is you can grief somebody by not letting them see the state of the chain and not letting them be able to exit their deposit. But you can freeze people up, but you can't actually steal their money proactively. That becomes a big security difference in that you'd be more willing to take the risk of having data being stored somewhere else than on Ethereum in the case of a zero knowledge roll up situation than in a in an optimistic roll up situation. If you actually do that, then you get the advantage that now fees can be extremely low because almost all the fees in a roll up are posting onto l one. If you're not posting onto l one, you're only posting proofs then now the fees are amortized just over posting proofs. And posting proofs is basically like a constant factor.
00:36:45.256 - 00:37:01.120, Speaker B: So that allows ZK roll ups to become very, very cheap over time if they start posting their data to non ethereum l one s. And that seems super, super interesting to me in the long run of how rollups can just be as cheap as like a solana or as a polygon.
00:37:01.280 - 00:37:22.060, Speaker A: I definitely agree. I think ZK rollups over the long term are definitely the more interesting technology. Do you think ultimately ZK rollups, or I mean not ZK rollups, do you think those fees paid by rollups in general will be cheaper than say like fees per contract.
00:37:24.180 - 00:37:25.652, Speaker B: Then fees per contract.
00:37:25.796 - 00:37:28.988, Speaker A: Meaning like on the parallelization? Yes.
00:37:29.044 - 00:37:29.500, Speaker B: Oh I see.
00:37:29.540 - 00:37:43.080, Speaker A: For something, if you can isolate the specific parts of state, will they be comparable? I mean, I guess always if you're doing the l two, you're doing some amount of data compression back down to the l one. So it should be cheaper.
00:37:43.860 - 00:38:01.798, Speaker B: But I mean the answer is that you don't know in advance because these are all markets and any market, the question of whats it going to cost is theres two factors, which is supply and demand. So if theres not enough supply for the demand, price will go up.
00:38:01.854 - 00:38:37.700, Speaker A: Maybe this is like a good jumping off point. Ultimately. I kind of think block space today is more of a luxury just because it is constrained. I think going forward these newer chains, aptos and sweat and Solana, just by continuing to scale with hardware, are trying to make it more of a commodity. How do you see block space holistically playing out in the future? Do you think it's just an indefinite supply of block space, or there is some amount of cap, or that we have to limit those resources.
00:38:39.040 - 00:39:10.200, Speaker B: It's a great question. I'm going to go back to the city's analogy because I think, again, this is one of the places where it just keeps producing, it keeps working. So it's like asking the question. So I think the most valuable resource is land. Do you think that land will ever become commodified or that, like, that land will still be a scarce resource? The reality is that there's so much land in America that is just sitting there doing nothing. There's just a bunch of empty land that we could build cities on, but they're just sitting there. They're very low value land.
00:39:10.200 - 00:39:43.700, Speaker B: The reality is that the land you really want is the land in Manhattan, it's the land in La, it's the land in the bay area. That's the land you really care about. And most of the other land is just worthless. It's just a place for cows to graze. I think the same thing is true in blockchain and crypto, is that the idea that block space can become commodified is, I think, a non sequitur. You can create more block space in places that matter by building more and becoming more efficient with the way you build. So Solana could scale, in which case, Solanas block space.
00:39:43.700 - 00:40:35.524, Speaker B: I think Solanas block space is valuable, and people would want to build more stuff in Solanas block space. It has a lot of empty space right now, but eventually that space will get filled and Solana will get full, and then the price of block space will go up. Same thing is true for every chain. The hope has to be that we get better at building, we get more efficient at building, the same way that every major city in the last 200 years has become much more efficient at fitting people into the same amount of space. That is the goal of blockchain scalability in the vertical sense of improving the scalability for a particular blockchain. But in the long run, it is also clearly true that we're going to need more cities, but the very, very tail end of just totally unbranded block space is not going to be valuable ever in the same way that land in the middle of nowhere in Missouri is not going to be valuable ever.
00:40:35.612 - 00:41:17.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Okay, I want to be cognitive time, so let's kind of segue a bit to bridges. Keeping on the city analogy, do you just think the bridges and the interoperability of these bridges is kind of paramount to go back and forth from these different cities and maybe like overarching. Like I want to kind of start or keep back in both of our minds just like the theme of usability and users. And that's one thing that I have a hard time with. L two s, and the different ltus or the different cities is just thinking about from the user aspect or the product aspect, going from all these things.
00:41:17.830 - 00:41:23.050, Speaker A: And maybe bridges is the answer in your mind, but I would love to hear your thoughts.
00:41:23.670 - 00:41:49.126, Speaker B: Yeah, so bridges, I mean, the natural analogy in the city's analogy is highways, right? So these are the systems that actually connect up cities to each other and make it really easy to go from city to city. In the case of bridges, it's very clear today that bridges suck. Like the Ux of bridges suck. It's super fraught. They get hacked all the time, obviously. But even beyond that, it's just very difficult to navigate. These are not user friendly apparatuses.
00:41:49.126 - 00:42:29.864, Speaker B: So in the long run, to my mind, the way that interoperability has to work eventually is that it has to destroy the distinctions between being on different chains. And so what I mean by that is, as a user right now, if you want to use Solana, you want to use avalanche, you want to use Polygon, you have to manage all the complexity yourself. You have to manage, where are your assets? Where is the bridge? How long is the bridge taking? Are your assets fully bridged yet? Check the transaction on chain. Make sure you manage your RPC, endpoint, blah, blah, blah. Do all this stuff, every piece of that, you got a diligence yourself. Is this the right bridge I should use? Is there enough liquidity on the other side? This is the wrong form of USCc. That's not going to be accepted anywhere on this other chain in the future.
00:42:29.864 - 00:42:59.080, Speaker B: And I think the not too far future, all this shit should be managed by your wallet, not by you. So in the future, the affordance is going to be that you just have a wallet. And in that wallet you have assets. And those assets you might want to know, like, okay, I have some. USCC, is that USCC? Is that polygon? USCC is that Solana? USCC. But from the perspective of the user, you don't need to care if you don't want to care, right? You just have USCC. And if you're like, look, I want to interact with Solana today, and I want to go do some thing on Solana.
00:42:59.080 - 00:43:39.180, Speaker B: It says, okay, cool. When interact with Solana, we're going to go ahead and bridge your stuff to Solana, and you don't need to know how it's happening, because why would you care? And why would you be good at this? Right? Like, this is something that software should figure out for you, is that it says, okay, cool, we're going to do a meta transaction because, you know, you don't have any, you don't have any soul to pay gas. We're going to do a meta transaction to, like, bridge your polygon thing from here to here to here to here. And, like, that'll just happen. Just, it's going to take about two minutes, timers taken down, and then boom, you've got your soul in hand now, or your USCC in hand, and all this stuff is just managed for you. This should not be humans making these decisions from the perspective of a user. There should just be applications.
00:43:39.180 - 00:43:50.842, Speaker B: It might take a little bit longer if it's on Solana because you don't have any access there. You're not ready to go. At the end of the day, that complexity should not be pushed to the user, it should be pushed to the software.
00:43:50.946 - 00:44:59.680, Speaker A: I definitely agree. I think I'm interested to see from a technology standpoint, because I think there's just some fundamental limitations that as much as the software can handle, much more complexity than it takes today. How much of just some of the core technology pieces it cannot abstract, going from an l two to an l one or a different l one to l one? It definitely can be much better today and definitely much safer. But maybe. What are your thoughts? One of the things that I asked Anatoly today, and kind of his point of view on the app chain thesis, is that it's more intranets than the Internet. I'm curious to if there's some core limitations from the technology standpoint that just cannot be abstracted away from either latency or finality standpoint. Do you think? Naturally, I mean, maybe going back to the city analogy, the most highly user adopted city just gains the most market share because it's just more frictionless than other chains.
00:45:05.260 - 00:45:38.436, Speaker B: Possibly. Possibly. When you think about app chains, the analogy in the cities analogy to app chains would be like a town that basically is like a company town. So I think of the NASA campus that's in one city where everyone there works for NASA, and that's the only reason to be there. That kind of thing exists, but it's not huge. It's not a major part of how our economy is structured. And in fact, cities tend to be the major way that the economy is structured.
00:45:38.436 - 00:46:13.360, Speaker B: And there's some things that really need that kind of architecture, but for the most part, it's kind of a niche thing. And that's also true. Descriptively, if you look at app chains today, every app chain is way smaller than the major l one s. The vast majority of value is located in the l one s. If you just look in Coinmarketcap. And I think in a way, I mean, again, this is not so much a prediction as it is a description of the current state of affairs, but I think that's likely to persist. I think it's likely going to be the case that although app chains have a place and there are people who want to have app chains, app chains do lose out on most of the advantages of being in blockchains, which is not just that, okay, it's decentralized.
00:46:13.360 - 00:46:46.670, Speaker B: Which is like, okay, fucking who cares that it's decentralized? The thing that people really care about is that it plugs into all the other magical stuff you can do on chain and app chains. Almost by definition, they forego that in order to be isolated in their own state bubble, so that they don't deal with noisy neighbors, they don't deal with contention over state. And I can understand why they would want that. But it doesn't seem to me like this is going to be where the lion's share of innovation and value in crypto gets created.
00:46:47.010 - 00:47:16.390, Speaker A: That makes sense. Maybe last topic on infrastructure stuff, and then talk more about the application layer holistically. Do you have a preference that you think will become more dominant and have a majority of the market share with like charting or app chain or monolithic chains? Or do you think it's going to just be again, like spread out and people just kind of pick and choose?
00:47:20.170 - 00:47:28.288, Speaker B: I don't have super high confidence. I don't know. I think it's very path dependent. I think it really matters who executes well.
00:47:28.394 - 00:47:40.880, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw your podcast, I think you did a while back with bankless and you, I think, mentioned your confidence level was like, ETH was at like 50 or 60% of like market shap over time. Do you still believe that?
00:47:41.740 - 00:47:50.160, Speaker B: Probably. Probably. I think it's a pretty safe bet that ETH is going to continue being ETH for a very long time.
00:47:51.460 - 00:47:53.560, Speaker A: I'm curious to see how it plays out.
00:47:53.860 - 00:47:55.080, Speaker B: I am too.
00:47:56.180 - 00:48:04.826, Speaker A: Yeah, I want things to scale and then I want users. And then I'll kind of. I really want users ultimately.
00:48:04.938 - 00:48:26.968, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I think in the long run, look, the EVM has to grow up for Ethereum to really scale. And right now the EVM is just, you know, it's like, it's like JavaScript in 2005, you know, it's extremely, extremely bad and needs a lot of improvement before it can really get to that point where Ethereum based architectures can scale.
00:48:27.064 - 00:48:44.940, Speaker A: The hard part is if they tried to add parallelism, I know a lot of people actually have tried and are continuing to try to do. It just breaks that backwards compatibility, which kind of sucks. One of the negatives of being, I guess, the first mover, but. Yeah, okay, kind of moving. Sorry, you have something?
00:48:45.280 - 00:49:16.194, Speaker B: Oh, I was just going to say, I think there are ways to do it that maintain backwards compatibility such that you can give, you can give extra information to the runtime in order to make it do things more efficiently and save on gas costs. If you basically help us run faster code, you'll pay less gas. So I think there are ways to do it, but the reality is, within Ethereum itself, there is just so much risk aversion, which is probably appropriate that this stuff has to happen outside of Ethereum.
00:49:16.282 - 00:49:43.828, Speaker A: That makes sense. Cool. So a long kind of conversation on just like cities and countries and the highways in between them. But ultimately, I think what you and I are both aligned on is getting more users into these things. What are you and Dragonfly specifically excited about on the application front with, even on these, Ethan? Some of these newer l one s.
00:49:43.844 - 00:50:41.750, Speaker B: Today, yeah, we continue to be excited by Defi. I still think Defi is one of the core things about crypto that makes crypto crypto. I think for a lot of the web3 stuff, it does feel like we're still quite early in figuring out what are going to be the killer apps of web3 nfts and the creator economy. Although prices have obviously come down and there's been some kind of cooling of heads, I still think nfts are here to stay and theyre going to be a big part of how crypto is understood to the wider world, beyond just the financial use cases. At the end of the day, I think we still dont know. And this was how I felt in 2017, 2018 as well, is that after the last market collapse, there was a strong feeling that this wasnt it. But there's still something, there's some kernel here that is going to evolve into something bigger.
00:50:41.750 - 00:51:13.120, Speaker B: For icos, it became DeFi. The first use case of DeFi was capital formation, which is what icos were, but there became many, many more things beyond just capital formation. The same thing feels very true to me today about web3 is that we have these little glimpses of what's possible, but we haven't found the thing yet. When we find the thing, it's going to be absolutely massive and it's going to be very, very reminiscent of the things that we're trying right now. You can see the glimmer that there's a there there, but we just don't quite. We haven't been able to quite resolve it yet.
00:51:13.280 - 00:51:52.330, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, no, Defi, I mean, yeah, I was super excited in 2020 once Defi summer was happening and all the farm tokens. I was still at Tesla at the time and I had very little time to do any blockchain research, but in the little time that I did, I, I was just looking at different food tokens. But Nfts kind of caught me off guard about how hard they came on into the general kind of universe and how much normal people in the culture. Ultimately, what brought along that NFTs brought along with them kind of influenced everything. It was cool to watch.
00:51:52.910 - 00:52:21.682, Speaker B: Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, look, I was very much caught off guard by nfts as well. It took me a while to understand that this is not a bubble and that these things were here to stay, but its been fascinating to see thats one of the great things about being in crypto and being an investor in crypto is that you get a front row seat to see how one of the most interesting technological phenomena of the last 50 years is playing out right in front of you. I wouldnt trade it for anything.
00:52:21.786 - 00:52:52.790, Speaker A: No, it's. I think this is definitely the coolest thing going on in technology today. I think if I wasn't in crypto, I'd maybe do CRISPR, which is fascinating. A whole different topic, but definitely, definitely no cool. I really appreciate your time. Again, it's been a lot of fun. I try to wrap up the podcast with kind of spicy takes on things that you believe that the industry does not believe or.
00:52:52.790 - 00:53:06.530, Speaker A: Yeah, so maybe if you have kind of a contrary take against like the broader market. Love to hear that spicy take. And then I can ask like one or two more.
00:53:06.990 - 00:53:09.370, Speaker B: Hmm, my spicy take.
00:53:11.590 - 00:53:12.110, Speaker A: Cool.
00:53:12.190 - 00:53:38.900, Speaker B: I mean, well, I got in hot water recently for being kind of pro, not pro. What would I say? Basically saying that I think the abolition of royalties for nfts is inevitable. It's not necessarily like a moral claim, but more of a descriptive claim of like, how I think the world is going to evolve. That seemed to upset a lot of people. So maybe that's the most apropos hot take, given that we're sponsored by magic Eden.
00:53:39.680 - 00:53:46.040, Speaker A: Yes, yes. I would say my spicy take is. I'm kind of bearish, Ethan, long term.
00:53:46.780 - 00:53:49.000, Speaker B: Oh shit. Okay. Why? So.
00:53:51.260 - 00:54:19.974, Speaker A: I think Eth is optimized for the ncrack things. Long term. I'm going back to the usability standpoint. Very interested in the user applications of these things. And I think with just a very small subset of people using these things, I'm. I don't know, it's not really like the vision that I signed up for. I'm very much interested in these more next generation blockchains that have scalability at the core focus.
00:54:19.974 - 00:54:33.050, Speaker A: And I think it's, in my mind, almost impossible to scale without hardware, even with l two s and data compression. So I'm very curious to see how it ultimately unfolds long term.
00:54:33.590 - 00:54:43.522, Speaker B: Right. I totally understand your point and I think it's a reasonable one. I don't know. In the wrong one, nobody really knows what makes an l one valuable.
00:54:43.666 - 00:54:44.106, Speaker A: Yes.
00:54:44.178 - 00:54:46.514, Speaker B: Like, we don't have a good model of any of this stuff.
00:54:46.562 - 00:54:48.470, Speaker A: Valuations are different from the tech.
00:54:48.930 - 00:54:55.178, Speaker B: Yes, yes, that is true. That is very true. But you're saying you're bearish on eth, not bearish on ethereum.
00:54:55.354 - 00:55:23.012, Speaker A: I'm bearish on. Well, both. Yeah. I don't think I view it more as like maybe not operating systems, but I do think it was like the first mover. And this is like, again, I was an EtH maxi at one point. I've just learned a lot from the technical standpoint. My point of view is ETH is more like BlackBerry and there's newer things that will ultimately come around.
00:55:23.012 - 00:55:34.680, Speaker A: And because not very many users and developers in general have used these things, they have no allegiances. And ultimately new things I think will surpass it.
00:55:35.080 - 00:55:53.260, Speaker B: Hmm. It's possible. It's definitely possible. And I think the likelihood of that is low, but it's definitely not zero. And it's not 10% either. So it's somewhere, I don't know where I'd peg it, but I do think what you're saying is a world you need to take seriously.
00:55:54.520 - 00:56:03.050, Speaker A: Any spicy? That's pretty spicy. Any spicy takes that you could ratch up a little bit of? If not, we can end it.
00:56:03.950 - 00:56:08.250, Speaker B: I think I've given enough spice for one day. I'll cut my losses.
00:56:08.550 - 00:56:12.250, Speaker A: Well, again, I really appreciate it. It was a lot of fun.
00:56:12.590 - 00:56:15.830, Speaker B: Absolutely. Logan, it was a pleasure. Awesome, thanks for having me on. Awesome.
