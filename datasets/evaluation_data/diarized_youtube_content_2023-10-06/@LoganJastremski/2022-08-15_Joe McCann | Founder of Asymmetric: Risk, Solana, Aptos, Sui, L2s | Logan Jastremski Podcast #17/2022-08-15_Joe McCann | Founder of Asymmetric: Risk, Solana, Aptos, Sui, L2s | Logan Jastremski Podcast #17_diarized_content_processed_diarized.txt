00:00:05.520 - 00:00:16.422, Speaker A: All right, cool. No, thank you, Joe. Super excited to have you on the podcast. Excited to be here in Portland as well.
00:00:16.566 - 00:00:23.030, Speaker B: Yeah, great to be here. It was awesome to get the opportunity to do an in person one. Usually I'm doing this over a video chat, so this is great.
00:00:23.110 - 00:00:56.898, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I really appreciate it. I think maybe we won't dive, like, too deep in your background. I think most people, if they want to, can learn more about you, but I'm super interested in kind of your background as a trader. I know you have risk, the tattoo on your wrist. I would love to learn more just kind of about how you view risk and management, because I think that's super unique and something that's very much needed in the blockchain and crypto space.
00:00:57.074 - 00:01:10.370, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, um. So I've. I've technically been a trader since the year 2000, which is. Was a very interesting time to learn trading and programming. Actually, that's when I learned both of those things. Um.
00:01:10.370 - 00:01:35.622, Speaker B: Cause I have a degree in philosophy. So, you know, that either gets you into law school or you kind of figure out how to teach yourself stuff. So I taught myself programming and trading, but I've been really fascinated with math and patterns and numbers since I was just a little kid. So I think my younger brother reminded me when I went and worked at a hedge fund in 2018. He was like, yeah, I'm not surprised. I go, what do you mean? He's like, the first book you checked out of a public library was stock market.
00:01:35.766 - 00:01:42.206, Speaker A: You were eight years old, and I looked on your LinkedIn. What it was even funnier to me was that it was called SMB Capital.
00:01:42.358 - 00:02:05.850, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that was the. So that was the first trading desk that I worked at. It wasn't even the first hedge fund. That was just the prop desk. So, like, when I even at a young age, like, I was very fascinated with markets, numbers, patterns, just sort of thing, but then didn't really get super active into trading until the early two thousands. And I've talked about this a little bit in the past on podcasts, interviews that I've done where I kind of feel like, you know, you have to.
00:02:05.850 - 00:02:26.028, Speaker B: You kind of have to blow up twice. Right. In order. Like, it's just such a shitty thing. But it's true. It's. And the reason that I think that is the case is that if you get really lucky in a bull market, you will have a false sense of security, you'll have a false sense of risk management, because you probably didn't have any risk management, you probably were just like, yolo long.
00:02:26.028 - 00:02:42.590, Speaker B: And then you're like, wow, I made a bunch of money. This is so easy, right? So I think you got to blow up once, get that gut feeling of just, man, this is the worst. Everybody that's blown up knows what that feeling is like. If you haven't blown up, you don't know what that feeling is like. It's really that simple. Like, you either have felt it or you haven't. And then.
00:02:42.590 - 00:03:18.508, Speaker B: So then you're like, all right, I'm gonna work my way, be smarter. I'm gonna take profits. I'm gonna limit downside, whatever. And then you blow up again. Now you're ready. The reason I kind of have that perspective is that if you blow up once, you can kind of think about it as, oh, this was just some kind of idiosyncrasy, or, this was just like, black Swan style event, or, this is a one off thing. If you do it twice, you have no one to blame but yourself, and then it forces you into having some form of either internal or, you know, accountable risk management.
00:03:18.508 - 00:03:40.350, Speaker B: Like, you have to. No one can take that away from you, that it's your fault. Right. So there are a couple of maxims I tend to live by, and this isn't just in trading, but it certain apply. Certainly applies to my trading, which is the first is I look for asymmetry. So I look for trades that have asymmetric upside with limited to no downside. Right.
00:03:40.350 - 00:04:15.500, Speaker B: Hence the name of my fund. Asymmetric. Yep. And the reason is, it comes from, I'm a big fan of Nicholas Nassim Taleb's writings, and Taleb is, in my opinion, a more modern day extension of Friedrich Nietzsche. And a lot of the philosophy, like the policies that he kind of put out in his. In his philosophy. One of those is to, you know, Nietzsche has this concept of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? And so Taleb takes this one step further and says, you know, what doesn't kill you? What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
00:04:15.500 - 00:04:38.500, Speaker B: But you should always be in the game. Right? And so there's this idea of avoiding the risk of ruin. This is something that I've talked about in the past, where, to use a rather morose example, if you play the game russian roulette, you have a one out of six chance of losing. Right. Five out of six chance of winning. Those are pretty good odds. Right.
00:04:38.500 - 00:05:32.350, Speaker B: Except when you're wrong, you literally cannot play ever again. Right. And I think that that is one of the things that is so crystallizing about trading in crypto is that leverage is a hell of a drug. Arthur Hayes at BitMex really got people hooked on it, and all the other exchanges have taken his lead. If you just survive in this industry, you will do well. And I think that this is part of the reason why I kind of, I try to even, you know, when I get into a fomo state or recognize that, like, you know, things are running really hot or maybe I'm mega bearish, you know, I try to just be like, all right, all you have to do is survive. And if you avoid the risk of ruin and identify opportunities that have asymmetric upside with limited to no downside, it's really a recipe for success, I think, in crypto, all up.
00:05:32.430 - 00:06:18.878, Speaker A: No, I totally agree. I mean, I think the biggest thing, I mean, definitely having risk management is extremely, extremely important. But yeah, I totally agree with just ultimately in crypto, the market today is still so small with like around say, a trillion dollars, that over the long term, how big this market is going to get if you can just survive and go through, I mean, now these past cycles, and hopefully, well, not less cycles, but as the market continues to mature over the long term and liquidity continues to inflow into the entire ecosystem, surviving and just being in the ecosystem and continuing to play is extremely important.
00:06:19.014 - 00:06:52.136, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, total crypto market cap peaked in 2021 in November, around $3 trillion. It's back at about one to $1.1 trillion depending on when this podcast airs. It may be a little more, maybe a little less, but let's just call it a trillion dollars. Gold is $20 trillion, right? Gold is a rock, right? Like, there is no, like, it's, I mean, yeah, it's an inflation hedge, but, like, why do we even care that a rock has value? Because we all believe that it has value. And yes, people are going to say you can use it in semiconductors and this and that. It's like, fine, it's not worth $20 trillion.
00:06:52.208 - 00:06:52.416, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:52.448 - 00:07:55.586, Speaker B: It's just not relative to, like, completely rewriting the concept of the financial system through digital assets and decentralized and permissionless networks. And so the question that I tend to ask myself, and we'll ask other people that have been dejected in the current bear market, is do you think crypto is higher or lower than $1 trillion in five years? Do you think it's higher or lower? I mean, really, it's. Ask yourself that question, and if the answer is it's lower. Okay, that's totally fair. I respectfully disagree with you. But I think that, look, if gold's trading 20 trillion global equities are an order of magnitude larger than that, I mean, there's enough of a reference for these other asset classes to look at something like crypto and say, could this be a $10 trillion asset class? Could this be a $5 trillion asset class? I think the answer is, like, with a high probability. Yes, certainly it could not be.
00:07:55.586 - 00:08:46.631, Speaker B: But also, I think this also alludes itself to the current correlation that you've seen with crypto trading, very heavily correlated with Nasdaq right now. Right. So a lot of folks are looking at crypto or web3 or the combination of the two as an extension of high tech growth, like very early stage, very, you know, almost like biotech or something. Right? Like really ambitious, high failure rate, these type of things. If those assets, if, for example, the Nasdaq starts to retreat back towards all time highs, what do you think happens to crypto? Right? And then as more and more, as you mentioned, institutional flow comes into the market, you have more retail users. In normal use cases, whether this is through nfts, video games, there's so many different avenues that people can use crypto without actually, you know, having to, like, swap on, on, you know, serum or something like. Right.
00:08:46.631 - 00:09:38.482, Speaker B: Like, this is a very real thing. And by the way, we've seen this in previous technology cycles. You have this kind of, like almost, it's almost cliche at this point where people at first just completely ignore it. Then, you know, they, they make fun of it, then they, they do everything they can to stop it. You know, this is, this is terrible for the environment or this is terrible for humanity or this is. Right. It's just crazy because I've worked in tech for a long time, and there's some guys that I deeply admire in the kind of web two cloud computing space wrote this pathetic letter to, like, the US Congress about, like, can you please do something? And it was just, you know, on the one hand, I'm like, man, this is so sad that these guys are at this point of their career where they're literally writing a letter to Congress about the advancement of technology that they don't have to participate in.
00:09:38.482 - 00:09:38.866, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:38.938 - 00:09:39.306, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:39.378 - 00:10:30.070, Speaker B: But when you start to see stuff like that, it just makes me so bullish on the space because I'm like, if those things weren't happening, I would be a little bit more concerned. Right. You have this kind of, like, visceral reaction from, from incumbents against a new technology, and it strengthens the resolve of the people that are behind it. Like, you know, you look at the advancement in developer ecosystems, you look at how many people are actually using crypto without recognizing that they're using it. These are, these are numbers that are just indisputable and undeniable for a kind of a shift forward in technology. And this has been the same thing like even the early Internet days, right? Like Paul Krugman famously said, the Internet will have no bigger impact than the fax machine. How wrong could he have possibly been? We're seeing the exact same sort of platitudes launched out there.
00:10:30.070 - 00:10:46.428, Speaker B: Bye. Incumbents and pundits and folks that are, have their own self interest in mind. But having those types of positions out there, I think just strengthens the case for why this is going to actually survive and ultimately thrive as well.
00:10:46.484 - 00:11:33.818, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's a very similar story to Tesla, in my opinion. When I initially joined Tesla, my old coworkers were like, why are you joining Tesla? They're about to go bankrupt. Like, they're not going to do anything cool like their cars catch on fire. And so it is funny. The story definitely repeats. And I think another thing that I've seen you mention in some other podcasts that you've done is kind of like that pattern recognition and how you've kind of built that over time, being in technology for as long as you have, kind of, what are the things that you look out for? And how does that also kind of map to, like, crypto today? I mean, we, I think we kind of went through it, but if you could expand upon it.
00:11:33.834 - 00:12:34.900, Speaker B: Yeah, this is, um, this is probably where my, my pseudo philosophical background comes into play because, um, there's, there's actually kind of a method to the madness that I have around this pattern recognition. Right. So I'll try to explain this as best I can, but, um, when I was actually working at Microsoft, drafted this kind of framework, because when I was there, a lot of the work that I was doing was kind of like emerging technology strategy work in the cloud and AI organization. And the challenge with this is that for someone who's primarily been an entrepreneur or certainly kind of like on the bleeding edge of a lot of, call it newer technology or emerging technology, it's hard to institutionalize that at a place like Microsoft or Google or Amazon or any of these other large tech companies. Right, Microsoft, great place to work. Love my gig there. But they were, I realized that I was like, you actually can't teach innovation that's like a paradox, right? Like, it's like going to school for business or something.
00:12:34.900 - 00:13:34.234, Speaker B: Like, no disrespect, anybody's got an MBA, but, like, the best way to learn how to run a business is to run a business. So the best way to, like, do innovative things is to, like, innovate. I know it sounds a little bit, you know, sophomore, but the point that I'm getting to is that I tried to. What I was, what dawned on me was I was like, a lot of these folks that are in this large organization, been in a long time, they don't think it's, like, hard to, like, get them to express beyond this kind of tight silo that they've been in for so long. I said, all right, I have to think about a framework that can help stimulate serendipity to identify patterns that may lead to some sort of, like, potential, you know, high outcome for new product or service or technology or whatever, right? So the first one is this book by this guy named Daniel Epstein, no relation to Jeffrey Epstein, to be very clear. He's a really awesome guy and author called range. And this book, range, it kind of.
00:13:34.234 - 00:14:08.138, Speaker B: It disputes this old adage that, you know, you need to specialize on one thing. You need to do 10,000 hours to practice something, and then you'll be really good at it, and it's all nonsense. So, for example, he opens up the book talking about Tiger Woods. Tiger woods are arguably one of the greatest, if not the greatest golfer to ever play the game. You know, has been hitting golf balls since he was, like, basically in the womb, right? Like, practically. He was constantly practicing and constantly, you know, performing one of the greatest golfers ever. Conversely to Roger Federer.
00:14:08.138 - 00:14:37.980, Speaker B: A lot of people don't know this. He grew up his entire, like, adolescence and teenager, or pre adolescence and adolescence years not playing tennis. In fact, he played every other sport except tennis, and his parents were tennis instructors, really. And then he picked up tennis when he was 18, went on to become, like, the greatest tennis player ever. Right. Why is that the case? Well, on the one hand, he was. He did a bunch of different things, and then he found his kind of, like, true calling or whatever versus this kind of specialization.
00:14:37.980 - 00:15:38.340, Speaker B: Right? And so the thing that. The interesting thing about the Tiger woods versus Roger Federer example is, is that in the book range, he goes through countless examples, not just through sports, but through all kinds of different scenarios where having a more generalized skill set or set of experiences or, you know, kind of opening yourself up to a lot of different disciplines or interests or whatever benefits you longer term than, say, someone who's very, very specialized. So that's one aspect. The other aspect is there's a book by this guy named Rory Sutherland called Alchemy. Roy Sutherland is, I think he's one of, like, the top creative directors or VP or something at Ogilvy, which is a very famous creative ad agency. He wrote this incredible book, alchemy, where it kind of uses counterintuitive thinking for problem solving. His point is that if there's a really tough problem to solve, it's very likely that the rational answer isn't going to work, because it would have been found at this point.
00:15:38.340 - 00:16:18.548, Speaker B: It's so patently obvious that this just makes sense. This is how you solve the problem that hasn't solved it. There must be some weird counterintuitive way to solve it. I'll give you an example. They did this thing, this study, where there were these guys that had this kind of. This coffee shop, and they were like, how do we get people to, you know, recognize that we're open? How do we get more people coming into the coffee shop? And instead of, like, running an ad or putting a big sign that says open, they use counterintuitive thinking, where they placed chairs out in front of the cafe. That was a signal to everyone else that, hey, we're actually open.
00:16:18.548 - 00:16:56.568, Speaker B: People would come sit down, which then was a further signal that they were open and more and more people. So my point is that the obvious answer is, we'll just run an ad in a newspaper or online or whatever, or the obvious answer is, put an open sign in your window. No, it's actually something completely counterintuitive. So, one, have a broad range of interests that you look into. Two, think about using counter intuition to solve these really challenging problems. And then three, this gets back to CK symmetry. And so if you put these three together, what ends up happening is you'll start to pick certain aspects of your life that you don't think have anything to do with, say, making an investment in crypto or.
00:16:56.568 - 00:17:16.654, Speaker B: But then you can forecast what may actually happen. So I'll give you an example, because I know there's, like, a bunch of philosophical bullshit that I just mentioned. People are probably like, can this sky just be a little bit more crystal clear here? So here's a. Here's a pattern that I've recognized, and. And I need to write a blog post about this. I haven't. Just haven't had a chance.
00:17:16.654 - 00:17:48.470, Speaker B: So, in. In the early days of social media, particularly a little bit past, like the MySpace Facebook era. We had Twitter launch, I think in 2006, I don't remember, 2000, it was mid two thousands or at some point. But like, it hadn't really caught on with a lot of people. And the format, quite literally was the reason there was 140 character limit is that initially they were just. It was just for the. That was the maximum number of characters in SMS in a text.
00:17:48.470 - 00:18:21.152, Speaker B: Right. So Twitter was text based, right? It's very text based. And that meant it attracted an analytical, maybe a little bit more like early adopter, techie, kind of Silicon Valley insider, maybe some media people, but, you know, more like analytical thinking readers, right? Cause it's just text, right? You're going through this endless stream of just text, just text. And then what happened? Well, Instagram launched. And if you looked at Instagram, what is Instagram? Instagram is visual Twitter, right?
00:18:21.216 - 00:18:21.504, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:21.552 - 00:19:00.210, Speaker B: In the earliest days, yes. Now you've got all this other crap on there. But, like, in the earliest days of Instagram, it was literally just a constant scroll of imagery, right, that targets the creative part of people's brains. It doesn't just force them to use this analytical piece, which is reading, which means you're separating that between two different audiences. You've got this analytical group that, like, wants to just sit there and scroll and read and scroll and read and scroll and read. And then you go to, like, the creatives of culture and pop culture and influence, they don't care about Twitter, right? Like, if you look at, if you go and look at, like, Kim Kardashian's number of followers on Instagram and then go to Twitter, they're off by an order of magnitude.
00:19:00.250 - 00:19:00.538, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:00.594 - 00:19:44.212, Speaker B: You know why? Because the audience of pop culture and influence has this more visual, cultural aesthetic associated with it, right? So Instagram blows up, becomes this massive, you know, property. Facebook, of quiz, of course, acquires it. The point that I'm getting to is that you had two different types of social media feeds, one being very text based, very analytical, the other being more creative and expressive and more gravitated towards influence and culture. We're seeing the same pattern today in crypto. So, for example, the first kind of like, few years of Defi, or crypto in general, was really just like early adopters, analytical nerds, you know, sort of like finance people that were trying to get into crypto, right?
00:19:44.276 - 00:19:54.804, Speaker A: When I was watching Defi summer, I was like, this is it, like, it's gonna happen. And I try to get all my friends to use it. And one, like, the gas fees were just too high on eth. But second, like, they didn't care about, like, the defi stuff.
00:19:54.852 - 00:19:55.148, Speaker B: Correct.
00:19:55.204 - 00:20:03.388, Speaker A: And then it wasn't until, like, Solana NfT specifically where it was cheap and the visual component that they're like, oh, this is kind of cool.
00:20:03.484 - 00:20:18.076, Speaker B: So you've already reached the conclusion of my long, drawn out story here. Is that what we're, you know, defy originally a bunch of analytical, but, like, people were just normies, pop culture creatives, influencers, like, they don't, they just didn't care. Right?
00:20:18.108 - 00:20:18.652, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:18.796 - 00:21:16.938, Speaker B: It's the same thing that happened with Twitter. Now you have the Instagram for, for, for crypto is NFTs. You've got this visual representation that gravitates toward that people that of a different ilk gravitate towards. And it's fast, it's cheap, it's all this good stuff. That's an example, a long, drawn out example of a pattern that I try to look for at a very macro level and then dig into that and see where I can invest, whether it's as a private investor, an early stage startup, or protocol, or there's trade to be had or put on. But the point that I'm getting to is that the way that you try to start to identify these large macro patterns has very little to do with reading a book and trying to figure it out. It has more to do with developing this framework of counterintuitive thinking for problem solving and having a broad range of interesting things so that when they start to surface, you're like, oh, I just stitched these things together because this thing kind of happened here somewhat similarly in the past.
00:21:16.938 - 00:21:24.302, Speaker B: It doesn't map one for one perfectly, but it maps well enough that there's a high probability outcome that this is probably going to be the same thing.
00:21:24.366 - 00:22:16.670, Speaker A: That makes sense. No, I like the explanation, and thank you for walking everybody through it. I think one thing. So on the trading aspect, maybe going back to that, I've always been like a trader skeptic, per se. I think for me, like, trying to think about things, like, probabilistically, I, I feel like maybe this is just my novice in the space and not blowing up my account twice. I am just, like, very skeptical of, like, how, like, trying to, like, say, like, eight times out of ten or seven times out of ten, like, getting a trade correct. Is my, like, logic, like, incorrect about, like, how I'm approaching it or like, how do you kind of view trading or, like, good traders? I'm.
00:22:16.670 - 00:22:23.642, Speaker A: I. Yeah, I mean, I don't personally view myself as a trader. I try to just like, be very research driven and like, buy and hold.
00:22:23.706 - 00:22:23.978, Speaker B: Sure.
00:22:24.034 - 00:22:39.600, Speaker A: But how, like, from the trading perspective, like, how do you, or like, which traders have you seen that are like, very good at that, that, like, you respect? Or, I mean, maybe this goes back to, like, applying the methodologies that we just went through, but how do you kind of, like, view that?
00:22:39.980 - 00:22:58.988, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a great, it's a good question because there's a lot in the question to unpack. Right. So, like, on the one hand, there's kind of like, how do I think about trading in general, like probabilities, what dictates, like a good outcome? And then what are the kind of traders that have those characteristics?
00:22:59.044 - 00:22:59.680, Speaker A: Yes.
00:23:00.540 - 00:23:22.220, Speaker B: So the first piece is the thing about probabilities, and this is where, again, my kind of philosophical meets math mind comes into play, is that if someone says that, like, there's an 80% possibility of a recession, that's to me as philosophically bankrupt is basically saying there is or is not going to be a recession. Right.
00:23:22.340 - 00:23:24.004, Speaker A: Is it because the probability is too high?
00:23:24.092 - 00:23:34.214, Speaker B: Well, think about it. Right. It's a probability. If someone says it's 80% and it happens, then what? They have the confirmation bias that their 80% was actually highly weighted. Right?
00:23:34.262 - 00:23:34.534, Speaker A: True.
00:23:34.582 - 00:23:39.630, Speaker B: But then if they say, if it's 80% and it didn't happen, they can say, well, it was only a probability. Do you see what I'm saying?
00:23:39.670 - 00:23:40.246, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:23:40.318 - 00:24:24.146, Speaker B: Right? So I'm not saying that there isn't value in statistics and statistical waiting for outcomes of certain things, right? But the notion that a trade, for example, is going to have like a 75% chance of being a winning trade, I just don't think that's true. I think that's nonsense. I think the way that I think about trading is I look for a confluence of signals or indicators, and this also depends on the trading style. I don't do this anymore, but imagine I was still a very active, active trader. Some people call this day trading, some people call it semi frequent swing trading, whatever you want to call it. But you're relatively active in those types of environments. You're not looking for a confluence of a ton of different events.
00:24:24.146 - 00:24:59.890, Speaker B: You're looking for, like, order flow, really high frequency kind of idiosyncrasies in the tape that will influence your ability to get in and out of a trade quickly. But if you're swing trading or you're doing something a little bit more buy and hold, maybe a little bit more. Sophistication of. There's a couple things you want to look for. There's things like liquidity profiles you want to look at, like options markets, you want to look at technical analysis. And I love the folks that say technical analysis doesn't work because I've built an entire career using technical analysis to work. So if you don't think it works, think again.
00:25:00.230 - 00:25:01.982, Speaker A: So it's not astrology for men.
00:25:02.126 - 00:25:52.772, Speaker B: It is, but the other thing is that, again, but this is where the probabilities come into play, right? So, for example, let's take technical analysis, because this is the thing that everybody loves to hate on and the thing that I love to love. If you look at technical analysis, any of the indicators that deal with technical analysis, human beings are naturally wired to want to understand why something happens, right? Why did this thing happen? I want to dig into why this happened. And so they look at technical analysis and go, oh, this thing is like really oversold. That's why the price is low. It's like, no, no, no. Technical analysis indicators are all backward looking. They're all based on the previous price, right? Or the previous change in whatever the technical analysis indicator may actually be.
00:25:52.772 - 00:26:42.854, Speaker B: And so what I look for is a confluence of TA indicators to identify areas where that may be oversold or overbought, and then away a probability on the outcome of that actually being true. For example, in June, you had Ethereum trading below 1000. You had, I think it was 14 straight weeks of selling off, and I don't think that's ever happened in Ethereum. So 14 weeks of straight selling, right, never happened in Ethereum's history sub 1000, which I don't think a lot of people ever thought they'd see that price again. Sentiment is absolutely in the gutter. All of the technical indicators are deeply oversold. So put these, just these four things together, I put a high probability that that is going to bounce.
00:26:42.854 - 00:27:30.324, Speaker B: Right, like, so for those that say, like, ti doesn't work, it's like, it's not a silver bullet, right? If it was, no one would give it away for free because they can predict the future, right? Instead, it's a confluence of events that enable a high probability outcome. It still doesn't guarantee it. It just means you have a higher kind of level of confidence that it actually occurs. This is why I was kind of making fun of the 80% recession or not recession thing, is that ta, with those confluence events, is still the same thing, right? You can actually look at it and go, all right, I'm going to put on a position I'm going to put a million dollars into ethereum. And if, you know, this thing continues to go lower, then I'm just going to take a stop loss at like whatever, 5%. I'm just making something up. Not financial advice, obviously, but if you have those confluence of events and you put a million dollar trade on, it starts to work in your favor.
00:27:30.324 - 00:27:43.044, Speaker B: It's not because the TA worked, it's because the probability and your entry point was such that you actually had a greater chance of success relative to buying a theory. I'm in November of 2021 when it was at $4,000.
00:27:43.092 - 00:28:13.716, Speaker A: Right. That makes sense. That definitely makes sense. And maybe kind of just to kind of piggyback off that, a lot has happened since. I mean, the kind of like three arrows implosion and Luna implosion. How? Like more holistically, kind of using some of these indicators and patterns that you've seen or developed over the years. Where is your kind of like headspace on? Just like the overview of the markets today.
00:28:13.908 - 00:29:17.240, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the thing that I've learned as a trader for a long time now is that the second that you think you have an edge, it's dull. So you have to constantly be improving on your ability to find new sources of information and data and then kind of grok those sources of information and data. So, for example, for the past twelve years, we've primarily been in an environment of money printing and balance sheet expansion, Federal Reserve. So every time that there was a dip in the market, you know, the, they would print more money or they would just, you know, subsidize something through bond purchases or whatever the thing may be, right. They just keep the party going. What that was doing was that was providing a ton of liquidity into the space, right? And so the thing that has happened over the past, call it seven months, it's now August 8 months, actually, is a reduction in liquidity.
00:29:17.240 - 00:29:37.824, Speaker B: Right. We have not seen a severe reduction in liquidity in the market for over a decade. It just hasn't happened. Right. I think in 2018, Chairman Powell mentioned something and he, like, barely, he like crashed the market because he's going to stop buying bonds or something, right. And the market just couldn't handle it. He's like, oh, no, no, we'll keep the party going.
00:29:37.824 - 00:30:17.090, Speaker B: Right? So on the one hand, people can look at like, oh, you know, it was the.com bubble 2.0. It's nonsense, it's, this is liquidity driven, right. For the past twelve years, if you didn't have a view on liquidity, it didn't matter. You could just be long and make money for the past seven months, if you haven't had a view on liquidity, you've gotten crushed. Right. And so my point of saying this is that the ability to pivot your, your strategy or viewpoint based on these broader things that are happening in the market that may have nothing to do with technical analysis, may have nothing to do with order flow, may have nothing to do with crypto or web3 or any of this.
00:30:17.090 - 00:30:57.620, Speaker B: That is actually how I think you become a really good trader longer term, is that it's not the individual thing that you're a specialist in. It's like the ability to look for these new ways of explaining or understanding what's happening in the market. And so, for example, there's a, there's what I consider a bear market rally occurring right now. Bottom could be in, but to me, still kind of looks like a bear market rally. We could see, we'll know more in a couple of months, September, October timeframe. The reason I continue to focus on liquidity of the current state of the market is that until that improves, typically you have lower asset prices. Right.
00:30:57.620 - 00:31:27.436, Speaker B: We kind of look at this in a pretty, I would say a pretty simplistic view, is when there's high inflation, you have higher interest rates, which means lower asset prices. It's like the most fundamental economic thing. It's really simple, right. It's not that difficult. Now people will say, well, Joe, you know, crypto's bottom and markets have bottom over the past couple of months. It's now August and, you know, s and P is back over 4000 and yada yada, right? It's all true. But that's not the result of, say, the Fed pivoting.
00:31:27.436 - 00:32:13.648, Speaker B: That's not the result of new liquidity entering the market. There's a lot of tactical reasons why that's the case. There's these things called CTA's that have systematic buying that occurs at certain levels where they literally just have to buy billions of dollars worth of stock. When the indices hurts hit certain levels, you have stock buybacks as well that are also causing an uptick in prices of stocks, which then crypto is correlated with stocks. It rises with it. I guess what I'm getting to is that the liquidity piece that has been so fundamentally different over the past eight months from the previous twelve years is one of the biggest factors that, that kind of has influenced my thinking about investing and trading in the space, which I've done very little of this past year, as you can imagine. That aspect is super important.
00:32:13.648 - 00:32:48.420, Speaker B: And then I think the other piece is that when you look at crypto in isolation within the ecosystem, you may find some things here and there, like, that may pop off or may have a huge run, you know, idiosyncratically relative to, like, all of crypto. I don't think we can look at crypto in isolation anymore. Right. You used to be able to do this over the gan, the past ten plus years. You could look at bitcoin and just ridiculously outperforming the s and P and all these stocks, whatever. Right. I don't know if that's going to be the case in a low liquidity environment.
00:32:48.420 - 00:33:08.726, Speaker B: And the notion that crypto is going to be this isolated asset class, excuse me, going forward, possibly it could. Absolutely. That's certainly a possibility. But I tend to now look at it as trading as high tech growth, and that has fundamentally changed the way that I think about trading and investing in the space as well.
00:33:08.798 - 00:33:42.952, Speaker A: That makes sense. I like the overview, maybe to pivot slightly into, like, the actual technology. I've heard in large part, you're chain agnostic. However, you've taken a particular interest in Solana. I think you're one of the early people in the Solana milking business. Now, why Solana specifically has caught your interest? Because I think today, even when I still talk about Solana, people are like, oh, Solana. Which to me is hilarious.
00:33:42.952 - 00:33:49.580, Speaker A: But I'm curious how you kind of came to this conclusion on your own.
00:33:50.640 - 00:34:22.232, Speaker B: Yeah, I get this question a lot, because the easiest answer is, oh, man, I was just lucky. Right. But that is absolutely part of it. I was certainly lucky to be early to Solana. But I think the other piece is that I actually, like, dug into the code and looked at the architecture of it and then understood how the design of Solana was such that it enabled parallelized transactions, which is just fundamentally not. It was not possible in an EVM chain.
00:34:22.296 - 00:34:22.940, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:23.240 - 00:34:29.792, Speaker B: So just that seemingly little breakthrough happens to have a massive impact.
00:34:29.936 - 00:34:48.180, Speaker A: I totally agree. And this is one reason why I'm kind, well, I embarrass ethereum. I used to be, in a theory, maxi bearish etherium, and almost, I mean, the EVM changed because, specifically, because it does not do barrel parallel processing, and it's going to be very hard for them to change that technically, just to break all the backwards compatibility.
00:34:48.840 - 00:35:21.200, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, look, and so this was the thing about, there were a couple of things that kind of led me to be early in Solana, and why right now in 2022, I still see them as like the leading blockchain for the explosion of the types of applications that can and should be built in web3. Could another chain surface in the coming years and usurp them? Certainly. Like, no one is that foolish to have been in tech for too long to be like, this is going to be the thing that outlasts. It's just ridiculous. It's just not how software works. Right.
00:35:21.200 - 00:36:35.308, Speaker B: But the thing about what I think Solana particularly like on the technical side, yes, there was traction to it because of the way that they enabled parallelized transactions by having execution, logic and state be separate. Like that's, it's such a subtle but incredibly powerful concept. So that that's one aspect. The other aspect is though, is that I've been tracking developer ecosystems for a long time, for part of my career, as you're probably aware, I used to be the CEO and co founder of a company called Node Source, which is the Node JS company, which is a wildly successful open source project. So I kind of have some experience understanding how developer ecosystems evolve and grow at a global scale. And Solana had all of the kind of elements in the early days that gave them a tailwind, in my view, for pushing the momentum of the project and enabling developers to actually build on them in a relatively fast and efficient way. For example, if you look at Ethereum, and I am a fan of Ethereum, I'm not bear, I'm not like, you know, this is not by any means derogatory, because I actually do think like, I think that the leap in computer science that Vitalik created with smart contract is amazing.
00:36:35.404 - 00:37:02.188, Speaker A: I totally agree, for the record. And I do think they have a lot of smart people. I think personally, I think they're just optimizing too much on the decentralization stuff. Personally, from the metrics that I have found, when sharding is released, it's going to be doing 1.3 megabytes per second. When you use all that block space on l two s for ZK rollups, you're getting 100,000 transactions per second. I'm just not confident that will be enough.
00:37:02.188 - 00:37:25.500, Speaker A: I know you can do layer threes and continue to compress, but the user experience just kind of gets wacky. So like I, and like, yeah, former Eth max, but I like, I appreciate all the people that are working on it. I just personally think it's kind of optimizing for the wrong thing. And I think scaling and like getting these users into the ecosystem is really what is important. I want people to use blockchain.
00:37:25.580 - 00:37:41.564, Speaker B: Look, I mean, so. Me too. And I think. So the. Again, this is kind of like seeing the pattern or seeing the movie before or whatever. The thing about Ethereum is that it was this breakthrough in computer science. It attracted a lot of what I tend to call academic engineers.
00:37:41.564 - 00:38:19.228, Speaker B: It does not mean that there aren't product engineers building products on Ethereum, but for the most part, the open source community that is attracted towards Ethereum is primarily of the academic elk ilk. Right. They're more kind of like in this super hardcore computer science programming world. And that's great. That is one of the reasons why you get these leaps in computer science and huge leaps of innovation. But no one cares, right? No one cares. And it's sad because, like, you know, people use a Mac all day long at their normal job, and I.
00:38:19.228 - 00:38:52.554, Speaker B: No one cares that it's written in that it was built on Unix. No one actually cares how the sausage is made. And so the thing that drew me to Solana was that, one, you didn't have to learn a new programming language. So the challenge with a lot of these, and this goes for even SwE and Aptos and Starkware, et cetera. Number one, when you become a blockchain developer, you have to learn smart contract programming. And that programming model is fundamentally different than pretty much all of software. Prior to that.
00:38:52.554 - 00:39:13.500, Speaker B: Prior to that, you could just create an application where you created a function. You're like, hey, I want to get the square root of some number. Input is a number, output is the square root. With smart contract programming, inputs are tokens and outputs are transaction ids. It's a very, very, very different programming model. Number one, you have to learn a new programming model. Wrap your head around that.
00:39:13.500 - 00:40:33.448, Speaker B: And then two, you have to learn a new programming language with Ethereum, Starkware, Aptos, swE, et cetera. You don't have to do that with Solana, right? You literally, if you know rust, you can build Solana application immediately. You can use all the same tooling. You can use the best practices that are associated with writing rust applications, all this good stuff, right? So that, coupled with the fact that Solana was actually, they actually had a more deliberate go to market strategy for how they wanted to attract developers and attract culture. You know, I was talking earlier about how culture was sort of engaged with through NFTs, Solana has done something, I think, really remarkable for an open source project where they've actually got, like, normal people interested in Solana. Which is like, you know, as an old open source guy, I'm like, ah, finally somebody cracked the code on this, right? And it's really cool because, you know, you see Solana at like, lollapalooza and I, these huge festivals in Belgium and like, it's just, and they're sponsoring, you know, they're like, they're just, they're engaged with culture and entertainment and where people are. And I think that that is the piece that whether it's Ethereum or any of these other more academically centric chains, like, until they can find a way to bridge into that world of culture and getting more and more people comfortable with this technology and be like, oh, it's fun to use.
00:40:33.448 - 00:41:09.236, Speaker B: Like, no one cares about the program model of Solana. No one actually cares about that. Right? What they care about is like, they're at Lallapalooza and they got this cool NFT and it happened in like half a second. That's what they care about. And I think that that is one of the things that really drew me and still does draw me to things like Solana is that there's more to technology than the technology. There's this. How do you, you know, how do you engage with culture? How do you engage with people? How do you attract developers? How do you support developers? All that kind of stuff is critical to the long term impact that an open source project can have.
00:41:09.236 - 00:41:13.140, Speaker B: And I just feel like today Solana has just done arguably the best job of that.
00:41:13.260 - 00:41:55.588, Speaker A: Yeah, that totally makes sense. And I fully agree. I know. Well, maybe two comments. I know you've also have taken some interest into Cosmos as well. I'm curious, like why Cosmos versus avalanche also does kind of subnets, maybe your interest in either or why you're more focused on one versus the other. And then the second part on the Sui and Aptos side, what are your thoughts on them? Because I think now I don't know if the market has really understood the parallelization thing as of yet.
00:41:55.588 - 00:42:09.280, Speaker A: I think that that process is going ongoing currently. And what I'm excited about specifically those two change is that they're single shard and parallel processing. So maybe some comments there as well.
00:42:09.620 - 00:42:13.268, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So the first part of the question.
00:42:13.324 - 00:42:16.480, Speaker A: Was just like Cosmos and maybe avalanche.
00:42:17.540 - 00:42:47.010, Speaker B: So I don't have a strong opinion on avalanche. I think Emmons brilliant, right? But I recall in the early days of avalanche, again, this is not a derogatory statement or judgment against avalanche. I found it very difficult to understand just using avalanche. Like, there were different wallets and you had to connect to this chain versus that chain. And I was like, I'm pretty technical, and this is already confusing for me. How is this going to work for normal people? Right. But this was, again, very early days of avalanche.
00:42:47.010 - 00:43:07.906, Speaker B: It's probably gotten better. Cosmos stands out to me for a couple of reasons. So, one, again, this is a pattern recognition piece. In 2018 to 19 bear market cycle, you started to have this narrative of enterprise blockchain. And IBM was behind this primarily.
00:43:07.938 - 00:43:09.306, Speaker A: I mean, hyper Ledger.
00:43:09.338 - 00:43:24.594, Speaker B: Hyperledger. Yeah. So Ernst Young, IBM, some really smarteen business development strategists got together and said, how can we get. How can we get promoted? Let's come up with enterprise blockchain. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding, obviously.
00:43:24.594 - 00:43:49.268, Speaker B: But no, look, there was this notion behind enterprise blockchain as being a thing that enterprises wanted to engage with. And like most business development pitches, it was basically smoke and mirrors. Right? There was just really nothing there. And it was instead, they were trying to use technology to solve for a problem that didn't exist. Right. So it failed miserably. Right.
00:43:49.268 - 00:44:10.222, Speaker B: Enterprise blockchain as a narrative failed miserably. But then we started to have a resurgence or an evolution or iteration of what enterprise blockchain could actually mean. And it doesn't mean enterprise blockchain. Excuse me. It means application specific chain. That's actually the iteration that actually matters. Right.
00:44:10.222 - 00:44:30.982, Speaker B: So could you build something that exists in the cosmos ecosystem today on Solana? Yes, absolutely. You could. Right. Meaning, if you. If you wanted to run osmosis, for example, you could. You could do it on Solana, even though that's probably a bad example. But my point is, is that it's.
00:44:30.982 - 00:45:07.242, Speaker B: There's nothing specific to Solana that would say, you can't build this on Solana. Okay, now where am I going with this? If you look at the application specific chain nature of the cosmos ecosystem and IBC, what you get is things like Regen. Regen is a carbon credit marketplace. So on the one hand, you're saying, well, they could have just built that on Ethereum, or they could have just built that on Solana. That is true. But because it's so specific to what they need, they decided to build their own chain for it. And the cosmos ecosystem enables them to do that.
00:45:07.242 - 00:45:44.096, Speaker B: I find that incredibly interesting and valuable. And maybe this is, again, an enterprise blockchain 2.0, and it's all going to crash miserably. But the interesting thing that Cosmos continues to do is they continue to iterate and ship. And so, for example, and I'm drawing a blank on the proposal for that, something that may be changing with respect to IBC. But one of the challenges right now is if you want to launch your own apps, app specific chain, you have to be able to bootstrap a validator set. Right.
00:45:44.096 - 00:45:45.048, Speaker B: It's like the.
00:45:45.144 - 00:46:11.300, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny. I'll plug Babylon real quick. One of the professors at Stanford, David Tsai, he's working on this exact problem where he's trying to bootstrap kind of proof of state networks with specifically bitcoin security model, which I kind of think is interesting. But yeah. To try to solve the bootstrapping problem for proof of stake network or app chains or subnets.
00:46:11.420 - 00:46:31.398, Speaker B: And so, I mean, this is a major problem. Right. A lot of, a lot of projects have problems bootstrapping liquidity for network holders in their network. Right. So what do they do? They create all these crazy incentive programs, which ultimately is net benefit, net beneficial to giant quantitative trading funds and not necessarily, like the network itself.
00:46:31.454 - 00:46:32.054, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:32.222 - 00:46:47.192, Speaker B: How do you bootstrap a validator set? It's difficult, but, and again, I can't think off the top of my head the proposal that came through. But in essence, there's an opportunity, opportunity now for new application specific chains that can rely on the current cosmos validator set.
00:46:47.256 - 00:46:47.824, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:46:47.912 - 00:47:15.368, Speaker B: And those validators automatically opt in to a lot of these new chains and validate transactions on them. Will that pass? Will it work? I don't know, but to me, that's interesting. That's enough of, like, a desire to improve the application specific chain concept such that they're saying, we recognize this is a problem. Here's our proposal to solve it. Maybe it doesn't work, but at least we're working towards, towards progress. Progress Maxi comes out and finally. Right.
00:47:15.368 - 00:48:21.522, Speaker B: And I think that that's what's so compelling to me about the cosmos ecosystem is that I do think that there's opportunities for very specific types of applications that can and should probably have their own chain that comes with a huge set of trade offs. Right. One of them being bootstrapping the validator set, the other one being like, if you want to build a robust developer ecosystem on top of your app specific chain, man, that's hard. You're not getting any of the benefits of, like, Ethereum or Solana or any of these other larger chains that have these huge blossoming ecosystems. Right. So do I think Cosmos is going to be the biggest sort of l one out there? No, and it's because the system is not actually set up for the type of scale that's going to be bringing on, say, you know, the next, call it whatever, billion users into web3, Solana is probably more teed up for something like that, potentially swin Aptos, and we'll get to that in a second. But the point that I'm making is with Cosmos is the reason I'm bullish on it is a, there is a very vibrant and robust developer ecosystem.
00:48:21.522 - 00:48:44.720, Speaker B: Some of the people behind Tendermin and IBC and the work that's being done there, these are incredibly smart and just really passionate developers that want to, you know, affect change, I think, in the right way. And then three, this gets back to the pattern, right? Like, is this the actual iteration of enterprise? Blockchain is actually an application specific chain, and if that plays out, I want to have some exposure to that. Right.
00:48:44.800 - 00:48:45.576, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:48:45.728 - 00:49:09.750, Speaker B: So, with respect to Sui and Optus. Right. So first of all, the teams are lights out. Both of those teams are incredible. I was fortunate enough to meet Evan and his broader team at Mistin Labs. And, I mean, there's just, if you're not impressed by them, like, there's something wrong with you. They're incredibly talented, smart people.
00:49:09.750 - 00:49:51.804, Speaker B: There are a couple of ways of how I look at Swe and Aptos. One is through kind of like the investment lens, and the other one is through the kind of technological developer lens. So on the investment side, and again, this is not financial advice. And no, we don't have any positions or upcoming positions in any of these projects that we've been talking about. Certainly not swe or Aptos. On the investment side, I think this is, again, a pattern matching exercise. So in the previous vintage of crypto VC's in like 20 17, 20, 18, 20, 16, 17, 18.
00:49:51.804 - 00:50:13.400, Speaker B: Like the super early guys. Right. Polychain, Pantera, multicoin, a 16 z. Right. I know I'm leaving some out, but you get the picture in a lot of cases, and this is by no means am I taking anything away from these folks. Like, they were early as hell, they were convicted, like they deserve all the credit. But the big winners from that era were really l one s.
00:50:13.400 - 00:50:20.914, Speaker B: But they were l one s at $20 million pre money valuations. Right. Not two orders of magnitude larger than that.
00:50:20.962 - 00:50:21.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:21.314 - 00:50:45.128, Speaker B: Right. So back then, if you basically got into the private sale of these l one s, you probably made 10,000%. Right. Or toward, you know, some crazy multiple. Right. A lot of folks today that are launching funds or have now raised their second or third fund, they're all looking for that next l one.
00:50:45.184 - 00:50:45.648, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:45.744 - 00:50:58.264, Speaker B: And my take on it is, is that that ship has sailed. Will we have more l one? Sure. Are you going to get Solana at $20 million pre money valuation? Absolutely not. That those days are way behind us.
00:50:58.312 - 00:50:58.760, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:58.880 - 00:51:32.708, Speaker B: So instead of looking for, like, the new l one, that's a literal l one, why not look for the next iteration of what the l one from the previous vintage is in this vintage? Meaning maybe it's cross chain messaging, maybe it's bridging, maybe it's, you know, it's some other vertical or some new kind of, like, concept with respect to a multi chain world, I'm just making stuff up. The point that I'm getting at is, is that if you're looking for a repeat of something that occurred for the first time ever, which was l one's back in 1718, if you're looking for that again, it's not going to happen.
00:51:32.764 - 00:51:33.044, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:33.092 - 00:51:42.784, Speaker B: And if you. If you think it's going to happen, it's going to be at such a premium that you're gonna end up spending, you know, a $2 billion valuation on a company that's nine months old. Right.
00:51:42.872 - 00:52:22.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I do agree. I think the biggest thing that, like, l one's, I mean, the fact that we're still talking about it, I think, means, like, we're still early. I personally just want the l one to be so fast, so easy, so cheap that, and the capability to actually support 100 million users or a billion users that we no longer have to talk about it. And so I do think it's interesting that we still have to have that conversation today. I think there's a couple aspects, like the parallel processing that I think could enable that, but I don't think. Yeah, like, you're definitely not going to get the salon at, like, 20 million are the returns.
00:52:22.362 - 00:52:49.218, Speaker B: What I like about what you're saying is you're naturally gravitating towards the tech side of this. Right. Which we'll get to in a second. Through the pure investment lens, I find it very, very difficult to put our capital into a deal that could be the next l one at a valuation that's not one, but two orders of magnitude larger than the previous big l one winner. Right.
00:52:49.274 - 00:52:49.778, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:52:49.834 - 00:53:28.428, Speaker B: And so, like, just from an investment standpoint, I got to go look. I mean, the cost of capital for some of the folks that are investing in the rounds for, you know, missed in labs and aptos, their cost of capital is very different than my cost of capital. Right. And they're probably fine with the valuation, they probably don't even really care. They're probably about like just owning more tokens and asset management to some extent, right? That's just not how I view the investment space for something like these new, newer l one s. Because to be clear, there will always be more l one s. Somebody will always, this is, I mean this is like in the JavaScript world, there's always a new framework, right? Before, you know, like there's, people have built.
00:53:28.428 - 00:54:07.580, Speaker B: Before react became react, there were dozens of frameworks that people probably your age don't even know of, right? Like, so there's always going to be this desire by developers to scratch their own itch. And I can do it better, I can do it faster, I can do it cheaper. Good. That's competition for the space and it's open source, meaning everybody ends up winning long term with that. But the idea that we can now associate some economic value for a network that doesn't exist or a company that's less than a year old, I just find that very difficult. It's very hard for me from an investment standpoint. Now let's talk about like the tech developer piece, which I have a very, you know, doesn't necessarily map one to one, to the investment side.
00:54:07.580 - 00:55:45.330, Speaker B: What? Let me just kind of bifurcate a little bit here. So Aptos and Swe are different chains, but both rely on the same programming language, move. So for those of you who are not familiar with Movlang, it is a very specific type of programming language designed for assets that have effectively digital that have digital assets that have scarcity characteristics. So money, right? You don't want to be able to spend something twice, right? Those type of concepts are basically built into the program language, which is awesome, right? Because a lot of the hacks that you've seen in solidity being a Turing complete language are based on the fact that there aren't these kind of safeguards that enable developers to like not shoot themselves in the foot and have, you know, a billion dollar hack on their protocol or something, right? This is not to say that anything built with move will be bulletproof. It just means that there is a language that's been designed from the ground up to focus on quote unquote smart contract programming, or programming where assets that have scarce characteristics are actually involved. I think that's very novel, very ambitious and very innovative. The challenges, and this is where the rubber meets the road with any new programming language, not just in crypto or web3 or blockchain, is that any time you introduce a new programming language to the world, it's a zero sum game with developers.
00:55:45.330 - 00:56:53.142, Speaker B: There's roughly 27 million software developers on the planet, give or take. And that number isn't growing astronomically year over year. We may get a few hundred thousand more or something, right? Like it's, you know, for the most part it's, it's about 25 to 27 million developers. People retire, people get interested and become developers, right? There are countless number of companies that are focused on getting developers to use their tools and their programming language and their cloud infrastructure and their security tools and all of these things, right? How do you compete with that? Right? So again, this gets back to discussion earlier of it doesn't matter how amazing the technology is if no one uses it, right? And so you could have this incredibly powerful programming language move that no one uses. Why? Because people write JavaScript and rust and you know, whatever else, right, c doesn't matter, right? I'm just picking out languages. So the challenge that SWE and Aptos have on the technical side is not the technical acumen, they are gigabrains, right. Is not their ability to develop a programming language that's specific for smart contract program.
00:56:53.142 - 00:57:11.328, Speaker B: They've done that. The problem is what does your developer go to market? How do you, how do you attract and retain developers to learn a new programming language and learn a new programming model when every other company in the space is trying to get them to do this exact same thing?
00:57:11.384 - 00:57:13.152, Speaker A: Definitely. And bootstrap the community.
00:57:13.296 - 00:57:59.254, Speaker B: And bootstrap the community. Now on the one hand you could say, well, they raise a bunch of money. They can incentivize people by giving them grants and this and that. And that is true, but when you give something to someone for free, they tend to not value it as much. And so I think one of the things that you see in some of the other l two s on the EVM chains is a lot of them have these incentive programs where they've given out tons of money to developers, but like they're building stuff that like no one really uses. Well, it's because if you give something out for free, free, someone isn't like scrappy and they're not trying to like, they're not destined to ship something that's amazing. They're just like, oh, I got this grant I can like hack on this cool side project.
00:57:59.254 - 00:58:52.290, Speaker B: So I don't think, you know, dosing the community with cash is necessarily going to drive the best outcome. What I've seen work better are grassroots efforts that open source communities put into practice that attract developers, support them at where they need to be, and meet developers where they are. Right. So, for example, I think Chase Barker, who I think is either the lead or one of the top guys at Solana for the developer relations team there, he's constantly trying to get feedback from the community on, like, what's the hardest thing about learning Solana today? And he's been asking these questions, like, repeatedly for months. He asked the same question. Why? Because there's always new people that are coming on board and we have to learn how do we kind of engage with those type of people, meet them where they are such that it makes it easier for them to onboard into the ecosystem. Right.
00:58:52.290 - 00:59:41.470, Speaker B: That just that kind of subtle, nuanced question and answer of your community goes a really long way, because if you create a stack overflow community now, you've got questions and answers going. If you create a. A framework like anchor. So Armani created anchor, which is a framework that's basically, I would say almost everybody uses it now to do Solana applications. Right? Why? Because it removes a lot of the abstracted noise and security, potential security issues that come with building Solana applications. Right. So now everybody kind of hops on this anchor framework thing, right? Those types of things are way more impactful than, say, dosing the community with a ton of cash and saying, like, here's 100 grand, quit your job and build the next defi protocol on Aptos.
00:59:41.470 - 01:00:09.852, Speaker B: And again, I'm just kind of picking this randomly. So I think the long answer longer here is that from a technological and developer standpoint, the tech pieces of SWE and Aptos are amazing. Like full stop. The challenge will be the developer go to market. The challenge will be how do they actually attract and retain these developers? And by the way, there's another chain that's already doing this now. It's called Starkware. Right? They have a programming language called Cairo, which is incredible, super nerdy masturbation programming language.
01:00:09.852 - 01:00:29.352, Speaker B: It's incredible, but no one uses it. And so this is the challenge that anybody entering the space, if they make the decision to not only launch their own chain, but launch their own programming language, you have a long way to go with attracting or retaining developers to build on your platform.
01:00:29.456 - 01:00:57.246, Speaker A: Yeah, that totally makes sense. I think just on the move side as well with the programming language. I think one interesting thing is that, I mean, ultimately that could be used on other blockchains potentially. I think Solana has the ability ultimately to use, move down or in the future, if the developer ecosystem wants it or requires it, which I kind of think is interesting.
01:00:57.318 - 01:00:59.894, Speaker B: Well, I think, yeah, because you can just compile it to LLVM.
01:00:59.942 - 01:01:00.246, Speaker A: Right?
01:01:00.318 - 01:01:11.414, Speaker B: Yeah. So as long as you do that, you can use move. I mean, this is the other, this is the other interesting thing. When I talk to non technical people, they're like, oh, but it's got move. So it's going to like change the game. I'm like, guys, you could just compile.
01:01:11.462 - 01:01:12.050, Speaker A: It.
01:01:13.990 - 01:01:15.654, Speaker B: It'Ll run on a bunch of different things.
01:01:15.702 - 01:01:59.078, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, no, I do think it's interesting. The developer part is, I mean, definitely going to be a challenge, but I think it goes back to like, if it actually, if there are chains that can actually support hundreds of millions or billions of users, I do think ultimately there'll be no other choice but to adopt, like these, kind of call them like gen three blockchains. And I would put Solana in there. But it's very, yeah, you have to get not only the developers, but also the community. And I think Solana, at least today, has the highest number of monthly active users, which is interesting. Combined with like the developer ecosystem as well.
01:01:59.134 - 01:02:32.304, Speaker B: Well, let's unpack that a little bit. Right. So actually, when I talk with my investors in my fund or prospective investors, they'll ask me things about Solana versus Ethereum, or, you know, there's so much total value locked in Ethereum. Why or why are there so many more active users on Solana than Ethereum? This is a great question. This is why I think a deep technical understanding of crypto and web3 and blockchains is actually a requirement for anybody that's running a fund going forward.
01:02:32.352 - 01:02:32.880, Speaker A: I fully agree.
01:02:32.920 - 01:03:16.268, Speaker B: I mean, I am clearly biased in this. Why? Right. So let's say you're a fly by night former investment banker who now has a crypto fund, and you get a question. Why are there more daily active users on Solana than Ethereum? Well, nfts, right? Or some stupid, stupid answer that has no substance to it. Here's the actual reason. Right? So if you dig into the applications that are on Ethereum and Solana on Ethereum, developers have to optimize every single byte of code for that application to run to be as cheap as possible, right? So the developer is thinking with constraints from the very beginning. That's one aspect.
01:03:16.268 - 01:04:13.518, Speaker B: The second aspect is Ethereum applications are designed to not be interacted with frequently. Right? Why? Because it's super fucking expensive. Right? So why are there more daily active users on Solana? Well, number one, the developers that are building applications for Ethereum are optimizing at the, at the byte level. Like, how few instructions can they include in the application because it's expensive? And two, the applications are not meant to be interacted with frequently because of the expense associated with transacting on Ethereum's chain versus Solana, where there's effectively no, you know, real tax on compute units that you use inside your Solana application. And it's extremely cheap to transact with, which means people should be interacting with it very frequently. Right. That is one of that example is why I always suggest to people that, like, look, if you're going to go find interesting emerging managers to invest in the space, test their technical acumen.
01:04:13.574 - 01:04:13.782, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:13.806 - 01:04:17.294, Speaker B: Because if they don't understand something as simple as what I just outlined.
01:04:17.342 - 01:04:17.998, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:18.174 - 01:04:25.402, Speaker B: Then you're really rolling the dice with someone who's just going to get lucky to their network or nepotism or something along these lines and, like, hope is in a risk management strategy.
01:04:25.466 - 01:05:06.236, Speaker A: I fully agree. And I mean, I did a podcast with another gentleman recently, and we discussed this very topic because I kind of locked myself in a room for a year and just like, did deep dives from, like, trying to articulate the first principles. And then ultimately, I once I kind of came out of this room out of like, this year long research, I started going to these conferences and I was shocked by the amount of people that were not technical trying to explain things to me after doing all this research and, like, how little they knew and, but, like, some of them run very large funds and I, so I was, I was floored. So I totally agree.
01:05:06.388 - 01:05:41.818, Speaker B: Yeah. Look, I mean, again, like, on the one hand, there's, there's value to folks that can raise money, that can spin a narrative, that can manage a list of investors. Investors, like, like, nothing taken away from those types of folks. Right. But I don't know how beyond having, say, a pedigree or brand recognition or a team of researchers and technologists, like, how are you going to actually differentiate as a venture early stage investor in crypto in 2022-2324 if you literally don't understand the technology? Like, this is such an unbelievably technical industry.
01:05:41.954 - 01:05:42.570, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:42.690 - 01:05:54.514, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people saw what happened in the last cycle and are like, oh, all I got to do is like, get into this round and get into that round. And it's like, I don't know, it's about to get really competitive.
01:05:54.602 - 01:05:54.890, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:54.930 - 01:06:14.430, Speaker B: You don't understand what you're investing in. May up invest. Yeah, I mean, you may. Yeah, exactly. You may end up investing in something that has this wide open security hole that drains their protocol of hundreds of millions of dollars. Right. That anybody can copy paste on the Internet.
01:06:14.430 - 01:06:44.270, Speaker B: Right. Like, I'm not suggesting that a VC needs to be doing code audits, right. But there needs to be some, I would think, fundamental understanding at a technical level or have a team of folks that can support you on the technical side, because this space is evolving at such a rapid clip that in order to just keep a pulse, let alone keep up with this, requires some sort of technical acumen. And if you don't have that, I just think you're at a massive disadvantage in the space.
01:06:44.350 - 01:07:13.540, Speaker A: I fully agree. Maybe just to stick on the technical aspect a little bit longer, and then I would kind of want to pivot a little bit into asymmetric, your fund. You mentioned Cairo and the starkware. What is your kind of thoughts on L2s and kind of like the stuff that is going on in the zero knowledge space?
01:07:15.480 - 01:07:32.230, Speaker B: So, good question. I have been, no surprise, non consensus on l two s for a long time. I have this running joke where I say the reason it's called an l two is now you have two problems.
01:07:33.130 - 01:07:34.034, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
01:07:34.082 - 01:07:58.944, Speaker B: So again, this gets to kind of the pattern recognition piece here. Right. I could be wrong on this. I've been wrong many times in the past, so I could be wrong on this. But if you are designing, if you're a software architect or a, you know, a developer that's trying to design this new software, piece of software application that you want to build, there's a pattern here that I've seen in the past. No surprise. I know.
01:07:58.944 - 01:08:23.808, Speaker B: Like, Joe, this is getting old. Right? So today, if you use an l two, why do you use an l two? Because it solves the scalability issue of ethereum. Right. Like in theory. Right. But what you've done is you've introduced a completely new set of a new technical. Sorry, let me back up.
01:08:23.808 - 01:08:45.586, Speaker B: It introduces a new piece to your technical architecture that increases the entropy in your overall system exponentially. Right. So if you have one piece of technology for your architecture and you add another one. Right. It becomes more difficult. Now, the l two also has an upstream dependent dependency on the l one. Right.
01:08:45.586 - 01:09:09.388, Speaker B: A lot of cases. Because if the settlement layer actually changes, which it changes, you now have to manage that upstream dependency. As a developer, are you confident that your l two is going to be able to. Yes, like you should be able to. Right, I know. But the point is, is that now I have an upstream dependency on something that you don't have any control over. Right? Furthermore, and I think finally the user experience becomes even more difficult.
01:09:09.388 - 01:10:08.250, Speaker B: Tricky, right? How many l two s are there? Why do I have to change a network? What the fuck is a network like? Why? I don't care. I'm just a user. I want to like buy this nft, I don't care. None of it matters, right? All of those things make me bearish on l two s. I think in the immediate term there's a little more probably short term trading opportunities with l two s that is separate than my view on l two s long term. And furthermore, there is always the potential that an l one could cannibalize the need for an l one to. It's highly unlikely, but it is possible, right? And so my, the reason I say I've kind of seen this movie before or this pattern is, and again, I'm certainly dating myself, but if you go back to like maybe the, maybe 2007 eight nine timeframe, there was a rise of a new type of database called a NoSQL or no SQL database, right? And it didn't mean I no SQL, it meant not only SQL, not only simple query language.
01:10:08.250 - 01:10:58.570, Speaker B: The majority of these databases were like key value stores or document stores. It's like a new way of storing information. And they were super web two friendly and cloud friendly and all this good stuff. But what ended up happening was they're really slow when you started to get a lot of scale, right? So I think MongoDB went through a lot of pain in the early days of like, people were using Mongo and they were getting like these, like Foursquare used Mongo and Snapchat was using Mongo and like these, you know, but it was super slow and they were crashing all this kind of stuff, which, by the way, is a sign of success. I want to be super clear. Like, I'm not, you know, denigrating MongoDB whatsoever. But the point that I'm getting to is that what developers ended up doing is they were like, I need, like, this database is great, but I need it to read from memory.
01:10:58.570 - 01:11:25.212, Speaker B: I need something faster, right? And if you read from memory versus from disk, it's obviously faster. It's the fastest it can be, right? So MongoDB doesn't have an in memory store. So what do you do? You put redis in front of it, right? So now you have a L2 in front of your MongoDB instance. Why do you do that? Because you want real fast, like things that are cached. Right. You want that stuff really quickly. Redis is.
01:11:25.212 - 01:11:43.300, Speaker B: Man, it's still, to this day, like, one of the greatest databases ever built, in my opinion. But what happened eventually, a lot of these databases, and I think it's been a while since I've used Mongo, so I could be totally wrong on this, but I'm pretty sure this happened with Mongo. They just created an in memory data store in the database.
01:11:43.380 - 01:11:43.900, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:44.020 - 01:12:12.382, Speaker B: And why did they do that? Because now you no longer have to rely on Mongo and Redis. You can just rely on Mongo. So all those people that invested in this L2 redis are like, shit, I don't need this anymore. I just need Mongo, the new version of Mongo that has it in memory store. And so what I'm getting to, again, this is one of these patterns that you try to identify that, like. Like, how did Joe go from in memory data stores and NoSQL databases to L2s and settlement layers of L2?
01:12:12.406 - 01:12:13.740, Speaker A: I think it's a great example.
01:12:13.910 - 01:12:20.792, Speaker B: But this is how. Right. Because if you look at a L2, what are they solving for? Speed. You know, how quickly can something get done?
01:12:20.856 - 01:12:21.168, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:21.224 - 01:12:38.424, Speaker B: Right. Well, why are they doing that? Because this thing is slow. Right. It's better, but it's slow. Right. So again, I could be wrong about l two s. It is a fundamentally different problem set versus, like, you know, a NoSQL database and an in memory data store, but it's effectively conceptually the same thing.
01:12:38.472 - 01:12:38.744, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:38.792 - 01:12:51.584, Speaker B: And so if the l one s figure out miraculously how to become as fast as, say, your redis or in memory data store, the purpose of an l two is basically non existent.
01:12:51.672 - 01:12:55.504, Speaker A: Yeah. And you reduce complexity, overhead and user experience. Everything's better.
01:12:55.592 - 01:13:08.118, Speaker B: So this is why I have a bearish consensus view, non consensus view, longer term on l two s, because if it follows the same pattern as the in memory data store with respect to Mongo, those things are going away. Right.
01:13:08.174 - 01:13:38.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. Even, like, transaction finality. And there's a lot of things that ultimately kind of. I'm not super optimistic on the L2 front, but maybe specifically zero knowledge stuff, though. What is your. Does that bearishness in general on L2s accomplished or encompass zero knowledge, or is that like a separate component?
01:13:38.890 - 01:14:35.318, Speaker B: So admittedly, I'm not an expert on zero knowledge, but what. How I have seen, what I've seen recently with respect to zero knowledge beyond what's happening at the l two layer is actually more, I would say, more interesting, because I'm bearish on l two s, I forget the name of the company, but they're relatively early stage and they're using zero knowledge proofs for I'm going to totally butcher this. I believe they're trying to access serum order books on Solana, but bridge them to Cosmos so that any chain within cosmos can effectively leverage. Sarah Mortar Brooks I don't know how this would work. When the founder was pitching me, he was very knowledgeable about zero knowledge and how he was implementing it. So the point that I'm getting to is that it is clear that I'm not a cryptography, you know, PhD expert. It's clear that I'm not a zero knowledge expert.
01:14:35.318 - 01:14:59.668, Speaker B: What I look for, because that's, again, this is like the academic versus product engineer, right? Zero knowledge is like academic to the core. And so what I look for as more of like, a product guy is like, where's the applicability of it? So one of the reasons why I don't track zero knowledge, to the extent that I track, say, things like, you know, Solana or Cosmos more broadly, is because I need to, I need to better understand how this thing is going.
01:14:59.684 - 01:15:03.020, Speaker A: To be applied to technology, the user application.
01:15:03.140 - 01:15:27.582, Speaker B: Exactly. And so to me, the jury is still out as to whether or not these certain, the approaches of zero knowledge today will actually bring user applications to a level that are not, I would say, possible. With the current set of technologies in web3 and blockchain today.
01:15:27.646 - 01:15:28.254, Speaker A: That makes sense.
01:15:28.342 - 01:16:19.522, Speaker B: I think it's, I mean, look, like, are you going to bet against these guys and gals that are creating this? Absolutely not. But again, this is, this is, to me, it's just a very simple argument of, you could, you can create the most powerful, amazing, brilliant technology on earth, but if no one has a way to utilize it, if no one has a way to integrate it, there isn't obvious use cases for it beyond, like, we need to scale this random l one through. Like, no one even cares about that. And so I guess what I'm getting to is that I'm not trying to punt on the question. It's really, I don't track it as much because I don't see the real world applicability and I can't kind of use my pattern matching to be like, all right, what does this look like before? Because it's still so kind of obtuse and nebulous.
01:16:19.586 - 01:16:48.716, Speaker A: No, it totally makes sense. Yeah. Users, I think, have to come first and for us to kind of hit the mainstream adoption. So it totally makes sense. Maybe to pivot a little bit more, kind of learning about, like, asymmetric, why you started asymmetric, and kind of your not thesis, but just like, general overview of, like, what you're trying to do.
01:16:48.908 - 01:16:59.120, Speaker B: Sure. So everything I'm about to say is not a solicitation whatsoever. I am also not giving any financial advice whatsoever.
01:16:59.740 - 01:17:02.520, Speaker A: Obi put in the show notes, not financial advice.
01:17:03.420 - 01:17:34.144, Speaker B: Not a solicitation, not financial advice. All that good stuff. Right? So I used to run a quant and systematic trading desk at a traditional hedge fund called passport capital in San Francisco for crypto in 2018. I was very fortunate enough to work with an incredible team there. John Burbank, who's a legend in the hedge fund space, learned a lot from him, was an awesome experience. I left in 2019 not because of passport, really, just because the industry, the hedge fund industry is. It's very difficult to trade crypto, right.
01:17:34.144 - 01:18:07.530, Speaker B: Just full stop. Even in 2022, it's still pretty challenging. So I said, look, it's not you, it's me. You know, I just want to continue to kind of, like, go explore the space and do the things that I know how to do at a kind of programmatic, you know, systematic way. Also doing a lot of R and D into blockchain and blockchain adjacent technologies in the 1819, even 20 ish bear market time, because ten years prior to that, I had done R and D in 2009 in three areas of technology that I saw at the time as. As being probably pretty meaningful. The first one was cloud computing.
01:18:07.530 - 01:18:55.086, Speaker B: The second was mobile technologies, and the third was open source, particularly node js, but the open source ethos more broadly, and those three worked out really well for my technology career. And so in 2019, I decided to spend a lot more time digging into blockchain and blockchain adjacent technologies. Started building Ethereum apps, checking out the solidity language, the developer ecosystem. Ethereum landed on Solana. I got early to Solana, like, all this good stuff, right? Meanwhile, I got recruited to actually join Microsoft in the Cloud AI organization as a senior director there to help them with, like, strategy and kind of think through emerging technology stuff, which was awesome. And the way I was able to shape a lot of my points of view for Microsoft was by doing this research, but also doing a lot of angel investing, web3 and crypto. The day that I left passwords is not joke.
01:18:55.086 - 01:19:30.906, Speaker B: Actually, the day after I left passport, a friend of mine who's a very well known VC in Silicon Valley reached out to me, and he's like, it's like hey, can I give you, like, $3 million and just manage my crypto for me? And I was like, I love you, but no, right? Like, no, I don't want to run a fund. Like, I'm good. Like, you know, let the paint dry on the agreement and all that good stuff first. And this kept happening. I was flattered where a number of folks, high net worth hedge fund pec guys, were just kind of like, I don't know anything about crypto. You clearly know what's going on. Can I just give you some money? And I just kept saying no.
01:19:30.906 - 01:20:14.068, Speaker B: And then that changed in October of last year, 2021, with a very close friend of mine named Steve Jang, who I deeply admire and have a lot of respect for as an entrepreneur and investor. Right? He's prolific investors, like early money into Uber and Coinbase and Magic Eden. I mean, the list goes on. Awesome guy was like, he was trying to get me to come basically run a fund for his fund, Kindred ventures, who are talking about partnering up on, like, kindred crypto, come, like, run a fund for Kindred. And I was like, I love you, man, but if I'm gonna do something like this, I'm just gonna do my own thing, right? And he was more or less basically like, yeah, I knew you were going to say that. Like, let me help you kind of get it set up. Get off the ground, yada, yada, yada.
01:20:14.068 - 01:20:57.398, Speaker B: And I was like, all right, cool. And I was lucky enough to have Mark Andreessen and Chris Dixon want to be the first money into the fund based on Steve's conversation and recommendation. So that was, like, a pretty strong validation signal for me. And launched the concept of asymmetric in November of last year. We were operating in stealth up until May of 2022. The way that I kind of always thought about if I was to do my own fund is no surprise. It's not going to look like every other fund, right? And it's primarily because, and I alluded to this earlier, the way I kind of position the message of what acmetric actually is, is like, it's actually like a technology company with a fund mandate.
01:20:57.398 - 01:21:22.202, Speaker B: It looks. It kind of looks and smells like a technology company, but it's like, no, we're a fund. Like, to be super clear, right? And the reason that is the case is, number one, we talked about this. If you're going to make early stage investments or just even investments in general, even in the liquid market. Right. For crypto, like, you probably need to understand it at a layer of technical depth that's you know, more than just like the baseline, right?
01:21:22.226 - 01:21:22.570, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:21:22.650 - 01:22:15.826, Speaker B: So that's one aspect. And myself and the supporting team that I have, like half the companies technologists, right? They're not, you know, analysts or traders or whatever. Excuse me. So you have to have that kind of like, heavy, in my view, heavy kind of tech DNA baked into the culture from day one. But, and I think this is a huge change in traditional vc when it comes to crypto, is that not only do you have to have a technical view on how to invest in crypto and web3, you have to have to have, like, technology to manage those investments, right? And this is a huge gap that exists in crypto and web3 and venture investing and hedge funds, and you name it in crypto right now is that if you go to talk to any fund manager today, doesn't matter. They could have 10 million or 10 billion under management and they're in crypto, web3. And you say, how do you manage your portfolio? You know, they're going to tell you.
01:22:15.826 - 01:23:24.806, Speaker B: They're like, oh, man, I got like Google sheets and airtable and like, I refresh Zapper for my Ethereum wallet and I go over here to this Solana dashboard thing, and then I'm like, so you don't have a solution, right? You're just cobbling it all together. This is insane, right? You're talking about an asset class where people are making billions of dollars and they're using the most rudimentary forms of tracking and managing risk in their portfolio. To me, as a risk manager, I'm like, this is crazy. Like, I cannot manage a book of investments if I'm like, stitching together spreadsheets and air tables and telegram messages. This is nuts, right? So one of the things that we're doing that's unique at asymmetric is we're actually building a lot of this in house proprietary software for our fund. We're building it out of necessity, actually, because I've actually talked with folks at unnamed venture firms that have had a take like 60% drawdowns on their book because they just didn't know what their risk was. They were like, oh, like, we had it marked in the spreadsheet and then we didn't update it for like a month.
01:23:24.806 - 01:25:01.594, Speaker B: And then we came back and it was like, and I'm like, yeah, you can't do, that's not how. And so the question is like, well, why, Joe? Why do you need to have, like, this new way of managing risk and investments as a portfolio manager or risk manager in crypto. And the reason is, is that if you're doing early stage stuff for the first time ever, your seed stage investments publicly trade, and I think this is a huge misunderstanding that a lot of folks have, especially when they're looking at investing in venture funds or hedge funds or crypto funds, is they're like, well, it's a venture fund, so it should have a ten year lockup with two one year or one two year, excuse me, two one year extension. So twelve years, right? So a traditional venture fund is like, you give them money and within twelve years you get all your money back, plus your profit or whatever, right? Now they can, they can issue distributions, whatever. But the point is, is that you're locking your money up for a very long time, ten to twelve years. But in traditional venture, it takes five to 15 years to get an exit, right? Because, like, maybe the company gets acquired, maybe they go public, maybe a PE roll up, whatever, right? But it takes a long time. So the vent, the fund has to, to be structured in a way such that if I'm an investor, like, I have to commit to being like, all right, it's going to be ten to twelve years, something along those timeframe, right? But in crypto, these companies become public in months after launching, right? So why do you need a ten year lockup? That makes absolutely no sense, right? And furthermore, when you structure your fund such that it's a ten year lockup plus two one year extensions, you're kind of like, I don't really care if the price goes up and down.
01:25:01.594 - 01:25:49.058, Speaker B: Well, why is this a problem? Here's why. In crypto, some tokens that you will get as a private investment, you'll get your private token sale sometimes they'll never reach their all time highs again. So you, as a risk manager or investment manager or whatever you want to call it, you're just like, I don't care. I'm long for ten years, and then we'll just take our profits then. Well, what if it goes up a thousand x and then trades back, drops 99% and stays there for ten years? You just did your LP's, your investors a disservice by not actively managing your book, right? This to me, is just unacceptable. And one of the reasons why I like the analogy that I use is like, imagine if sequoia had to day trade their seed stage investments, right?
01:25:49.234 - 01:25:50.350, Speaker A: Whole new complexity.
01:25:50.450 - 01:26:24.782, Speaker B: Whole new complexity requires an entirely new skill set, an entirely new set of disciplined investment criteria for how you're going to be investing in the space, right? All of this is so new to traditional VC's because they've literally never had to manage a liquid portfolio. Well, I have, and you know, my buddy Chris, who works with me, he's been in the business nearly 20 years. He was a multi billion dollar portfolio manager at Brevin Howard Global Macro. He knows how to manage liquid portfolio. We see this as an edge. Now, granted, I'm obviously like a little bullish on my own company. I have to be.
01:26:24.782 - 01:27:15.120, Speaker B: I'm a CEO, right? But the point that I'm getting to is that if it's not asymmetric, like, funds are going to have to do this, they're going to have to have a technical lens on how they invest and have technology to manage those investments, or they're not going to have the types of outsized returns that their LP's are looking for in crypto. And the last piece that I think is critically important, and it ties these two things together, is that as more and more projects and protocols start to hit the market, those founders, they're not having difficulty raising money. Like, even in a bear market. Like, really good teams are getting funded. Like, you look at those, you know, aptos and Mistin labs deals, right? Huge amounts of money are still being deployed, even in a really terrible fundraising environment. So I have an issue raising money. What they're having issues with is finding the.
01:27:15.120 - 01:27:46.946, Speaker B: That unicorn value add investor, right? The value add investor that every founder is looking for. Like, where is this value add investor, right? As a former founder, as like, a technologist, entrepreneur, whatever. Like, there are certain things that I can help advise a lot of these folks on. Whether it's like, this is how you structure board. This is how you think about, like, you know, a dual class structure. This is like, maybe how you should think about your tokenomics or, like, there's certain things like that, but, like, that's cool. But it doesn't, you know, it's.
01:27:46.946 - 01:28:18.996, Speaker B: It's not, doesn't scale with the business, right? It's like. And it's really like, ephemeral. It's like in the early stage, then, like, you get no advice from me later on, right? So what a lot of these founders are actually looking for is, well, we need people to run infrastructure on our network. So, you know, like, we're a privacy protocol. We need people to run relayers, right? I was. I'm doing a deal now with a privacy protocol in Solana, and we were talking with them and I was, like, on the phone with them, and these guys are super smart cryptographers way smarter than me. But I asked them, I was like, you have privacy protocol.
01:28:18.996 - 01:28:33.252, Speaker B: Like, well, who's running your relayers? And they're like, you know how to run a relayer? I'm like, it's a web server. I know how to run a web server, right? And I'm like, and this web server pays me, right? Like, to run it. And they're like, oh my God. They're like, we've never had an investor ask us that question before.
01:28:33.316 - 01:28:34.004, Speaker A: That's funny.
01:28:34.092 - 01:28:51.332, Speaker B: And so again, I'm obviously talking my own book here, but like, the point is, is that we see a lot of venture investments in crypto, or like private investments in crypto. You're gonna have to start running beyond just like, oh, we bought some tokens, let's stake it. Like that's table stakes. You're gonna have to do that no matter what.
01:28:51.396 - 01:28:51.780, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:28:51.860 - 01:29:40.814, Speaker B: Now you need to run validator nodes. Now you need to run liquidation bots. Now you need to run crank bots, off chain workers, relay protocol, or relayers for privacy protocols, whatever the things are, you're going to have to do that. Now, this adds one more layer of complexity, which ties all this together. If you're running 20 liquidation bots on mango markets and ten privacy relayers on unnamed protocol, and a handful of different, maybe application specific chain nodes or whatever, I'm just making stuff up. You've actually got a portfolio of crypto native infrastructure, right? So the notion of a server now acting as an investment is very real. You have a passive income stream that's uncorrelated from your portfolio and the broader market by running servers.
01:29:40.814 - 01:30:16.564, Speaker B: This has never happened before. Right? Like, the notion of like, guys on Wall street being like servers or investments never crosses their mind. Right? That is where we're going. And so in my view, we also do this today's metric. We run infrastructure and we treat them as investments where we'll be effectively rebalancing our portfolio of crypto native infrastructure. You tie all this together, and this is one of the reasons why, again, when we say to people, we're kind of like a technology company with a fund mandate, this doesn't look like a regular fund, but in our view, this is what a fund of the future has to look like.
01:30:16.612 - 01:30:48.200, Speaker A: No, I totally agree, and I think that's beautifully put. I mean, you have to be technical because they go, a lot of these projects, protocols or Dapps go essentially not public, but have liquidity events much earlier, you have to manage that book. And then being able to also run the technical infrastructure, it totally makes sense. Maybe just to tie it up. The conversation has been wonderful. I try to end the podcast with, I've been calling it spicy takes.
01:30:49.300 - 01:30:51.036, Speaker B: What, there haven't been enough already?
01:30:51.108 - 01:31:13.392, Speaker A: No, there's been a bunch. I'm excited to clip it all and post it to Twitter. But yeah, maybe just like, just to wrap it up, kind of like one, two minutes on, like, your couple spicy takes that you think whether the market or protocol. Dapps. Yeah, general spicy takes.
01:31:13.576 - 01:31:27.816, Speaker B: Okay, so I actually, I tweeted about this the other day where most recently we had all the, like, you know, c five lenders blow up.
01:31:27.848 - 01:31:28.216, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:31:28.288 - 01:32:02.036, Speaker B: That were basically custodying assets for people. And so again, this is kind of like an early pattern that I'm trying to recognize here is that in the defi boom. 20 19 20 20 20 18 19 20 20. These companies got funded and then saw their valuations go through the roof because they were earning so much money. But then people were like, well, who are your counterparties? It's too late. Everybody blew up. But the problem was is that the end users got screwed.
01:32:02.036 - 01:32:24.988, Speaker B: And, you know, hopefully they're, they're not going to get super screwed. But, like, at the end of the day, like, the people that trusted these services to custody their assets are probably going to get. They're probably not going to get back what they think they're going to get back. Right. And so I think we know people were asking me a couple months ago about when this was going on. I said, look, like it sucks. It's a, it's certainly a black eye.
01:32:24.988 - 01:33:04.492, Speaker B: If they industry, it's probably going to lead to a lot of regulation, which is probably somewhat warranted, but it's basically making the case for self custody even stronger. So, like, that's the silver lining. Right? So I guess my, my spicy take of setting all this up is that if in 20 19 20 20 20 21 it was really these, like, DeFi centralized custody providers. Well, we're seeing a lot of that happen with NFTs right now. So I think, and maybe they don't crash and burn. Hopefully they don't like a lot of these c five style DeFi lenders, but it's the same pattern. There's a lot of these services now.
01:33:04.492 - 01:33:35.884, Speaker B: They're like, we will just, like, handle the minting for you. We will. You can just come to this website and log in with your Facebook or Twitter and, like, there's all your nfts. That's a, that's a custodied solution for nfts yeah. Right. Just like Blockfi and Celsius and Voyager involved and all these were just custody solutions for Defi, right? Put your bitcoin ethereum in there, earn interest on it, right? You don't have to manage your keys, like, none of this stuff, right? It's the same thing. And so maybe the spicy take is that that is this cycles.
01:33:35.884 - 01:34:01.170, Speaker B: Like, you probably see a lot of these companies explode in valuations because they'll have tons of users and like this and that, but all it's gonna take is one of these guys get hacked or, you know, some, it won't be the same sort of counterparty risk that you got with the lenders, but maybe there will be some other thing that, that causes like, you know, some sort of ripple to, to rip through the kind of custody to NFT space.
01:34:01.790 - 01:34:04.330, Speaker A: Self custody and private key maxi.
01:34:05.510 - 01:34:12.464, Speaker B: I mean, within reason, right? I mean the, the problem with, with. I think today with private key management is it's really fucking hard.
01:34:12.552 - 01:34:13.288, Speaker A: It does suck.
01:34:13.384 - 01:34:16.560, Speaker B: It definitely needs to evolve very technical people.
01:34:16.640 - 01:34:17.460, Speaker A: It's just.
01:34:18.200 - 01:34:58.712, Speaker B: And the way that it's communicated is like, oh, if you lose it, you're fucked forever. It's just, it's like guys, like, first of all, we shouldn't call it a wallet, we should call it something else. Like there's all these kind of branding and user experience exercises that we need to really iterate through to improve it. Do I think parking somebody else is the alternative? Probably not. Maybe there's a middle ground there, but, you know, I think there's a lot of work actually. Jump is releasing an open source wallet management custody provider that like, if it's good enough for jump, like it's probably good enough for most people. Like, we're going to be looking deeply into it.
01:34:58.712 - 01:35:16.728, Speaker B: And so I think we're getting closer to actually having improvements on the self custody side. But in the meantime, we'll probably continue to have that user experience abstracting the private key management away and you'll end up with things like your block five celsius and then that may apply to nfts going forward.
01:35:16.824 - 01:35:37.414, Speaker A: That makes sense. Awesome. Well, no, thank you. Again, I really appreciate your time. A lot of spicy takes in there. So excited for people to listen. Ultimately, the biggest thing is in what approach we also are trying to take is you have to kind of be very technically oriented.
01:35:37.414 - 01:36:15.484, Speaker A: And I think nothing that you have said is not in the view of the solely viewed from. Does the technology ultimately enable user applications and no one cares about the tech. Ultimately the tech has to enable, ultimately the onboarding, and it has to be simple, but at the end of the day, will people use it? And I think that's very much what I appreciate about you and your approach to investing in the space. And it's definitely a contrarian view, but I don't think it should be. The tech and kind of the user focus should be forefront.
01:36:15.612 - 01:36:16.020, Speaker B: Great.
01:36:16.100 - 01:36:17.960, Speaker A: Well, yeah, thank you.
01:36:18.340 - 01:36:22.882, Speaker B: Catch up with me in a few years and see how the fun's doing, and we'll let you know it worked out or nothing.
01:36:22.936 - 01:36:25.230, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you again, Joe. Really appreciate it.
01:36:25.270 - 01:36:26.950, Speaker B: My pleasure. Great to be here. Thanks.
