00:00:00.360 - 00:00:25.832, Speaker A: Is that right? Now we're in this era of two and 20 for mutual funds, and it's sort of bullshit. Like, it doesn't. It's just sort of absurd, right? You know, tether is printing. What are they? You know, over 5 billion in profits a year with 30 employees. And so there's just a lot of margin, and I think it's sort of ripe for disruption. And so we're here to sort of collapse those margins and we sort of believe that stable coins should be public goods.
00:00:25.926 - 00:00:42.044, Speaker B: Kind of came to the conclusion that if you're bullish crypto at all, you have to be bullish crypto stable coins being doing 100 x from like 160 billion to like 10 trillion ish or more. Drake, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.
00:00:42.172 - 00:00:43.372, Speaker A: Absolutely. I'm excited.
00:00:43.516 - 00:00:48.880, Speaker B: Excited to do this in person and excited to be in New York. New York's super nice in the summer.
00:00:49.300 - 00:00:57.862, Speaker A: It's a little hot. The last few months were a little better, but it's starting to get to the sort of painful temperature. I think it's. Luckily I'm in the office all day anyway, so I don't know.
00:00:57.886 - 00:01:08.534, Speaker B: But true. That's how I felt about Miami. I was like, I'm going to move to Miami. It'll be nice and I'll be inside anyways. But when I go outside, I want it to be warm and sunny.
00:01:08.582 - 00:01:25.216, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Honestly, I grew up in Florida as well. And like in. I always describe the summer in south Florida very similar to the winter in New York. You sort of run from the ac to the ac to the ac. Get to your car, crank the ac, you know, the same way you do with the heat in the winter in New York.
00:01:25.328 - 00:02:42.274, Speaker B: Well, again, thank you so much. There haven't been very many projects that I have been kind of excited about in crypto lately. I think the entire industry has kind of been stuck a little bit on infrastructure and I think kind of rightfully so, just because you need the basic infrastructure for building blocks. And then once you get to sufficient infrastructure, then you can start getting to, like, novel applications and absolutely kind of more one level up. And I think what you guys at Agora are ultimately doing is kind of the next iteration of kind of defi in my mind. And I personally started going down the stable coin rabbit hole, and I really kind of came to the conclusion that if you're bullish crypto at all, you have to be bullish crypto stable coins being doing 100 x from like 160 billion to like 10 trillion ish or more I think, obviously, as a venture fund, we have a very bullish outlook on the space. It just seemed like this is where the next frontier of bridging the tradfi markets to defi ultimately netted out.
00:02:42.274 - 00:03:02.390, Speaker B: And I again appreciate you coming on the podcast, because I would love to just dive into a little bit of your journey and how you ended up as agora, as the CTO and kind of spearheading this initiative. But maybe a good place to start off would be how you got here. What is your background? How'd you end up in this spot? Drake.
00:03:02.470 - 00:03:42.124, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, the story really probably starts in 2012. When I was in college, actually, I just decided to add another major, economics, to what I was studying. And I sort of came across bitcoin. And I don't remember how exactly, but I remember sort of immediately latching onto this or being at least fascinated by this idea that you could sort of restrict the supply side of a currency, right. I sort of was really just, for the first time, this was like peak quantitative easing, right. And so for the first time really started to understand that there was such a thing as central bank risk, right. And that could make a big difference to the value of what you're doing.
00:03:42.124 - 00:04:21.996, Speaker A: And so sort of immediately saw bitcoin as like a cool technical feat, very ambitious, and was very much stuck in this view of a central bank hedge. I was like, okay, this is clearly a unique thing that we've never seen before, but didn't really think about bitcoin again until early 2016. I was actually on a road trip to Niagara Falls and needed something to listen to. Ended up listening to a few bitcoin podcasts, was like, okay, this is really cool. And I bought some and it went up and I bought some more. And anyway, I spent the whole year thinking I was an absolutely fantastic trader, as we all do.
00:04:22.108 - 00:04:24.508, Speaker B: Don't we all the first go around?
00:04:24.684 - 00:05:12.710, Speaker A: And then I was sort of around this time, I was actually working at a small boutique private equity shop. So I was sort of deep in tradfi, but yeah, I was kind of. And at this time, I spent my entire life at that time building basically discounted cash flows and operating forecasts. And so I'm holding this asset, which has none of that. And anyway, I sort of heard about ether, mainly because we were complaining about the price of GPU's, and I was immediately fascinated by this concept of mining. Ended up building a miner, having a blast, mainly just because I wanted something to build. But at the time, I just did not believe in either I didn't understand why anyone would want what I viewed as a decentralized database.
00:05:12.710 - 00:05:47.480, Speaker A: End of 2017, though, and partially because of my journey with building a miner and dealing with firmware and stuff, I decided I wanted to do software full time. I wanted to build things. Basically, I actually left finance and went into software full time. Sold all of my bitcoin and all the ether I'd been mining, mainly because I'd already ten x'ed. So that was great. How could it possibly go higher? This was the time when. Yeah, anyway, I won't talk price history too much.
00:05:47.480 - 00:06:16.412, Speaker A: So I sold everything, went into software, and I met, actually a great friend of mine, Dennison Bertram, who at the time was evangelizing people all about crypto. And so at this point, this is the bear market, 2017. 2018 bear Market. And Denison is saying to me, basically, you have to come back to crypto. We need builders. We need builders. I had joined ADP and started what would eventually become their scaling and performance team working in their payroll product.
00:06:16.412 - 00:06:53.930, Speaker A: And there's a whole bunch of interesting stories about how ADP works. But anyway, around 2019, Denison came to me and said, listen, I did a proof of concept I posted to YouTube of this thing I want to build, and some VC's want to give me money. Come and build it with me. So I said, sure, let's do it. We spent the next call, it was Christmas. We spent the next three months basically pair programming nonstop, and we built what would become Dapp hero. So Dap Hero was a sort of no code ethers j's.
00:06:53.930 - 00:07:22.658, Speaker A: So basically a tool for incorporating things like logging in with Ethereum or basically building your backend in Ethereum. So this was for people that have been in crypto a long time. This is when we were still talking about microtransactions and building all of chess games on chain and all this stuff. And gas was super cheap. This was before Defi Summer. Anyway, we coded for three months straight. We launched at ETH Denver in 2020, or maybe it's 2020.
00:07:22.658 - 00:07:24.474, Speaker A: That was right before COVID right?
00:07:24.642 - 00:07:25.082, Speaker B: Yes.
00:07:25.146 - 00:07:41.378, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so it would have been 2020. And we did a big tour. We did East London and then Ecc. Anyway, Covid hit also defi summer hit. Right? So we were in the middle of, like, raising another round. Everything kind of paused.
00:07:41.378 - 00:07:59.476, Speaker A: I mean, the whole world paused. Right. But then especially what happened was gas prices went through the roof. And so a lot of the use cases we had sort of anticipated people using Dapp hero to incorporate blockchain. Just didn't make sense anymore, right? And there were no l two s. There was no, like, there were no high throughput blockchains. Right.
00:07:59.476 - 00:08:27.420, Speaker A: This was just what we had. And so Dennison really wanted to pivot to Daos. I was less enthusiastic about that, so I stepped back. Denison took Dapphero onto to become Tally XYZ, the sort of governance folks. And obviously he was right. And that's actually a theme in mine and his relationship that he's usually right. But at that point, I was 100% kind of like, knew I wanted to be in crypto, and I thought that I would wait till the bull market ended.
00:08:27.420 - 00:09:02.250, Speaker A: Then it didn't seem like it was going to end. So I quit Adp and went to work at Frax. And so for the last few years, have been working at Fracs, basically working on all the smart contract development and just living in the world of stablecoins for the last few years. And to be honest, there's probably not a better team who knows more about stablecoin mechanics, especially sort of like the on chain mechanics, than the FRAC team. And so it was like, probably the greatest education I could have ever asked for. That team is great. And then last summer, well, actually, I guess I should go back a little bit.
00:09:02.250 - 00:09:37.302, Speaker A: In 2020, I was speaking at an event, a sort of off mainnet event, and I met Austin Campbell, who is the stablecoin guru. If the Frax team knows more about on chain stablecoins than anyone else, I think Austin knows more about fiat coins than anyone else. He was the chief risk officer at Paxos. He worked at JPMorgan for a number of years, teaches at Columbia. Anyway, we met, became really good friends. Obviously, we're sort of stablecoin people, and there's not that many of us. And last summer, he came to me and said, listen, I want you to come and meet this, this guy Nick.
00:09:37.302 - 00:10:08.720, Speaker A: He's starting to stablecoin, and I want you to basically join. So that's how I met Nick. We spent a few months kind of doing founder dating. I had been part of a lot of startups and pretty opinionated about how to build an organization and what that means. And so I wanted to make sure we were aligned on that front. And, yeah, we were. I got married I in July, and in October, we quit our jobs and started raising.
00:10:08.720 - 00:10:15.628, Speaker A: So we raised. It was only like a few weeks. And then, yeah, we've just been hiring, building since.
00:10:15.724 - 00:10:16.244, Speaker B: That's amazing.
00:10:16.292 - 00:10:17.320, Speaker A: That's sort of the story.
00:10:17.700 - 00:11:32.070, Speaker B: It's a great background, context, and I always say that it is hard to make those jumps, going from the traditional kind of like buy side to engineering to crypto to a startup. In hindsight, they're always kind of like easy decisions if you're successful, if you're not successful, everybody's like, I fucking told you. But looking back, those decisions are not easy. They're often very hard. And I always find it impressive, the people that I speak with, just the different journeys or the different paths that they take along their journeys, because it is difficult. And I think all that kind of wisdom that you kind of picked up throughout ultimately led you to agora and white, you are doing today. Can you talk about some of those early conversations with Nick and the founding team about why do a stable coin? Because today there are a couple prominent stablecoins in the industry, most notably in the US, Circle and USCC, and then tether abroad, even though they're maybe not as reputable as circle in the US.
00:11:32.070 - 00:11:38.076, Speaker B: But why did you feel like there is potentially a path for a new emergent in the market?
00:11:38.188 - 00:12:10.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think that the answer to that is a bit multifaceted. Right. But to a certain extent, this, you know, I believe this industry is going to ten x, 100 x over the next ten years. Right? Ten x over the next 5100 x over the next ten, let's say. And so the truth is, there's a big pie. And that's sort of one thing I picked up from fracs, is like, sort of this sort of, you know, everything doesn't have to be zero sum that, like, you know, we can grow the pie together kind of thing. And so I think, like, that's sort of, in my case, my mind, like the base case, right? Or like the downside case, like, worst case scenario, end up as a small player and like a humongous market.
00:12:10.842 - 00:12:43.168, Speaker A: Okay, great. But then I think also, you know, if you look at what's happening with circle and tether, right, I think they both have quite a bit of baggage in terms of the way they position themselves across a few. A few ways. So, you know, tether obviously has some. Some reputation around being opaque, and that's fine for some people, right? And then USDC has a reputation. Well, they've had the dpeg, at least. And I think they have some other issues, maybe.
00:12:43.168 - 00:12:54.762, Speaker A: And so I think there was sort of. I always viewed this as very ripe for disruption. Also, let's not forget that they're operating a business where they're taking 100% of a 5% spread. That's sort of absurd.
00:12:54.906 - 00:13:13.306, Speaker B: I mean, I don't think most people are probably as deep into the stablecoin markets as you. So can you kind of talk about stable coins from the business aspect and how tether and circle are actually probably one of the most cash printing machines within crypto?
00:13:13.378 - 00:13:51.504, Speaker A: Sure, sure. So I think, like, to really understand that, you have to take one step back and just think about double entry accounting, right? So you have assets, you have liabilities, and if you're a bank, and that's what stablecoin issuers are very similar to. Right, in terms of an accounting. So a bank has liabilities, which is like everybody's deposits in the bank, and then they have assets, right. And so when you give them $100, they have $100 of assets, and they have the $100 of liabilities, which is like the IOU for your money back. And so I think, keeping that in mind, banks ultimately, commercial banks, ultimately take that cash and they swap it for different assets. So they may take $100, they'll loan it to you.
00:13:51.504 - 00:14:31.700, Speaker A: Now, their balance sheet says they have $100 of assets, which are mortgages, and $100 of liabilities. And then they make the spread. They give you 15 basis points and they charge the mortgage folks 5%, so 500 basis points, and that's the spread. Stablecoins operate in a very similar way where they basically take in dollars or some type of asset and they issue a liability. In this case, it's the token. And then they take those assets and they try to produce more than 0%. Typically, what we've seen is people largely put those things into.
00:14:31.700 - 00:14:45.192, Speaker A: Well, if you're smart, you always denominate the assets in the same currency. So you would never swap an asset that's denominated in ether for a dollar. Stablecoin, it's a very dangerous game, and you have to overcollateralize. And there's a whole bunch of.
00:14:45.296 - 00:14:46.896, Speaker B: We've seen that game play out a couple times.
00:14:46.928 - 00:15:09.830, Speaker A: Yeah. And there are clever mechanisms, and if you look at tether, they do hold a little bit of gold in bitcoin, but it's like a few percentage points of their total liabilities. But what ultimately happens is people take those for simplicity's sake. We'll say they put them into treasuries, short dated treasuries. Right now, that's roughly four to 5%. And that's where they make their money. So that's how the business operates.
00:15:09.830 - 00:15:55.138, Speaker A: And then the quality of those assets is sort of based around liquidity. So how fast can you turn them back into dollars. And then how much? What's the risk of price volatility there? And then the last kind of piece is the amount of money you make on it, right? And so if you think about something like a mortgage as an example, there's a possibility it goes to zero, right? Someone defaults, the house blows up, I don't know, whatever. So you have to think about counterparty risk. You have to think about a risk adjusted yield, all this stuff. But ultimately, I very much view this as an asset management business. And in the same way that in the eighties mutual funds were getting two in 20, today they're taking 0.05%.
00:15:55.138 - 00:16:37.330, Speaker A: As an ETF, it's essentially the same product. I think our view is that right now we're in this era of two and 20 for mutual funds, and it's sort of bullshit. It's just sort of absurd, right? Tether is printing, what are they? Over 5 billion in profits a year with 30 employees. And so there's just a lot of margin, and I think it's sort of ripe for disruption. And so we're here to sort of collapse those margins. And we sort of believe that stable coins should be public goods, that, yeah, we just believe that this shouldn't exist in the way it does. It shouldn't be as a big of a money printing machine, and it should be much closer to a public good.
00:16:37.710 - 00:16:55.638, Speaker B: So maybe breaking that apart a little bit, how do you guys ultimately, say, agora start to achieve some success? You guys enter into the stablecoin race. What does collapsing those margins ultimately look like?
00:16:55.694 - 00:17:29.146, Speaker A: Yeah, one thing I didn't mention, which is important, is the barriers to entry to this market. It's extremely difficult. There's an extremely difficult cold start problem in terms of just pure assets. Where are you going to get the first billion, basically is sort of the question. And that's a lot of money. And so that's one piece of it. And then there's also a regulatory and access to the banking system, which I would argue is probably the most difficult part of operating a stable coin, is sufficient access to dollar liquidity from banks.
00:17:29.146 - 00:18:06.314, Speaker A: And it's incredibly difficult to move large amounts of money 24/7 so a lot of people don't realize, they think like, oh, I can send a wire transfer on the weekend. What's actually happening is the banks are just like, listen, I know you're good for the money. No worries. If you try to wire transfer a billion dollars, you have to wait till Monday. There's just like, no way you can't move money at scale. And so I think for us, that's another big piece, is like, can we get through these barriers to entry? Because once you're there, I think the margins allow you to disrupt. And I think we're very lucky that we have a number of very good partners.
00:18:06.314 - 00:18:45.932, Speaker A: And from the very beginning, we had really good advice from lawyers from Austin on how to make regulators happy, how to make bankers happy, and how to get access to the financial system. Because I think post FTX, post SVB, the Federal Reserve is very, very worried about, well, the entire banking system to a certain extent, but also most banks are pretty chilled around crypto companies. And so we've been really lucky that we have the right people, the right connections, and have been able to navigate that and get really good bank accounts and access to banks. So I think that's the final piece, which I didn't mention before. You have to remind me what I was supposed to be answering, though.
00:18:46.076 - 00:19:30.658, Speaker B: I think that's a good point as well, because when Circle had its depegging event, it was with SBV. Ultimately, people were worried about if the bank did go under, potentially the stablecoin not being backed one to one. So those banking partners are extremely important because unfortunately, the entire world does not run on crypto worlds rails one day, hopefully one day, but today that's not the case. And so those dollars need to be stored in a digital or physical bank account somewhere in the world. Hopefully, with a reputable bank, that kind of can secure that, and not a.
00:19:30.674 - 00:20:06.314, Speaker A: Regional bank, that's not an SIB. No, I think that's right. And this is actually a really important lesson, right, that what happened to circle to a certain extent, is they only had access, I think they had, at that time, 40 billion outstanding. They only had access to maybe three or 4 billion over the weekend, because not every bank operates a 24/7 ledger. And it's interesting, because I spoke about counterparties earlier in sort of the asset side of this. And one thing that I think circle didn't fully anticipate or, sorry, it's easy to be hindsight 2020, right? Obviously.
00:20:06.402 - 00:20:23.690, Speaker B: No, but what happened, I think that also, though, is beneficial. I mean, always the first person, whether it's bitcoin, ethereum, you see what works, what doesn't work. BlackBerry, MySpace. You should take lessons from the people that have kind of walked the path before you.
00:20:24.550 - 00:20:58.886, Speaker A: A very good point. And part of what I also believe is, like, we get to learn from the mistakes that circle and tether have made. Part of the mistake that circle made was listing every single custodian of all their assets. Right. Had they. I don't think that going the full tether route was the right way to do things. But had they said attestations that said, hey, we hold these assets and these types of banks, these quality of banks, although I don't know if FCB was high quality, but they wouldn't have had this issue by the end of the weekend, the whole thing was resolved.
00:20:58.886 - 00:21:30.230, Speaker A: The fed stepped in to backstop SVB. They would have never had an issue. Part of the reason they had this bank run was because they were so transparent. There's a little bit of a lesson in there that when you're dealing with the legacy financial system, which is essentially fractional reserve, and I would argue that to a certain extent, you're a fractional reserve as a stablecoin issuer, too, too much transparency will be a problem. And there's a reason why banks don't give you minute by minute views of their balance sheet. And so there are a lot of lessons to be learned from that.
00:21:31.930 - 00:21:51.216, Speaker B: I think from that. Does Agora plan to do anything interesting there? I know on the exchange side, people are doing ZK proofs of kind of like reserves and the balance sheet. Is agora kind of approaching that from a unique standpoint or lessons learned there?
00:21:51.248 - 00:22:10.940, Speaker A: Probably not unique. I mean, so we're basically like the way. Well, there's a few things, I'll just say. So the number one thing is like, I think the best counterparty, if it's dollars, is the us government. Right? So us government debt is much better than having dollars sitting at SAP. Right. You know, if the us government defaults on their debt, you've got a much bigger issue.
00:22:10.940 - 00:22:30.836, Speaker A: So I think part of it is just having good access to revolving lines of credit in terms of cash over the weekend. There's a big thing about overnight reverse repos in terms of getting access to cash quickly so you don't have to rely on just bank deposits. But. Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
00:22:30.908 - 00:22:38.380, Speaker B: What were you ultimately unique things on Agora? Oh, the attestation about technical side.
00:22:38.500 - 00:23:12.488, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll be providing. So, yeah, so I was starting to say Vaneck is managing our treasury fund. So ultimately we take assets, we put them in a short data treasury fund that consists of overnight repos, essentially targeting the IORB rate. And Vaneck's managing that fund. State street is the custodian. And so we'll provide daily attestations, or we'll receive, I should say, daily attestations of all those assets. And on top of that, we're going to be working with Chainlink to provide a data feed about essentially proof of reserves that will basically be.
00:23:12.488 - 00:23:52.480, Speaker A: Look, we have these assets at globally systemically important banks, and it matches up to total liabilities, and we'll have that attested to daily. Also, we're working with top tier auditors. PwC is going to audit the fund, and we'll have audits of our work as well. We're launching out of the BVI, but we've always held the view that we should hold ourselves to essentially the highest standard around regulatory compliance. Kyc, Aml, just because that's how you run a good business. We're not here to do this regulatory arbitrage stuff. The reason we launched at the BVI was because, quite frankly, there's not a lot of regulators who really know what they're talking about.
00:23:52.480 - 00:24:20.116, Speaker A: And if you look at some of the bills coming out of Congress, they're sort of 90% there. The problem is we haven't seen any really good regulators who really know what, what they're talking about, and also who can move quickly. Bermuda is probably the closest at this point, but it takes 18 months to get a license, and so we're launching VDI, and then we'll probably move to a jurisdiction where we will be regulated.
00:24:20.268 - 00:25:11.400, Speaker B: Nice. I think this is all good background context, both on yourself, your journey to Agora. Also, more broadly, the stablecoin markets, how much money generally they can make, which is in the billions with the yield, but also just some of the early lessons that tether and circle have provided to the team. But I think where I got really interested was part of that, as you mentioned earlier, was today, the stablecoin issuers circle and tethere keep all that yield. They're not sharing that yield, which I think potentially, well, is a lot of alpha in, because if you show me the incentive, I can kind of show you the outcome, so to speak.
00:25:11.440 - 00:25:11.688, Speaker A: Sure.
00:25:11.744 - 00:25:34.890, Speaker B: And there's a huge opportunity in my mind to kind of be defi native, integrate into all these different blockchains, work with vendors. Can you kind of talk about how agora is approaching that? Because I think you guys are really approaching that from a differentiated point of view than everybody else.
00:25:35.190 - 00:26:36.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the first thing is just like, we've got a team of crypto natives, right? Like, you look at tether and you look at circle, and it's just, you look at who owns those companies, who works there, and it's just not crypto people. And I think, so that's one thing that I think is a really big advantage for us, but the other thing is that we just believe that stablecoins should be closer to a public good, and it may not be possible to truly make them a public good. From a regulatory perspective, or even, I would argue it's not even so much regulatory, it's access to the banking system. You have to keep the bankers happy. But what we do at Agora is basically we pay out all of that yield to all of our revenue to service providers. So there's been a lot of talk over the last ten years about multi sided marketplace or double sided marketplaces, so things like Uber, where it's just a connector for drivers and users. And I think about stablecoins as a multisited marketplace.
00:26:36.584 - 00:27:34.812, Speaker A: You have a whole host of participants who both provide value and take value. Exchanges, liquidity providers, use cases, merchants, all this stuff, all these people provide value, and they also get value. Our view is that, look, we didn't do anything to earn this money. It belongs in the hands of the people who are providing services in furtherance of that network of multisited network. What we basically do at Agora is we pay out as much of our revenue as possible back to people who are providing value to the network. Exchanges for providing services, liquidity providers, dapps merchants who accept, like anybody who's running a business that's providing value to the, I call it the digital money network. We pay them for those services, and our goal is to pay out as much of our revenue as possible from the stable coin.
00:27:34.812 - 00:27:51.830, Speaker A: And we sort of believe that the margins should be much smaller than they are right now. They're 100% for stablecoin issuers, and they should be much smaller, just like asset management. You don't need to be paying outrageous fees for a mutual fund. You should just use an ETF. And so we want to be the ETF of stable coins.
00:27:52.330 - 00:27:59.770, Speaker B: I think it makes a lot of sense. It's strange to me that both tether and circle have not done this thus far.
00:27:59.850 - 00:28:26.570, Speaker A: But, you know, it's. Yeah, I think it's a little bit of, you know, they're in a dominant market position, right, let's be clear. And they're operating in an industry that's extremely hard to break into. And I mentioned this before, there's big barriers to entry. You've got big cold start problems and not on the scale of hundreds of millions. And you've got regulatory and banking kind of like those types of barriers to entry. And so I think they've just exploited that.
00:28:26.570 - 00:28:56.778, Speaker A: And we hear a lot of chatter in the market about people being pretty pissed about it. But circle and tethere don't care. I don't know if it's a mix of hubris or what, but I agree. I think it is interesting. I think they've done some experiments. If you look at with Maker, if they take their USDC and they put it into Coinbase prime, they earn some amount of yield. I think Paxos has similar in PyUSD, but they haven't been able to break in for whatever reason.
00:28:56.778 - 00:29:26.794, Speaker A: I think circle sees that and they say, yeah, we don't need to pay because you need us more than we need you, which is, I would argue, a terrible way to run a business. I actually, sometimes. When Alexander the Great was conquering Persia, part of what made it possible was that the persian empire had been mistreating the Egyptians for so long. So when Alexander the Great came, they basically were like, yeah, come have Egypt. We hate the Persians. They're assholes. And I feel like that's a little bit what's happening.
00:29:26.794 - 00:29:35.530, Speaker A: Our experience with, like, as we go to the market, it's amazing the amount of built up bad blood people have with some of the stablecoin issuers.
00:29:35.650 - 00:29:44.698, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, I feel like, I mean, the kind of famous Jeff Bezos saying was always, your margin was my opportunity.
00:29:44.754 - 00:29:45.858, Speaker A: And we say that all the time.
00:29:45.914 - 00:29:58.998, Speaker B: Really focusing on that customer experience where I think there is right now, just where we are with macro, a lot of kind of yield, the customer experience.
00:29:59.054 - 00:30:28.172, Speaker A: Is actually a huge thing that we believe too, is like our sort of pledge is like, we will never compete with our customers. We're never going to vertically integrate. We remain neutral, we treat everyone the same. If you're an exchange, an exchange, an exchange, you get the same deal. If you're a liquidity provider, it's like our view is you have to remain neutral. You want to build an app store, let anyone come and not be worried that one day you're going to be supporting their biggest competitor, which is what's happening with circle right now. Right?
00:30:28.276 - 00:30:57.658, Speaker B: Yeah. So you guys, I feel like, are emerging into probably the mainstream, but for people that are probably not following stablecoins as closely as we are, when are you guys actually going to go live? When's the plan to. Where are you guys going to launch eth l two s, different ecosystems? How are you guys kind of thinking about the market as you begin to roll out?
00:30:57.714 - 00:31:00.490, Speaker A: Yeah, so we actually just deployed to mainnet yesterday.
00:31:00.570 - 00:31:01.194, Speaker B: Congrats.
00:31:01.322 - 00:31:33.022, Speaker A: Thank you. And we have about 35 million of mints, I think, either minted or pending at the moment, waiting for wires to clear. And we sort of expect that to be a few hundred million in the next few weeks. So we're doing sort of a private beta just to build up some aum from committed partners. And then, you know, our process is we want to be multi chain. We're going to be launching on avalanche, on Sui, on mantle to start. But yeah.
00:31:33.022 - 00:32:17.966, Speaker A: So for the next, call it six weeks, we're in a private beta phase where we're accumulating TVL and where we're reaching out and getting all of our centralized exchange partners ready to go, getting market makers ready to go, getting on chain liquidity providers ready to go. We're working closely with Chainlink to get oracles up. And so the idea being we have all the infrastructure in place, a few hundred million of TbL and that's when we flip the switch for sort of the public beta. Right. Then we deploy all the liquidity on chain, we turn on the centralized exchanges and you hit the market. I think a big thing that we believe is that you need to have the full gamut of features to be competitive. And in the beginning, this cold start problem, you have to pay for that cold start.
00:32:17.966 - 00:32:46.300, Speaker A: And so you don't want to be in a situation which some other stable coins that have launched have come into where they launch and they only have one use case, they're only on one dapp, they're only in one exchange and it kind of becomes this anemic launch and no one, you can't. That doesn't work right. Like this is money. People don't have a lot of tolerance for an inferior product. They need it to be available where they're at. They need it to be useful where they're at. And so you have to kind of flip the switch with everything in place.
00:32:46.300 - 00:33:12.312, Speaker A: You can't do this kind of like bootstrap one step at a time. When you're going up against $100 billion incumbents, I think that works for the first mover. It's funny, a lot of people try and they take the playbook of Dai and they think they're just going to replicate it and it's like, no, that only worked because die was the first one. And so I think for us that's sort of the go to market strategy. But yeah, were really excited I guess.
00:33:12.456 - 00:33:35.608, Speaker B: Kind of continuing off that point. Has it been that other stable coins that have tried to come into the market to break the duopoly? Between tether and circle, has it been lack of liquidity only focused on certain chains not having feature parity? What do you think have been the biggest mistakes? Not only will learning depends on which.
00:33:35.624 - 00:33:37.232, Speaker A: Stable coin youre talking about, I would.
00:33:37.256 - 00:33:59.260, Speaker B: Say more broadly, I think there's probably a reason, whether it's the banking partners, whether it's the Aum, the liquidity, obviously there's some good and bad lessons to be taken from tether and circle, but for the people that haven't probably enjoyed the level of scale that those two have, why do you feel like they have not?
00:34:01.520 - 00:34:38.642, Speaker A: I think it's. There's a lot to unpack there probably. I think part of it was a fundamental misunderstanding of what drives user behavior to a certain extent. And the switching costs are low and these are interchangeable products, so you have to really have a reason for people to switch. And I think circle was lucky because tether had all these, this tether fud for years. So they were like, look, we're the no fud version of this. So they kind of have their niche.
00:34:38.642 - 00:35:21.538, Speaker A: But if you look at something like USDP or PYUSD, why are users going to move? And I think they're going to have potentially less liquidity, less use cases. I think those companies also deal with branding issues potentially. So I would say it's a combination of not having a compelling reason for people to switch, not really understanding how liquidity works on chain. I think that's something that seems really simple and is not. And you've seen this happen with lots of stable coins, just like not being able to develop deep liquidity. And then I think it's also just potentially brand reputation. I think that's a little bit of what PayPal has to deal with.
00:35:21.538 - 00:35:55.670, Speaker A: And there have been successful products. If you look at Busdheen or FD, USD even is several billion. And it's interesting because you see both of those were driven by binance. I think you can see, well, why were users using this? Well, they wanted access to binance and that's how you got access. I think it's, yeah, it's not being resourced enough to overcome the cold start, and it's sort of a misunderstanding of user behavior to a certain extent too. So hopefully we're successful or else I'm going to look like a big fool.
00:35:55.750 - 00:36:21.606, Speaker B: No, no, I think, I mean, studying from history is just as important of what worked versus what didn't work. And I think it's important to know those nuances from. Perhaps you mentioned the liquidity piece can you talk about the liquidity piece and how that can potentially be a challenge for others and how you guys are kind of approaching it.
00:36:21.678 - 00:36:54.368, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think this is kind of, I'm going to use go as an example here, and I hate to pick on them, but it's sort of a perfect example of misunderstanding how markets work. And I see this a lot. I end up, people always, they think I'm like an angel investor and I don't do any of that. But they send me these pitch decks and they want to launch a debt collateralized stablecoin, very similar to the very early version of Dai. And they're like, yeah, and you can loop it and you can do this. And they never answer the question of like, but who's going to buy it? Okay, so you have someone who wants a long eth.
00:36:54.368 - 00:37:03.544, Speaker A: Fine. They mint your stablecoin, they sell it for more eth. Right? Like, you know that. Right? And they don't always, and they buy more eth. Right. So now they've leveraged long eth. Right.
00:37:03.544 - 00:37:37.266, Speaker A: Well, who are those people that are buying it? Right. And I think this is an interesting. If you, you know, you talked about history. If you look at Dai, Dai sort of had this problem, but on the opposite side, where they actually had more demand than there was long for ETH. And so that's why they introduced the PSM. Well, go launched without any PSM, without any deep liquidity, but also in an environment where people were getting paid to hold stable coins, SDAI was yielding, I don't know, at this point, like 8% s frax was yielding double digits. You can't launch a deadback stablecoin.
00:37:37.266 - 00:38:19.104, Speaker A: There's no reason for people to hold it. And you don't have essentially a PSM, which can take a variety of forms. The PSM is the classic version that maker has Frax does what I believe is a better version, which is essentially just deepen on chain liquidity and stable swap on curve. But yeah, I think that's a big piece of something that I see people make a mistake all the time is just fundamentally misunderstanding what drives user behavior around liquidity. So you have to have an equal number of sellers and buyers, or else you have a deep. And that either it collapses your market share or you de peg, which is arguably worse. And then I think it's also just like misunderstanding user behavior around volume.
00:38:19.104 - 00:38:53.582, Speaker A: So it's sort of a chicken and egg problem. Right. You need to have users trading to provide the volume for liquidity providers to make enough money to provide liquidity. But if you don't have liquidity, users won't use you. And if you don't have access on centralized exchanges, let's say, or if you don't have access to, like, lots of use cases on dapps, no one's trading you. And you kind of get in this, like, conundrum where market makers don't want to market make LP's, don't want to provide LP because there's no volume, so they don't make enough money to overcome the impermanent loss. And so I think for us, that's a big part of why we believe you need to have the whole suite to launch.
00:38:53.582 - 00:39:04.342, Speaker A: And also, look, let's be honest, you have to pay people to buy liquidity in the beginning, especially. And so I think that's probably what I would say about liquidity. And then also, oh, go ahead.
00:39:04.406 - 00:39:23.882, Speaker B: For the people that aren't as deep. Why do you have to pay for liquidity if you have all these fancy baking partners? They're all backed one to one, or they're all in treasuries, why can't someone just say, hey, I'm going to send my agora to the redemption window, and they redeem and I can ultimately get my cash out?
00:39:24.026 - 00:39:40.762, Speaker A: Well, I guess they can to a certain extent, but the banking system's slow, right? I mean, that's, you're looking at, like, t plus one or more, which sucks. And I think most people don't want liquidity in and out of fiat nearly as much as they want liquidity on.
00:39:40.786 - 00:39:44.834, Speaker B: Chain and USDC to Agora.
00:39:45.002 - 00:40:23.780, Speaker A: Yeah, USDC. I mean, or like, you know, if you look at, like the most important liquidity pool, arguably on Mainnet, it's the ETH stable, which is today ETH USDC, and one day it will be ETH AUSD. But there's a very, if you look at the landscape of LP's on chain and where the trading takes place, you kind of have you got, like, volatile pools, which are usually paired against ETH because they have less than permanent loss that way. But people want to swap from volatile to stable. And so what ends up happening is it goes from volatile token X to eTH to USDC, and you have to win that eTh USDC pool. Otherwise there's just no point. You're just paying more money to now go from USDC to USDT or whatever it is.
00:40:23.780 - 00:41:01.252, Speaker A: So I think that's a big part. And then there's also the off chain liquidity on centralized exchanges, and that's a little bit easier, because obviously a clob is much more efficient than an amm. But I think you have to pay. Sorry, to get back to your original question, you have to pay people because it's not profitable to provide LP, especially on chain, unless there's a lot of volume. You basically think of it as people that are providing liquidity are always on the losing side of the trade. They're always the ones left holding the bag. And so they only make money when the volume and the fees make up for that.
00:41:01.252 - 00:41:12.362, Speaker A: Or there's not a lot of net price movements. But ultimately, I think the biggest driver here is volume and flow, and that's how you make money as a market maker, is the volume, not just by leaving your money there.
00:41:12.436 - 00:41:16.038, Speaker B: So, makes sense. Have to have lots of volumes.
00:41:16.174 - 00:41:40.532, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And that's like. And that's sort of. Yeah, it's one of these, like classic Cache 22. It's why the cold start problem is so difficult, is that users will not use you if they are worried about liquidity. And you see this with USDy, and I think to a certain extent, USDM, where you know, you're great, you made 5% over the year, but you ate 3% in slippage, because when you needed to get out, there was no liquidity. That's just absurd.
00:41:40.532 - 00:42:06.340, Speaker A: That's unacceptable. And so I think people, yeah, you have to have deep liquidity. You have to. And I think on chain, liquidity is especially powerful because you can see it and you can look and say, okay, I have 10 million AUSD, I want to swap that right now for ETh. What's the price impact? Right. As opposed to a centralized exchange where you probably get better execution, but you don't really know how deep the order book is. And I think, yeah, people are incredibly risk averse with stablecoins.
00:42:06.340 - 00:42:07.956, Speaker A: Right. Stablecoins are a fleet of safety.
00:42:08.028 - 00:42:09.164, Speaker B: You want them to be Borg.
00:42:09.252 - 00:42:20.180, Speaker A: Yeah. And if they're nothing, there's a chance that they're deep to $0.96 on a regular basis. Like what happened to go. It's a hard sell to hold that when you could just hold USCC.
00:42:20.480 - 00:42:52.202, Speaker B: Maybe if we can shift a little bit, I think, and tell me to move on to another topic, because I know we're more engineering focused, but I think it's been interesting now, just some of the calls for the US to be at the forefront of stablecoin markets, to have someone buy treasuries. I don't know if you've thought too much about that or can explain any of that, but I think it potentially could be interesting to the.
00:42:52.226 - 00:42:56.590, Speaker A: So you mean just kind of like how stablecoins maybe play into the next ten years of us foreign policy?
00:42:56.970 - 00:43:06.996, Speaker B: Not sure, maybe like foreign policy, so to speak. But just how stablecoins can kind of like be net beneficial for the US more broadly.
00:43:07.188 - 00:43:52.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think this is like an incredibly important thing to talk about. And I think you're seeing more people start to come around. There's been great work by people educating Congress, people like Austin. And we saw Paul Ryan recently talk about this, actually stablecoins as an avenue for excessive us debt. I think they're incredibly useful for the United States. Look, whatever you want to say about the United States and globalization and dollarization of the world, I think from a purely us perspective, dollars in the hands of people around the world is an incredibly powerful tool. One, because it props up the price of the dollar, two, because it increases the influence of the dollar, and three, because it basically establishes us as the reserve currency.
00:43:52.520 - 00:44:47.638, Speaker A: I think stablecoins are actually an incredibly big upgrade for the US in terms of getting dollars into the hands of more people, especially in areas that don't have maybe the greatest relationships with the US or they don't have the financial infrastructure. So in many, many countries, in Africa, Latin America, Asia, you have a big market for greenbacks, which is essentially dollar bills. And the reason is because you can't access us dollar bank accounts in these countries because of capital controls. But people don't want maybe the currency that they're dealing with today because it's inflationary or anything else, or the fiscal policy has been mismanaged, et cetera. Right now you have this huge market for cash, which is impossible to keep track of. It enables more crime. All of these things.
00:44:47.638 - 00:45:47.710, Speaker A: Stablecoins are just a wholesale upgrade, not only for the users, legitimate users in these countries who want to avoid inflation, but don't want to have $1,000 under their mattress, they can have a stable coin. And then also it's great because as this replaces cash in criminal enterprises, the ability for law enforcement to stop that activity is so much higher than it is with people just using cash all across the globe. And so you kind of get all the benefit with none of the downside. You get to help the people who are most in need of help across the globe by giving them access to dollars that they can own themselves, that they don't have to stick under a mattress, that they don't have to worry about being robbed. And you give the ability to stop Hamas or whatever terrorist group that may be using this money. The second that you find out where they are or who they are, you have an incredible tool to trace criminal activity. With a blockchain, I think you get all the benefits.
00:45:47.710 - 00:46:09.330, Speaker A: We can talk a little bit about the growth and then collapse of the euro dollar market, but the Fed is very weary of another euro dollar market. These offshore dollars held by sovereign countries where they don't get to influence and stable coins give all the benefits of a euro dollar but retain the control arguably with the Federal Reserve.
00:46:09.710 - 00:47:02.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a great point. I think a lot of early cypherpunks thought perhaps bitcoin may be that conduit for those inflationary currencies. And it still may be long term, but I think I would love that. The harder thing is because of the volatility, just from the day to day, people prefer to your point on stablecoins. And as blockchain technology becomes more mature, it becomes easier, more frictionless, cheaper to not only create smart contract wallets, but to send around these digital dollars. You can definitely see a world where these us denominated stablecoins are the primary way people kind of store their wealth to transact in everyday commerce.
00:47:03.560 - 00:48:00.656, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right. I think I'm a little bit less bullish on that outcome, maybe just because I do think that, look, the user experience of a bank of America account and a Visa card is really good. If you can trust Visa and you can trust bank of America, and not everyone can am skeptical. Well, I'm a little bit less convinced that across the globe we'll see a huge stable coinization. But I do think that it's a huge upgrade, especially as we get cheaper, higher throughput blockchains, whether that's l two s or l one s across. And also, I'll also add as the UX around navigating different chains starts to be collapsed, then I do think you're going to see this is the preferred method. It's incredible that you can own and custody your own money without having to own a vault or a big bank.
00:48:00.848 - 00:48:19.192, Speaker B: Maybe you spoke to Paul Ryan a little bit, I think, about his op ed about treasuries and how for these stablecoin issuers to earn yield on these tokens, they're buying treasuries and potentially the impact that could have.
00:48:19.296 - 00:48:43.816, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's some competing forces happening here. So if you look at the Federal Reserve, they're very clear. Well, if you read between the lines, right, they don't like stable coins. And the reason they don't like that is it's essentially like the concept of a narrow bank. A narrow bank is a bank that doesn't engage in private credit. So no mortgages, just treasuries. And that's not ideal for the Federal Reserve.
00:48:43.816 - 00:49:12.180, Speaker A: They would much prefer, and you can see this, they only give fed master accounts to organizations that provide private credit. This is a huge, because they're trying to create the money multiplier effect. They want m two blah, blah, blah. So I think there's a little bit of a pushback you're going to see from the Federal Reserve on this side. They made it pretty clear. I hope, though, that they recognize that this is a much better system. And arguably back to the treasuries.
00:49:12.180 - 00:49:54.888, Speaker A: I think that the US has a bit of a debt problem at the moment. Despite what either party says, none of them are fiscally conservative. They've all increased the deficit at massive rates and that's been fine, largely because there is, it seems, quite a bit of buyers for us debt. But that may not be the case forever. It is important that if you're going to continue to run deficits, which unfortunately, I think both parties will continue you to do, you need someone to buy the debt. And so this is a great, and the way that typically works is sort of the dollarization. The more dollars there are, the more debt the Federal Reserve holds on its balance sheets.
00:49:54.888 - 00:50:21.634, Speaker A: The Fed is like sort of the buyer of last resort. And so I think this is a great avenue for an increased demand in treasuries, which is incredibly important if we don't want to end up with a really bad situation where the Fed has to step in and start buying bonds at a huge rate. And so I think for a variety of reasons, stable coins are a great thing for America. And yeah, hopefully people start to see the light.
00:50:21.762 - 00:50:31.218, Speaker B: And is that how we're going to go from the 150, $60 billion in stablecoins today to say a trillion and then 10 trillion?
00:50:31.354 - 00:51:05.030, Speaker A: I think that happens no matter what. There's just too much demand for stable coins. And I mentioned the eurodollar market earlier. So over the last 20 years. Well, let's see, really before that, pre 2008, the euro dollar market, which is essentially dollar bills sitting in banks in other countries with their own sovereignty, was exploding and the Fed had sort of lost control. And you can't really stop this. This isn't something, the Fed is very powerful, the US very powerful, but the dollar is a double edged sword.
00:51:05.030 - 00:51:32.346, Speaker A: You need the dollar to be a global concept, but that necessarily means you're pushing up against other nations and they can do whatever they want. To a certain extent, I think this push and pull kind of plays out in the same way. If the US decides no stable coins, we think they're bad, blah, blah, blah, it doesn't matter. You can't stop tether. I had a meeting.
00:51:32.378 - 00:51:40.210, Speaker B: That's what I always said about blockchains. It's like if the US goes nuclear, it's not like blockchain dies. It just happens everywhere outside of the US.
00:51:40.330 - 00:52:25.296, Speaker A: And look, the dollar is already a global concept. There's no undoing that. So the choice is really, and it's funny because I had a meeting with a conference call with some of the staffers on this latest stablecoin bill, and they think that they can capture tether in terms of jurisdiction. It's just not true, right? I asked them point blank, like, does this make tether illegal? And they were like, well, we believe that they'd be forced registered. And it's just like, that's not how it works, right? Like, if you're operating with no us people in a foreign country and no us vendors, like, there's no avenue for you to take jurisdiction. Like, this is just like how international law works, right? You can't just do whatever you want. And so I think, like, you can't really stop it, right? This is the same thing with the Internet, with cryptography.
00:52:25.296 - 00:52:38.180, Speaker A: There was all of this hullabaloo about, oh, no, if we allow cryptography, then the whole world's going to collapse. What are we going to do? Blah, blah. It doesn't matter. It's too late. The math problems are out there. You can't put them back in. The Internet's the same thing.
00:52:38.180 - 00:53:12.750, Speaker A: There were some countries who tried to do their own little Internet. The great firewall of China, censorship, it doesn't work. All it did was cripple those economies for years, as opposed to the way the US took it, which was just this open marketplace. And I think this is the story I tell to regulators. I was speaking at the New York Fed recently, and this is the story. It's like this is happening. Either it can play out like the Internet did, where 90% of programming languages are written in English, where the US has led tech companies, all of the largest tech companies are us.
00:53:12.750 - 00:53:29.730, Speaker A: That's your choice. Or you can go down the route that China took or Russia took and be second place. And so it's like, this is going to happen. You can't actually stop it. And the choice now is do you want to have regulated, transparent, honest actors, or do you want to have someone you can't control?
00:53:31.110 - 00:54:51.130, Speaker B: It's a fascinating market. I really don't think people more broadly, whether in the crypto industry or even outside of the crypto industry, I mean, it's hard to pay attention to what's going on in crypto from afar. But even people within the industry, I feel like they're not really attuned to stablecoins and just how massive of markets stablecoins have really become and really the product market fit in terms of the cash that these companies teams, protocols are really generating. And if crypto grows as we think it's going to grow, if the demand for the dollar continues to grow as we think it's going to grow, this is probably going to be one of the fastest growing sectors within it. And from this entire conversation, highlighting that cold start problem, making sure you have the liquidity, the barriers to entry are high. But I think the agora is from the connections that you guys have built, the partnerships that you have in place, combined with the fact that you were able to share that yield with the people that are actually providing value to the ecosystem. Share revenue, not yield, sorry, share revenue.
00:54:51.130 - 00:55:01.510, Speaker B: That is massive. And I think really a huge wedge for you guys and probably one of the fastest growing markets in the entire world.
00:55:01.590 - 00:55:34.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, I think our view is this. This is supposed to be a public good. Money is not supposed to be a rent extraction layer. It's not supposed to be a layer to bully people. It's supposed to be as much of the value returned back to the people who provide the value. It's so naive. I hate to be so pointed, but I think it's just incredibly naive to not understand that in a game that has such strong network effects, the idea that you can weld your market power as a big bludgeon on people is just silly.
00:55:34.594 - 00:55:57.310, Speaker A: I think for us, it's like everything should be about just becoming the biggest, and there's a bunch of cool stuff you can build outside of that. I talk a little bit about becoming the shopify. I don't want to be in your business. Your business is e commerce. I'm just shopify. I just have a really nice platform. And here's an app store where we built some tools that maybe you want.
00:55:57.310 - 00:56:20.892, Speaker A: But this idea, I'll just use Circle and Coinbase partnership as an example, where every single USDC that sits on any exchange across the globe is funding the P and L of Coinbase their largest competitor. And if you're an l two, it's funding base. And it's like. And, you know, I think circle is coming out with a wallet. And, like, it's just like. It's so. I'm sorry.
00:56:20.892 - 00:56:35.452, Speaker A: It's just like, competing with your customers is just brain dead. That's the only way. It's like. And so I think, like, yeah, there's an incredible amount. There's incredible opportunity here for a better model to exist. And we think that, like, on a fundamental level, it's a. It's a model that wins in a competitive environment.
00:56:35.556 - 00:56:38.812, Speaker B: I agree. Power back to the people as best.
00:56:38.836 - 00:56:47.360, Speaker A: We can, you know, like, it would be great if we could build it all on chain with immutable contracts and there was no owner owners, but that's not possible. But we're hoping to do the next best thing.
00:56:47.440 - 00:57:00.980, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you feel like maybe that we haven't touched upon in this conversation that listeners should really come away from either about the stablecoin market, Defi Agora, what you guys are building.
00:57:02.040 - 00:57:49.050, Speaker A: I think that the thing that I think people miss is that this is actually an incredibly difficult business. A lot of people think, oh, you just show up and print money, and a lot of people have tried to start both on chain stable coins and fiat coins, and they're starting to fail. Right. If we're being honest, and I think it's because it is a much more complex area of operations than people realize. And this is, I'll be honest, like, something that I learned while I was at fracs that just, like, this business that feels simple is not. And there's a reason why. Yeah, there's a reason why there's basically two decentralized stablecoins that exist at scale.
00:57:49.050 - 00:58:26.790, Speaker A: Fracks and dai and I guess, Athena, if you want to get. But I view that as more of, like, a tokenized financial product. Yeah, it's a complicated business, and I think you see that play out with Circle and their DPEG. And I have so much respect for the team at Tether. I listen to all of Apollo's interviews and I read them anything he puts out, because say all you want about tether, they have $150 billion of assets. They've never had a major DPEG other than the very, very beginning. They sort of pushed this industry forward in a way that enabled crypto to grow.
00:58:26.790 - 00:58:45.320, Speaker A: And it's incredibly difficult to do this at scale. And so I think that's maybe, like, the biggest thing that I think people miss, that it is a complicated business. It is not simple, but it's certainly not worth 100% margins, that's for sure.
00:58:46.180 - 00:59:16.988, Speaker B: Maybe closing out Agora because of the partnerships, the relationships that you guys have been able to cultivate, the engineering talent, defi nativeness, the crypto nativeness, sharing that yield with others. That is the core belief that will give you a door to walk through in terms of getting your foot in the door in the stable coin race.
00:59:17.164 - 00:59:42.026, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a combination of really good partners. We have a very friendly relationship with Vaneck, and obviously State street is custody in our assets. We've got really great partners lined up as well. There are people who want to see us succeed. Frax is a great partner of ours. I mentioned mantle avalanche. We're in talks with a number of other l two s who are just kind of fed up with the incumbents.
00:59:42.026 - 01:00:17.194, Speaker A: We sometimes say it's like we're trying to break up the cartel. So I think, yeah, we will be successful. And I think there's also just a fundamental something that I think I've realized I didn't really fully appreciate until we were building this circle and tether just kind of exist outside of native sort of crypto kind of mind share. And I was writing smart contract. I've always looked at their smart contracts and thought they were pretty bad. And same thing with Pyusd. And I think these people just aren't defi native.
01:00:17.194 - 01:01:03.000, Speaker A: They're just not part of the group of people who've been going to conferences for the last five years who were here in the bear market, who were, you know, and I think that actually is much more powerful than I anticipated at first. You know, there are a lot of people who really want to see us succeed and, yeah, we can't do this alone. Right. Like, something that Nick and I talked about from the very, very beginning was building a coalition and we raised our seed round. We made sure that we had a whole host of investors because we knew that this isn't something you can do alone. You're going to need a lot of partners and you're going to need a lot of help. And it only works if we all work together on it.
01:01:03.000 - 01:01:22.458, Speaker A: I hope that we're capturing the hearts and minds of the people who matter in crypto and that they believe in us. So far, we've gotten a lot of help from them, and we think it that'll drive us through that cold start. And once we reach past it, then you're off to the races.
01:01:22.554 - 01:01:24.258, Speaker B: Rocket ship off to the promised lands.
01:01:24.314 - 01:01:24.722, Speaker A: That's right.
01:01:24.786 - 01:01:30.430, Speaker B: Cool. Well, Drake, any final remarks as we're wrapping up?
01:01:31.610 - 01:01:34.578, Speaker A: No, I think we're in good shape.
01:01:34.634 - 01:01:37.410, Speaker B: Where can people find you? Agora on social media.
01:01:37.490 - 01:01:45.636, Speaker A: Follow me on twitter. Drake evansv one. Follow the agora account. Aurora dollar. Yeah, we just launched our. We just deployed the contract on Mainnet.
01:01:45.708 - 01:01:46.440, Speaker B: Congrats.
01:01:46.740 - 01:01:56.580, Speaker A: So go check that out. Very proud of the code there. We've got a few tricks we'll do, maybe do another podcast about all the cool stuff we did there, but, yeah, I think that's it.
01:01:56.660 - 01:01:57.004, Speaker B: Amazing.
01:01:57.052 - 01:01:58.852, Speaker A: Agora finance go online.
01:01:58.956 - 01:02:28.458, Speaker B: Perfect. Well, keep a lookout for the public to be able to interact with Mainnet. Coming out of beta here shortly. But again, I think it's very exciting. There's not very many projects that I think actually have a chance to really scale. And the team at Agora has really built, let's say, starting to build world class team. I think you guys can actually scale and go the distance.
01:02:28.458 - 01:02:55.542, Speaker B: I think, to me, the entire why I've gotten so excited about the industry is because I think the technology is so school cool, but it's been relatively niche. I've just been obsessive about scale and how we go from, say, the 10 million or so, 50 million of people on chain today to hundreds of millions and billions. And the team that you guys have put together, the partnerships, I'm very excited for what you guys are.
01:02:55.686 - 01:03:12.366, Speaker A: We've been very lucky to get some really talented people. Our co founder, Joe McGrady, was the head of ops at Galaxy. We have great people that we've. That are definative. You know, the on the engineering team is excellent as well. And we've been really lucky. I'll just say, you know, I obsessed when we first started this.
01:03:12.366 - 01:03:43.884, Speaker A: I think I spent, you know, a lot of time, all my time interviewing and, you know, basically convincing people to, this is gonna be big and, you know, it's worthwhile to join and we're able to get, like, really good people and really good team. I'm, like, incredibly lucky every day. You know, I'm thankful that we have such a good team, talented team, a team that cares about crypto. Right. That was a big thing that Nick and I talked about, too, is like, we want people who care about this industry and believe in it and believe that we're going to change it step by step. That's right.
01:03:43.932 - 01:03:46.588, Speaker B: Brick by brick. Awesome. Well, Drake, thank you very much.
01:03:46.684 - 01:03:47.340, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you.
