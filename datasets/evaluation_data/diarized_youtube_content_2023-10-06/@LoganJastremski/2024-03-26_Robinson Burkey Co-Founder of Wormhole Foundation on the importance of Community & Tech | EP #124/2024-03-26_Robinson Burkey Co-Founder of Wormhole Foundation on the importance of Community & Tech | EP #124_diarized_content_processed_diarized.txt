00:00:00.280 - 00:00:35.390, Speaker A: I think for wormhole, we actually had a very interesting situation. One, I don't think there's a lot of other cases in web3, which is we weren't really focused on marketing and stuff for a while. By design, we were just focused on the protocol, lower level protocol. We didn't think about this spinning out of the foundation and everything. Token, all that stuff. We just focused on the protocol for such a long period of time that we actually built some pretty incredible tech. We built across five different runtimes, which is very hard.
00:00:35.390 - 00:01:10.020, Speaker A: We connect 30 plus chains. We have a messaging layer, asset layer, all this stuff. But why I say that is because for us, when we decided to invest more in the community, we want to invest more in bd marketing, et cetera, we had such a strong base to go off of. So I think for us, it was, you know, we almost had like a. It was like this, like, turn on the nozzle moment where we're like, all right, we're ready to start doing this. And I truly almost can pinpoint to where we were like, yes, let's. Let's really start, like, turning this on and getting louder here.
00:01:13.120 - 00:01:20.100, Speaker B: Robinson, thank you so much for coming on the podcast with me today. Really appreciate it. The co founder of Wormhole.
00:01:21.630 - 00:01:32.366, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Logan. Appreciate it. I feel like it's kind of been a long time coming, but I'm happy to be here and chat more about wormhole and some of the stuff we're doing in the web3 space.
00:01:32.558 - 00:02:22.100, Speaker B: Likewise. I think you guys are truly. Oh, we didn't. We talked chat a little bit prior, but I'll give you a compliment. To start out, you guys are truly some of the quickest and fastest builders, I think, in the space, just from idea to execution, is really world class. And I think that in my mind, even outside of the specific product that you guys are building, is really what separates you and the team from other builders in the space, is just how quickly you guys move, because I think it's been very impressive just to watch afar, how much adoption, how quickly the uptick has been, not only about wormhole, but more broadly, the area of focus that the team has been really executing on. It's been very, very cool to watch from afar.
00:02:22.680 - 00:02:53.846, Speaker A: Yeah, I appreciate that. Those are really kind words. I know it would mean a lot to the team as well. I have to attribute a lot of it to our engineering team. They're incredible. Our product and engineering team, we're about, I'd say 80, maybe 80% to 85% product and engineering focused and we kind of have to be. When you think about the interoperability space, the cross chain space is so competitive and you kind of are competing on multiple layers too.
00:02:53.846 - 00:03:22.240, Speaker A: You're competing on this security messaging layer, but also the asset layer. End users have high demands. How do I get this asset to this chain as quickly as possible, securely as possible, with as low fees? So you're always having to solve not only those user demands, but builder demands as well. So yeah, I would just say we're blessed to have an incredible engineering team and we'll continue to ship fast and securely moving forward.
00:03:22.580 - 00:03:39.840, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, maybe before we dive into wormhole and how you guys are really executing on the product side, if you could just give a quick background on yourself, your journey into what is now wormhole, I think that would be super helpful for the audience.
00:03:40.490 - 00:04:13.516, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I've been, I guess, taking high risk bets with my career for the past, the better part of a decade. I started out, I was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, South Florida as most would refer to it as I started. Yeah, that's where I kind of started my career. I ended up kind of always wanting to be involved with startups. Ended up interning at a really small digital media agency. We would work on like a b testing for websites.
00:04:13.516 - 00:05:08.368, Speaker A: You know, this is back in like 20, I don't know, 1415 maybe. Then, you know, I was like, hey, where's kind of startup life? Or where are companies really accelerating? Where are all the startups kind of coalescing? And at the time, and even in the early two thousands, was Silicon Valley, right? So the Mountain view, Palo Alto, San Francisco area. And so I made a plan to go out there. I actually ended up hooking up with a few people building a health text message AI platform. This is actually before AI was cool and it was super rudimentary, but it did have a little bit of a learning, learning aspect, or language learning aspect to it. Back then I think we called it natural language processing, if I remember correctly. And so that company, we built that for about two and a half years.
00:05:08.368 - 00:06:02.266, Speaker A: That company ended up getting acquired by one of the larger incumbents in the space. I was in my mid twenties and I was at a place where I was still looking for high bet companies, I guess to go to earlier stage, higher risk, and I ended up coming across Doordash. I think the thing with a lot of these high risk companies is that people think, oh, you go to a startup and you kind of like, you can ride the rocket ship, but you actually realize how rare that rocket ship actually is and how much work it takes. It is any startup, and there's plenty of people who have worked at them at this point. But like any startup you work at is not a nine to five, right? So I was still in this period, though, where I was, that's what I wanted. I wanted to work. I wanted to work way too much, build my career, be passionate about something.
00:06:02.266 - 00:06:33.736, Speaker A: DoorDash was that next natural progression for me. I think this was in the 2017, 2018. Ended up joining the team, focusing actually on their, I guess, new verticals. Business is what we called it. One product in particular we ended up launching was DoorDash for business. So new verticals, essentially what that is is building a business outside of anything, outside the core business. You can think about the core business as you or I ordering a burrito to your door.
00:06:33.736 - 00:07:26.520, Speaker A: Like most people are familiar with third party delivery at this point, no matter where you are in the world, that's like the core business model, right? It's that food delivery, grocery delivery, et cetera. So we were tasked with, all right, what are all the verticals outside of that, right? Like, how can we apply this kind of gig economy delivery model to other things? Some of the things we explored at the time, grocery was actually a new vertical. So, like, delivering groceries, businesses were new verticals, right? So setting up catering for businesses, we actually, I delivered. I think it was maybe the first or one of the first actual catering orders ever. And that business ended up being like a $500 million run rate a year type business, which was cool, but we would be the door dashers at the beginning, which was really funny. But long story short, ended up doing that for quite some time, was with Doordasher.
00:07:27.140 - 00:08:21.550, Speaker B: Go ahead to double click on that just for a second. Going back to your earlier point, it is very rare that you join a company at that early stage and you get that hyper growth. I think people very much underappreciate. Everybody thinks you join a startup, and obviously the hope is that you get to experience that or participate in that type of growth. But there's a lot of homework or luck or both that really go into being able to be at the right place, right time, do the homework to say, hey, I think this company is actually going to do fairly well and then actually put into the work once you get your foot in the door to make some magic happen. And I think, to your point, people really do not understand how hard those jumps are or the risks that ultimately you take during that. I mean, when I joined TesLa, when I was in the bay.
00:08:21.550 - 00:08:50.516, Speaker B: It was definitely much more later stage than I would say, doordash. But at that point in time, the narrative around Tesla was that it was going bankrupt and going zero. And I think after I joined, it was Covid and the stock went ten x. But again, it's doing those unpopular things ANd taking those risks when other people won't. Again, they'rE calculated risks. They don't always work out. But it's ImportaNt, especially in one's career, and you're younger, to take Those opportunities.
00:08:50.516 - 00:08:55.200, Speaker B: And so kudos to you for putting yourself out there, because that is not easy.
00:08:55.740 - 00:09:09.518, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's. The cliches in life become more and more apparent. Right. Like, one I always think about is like, you know, if it were easy, everyone would do it. Right? Or, you know, if people are saying.
00:09:09.518 - 00:09:31.678, Speaker A: Talking about something as it's a good idea, you're probably too late. Right. You need people to kind of almost, like, question what you're doing a little bit, because if they aren't that, you know, they would be doing the same thing, and then that, quote, unquote, trade is traded. Right. That career move is. Other people are pursuing the same one. So, yeah, I think, look, it's definitely.
00:09:31.678 - 00:09:47.720, Speaker A: There's a risk aspect to it. There's a comfortability with people kind of questioning what you're doing. You have to be comfortable to that to a certain extent. And then, like you said, Logan, I'd be lying if I didn't say luck also plays a big role in it as well.
00:09:48.780 - 00:09:59.240, Speaker B: So an apologies, I cut you off. After you spearheaded that initiative. You kind of saw it through IPO. What was the next step in your career?
00:10:00.020 - 00:10:44.632, Speaker A: Yeah. So, funny enough, like most people know, when a company ipos, they become much more compliant. They tighten up on a lot of things. And you can probably guess from, for someone who really likes to be at the earlier stage, maybe you could call it the uglier stage, the excessive work stage. It wasn't what I had really wanted anymore. At the same time, in my personal life, my fiance actually was one of the earlier, like, I guess you could say, founding employees at this co living company. And for those of you who aren't familiar, San Francisco, you know, I would say early to mid two thousands even now, has horrible housing issues.
00:10:44.632 - 00:11:11.716, Speaker A: Right. There's like this very much so fixed supply. It's like a seven mile by seven mile almost square. Houses are kind of capped in terms of how high they can build. And so there's a horrible housing problem there. So, long story short hub house was what the company was called. They would like rent these large residential homes, furnish them, handle new, I guess you could say, roommates moving in and out.
00:11:11.716 - 00:11:37.986, Speaker A: They would handle the financials. The target market, as you probably can imagine, was like 20 to 30. So at the time, I was actually living in one of those. We were living the product, and I was living in one of those homes. And that's actually where I found out about crypto. One of my roommates essentially started mining, was mining ethereum, back when you could mine ethereum. And so there was like this little like side closet in the house.
00:11:37.986 - 00:11:58.340, Speaker A: And, you know, I was, I actually didn't say anything for like a few weeks. I was just like, you know, he's doing, doing something. I was busy with my work. I was in focus. Then I was like, what are you doing over here? He started telling me about it, didn't catch right away. Then I started doing my own research. Like, most people started to kind of like get, get more and more interested.
00:11:58.340 - 00:12:26.860, Speaker A: And then fast forward a couple months. Him and I were running these mining rigs. The whole garage was almost kind of filled up with them, if you will. And the funny thing was, at the time, that company had a fixed utility cost. It's like your classic mining with fixed utility arbitrage, if you will. But it was a conflict of interest because my fiance was so involved in high up at the company. Long story short, we ended up having to shut them down, which was totally fine.
00:12:26.860 - 00:13:19.256, Speaker A: But that's the impetus for me getting involved. And then from there, I had always been interested in interoperability, because thinking about systems in general, with blockchains, there's a lot of systems, a lot of systems that don't talk to each other. So when I think about, even when joining a startup, what is that critical problem they're solving that picks and shovels, infrastructure level problem? Same assessment maybe I would make with a doordash or something like that. I applied it to the web3 space. And if I make this general assumption that there's going to be a number of blockchains, which people didn't always used to believe, a lot of people, and some people still believe the whole world's going to be built on Ethereum. But I essentially was like, okay, if this is true, then interoperability is important. Who's doing it? Well, today, at the time, it was Polkadot.
00:13:19.256 - 00:13:36.966, Speaker A: It was cosmos as well, but it was Polkadot. I was like, oh, Polkadot's interesting. My thesis was so simple. It was Gavin Wood, Washington way back when with Vitalik, they built, you know, Ethereum. Gavin Wood coded up the EVM. He was like, it's not going to scale. He went and built polka dot.
00:13:36.966 - 00:13:50.286, Speaker A: I was so sold on that, I was like, yes, this makes sense. So that's, that's originally, I'll stop there. But that's kind of like, originally like where, why? Like how I got interested and I ended up getting involved in the Polkadot ecosystem.
00:13:50.478 - 00:14:28.480, Speaker B: But yeah, yeah, it is amazing backstory. I mean, Gavin Wood, I think a very logical conclusion that involved early in the technical side with Ethereum funded Ethereum, and was going to push the face space forward with Polkadot. I think the jury is still out on that, but appreciate that there is an opportunity to continue to experiment there. So how do that ultimately transition you into what is now wormhole and kind of spearheading this initiative?
00:14:28.900 - 00:15:02.580, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I ended up, for a short period of time, getting involved with the chain launch of Acala, which. So for those of you aren't familiar in Polkadot, they're app chains, they call them parachains. So it was the first ever app chain within the Polkadot ecosystem that was very much so. Foot in the door for me. Right. I had not been involved in crypto professionally at the time, and I knew it personally, but getting involved professionally is a very different beast, especially at like a high level.
00:15:02.580 - 00:15:41.660, Speaker A: So I actually was then looked around. I was like, who else is doing now that I've kind of had this initial experience, like, who else is kind of the best in the game, if you will, and jump crypto, very much so. Was that right? They are a massive trading firm today. They had an incredible incubation product, incubation arm, and that was super interesting to me. So I ended up joining the jump crypto team. I was solely focused on wormhole and building out wormhole within jump. Jump also incubated a few other products, including PIF.
00:15:41.660 - 00:16:43.516, Speaker A: I think a lot of people are familiar, but I think the idea was there was so much conviction around this piece of infrastructure because crypto absolutely needs it. I think a lot of the space kind of suffers with product market fit syndrome, but, like, wormhole doesn't, it's very much apparent that it's needed and it's more about scaling it and making it secure, really. Those are the things we really focus on. So once I ended up there and we kind of built that product out for, I don't know, a long time, maybe about like over a year, we always knew we had to spin it out. We always knew that wormhole needed to be this completely decentralized, not only decentralized protocol, but contributed to in a decentralized way. So that was always the plan. So we ended up, I think this was back in May, May 2023, April 2023, we spun wormhole out into a number of different organizations.
00:16:43.516 - 00:17:20.139, Speaker A: So I co founded the Wormhole foundation. We also have wormhole Labs and then we have x labs. So we do have a number of, I guess you could say, core contributing entities, but the model is pretty familiar at this point. For those that do work in the space, you have Solana Foundation, Solana Labs. They've recently spun out more organizations to contribute to the protocol. And I think this is by design you want for us at wormhole, it's important that it's completely open source. There is no central, of course, the foundation is the main coordinating entity, but there's no kind of like central controlling contributor.
00:17:20.139 - 00:17:25.659, Speaker A: So back in April May, we spun it out, and we've been kind of full steam ahead since then.
00:17:28.959 - 00:18:33.880, Speaker B: Outside of kind of the product. I think what's a little bit amazing to me is just being able to repeatedly kind of take a bet on yourself or these high growth industries, uh, that you're able to parlay one thing into another. And I always say, like, in retrospect, it's obvious and easy, but when you're doing it, because I've done it, it's very hard. It's scary, it's frightening, uh, and it doesn't feel good at all during multiple times to, through that process and to not reinvent yourself, but to continue to push, I think that's hard. And so, again, just kudos to you for pushing there where others may not ever, in most cases, will not. And so now you co founded, you co founded Wormhole foundation. What is kind of the role with foundation are you spearheading, particularly just projects getting integrated into wormhole? What's kind of the more broader vision at foundation?
00:18:34.460 - 00:19:06.348, Speaker A: Absolutely. So today, the wormhole foundation owns everything, or put drives everything other than essentially writing code, I guess you could say. We still do ship a little bit of code. However, we're not even close to the main contributor, wormhole labs, ex labs. They do the majority of, I would say, core protocol engineering, and that's by design. Right? And so we also have had other contributors come on board. There's candidly so many.
00:19:06.348 - 00:19:43.720, Speaker A: So that is actually where I would say is the first kind of role of the foundation is being kind of this coordinating entity. So I sometimes view one of our roles at the very least of like building this all star team, right. We have this protocol, you know, we want to continue to proliferate this protocol. Who are the best people in the space to kind of continue to align with, to build this? So obviously, I mentioned wormhole labs, X labs. They're kind of longer term protocol builders. We recently invested a lot in zero knowledge, so we've got four different teams contributing to wormhole. On that front, security is super important.
00:19:43.720 - 00:20:12.366, Speaker A: So what I'm trying to say here is the first role really is like coordination. Making sure you're building the best team is kind of how I see it. However, we also do run all of the marketing, all the community, all of the BD, any sort of ecosystem related things. When I say ecosystem, that can mean a lot, but I, you know, it could mean community, but it also means grants, right. Grants are obviously a big part of building on the protocol, making sure people are aligned, they're getting paid for their work.
00:20:12.438 - 00:20:12.742, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:12.806 - 00:20:30.620, Speaker A: So we do a lot of that as well. And you'll oftentimes hear the term like stewards of the protocol. But I do think that kind of encompasses it in that, like anything that drives wormhole forward that isn't being a majority contributor to the code base is what wormhole foundation is focusing on.
00:20:31.920 - 00:21:31.070, Speaker B: Yeah, it is all encompassing. I think it's half of it. I think personally, I love the engineering side, focusing on the nitty gritty of the technical aspects. How does it actually work under the hood? But I think most teams, especially within crypto, don't focus enough on the community side and what that product is actually going to be doing. Focusing on the BD efforts, getting kind of that user feedback and making sure that loop from engineering to the community is very intertwined. And I think wormhole has done a good job about making sure these two parties, one from the engineering side and foundation, really try to close that loop as much as possible, because it is a challenge. And I've seen countless web3 teams really fall on their face here.
00:21:31.070 - 00:21:40.370, Speaker B: They can build something really cool technically, but it doesn't matter if you don't get the eyeballs or attention on the product. Can you talk a little bit more about how you guys are approaching that?
00:21:41.230 - 00:21:50.886, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I actually talk about this a lot because I think it's super important to understand why this industry might be different from other, let's say for a lot of us, b, two b.
00:21:50.958 - 00:21:51.286, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:51.358 - 00:22:16.264, Speaker A: For wormhole, we're very much so. A b, two b. But you have to be b, two b, two c here in a way because you ultimately have token holders, users that the developers building with wormhole are interacting with. But I think from. I'll talk about the industry and I'll talk about wormhole. One thing that you made a great point on is that there are teams that focus purely on the tech. And the tech is incredible.
00:22:16.264 - 00:22:51.868, Speaker A: And it's almost a travesty that they don't do as well as they should. I want to be careful calling specific teams out. I actually have a lot of respect for the Polkadot ecosystem. I think the tech is incredible. But as we've seen, and hopefully this is more of an objective statement and I don't get skewered, but as we've seen, they haven't been as much in the limelight as some of these other chains for reasons we don't necessarily. A lot of people could speculate on. But I think the theme there is a lot of respect for the tech, but maybe they're missing the go to market community element.
00:22:51.868 - 00:23:47.970, Speaker A: And it's interesting you've also seen on the other side where there's no tech but their community and go to market element is so strong that it buys them either time and or capital to actually fulfill some of the promises that maybe they made. And they can almost, what I call it is like meme themselves into existence. And so I used to look at that, I'd say when I first started, I'd be like, oh, like that's vaporware, right? Like, it wouldn't pay them much mind, you know, long term. Like these more like product engineering driven organizations are going to do laps around them. Well, you know, that's still a lot of times the case. Like, I definitely second guess that that assumption I previously had. I think if a team is really, really good at community, community building, marketing, they can buy themselves time, get themselves capital, and ultimately deliver on whatever.
00:23:47.970 - 00:24:26.170, Speaker A: They're very ambitious product roadmap is. I think for wormhole, we actually had a very interesting situation. One, I don't think there's a lot of other cases in web3, which is we weren't really focused on marketing and stuff for a while. By design, we were just focused on the protocol, lower level protocol. We didn't think about this spinning out of the foundation and everything, token, all that stuff. We just focused on the protocol for such a long period of time that we actually built some pretty incredible tech. We built across five different runtimes, which is very hard.
00:24:26.170 - 00:25:00.422, Speaker A: We connect 30 plus chains, we have a messaging layer, asset layer, all this stuff. But why I say that is because for us, when we decided to, all right, we want to invest more in the community. We want to invest more in bd marketing, et cetera. We had such a strong base to go off of. So I think for us, we almost had. It was this turn on the nozzle moment where we're like, all right, we're ready to start doing this. And I truly almost can pinpoint to where we were like, yes, let's really start turning this on and getting louder here.
00:25:00.422 - 00:25:22.390, Speaker A: But I think my summary would be, in this industry, you have to watch both. You have to watch the ones with tech and no marketing. Can they get this 50%, this marketing community and the other side. Right, like marketing but no tech. Because I think they, and, you know, bold statement here. I think they almost have equal opportunity in some instances in this industry.
00:25:22.850 - 00:25:59.280, Speaker B: I think you hit the nail on the head. To me. I was definitely in the same camp as you as, like, flooding that bag purely from a technical standpoint. But then, like, time and time again, it's like, all right, they stuck around. People show them enough, they get this flywheel momentum where they can actually either go out and accu hire or buy or raise additional capital to go out and try to fulfill that original vision, as you stated. And it's been interesting to me. I think what I've learned is, especially in crypto, it's attention really drives the capital.
00:25:59.280 - 00:27:05.084, Speaker B: And that's not always kind of the correct way to capital allocate, in my opinion, because narratives can often be incorrect or temporary and can drive some weird incentives, especially with crypto. And you have kind of earlier liquidity profiles and traditional venture. But on the flip side, that allows teams to do some powerful things if they learn how to harness that attention machine. And I think some teams have been much better at that than others. Some teams have been much more technically sound, but have really fall flat on their face because they've ignored kind of the product side of that, where they fail to get user adoption even if they have a cool product. And so I think the crypto industry is just unique. I think it's probably a byproduct of that earlier time to liquidity and some of the weird incentives that that plays in part.
00:27:05.084 - 00:27:08.492, Speaker B: But it is interesting. You got to do a little bit of both.
00:27:08.676 - 00:27:39.288, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes it fun. It makes it entertaining. It's like nothing, you know, we've maybe seen before. And honestly, for the job of capital allocators, it's really hard. Narratives are a real thing, and if you think you're above a narrative, you should question yourself. You're going to fall victim to one and think it's just the next big thing, and then you realize it's temporary. So I think it's an extremely hard job being a capital allocator in this space.
00:27:39.464 - 00:28:17.100, Speaker B: It is tricky. I've learned how you think is very important. Uh, question your assumptions. I think, uh, the Tesla approach, uh, which at least has served us well, but, uh, will remain to be seen how it performs long term. But in terms of, uh, foundation and I mean, kind of, we've been chatting their role there, but where do you see more from the product side and not necessarily the technical aspects, but how people use long wormhole long term, where do you see that and kind of how the current landscape of blockchains is shaping up?
00:28:17.480 - 00:29:00.840, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I might answer this question a little longer than you want, but I think it's important to provide a little, establish at least a baseline for how we should think about wormhole. And I would say the interoperability space in general, interoperability as a concept, it's a mouthful. Is really nothing new, right? Swift connects banking systems. It's like this interop solution, this messaging solution. So these banking systems that don't speak to each other can even cloud servers to a certain extent, have to interoperate with one another. So we're just taking this concept of systems that don't necessarily talk to each other.
00:29:00.840 - 00:29:42.176, Speaker A: We're taking this concept and we're applying it to blockchain at the very high level. So from the foundation's perspective, the way we see things is one thing we can probably all agree on is the one chart that's gone up into the rights for the past, let's call it a little over five years, has been the number of blockchains. There was actually a time when, and I mentioned this a little bit earlier, where molding chain was definitely not a consensus. And that was when I first started getting into this space more seriously. Definitely not like common knowledge that there was going to be lots of chains. Now, you know, you try and make an argument that there's only one chain, I don't even think you can't. Like, that's just not possible.
00:29:42.176 - 00:29:47.040, Speaker A: Like, no one's gonna, I mean, maybe you can, but anyway, I am curious.
00:29:47.120 - 00:30:23.470, Speaker B: To see, like maybe yes, there are multiple chains today. I very much think the jury is still out in some regards. How do you view, do you view it as like chains will specify or into specific areas of focus? Are you kind of of the belief that there's going to be thousands or hundreds of thousands of l two s or specific app chains. Do you think it's like one integrated chain that has majority market share? Just out of curiosity?
00:30:23.900 - 00:31:01.720, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think it's a great question. Look, I would say my thesis right now is that there'll be a few settlement layers, a few select settlement layers, and then a number of different execution layers. Those execution layers will ultimately have to be connected somehow as well. When I think about a world where there's, I don't know, hundreds, thousands, to me, what I come back to is actual infrastructure for launching a chain and how much it takes to do that. I know there's lots of different models out there. Some you don't need validators, some you do, like, oh, there's all different types of stuff. But I think what it comes down to and for us, as like, an entity, we.
00:31:01.720 - 00:32:00.916, Speaker A: We're kind of in the business of launching chains. You know, we're that core infrastructure that a lot of chains need day one, to get liquidity from a Solana, to get liquidity from an ethereum. Especially if they're an alt l one and they're not an l two, right? So when we think about, like, these other chains, even l two s, like, there's so much infrastructure, chain needs to be successful. Right now, the market's kind of hard to decipher, like, which chain's successful, which one's not. We look at a lot of data. We look at like, you know, on chain activity to figure out, like, what chains we're going to next or how much chain coverage we currently have and the amount of, like, resourcing and users and developers and infrastructure, whether it's native USDC, CCP bridges, liquidity, fragmentation, that's not necessarily infrastructure, but all these things that are required for a chain to hit a critical mass of almost adoption. It's a lot.
00:32:00.916 - 00:32:42.840, Speaker A: It is a lot to see these chains be successful. From our perspective, we are a little agnostic in terms of how this plays out as long as there are these separate, let's say, these chains, if you will, or state machines, et cetera. So, you know, when I think of. When I hear people talk about like hundreds of thousands or thousands, you know, I candidly am a bit skeptical. Again, like, I wouldn't be in this space if I couldn't look back in a year on this podcast and be like, damn, I was wrong. But, you know, based on our experience of launching chains to date and what we notice it takes for chains to be successful, to be a Solana, to be an avalanche, etcetera. It's a lot.
00:32:42.840 - 00:32:50.070, Speaker A: And I'd be surprised if we seed I all these different kind of successful chains in the future.
00:32:50.770 - 00:33:56.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I prescribed to that vision as well, where maybe there's a handful of virtual machines that stick around and kind of cross the chasm. And then there are a couple predominant blockchains that perhaps have the majority of smart contract applications deployed on them, or shared state. Then you can have these specialized l two s or whatever app chains that potentially some applications need. But regardless of all that, you still need some interconnective tissue between them to do message passing to move assets from one ecosystem to another. And maybe this is a good segue, I think, to broader the competition out there. I think message passaging or doing bridging services has historically been tricky, to say the least. And there are now different parties trying to tackle this with different solutions.
00:33:56.810 - 00:34:12.070, Speaker B: How would you kind of frame wormhole more broadly in this more competitive landscape? I think the industry as a whole is competitive, but the bridging landscape is definitely heating up as well.
00:34:12.450 - 00:34:52.328, Speaker A: Yeah, the reason why I think it's competitive is, let's say some sort of proliferation of chains. Maybe we've come to some conclusion there's a certain amount, but then there almost has to be a consolidation of interoperability layers because it's less devex overhead, it's less liquidity fragmentation. It ultimately is just, it's like what has to happen in a way. Like a lot of times I'll say I think there'll be a few amount that ultimately end up coming on top. Those would be aggregated, etcetera. But the way to think about Wormwoli, first we have to understand the competitive landscape. They're very much so is two layers in a cross chain space that oftentime gets grouped together.
00:34:52.328 - 00:35:19.910, Speaker A: And I think you said it right, logan is like message passing is one. So this idea of sharing states how you share state between two chains. And then I view the layer on top of that as the asset layer. So the asset layer could be a token bridge, your traditional lock and mint. It could be across chain swap, it could be an intent space protocol. There's all these optimizations we've done at the asset layer of how to take this token x on chain a to token y on chain b. Right.
00:35:19.910 - 00:35:55.214, Speaker A: So for wormal in particular, we're very much so competing at this layer. But we need to make sure the teams competing at this layer are building with wormhole, because that adds value to our network. So look, I think for us we know what you should care about in this industry. Number one is security, and I can dive into that in a second. I think given our past, we've come back with a force as one of the most battle tested and one of the strongest security teams in the industry, and I'll stand by that and can give reasons why. The other thing is network effects. Network effects are a real thing.
00:35:55.214 - 00:36:19.128, Speaker A: Right. I think there's, wormhole's at 30 plus chains now across five runtimes. That is very technically complex. I think the next closest interoperability protocol has two, maybe three, maybe I'm not even certain on that. So we're across SVM, EVM, Cosmos, and move Algorand. And I even think there's one more, like, let's call it like a half run time. So there's that.
00:36:19.128 - 00:37:06.070, Speaker A: There's that, like, kind of a moat or network effect there. And I think when it comes to new incumbents, right at the messaging layer, I. That is so much to overcome because, yes, maybe you can offer, like, let's say you go from Ethereum to b and b chain, and you have some sort of small, like, it's slightly more secure because of x, Y and Z. At the end of the day, like, the user doesn't care about just going from ETH and BNB. The user wants to go to as many chains as possible, as fast as possible, from native to native assets in the most secure way possible. And so you have this thing that happens with interrupt protocols now where I do think network effects are a real thing. So we're starting to see a certain group kind of like, pull away at the messaging layer at least.
00:37:06.070 - 00:37:36.542, Speaker A: And then you got it. Once you see that group, you've defined the category, you say, okay, now, what's the differentiation between this group? So you could say runtimes they've built across, you could say apps that have built on top of them. Very similar to how an assessment maybe you'd make with Solana or Ethereum. Right? Like cross chain, borrow lens pip is entirely, you know, runs on wormhole. Right? Like, every message price fee that goes through pith is built on wormhole. So all of a sudden, you get all of these, like, applications that have a critical dependency on the liveness of your network. So I'll stop there.
00:37:36.542 - 00:37:49.330, Speaker A: But if I were to summarize, I would say the network affects the security and ultimately the devx you provide that gives you the apps on top at the asset layer that users are going to use.
00:37:50.230 - 00:39:03.400, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think you laid them out rather well. And maybe it's good to push forward the conversation into the security aspect, because historically that has been a challenge for the entire industry. I would definitely agree that the liquidity begets liquidity, and especially with some of these newer chains and onboarding them, making sure that each chain has ample liquidity on each side to move these assets from one chain to another can be harder. And the more that the network effects kind of accrue to a single protocol or standardization, better that becomes for everybody else. But I think on the flip side of that is everybody, at least in the crypto industry thus far, has read stories and been a little cautious about bridging protocols. How, I guess, can you remain confident that these will continue to be secure over time? Security is actually getting better as you introduce more and more protocols?
00:39:03.820 - 00:39:28.794, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I love talking about this. I try to remove my bias in terms of optimism for the bridging industry, but I truly am. And I'll kind of explain tactically why it's not because of audits, by the way. I think audits are table stakes. I think that's just something that we internally and externally audit everything. Again, that's table stakes.
00:39:28.794 - 00:40:06.160, Speaker A: So for us, we have what I view as an internal security team. Technically, they're external, but this is the spin out from jump. So I think from a bridging perspective, from an interoperability protocol, you should have an in house security team. First and foremost, for us, when we think about this space, there's two ways in which we're driving forward the security of it. Number one is what I would call defense in depth. A lot of people, I think, expect a very novel web3 solution to security and bridging and things like that. There definitely are some.
00:40:06.160 - 00:40:35.066, Speaker A: And we'll get into that second bucket in a second. It has to do with zero knowledge. But for us, we've developed proactive security features for wormhole protocol. And the way I'll position this for those listening, I almost think about it like a bank. Let's say Logan and I are about to go. We're about to go rob a bank. And let's pretend we've watched a lot of bank heist movies, so we're going to get really elaborate with it.
00:40:35.066 - 00:40:55.430, Speaker A: When you rob a bank, there's a number of different levels you have to go through. Maybe there's a security guard at the front. So how do you disarm and get past the security guard? Maybe there's the lasers where you have to jump through and not trip one. Right. That's your second layer, if you will. You go through both of those, you get all the way to the vault door. That's your third layer.
00:40:55.430 - 00:41:35.298, Speaker A: And then finally, you get to a point where if you get past all those three, you get access to the cash or whatever, the crown jewels, etcetera. So, for us, that's how we kind of think about the wormhole protocol and security. So we've actually launched, in the past year an entire. We launched our own blockchain. And the main reason for that blockchain is because it offers a particular security feature that's very advantageous for the network. It's what we call the global accountant. So what the blockchain does is it gives us a ledger, like blockchains do, and we're essentially able to double verify any asset transaction on contracts across all wormhole connected chains.
00:41:35.298 - 00:42:03.490, Speaker A: And so what that means is, like, let's say there's two checks that happen. So the check will happen on Solana, then it'll happen on gateway. If it's wrong, like, if someone's able to do to mint more than they were supposed to, it will cut the connection with that chain immediately. So what that does is it contains any sort of contagion that might happen. So that's like feature one. The second feature is what we call governor, or the governor. And the idea behind the governor is it actually limits.
00:42:03.490 - 00:42:29.640, Speaker A: Flows between chains, for better or for worse. Sometimes, you know, teams will hit, or users will hit the flow and they have to wait 24 hours. But the idea is that today, the governor is really dumb. It says something like, only can send $75 million between Ceylon and Ethereum in a 24 hours period in the future. The governor, and we're already working on this v two is very smart. It goes per asset. It can make limits.
00:42:29.640 - 00:43:01.026, Speaker A: Let's say it's a much more popular asset, limits higher. Instead of just one flow, maybe there's something we can do around wallets, an OFAC flag wallet of some sort, like, you know, trigger the bridge, etcetera. So I don't want to, like, get too into the detail, but I think what I'm. What I'm trying to lay out here is that there we have launched a lot of proactive features, not just audits. And these features would take a lot more for anything to happen that's one on the other side is zero knowledge. So zero. When I say zero knowledge, I don't mean privacy.
00:43:01.026 - 00:43:31.722, Speaker A: So for wormhole, the way wormhole works at a very high level is you essentially, there's a consensus, right? We have 19 guardians, branded term for validators. You essentially need 19 or 13 of the 19 to come to consensus on every message, essentially every data that's sent through the warmhole protocol. This is a robust model. Uniswap voted it at the most secure and trusted model. They use it for all their governance. Deployments or governance. Yeah, deployments.
00:43:31.722 - 00:44:10.810, Speaker A: However, how can we make it better? We still have to rely on people, entities. What zero knowledge does is it kind of brings you down this trustless spectrum. Instead of having to trust that these 13, while albeit very large, staking entities, have to agree on something, you're essentially moving that to math. You have zero knowledge proofs on this ideal world, which is sooner than we think on every chain. And instead of trusting entities, you're trusting that proof. We're investing a lot in this. We brought on teams lurk, zpoken, succinct, announcing one more.
00:44:10.810 - 00:44:28.710, Speaker A: And they're building, like clients across all major chains. And we're actually almost done with a few. So hopefully that's a little bit helpful. I know that was long winded on the security side, but I think for us, it's like, what can we do proactive today? And then what can we be investing from the research side of the future?
00:44:29.560 - 00:45:25.400, Speaker B: No, I think that is definitely the correct approach. You need your own in house assassins that will try to break things, make sure that it's really bulletproof. Because to your point, audits are really de facto standard, but you need someone to continuously do that. And even at Tesla, I mean, Tesla when I was there, had an internal team that would just try to hack things and break things. And if you could get in, you had to immediately patch whatever you're doing in to make sure that those vulnerabilities were no longer there. But I very much appreciate that approach. And then on the flip side, I think doubling down on the research is something that is not only important for kind of traditional companies to do, like reinvest in their future, but also within crypto companies.
00:45:25.400 - 00:45:58.070, Speaker B: And I think the ZK vacation of the world is very interesting. It kind of goes down different rabbit holes of what the zero knowledge technology will be used for. But I think in the bridging kind of interoperability standpoint, it makes a lot of sense for making sure that the verification of state is actually valid and can be a little bit more secure than what we have today.
00:45:58.450 - 00:46:26.806, Speaker A: Absolutely. Absolutely. And it's funny because we've seen a lot of these CK teams actually come to. We've been working with a lot of them, and it's great. We're going to continue to, but it's one of the main, and I would say like more promising, not more promising. One of the promising commercial use cases for zero knowledge. Like we have use cases and ideas on monetization and things like that for ZK today.
00:46:26.806 - 00:47:06.940, Speaker A: Right? Like there could be a world where you're choosing your verification method, but like to a user that could be displayed as maybe we don't expose this user. I'm just giving an example, for example sake, like if your most secure cross chain message is this, with ZK, it's going to take a little bit more time, but you pay a premium in case you're sending, I don't know, a million dollars cross chain or a very important governance vote. Again, not saying that flows actually how it's going to happen, but it's very much so. Again, commercial use cases for this technology that's been long researched in its use cases today.
00:47:07.810 - 00:48:20.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm very much appreciative of tech because of the tech that actually has product applications, because I think outside of crypto not being very good at the marketing or getting community on board, they're also very good at creating new infrastructure problems that create new infrastructure problems that don't actually solve problems, in my opinion. And I think the application of the technology is very important and making sure that it does have a product use case. And I think to your .0 knowledge, technology actually is very well suited for this one particular task and can add a lot of benefits to the long term of the industry because I think as the future is multi chain in some regard, you can play with the percentages and where the kind of majority of market share lives, but there are going to be multiple chains. And in that world you do need secure message passing or assets being transferred from one ecosystem to another. And this seems like the end state of kind of that technology stack.
00:48:20.790 - 00:49:08.640, Speaker A: Yeah. And the last thing I'll say too is let's call this what we've been kind of chatting about, like maybe what the public blockchain network could be, but we're starting to have more and more conversations with folks that run private blockchain networks. Right. I think there's no secret that JP Morgan's been doing this for a while and there's others. And so those networks, I would say private to public, are also going to want to connect to the public blockchain networks. And whether they're sending assets, tokenized assets, or data for x, y and z use case, there's still application beyond the world we oftentimes think in, which is ethereum, Solana, arbitrum, Cosmos chain, etcetera.
00:49:09.580 - 00:49:39.890, Speaker B: Where do you settle on kind of like the intranets versus the Internet on kind of the blockchain adoption scale? Do you think it's a mixture of both? I think in the early kind of like or late nineties, the intranet or internal kind of Internet within companies was going to be more popular. I think it is a mixture, though, within blockchain technologies, just because you may want to have a private blockchain where it's confidential. But I'm curious where it shakes up long term.
00:49:40.470 - 00:50:37.260, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I think we've seen time and time again that public networks play out open source software. There's almost like network effects to the building on that. I think AOL at some point was even intra, and they eventually realized that that was a losing game and opened it up. However, I think there's still going to be use cases and especially in like the financial sector around certain like confidentiality or keeping things private and then kind of at your choice. And maybe it's in a KYC manner, maybe it's in a privacy, in some sort of privacy transmission. But you know, there is going to be need for private blockchains, in my opinion. I just like, you know, there are needs for those in companies today, but ultimately, like, you want to connect those to what would be the much larger network, which is the public network.
00:50:37.260 - 00:50:45.420, Speaker A: I think it will follow a very similar path. I think is my no silver bullet answer, but I do think, again, there's applications for it.
00:50:45.800 - 00:51:46.780, Speaker B: Agreed. I think Ben Horitz in one of his recent books said there are no silver bullets, they're only lead bullets. You have to do multiple rounds. But as we're kind of approaching, kind of like the hour mark, maybe just wrapping up the podcast, where do you kind of see the future of either 2024 ending up? Where do you see kind of wormholes playing a role within that? And kind of as we start to hit mass adoption, not purely from a market cap standpoint, but actually bring users on that and engineers that are product focused and building applications, where do you see this space is headed? Because historically it's still extremely niche in terms of user adoption and product adoption. But where does that end up? Either end of this year or even five years out?
00:51:47.480 - 00:52:37.224, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hard. It's hard for these forward looking statements are, and I also, just like most people fall to my subjective, the world I view crypto in because of what I work on. But look, I think I'll just continue down that lane because it's probably the best bet I have of being semi right here. Look, I think that interoperability protocols are one of the best actual solves for any sort of UX or even devx type things. If we think about the most important thing, a lot of people say, users, user adoption, getting people to use applications, we've all heard the terms so much, I hate saying them of, your grandma doesn't need to know she's using a blockchain. All this stuff. Let's just agree.
00:52:37.224 - 00:53:44.170, Speaker A: Sure, that might be correct. We want them to use applications that somehow things settle on chain. What's interesting with wormhole is that if we can become more secure and our devx becomes better, and we build these developer tools around wormhole, I actually think it helps with that thesis. It helps with the idea of building applications that can have a hub and spoke model where their logic is connected by these interoperability protocols. And they can use execution over here, they can verify some sort of PFP that lives on ethereum with a cross chain query or attestation. And it almost presents itself like a website, right? Like how the website, whenever you're doing something like even the checkout page on Amazon is loading like five different things in this asynchronous way to ultimately present you with the user experience that we're all used to. And I think about it very similarly from an interop and user experience on chain.
00:53:44.170 - 00:54:34.530, Speaker A: Again, we just launched queries, the ability to say, to build a game on Solana. But I can also query if you have a punk on Ethereum and in a decentralized and almost trustless way, verify that in under a second. That type of tech is now becoming mature enough and easy enough for these apps to integrate where you can have, I think, ultimately abstract away the what chain am I on question again? I said I'd stay in my lane because I think it has the best chance of me being right. But I do think interoperability protocols are going to be a huge, a huge part of this quote unquote adoption that we've all been talking about. And that's where we have to go, right? We have to get to this 2024 and onward has to end more adoption. And that's the role we feel like we're playing in helping us get there.
00:54:35.150 - 00:55:34.700, Speaker B: Fully agree. I'm very much now just kind of in the show me, show me the money phase and like where the products were, the users, because I think some of it has been a little bit too circular for some time. And I very much appreciate that you guys are actually pushing forward the product front to help builders make more interesting applications. Because to me that is really what the space needs. If someone were to come away, though, after watching this podcast, listening about your history, kind of your career journey, but ultimately learning about what Wormhole is doing, the safety features, kind of the future end state with zero knowledge technology, what would be the big thing that you would want people to either double click on or really take away from this podcast is like, like Wormhole. The foundation is doing something really unique and I need to get involved.
00:55:35.200 - 00:56:33.426, Speaker A: Yeah. First of all, I'd say on the one side, from a career perspective, I want to acknowledge, like, you know, maybe you and I can both acknowledge, like, we're blessed, right? But at the same time, you know, we work, we work hard to get where we're at, but you have to be comfortable taking risks. And I'd say particularly taking risks when you're young. And if you don't want to do that, there's also nothing wrong with that. But if you take enough risk and you focus and try a lot and dive deep into certain niches, it's very hard for you not to make any traction towards your goal. So it's the simple stuff, but I would say continue take risk when you're young and really, really try and dive in deep on certain topics and stay on niches, get really good at niches and then bridge from there once you're sufficient to a certain extent on the wormhole side. This is so cliche to say, but like, we truly are just getting started.
00:56:33.426 - 00:57:11.590, Speaker A: Like, we view wormal. We're starting to view wormal actually now in like a five to decade, five year to decade plus span. Like, how do you make this kind of immutable, long lasting protocol that like, you know, will be synonymous in a way with the Internet in some senses, for on chain. So there's a lot to think about. But we also are decentralizing the network. We don't believe that we should be the only decision makers in this kind of five year, decade plus vision. If anything, we actually believe Warvol is such a big public utility that there's more important to decentralize it and put in the hands of token holders.
00:57:11.590 - 00:57:39.600, Speaker A: So I would stay tuned on that front. I think that'll be a great way to get involved decision making on huge things like, you know, what, networks to expand, to contract, upgrades and honestly, so much more. So the best place to follow us is obviously on Twitter. We actually are pretty active with our blog as well. It can be really technical, which I think is a good thing. And we also describe things at a high level as well. So, yeah, those two media outlets I think would be great.
00:57:39.600 - 00:57:44.460, Speaker A: And yeah, if you're listening, feel free to dm me on Twitter if you have questions.
00:57:45.160 - 00:58:21.028, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, I think that was a beautiful podcast laying out. I don't know. We talked about it a lot. I mean, from the career side to ultimately what makes wormhole unique. I think truly in my mind, it is that execution coupled with the community side coupled with a useful product, and that combination of three things, especially within crypto, is very hard. And so, so really, kudos to you and the entire foundation labs team for getting this off the ground because it is no easy lift.
00:58:21.028 - 00:58:54.350, Speaker B: And I think, to your point, I would echo that it is early in the grand scheme of things. Prices perhaps can get excited up and down in each way. But the longer thing that I think we're ultimately all building for is that adoption of this technology that I think really can change the fabric of society, which has kind of pulled us all in. So, Robinson, thank you so much for coming on podcast. Thank you for sharing your journey. Wormhole foundation journey. It was a lot of fun.
00:58:54.730 - 00:58:56.610, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Logan. Looking forward to next time.
