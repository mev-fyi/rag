00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.416, Speaker A: I joined Polychain Capital. I was, I believe, the fourth or fifth full time employee there and spent about four years professionally investing in crypto. There's definitely a few principles that I took from the polychain experience that really influenced the way I thought of and what I wanted to do with Dao five. The first is create your own category. To some extent, the thinking on Dao five and part of our reason why I want to convert the fund ultimately into a DaO and decentralize the whole management decision making process. And kind of the game theory around incentives is really taking a page from Holly Chain's book, which was trying to create a new category. Granted, this is going to be a process that takes place over a period of time.
00:00:37.416 - 00:00:42.700, Speaker A: Today we look more like a traditional venture fund, and somewhere along the line, we're going to decentralize.
00:00:45.640 - 00:00:48.840, Speaker B: Thank you for coming over. Excited. We can do this in person.
00:00:48.960 - 00:00:50.408, Speaker A: Me too. Thank you for having me, Logan.
00:00:50.504 - 00:01:35.282, Speaker B: Appreciate it. I feel like you're a little bit behind the scenes in the crypto world, but you're doing a lot of huge things. Not only kind of in the investing world, even prior to starting your own fund, you even had the ambition to create a, ultimately get to a DaO for your investment fund. You're doing a lot of very interesting things. So very excited to parse apart all that. But a little bit before we kind of dive into the things, can you just introduce yourself to kind of the crypto community that does not know you and a little bit about what you actually do kind of in your day to day?
00:01:35.426 - 00:01:37.546, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And thank you again for having me.
00:01:37.578 - 00:01:38.106, Speaker B: Of course.
00:01:38.218 - 00:02:30.210, Speaker A: So in what feels like a completely prior life at this point, I was a corporate lawyer in Toronto, Canada, started paying attention to the Ethereum scene that was forming around there, and just got super immersed in the technology, super excited about what was happening with this movement. And around that time, the ICO bubble was taking off in 2017 and quickly realized that there was going to be a huge opportunity in this market. So the first thing I tried to do in crypto was basically build a legal practice around supporting this ICO work. So I brought in a few clients to the firm I was at at the time. We started doing kind of like general corporate work for these companies. And really quickly I realized that this was a bad idea and maybe one of the less interesting ways to participate in what was going to happen in this movement. So just quit my job without really having a plan and showed up to crypto conferences offering teams to help them.
00:02:30.210 - 00:02:44.456, Speaker A: Everything I could figure out how to do at that time, which was kind of like corporate structuring, legal, helping with fundraising, helping with taking advantage of tax credits in exchange for tokens in exchange for bitcoin, and was having fun just being scrappy.
00:02:44.648 - 00:03:18.018, Speaker B: So your previous kind of like college training was in the legal field, and ultimately, kudos to you for realizing maybe that's not exactly how you wanted to surf the wave. That vision kind of evolved. But even at that time, in 2017, that regulatory framework was still very hazy. I mean, today's 2024, and it's still not very clear on how at least the US is going to treat some of these digital assets.
00:03:18.194 - 00:04:01.228, Speaker A: Yeah, it was certainly hazy in those days, maybe less hazy. So, although not 2020 vision by any means, I do remember those early icos when basically you just had to check boxes that say, I recognize this is a donation. I recognize that I'll probably lose all my money. And I guess, like, the best knowledge at that point was that that's probably enough to comply with the various legal frameworks we've definitely evolved since then, but it was definitely interesting to be there early and pay attention to how this whole space has evolved. So around the time I left corporate law, I joined Polychain capital. I was, I believe, the fourth or fifth full time employee there and spent about four years professionally investing in crypto. We, yeah, learned a lot and kind of refined our thesis on the job.
00:04:01.228 - 00:04:29.026, Speaker A: And as the space matured, some of the waves we really caught were, I, I guess, the whole innovation and consensus alt l one wave of 2017 to 2019 or so, we were the biggest investors in some of those alternative ecosystems, like Polkadot, Cosmos, Dfinity, Tezos, et cetera, and then what I would call DeFi 1.0. So a lot of the first wave of DeFi platforms, before DeFi was even, like, the commonly adopted term. So I'm talking zero x makerdao.
00:04:29.178 - 00:04:29.906, Speaker B: I remember those.
00:04:29.938 - 00:04:49.828, Speaker A: Dydx. Yeah. And yeah, it was a great experience over four years at Polychain. I think when you're early to any startup, scaling is always a little bit bittersweet. And as we grew as a business and matured, I kind of wanted to return to that very early stage feel. So I left at the end of 2021 and launched my own fund, Dao five, at the beginning of 2022.
00:04:49.964 - 00:05:50.338, Speaker B: So I want to break apart all this, maybe just starting with what were some of the biggest learning lessons while at Polychain. Polychain, obviously a very prestigious fund. I think Olaf was one of the first crypto venture funds, definitely top five in terms of starting a crypto fund and being within the space. What were some of your big takeaways as the crypto industry was really just starting to mature, even with Ethereum through the ICO bubble in 2017? Kind of grinding it out, bitcoin Maxis making fun of Ethereum, kind of 2018 2019 defi summer happening. But then all these, as you mentioned, alternative layer one ecosystems, at least getting a lot of funding, maybe talking about some of your experiences, just what you learned as an investor going through kind of the ups and downs of the crypto industry.
00:05:50.514 - 00:06:52.748, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's a terrific question, and there's definitely a few principles that I took from the polychain experience that really influenced the way I thought of and what I wanted to do with Dao five. The first is create your own category. To some extent, I think that's much harder to do in some industries or technologies that have existed for many decades and have kind of been hardened and saturated as a market. With crypto, there's still so much undiscovered space and blue sky to explore. And just to put things in historic context, at the time when I joined polychain, there were a number of funds, or a handful of funds that would kind of take a traditional venture approach to investing in the equity of bitcoin startups, for instance. But the idea of creating a whole fund around repurposing the safe, which is like Y combinator's axiomatic form of contract, and then eventually framed the way all venture deals work over time into a new agreement specifically to buy prelaunch network tokens, that was a radically different idea than what existed before. It wasn't like the fifth fund that invested in equity of bitcoin companies.
00:06:52.748 - 00:07:23.014, Speaker A: It was the first fund that was truly crypto and token native. So the thinking on Dao five, and part of our reason why I want to convert the fund ultimately into a dao and decentralize the whole management decision making process. And kind of the game theory around incentives is really taking a page from polychain's book, which was trying to create a new category. Granted, this is going to be a process that takes place over a period of time. Today, we look more like a traditional venture fund, and somewhere along the line we're going to decentralize. But that is one of the biggest lessons, I think.
00:07:23.062 - 00:08:21.712, Speaker B: I mean, if anybody can go from like the more traditional fund structure to a dao, it would be you, just given your background, kind of illegal, and knowing how to kind of structure that. So bullish on the ability to switch the fund structure and ultimately how that would look. Because I think one of the interesting things to me and why I got really excited about Ethereum as well in like the 2017 timeframe, was that I, anybody could participate in the icos or initial coin offerings. That made it a little bit more democratic in terms of people being able to buy these tokens, where now it's gone to the traditional venture fund structure where you have to be accredited, certain network to get access to these tokens earlier, which to me is, is a little sad. And so the Dow model would be very interesting to explore.
00:08:21.896 - 00:09:22.726, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you touched on a lot of sensitive points for me in that point. I think even before I fully immersed into crypto as a corporate lawyer, I saw the limitations of kind of like security law, protections as we know them, and regulation D, for instance, where my early days as a corporate lawyer, I wasn't yet an accredited investor, so I wasn't considered smart enough to invest in certain things, although I understood them better than 99% of people, because I actually grappled with these rules. I did public disclosure work for public companies. So I do think that unfortunately, securities laws under the, I guess, guys, or to some extent the intention of protecting investors, do an incredible disservice to them at the point where you can't actually even like in a very compliant or safe way, airdrop tokens to us participants. And is it like, is this really protect investors or is this for some other reason? And I do believe strongly in the ICO and hope that we see some version of that back as a mechanism for capital formation and as democratizing access to early deals.
00:09:22.798 - 00:09:39.582, Speaker B: Yeah, we need it. I think it was one of that magical components of the blockchain industry is not only decentralizing power in terms of the underlying software systems, but ultimately economically, by allowing anybody to participate.
00:09:39.726 - 00:10:24.662, Speaker A: Yeah. And crypto, in one way of looking at it, is purely like this incentive machine, and it creates these incentives that long term are more aligned. And even if you look at some of the first era of like 2017, 2018 icos, a lot of them have held their value significantly better than maybe the next bull market wave of what you might argue as VC coins. And part of the reason is because it just did a better job giving retail upside. And not to make an argument that there shouldn't be any crypto VC's or anything like that, but I think there's a healthy balance of how much VC money versus retail participant money should go into a deal and how that should be constructed. We started maybe purely on the retail side, and now it feels far too skewed towards VC's where we're not at equilibrium.
00:10:24.766 - 00:10:50.892, Speaker B: I agree. So tell us a little bit more about Dao five. You said you wanted to really explore what you could do in kind of pushing this space forward, starting with a more traditional fund structure and then converting that into a DAO. But as a fund manager, what is kind of the goal? What projects are you ultimately looking for? What gets you excited, particularly about crypto today in 2024?
00:10:51.076 - 00:10:59.564, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. So an interesting lesson that I think we've had in crypto is not to too narrowly pigeonholed yourself into a thesis.
00:10:59.652 - 00:11:00.748, Speaker B: Maxis get slaughtered.
00:11:00.804 - 00:11:31.106, Speaker A: Yes, maxis get slaughtered. And history just makes us all look foolish over a long enough period of time. And in crypto, actually, in short cycles, just because the space moves so quickly. So I wouldn't call this Maxis in terms of investment thesis by any means. Today, we are fundamentally focused on crypto infrastructure. And I know that term can be thrown around a lot and mean almost everything and nothing at the same time, but to us, that just means innovative new technologies and protocols that just help the underlying performance of blockchain ecosystems. A lot of that being geared towards Ethereum today.
00:11:31.106 - 00:11:59.000, Speaker A: Although we're not ecosystem maxi, we're really just looking at where the innovation lives and where we're excited about communities that are forming. So that's been a lot in kind of like use case specific infrastructure, maybe to narrow that down more. So that could be l one s or l two s that are optimized for specific types of applications. Whereas if you look at the history of Ethereum and then the Alt L1 s that followed, a lot of those were designed deliberately to be very unopinionated in general. Uh, purpose.
00:11:59.420 - 00:12:50.744, Speaker B: Yeah, I it is very, it's fascinating. I mean, it's undeniable that Ethereum and the broader Ethereum community still remain at the heart of crypto. That and bitcoin. I mean, bitcoin, it's actually interesting with bitcoin now, because you're getting these l two s, you're getting ordinals. People are now experimenting with kind of bitcoin smart contracts, but I mean, that's relatively a new phenomenon. But ethereum enabling smart contracts, it really, outside of icos, was the birthplace for, I mean, I would say, most of the industry. With DeFi in 2020 taking off all the nfts, I was really surprised by the huge culture wave that nfts really brought in during 2021.
00:12:50.744 - 00:13:10.408, Speaker B: To me, it just made me a little bit sad that some of the scaling solutions were not up to par when we had our big moment in the day. But I'm very fascinated to see how the l two landscape, the high throughput blockchains, even polka dots, avalanches of the world, ultimately turn out.
00:13:10.584 - 00:13:55.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. It's going to be super interesting to watch it evolve. And the reality is these narratives and the way roadmaps are projected for lots of ecosystems continually change and have this element of revisionist history over time. And that goes to the earlier point of crypto moves very fast to some extent. Being very unopinionated about how infrastructure should evolve is the best foot forward as we kind of discover these use cases in the wild. Like Ethereum, first it was capital formation, right? Like icos were the first use case that really took off, that was enabled. It led a lot of standards that form the industry today, like ERC 20, and then DeFi being the next big use case that kind of found emergence leading up to nfts and other assets like that.
00:13:55.480 - 00:14:05.020, Speaker A: I think that it's interesting to learn on the job and then kind of like evolve these infrastructures to suitcase certain use cases over time as they kind of develop.
00:14:05.360 - 00:14:53.410, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm very curious just to see how it plays out. I remember being really fascinated by Ethereum in 2017, predominantly because of the vision at the time, was kind of like banking the unbanked, getting excited about kind of a bank account anywhere in the world, like giving first world like DeFi to like these third world countries. And it's been a little bit slow. It is possible. I think the industry is starting to find its footing. Certainly it's gotten a lot of venture dollars in to help scale the industry, try different experiments. But it's kind of funny.
00:14:53.410 - 00:15:13.976, Speaker B: Every bear market we come back to, it's like, all right, what did we build? What has your lessons been as an investor? Going through the bull markets and the bear markets, and then every time we have a bear markets, people are like, what are we doing in the industry? And what applications do we actually have to show for it?
00:15:14.168 - 00:16:08.520, Speaker A: Yeah, great question. I think with every cycle you will see kind of a micro boom and bust in some type of use case or some specific application. So one example being like play to earn maybe was the genesis of that was axie infinity. I don't know if I believe in Axie Infinity as a game purely long term, but I do think it scratched the surface on something that is possible, which is as an application, hyper accelerating incentives to onboard and use something with some constructed economic model, where by using the application, you earn a new token from a value. So I think there's some first mover disadvantage, right? Like, people who do this first don't really know. They're completely navigating into uncharted territory. It's easy to get it wrong, but in each of these cycles, you study what was right and what was wrong, I think you can construct more coherent versions of these things in the next cycle.
00:16:08.520 - 00:16:19.220, Speaker A: So I'm paying attention to the early use cases of crypto social that maybe had a micro boom and bust, early use cases of crypto gaming from the last cycle, and even pfps to some extent.
00:16:20.520 - 00:17:07.940, Speaker B: So you mentioned kind of like capital formation a couple times. Can you kind of walk us through some of your thoughts around, just like, crypto's unique advantage of capital formation? Because definitely would echo those sentiments. Once you have new ways to either coordinate humans or coordinate capital, you get some really interesting outcomes, whether that was 2017 with icos, or kind of liquidity mining, that compound kicked off for DeFi summer and all the food tokens that went on during that period, or even, I think today, my guess is we're going to enter a new wave within 2024. Deep end being among that, maybe perhaps gaming. What are your thoughts on kind of these incentives for capital formation within the industry?
00:17:08.320 - 00:17:59.718, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. My starting principle is that capital formation in the traditional equities market, for instance, is fundamentally broken. I understand the principle of wanting to protect investors from fraud. I think that is something worth pursuing, and there are avenues to achieving that. However, I would argue the inherent costs that are built into doing any type of IPO in an american stock market or major market stock market, the fact that you have to draft a prospectus, this countless legal hours, accounting hours, management hours, go into this process. I don't know if ever in history, like a retail investor, has read a prospectus for an offering and decided to invest or not to invest based on some narrow point in there. I think that this is a whole industry that is propped up to really facilitate and value the service providers, not protect investors by and large.
00:17:59.718 - 00:18:41.622, Speaker A: And I fundamentally believe that using the Internet and using smart contracts and this technology, you can create very efficient, very egalitarian capital formation. Now, there definitely needs to be mechanisms to protect investors from fraud. I think at one level, we just have to change the culture of investing. This idea that there is this nanny state that's going to protect you from making a bad deal, and with the benefit of hindsight, if you get it, wrong, you're allowed to go complain and sue someone. That kind of needs to change and evolve to do your own research and do your own diligence. But at the same time, I do think there's also private market solutions that could pop up, like research firms and proxy firms that people rely on to underwrite different icos or different projects. There are better solutions than what exists today.
00:18:41.726 - 00:19:12.968, Speaker B: Yeah. And the fact that, I mean, even so, the vast majority of the world does not have access to us markets, that there is really not a global market that we can evaluate things kind of makes me sad as well. It's funny just how finance historically has been so isolated from the disruptions of the Internet and blockchains, for better or worse, kind of bring that forward, the good and the bad and the ugly.
00:19:13.144 - 00:19:58.734, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely like a barbell, where it attracts the best and the worst people. It has, like, the most positively reinforcing, but also extremely negative incentives. And it makes me sometimes wonder about how cryptos are fundamentally religions at some level. And it comes with these very emotionally charged, strong opinions where you don't often see an uber user that has very emotionally charged opinions about Lyft or something like that, whereas you look at competing l one communities. And I kind of try to assess where that comes from to some extent, another ecosystem that you view as a competitor or within the same market. It's not just like an alternative idea. It's almost an attack on your financial well being and your livelihood.
00:19:58.734 - 00:20:06.950, Speaker A: And there's a real cost to, like, divesting what you have and adopting this new platform, which is why we get these, like, interesting, fervorous arguments on Twitter.
00:20:07.070 - 00:21:04.664, Speaker B: It is crazy. I mean, lots of. Lots of debates. I always love them talking with a lot of the engineering minds in the space, but it's kind of. I don't know, it's like if we all bought, like, Toyota and, like, Volkswagen stock, and we're, like, arguing which car. And so I think to that point, though, like, going back to kind of capital formation, it's really extremely helpful just to have that community aspect behind it and getting people kind of bought into your vision, not only kind of from a theoretical perspective, but monetary perspective and how much that really supercharges the projects, the community. I mean, it can supercharge it, but can also break down a community when it goes in the opposite direction.
00:21:04.792 - 00:21:51.404, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's a very good point. It's interesting to kind of, like, philosophize on the intersection of culture and money. Like, what part does having a cohesive culture shared amongst some hegemonist group play in creating value or stickiness to like your financial asset. Obviously, in the crypto world, we see this in memes. There are more memes about crypto communities or within crypto communities than you'd see in any public company context. For instance, it's not like, maybe with the exception of Tesla, most other companies. And I think that's just a super fascinating emergent behavior about this new financial asset that we're really just scratching the surface and understanding, and our best understanding of how to value these things, how to classify them amongst other financial assets, evolves every few years, and I think we'll continue to do so for a while.
00:21:51.492 - 00:22:22.664, Speaker B: Yeah, so looking out today, the narrative has still really been around. Ethereum, kind of the l two roadmap, some of the upcoming upgrades. From a technical perspective, Solana has been doing fairly well. When you kind of put your investor hat on and look forward towards like 2024, 2025, what things are you excited about? From the infrastructure aspect, sure.
00:22:22.712 - 00:23:28.652, Speaker A: So some of the things we've been investing in but are yet to ship and I think are going to form our understanding of the next wave is probably some of these isolated execution environments. So thinking about groups like eclipse that are bringing the Solana VM to a modular environment in Ethereum movement labs, doing the same with the move VM, I think giving users and smart contract writers the ability to deploy in any of these ecosystems, while still maybe being more agnostic to where the underlying consensus comes from or what l one it's tied to is going to be interesting. Also the ability for a community within those execution environments to a microform of governance, decide on changing parameters or upgrading the protocol. It would be much harder to do that and change the EVM within Ethereum than it would be to change an EVM deployment in some l two, I think that more experimentation will be enabled by this then other types of network designs that again, as I mentioned before, are really geared towards specific use cases. So Barachain for instance, being designed as like an l one, purely optimized for.
00:23:28.676 - 00:24:19.850, Speaker B: Defi with Neil and Eclipse and Rushi for movement. I think funny enough for me, just very much appreciating parallel processing. I personally view them as the best l two s. I know they don't have kind of maybe proof chat or kind of the ZK magic which eventually they could add down the line, but really having that parallel processing, having localized fee markets, I'm really excited about them. I think from the I wish I'm curious just to see if like the Ethereum developers ultimately move over and like rewrite their applications on those, or if they'll just be new engineers that come into the ecosystem and try out those, because I do think they're the best l two s today.
00:24:20.150 - 00:24:47.672, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's a good point. And really what I'm excited about is letting users vote with their capital and developers vote with their time and energy of where they deploy contracts without creating this prerequisite of these teams like movement labs and eclipse to bootstrap their whole consensus layer from ground zero and create a decentralized blockchain. I think being able to piggyback on what ethereum's accomplished, but provided these isolated environments is an interesting part of how infrastructure will be developed.
00:24:47.816 - 00:24:57.992, Speaker B: Yeah. Giving developers the maximum flexibility to choose what works for them, what doesn't work, and if I mean, kind of more choice the better.
00:24:58.136 - 00:25:23.182, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. And to my earlier point, again with use case specificity, I think there's other constructions like what Barachain is doing in their rewritten consensus model. Proof of liquidity. That is super interesting. Barachain, for context, was born out of om. It kind of like started in the battles of the ohm ecosystem, which is why it's so meme y and like really captivates that Degen traitor culture.
00:25:23.246 - 00:25:31.606, Speaker B: I didn't know it was legit for the longest time, and then I just saw them like raise more and more money. I'm like, what is going on? I thought it was a meme for the longest time.
00:25:31.798 - 00:25:50.040, Speaker A: Yeah, it definitely captures the like left brain and right brain part of the thesis of like, it's kind of like real tech wrapped in a meme coin, which I think is super interesting, but again, returns to that point about culture and how important culture is in creating sticky communities. Yeah, that's one that we are really paying attention to.
00:25:50.120 - 00:25:59.528, Speaker B: So you mentioned they're kind of customized for Defi. Could you go into that a little bit more on their custom stack or what gets you excited about burger chain?
00:25:59.624 - 00:26:47.516, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the observation and the insight came from what we experienced in Defi 2.0. And there was real innovation. And I think people have strong opinions about ohm and Olympus, whether they like it or hate it, or thought it was a pure ponzi, or like this really novel construction like protocol owned liquidity. I think that there were things that it definitely got right, but what we experienced in DeFi 2.0 is just very, very mercenary capital that was floating from food token to food token to farm as much of the liquidity as possible of this new governance coin, kind of like dump it and move on to. And although that is free market behavior, I think it's a little bit of a market failure where the whole space would benefit from stickier liquidity. How do we captivate this liquidity? Incentivize it long term to stay within these same platforms so you can have sustainable markets.
00:26:47.516 - 00:27:05.724, Speaker A: And Barachain's innovation is basically decoupling gas from the governance network token. So on day one, investors in Barachain, like myself, will have to stake all of their capital in the native amm. The native lending pools basically lp your money in order to earn the governance token.
00:27:05.892 - 00:27:11.284, Speaker B: Interesting. So what is the gas token for Bara?
00:27:11.452 - 00:27:33.500, Speaker A: It's called bera, and then you mint BGT, which is a governance coin, and BGT holders effectively get to vote on where emissions go. It's like you vote with your stake on what is the best use of capital. Should more of the emissions go towards people who deposit in the amm? Should it go towards lending market, some other Defi app, and it's basically all enshrined at the protocol layer.
00:27:34.040 - 00:28:31.732, Speaker B: Interesting. And I do think capital has, to your point, been extremely mercenary, going from highest yield to highest yield. I'm very curious what will stop this? Maybe it's bear chain, maybe it's useful applications. I think at the end of the day, I really want infrastructure to enable unique things. And it sounds like Barachain is taking a step in that direction, decoupling gas token from governance, trying to incentivize the liquidity to be there. But I am very excited just for applications to take advantage of that liquidity on whether it's bear chain or ethereum, Solana, etcetera. Because it seems like we are still in the early days, even though there has been a lot of experimentation.
00:28:31.916 - 00:29:13.612, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. And some network designs just aren't really friendly to this idea. So, like in the early days of Ethereum, a lot of people pointed out this obvious like, behavioral game theory issue, where basically every dollar that you put into staking, if you can earn a higher yield in DeFi, you're strongly incentivized to like remove your capital from staking in network security and going towards DeFi. But you kind of create these inverse issues where every dollar that goes into defi that is taken out of staking is compromising security more and more, and the vice versa. It's like every dollar that if the yield is higher in staking, you pull out a defi to put into staking. You limit the liquidity on the platforms on Defi. Yeah.
00:29:13.612 - 00:29:38.750, Speaker A: Barachain is one approach to this and to tie it back to your main point, you're right. What's ultimately going to be interesting is the applications that enable users to access liquidity or contribute to Defi. Part of the reason I think this has been so limited is a lot of companies that want to build on top of crypto and build in the application layer. It's so hard to pick what stack you're going to build on top of because there's so much platform risk.
00:29:41.970 - 00:30:17.360, Speaker B: Where do you see that going? Because I don't see it from really getting easier for an engineer to choose. There's multiple l two s, there's multiple l one's. Everybody kind of has a knife fight to say I'm the best chain historically, and even today, majority of the liquidity lives on Ethereum L1, but the gas fees get super high. Where do you think like the end game is for like either the infrastructure or applications as one chain one l, two just start to take off and everybody coalesce there.
00:30:17.800 - 00:30:22.512, Speaker A: Yeah, I think these meta protocols or middleware is going to play a big part of that.
00:30:22.576 - 00:30:23.576, Speaker B: Like Eigen layers.
00:30:23.688 - 00:30:51.076, Speaker A: Yeah, Eigen layers. But also if you think of like the Defi example, there's a lot of APIs that'll just pull the best execution or the best liquidity. You can create these incentives to create like a market for a type of participant that whoever can resolve your trade from like chain a to chain b most effectively will do that for the underlying app developer. Hopefully they don't have to think about where the liquidity comes from or how they're going to source it, but they just rely on these middleware protocols.
00:30:51.188 - 00:30:57.692, Speaker B: So more abstraction with bridges or whatever mechanics to just interconnect at all.
00:30:57.836 - 00:31:08.800, Speaker A: Yeah, effectively I think that's going to be a necessary component to adopting just more web two style app developers to build fintech app on top of crypto, a social app that uses crypto, et cetera.
00:31:09.330 - 00:31:44.600, Speaker B: It is infrastructure is funny. Like there's a billion rabbit holes to go down. And I think that's why we started frictionless, just because it is a rather endless maze that you can go down a lot in. I'm excited that hopefully we're getting to the point that infrastructure is maturing and we can start going up to the application layer. And it seems like at the application layer today, the hottest narrative, whether crypto or non crypto, is AI. Do you have any thoughts on the AI crypto synergies.
00:31:45.100 - 00:32:28.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's an area we spent a lot of time thinking about, and it's a tough one because usually I don't like when crypto is trying to also chase the other area of tech that's maybe the most buzziest or forming a bubble around it. But fundamentally, there should be some really interesting mechanisms or infrastructure developments that make sense at the nexus of the two. A lot of folks are thinking about, like ZK machine learning, using DPIn as a mechanism to train models, run inference on models, as we have like, effectively a compute shortage today for this. I think all of those ideas are interesting. We've mostly been researching and not investing actively, although we are big investors in bittencer, which is a project we started tracking super early.
00:32:28.838 - 00:32:37.670, Speaker B: Nice. Can you share any more about just your general thoughts with bent tensor and why Dao five is excited about it?
00:32:37.830 - 00:33:14.448, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So also, to put this one into context, we started getting involved in bittencer in kind of like late 2020, early 2021. We were in the Discord channel when it was like low hundreds of people and largely an AI community and not so crypto native. And this is pre chat. GPT right. Although there was a lot of research and obviously capital rushing towards AI, it wasn't really the AI hype bubble we're in yet. And it was becoming very apparent already that AI was trending in this direction where if you look at it as an industry or like a collective set of incentives, it was diametrically opposed to crypto.
00:33:14.448 - 00:33:47.510, Speaker A: Crypto is open source, it's super open and collaborative. You have offshoots of experimentation. Whereas AI felt very siloed with both talent, intellectual property, machine intelligence. If there wasn't some disruptive force, it almost felt like all of the effective machine intelligence would live within a handful of companies, handful of nation states. And Bittensor kind of came from this observation that we need an open alternative to this. There isn't much that's actually open about OpenAI. For instance, like the web, two equivalents weren't really cutting it.
00:33:47.510 - 00:33:57.952, Speaker A: And Bittensor creates a set of incentives to collaborate and share machine intelligence. That's obviously a simplification, but it was really the incentive mechanism that we were excited about.
00:33:58.056 - 00:34:02.920, Speaker B: I'm impressed you're getting down and dirty in the discord communities.
00:34:03.040 - 00:34:37.570, Speaker A: Yeah, for that one, we definitely had to. Bittencer was entirely a fair launch coin, meaning there was no pre mine. I think the design of the token economics was meant to largely mirror bitcoin, so even the founders, like the core team, had to mine from day one. And we just basically dove into the Discord channels and approached miners individually before there was a single exchange listing and offered them to buy tokens. OTC. It took us several months, like almost a year to build up our position and really just kind of like picking a price out of the air and offering, but happy with how that's turned out. Definitely.
00:34:37.650 - 00:35:08.529, Speaker B: That's very impressive. It's funny still, like how early we still are, kind of given that some of these marketplaces aren't spin up or they're not automatically added to like a DAX or an amm, and you kind of have to do like the discord negotiations. It's impressive nonetheless, for bittensor particularly. Are they focused more on the hardware aspect, like the machine learning aspect, inference training, or kind of the entire gamut?
00:35:08.569 - 00:35:59.436, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. The infrastructure bit tensor today, I think the chain is built using substrate, which is like parity's SDK, and it's basically comprised of 32 individual subnets, each of which does something entirely different within the AI landscape. So to your question, it kind of is all of them. And I think the coherence between how these different subnets complement one another is something that's rapidly evolving. For instance, there's one subnet that's just a wrapper on GPT four. You can generate synthetic data by querying it and then use that synthetic data like in the fine tuning subnet, which is another subnet within bittensor to fine tune your model. The data can all be stored within a storage subnet, so it's kind of like a one stop shop for all things ML problems, AI problems, but it's still hyper experimental.
00:35:59.436 - 00:36:04.340, Speaker A: And I think the cohesion between these different subnets or departments will improve over time.
00:36:04.420 - 00:36:15.700, Speaker B: And is the decentralization aspect or like bitten sir token trying to just incentivize the community aspect or what is the relation to it all?
00:36:16.040 - 00:37:00.306, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's governance. Like if you. You need to stake a certain amount of it to control a subnet and then you earn rewards by controlling that subnet. And yeah, it does also play a part in towards contributing intelligence to the system. So there's a relationship where basically validators weight the responses, or the inputs of miners and then vote or contribute capital based on how useful the responses are. It's all hyper experimental when you consider what Ethereum looks like, what bitcoin looks like, but again, where we get super excited is not really picking apart details that we think are wrong. Kind of like suspending disbelief and just assuming that if there's something innovative enough happening here and there's a strong community of smart people forming around it.
00:37:00.306 - 00:37:17.326, Speaker A: A lot of these issues are short term and will be solved fundamentally. And it just felt like a totally organic and radically new community of people. It wasn't like people who trickled away from bitcoin to ethereum and now we're trickling from Ethereum to Bittensor, but it was actually captivating a lot of organic AI talent.
00:37:17.478 - 00:37:28.406, Speaker B: And if we ever stop running these experimentations, we know we should probably stop moving or stop investing in crypto and move somewhere else, because that's when innovation dies 100%.
00:37:28.478 - 00:37:49.714, Speaker A: And also when your community is starting to become maxi, that's when you should really think of divesting and migrating capital. And you see it as communities mature, it's like they start to get entrenched and the incentives change. It's like you start to really just bet against innovation in other places if it's not happening in your ecosystem. And it's like a toxic culture that can compound over time.
00:37:49.802 - 00:38:38.616, Speaker B: I agree. Yeah, it's interesting. I think yesterday or two days ago, Nvidia just surpass Amazon's market cap. I think even Google. And just how prominent kind of this AI wave is coming, like becoming with chat GPT with like the hardware shortage and then even with like deepfakes trying to prove, hey, did I actually create this or did I sign this? The intersection between crypto in AI seems inevitable at the very least. Just like proving that you generated a photo or a video from your device and this is actually a legitimate device as these deepfakes become greater and greater.
00:38:38.768 - 00:39:12.122, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. I think the trust layer is going to be very important in AI already. The kind of like core premise of machine learning is as a user, if you query a model, you need some guarantees that the query was run correctly through the correct model. And all of that can potentially result in data leakage. So you need some encryption mechanism, you need a succinctness to it to post it on chain. I think that trust layer will be really important for crypto. The other thing is one of the most interesting thing AI's can do over time is transact for you.
00:39:12.122 - 00:39:23.660, Speaker A: Right? Like abstract away a lot of financial tasks that individuals have. I think it's more likely that that'll be adopted on a common platform based in crypto than it is like over swift or Ach or something like that.
00:39:23.810 - 00:39:32.860, Speaker B: So like AI agents. Yeah, basically I haven't dug into this too much. Where do you kind of see that future heading towards?
00:39:33.400 - 00:39:57.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I just think of it like, from a user's perspective myself, I would love a chat GPT plugin that helps me write emails. I think that'll create a lot of efficiency, but I probably even more than that, just want something that abstracts away paying, like, TD's common bills. I spend so much time doing that. I'm sure a lot of people do. And I think within certain dollar constraints, you'd probably trust an AI agent to do that for you.
00:39:57.980 - 00:40:54.510, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it was funny. I used to work at Expedia Group, and one of the things that we would have loved to do is just say, hey, find me a four star hotel in Miami tonight and give you some recommendations. I think now with chat GPT, with these language models, with the neural networks becoming larger and larger, we are just now getting to the point where it's almost conversational, where its results are actually useful, where you could take the recommendation of the AI engine and, I mean, fast forward, like ten years. It's very easy to imagine a world where you're having very fluid conversations. Your AI agent is very personalized for you. It can pay your bills. And if majority of the world is kind of powered by this crypto backend for financial rails or even just your own digital assets, they're definitely colliding.
00:40:54.970 - 00:41:07.122, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's an exciting and brave new world that we're heading into. Yeah. At some point we could do this whole interview with just the Logan LLM speaking to the tech and LLM and abstract it all the way from us.
00:41:07.146 - 00:41:39.620, Speaker B: But so one thing that you also mentioned, just as Dao five, an area that you're excited about, was kind of this decentralized social. I think we've seen early iterations of this with, like, friendtech, now, like Farcaster being able to kind of own some of your data on chain. Farcaster started to take off. Rentek had like, it's like light and day. Where do you see that space progressing to?
00:41:40.600 - 00:42:22.310, Speaker A: Yeah. So we started paying attention to crypto social in 2021. I personally spent a lot of time just playing with bit clout, which is now Deso. And I think, again, to my earlier point, like, you learn with what goes wrong in certain applications or in certain contexts about how to approach it in the next cycle. And I think that the first wave of crypto social apps spent way too much time and money trying to onboard influencers from other contexts. Whereas if you actually look at the history of successful social mediums, they kind of create their own native culture and native celebrity. It's like Facebook didn't win over MySpace by going and incentivizing all of the biggest MySpace creators to migrate over.
00:42:22.310 - 00:43:04.412, Speaker A: And you see with Snapchat, with Vine, with all of these new platforms, they have their own local celebrity and local culture. So I like that farcaster and the current wave like lens. And these protocols are mostly focusing on crypto as an ecosystem itself. Like, let's captivate crypto Twitter first, and then think about onboarding the celebrities from other contexts. And I think we're doing a much better job at that now with Friendtech. I think it obviously took learning lessons from bit cloud, probably the biggest being don't make the bonding curve so aggressive and don't lock the capital within the system. And really the breakthrough for that application was how seamless it was to onboard and download and how easy it was to use.
00:43:04.412 - 00:43:09.564, Speaker A: Didn't require complex knowledge of how to create wallets and manage keys and stuff like that.
00:43:09.732 - 00:44:00.446, Speaker B: Yeah, looking back and some of those early social networks that I joined, whether it was like the early days of YouTube, they definitely had their own unique creator. And it wasn't like they were trying to steal creators from other ecosystems. It was just like, here's a new platform or a new capability, whether it's video or Instagram, with just like a photo wall, like native communities form with that native celebrities. And you kind of have this new rush even with TikTok. So it's not too hard to imagine that crypto or crypto social will kind of mirror similar things to what happened there.
00:44:00.558 - 00:44:43.856, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. And even like part of the reason historically that social media businesses, the successful ones, have been so defensible and strong is the activation energy of moving from one platform to another is extremely high. It makes it difficult to win users from an existing platform. But one of the magical parts of cryptosocial is as you build these things on protocols that are open and permissionless, you can actually just start to aggregate posts and data across different platforms into a single application. Reminds me a little bit of the threaded inbox in BlackBerry. If you remember, you'd go to one place and see a Facebook message, an email, a text message in a single inbox. I think there's a certain amount of composability value that comes with that.
00:44:43.968 - 00:45:02.504, Speaker B: That would be super cool, because then you can tailor your algorithm, you can tailor the UI and plug and play, you have the data on the back end, you can swap out the user interface and customize it towards your liking, similar to what you could do with your own neural network agent.
00:45:02.672 - 00:45:35.268, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe if we had this discussion three years ago, most people wouldn't see the need of why you'd want to do this or why it matters what platform you're on. I think we kind of as a culture, at least in the US, hit a breaking point on the politicization of these different mediums. Censorship and content moderation policies are at all time high in terms of importance and how users think about what platform they want to be on. And crypto makes sense. It makes sense to have a governance token. Leave this to some subset community that votes with stake and can decide these things on the fly.
00:45:35.404 - 00:46:39.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm excited. It is something that is needed. I think even the work that the Solana community has been doing with trying to break up the duopoly with both of the Google App Store, the Apple App Store, and allow more crypto native apps. When you combine that with the unleashing of new applications directly built for phone that are crypto native with kind of these decentralized social, you can see how like all these pieces, although painfully slow coming together, they are coming together. And I think we're just now getting to the inflection point where the infrastructure is there, building unique applications is there. You can start to do some of the more composable aspects with decentralized social. So it's exciting as an investor, a builder, or even just a participant within these crypto networks.
00:46:39.900 - 00:47:06.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think the ability for any outsize market or government to censor this industry as a whole with more robust DPIn, it gets stronger and stronger in terms of our protection. The Solana phone, to some extent is an extension of that. It is kind of like a decentralized form of D PiN where I as an industry, we can control our own app store and not be kind of pigeonholed by the content moderation policies or app store rules of another tech giant.
00:47:06.690 - 00:47:11.350, Speaker B: We're slowly taking over every industry one by one.
00:47:11.690 - 00:47:12.710, Speaker A: I love it.
00:47:13.130 - 00:47:40.548, Speaker B: I know you're also very passionate just about privacy. Some of the things that are going on with that tech. It seems now that crypto is in its HTTP phase, where it doesn't have like encryption, all transactions are public on the blockchain. If you want to do payroll or even pay back a friend that is a little bit too public sometimes, can you talk about your views on privacy and where that is going for the industry?
00:47:40.724 - 00:48:41.146, Speaker A: Yeah. It's also funny because if you ask an outsider, like, they assume bitcoin is used because it's this entirely private thing, where in reality it's actually far more transparent than the protections they have using the legacy financial system. But for any entity to ultimately want to transact in crypto in a real way, as a business, if you want to pay your employees or contractors on a crypto network, if you want to trade as a fund, the fact that this is entirely transparent makes it almost like unusable in an industry where your competitors can track, you, can front run your decisions, can do things like that. So privacy is a very essential component, but for better or worse, it's been held back a lot, and that's largely due to regulation. It's due to this kind of social perception that if you have nothing to fear, you have nothing to hide kind of thing. I think that's obviously historically been proven to be a huge fallacy. And the way the laws around building privacy tech have trended are really regressive.
00:48:41.146 - 00:49:16.620, Speaker A: I think there needs to be a better approach to it. But I'm happy and kind of like invigorated by the fact that there still is a ton of privacy innovation and research going on on multiple fronts too. It's not like a single tech approach. There's a number of great teams working on fully homomorphic encryption. There's obviously ZK protocols or ZK proof protocols, both used as a form of privacy, but also scalability within Ethereum. There are early experiments in trusted execution environments, and I think all of these endeavors are worthwhile and are going to play a part of building this composable privacy set for blockchains.
00:49:16.920 - 00:49:37.820, Speaker B: Yeah, we need it. I think it is a little frustrating that everything has to be public. These are public ledgers. They should be verifiable. But it doesn't mean that you still can't have your privacy until your point. Just because you're not trying to hide anything doesn't mean you shouldn't have privacy.
00:49:38.370 - 00:50:10.704, Speaker A: Yeah, and like, obviously the most recent or the most top of mind legal issues are probably around tornado cash. That would come to mind. When you think of what's holding back privacy tech, what debate is taking place in the background? And it's undeniable that tornado cash has been used for money laundering, for criminal activity. But to punish the whole platform, or the premise of privacy tech because of a small subset of bad actors, it just doesn't make any sense. Right? The biggest medium or financial asset in money laundering is the us dollar.
00:50:10.752 - 00:50:12.872, Speaker B: I was about to say, I mean, we're not banning cash.
00:50:12.976 - 00:50:31.876, Speaker A: Correct? Correct. Or banning the Internet. All of these things are abused by a subset. Every technology is abused by some subset of bad actors, but it's just very intellectually dishonest to be, like, all privacy tech has to stop, or you punish a person who writes open source software for what the north korean government decides to do with it.
00:50:32.008 - 00:51:01.130, Speaker B: Agreed. I think privacy is much needed. I'm excited that there are different solutions. You mentioned ZK, the encryption aspect, and then ultimately these untrusted kind of setups. Can you talk about, like, are you kind of equally bullish, all of them being a little bit more agnostic, or do you have kind of an opinion on what you think is going to be, like, the fastest horse?
00:51:03.470 - 00:51:38.100, Speaker A: Ultimately, I don't know where I think from purely an unopinionated investors standpoint, it's good to have exposure to privacy tech like a portfolio, like you would with other assets. So I want to bet on the best teams that are building in each. I do think within that there will be subsets of things you can solve using one technology where you can't with another. For instance, like zero knowledge. Probably doesn't make sense to solve for malicious mev, but fully homomorphic, or. Sorry, yeah, fully homomorphic encryption could theoretically do this. So I think there will be certain things and certain types of privacy and different contexts enabled by each makes sense.
00:51:39.360 - 00:53:21.480, Speaker B: I'm excited for each of them. I think it's just an exciting time to be in crypto, because I think throughout 2022, we had the Luna crash, all the stuff that happened with FTX, that was extremely painful. And again, everybody kind of questioned the industry, what are we doing? And these boom and bust periods are often more served as like, a self reflection than anything. And now that we're coming into or are in kind of like the first half of 2024, there's life not only kind of on scaling aspects, but privacy, the AI synergies, even new things, experiments being run with daos, it's an exciting future that I think was kind of the original vision that got me into crypto with kind of along the lines of Ethereum, like banking, the unbank, trying experiments, and really pushing forward the innovation. And I think the thing that I've always loved about the industry was the fact that you could have a laptop and participate. You didn't need $100 million of gpu's to train a neural network. And so, yeah, really just appreciative of you and kind of your thoughts and pushing the industry forward from not only the fun structure with Dao five, and ultimately progressing towards a Dao, but your thoughts and being a expert in the industry for as long as you have.
00:53:21.820 - 00:54:08.756, Speaker A: Yeah, I appreciate that, man. And likewise, you're definitely on the front lines as well and playing your part in it. And I agree, there's lots of things to be excited about in crypto, lots of ways to look at it. But fundamentally, to me, the reason why I want to do this and continue to do it long term is I just think it provides a lot of sovereignty to the individual over time. In a world right now where the average person doesn't find a lot of hope or ability to access what are very defended saturated markets already. It's very hard to find economic mobility in today's world, and maybe that's a feature or bug of late stage capitalism, but crypto definitely doesn't feel that way. In fact, the better these systems are constructed, the more of an entry and access point they have for the regular person.
00:54:08.756 - 00:54:42.964, Speaker A: So things like fair launches, all you needed was a raspberry PI or whatever mining spec they had in bittensortain. Show up in a discord and you can ride that whole wave up. I get very excited about privacy also because of the individual data context. Right now, there's huge data issues with a lot of tech platforms, a lot of different products that you use. I've been recently paying attention to the fall in price of the market cap of 23 andme. 23 andme has the genomics data of twelve or 13 million americans.
00:54:43.012 - 00:54:45.876, Speaker B: I never did it because I was sus of what they were going to do with the data.
00:54:45.948 - 00:55:09.472, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. On my desk for like a year, as I decided. But ultimately, there will be a product that's an equivalent of that, where you can still lend your data to train a model, but it'll be fully encrypted, you will own it, and you will capture the financial benefit for that. Creating these like data markets for individuals, another way for the average person to monetize and contribute to a greater whole. These are the new markets that I'm super excited about and are uniquely enabled.
00:55:09.496 - 00:55:21.928, Speaker B: By crypto, the sovereign individual. I think as the world becomes a little bit more disjointed, but we are becoming more connected, it's important to have the technologies to enable that sovereignty.
00:55:22.064 - 00:55:25.220, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very inspirational point to close on.
00:55:25.520 - 00:55:54.084, Speaker B: Well, Tekin, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Thank you for doing this in person and being flexible with me while setting everything up. Really enjoyed the conversation. I hope the people listening to this really find a lot of value and kind of how you're thinking about it, because you are really an expert that has been in the industry through the ups and downs, the highs and lows and has thought a lot about where the industry is going. So thank you again.
00:55:54.172 - 00:55:54.500, Speaker A: Thank you.
