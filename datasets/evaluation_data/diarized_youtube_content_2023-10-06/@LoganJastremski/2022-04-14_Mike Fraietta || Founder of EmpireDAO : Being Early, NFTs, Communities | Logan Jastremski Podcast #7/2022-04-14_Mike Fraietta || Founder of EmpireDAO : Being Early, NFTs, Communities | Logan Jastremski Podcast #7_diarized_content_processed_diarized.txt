00:00:00.400 - 00:00:03.142, Speaker A: All right, cool. We're live. Thanks for doing this, Mike.
00:00:03.206 - 00:00:04.486, Speaker B: Yeah, no, thanks for having me. This is great.
00:00:04.558 - 00:00:13.358, Speaker A: I appreciate it. Yeah, no, I've really enjoyed kind of the podcast journey. I think each one's getting slightly better. So this one's going to be the best one yet.
00:00:13.414 - 00:00:15.170, Speaker B: That's what. Yet until the next one.
00:00:16.350 - 00:00:31.212, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think what I've kind of been doing on like, a high level is just starting off with guests in their background and their journey into crypto, because everybody's journey is a little bit unique. Yeah. So why don't you start there?
00:00:31.356 - 00:00:55.324, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, it goes way back, I would say. I started, it's 1995, picture of the year, and me and some buddies, we started a fantasy football league in our high school. So on Monday mornings we get the newspaper out and do the scores. But we did it with money. Right? So we did it with a shared account. So we had a shared interest at community with a bank account.
00:00:55.324 - 00:00:58.636, Speaker B: Right. So essentially a dow is like, you know what we were doing back then.
00:00:58.708 - 00:00:58.956, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:58.988 - 00:01:05.976, Speaker B: And it's kind of been running online community ever since then. But, like, really with crypto, I got in around 2014 with bitcoin, and then.
00:01:06.008 - 00:01:07.000, Speaker A: That's super early.
00:01:07.120 - 00:01:13.240, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, relatively speaking, you know. Yeah. You're always. Doesn't matter how early you are, you always think like, oh, wow, it could have been in 2011.
00:01:13.360 - 00:01:14.620, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:01:15.600 - 00:01:30.018, Speaker B: And I started doing more research and became fascinated with it. And it opened up so many doors, my mind to how everything operates. Not just bitcoin, but all of our man made ecosystems that we're doing here.
00:01:30.074 - 00:01:30.378, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:30.434 - 00:01:52.888, Speaker B: So that gave me the freedom to go, wow, all this stuff's really kind of made up. It's. It gave me, you know, freedom to make stuff up on my own. And what really happened, I guess, took off, was I had a startup in 2019, 2020 and 2021 came around and we were struggling with the financial pipes, so we were using all the traditional finance things.
00:01:52.994 - 00:01:53.396, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:53.468 - 00:02:02.284, Speaker B: And I went back to crypto and I said, wow, if I have an NFT, I can essentially recreate our entire back end. And we did it within a couple days. Built and still on it, actually.
00:02:02.372 - 00:02:02.828, Speaker A: Wow.
00:02:02.924 - 00:02:21.386, Speaker B: And it was like, wow, this is so much easier. This is an upgrade of the monetary system, what we've been talking about as long as I can remember, bitcoin, and we're finally there, we're able to do it. But it was too early. It was a, b, two, c. Okay, cool. And that's why we kind of pivoted to empire now. But like, that was really, like, the deep dive of working in crypto wasn't 2021 in the summer.
00:02:21.468 - 00:02:31.822, Speaker A: Okay, wow, that's crazy. So were you involved at all anywhere, like, in the bull market of, like, 2017, or were you kind of like an onlooker during that period?
00:02:31.886 - 00:02:46.270, Speaker B: Bit of an onlooker. Like, I definitely was buying into icos. I bought a bunch of ETh and, like, not a bunch, not a whale by any means. But when I discovered the NFTs last summer, I had house money to play with. Like, oh, well, I bought ETH at dollar 20 or whatever it was.
00:02:46.390 - 00:02:47.702, Speaker A: That's a good entry price.
00:02:47.766 - 00:03:05.266, Speaker B: Yeah, it might have been more than that, but, you know, the point is it was enough that, like, oh, wow, I had a nice chuck him out there, but I didn't. I spent too much time as a bitcoin maxi. I'll admit it, like, I was like, this sounds cool, but it should all should be on bitcoin. So I didn't really pay attention to, like, defi summer.
00:03:05.338 - 00:03:05.666, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:05.698 - 00:03:09.802, Speaker B: Like, I missed a, regrettably, I missed a lot on eth those years, for sure.
00:03:09.826 - 00:03:50.548, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's super interesting. I think I was doing another podcast, and he kind of had a similar journey where he was like, bitcoin Maxi and kind of refused to look at other chains. And then he was like, oh, wait, they're actually doing, like, some pretty interesting things that are either impossible or very hard to do on bitcoin. And he started building on Ethereum. So I think it's cool. I think the hard part in crypto is just always keeping, like, an open mind because it's changing so fast that if you're like a maxi of any single chain, you'll probably miss things that you should be seeing.
00:03:50.684 - 00:04:20.692, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that's it actually served me well. Being a bitcoin maxi for as long as I was, helped me realize when other people are. So I now chat with a lot of people in Ethereum, and they have the same talking points that I had about Ethereum. It's like, this is the exact same thing I said four years ago. And so I can hear, and I'm like, you know, it's, you need to open your mind up to little things. So it's served me well the last six months or so, looking at other chains as well and just hearing the argument points, how invalid they are.
00:04:20.692 - 00:04:31.560, Speaker B: And, you know, and I've been fortunate enough to meet a lot of people from the foundation, a lot of founders in different chains, and to get to talk to them and what they love about it. And honestly, I fall in love with almost every chain. Like, hence multi chain mic.
00:04:31.980 - 00:04:39.368, Speaker A: That's awesome. Now, I used to be an eth maxi myself, and, yeah, open mind is definitely paramount.
00:04:39.484 - 00:04:49.728, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And it's not different than just open mind towards anything else. If you ever met someone who's never left their hometown or their country, and they're like, oh, that place sucks. It's like, have you ever been, like, no.
00:04:49.864 - 00:04:50.632, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:50.816 - 00:05:04.424, Speaker B: Like, it's like, you need. It's in ignorance. And that's another thing that goes back to my journey a little bit. Being is traveling. I was fortunate enough, my sister, when I was 20, sent me to Australia. She's like, go study abroad. You need to learn something.
00:05:04.424 - 00:05:07.872, Speaker B: Showed up with, like, $300 in my pocket down there and went to school.
00:05:07.936 - 00:05:08.434, Speaker A: Hell, yeah.
00:05:08.512 - 00:05:13.926, Speaker B: But ever since then, I lived in five countries on four continents. And that's helped the same concept.
00:05:13.958 - 00:05:14.270, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:14.350 - 00:05:20.966, Speaker B: This reduction of ignorance on the chains is actually similar to geographical regions 100%.
00:05:21.038 - 00:05:57.248, Speaker A: And, I mean, I think I used to work in the travel industry, and one of the biggest things about travel is just how much it actually does open up your mind and showcase different viewpoints. And I think that's one of the unique things about crypto as well. Just being global. From essentially day one, how many people travel and go to different events? You've gone to multiple different events. How would you kind of say, like, traveling to different events, like, around the world has kind of, I guess is, like, different for, like, each communities. Like, how are the communities in those different locations?
00:05:57.384 - 00:06:17.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, let's see. It's south by southwest. In 2009 was, like, my first big tech conference that I went to. Nice, and I haven't stopped since. I did not realize how home that is to me. I actually love being in the crowd, listening to a panel, also working at the same time, meeting people at night. I live for these kind of meetups.
00:06:17.754 - 00:06:42.450, Speaker B: And what I really like about what Solana is doing right now, we're the New York City hacker house. I'm an IRL. Maxi. If there's any kind of axie, it's IRL. It's getting these communities together to get a vibe, going to get things moving. So, I mean, you know, what was early on going back to 2000 910 eleven. I was the social media guy, and, like, all the conferences were the same.
00:06:42.490 - 00:06:42.986, Speaker A: Folks.
00:06:43.098 - 00:06:54.674, Speaker B: We're in a very special time right now, seeing the same people in Chicago and Miami and Lisbon, and, like, we're all kind of doing the circuit, but unfortunately. But unfortunately, we're all going to break off for the next couple years.
00:06:54.722 - 00:06:55.546, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure.
00:06:55.658 - 00:07:03.490, Speaker B: Because what happened is I'll get asked to speak at an insurance conference because they wanted to know how they should enable web3 or NFts for their clients.
00:07:03.570 - 00:07:03.978, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:04.074 - 00:07:24.966, Speaker B: And that's what happened with social media. We all became like, we were all there for a couple of years, and then it just became everything. It became part of every single company, everyone's lives. And this, to me, I think, is, it's kind of the same thing, but it's even more in depth. I think this is actually gonna have way bigger impact than social media did, for better or worse, on all of our lives, in every organization, for sure.
00:07:25.038 - 00:07:42.320, Speaker A: And maybe to pull on that thread a little bit more how, like, just being early to, like, new things with, like, social media and now, like, I, web3 and crypto, how have you been able to, like, identify these things that are happening relatively fast but also be early to them?
00:07:42.700 - 00:07:43.364, Speaker B: Tinker.
00:07:43.452 - 00:07:43.908, Speaker A: Tinker.
00:07:43.964 - 00:08:13.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm in way too many. I have way too many apps on my phone. I'm in way too many discords. I've been way too many, Dallas. But you find something that's interesting there, and you learn. You just got to keep tinkering and playing and showing up. And I think, and going back to the conference part of it, you know, having two years of being inside, really, I didn't realize how much it killed me, but it slowed down society in general in terms of, like, having these interactions and these, these things.
00:08:13.080 - 00:08:16.716, Speaker B: So showing up is kind of half of the battle in anything.
00:08:16.828 - 00:08:36.916, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree. I haven't been to too many of the conferences outside of, like, breakpoint. I went to bitcoin last year, but I've realized just being here, how much energy I actually do get from it, especially when you're on the computer the vast majority of day, just being with people that are like minded and kind of all speak the same language, it's empowering.
00:08:36.988 - 00:08:47.036, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. And that's, and that's. That's how we started Empire Dow. Right. It was like, people want to get back. They're still kind of like, where are we at with COVID and what's the situation?
00:08:47.148 - 00:08:47.492, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:47.556 - 00:08:52.812, Speaker B: And, you know, we're realizing. I'm realizing quickly that this energy is so hard to duplicate.
00:08:52.876 - 00:08:53.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:53.212 - 00:09:07.666, Speaker B: And once I went to breakpoint. When was that? In November. November, yeah. That was kind of like, we're back, man. We're back. Nftnyc was one of those so, you know, I was like, let's capitalize on these interactions I had. My heart was full when these things were back.
00:09:07.666 - 00:09:13.050, Speaker B: And I'm like, yes, this is it. Let's do this full time. And that's why we're opening up Empire Dao, actually.
00:09:13.130 - 00:09:25.178, Speaker A: Hell yeah. So maybe for those that aren't super familiar with Empire Dao, could you give, like, a brief overview of what it is? Like what your role is there and then what you're trying to do with it?
00:09:25.234 - 00:09:42.954, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So it's a high level protocol that pretty much anyone in the world can spin up a dao with their own token so they can maintain control, their own local economy. In our case, you can book desks and whatnot. So Empire Dao in New York City is our first node of many nodes, if you will.
00:09:43.002 - 00:09:43.354, Speaker A: Nice.
00:09:43.442 - 00:10:03.000, Speaker B: So I'll talk to. So that's kind of the high level one. EmPiRE DAo Stuff in New York City is a five story building in the Bowery, and it's going to serve as a gallery, NFT gallery lobby space that you event center that you can come in, launch your events, or just hang out and vibe with everyone who's in the space.
00:10:03.080 - 00:10:03.584, Speaker A: Nice.
00:10:03.712 - 00:10:17.536, Speaker B: But then there's also three floors of both co working and permanent desks. So we've got all web3. We have a few level one, level two chains that are going to have their 24 7365 hacker houses going in there. So their ecosystem can grow and have to go.
00:10:17.608 - 00:10:18.642, Speaker A: That'd be super awesome.
00:10:18.776 - 00:10:48.034, Speaker B: But then we're also going to have hot desk. So you might own a desk with an NFT, and then if you're traveling for a week, you can put it on the market and get market prices for it and put a smart contract behind for two weeks or whatever, you're gone or even a day. You only want to work once or twice a week. Because what we're finding is I was fortunate enough to, I worked for two major corporations, but both, while I did, I was kind of hybrid. So this hybrid model that we're getting back to, I've been doing it for a decade, and it's what people want. Yeah, they don't want to commit five days, seven days. You're committing seven days.
00:10:48.034 - 00:11:17.058, Speaker B: Really? A week to this? When you commit to a real estate officer, you know, you don't have any flexibility. There's people on the weekends that want to work in your space. Yeah, you know, why not build that flexibility? So that's something that we're tinkering with. And then we have a floor of dows that we're going to experiment with. Some might be pop up, some might be permanent. We might do a flex dal type thing where it's a gym, you can book your trainer and the sessions in there and then maybe we'll create some gym technology out of there that anyone else in the planet could use for their local gym.
00:11:17.114 - 00:11:17.714, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:11:17.802 - 00:11:42.498, Speaker B: So it's going to be a laboratory, if you will, but also an event space and kind of, you know, and going back to my being a degenerate and owning too many nfTs, too many Dallas, I get a lot of meetups. And you know, in New York it's kind of tough sometimes to find places. In the summer it's great. In the winter somewhere. Like it's not alcohol based and a lot of the members are like, oh, great, we're meeting at a pub and I don't really drink, but like, I'm used to it.
00:11:42.554 - 00:11:42.858, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:42.914 - 00:11:53.210, Speaker B: Like this is a place that we want NFT projects to come and meet and also not only see their art on the walls or their projects, but see others and get, get closer to the other people in the community.
00:11:53.370 - 00:12:14.652, Speaker A: That's awesome. No, it's super amazing. I really appreciate the community aspect that you're trying to replicate in the hacker houses. And not only just individual teams, but multiple teams and having that energy from every team kind of together can breed something special.
00:12:14.796 - 00:12:43.182, Speaker B: That's right too. And the other thing is being a dao ourselves, we're going to invest in pretty much every project that's working out of there. So just by holding our token and working in there, you kind of own a little piece of everyone else's company in there as well. So at other coworking locations that we might know, you know, they, it's good, but you don't really, you might not work in the same industry. We want people to work in this all in web3 and you also have that co ownership, so it feels like a village. Like if they do better, I do better. So in the back of your mind you're like, oh, I have a little piece of that.
00:12:43.182 - 00:13:04.034, Speaker B: So if they ask for a designer or an introduction, you're a little more likely to get back to them in a sooner fashion than you would somebody, some company that you don't own a piece of. So we want to instill that kind of camaraderie and it's brilliant. I mean, like we're all going to make it is like we're all going to make it. Like hyper capitalist. Like we're all going to make money, but we're all going to make it super inclusive too. So it's like communist.
00:13:04.082 - 00:13:05.194, Speaker A: I like that. I like that.
00:13:05.282 - 00:13:14.314, Speaker B: So, like, this kind of comm, this kind of convergence of those two styles is brilliant. And I don't think we've had any kind of tools in the world that could really enable this kind of thing before.
00:13:14.482 - 00:13:32.316, Speaker A: No, I'm definitely looking forward to the one in New York opening. Are there any, I know that one's, like just being finalized now. Uh, but I have any, are there any plans in the work for future houses that are already in the works or are those still like TBD at the moment?
00:13:32.388 - 00:13:39.388, Speaker B: A little TBD, but I mean, there's a, you know, Mountain Dow was a great example of what we're doing that was a month long. We're trying to make it permanent.
00:13:39.444 - 00:13:43.092, Speaker A: Okay. So we're working closely with Mountain Dow specifically on your protocol.
00:13:43.196 - 00:13:43.532, Speaker B: No.
00:13:43.596 - 00:13:43.964, Speaker A: Okay.
00:13:44.012 - 00:13:50.324, Speaker B: They've spun it up themselves. This is the concept of, like, we, we like to utilize your protocol, friend. Let's do this full time.
00:13:50.372 - 00:13:54.602, Speaker A: So that was super cool. I saw lots of pictures from the mountain Dow and I was jealous.
00:13:54.716 - 00:14:20.870, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's cool. And so these hacker houses are like, you know, weekends or week long. They did a month long. We're gonna do multi year of that and then it's gonna go back there and they'll be a full time as well. And then we're Denver and Montreal, that we have some folks in there that also want to spin up something very similar. So like, they're right on. And then obviously Lisbon and Miami and these other places, la, really, they have been coming to us too, and saying, hey, hey, we want to build something like that here too.
00:14:20.870 - 00:14:23.592, Speaker B: So it'll expand suddenly and then all at once.
00:14:23.726 - 00:14:34.316, Speaker A: That's, that's epic. I'm definitely looking forward to empire Dao starting up in New York and also expanding worldwide.
00:14:34.388 - 00:14:51.340, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It should be, it should be a great global community and, yeah. And hypothetically, you'll be able to swap out, so you'll be able to use any crypto there. But like, say you're a New York pass, you'll be able to swap that easy for La Pass when you're visiting there. And we're still working the mechanisms of that, but the idea is that you should be able to go anywhere on the planet.
00:14:51.420 - 00:15:07.372, Speaker A: Okay, nice. That'll be awesome. So you mentioned at the beginning that you're in quite a few daos. Another one that has kind of become popular relatively recently that you're involved with is Linksdao.
00:15:07.436 - 00:15:08.084, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:08.252 - 00:15:12.844, Speaker A: Could you touch a little bit more on Linksdao and what Linksdao is doing?
00:15:12.932 - 00:15:36.970, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. And, I mean, I'm not associated directly with the project or anything. I'm just a member who's got the NFT. So, you know, I've been golfing in New York for. Let me back up a little bit. The social communities that we have, like, typically for centuries, it was based around religion on weekends, and we kind of got away from that in the last couple generations.
00:15:36.970 - 00:15:46.022, Speaker B: And it's kind of easy to make your cruise in high school and university and then your first job, and then when you have kids, you have the other parents, whatnot. But it kind of gets a little harder from there.
00:15:46.086 - 00:15:46.542, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:46.646 - 00:15:53.726, Speaker B: I was fortunate enough to play australian rules football for the Denver Bulldogs for eight years, so we traveled three times a year, and that was my crew.
00:15:53.758 - 00:15:54.286, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:54.438 - 00:15:58.590, Speaker B: We lived together. It was. It was a good social community, and I played for the New York Magpies for a decade.
00:15:58.670 - 00:15:59.150, Speaker A: Okay.
00:15:59.230 - 00:16:16.616, Speaker B: I'm 42 now, so, like, I got hurt last year. I embarrassed myself. Like, it's. It's time to hang up the boots. And that's. So what's happened is NFT projects, two of them particularly, have really kind of connected me to my interest. And then one is Linksdale.
00:16:16.616 - 00:16:41.072, Speaker B: I've been golfing by myself in New York for a decade, which I don't mind. I like playing by myself, but I don't have a crew. And overnight, by buying an NFT and being part of the Linksdale and link style, just a quick backup is we're buying a golf course. So I think they raised I don't know how many million in 48 hours selling NFTs. And I think they're raising funds now. So we're actually going to all own a golf course together. They've got merch coming out.
00:16:41.136 - 00:16:42.100, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:16:42.400 - 00:16:49.756, Speaker B: We just had our first outing in Austin over South by Southwest, so we had a tournament and it was great. I think 150 people showed up.
00:16:49.828 - 00:16:50.348, Speaker A: That's awesome.
00:16:50.404 - 00:17:23.106, Speaker B: And what's cool about it is when you see them, it's like another sports fan that, like, has your hat or something like that. Like, you have some something together. If someone's like, oh, I'm gonna get 150 people together to go golf for a week, I'm like, no, I'm not just gonna, like, show up to some random folks. That's exactly what I did. But since we all had a vested interest in this project succeeding, like, we all genuinely own it, I feel ownership of it. I'm not part of the core team or anything, but I feel ownership of it. And then there's a subreddit, or Subreddit, a channel within Discord of New York City members.
00:17:23.178 - 00:17:23.674, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:23.762 - 00:17:47.208, Speaker B: They meet up on Wednesday nights and play in the indoor golf Simulator. And then the Summer, we're gonna be getting together, doing something. So this NFt, to me, this Dow, I'm not selling anytime soon. This is my social community, and the monkey dao is kind of the other one in there. But that's, that's kind of what links Dow is up to. And it's been a really cool project. And I genuinely think in a decade, we'll probably have more golf courses than any other company on the organization on the planet.
00:17:47.264 - 00:17:52.464, Speaker A: I forgot that they are building that golf course. That's insane.
00:17:52.512 - 00:17:54.016, Speaker B: They're probably gonna buy a golf course.
00:17:54.208 - 00:17:56.660, Speaker A: Yeah. Both are ridiculous.
00:17:57.480 - 00:18:04.448, Speaker B: It won't be surprised if we actually do design and in next decade or so, like, actually have our own course that we come out with.
00:18:04.464 - 00:18:45.412, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome, huh? No, I mean, I think, I mean, you nailed it on, like, the social communities and dao aspect. It's been super interesting to watch kind of unfold over time, because I personally was super hyped about Defi and all the stuff that was going on in Defi summer with composability. And I was trying to show all my friends, I was like, hey, look, do a swap on uniswap. Like, take a loan out of. But they're like, logan, like, no, but then NFTs came around and I was like, hey, this mint is dropping. Come in. Like, let's do this mint.
00:18:45.412 - 00:19:01.692, Speaker A: And they started getting involved in these communities as they started minting these projects, and they loved nfTs. And so I've just personally been surprised by how strong the NFT and Daos communities have become in such a short period of time.
00:19:01.836 - 00:19:19.260, Speaker B: It's crazy. Yeah. And I think it's, I'll go back to link style moment, because when I was in the discord there, every more than half had no profile picture in there. And where did that mean? That mean that this was their first NFT.
00:19:19.340 - 00:19:19.876, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:19:19.948 - 00:19:35.318, Speaker B: They came in, it was their first time on discord, their first time connecting a wallet, their first time actually using crypto. Some probably like, oh, I have some bitcoin, like, but this was their first time. And they made the jump because of their passion around golf, around the community.
00:19:35.414 - 00:19:35.902, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:36.006 - 00:19:43.382, Speaker B: And that's where it was. It's like, this is a great example for people that they're gonna love this, but they have to have that real world example.
00:19:43.446 - 00:19:43.926, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:44.038 - 00:20:06.358, Speaker B: And if you're like, it's, we're just all, you know, doing defi stuff all night, like, yeah, it's gonna be hard to build around that now. I think it's gonna be easier. And links that opened up the avenue for something like Empire Dow, it made something like, oh, something tangible that we can do. We now can do that in the real world as well. And so that's why I'm always pumped about that project as a golfer, but then also as an entrepreneur building an.
00:20:06.374 - 00:20:20.854, Speaker A: IRL, it's amazing what a group of individuals that want to achieve something can achieve. And I think the NFTs and Daos are and embodiment of that, so it's very cool.
00:20:20.982 - 00:20:29.110, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I guess some of it's not so new. Right. If you think about like a neighborhood or hoa of like a shared condo unit. Right?
00:20:29.150 - 00:20:29.486, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:29.558 - 00:20:39.574, Speaker B: So I am the president of my 29 unit condo unit in Brooklyn, and it's the same thing. Like, we all own something. We all have a deed, essentially, the NFT. Right?
00:20:39.622 - 00:20:39.846, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:39.878 - 00:21:07.116, Speaker B: We have vested interest in when we do sell the going up. So we do like, you know, we shield a bit our neighborhood and our building and like, we want things, we vote on things to get upgraded, but it's such an efficient way of how we organize it. And if it was all in chain, it would be thousands times better to do the voting to move the funds, all of it, and, like, not have money just sitting in the treasury doing nothing.
00:21:07.188 - 00:21:07.628, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:07.724 - 00:21:20.464, Speaker B: So there's, there's a lot of aspects of, like, this kind of shared ownership. Isn't that new going back, like, to the fantasy football model? Like, it's the same kind of thing, but it's so much simpler, so much more efficient if you can put it on chain and have that kind of functionality behind it.
00:21:20.512 - 00:21:46.960, Speaker A: I totally agree. I totally agree. One of the other things you touched upon was the monkey Dao, and we're both a part of the monkey Dao. Super awesome community. And everybody that I've met in the monkey Dao are ballers. They're not just a sense of ballers, but they go out, they build, they're welcoming, they're super awesome community. You have an involvement in there.
00:21:46.960 - 00:21:52.176, Speaker A: Can you touch upon your involvement and also kind of how you came into the monkey doe?
00:21:52.248 - 00:22:00.560, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So, yeah, just full disclosure. I'm part of the multi sign committee. I think 16 of us on that.
00:22:00.720 - 00:22:01.528, Speaker A: Good disclosure.
00:22:01.584 - 00:22:35.258, Speaker B: Yeah. Of that committee. So we lead different parts of it, different pods of, you know, whether it's marketing or whatnot. So we run the project together along with the community, and we have different levels of where we put votes out to the members of the board members or of the overall committee. But the monkey Dao for me was the first, I think it was my first Solana NFT and the Dow was coming up. That's purely why I bought it, because there was the first dao on Solana was coming out. And I was like, I need to be involved in this.
00:22:35.258 - 00:22:59.720, Speaker B: I want to get to see it early. I want to experience it from the beginning. And I did. I got to witness it and watch it in the first three months or so, go, wow, they created this. And this wasn't the guys who, this wasn't the team who started the project. This was just from the members going, we're into this project, let's build it. And what it turned out to be is entrepreneurs and investors in the Solano ecosystem, which I was both.
00:22:59.720 - 00:23:27.382, Speaker B: And so I was like, wow, this is my squad. This is my community. I want to be there. So, like, I enjoyed all the conversations that were happening on discord, and I saw how the first board went. I chimed in on their voting structure. Like, they were like, oh, if you have 80 monkeys, do you get 80 votes, or is it one per wallet? And they capped it at three. Right? So, like, if you do have a lot, you get more votes, but not enough where, you know, people are going to you and trying to sway your vote.
00:23:27.382 - 00:23:28.510, Speaker B: We don't want it to turn into that.
00:23:28.550 - 00:23:29.038, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:29.174 - 00:24:05.690, Speaker B: So I got to witness this in real time, out loud, sit in kind of their public board meetings, and it was a great experience. And then in December, I decided to put myself up and nominate myself, having this experience of being the board president and starting these leagues. And I was like, oh, wow, this is a good fit. And I ran on kind of this multi chain future. I think Solana is, by default, the first popular chain that is not maximalist. By default. Like most people, there is some soul maxism in there, don't get me wrong.
00:24:05.690 - 00:24:23.938, Speaker B: But it's not as if, you know, a lot of people came from Ethereum and they understand, like, oh, this is, this has a purpose. That has a purpose. There's other ones that are going to be out there. And I think the Solana monkey business has, and the monkey Dow specifically has a responsibility to represent that across all of web3.
00:24:24.074 - 00:24:24.602, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:24.706 - 00:24:33.646, Speaker B: And so we started the multi chain series. It's every other week, we interview entrepreneurs and builders and people from their foundations from different chains.
00:24:33.718 - 00:24:34.262, Speaker A: Okay.
00:24:34.366 - 00:24:37.158, Speaker B: To reduce the ignorance. What's happening in your chain and the.
00:24:37.174 - 00:24:38.070, Speaker A: Monkey dogs doing that?
00:24:38.110 - 00:24:39.558, Speaker B: Yeah, we do it every other week. Every other Thursday.
00:24:39.614 - 00:24:40.478, Speaker A: I do not know that.
00:24:40.534 - 00:24:40.982, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:41.086 - 00:24:41.654, Speaker A: Badass.
00:24:41.742 - 00:24:50.630, Speaker B: We have two episodes up. We did Algorand and we did stacks recently. I think we're gonna do Tara and near in the next couple episodes.
00:24:50.670 - 00:24:51.486, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:24:51.678 - 00:25:10.838, Speaker B: So. And it's good. We ask questions about them and, you know, what projects are popular. And again, full disclosure, I usually have, like, an NFT or two on all these chains, but. Yeah. And then we also started the open habitat, which is a discord just for projects on these different chains that are successful. So we don't just let anyone in, but we let projects in there.
00:25:10.838 - 00:25:23.710, Speaker B: We have an AMA for each chain because sometimes, like, oh, well, how do you guys swap whatever to whatever and, like, people answer it and then, like, we're collaborating now on these different projects. And, of course, the first project we're collaborating on is a multi chain poker tournament.
00:25:23.790 - 00:25:24.246, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:24.318 - 00:25:29.302, Speaker B: To see who comes out. So you, like, you might have to win your own chain and then come out and be at the final table of six or something like that.
00:25:29.326 - 00:25:30.462, Speaker A: Nice. That would be a good game.
00:25:30.566 - 00:25:45.382, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But the overall thing is to kind of serve, you know, the monkey Dao started it, but we don't want to own it. Ultimately, we want it to be owned by the different NFT projects on endows, on different chains, and to kind of be like, almost like a un. Right. Like we helped start it, but it's not owned by us or anything.
00:25:45.406 - 00:25:46.318, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:25:46.414 - 00:25:57.082, Speaker B: Yeah. And so that's kind of the monkey down a nutshell. My involvement and where I, you know, the future of it is being a leader not just on Solana, but in web3 in general.
00:25:57.186 - 00:26:18.218, Speaker A: I love that I haven't been as close to the monkey Dao ecosystem and following along with it. So get amongst it, man. Yeah, that's super cool that the monkeys are doing that not only on Solana, but bridging out to other chains and trying to be leaders among the industry.
00:26:18.314 - 00:26:35.530, Speaker B: And the cool thing is, on the board meetings, I'm the dumbest guy in the room every time. There are some big brains in that. And I'm dead serious, man. Like, these guys are really smart. What they're doing, the programs, the different revenue models they're looking at, and it's, you know, it's a. It's a fully functioning startup, and it's. It's got a lot of potential.
00:26:35.530 - 00:26:47.520, Speaker B: And I think we'll look back in a decade or two when people like these are some of the biggest, most important entities and organizations on the planet. Are these Daos right now that we're seeing in their infancy. And I think the monkey dal will be one of those.
00:26:47.860 - 00:27:17.720, Speaker A: I could not agree more. That's awesome. Yeah. Maybe we could touch upon a little bit more, or we kind of did, but maybe go a little bit deeper into kind of your thoughts on, like, the ecosystem as a whole, being a multi chain enjoyer. Yeah. And yeah, kind of speak about the multi chunk, multi chain feature that you're kind of envisioning, and then also perhaps talk about why you're building Empire Dao on Solana.
00:27:17.880 - 00:27:38.622, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So let's start the multi chain. I think this backend future. I know blockchains are more than just a database, but at the same time, the end user really doesn't care how they move something. Right. And we're moving packets of data across the Internet in a much more efficient way, in a better way. The end users doesn't care.
00:27:38.622 - 00:28:03.242, Speaker B: And I feel. And what I'm finding is, with these different chains, some of them have really good, specific uses and certain clients that are fitting that. Okay, so I don't know. I'll throw out Algorand, for example. My friends and I worked at BNY, Mellon and Wall street, and a lot of my counterparts were the head of digital innovation. So they're working in, and they're really attracted to it because it came out of Boston. These Nobel laureates made it.
00:28:03.242 - 00:28:19.206, Speaker B: And so they have a real focus on security of traditional finance that might. I have no idea if that might be the most logical sense for what they're building. Specifically, what we're seeing in Solana is fast, cheap transactions, great for gaming, things you can never do with gas fees. Right?
00:28:19.278 - 00:28:19.598, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:19.654 - 00:28:43.504, Speaker B: And the others might have the infrastructure of it. So I see hundreds of thousands of blockchains in the future with specific uses coming up continuously with their own feature set. If you think about it. Let's compare it to video or just content in general, how many places do you read content on? How many places do you see video? Every single social media platform has some kind of video or another.
00:28:43.672 - 00:28:44.184, Speaker A: True.
00:28:44.272 - 00:28:52.832, Speaker B: And that's, again, are they gonna. Is any of them gonna be best? Like, there's. There's a lot of functionality that they all share, but they have different audiences and different communities around them.
00:28:52.856 - 00:28:53.296, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:53.408 - 00:29:15.800, Speaker B: So that's why I'm bullish on the multi chain future. I don't see one for them all by any means. And I think it's just going to continue to grow and different communities will find their, their, their niche that, that they, uh, they collaborate around. So, yeah, I think it's, it's, it's early days, but it's, it's also, I think all these chains are going to still be around. Be like, oh, it's going to be three or four. I think there's going to be three or 4000.
00:29:16.700 - 00:29:55.190, Speaker A: I may be a contrarian take. I don't know. We'll see how it plays out. I've been super surprised. I mean, going back to how early it is, if you just look at like, dune analytics and their dashboards for OpenSea, for example, has like a million users on like, the ETH L1, but on like Polygon, they have like another million users. But in the grand scheme of things, from like, an NFT standpoint, that is a drop in the bucket compared to Facebook or Google and the amount of customers that they have on their applications. And then if you start bridging down to, like, Defi, there's a couple hundred thousand.
00:29:55.190 - 00:30:00.850, Speaker A: I think Uniswap's the most popular dapp with like 4 million ever doing a swap.
00:30:00.890 - 00:30:01.914, Speaker B: Still nothing.
00:30:02.042 - 00:30:16.642, Speaker A: Nothing. And so I'm very much excited for, I don't know, just more people in general coming into the ecosystem and, I don't know, enjoying the chains they will.
00:30:16.786 - 00:30:24.086, Speaker B: We like to draw lines in the sand. I was around the days when people said, I'll never get a mobile phone. Like, no one needs know where I'm at at all times.
00:30:24.158 - 00:30:25.046, Speaker A: Right. That's funny.
00:30:25.118 - 00:30:32.222, Speaker B: Then to social media. No one cares what I had for lunch. I'll never get a social media account. Right. And now it's, I'll never get an NFT or joy.
00:30:32.246 - 00:30:34.294, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't like those analysis.
00:30:34.382 - 00:30:43.718, Speaker B: It's like you're going to. You might not even realize it in two or three years that it's on the blockchain or it's crypto based. You might not even know it. It's just part of your life.
00:30:43.774 - 00:30:43.958, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:43.974 - 00:30:45.174, Speaker B: And that's where we're building towards.
00:30:45.222 - 00:30:49.340, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's. I totally agree. Very cool.
00:30:49.720 - 00:31:21.218, Speaker B: And to answer your question about Solana, I mean, like, for us, we need to be making daily nfts, right? So we need to be pushing out that we need fast, cheap movement of our nfts and our creation of tokens. And right now, having the experience of built in Solana. And also, I mean, frankly, Solana's been betting on IRL, and that's, so are we. And they have more so than any other chain. So I've been bouncing around among these other conferences. I've gone into their hackathons and their houses, and some are, you know, others are doing it, but no one's doing it on this extent.
00:31:21.314 - 00:31:55.480, Speaker A: I feel like cross global. I mean, that's the alpha that, like, people don't see, or at least that I have not witnessed so far. I come to these hacker houses and I follow the Twitter accounts, and so I seeing all this activity and I'm blown away. There's so many engineers, so many developers, so many people trying to fun projects in the space. Not that that doesn't happen on any chains, but the frequency and the order of magnitude that the events are put on and to the high standard that they are done, it's just super impressive.
00:31:56.020 - 00:32:19.060, Speaker B: It's a, yeah, they're, they're doing something very special here. And I think it'll, it'll be replicated. I hope it will. Yeah, I mean, I hope everyone does this and has these interactions and builds together. I mean, even today, I was collaborating with someone that we're going to be working on between Mountain Dow and Empire now and how we're going like that just from a collision that we just happen to walk past each other in the right place. Right. So, like, these kind of things are going to turn into.
00:32:19.060 - 00:32:36.744, Speaker B: And honestly, let me back up to a little bit to Empire now. It was based on a hacker house day that was in Soho in New York, and that's where I met Luke and Mary from Bridge Split. We said, hey, we're looking for space. Hey, should we do this more often? And that's kind of how empire Dow started. Was that one of these places?
00:32:36.872 - 00:32:37.302, Speaker A: Huh?
00:32:37.376 - 00:33:02.510, Speaker B: And let me back up again that I was at that place because I ran into ox banana at a main net event. He saw me wearing my monkey shirt, came running across the room and said, another monkey. The first one I met in person, this is last summer, and they said, oh, you got to get my telegram group. It's a Solana NYC group. And then that was what put me into that day. And then that's how Empire Dao started, by owning a monkey and.
00:33:02.970 - 00:33:05.426, Speaker A: Yeah, irl Maxi.
00:33:05.498 - 00:33:07.390, Speaker B: Irl Maxi. That's it, man.
00:33:07.770 - 00:33:25.886, Speaker A: I think, I mean, and you touched upon it the last couple of years with COVID and everything that's just been going on in the world, being able to see people, being able to enjoy each other's presence and just have that energy of that community, it is something special.
00:33:26.078 - 00:33:28.798, Speaker B: Yeah, that's it. So this is. I mean, even this interaction, right?
00:33:28.854 - 00:33:29.134, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:29.182 - 00:33:31.726, Speaker B: Doing this episode, it wouldn't happen if we didn't bump into each other yesterday.
00:33:31.758 - 00:33:35.470, Speaker A: That's true. That's true. No, I'm becoming an IRL.
00:33:35.510 - 00:33:39.890, Speaker B: Max. Join my Ir. No, I don't know. That would be. But, yeah. Yeah.
00:33:40.270 - 00:33:50.886, Speaker A: Um, cool. I I think a lot of people are maybe trying to learn about the space, trying to learn about nfts, trying to learn about daos. Um, you said tinkering.
00:33:50.998 - 00:33:51.550, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:51.670 - 00:33:58.846, Speaker A: Is there any, like, tinkering advice, or how do you go about, like, uh, trying to learn or teach yourself?
00:33:58.998 - 00:34:16.518, Speaker B: Yeah, I will say there's a lot that you have to be careful with, right? Like, there's a lot of. A lot of rug pulls, as they call, a lot of scams, a lot of different ways to get taken. Whenever I do tinker on any chain and anything, I always do, like, $5 transactions at first for everything.
00:34:16.614 - 00:34:16.990, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:17.030 - 00:34:33.352, Speaker B: Like, I still. It's a habit I have of, like, let me just send something small first, because I'm absentminded. I get distracted and suddenly, like, my wallets drained or something. Right. So I don't want that to happen. So anytime I make a transaction, I'm in the habit of, like, doing a small one first just to make sure I do it.
00:34:33.406 - 00:34:33.980, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:34.100 - 00:35:02.026, Speaker B: So I definitely recommend that for anybody. But what I really would recommend is just getting into the community. At this point in 2022, discord is where all the communities kind of live, and you can find their information. Hang out there for a week or two. If you're in, let's say, into wine. There's the vine Dal, and it's like, all right, I'm in there. Let me jump in their community, spend a week or two, listen to their weekly meetings, and go, oh, wow, these people are legit.
00:35:02.026 - 00:35:11.078, Speaker B: Do your own research. I don't know if they are. And then you could find out pretty quickly if, like, these are the people that you would buy with, would you want to hang out with them? Irl.
00:35:11.174 - 00:35:11.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:11.702 - 00:35:25.470, Speaker B: And then it's like, okay, let me. What's. What's the idea of buying it? I have to get a wallet. I have to do that. YouTube is your friend. Use that in how to download, how to make transactions. Every single type of transaction, someone's recorded a video for.
00:35:25.470 - 00:35:46.714, Speaker B: So you can find those. But, yeah, be really careful. But at the same time, you also have to be a bit adventurous, and that's why I like to do it. In, you know, in really small increments so that you can test, but it doesn't cost you much to learn, but know that you are learning. This is a whole new Internet. Like, web3 is not an exaggeration. This is an upgrade from the Internet that we know.
00:35:46.714 - 00:35:55.698, Speaker B: And it takes, it takes. It's a learning curve for everybody. Even people who are, like, really into it still find themselves getting, getting taken. So you have to be careful.
00:35:55.794 - 00:36:29.108, Speaker A: 1000%. I think I kind of describe it as, like, mountain climbing in a sense that most people are already in some endeavor and on top of their mountain or pretty far up their mountain. But with web3, it's hard because it's a new mountain. You have to go back down and you have to restart and climb a new mountain to learn. And I think that's why we're seeing a lot of young people interested in this space, because they're just starting their ascent. But no, I would totally agree, and.
00:36:29.164 - 00:36:45.640, Speaker B: Let'S just jump on those mountains real quick. The mountain that I came from, my niece is 16, and she was like, she thinks of TikTok and Instagram. Like, my generation thought of smoking. Like, oh, it's a bad habit, really. You're all day, you're addicted to it. She's not wrong.
00:36:47.780 - 00:36:48.612, Speaker A: She's wise.
00:36:48.716 - 00:37:13.236, Speaker B: And so when I showed her, I set her up with a phantom wallet and then kind of showed her like, oh, you can log in these different things. She's like, wait a minute. They didn't take my name, my address, anything, and I can go to these. And I'm like, yeah, the sites aren't as good yet. They're getting built out every day. But, yeah, this whole Internet, you don't get tracked for anything. And, you know, she's well aware of how Google monetizes and how they track you for everything.
00:37:13.236 - 00:37:35.860, Speaker B: And Instagram and Netflix knows all your habits. And she was like, wow, I am in. I'm in on this, you know. And the good thing is, you know, you also get paid to use it, too, right? Yeah, you might get an airdrop, a couple hundred, couple, you know, tens of thousands of dollars if you're lucky. But no, by using the products, they often reward you and they don't take your data specifically. So it's. It's a win win.
00:37:35.860 - 00:37:51.572, Speaker B: It's a new mountain. I'm sure there's negative ramifications. I'm sure the naivety that, like, we didn't realize with social media, I remember, you know, we're going to change the world. It's all going to be better. We didn't realize the negative ramifications of misinformation and. And the addiction. We had no idea that this was going to come.
00:37:51.572 - 00:37:59.444, Speaker B: And I imagine there's going to be some negative ramifications that come out of web3 as well that are unforeseen. But that's technology. We move forward. It's a double edged sword.
00:37:59.572 - 00:38:18.820, Speaker A: No, I totally agree. Cool. We've been chatting almost for about 40 minutes. Are there any specific topics that you're excited by in the next coming months or coming years?
00:38:21.240 - 00:38:45.644, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so, like, the idea behind Empire Dao is way beyond just like a workspace, right? So let's think about a town square or a library or a makerspace or a skate park, right? Things that we need in our community, for our community to develop in the systems. Now, you hope that the government funding kind of works out, right? And there's not a competitive issue.
00:38:45.752 - 00:38:46.396, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:46.548 - 00:39:17.524, Speaker B: And it works in some towns, right. Sometimes it ends up being a corporation throwing a logo on there. So going back to that wagby communist capitalist concept, I foresee the next few years us finding different parts, particularly in New York City, if you're in a three block radius of a park or something, having a token around it. We're incentivized to make it better financially and for our own living, and it's a much better way of managing our local communities.
00:39:17.612 - 00:39:18.212, Speaker A: I love that.
00:39:18.276 - 00:39:57.612, Speaker B: I'm not saying we're gonna take out the whole industrial nation state model overnight by any means, but there's higher levels that work for highways and different things, federally and nationally and internationally. But we really need to focus a internationally because the nation state model is outdated. Right. So the biggest threats to society are global, whether it's AI or nuclear war, diseases like Covid type of things. These aren't nation state solvable problems, global warming, et cetera. But then. So we need to think globally, but then also act locally.
00:39:57.612 - 00:40:21.220, Speaker B: Not to sound too cliche here, but I think we have an opportunity to move a lot of our IRL stuff on chain that's not government and it's not corporate, and it's owned by us. And I think that's a beautiful future. I think there's that. This is what we're. Our vision of Empire Dao is creating that for other towns and places to be able to do the IRL stuff in a much more efficient way and make it a better world from there.
00:40:22.160 - 00:40:30.856, Speaker A: I think that's beautiful. Beautifully put. Awesome. Like any last minute things, that's it.
00:40:30.888 - 00:40:46.110, Speaker B: Man. And if you're curious about this industry, you have to jump in, you have to show up, you have to try it out. You're not going to learn it by reading about it. That'll help. But you have to experience it. And that's it. Yeah.
00:40:46.110 - 00:40:50.390, Speaker B: So I encourage everyone to tinker around as much as possible with the space and.
00:40:50.470 - 00:40:58.486, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Well, thank you so much, Mike. I appreciate your time, and I look forward to coming to Empire Dao. Awesome.
00:40:58.518 - 00:40:59.310, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Appreciate it.
