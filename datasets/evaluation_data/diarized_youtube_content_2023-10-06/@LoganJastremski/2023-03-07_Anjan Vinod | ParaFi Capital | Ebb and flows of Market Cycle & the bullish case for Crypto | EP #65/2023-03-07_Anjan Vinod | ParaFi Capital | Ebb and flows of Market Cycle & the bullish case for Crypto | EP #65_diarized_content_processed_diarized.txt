00:00:00.440 - 00:00:33.030, Speaker A: But when you look at the fundamentals, which is where I spend most of my time today, you have 100 billion plus in stablecoins, on chain changes like Coinbase have 100 million plus. Metamask has 10 million plus. Mouse. Ethereum l one, depending on how you classify it, has a few hundred k daily active users, hundreds of dapps that are. That are out there today. And then you have stuff like the merge, huge step forward in computer science and human coordination and even deFi in 2022. Really, we saw failure of human coordination and human behavior, centralized risk, counterparty risk, risk management.
00:00:33.030 - 00:01:16.472, Speaker A: A lot of the core defi, primitives, Uniswap, Aave, Makerdao, all held up very well during this volatility. So in many ways, I look at what we have today, which is hundreds of dapps, hundreds of thousands of daily active addresses. You know, a lot of this infrastructure, like stablecoins, oracles, wallets have all been built. You compare that with 2017, we had nothing, really, I mean, absolutely nothing, except trading some tokens on an exchange, and you send eth to your ICO ICO contract. So I think if you take a step back, you realize how far we've come. And I think a lot of times the media and Twitter are so focused on short term, they don't zoom out and realize how much progress we've made over the past couple years. They just focus on the failures of 2022 and don't realize, like, really the progress is like this.
00:01:16.472 - 00:01:18.100, Speaker A: It's never like, like that.
00:01:23.600 - 00:01:39.360, Speaker B: Well, today I'm super excited to be joined by Anjan, working at parafy, and all your insights into the market, what you have been thinking about, and how you've approached the last couple of years, because it's obviously been a crazy space.
00:01:39.900 - 00:01:42.660, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. Thanks so much for having me on, Logan. Looking forward to it.
00:01:42.700 - 00:02:00.560, Speaker B: Perfect. Well, I would love to start a little bit with your background. I think everybody approaches it from a different point of view. Engineers come at it from one point, traders another. So I would love personally describing how you got into the crypto world and what made you fall in love with the industry.
00:02:01.150 - 00:02:42.490, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I got into crypto first around 2016, and really one of the first use cases that stood out to me was the use case of remittances. So I was exploring sending money to family in India and other parts of the world, and there are multiple services out there, MoneyGram wire. And you pay a massive amount of fees to get the money from your bank account all the way to their bank account. There were a couple of companies at the time, including bit Pesa, that were using bitcoin as a tool to send money across borders. I thought that was super fascinating because it took far less time to settle. It was potentially cheaper.
00:02:42.490 - 00:03:41.870, Speaker A: Looking back, arguably not a great use case given the volatility of bitcoin. But again, using the blockchain rails, that was something that really stood out to me. Got into space first in 2016, really when the use case of remittances and payments focused on the bitcoin side, I would say where the space really captivated me was Ethereum around 2017. So this was right before the ICO boom, just spending time looking at different projects in this space, how some of the Ethereum roadmap items are progressing along and just kind of rode through the ICO boom as well and saw some good, a lot of bad, but ultimately came away still very bullish on this space. And so, yeah, I joined mid 2019. So coming up on four years now with parafy, and before that was involved with strategy and ops at a few startups, and then before that was doing research in the blockchain space at UC Berkeley. That's what really pulled me into the space full time.
00:03:42.330 - 00:04:21.286, Speaker B: Excellent. Yeah. The remittance use cases, I think arguably probably still the highest use case of crypto today, just with moving money from any point in the world. Unfortunate that I think bitcoin was probably not the best use for that, as you mentioned. But Ethereum during 2017 also captivated me. I was definitely a little bit later to the train than probably you were. I kind of caught the tail end of that bull cycle, but keeping with it through that bear market was probably the best thing that I could have done personally.
00:04:21.286 - 00:04:35.240, Speaker B: What decided, I mean, obviously from 2017 to 2018, I mean, most crypto assets fell 90, 95%. What got you excited personally during that timeframe to join Parafi?
00:04:36.020 - 00:05:02.902, Speaker A: Yeah, so as I was thinking about. So I knew I wanted to join the space. I mean, even with prices being down, I got in when got into the space, really before the ICO bill and before everything was about prices. And so naturally, when prices were down 80%, it starts to really test your conviction. I remember in fall 2018, bitcoin hits like three, three and a half k, and CNBC is writing articles, hey, bitcoin may be dead. We've all seen those articles. So it really tests your conviction.
00:05:02.902 - 00:05:52.058, Speaker A: So as I was thinking about opportunities in this space, obviously super nascent asset class, everything is super early. I figured a spot on the investing side lets you see the asset class grow from a macro perspective, as you think about joining opportunities in this space, you could join as a developer, you could build something, an operations person, join an early stage startup in this space. I was excited to be a part of that action, but I didn't want to silo myself into one specific vertical or project, given how early the asset class was. So I wanted to zoom out and spend time on multiple different verticals. And so when the opportunity came, you know, came up to join Parafi very, very early on. I figured kind of get the benefits of helping to build something, joining something really early on. But then my day to day job, I'm not silent on a specific vertical in crypto or specific product.
00:05:52.058 - 00:06:09.692, Speaker A: I'm looking at hundreds, thousands of different projects and opportunities. And that was super exciting. And I would say probably my favorite part of the job here at Verify is just working with our founders, supporting them, helping them work through challenges, thinking through product ideas. It's some of the most fun and creative work I've ever done.
00:06:09.876 - 00:06:30.850, Speaker B: I would totally echo all that sentiment. Definitely agree. I guess being exposed to multiple cycles now, how has your change, how has seeing these cycles play out, how has that changed your thought process, if any?
00:06:32.350 - 00:07:07.720, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So when I think about this current cycle per se, 2023, we obviously went through a rough 2022 price wise, but there's a lot of positive that came out of the space that we're going to unpack. But as you think about where we are today, crypto today is around a $1.1 trillion asset class. You back out stable coins were basically less than a trillion. I mean, this is not even, it's barely rounding error for most financial asset assets out there, stocks, bonds, real estate, et cetera. Gold itself is a $10 trillion plus asset.
00:07:07.720 - 00:07:42.370, Speaker A: All of liquid crypto, 1 trillion. We're basically at the market cap of Google, right? That includes all DeFi, all nfts, gaming, bitcoin, ethereum. We're basically at the market cap of Google. So when you compare crypto from an asset class perspective, we're still very early and very small, which is, I think, what gets everyone quite excited about this space. But when you look at the fundamentals, which is where I spend most of my time today, you have 100 billion plus and stablecoins on chain. Huge advantage that you have this on chain economy. Now, you didn't have that in the ICO days, you just had eth.
00:07:42.370 - 00:08:24.740, Speaker A: And people are saying ethic contracts changes like Coinbase have 100 million plus registered users. You probably have five to ten monthly transacting users. Metamask has 10 million plus miles. Ethereum L1, depending on how you classify it, has a few hundred k daily active users. Of course there's some overlap and some double counting with the L2s out there, but think conservatively. You can say there's a few hundred K daily active addresses on Ethereum today, hundreds of dapps that are, that are out there today. The electric Capital Developer report, I think the number was 20 or 25k monthly active developers, which I think is a great report for everyone to go check that out because it shows as the price goes down.
00:08:24.740 - 00:09:21.586, Speaker A: We still saw growth in the number of active developers, which is huge. And then you have stuff like the merge, huge step forward in computer science and human coordination, stuff like Reddit having the 5 million collectibles with their NFT product, and even DeFi in 2022. Really, we saw failure of human coordination and human behavior, centralized risk, counterparty risk management. A lot of the core defi primitives, Uniswap, Aave, makerdao, all held up very well during this volatility. So in many ways, I look at what we have today, which is hundreds of dapps, hundreds of thousands of daily active addresses. A lot of this infrastructure, like stablecoins, oracles, wallets have all been built. You compare that with 2017, we had nothing really, I mean, absolutely nothing, except trading some tokens on an exchange and you send eth to your ICO contract.
00:09:21.586 - 00:09:40.040, Speaker A: So I think if you take a step back, you realize how far we've come. And I think a lot of times the media and Twitter is so focused on short term, they don't zoom out and realize how much progress we've made over the past couple years. They just focus on the failures of 2022 and don't realize like really the progress is like this. It's never like that.
00:09:40.820 - 00:10:35.060, Speaker B: I fully, fully agree. I think ultimately, from 2018 to 2022 is night and day difference. From the product perspective. I think maker Die launched in December of 2017, but that was really only one of the few applications that was actually live. Majority of the DeFi primitives that we know and love today are mostly built throughout that bear market, and ultimately with compound kicking off defi summer kind of the catalyst for this. But yeah, totally, totally agree. One thing that I'm also very interested in is like, the daily active addresses, and I think that's probably one of the more important metrics to be looking at in this space from like a user adoption standpoint.
00:10:35.060 - 00:10:51.510, Speaker B: Going from say like low couple hundred thousands of daily active or weekly active addresses. What do you think will be the main catalysts or things that you're looking forward to to really drive adoption on chain.
00:10:52.490 - 00:11:26.142, Speaker A: I think there's a couple of, couple of different ways to answer that. From 2018 till around 2021. I think a lot of the core infrastructure really on l one S and l two s needed to be built out. An application couldn't actually support millions or tens of millions of users until you have the core block space built out. Different scalability solutions. All the infrastructure on L1 S and l two s still a work in progress. I think we're actually now finally at a point where we could support applications with seven to eight figures in terms of daily active users or mouse, it's still a little bit clunky.
00:11:26.142 - 00:12:20.026, Speaker A: It's not going to be great. But I mean, Axie had two to 3 million Daosh at its peak, which is promising. I think today there's been a lot of focus on the infrastructure, but I think what we're really missing is killer applications that people want to use outside of speculation. I look at DeFi summer, I look at the NFT craze we saw in 2020 and 2021. A lot of that was driven by speculation, even the axie infinities of the world. People were speculating and earning tokens on the playdore, I think, which is okay in the early days, but if you talk about scaling from a couple hundred thousand or a million to 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, there needs to be some other utility or long term value where people are coming on chain and participating without any speculation or any kind of immediate profit seeking behavior. I actually think a couple of different verticals could kick that off.
00:12:20.026 - 00:13:18.302, Speaker A: So I'm quite constructive on blockchain gaming, a little bit less so on just releasing a token in a new game and getting people to come on chain, but establish existing games, then implementing tokens, token economies, NFTs web3 components bringing those players on chain. I think that could actually be a massive driver in terms of new users coming on chain. I actually see in many ways defi becoming more b two b or more back then. Do I see 100 million people figuring out metamask deploying on AAVE compound? I'm not sure. I don't know if that's the ideal flow for them to come into the space versus you have a neo bank or a wallet or some product, consumer facing product that abstracts away what AavE and compound is. Just using those two examples, and you just deposit dollars or euros and you get access to the yield. That means there's actually less people coming on chain versus entities that are aggregating that activity and then posting it on chain stuff on the.
00:13:18.302 - 00:13:50.100, Speaker A: I would say social is also quite interesting. We're still trying to figure out what that exact use case is for web3 and social. But to me, when we talk about getting an absolute number of addresses on chain up, I think it's going to be more gaming social oriented in terms of capital activity, financial activity. I could see that becoming a lot more aggregated and more b two b so that we may not have 100 million addresses tied to deFi. And that's okay. We may have 10,000 large institutions using DeFi in the backend with hundreds of millions of users indirectly using DeFi.
00:13:50.680 - 00:14:38.260, Speaker B: Yeah, that all definitely makes sense. Maybe before jumping a little bit deeper into DeFi, gaming and social on a high level, I definitely agree that we are constrained by block space and now that's no longer, at least there's different alternatives to kind of scaling applications now today. How do you think about these different ecosystems more broadly and different L2s and scaling that infrastructure component? Because there has been so much money actually invested in scaling. And then happy to jump back into the more trends that we were just discussing.
00:14:39.090 - 00:15:39.790, Speaker A: Yeah, so my view right now is I think we're a little bit too early to declare an ecosystem as a winner per se. I know there are some groups out there who are almost religiously tied to one ecosystem. And my view is it's a little bit too early to say which ecosystem is going to whether it's an l one, whether it's an l two. Just given we have a couple hundred thousand people on chain. I mean, this is such a small set of users that we don't really know what the users want. So I think adoption of l one s and l two s won't be driven as much as community or sentiment like it is today. I think it'll be where do developers go? And developers are going to go to the places where, you know, performance is there, scalability is there, how easy is it to develop? Is it stable? Does the chain stay up? What are the other pieces of infrastructure or network effects that can benefit from building in this ecosystem? You don't want to build in an island, you want to build bridge or an area where there's other players involved.
00:15:39.790 - 00:16:09.000, Speaker A: So I think net net, it's a little bit too early to say who's going to win. I would say personally I'm a little bit more constructive on what I'm seeing in the Eth L two space more recently with base, but with all the stuff going on with arbitram, optimism, with TK sync, there's a lot going on there. And the network effects, with all the Ethereum infrastructure really winning as of now. Again, I think it's too early to say that Ethereum has won per se, just given how early we are in the adoption cycle.
00:16:09.340 - 00:16:53.720, Speaker B: Yeah, it totally makes sense. Yeah, totally agree there. Then maybe jumping back to some of the trends that you think will catalyze adoption, the big things, at least that you mentioned on a high level DeFi gaming and social, you talked about DeFi primarily being used as back infrastructure and maybe less people utilizing it on the front end infrastructure. Could you maybe go a little bit deeper into that? Because I definitely think that is one possibility of how things play out, but something that not very many people are actually thinking about today.
00:16:54.620 - 00:17:56.038, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is, you know, when I think about the super app thesis, or even just financial applications today, how much is actually abstracted away, whether it's wallets, like PayPal and our banking apps today, I think users want a lot of features abstracted away. I don't think they need the nitty gritty in terms of what's going on for the vast majority of users. I still think there'll be a small subset of users who want this exact functionality, a lot of customization. When you think about DeFi today, let's walk through the workflow of actually getting money on compound or out there. You have to deposit dollars in an exchange, go through that whole KYC process, open a non custodial wallet, store your private key somewhere safe, which most people can't even remember their passwords. And now you're telling them to remember this code that, this phrase that no one can help you with if you lose, move funds into the non custodial wallet, connect to the right UI, and avoid all these phishing attacks that are taking place. Deposit the right assets, manage the risk.
00:17:56.038 - 00:18:50.190, Speaker A: I mean, there's just so many layers that make it difficult for the average person to come into the space. And so I think we're going to see more wallets, more products out there that actually abstract this away, where I can just come in with dollars and say, okay, now that I have dollars here and this regulated institution as an FDIC insured bank account, they can then convert those dollars into the appropriate stablecoin. They can then deposit that stablecoin into AaVE compound or maybe one of these new permission DeFi protocols, like a Credx or centrifuge, for example. The user itself doesn't have to know which wallet do I need to use? How do I store my funds? Which stablecoin makes sense. It's all abstracted away for the end user. And then where it really gets interesting is if this wallet or product can layer on features that are complementary to the entire experience, one being insurance. Insurance has been a big missing piece of defi today.
00:18:50.190 - 00:19:22.416, Speaker A: But let's say there is a, you know, you can lend on credits today for 8910, 11%. Maybe there's an insurance layer that charges one or 2% on top of that, and then the product or wallet takes a slight cut as well. And so the user's okay paying that fee because they get insurance. A lot of the actual product itself is abstracted away. So what that could mean is DeFi is actually aggregating around a lot of these wallets, neo banks, these aggregators of capital. That's not to say that they're the ones who control deFi. That's where all activity comes.
00:19:22.416 - 00:19:35.460, Speaker A: I just think the vast majority of users will prefer that there will still be a subset of users, probably both of us, including who are more sophisticated, who are comfortable taking on the risks of using crypto, who have no problem going direct to the DeFi application.
00:19:35.880 - 00:20:50.970, Speaker B: Yeah, private key management still remains a huge challenge. I think long term, I really want private key management to be a solved issue. I think outside of exchanges, the wallet kind of will become the home for hopefully most web3 activity. And kind of what we've all originally kind of envisioned was like that self sovereignty component and being able to actually hold, whether cash or assets, nfts. But you're definitely right. It's extremely hard for a new person that's coming into the industry to remember their private key and not get attacked from any phishing attacks, let alone, as you mentioned, onboarding into some of these more complex defi primitives from that front, how are you personally looking at different comparisons between some more permission versus permissionless defi? Is it purely on the front end, or is that also including, as you were talking about earlier, with like institutions versus circularly retail?
00:20:52.070 - 00:21:49.944, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's a permission. Permission DeFi has been a big focus of ours recently. So we as a firm were very early investors in permissionless Defi. So early investors in Makerdao, Aave Uniswap, these core primitives that are very much focused on the permissionless side, who are all kind of making inroads into the permission side as well. As the market has evolved over the past year or two, we're seeing a lot more interest in permission defi given. People want some legal protection, some compliance in place, they want to have the proper guardrails. I think that's how DeFi actually scales by 100 x is when you have these proper guardrails in place and actually working with the right regulatory bodies and rules within each of your jurisdictions to make sure consumers are protected, you have the right disclosures, but you also still benefit from the advantages of DeFi in terms of transparency, tactile settlement cost, all these features which get us excited about DeFi.
00:21:49.944 - 00:22:27.800, Speaker A: So we think about permission DeFi today. One example of an investment space is Credx. And Credx has created this permissioned protocol that allows KYC borrowers and lenders to access capital in a still fairly open manner. They've done, I think, more than 30 million in originations. They just announced $150 million pool. They have a ton of borrowers in the pipeline. But the whole vision there is, look, Defi itself, the financial rails using crypto, has a ton of advantages that could disrupt the cost, the time to settlement, the transparency of existing financial rails.
00:22:27.800 - 00:22:50.548, Speaker A: They're using the advantages of crypto and Defi rails without compromising on the compliance and regulatory side. That gets large allocators, large users, regulated institutions involved. So I don't think it's either or. I don't think permission DeFi wins. Permissionless DeFi loses. I think both systems will exist in parallel. And that's really the beauty of crypto.
00:22:50.548 - 00:23:14.890, Speaker A: It's just giving people more options. There are people who are comfortable using permissionless defi, but then there are going to be institutions who want to use permission defi that's fully Kyc. They have the right compliance disclosures, and legal protections in place. But the most important component is giving people that choice and giving the market that choice. And so our view is that permission Defi will also be a big part of the entire defi stack.
00:23:16.230 - 00:23:47.520, Speaker B: Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I think that is the beautiful thing about crypto is just having that open, permissionless backend, and then people can kind of opt into whatever requirements that they really want to, whether it's, like, permissionless or permissioned, it is cool. It's very unique space. So, on the permission defi, do you think that ultimately manifests itself in permission pools, or particularly, how do you see that playing out?
00:23:48.380 - 00:24:50.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's honestly a little bit too early to say, but I think we'll see a couple of different options. One is permission pools, which we're seeing in several different protocols. Like both sides are permissioned, some protocols you're seeing. One side is permissionless, one side is fully permissioned. I think another variation is some places will just have a front end that KYC, certain individuals to access the front end, let's say us based or Europe based, whatever. That could be one scenario. The other interesting product idea that we've been exploring and talking to different entrepreneurs about is can you leverage the existing KYC infrastructure of a coinbase and binance to then kind of enhance the permissionless defi stack today? So what that could mean is a coinbase or binance, maybe they kraken or any major KYC institution or exchange issues an NFT that says, hey, we're not going to say who this person is, what their back from, but we can tell you they've been through KYC.
00:24:50.960 - 00:25:17.200, Speaker A: They're not on any OFAC list, they haven't been sanctioned. It's almost like, what's the minimum amount of information I can show on chain through a non transferable NFT or soul bound token that then allows you to access defi? So that way it's not fully permissioned or fully permissionless. I do think there are these middle grounds that actually bring together both sides quite effectively. So that's another variation we've been, we've been thinking about.
00:25:17.500 - 00:26:07.730, Speaker B: Interesting. I like that. It would be refreshing to see some of that be integrated to bring some of the more institutional players into the space and get them comfortable. But on the NFT kind of front, I think an electric capital's report, they also were stated 80% or 80 ish percent of new wallet transactions or kind of first time transactions on chain or through an NFT lens. And you also talked about gaming. Can you talk a little bit more like where your headspace is around the gaming front and nfts, did nfts surprise you and kind of the slash bull market or was it something that you guys were thinking out about kind of even prior?
00:26:08.150 - 00:26:55.566, Speaker A: Yeah. So we've been thinking about nfts for quite some time. I got my first exposure with cryptokitties back in fall of 2017. And I think what's really interesting about the gaming side is the role it's played in previous technologies, verticals in getting adoption and getting users on board. So you look at the early days of the Internet, late nineties, early two thousands. Multiplayer is invented through console based gaming, and even just online gaming like Runescape, right, explodes the, you see explosion in the number of users actually playing on chain. Same thing happens with mobile, right? You have mobile come out, you have Angry Birds clash of clans, all these mobile based games that get a ton of users into the mobile environment.
00:26:55.566 - 00:27:38.096, Speaker A: But what it also does is it keeps them there. People are going to get a mobile phone, an iPhone smartphone regardless, but it's like, what can you do? Like, it's not just call and text and email, it's like, oh, I can play these games actually living in this mobile phone more often, and then everyone starts building other apps and integrations into that. So I think we could see a similar type outcome for web3 and gaming. But web3 itself, what pulls actual new users on chain is gaming itself. Gaming is obviously a massive industry. A lot of different players out there are exploring gaming new web3 games today. What I have struggled with is just the quality of games, I think this past cycle.
00:27:38.096 - 00:28:36.978, Speaker A: To your question, what surprised me is how much funding went into pre launch or brand new games. Given games take years to launch, most games don't get a ton of funding until they get some type of traction or have some user base. Then a lot of these games are quick to launch tokens. Their token economies didn't make a ton of sense and then the token is down 90% and then people stop playing the game. So I was surprised by how quickly the market jumped on funding actual games itself. And I think what I'm keeping an eye out for is not necessarily just web3 based games that are inventing a new Call of Duty on chain, but what are the existing games that are widely popular, widely played, that can now plug in web3 components? Whether it's a token economy, whether it's like a wallet, whether it's an NFT. I mean, just today, Metamask and Unity announced that the Metamask SDK will be deployed in the Unity store.
00:28:36.978 - 00:29:13.480, Speaker A: So now if you're building on unity, you can use the Metamask SDK to integrate wallet functionality in your game natively. I mean, just the fact that users can now have a Metamask wallet is super powerful for an existing game. So I think we're at this interesting intersection where I'd like to see games that are more fun and actually build the user base and then integrate the web3 components, maybe launch a token if and when it makes sense. I think we saw a lot of games launch a token too quickly or raise funding too quickly on the premise that web3 and gaming is a massive unlock, when those specific unlocks still need to be figured out.
00:29:14.300 - 00:30:13.690, Speaker B: Totally, totally. Yeah, I think the whole token thing could probably be said for a lot of projects in the web3 space. Not only gaming, but I personally played quite a bit of runescape and also World of Warcraft. And I think, at least for others that I talked to that played those games early on, seem to be well equipped for web3 more broadly, but definitely echo the sentiments on the gaming front, I guess on a high level, because a lot of games in the vesting space, it's almost kind of winner take all. How are you personally approaching it? Are you thinking about trying to find early tractions in games, as you mentioned? Or is it just a space that you're admiring from afar as you're kind of as an onboarding tool for web3?
00:30:14.350 - 00:31:26.162, Speaker A: Yeah, so I actually think infrastructure on the gaming side is super, super interesting. So I invested in earlier on, we've invested in some NFT infrastructure, invested in an ecosystem called Internet game, which is building a lot of interesting mobile based and easy to play games for the web3 space. I would say from an investment perspective, the infrastructure is a little bit more compelling than specific games because as you know, there are thousands and thousands of games launched. Very few actually get a user base, then an even smaller subset are able to retain that user base and then tiny subset are actually able to monetize. We would rather invest in infrastructure, we're almost game agnostic and support any number of games and the infrastructure wins regardless. But growing up as a gamer myself, I haven't found many web3 games that have been a ton of fun yet. I think we're getting there, but I think that the path to launching a web3 game takes a lot more time and energy than say, launching a DeFi protocol.
00:31:26.162 - 00:31:52.244, Speaker A: There's a very clear path to launching a Defi protocol, but to launch a game, it just takes months, years, I mean, five plus years. I mean, some of the largest games outside of web3, stuff like GTA and Red Dead and Fire, just took years and massive amounts of budget. So I think we're a little bit, we're some time away from some of these games. But a vertical that I am in gaming that I am quite excited about is these easy to play indie games.
00:31:52.292 - 00:31:53.320, Speaker B: That incorporate.
00:31:55.230 - 00:32:35.454, Speaker A: If the audience hasn't checked out Internet game, I'd encourage them to check out Internet game. They have a couple of seasons of people playing these live games and their entire thesis and something that we really liked is it's not about building a Call of Duty on chain or fortnite on chain. It's about can someone just pick up a phone, play a very easy to play game, and in return they get tokens or nfts or they're part of this web3 ecosystem for playing these very easy to fund games. They're not coming in expecting Call of Duty and playing some low quality game. They're expecting an easy to pick up game that's social, that's fun, there's some financial reward tied to it, something like hq trivia. So that's like a vertical that I would say we're excited about.
00:32:35.622 - 00:32:46.330, Speaker B: I definitely agree. I think the early kind of hit games in web3 or crypto are going to look much more like among us than like Call of Duty, a lot more simplistic.
00:32:46.910 - 00:33:13.480, Speaker A: And I think that's okay. I think that's totally okay. Because I think when gamers are coming in, I don't think they're coming in or they shouldn't be coming in just because they see an NFT that they want to flip or a token that they can sell. There needs to be something fun and social that web3 uniquely enables. And there is. But if the focus is just, hey, we have an asset, you can flip or you can own this asset and you can really sell it. We haven't really found a game that people like to play.
00:33:13.480 - 00:33:18.090, Speaker A: It's. We're basically at Defi yield farming with fancy from it.
00:33:19.190 - 00:33:49.950, Speaker B: I agree there on that front. I mean, gaming is inherently social, and social is probably another prime kind of use case that blockchain could ultimately be integrated with, especially on the creator side, either supplementing or replacing income on YouTube or various other aspects. How are you personally approaching social and thinking about that area in the crypto landscape?
00:33:51.050 - 00:34:31.630, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, social is an interesting one. I think I first came across this vertical with scent back in the day. There was also steam. There were a couple of these players, and maybe they're a little bit too early, but the ideas are super interesting. Now you have stuff like lens and Forecaster, dsos, some of these different social protocols. I think when people started building in this space and when we talked to founders, a core part of the decentralized social thesis was a Twitter, Facebook, Google, all these large tech companies and social media companies are collecting your data, harvesting it, selling your data. So now come back and take ownership of your data.
00:34:31.630 - 00:34:57.094, Speaker A: I don't know if that's really resonating with the market. I don't know if there's a ton of users out there who care that much about, hey, companies are harvesting my data, they're selling my data. I think there's an ethos. I think people talk about it when you actually look at the numbers. If that's the case, why haven't we seen a ton of users migrate over? I think you've started to see a little bit of that with mastodon or Farcaster. But again, we're not talking about tens of millions of people. Right.
00:34:57.094 - 00:35:28.110, Speaker A: It's a relatively small group. Now, that could mean kind of one piece out of many that gets them to move over. The other kind of big one, I would say, is censorship resistance. With Twitter and everything we've seen in the past couple months, there is some censorship going on. And regardless of which side you're on, if you want something that's a little bit more neutral, a little bit more open, decentralized social can provide that. And then I would say users and just consumers today, I think they're going to follow the content creators, like where the content creators go. Right.
00:35:28.110 - 00:36:02.010, Speaker A: I think that's what a lot of TikTok to blow up in such a quick period of time, just given all the content creators there. And so content creators, I think, first need an incentive to move over. Then you see massive users move over. And for content creators to move over, I actually think there's value on the monetization side. Right. So, you know, everyone's kind of seen those videos and articles about people having millions of streams on Spotify, or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of views on TikTok or YouTube, and they're not making that much from that, right. From the actual platform itself, a lot of that's ad revenue, which is separate but just from the actual platform itself.
00:36:02.010 - 00:36:43.340, Speaker A: So if you're able to figure out a way to use some of the web3 rails, whether it's stablecoins, tokens, or really just nfts, you can monetize your audience in a much more effective manner. You can go after the superfans, focus on them versus trying to focus on all users. And so I think once there's a clear kind of monetary incentive for creators to move over, which I think we're getting there, you could start to see a large number of users move over. And I don't think it needs to be like 100 million people move over from TikTok to a decentralized social solution. It's how do you get the million superfans to move from TikTok to this new platform? And I think that's what the creators are going after, which is trying to get all their creators to move over.
00:36:43.840 - 00:37:29.390, Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah. I mean, I think the privacy aspect was kind of the rallying call initially. But like you said, we actually wrote an article about talking about the preferences of early adopters are normally not the same as the mass adoption, and those will most likely ultimately shift over time. And I think privacy is definitely one example of that. But the creator aspect, I think is super interesting just now, even if you, I think, look up or recent surveys have kind of shown that no longer popular job is like when you ask kids, it's not an astronaut or a doctor, it's a YouTuber or a TikToker influencer. Yeah.
00:37:29.390 - 00:38:01.578, Speaker B: So on that front, being able to kind of empower even smaller creators to monetize their work, or as you were mentioning, the superfans is going to be super fascinating in these early iterations with DSO farcaster lens. I'm super fascinated by them because I think eventually one of them will crack it and it will kind of open up the floodgates for these creators to move in. And hopefully the audience, as you mentioned, will follow as well.
00:38:01.774 - 00:39:11.262, Speaker A: Totally, yeah. And I think on the creator side, I think that the existing model is get as many followers, like subscribers as you can, you'll get some revenue directly from the platform, you'll make all your money on, most of your money on ad revenue or sponsorship, stuff like that. But I think the model that we're all that I think a lot of people in this space are thinking about is how do you focus on the superfans, the people who are willing to pay the most for your content, who really appreciate your content and really focus on them, you don't ignore the rest, but you really kind of focus on them. And that could pay dividends. To your point, a lot of the smaller creators, I mean, there are artists that we all listen to, probably have 25 maybe listeners on Spotify. They're probably making nothing from Spotify YouTube. But if you ask, let's say, if you could send a message to if you have 50k listeners, if you could pull fifty k, and you asked, how many of you would be willing to pay, you know, $100 a year to get either exclusive access to music, early access to music, early access, concert ticket, Skype session? There's so many ways that monetize their time.
00:39:11.262 - 00:39:53.600, Speaker A: Would there be at least, you know, a thousand people? So if you have 50k listeners, a thousand. So 2% of your listeners that are willing to pay $100 a year, you're selling at $100,000 a year off 2% of your user base, off a very small user base already compared to the massive artists of the world. And I think that totally shifts the revenue opportunity for careers. You don't have to get to 5 million, 10 million, these large numbers just to make a living. And what that also does is that means the actual ability to put out more content, more creative pieces of work, which is beneficial for everyone in society, increases. So people can actually do this as a side hustle or even full time if they wanted to, versus today. It's just not very sustainable.
00:39:54.180 - 00:40:37.450, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely echo all those sentiments. It's something that I'm probably one of the more exciting categories that I'm looking forward to in 2023 on that, all these, whether it's social or gaming, even defi with order books. I think going back to some of the base layer and the infrastructure components, are there any particular applications that you bias towards, like the lower latency networks or L2s that you feel like the infrastructure, like, has to be built on some of these? Or in large part, are you kind of agnostic to the base infrastructure which people build upon?
00:40:38.110 - 00:41:09.060, Speaker A: I would say we're a little bit more agnostic. I mean, obviously we have a fairly concentrated portfolio of different layer one and L2 investments. But again, going back to how early we are, I don't think the average user will care. Hey, I'm on Solana. I'm on avalanche. I'm on L2. If most of that will be abstracted away, if they have guaranteed uptime, if the security is there in the network, a lot of this will be abstracted away.
00:41:09.060 - 00:42:07.592, Speaker A: I don't think most users will need to know or understand the nuance. I mean, if we were in a state of the world where, or even take a look in 2021 for a couple hundred thousand or a few million daos, when we hit the peak in terms of on chain activity, if you ask most of them to like, hey, can you explain, like, the security and technical trade offs between Solana avalanche, these l two s? It's very confusing, right? Even in this space, there isn't definitively a right answer. It's a game of trade offs. And so with that being said, I think to build something with the expectation that users will focus intensely on the underlying l one or l two, I think, misses the broader market opportunity. Now, there are sets of applications and users, very small subset, who care a lot about which chain, which ecosystem you're developing on. But I think for an average consumer app, an average gaming app, an average social app, they won't care. Where this may really come up is.
00:42:07.592 - 00:42:36.272, Speaker A: Let's say you're talking about Defi and you're talking about, let's say there's an application building a remittance company using stable coins on chain. Where are they going to feel most comfortable settling tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars today? Arguably it's Ethereum. Maybe they have some preference for someone. Maybe they have some preference for avalanche. But I would argue that Ethereum is probably in the top three there, if not their top choice. Maybe it's a little bit of. Maybe it's primarily ethereum, maybe it's Samson, and maybe it's avalanche.
00:42:36.272 - 00:43:01.850, Speaker A: So there are maybe some high value use cases today that I think the end users, whether it's an exchange or an OTC desk, may actually prefer to settle on something that's arguably seen as more secure, more decentralized, which is a whole other topic. But I think like a couple of years on the line, if we expect users to, the average user to dig through and understand the security trade offs between different l one s and l two s, I feel like we haven't made as much progress as we should have as an industry.
00:43:02.910 - 00:43:38.180, Speaker B: I definitely agree there. I think ultimately people won't care. I think where they will care, and maybe slightly pushing back is just prices in terms of gas fees and then also the real world latencies where some of that stuff can't be abstracted away. I guess if you were slightly removed, I guess some of those could be. But other than that, do agree that most people won't care. But if there's high gas fees, I think people will have a little bit of an issue with things.
00:43:38.720 - 00:44:17.414, Speaker A: Well, even in a couple of years, I don't know if l ones would be able to compete on gas. Gas fees today are already incredibly, incredibly low. And so if the view is like, hey, we're going to be able to sustainably compete just on gas fees, I don't know if that's enough. Maybe, maybe it's a question of how much, right. If you're like 10% or 20% cheaper than an alternative, will people move over just from that? If you're ten x or 100 x cheaper? I mean obviously it's completely different, but yeah, I agree. I mean, I think the end customer, like assuming we're in a state of the world where gas fees aren't 100 x different, right? If you know, one chain is 0.01, the other chain is like 0.0,
00:44:17.414 - 00:44:19.650, Speaker A: you know, we're all really low.
00:44:20.520 - 00:44:54.258, Speaker B: I personally do think that there's going to be hundred x differences in some of these chains, but that goes down a very technical rabbit hole. But I do think there will be some differences. There's a lot of small minute details that people and trade offs of the architectures, which unfortunately I think as investors we have to know. But the retail definitely won't care and shouldn't care even on the decentralization front. But yeah, that gets down a whole other rabbit hole.
00:44:54.354 - 00:44:57.070, Speaker A: Probably do a round two on that. Sure.
00:44:58.090 - 00:45:18.946, Speaker B: But a couple other things that we briefly talked about initially were remittances. I think one company that you paraphy recently invested in was Tipin. Could you share a little bit more on your thoughts there and how TIPN will play a little bit of a role on just payments more broadly?
00:45:19.138 - 00:45:29.310, Speaker A: So tippin, do you mean like the, like the proof physical work, like token incentivize physical infrastructure networks, or like just a specific company that's, I believe it is a company.
00:45:29.970 - 00:45:31.306, Speaker B: Maybe I'm mistaken.
00:45:31.498 - 00:45:55.452, Speaker A: No, no, all good. We didn't invest in a company called Token. It's more so like the label for like proof of physical work, like token incentive physical infrastructure network. But on remittances itself, I mean as we think about just the landscape itself, we think stablecoins are obviously going to benefit a ton from this. There was actually a really interesting article that Uniswap put out. Encourage everyone to go check that out. I think it was a couple of weeks ago.
00:45:55.452 - 00:46:46.232, Speaker A: They talk about forex and remittances and some of the value, the benefits you get from using stablecoins. That's something that's been in the back of my mind. Why haven't stablecoins really cracked remittances, e commerce or payments? Like using USCC to buy coffee, it doesn't really exist anywhere. Like, yeah, the conferences, people download their wallet and I think that's maybe a lot of this comes down to the large users of stablecoins today. Whether it's people in developed countries, exchanges, market makers, they don't need to use stable coins, they have access to credit, they get paid by institutions to buy things. But stable coins haven't really work their way down through developing countries. I think they are some of the stuff that's going on in Venezuela and Argentina, like they're starting to get down there.
00:46:46.232 - 00:47:24.470, Speaker A: But that could just be a massive unlock for users, especially in those countries. And an interesting stat is last year stablecoins and I think specifically USDC settled something like 8 trillion of value. Visa did something like 14 trillion in value in terms of the total kind of volume that was transacted in the network. I mean, those are insanely high numbers for a very small set of users. Like we spoke about a couple hundred thousand users. Like, what happens when that number is 5 million, 10 million? Like, how big can the Siebel coin volume really get?
00:47:24.890 - 00:47:59.310, Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah. No, it is fascinating. I mean, even, like, looking at the Opensea volumes for how many users they have or even uniswap up, I think last time I checked, both of those had less than 5 million total active addresses that have ever interacted with their contracts, but have done billions and billions of volume. Pretty insane. The market has definitely shifted, though, from 2021, definitely bull market. And then lots of things change.
00:47:59.310 - 00:48:24.080, Speaker B: Lots of deleveraging events in 2022. And from a founder perspective, this also has some pretty big changes in how they approach their business and how they even go about fundraising. So could you talk about a little bit about how you're communicating with the founders that you work with on the landscape and how the environment has changed more broadly?
00:48:24.420 - 00:49:06.540, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. This is definitely top of mind and where we're spending most of our time right now just supporting our founders, a couple of areas come to mind. So as we think about just Runway and treasury management, this wasn't really top of mind for the entire space. People always felt like they were one round away. They didn't have to worry about Runway and burn or really expenses because there's so much capital in the space, so much fraud. You saw kind of pre, I'm sure as you guys are looking at opportunities as well, pre launch deals, insane valuations that today aren't even getting done. And so we've been emphasizing the founders, like, really focus on Runway, really focus on burn.
00:49:06.540 - 00:50:09.720, Speaker A: What that can mean is, you know, cutting costs on the personnel side, cutting costs with service providers. The other big area is just simply counterparty risk, like, where are you storing your funds? So during the FTX kind of debacle, we were on calls, our founders all times of the day and night, just helping them find new solutions. And many times, one of the most fascinating takeaways I had from that is one of the only solutions they had was gnosis safe or metamask. They couldn't get another exchange in time, or there was some issue, and it's like, again, it shows you the power of crypto. At a time when no other exchange or every broker or every kind of centralized player in the space was facing challenges, metamask or a gnosis safe or any non custodial wallet phantom, they were there to support these businesses and entities, and there were a lot of companies in the space that had to move funds to a metamask. Or a safe, just to make sure everything is safe. So that's a big focus of, I would say that we're pushing on a lot of the founders today.
00:50:09.720 - 00:51:11.236, Speaker A: Another one is just proper financial discipline and reporting. I think this was another big gap in the market the past couple of years. Do you have proper income statements? Balance sheet? Are you keeping track of all of your expenses? Are you projecting out your expenses in the most effective manner? Are you accounting for different scenarios? Assuming you don't hear your revenue targets or there's a massive loss on the customer side, are you accounting for these different scenarios and planning for the worst? Assume you can't raise for the next two, three years. Are you good to go? These are all the scenarios where helping founders think through, and then that's more on the fundraising, treasury management side. The other big area that I've been spending a lot of time on is really product. So in 2021 and in 2020, I would say the first half of 2022, a lot of teams were launching products, whether it's defi nfts gaming, and I think now they look back and they say, hey, wait a second, that idea or this product doesn't really have product market. Fitzhen.
00:51:11.236 - 00:52:10.758, Speaker A: It may have been driven by a speculation driven user base. The activity may have been driven by short term token incentives or may have just been driven by prices being higher. If you're a money market, for example, and people want to borrow for leverage now, I think a lot of founders, which is very healthy for the space, are reevaluating their product roadmap. What do end users actually want? How differentiated is my product? Do I actually need a token, if I need a token for this protocol to survive, it probably doesn't have product market fit and there's some serious underlying issues. So just helping founders think through pivots and what are some new market opportunities to go after, which is a big positive for the space. I think the fact that we're in this bear market, I think you'd mentioned this earlier, some of the best companies are going to be building Opensea uniswap compound makerdao. So many large winners, quote unquote, were built during the bear market because it forces you to be focused, forces you to be disciplined, and you can't be distracted and go after different products.
00:52:10.758 - 00:52:14.170, Speaker A: You have to be very focused. So I think we're seeing that across the board, which is positive.
00:52:14.670 - 00:53:09.160, Speaker B: Yeah. All wise words of wisdom. Yeah, I think burn rate is definitely a big one. And then if you, I would say there's, I don't know it's even. I mean, I guess from the volume standpoint you could debate or there's definitely products that have found product market fit further. In large part, there's very few applications that are concretely or none on the web two scale, but on the crypto scale, there's definitely a handful but not hundreds or thousands that have found product market fit. On that front, is there any particular things that you, when talking with founders, kind of give them advice on, or is it kind of just like ideating on like product marketing, all kind of the normal stuff that kind of goes into trying to get a loyal fan base.
00:53:09.700 - 00:54:19.700, Speaker A: So I think it varies if a product has been launched or it's not launched, it's a pre launch date. So if you look at a product that has been launched, if you're assessing what is the current status of my product and should I pivot or should I continue down this path, we spend a lot of time looking at what is the actual activity and usage of the product. Who is actually using your product in a protocol, sometimes very difficult to see, but also sometimes a lot easier to see than a traditional company because everything's on chain and you can kind of see like who are the large users of the protocol? Do you know who they are? Can you talk to them to understand why they're actually using the protocol? How concentrated is the activity? Right. A lot of times in DeFi protocols, you saw like ten wallets account for the vast majority of activity that can kind of give a sign that you have product market fit. And then the next layer is asking them what is incentivized versus unincentivized activity. Are they using this because there is some incentive that's being provided either by you through a token, through some subsidized rate. Is there a partner providing incentives or there is some incentive mechanism in place that's keeping them there? Or is it unincentivized activity, which I think is a true sign of product market fit, which is they're just using it because there's simply a better product.
00:54:19.700 - 00:55:00.244, Speaker A: So that's a big component. I would say the other component is just what does the competitive landscape look like? If there's anything we've noticed over the past year or so is a bunch of founders are pivoting into new categories. How competitive is your space right now? Just using an example, if you're trying to launch a Dex on Ethereum right now, or a money market, it's a massive uphill battle. It's just an absolutely massive uphill battle. I think there are dozens of verticals like that that are in similar spots. That's something else we've been pushing and understanding product differentiation. And I would say like if a product is pre launch, this is where we've been pushing a lot of founders to understand, you know, go talk to customers.
00:55:00.244 - 00:55:42.732, Speaker A: If you're a DeFi protocol, it's very easy to figure out who are the large, you know, defi users out there. Whether it's funds, exchanges, market makers, large users, set up interviews with them, just get their feedback. I think after 1020 different interviews and calls you get a good sense for what are people actually looking for? What does the customer want? And I think in web3 there hasn't been as much of a focus on the customer or the end user than there has been a traditional web two startups or traditional software startup. And I think tokens distorted a lot of activity. Token came out and suddenly your TVL is up into the right and you think, wow, there's product markets, people are using it. And so now we're saying, okay, don't launch your token too quickly. Figure out what your customer actually wants.
00:55:42.732 - 00:55:47.100, Speaker A: If and when a token makes sense, maybe consider it, but it shouldn't be the default.
00:55:47.640 - 00:56:25.320, Speaker B: 100%. 100%. When I was leading product at Tesla for the supercharging network, we'd often call charging customers and just talk with them. And I think some of the stuff from the web two world that was kind of commonplace has been forgone. When number goes up too quickly or the wrong incentives are in place, it's a great reminder to go back to the basics, talk to your customers, call them and actually learn why they're using the products. I think it's very valuable advice looking.
00:56:25.360 - 00:56:54.888, Speaker A: For the web two side. One point I would make on that is just think about LTV and CAC. LTV and CAC. Every SaaS startup out there is looking at that like lifetime value versus customer acquisition cost then now a lot of protocols out there that are emitting tokens. If that's their CAC, they're giving several dollars away. The lifetime value is how Much in Fees or some type of metric I'm getting or ROI I'm getting back. They're spending like $5 to get a dollar of fees or value.
00:56:54.888 - 00:57:15.630, Speaker A: It's not a great, it's not a great ratio, right? I think people haven't really done that work for a lot of protocols, which is sure you're giving away tokens to acquire new users, extend ownership, etcetera. But if you're giving away a lot more than you're actually benefiting, then we should revisit that. So that's another area that I think.
00:57:15.710 - 00:58:07.132, Speaker B: Is relevant to a lot of founders. I mean, definitely in the bull market just kind of speed ran the ideal, why can't I say it? The maze of ideas. Let's just say that the idea. Yeah, correct. And I think part of that was also experimenting with tokens and everything that we ultimately watched unfold in the 2020, 2021 bull market. And, yeah, definitely wise words to kind of go back to the basics, talk with your customers, but looking forward to kind of like 2023. I mean, we obviously talked on, like, high level, like, categories and like, even like, went a little bit more granular into each of them.
00:58:07.132 - 00:58:19.440, Speaker B: But is there anything particular that you're excited about for 2023 and what you're, like, keeping a keen eye out for?
00:58:20.220 - 00:58:51.894, Speaker A: Yeah, a ton going on, and I wish there were, you know, obviously podcasts like youre a are covering a lot of the fundamentals and a lot of the substance, but I wish a lot of the media publications are doing the same. Yeah, there's a ton to unpack there. I continue to be very excited about DeFi, both in permissionless DeFi, but also permission Defi. Like, we discussed a lot going on there. There are a lot of institutional allocators that are looking at the space, and people think like, hey, with the FTX situation, they're no longer there. They moved on. That's not what we're seeing.
00:58:51.894 - 00:59:36.840, Speaker A: There's a lot of sophisticated institutions who, with permission DeFi, or even with permissionless DeFi, can't ignore the value, whether it's transparency, cost, time to settlement of DeFi. And so these sophisticated institutions aren't just backing away when prices go down. They're doing their work understanding the fundamentals. I think it's going to be huge for the space. I would say a couple other themes that really stand out, I continue to leave. Stable coins are arguably crypto's killer use case, and we're just scratching the surface there. So regulated, collateralized, stable coins, getting them in the hands of people that really need them, whether in developing countries or people just want access to 24/7 money, I think will continue to be a big driver of crypto usage and adoption.
00:59:36.840 - 01:00:21.688, Speaker A: Excited about a lot of the stuff going on the identity side. I think this is a super underappreciated vertical of, of crypto. So when I look at what's going on with ens or even layer three or some of these protocols, I think identity has been a big missing part of crypto. And I think a lot of these primitives are starting to be here and starting to be built that actually enables the next wave of DeFi web through gaming social. Once you have identity, that supercharges DeFi, that supercharges social, that supercharges web through gaming in a way that, you know, the existing system just doesn't, doesn't scale. So that's another interesting vertical t pins or token. Incentivized physical infrastructure networks are also called proof of physical work.
01:00:21.688 - 01:00:50.164, Speaker A: I think again, a super underrated part of the crypto stack. There's the heliums, hivemappers of the world, weatherexm, all these protocols that are issuing tokens to get people to do stuff in the physical world, lay down certain infrastructure, buy a device, provide some service. We're in the early days, I know there's a lot of criticisms around, hey, the tokens are distributed, what's the use case for the token? Are these models sustainable? But I actually think there's a path forward there that's super interesting.
01:00:50.332 - 01:00:57.140, Speaker B: We could probably do an entire podcast just on the real world incentives that tokens could play in.
01:00:57.260 - 01:01:33.456, Speaker A: Totally, yeah, it's fascinating to see with helium today they laid a, what was it, hundreds of thousands of hotspots in the IoT side. I think they have thousands on the 5g side for T mobile dish. I mean we have to see what the demand side looks like and how the network actually performs and relative to centralized components. But this is a brand new paradigm, like getting people to do stuff in the physical world through incentive has always been something that's very difficult to do. And I think that's enabled with crypto payments. With tokens, it doesn't even have to be a new token. It could even be stable coins.
01:01:33.456 - 01:02:16.370, Speaker A: Like if a company wants a large set of users to do something, paying them in a micro via micropayment in a very quick manner is a lot easier than, hey, I'll give you a referral code or I'll give you like 10% off, or here's a gift card. How does just using an example, if you're Google and you want more concrete images for Google Maps, similar to what Hivemapper is doing, how do you pay millions of people in a very scalable manner? I mean, you're just going to wire people money, ach money. So even the stablecoin rails itself can be plugged into some of these existing web two companies. I wouldn't be surprised if we see something like that.
01:02:17.030 - 01:02:37.790, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, perfect closing thoughts. Really appreciate you coming on the podcast. Appreciate you sharing all your thoughts and kind of historical point of view, and also what you're excited about going forward. If there's anybody that wants to get in touch with you or get in touch with parafy, what's the best way to do so?
01:02:38.130 - 01:02:54.458, Speaker A: Yeah, I think probably the best way is just DM me on Twitter. You can keep my DM's open. You can reach out if you want to chat more, if there's anything else I can help with. But yeah, this was super fun. Loganhouse, appreciate you having me on, and it's a really fun conversation.
01:02:54.634 - 01:02:56.170, Speaker B: Appreciate it. Likewise. Thank you.
