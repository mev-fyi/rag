00:00:00.320 - 00:00:00.912, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:01.046 - 00:00:08.814, Speaker B: Well, welcome, Jack. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Truly a pleasure. I really appreciate it.
00:00:08.942 - 00:00:15.142, Speaker A: No, absolutely. Thank you, Logan. Yeah. Very grateful to be here. Happy to have the chance to speak with you.
00:00:15.326 - 00:00:37.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it'd be maybe funny just to start out. We met briefly. I met the team in New York showing my podcast to you guys to try to come on and met with Tiff, and then later kind of helped with the podcast set up between you and, uh, Raj or the magic Eden team and, uh, Raj, which was just super funny.
00:00:37.482 - 00:01:12.824, Speaker A: That was actually amazing. Yeah. So, uh, life, man. Life is long. The world is small, you know, like, uh, yeah, so first of all, we met in New York, and then, like, uh, we were having breakfast with Raj in New York, like, just before the podcast, and Tiff was like, oh, you know, we have someone here who's, like, a yemenite who's a pro at. Wow, Tiff, you're, like, really organized, you know, a lot of people, and we roll up, we go to, like, Raj's room. I meet you, and then, like, I was like, oh, man, this guy's like, yeah, he's got, like, a really fucking pro.
00:01:12.824 - 00:01:39.700, Speaker A: Like, you know, all these cameras. I was like, man, this guy knows what he's doing. And afterwards, I was like, this dude is a legit, like, crypto dj. And it's like, talk about, like, proof of history, consensus arguments to Raj. And I was like, I feel so dumb in this conversation my way out later on, and then I realized that you just met us, like, serendipitously. Right?
00:01:40.520 - 00:01:41.816, Speaker B: It happened by chance.
00:01:41.968 - 00:01:50.734, Speaker A: Yeah. It wasn't like, you know, like, Tiff was hiring for a podcast person or something. You pulling yourself out for that. It was just a serendipitous thing.
00:01:50.832 - 00:01:51.538, Speaker B: I know.
00:01:51.674 - 00:02:01.378, Speaker A: Number two, I was like, man, this is crazy that the NFT and crypto community just, like, it just brings everyone together. This is, like, what you kind of live for, right? These kind of stories.
00:02:01.554 - 00:02:14.066, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly. It was super cool and glad that everything has kind of worked out how it has. It is pretty wild. Cool.
00:02:14.258 - 00:02:16.550, Speaker A: Later on, we met at the pizza party.
00:02:16.730 - 00:02:18.730, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you for that invite.
00:02:19.350 - 00:02:23.278, Speaker A: And then we nerded out some more and then a lot of mutual friends.
00:02:23.334 - 00:02:56.128, Speaker B: You know, it is a small world. Small world, for sure. Well, yeah. Again, thank you. I think what I try to do, and I just maybe just start off with, like, a little bit more so about, like, your background as a whole and how you got into crypto, because I think everybody kind of comes at it from a different angle. Which I really appreciate holistically. I kind of describe crypto as a black hole because some people are coming in from the NFT side, some people are coming from the finance side, some people come from the tech side.
00:02:56.128 - 00:03:03.944, Speaker B: It's just there's so many avenues to kind of get into the entire ecosystem. I find it fascinating how people kind of started their journey in crypto.
00:03:04.112 - 00:03:26.570, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I'm happy to share a little bit about the story. It's actually the. I think everyone's story is a little bit of an s band. Right. Mine was definitely the same, so mine actually started 2013. My CTO, like, I'm a co founder right now, Sydney.
00:03:26.570 - 00:03:53.282, Speaker A: We actually grew up together in Australia, so I knew. I've known him since high school, when they're, like, high school tutoring together. Like, we were friends and kept in touch throughout all of this time. And in 2013, he actually started a bitcoin company. It was like the inferior or alchemy of crypto, of bitcoin, the bitcoin blockchain. So it was building, like, a developer toolkit to interact with the bitcoin blockchain. And at that time, I was still in university.
00:03:53.282 - 00:04:28.894, Speaker A: I was kind of in, like, my final years, and I was studying law. So out of the three, finance, tech, like, it was none of that. I came from a law background. So at that time, I was into startups, but my main training was around law. And then I saw my friend, like, Sid, do this bitcoin thing. And at that time, I also attended this lecture by this guy called, his last name is Lessig. He's like a cyber law pioneer, talking about the law of the Internet.
00:04:28.894 - 00:05:01.130, Speaker A: And he was like a Harvard law professor. And he had this framework that resonated with me a lot, which is he said, hey, ultimately, law is like a human construct. This thing doesn't really have to fundamentally exist in the world. What needs to fundamentally exist in the world is just a way to regulate behavior for us to say what's right or wrong. And law is just a construct that we invented to regulate that kind of behavior. But there are other ways of regulating people's behavior. Number one is law.
00:05:01.130 - 00:05:39.430, Speaker A: Number two is the market. Like supply and demand, human motives, proffer seeking motives. Right? Number three is, like, norms and values. And number four is the environment. So the environment means, like, if you have a lock, like a door and a lock on it, then the environment is telling you, like, the other person is not allowed to come in, right. And then he was positing this point to say, hey, on the Internet, there is no law because it's just very new. But with the blockchain, because the Internet has no law, you have to use the environment to regulate what's right and wrong.
00:05:39.430 - 00:05:49.150, Speaker A: And with the advent of blockchain, this is going to be, like, the way that new environments and new norms are going to get built on the Internet. And I was pretty mind blown.
00:05:49.490 - 00:05:50.618, Speaker B: That is crazy.
00:05:50.754 - 00:06:24.688, Speaker A: Yeah. So for me, I was always into tech, and a lot of people are into tech optimists. They are optimists about the, you know, the exponential change that tech can create. So I was already willing to believe that, like, this technology will do something. But then I heard about this, like, way of understanding, like, what is, like, jurisprudence and how society and norms are regulated. I was like, holy shit. This blockchain thing, like, if this really does live up to the potential what this technology can do, it really is going to upend, like, so much of what we think.
00:06:24.688 - 00:06:49.750, Speaker A: And that's when I. Everyone has, I think a lot of folks in crypto, they say they fall down a rabbit hole. There is a rabbit hole of, like, making money. There's a rabbit hole of building apps, but a lot of people fall down the rabbit hole of, like, some idealistic philosophy thing that is. That is triggering them. And that was it for me. Right, 2013, when I went to that lecture, and then when I saw, like, one of my best friends do his bitcoin thing, I was like, holy shit, I gotta pay attention to this.
00:06:49.750 - 00:06:56.070, Speaker A: Then the rest of the next few years. Wasn't that interesting, to be really honest.
00:06:56.370 - 00:06:59.918, Speaker B: Yeah, 2013 was super early. It's really early.
00:07:00.014 - 00:07:33.438, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So soon he went to start this company called Helloblock. He raised some money in Boston, and I went to see him for a little bit. I was kind of, like, helping out, do a little bit of work, but it was pretty clear it was too early. So I left him to, like, go down with the ship, and I, like, pulled up and I went back to Australia, went into consulting just to get some fundamentals. And then I always wanted to come back to the US. So with my consulting shop in Australia, I asked for, like, a transfer to the US.
00:07:33.438 - 00:08:16.340, Speaker A: I came to Silicon Valley, then, like, pulled the plug pretty quickly afterwards and I joined Google. But throughout that whole time, I was dabbling in crypto and I was watching it really closely and I was like, you know, you buy into fucking icos and I gambling buy all of this stuff. And I just really wanted to find a way in. After my time at Google, I was trying to learn about product management, because I had never done it before. I did my three years and at the end I took this product from zero to pretty big in revenue. And I thought, okay, I've done everything I needed to do. No more logo collecting time to do what I really want.
00:08:16.340 - 00:08:26.080, Speaker A: And that was when I decided to jump into crypto full time. I actually left the Bay Area, joined FTX in Hong Kong.
00:08:26.420 - 00:08:26.900, Speaker B: Nice.
00:08:26.980 - 00:09:05.302, Speaker A: And at that time, I could have joined a lot of different crypto companies. I really wanted to join some. I really wanted to join a company that what I thought really understood crypto culture, really got it. And I just thought the way that FTX did everything at that time, there was still very small, maybe like 50 people or so. I just thought that, hey, these guys really understand how the game is played and they know how the community, like, how to talk to the community, how to engage. And that was really attractive for me. So I jumped in and went to FTS and the story then there was like, basically with magic, Eden was like, went to FTX.
00:09:05.302 - 00:09:40.870, Speaker A: FTX major Solana supporters. I saw, like, the Solana ecosystem rise up from under the hood. Right from the outside, you kind of feel like, oh, this just feels like another l, one that's getting hyped. But from under hood, I really saw, like, wow, there's like, a lot of talent coming in. There's a lot of capital that's flowing in. And really this seems to be a chain that's living up to the technical aspirations that it was saying. So got pretty excited and yeah, after that, basically squatted up with these guys to start Niger Eden, you know, when.
00:09:40.910 - 00:10:22.276, Speaker B: The NFT thing kicked off, that's amazing. That's a awesome story. Lots of, I don't know. I always say, like, in retrospect, it all looks easy. Looking into the ecosystem in 2013, then going and keeping with it, but still getting your wings sharpened with joining big companies and then ultimately being on the ground enough to know, like, which players are knowledgeable, joining that company, continuing to learn, and then ultimately deciding to do your own thing. In retrospect, everybody's like, oh, yeah, it's obvious. But, like, in hind, like, at the point in time, like, they're very difficult decisions.
00:10:22.276 - 00:10:27.360, Speaker B: Like, and it's not always easy to, like, choose the correct path. So it's very impressive.
00:10:27.700 - 00:10:46.596, Speaker A: Oh, no. I mean, I don't know whether it's impressive. Who knows how the story will end, but I do. I think you definitely hit on the nail. Like, there's many, you know, when we talk about these things, it's only the highlights. Right? You talk about, like, the big tldrs, but actually, it's all the micro stuff in the movie. Pivotal change.
00:10:46.596 - 00:11:01.284, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, like, for me, like, I was probably never a guy that's well suited to Google. Like, I love hustling. Like, I love, like, kicking down doors, blowing shit up. That's kind of, like, my style. And I'm not, like, the most polished dude ever.
00:11:01.332 - 00:11:01.920, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:02.320 - 00:11:57.866, Speaker A: Google is much more like the blue chip of web two kind of situation. But at the same time, I'm like, I was very grateful for my time there. Not just the skills I learned, but to your point, like, there were some pivotal moments that I learned a lot about myself and learned a lot about myself in terms of. One of the things that was very relevant to this whole crypto journey was at that time, I got into Google and I just felt like, hey, I was always a guy that was very impatient. I wanted a lot of shit. Like, now Google, it's like the worst for impatient people because everything was really slow. And then through that period, I learned this thing about, if you are really chasing the thing that you really want, you should be comfortable in your own skin with the decisions that you make.
00:11:57.866 - 00:12:10.826, Speaker A: And if you are, if you're just, like, working towards the thing that you really want, time doesn't matter because time and, like, chasing something, they're almost like trying to hit vanity metrics for someone else, right?
00:12:10.898 - 00:12:11.522, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:12:11.546 - 00:12:23.896, Speaker A: If you're really comfortable with doing the thing that's in your heart, you should just do it and don't worry about time. And that was, like, such a fundamental thing I learned from my time at Google, which I took to all of these big decisions later on.
00:12:23.928 - 00:12:49.048, Speaker B: Even in crypto, I wholeheartedly agree with that. It takes time, though. It's not something you take a step and then you take another step and you learn that and get braver by each steps that you do. So, yeah, no kudos. It is a difficult thing, maybe, to segue a little bit. You talked about culture and the web3. Culture, web3.
00:12:49.048 - 00:13:07.260, Speaker B: Native culture. I guess, like, touching upon that. How would you describe web3 holistically to people that are not as deep into the different aspects and maybe segue into their kind of how you view nfts holistically?
00:13:09.400 - 00:13:18.500, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a broad question. Yeah, broad. And always give me the tricky questions. Man, those softballs.
00:13:19.360 - 00:13:30.480, Speaker B: I just start with how you kind of see web3 emerging versus, like, web two. I think you kind of, like, touched upon it with the difference.
00:13:30.820 - 00:14:08.144, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll share a story, which is like, so to me, like web3, the culture is still being formed, but there's like some tenants of it or some manifestations of it that people seem to be converging around, right? More things will emerge, things will change and magic. Eden. We have like really strong cultural values that we don't. We try really hard to say, these are not slogans. These are things that we live through, our actions. One of the most important cultural values is web3 over web two. And what that means is every day when you start a company, you can do whatever you want.
00:14:08.144 - 00:14:44.400, Speaker A: Life is like a blank piece of paper. But whatever we do, if there's a web3 way of trying to do it, we'll try to do it the web3 way. Of course, like, there are no hard rules in business and there's no hard rules in life, right? Like, it's very hard to always do the web3 way. It's just impossible, like most a lot of the time. But to us, the web3 way means community over centralization, right? Where you impact a lot of people. And like, you have a way of like just making a snap decision like this, or you want to seek the community's feedback and have a two way dialogue. Do it the community way.
00:14:44.400 - 00:15:20.528, Speaker A: The second thing for us is that it means partnerships overdo everything yourself because it really is like the web two way seems to be like, hey, let's build a full stack, every single product, monopolize all of the value. But I think web3 is underlying this partnership mentality is like, dude, we're all fucking working it out ourselves. And everyone who bet their career into web3 is actually not betting on like, I'm going to take more than someone else. Everyone is actually betting that web3 is going to be 1000 x bigger a couple of years from now than what it is today.
00:15:20.664 - 00:15:21.424, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:15:21.552 - 00:16:10.030, Speaker A: If that's the way, then we are okay to give shine and to share and to partner with other folks. That's okay with us. And we don't have to do everything ourselves. So that's partnerships over billions of number three. For us, it means grassroots over top down. So to me, we get pitched big sexy ip deals every day from really famous brands, institutions and stuff like that. But at the same time, I always feel that the innovation is coming from the grassroots, the ground level folks who really bet their whole time and career in here and they don't have a lot of resource, but all they have is their creativity and all that is their courage.
00:16:10.030 - 00:16:49.452, Speaker A: And whenever people say, like, what's the best project or the most proud project you've partnered with at Vegeta. I'd say Belugi's, which is like a 14 year old girl, she believed in like, saving whales, saving belugis. And she starts this NFT collection, raise a million dollars. Then like next week she's flying this check across the ocean to donate at this wildlife conservatory. That's insane. It's like someone who has all the innocence to be able to dream and then uses this technology to make a change in the world and actually does it. To me, that is grassroots innovation, people who really take that leap of faith and we like that.
00:16:49.452 - 00:17:25.320, Speaker A: That's what to us, that's what we were to. And the last tenor for us is called Djens over polish. And that to me is how we create the culture and the team at magic Eden. What that means to me is when we say people use dJNs in crypto as a term of irreverence, but to us, to me, degens is a term of respect. DGNs means it's someone who really gets the crypto culture. And for us, we prefer to work with DJNs over polished people. Because what's really important to magic Eden is that we need to understand our users.
00:17:25.320 - 00:17:59.062, Speaker A: That is at the heart of every company, whether it's web one, web two, web3, that principle will always remain true. You need to understand what your users want. And we therefore want to have that lifeblood inside the company so that we always had that in our DNA. So today we could highlight the head of sales from Oracle, whatever, from all these big dog companies, but we'd much rather have folks who are actually from the community coming magic Eden. And actually like 30% of the people at Magic Eden are like collection founders. NFT collection founders. And we're like very, very proud of that.
00:17:59.062 - 00:18:01.170, Speaker A: We're very intentional about preserving that.
00:18:01.870 - 00:18:03.090, Speaker B: No, that's amazing.
00:18:03.550 - 00:18:04.486, Speaker A: Three over one, two.
00:18:04.518 - 00:18:46.866, Speaker B: You know, like, that's, I think you nailing it and. Yeah, I mean, I think, like, you touched upon a lot of points, especially the community aspect. And community, like, to me, ultimately is the lifeblood of the company. And how intentional you are about setting that culture and propagating those values throughout the community and the company and even the entire ecosystem shapes a lot. And it's awesome to hear how intentional you are about setting those values and propagating them through the entire ecosystem. That's very cool. Yeah.
00:18:46.866 - 00:19:20.386, Speaker B: And then you. Yeah, no, it's. I think that's kind of lays it up. Well, maybe like kind of just touch upon why magic Eden decided to go into NFT specifically versus like, when I was at Tesla, I was watching all the stuff at DeFi, summer happened and I thought everybody would love Defi. Like, they're doing uniswaps. Like people are filled farming, like all these different food tokens, things are going nuts. And I was like, this is it.
00:19:20.386 - 00:19:40.100, Speaker B: This is going to be the moment. Like Defi, everybody's going to come on board. And it did happen in some sense, but once nfts happen, like, everything really changed. So maybe talk about just like your, and the company and your other co founders decisions to pursue nfts as a whole and what you think about those.
00:19:40.640 - 00:20:22.882, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it is a combination of opportunity and skillset. But first and foremost, I think it's a team and skillset kind of thing. I think for me, I have this belief that, man, if you put the right team there, everything starts with a team, because if you have the right team, then nothing is impossible. It's just hard. And then like, but you could do anything you want. You just have to focus, keep at it, put one step in front of the other and try to walk in the right direction. But a lot, for a lot of companies, if you don't have the right team, a lot of things are just impossible.
00:20:22.882 - 00:20:49.010, Speaker A: It's just like not on the table to do right. So to your question of why nfts, I really felt like we had the right team to go and execute on our vision of what it should be. It starts off with myself and Joseon. We spent a lot of time in crypto, in exchanges. I spent time in FTX. He was Coinbase employee number to a Dy DX. So he was a crypto OG.
00:20:49.010 - 00:21:27.782, Speaker A: If you think about NFT marketplaces, the business model is very similar to a crypto exchange, very similar dynamics. You have primary issuance, which is like our launch pad. Then you have like secondary trading, which is like a listings kind of game and exchanges. And it's very partnerships driven. Right? Like you're a hub in the ecosystem, so you partner with a lot of people. So we understood that from like a business dynamics market structure perspective. And then my two other co founders, Sid, who's our CTO, and Rex, who's our chief engineer, they came, they were like Uber OGs.
00:21:27.782 - 00:22:22.490, Speaker A: So Sid was like employee, like the founding engineer of Uber Eats when it was a design file, and he left the app doing billions of dollars in GMV. And Rex, Rex was his colleague, early OG colleagues. And they used to stay late in the office together. Very early Uber warrior, so they understood how to build a marketplace really well. So if we understand the business model stuff from the exchange and how to get the company going, they understood the features, the product features that you kind of need to build a really great marketplace. I think the combination of that really meant that, like, hey, we understand how to differentiate, how to drive a strategy and then how to do something well in the NFT space. Then going back to the other point, like, you have the team, but you still have to have a differential vision around what this thing is.
00:22:22.490 - 00:22:56.712, Speaker A: Right. When we saw nFts pick up, this was around q one last year. I think that's when people's having early Q two last year, you got this palpable sense this is crypto going mainstream. New York Times talking about a Vanity fair, talking about a celebrity is talking about it. Crypto. Twitter is just excitement and people that I know you're an l one guru, you can talk to people about l one sdhe. But the average non crypto guy, if you talk about all one, their eyes will glaze over.
00:22:56.712 - 00:23:21.020, Speaker A: But if you talk about nfts and culture, entertainment and games, they can relate. We just really felt that, hey, this is the thing where it goes mainstream. And if it goes mainstream, we come from consumer Internet, consumer product background. We thought we could do something different. It was really the combination of those two things that we thought, hey, we can do something pretty special in this space.
00:23:21.720 - 00:24:03.916, Speaker B: Yeah, that's brilliant. Yeah. The team drives, I mean, everything. And the ability to kind of see what was happening kind of bubbling up within the NFT space was phenomenal, I think. Yeah. Touching upon the culture aspect, I've been amazed and honestly surprised by how much culture or how NFTs have infiltrated culture so heavily with, I mean, many things, with art, with music, so many different aspects that it's starting now to get into. It's been extremely fun to watch.
00:24:03.916 - 00:24:27.196, Speaker B: Just kind of see it start to get into the mainstream, I think. But touching on that point, overall, there's not as many users today using blockchains or nfts as a whole. What do you think are, like, how do we bring in the next hundred million people into these crypto ecosystems?
00:24:27.388 - 00:25:23.058, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a tough one, right? I think, like, I think it's a couple of. A couple of different things. Like, I think number one is we should really move. Like, you're starting to see it, like, with guys like our team come into the space, which is like, more like product builders coming in here who can identify, like, key use cases, and build really polished experiences around them, if you ask us, like magic Eden team. Yeah, we have good, smart contract engineers, but we're not like the consensus algorithms guys. Like we don't know. Like we don't spend a lot of time debating that kind of stuff, but we do spend a lot of time and a lot of our mindshare thinking about how do we create what are really valuable pain points and problems to solve for the users, and how do we create really nice, polished, elevated experiences for them.
00:25:23.058 - 00:26:27.388, Speaker A: So we are those kind of guys. And I think like, as, like, you know, the infra layer becomes like more robust and so on and as like, you know, basically more primitives like nfts and sfts and all of these things get unlocked is going to enable, like more like product builders like us to come in and start building the use cases to draw it. And ultimately the way that people will come into the ecosystem will be, will be because of the use cases and the value that those use cases can deliver to them, rather than what was the previous generations, which is more like an ideological leap of faith into a new financial system. So I think that's got to be one macro overlay of this whole thing. I think a second micro overlay is it's still about trust, safety and reliability. Doesn't matter what tech stack that you build on, the users kind of still want like very fundamental, the same motivations. And there was a time when a lot of projects would be fully anon, like doing a lot of crazy stuff.
00:26:27.388 - 00:27:14.840, Speaker A: But now I kind of firmly believe that, hey, to really draw the next 100 million people in, we doxed. We are trying to represent our brand, we try to represent the values of our brand and we want to use that to create this sense of trust and reliability. When people come and engage with magic, Eden no longer play this niche role of being a niche crypto startup, but more being like, hey, we are super legit founders and we have a vision of serving our users super well and we will use that to create a sense of trust to onboard those users into the ecosystem. You know, like in some ways that's not the prevalent view still right in crypto companies today.
00:27:16.860 - 00:28:21.336, Speaker B: I think that's important as well. Like building the product that allows users to drive more value than the underlying technology itself. Like, I think that like that is the key thing, making it easier and building just legitimate products. And I think also going back to like the community aspect and like the culture, like, you've been able to tie and marry all those things together very well and I think that's what has allowed the Magic Eden team and your product to succeed so well. So it's cool just hearing you touch upon them all. So I think maybe just, I think it would perhaps be a little bit more interesting if you could just kind of touch upon, like, magic Eden, like, holistically and kind of some of your thoughts about, like, the platform and maybe, like, where you kind of see it going over, like, the next, like, couple months or what you're excited about.
00:28:21.528 - 00:28:52.954, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, imagine you didn't like, you know, we feel, like, super privileged to be where we are today, right? So today, wherever, 95% market share on Solana NFTs, we're second largest NFT marketplace in the world behind Opensea by, like, organic volume. And I think we're the fastest NFT marketplace in the world to reach a billion dollars in GMB. So we reached out in less than six months.
00:28:53.082 - 00:28:53.866, Speaker B: Congrats.
00:28:54.018 - 00:29:36.284, Speaker A: Since founding. But all of that, we take that with a real sense of, like, humility and, like, you know, it's very humbling to actually be where we are today. I think, like, we got to where we are today by doing a couple of things, like, number one, being really community driven. So we don't want to have, like, a transactional relationship with our users. We want to really have a two way dialogue with our users. And that's how we set up, like, really community driven initiatives like our magic Dao, right, where folks can in the community, they get rewarded by being a magic edent user, but they also can partake in platform decisions like what goes on out on page and stuff. So that's the first one.
00:29:36.284 - 00:30:40.070, Speaker A: And the second one is like, really being in the culture and really understanding what the current users want and iterating really fast. So example of that would be, I think two days ago we just asked Twitter, what features do you want to see on magic? Eat it. We got 100 replies in a couple of hours and we're just shipping those things and really making sure that we're listening to the community and doing what they really value. So that's kind of like two very underlying things that got us to where we are. And we want to make sure we continue over the next, not just months, but over the long term, have them as philosophical operating principles for us. At the same time, of course, we have our own hypotheses of where we think the world is going to go and we want to drive towards that long term roadmap as well. A couple of things that's really important to us would be number one is gaming.
00:30:40.070 - 00:31:28.450, Speaker A: We just launched Eden games three weeks ago and right now I think 92% of all gaming nfts on Solana trade on Magi Eden. And we see that as a testament of, hey, users are resonating with the value prop that we have in games. What we want to do there is if you think historically, the concept of a marketplace, the paradigm has always been, I go to the marketplace, I buy something and I take it home and then I open it up and I get to experience the benefit and value of it. That's what the marketplace does. But we want to turn that paradigm on its head, which is don't worry about buying anything. When you come to the marketplace, you should be able to get value regardless. You should feel inspired by your experience with nfTs.
00:31:28.450 - 00:32:02.418, Speaker A: And if you are so inspired and you then decide to buy something, yeah, that's cool. Here it is. You can try some stuff. And that's our philosophy with games. It's very immersive. We're like the first platform where you can go there, play the game, watch content about the game, and then if you like the stuff that you're seeing, you're like, oh, now I want to get a panzer dog tank or I want to get a gold viking or something arctic Viking from many nations, then you can do that. And we really want to flip that paradigm on its head.
00:32:02.418 - 00:32:10.394, Speaker A: So that's the principle we have in games. And over the next couple of months, we're going to be making a really big push and we're pretty excited about that.
00:32:10.562 - 00:32:43.366, Speaker B: That's awesome. I'm super excited about the gaming world. I think one of the interesting things going back to the web two culture versus web3 is some of the pushback that we've seen with gamers NFTs and kind of that tension between web two and web3. So, I mean, I think we're both fairly optimistic over the long term, people will kind of change their minds about that. But it's interesting to kind of see the different cultures at least clash at the moment.
00:32:43.518 - 00:33:38.078, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's very interesting. I think, like the two things, like it always starts with the people, like, you have to have real builders, high integrity builders, and trends don't happen by themselves. It's the people who make the trends. And what we're seeing now is absolutely the criticism and the pushback is justified in many, many respects. There were definitely very facetious behavior of crypto games and so on. But at the same time, we do see definitely a massive influx of legitimate, high integrity gaming developers who want to really do something and explore the boundaries of this NFT technology in a very wholesome and gamer accretive kind of way. So that's why we're very bullish on the other side to this is financializing.
00:33:38.078 - 00:34:30.816, Speaker A: I think a lot of gamers have a very justified sense of pushback towards crypto games because the game is not good, but it's just financialized. Right. But this thing about like, financializing a category that doesn't just happen in nfts and it doesn't just happen in games, it happens across. It's an issue prevalent in all of crypto. Even DeFi is the same. A lot of real bankers will be like, what is this DeFi thing? This defi seems like such a ponzi scheme, which is true a lot of the time, but at the same time, Defi gave birth to some really, really innovative stuff, like Aave compound maker, all these things, which really does look like the future building blocks of something much greater than what it is now. I think those kind of trends and those kind of observations apply across not just nfts and games, but to all of crypto.
00:34:30.816 - 00:34:40.380, Speaker A: And if you look at other categories in crypto, great things got borne out of them. And we all have to just be an optimist and take a leap of faith and believe in the people that's building this space now.
00:34:41.440 - 00:35:35.182, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I totally agree. It's interesting. I think it was christen who said the next generation things start out as toys, but over time mature into something much greater. I think that's totally the case with crypto as well. It's very interesting to see how they unfold. It's unique, touching upon gaming and nfts. Maybe could you also go a little bit deeper into your thoughts about just creators as a whole and what you kind of think maybe nfts playing a role, if any, within creators or the future of online creators?
00:35:35.366 - 00:36:32.800, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think, like, number one, like, I think NFT is a really exciting new primitive for creators, right? And I think, like, it's a new building block. And, you know, creators who are willing to explore the boundaries of it is really going to get a lot of value out of it as well. At the same time, like, from a magic Eden perspective, I kind of think, like, there's a lot of really fundamental motivations of creators that's true whether they are web one, web two, web3, or analog. Number one, they want to connect and build a community around their creations, on around their content. Number two, they want to be recognized and rewarded fairly for what they created. And number three, they want a way to engage with their fans.
00:36:32.800 - 00:37:45.868, Speaker A: And whether, like on any technology paradigm, I feel like creators have those core motivations that they've always wanted. And we as like a marketplace for NFTs ultimately are also thinking about this. We're thinking about, hey, when we engage with different creators, whether they're artists, collectible creators, gaming creators, how can we best serve them and understand their motivations along some of the things that I just talked about and build a product that can really serve them. So to that sense, that's why we created a product like Launchpad, where we are helping creators basically build their community and distribute their creation to that community and be rewarded very fairly for it. And we have some other products. Like, we have an advisory council that we're working on to help creators go through all this anxiety of working out what crypto is about and working on what NFT art is about and really helping in that way. And that's why we have Eden games, which shows off all the content and the gameplay of the game itself to help gaming creators distribute and make sure I grow awareness and grow community around their creations.
00:37:45.868 - 00:39:14.356, Speaker A: So in that sense, I feel like there's some very core similar themes and similar motivations across all creative groups that we, as a technology marketplace provider, we should be doing for them. The other thing I would say about, like, creators is that, like, going back to some of this, like, principle around, like, hey, we love like grassroots creators and so on and so on and so forth. Like, like, this comes from, you know, my experience in Google and seeing YouTube and stuff. It almost seems like with every new form of content, right? And I will put NFTs maybe as like, loosely defined as a new form of technology content, right? So there's a certain, like, group of folks who basically bet their careers on it and to explore like, the new business models that's created from this new form of content. If you think about YouTube, that's what happened. Like, when YouTube came along, there wasn't this concept of YouTube influencers or YouTube content creators, but then there were folks who, like, the phone bros and all of these kind of guys who then, like, went to LA and like, back then, like celebrities, you could only go through Hollywood, be on tv or be in a movie or something. But all of a sudden, like, YouTube, this new type of content platform gave rise to this new form of content creator who then, you know, monetized and built a business model and became even more famous than some, like, tv celebrities, right.
00:39:14.356 - 00:39:40.650, Speaker A: Or new celebrities. And I kind of feel like that will also play out in the NFT space. There'll be some folks who really bet on it and they'll really figure out what's the new business model in this new paradigm, and then they will become the fumbros of tomorrow in nfts. And we are also searching and we are also trying to pattern match to see if any of those creators will come about.
00:39:41.710 - 00:40:08.770, Speaker B: It totally makes sense. I think you hit the nail on the head. And it is interesting just to see how technology, the underlying platform, morphs and changes over time. Also the early adapters to those platforms and how they use the tools and the new primitives, as you said, to explore different boundaries and change what is possible. I'm very excited about what the future creators will create with nfts.
00:40:08.930 - 00:40:11.230, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.
00:40:12.890 - 00:40:52.260, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe, I think, I'm not sure how much time we have left, but maybe to kind of wrap it up. I think what would be interesting is for maybe some advice for founders or builders in the space in the crypto ecosystem. What advice would you kind of have to them for building a product or some of the things that you've learned along the way within Magic Eden and then maybe like a quick follow up with that? What would you advise to people that want to learn about nfts or get involved in the crypto or web3 community?
00:40:53.080 - 00:41:54.910, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for founders and folks in the ecosystem, to the first part of the question, I don't feel that qualified to give advice because we're also just trying, we're also trying to see what works and double down the things that work. I think the only thing that I would say is it's true for every startup, but definitely is extremely true for crypto, is timers of the essence. Just ship, execute fast. That's what magic unit has found to do really well for us because the environment is so volatile and it changes so fast and new trends arise and fall so fast. The only way that you can like constantly stay in front and like, is to move really fast as well, to basically match that. So in some ways it's pretty exhausting, but at the same time, it's extremely, extremely exciting. It's like exhilarating actually to do this.
00:41:54.910 - 00:42:40.104, Speaker A: So that's what I'll say to like to the builders of the space. I'm very excited to work with everyone to continue to build this ecosystem and to bring, to share more of this technology or share more of these technology enabled experiences with new users to the ecosystem. And then on the other side, which is what you were saying, what do we say to the new users, to the new visitors of the ecosystem? I think, first of all, we say welcome. Welcome to taking a red pill to jump in. I think it's amazing. Everyone in crypto at some point was exactly where you were, right. We all had to get over a whole bunch of, like, skepticism, anxiety.
00:42:40.104 - 00:42:56.728, Speaker A: But once you were in, like, I almost. I definitely feel like there's no going back. Right. It really is a red pill moment where you, like, cross the chasm across the Rubicon. So, first of all, we say welcome. And second of all, we say, like, we empathize. You know, we were at one point exactly where you were.
00:42:56.728 - 00:43:43.200, Speaker A: And in some sense, like, as folks who are, like, in this ecosystem and who are crypto native, like us, then, like, let us know how we can help. We are always here to help, to onboard, to share some of the lessons that we've had and to give comfort and give assurance that this is going to be amazing. That's what, in that sense, magic Eden, you'll find we are one of the most open and welcoming companies ever. Extremely flat, extremely egalitarian. DM's always open. So anytime you want to connect with us or any times that you want to share feedback about how we can serve the users better, please let us know, and we'll be glad to partner. We'll be glad to help.
00:43:43.620 - 00:43:58.560, Speaker B: Wonderful. I think that's excellent. Perfect. Well, yeah. Thank you again, Jack. It was truly a pleasure, and I appreciate your time to prick your bane and see what everything you've been up to at the magic Eden side.
00:43:58.900 - 00:44:01.180, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks a ton, Logan. Yeah, it's been a true pleasure.
