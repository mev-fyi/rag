00:00:00.160 - 00:00:45.130, Speaker A: Massari was just starting the research team, and I had opportunity to join and be one of the first researchers there. Within six months of me joining, we had Covid. And then Covid was probably the biggest accelerant for this asset class, at least that I'd ever seen at the time. So I always wanted to do a fund in this industry. I didn't think I'd get the opportunity to do it as early as I did. For us, I think the biggest opportunity was that there really weren't that many public markets focused funds, and then two. I think we'd reached a stage in the crypto economy where you were seeing the very early signs of secular winners emerging in different categories.
00:00:45.130 - 00:01:11.470, Speaker A: So we started the fund in May 2022 with about 65 million. And for the first six months, we actually just did not deploy any capital. We just did research. And five days after we launched, Terra collapsed. And then six weeks after we launched, we had three ac collapse. And I think at that point, it made it very easy to just be like, all right, well, this market is completely uninvestable. Let's just be patient.
00:01:11.470 - 00:01:32.230, Speaker A: And then I think the trigger for us to start deploying was right after FTX collapsed. And at that point, we started to see, like, truly distressed valuations across the board. And that wasn't a signal for us to, like, go all in, but it was a signal for us to start slowly nibbling across the board.
00:01:33.610 - 00:02:07.490, Speaker B: Ryan, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. I was. We originally got connected and kind of started nerding out on some of the infrastructure stuff. But even prior to that, I was a big fan of your work at Masari and the research reports that you put out there. So appreciate you educating this space and really pushing it forward, because I think that level of discourse is kind of rare, especially on crypto Twitter. And well thought out pieces are very much appreciated.
00:02:08.030 - 00:02:12.958, Speaker A: Yeah, appreciate it. And happy we could finally do this. I know we've been talking about this for quite a bit of time.
00:02:13.054 - 00:02:29.350, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think what would be interesting for either some of the people that don't know you or just coming up to speed, is a little bit about your background, how you ultimately started a fund, your work at Masari, and kind of just like, painting, painting that picture for everybody.
00:02:29.650 - 00:03:04.748, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So I first discovered bitcoin in 2014 when I was in high school. One of my friends was using the Silk Road, and that's how it was introducing me use case didn't really interest me at the time, I wouldn't say I was the most intellectually curious person at that time either. So I just pushed it aside and would read news articles about it from here and there, but at the time, wasn't recovered well. So if you read an article about bitcoin in 2014, chances are it's about something criminal, so no reason to get in. Fast forward to college.
00:03:04.748 - 00:03:41.878, Speaker A: I'm a sophomore in 2016, and I'm trying to get into investment banking, and someone I knew on campus was starting a cryptocurrency club, and they were an intern at Coindesk, and they had two free tickets to go to consensus. So I thought, okay, yeah, you know what? Let me go to this conference. I hear all these banks talking about blockchain technology. So I went. Now, it was the peak of the enterprise blockchain hype. So naturally, the big speakers and sponsors were people like IBM, Microsoft, Deloitte. And there really wasn't much discussion about any of the cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum.
00:03:41.878 - 00:04:37.354, Speaker A: So once again, just kind of left that conference being like, all right, this is, I guess, cool, but it's an enterprise database technology. Nothing I really need to worry about. But it was still worthwhile to go to a conference because I did use some of the knowledge I got there to get that internship in investment banking and demonstrating that I knew some frontier technology. And then fast forward 2017, I'm interning in investment banking, and I see a headline on my desk in the summer saying, ethereum is up 2005% year to date. And I'm like, what the hell is ethereum? Cause I thought all this stuff was used for criminals. So I put a little bit of money in, didn't actually know what I was investing at the time, and just started to actually learn. And the first thing I did is I took a step back and realized that, oh, wait, I actually don't understand what money is.
00:04:37.354 - 00:05:15.640, Speaker A: And it makes sense why I didn't understand what money was, because money, for me has always worked. So you grew up in the United States. You have a stable monetary system. You don't have to think about the value of money or the purpose of it or how money came into existence. It's kind of just like water, and you're a fish, right? You don't think about it. So I spent some time understanding what money was, and then the second thing to help me understand bitcoin was learning about the concept of decentralization. I think there were many people at the time that were telling me what decentralization was and why it mattered from an ideological perspective.
00:05:15.640 - 00:05:58.988, Speaker A: But that didn't really resonate with me, because the reason why we build technology is not to push some ideology, it's to make the world better. So I started to ask, what is the purpose of decentralization? I eventually got to nanter and I put two and two together. A money and decentralization. I was like, all right, you know what? This bitcoin thing makes a little bit of sense, but I'm still not fully sold. So I started to look into ethereum, and that's actually what really opened my eyes, because that's when I started to understand blockchains as a general purpose technology that we can use to not only reimagine our monetary institutions, but also our financial institutions. And I maybe many, many more. So that's why I knew I wanted to get in.
00:05:58.988 - 00:06:08.916, Speaker A: But when I had this revelation, it was probably spring 2018, and as you remember, everything was crashing. There were no funds hiring. There were no research firms that existed.
00:06:08.988 - 00:06:25.200, Speaker B: It was brutal by market. I mean, yeah, I got in probably similar time to you, tail end of 2017, and remember thinking I was a genius for a couple weeks and then quickly being humbled, and that bear market drew out for quite some time.
00:06:25.820 - 00:07:04.908, Speaker A: It did. But for some reason, I was just hooked. I was just hooked. And even though I still went on to start my career in investment banking, the entire time, I was just fascinated by this crypto stuff. And I'd be constantly going to meetups or leaving work when I can and doing some reach on the side. Eventually, in 2019, when we had a bit of a spring, like crypto spring, and bitcoin got up to 1314k, some firms started to hire. And Masari was just starting a research team, and I had an opportunity to join and be one of the first researchers there, it ended up being perfect timing, because within six months of me joining, we had Covid.
00:07:04.908 - 00:08:08.246, Speaker A: And then Covid was probably the biggest accelerant for this asset class, at least that I'd ever seen at the time. And very quickly, not only did prices start to go up, but we also started to see the emergence of use cases beyond bitcoin. That actually violated everything that was being built beyond bitcoin. And that was a really good time, I think, to be a researcher, to just be heads down in spending all your waking hours just learning and reading and writing about everything that was going on in this industry. And it was good. So, yeah, that was, I think, an incredible time to be a researcher. And I think another thing that underrated point about that time is that was also the first time when you started to see a handful of data platforms start to come out, and you can actually start to do some very rudimentary on chain analysis to start to understand how are these on chain economies evolving? Like, how are people using them.
00:08:08.246 - 00:08:32.556, Speaker A: So some key insights that I got during that time were, okay, you know what I. Stablecoins seem to be this big thing. Stable coins are being used to transact on ethereum more than eth itself. I remember discovering that in 2020, and that was a big thing. And that was also something really special at that time as well. It's the first time we could actually look at some data about, okay, these things are being used. They're no longer just theories and white papers.
00:08:32.556 - 00:08:34.052, Speaker A: There's actually some products.
00:08:34.236 - 00:09:24.892, Speaker B: Yeah, it's often funny looking back, just how things align and one thing leads to another. So ultimately got the opportunity to join Masari on the early days, joining as one of the early researchers. You publish a lot of great articles, and I think one was 33 pages or thereabouts on Ethereum, and kind of the Ethereum future roadmap was excellent. Tell us a little bit more about, like, what was the transition like? So going deep in Covid, spending all your waking hours understanding kind of the metrics, looking at doing deep fundamental analysis, but then you jumped from doing that to, I want to do a fund. How was that transition?
00:09:25.076 - 00:10:14.120, Speaker A: Yeah, so I always wanted to do a fund in this industry. I didn't think I'd get the opportunity to do it as early as I did. I. But I think what changed at the time was started to get some early interest from different people in my network by starting a fund and thought that, okay, maybe I could raise a small fund from people. But I didn't have a concrete idea of what actually I wanted to build and how that'd be different than what's already out there. So I took some time in 2021, and I was talking to a bunch of different funds, partially recruiting, partially also just kind of gathering notes on what is the market and whatever exists. And when I got to the end of 2021, I think I fully fleshed out our thesis.
00:10:14.120 - 00:11:19.106, Speaker A: And for us, I think the biggest opportunity was that there really weren't that many public markets focused funds. And then two, I think we'd reached a stage in the crypto economy where you were seeing the very early signs of secular winners emerging in different categories. So for us, we thought there was a massive opportunity and there was this massive white space to create, like, a long biased hedge fund that was taking, contrary to bets on the secular winners of the crypto economy. So that's a thesis we went out with and raised at the end of 2021. And it was an interesting time to raise because obviously capital was flowing very, very freely. So it was a really good time to raise, but it was a terrible time to deploy. So what we tell our lp's as we are raising is that like, listen, here is this thesis that we have, this is not going to play out anytime soon.
00:11:19.106 - 00:12:07.868, Speaker A: In fact, we're actually bearish here. We sold everything in our pas, and there's actually a chance that when we get this capital, we're actually not going to deploy it for the first 612 months. And that's fine, because when we do deploy, we will have the opportunity to buy many of these assets that we all love right now in 2021, and think we're going to go even higher. Solana's at 250 the time, bitcoin's at 60, 60, whatever k, you'll be able to buy all these assets down 80%, 90% from all time highs if we're right. So that's what we did. We started the fund in May 2022 with about 65 million. And for the first six months, we actually just did not deploy any capital.
00:12:07.868 - 00:12:44.250, Speaker A: We just did research, and five days after we launched, terra collapsed. And then six weeks after we launched, we had three ac collapse. I think at that point, it made it very easy to just be like, all right, well, this market is completely uninvestable. Let's just be patient. And then I think the trigger for us to start deploying was right after FTX collapsed. And at that point, we started to see truly distressed valuations across the board. And that wasn't a signal for us to, like, go all in, but it was a signal for us to start slowly nibbling across the board.
00:12:44.250 - 00:13:00.690, Speaker A: And that's what we did. So that was kind of the story of the launch of the fund, and I guess how we navigated the first, I guess, six to twelve months of the bear market. And the thesis we had and kind of why we started it, that's pretty goaded.
00:13:02.550 - 00:13:56.530, Speaker B: Being able to raise capital in a time that capital was abundant, being able to have the insights to say, hey, if we do a liquid fund, there is dispersion starting to emerge as the asset class starts to merge or mature, and then acknowledging that, hey, we can raise a fund, which is probably one of the best times in history to raise a fund. Don't do anything. And the confluence of events with Luna with three AC, and then ultimately FTX starting to deploy post that was pretty much pico bottom. So it is rather remarkable, and kudos to you guys for the discipline and the foresight to see all this, because that is not easy.
00:13:57.440 - 00:14:33.274, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, to be fair, it's not like we made concrete predictions that terror is going to collapse and three ac is going to collapse, and Sam's a fraud. But we had a view that things were likely to get worse. And usually when we're in a, I think, unwinding environment or in an unwinding market like that, you get some blow ups. So I guess it was within the realms of expectations that you would have some banks blowing up in the industry, some protocols collapsing. But the specifics are always different, right?
00:14:33.322 - 00:15:19.760, Speaker B: Yeah, well, remarkable nonetheless. Maybe. So, ultimately, you guys spun up the fund, raised capital, waited to deploy, and then started deploying a little bit post Ft. Post FTX. What was the thought process a little bit more on that research side that you did? Because I think our first conversation that we had was really around the emergence of high throughput blockchain, Solana specifically, and nerding out on the research about that side. What was the research period leading up to starting to deploy more capital and ultimately getting you excited about the high conviction bets that you guys have made thus far?
00:15:21.040 - 00:16:32.096, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I'll start with the Solana bet, because that I think that the conversation we had was very important, and I think that the beauty of that 2022 and then especially 2023 period after we had the big blowups already and everything was quiet, is that there's a lot of time to do research. There's also a lot of space to do it as well. So Twitter was very quiet. There wasn't a lot of activity happening in the industry. So you had a lot of, and also a lot of people, I think, capitulated intellectually on many different use cases for the industry as well. So it created a lot of space to think and think independently and a lot of time to do research. So one of the, I think that what sparked, I guess, the idea of we should do research on all these Fresnel ones, and it wasn't even just Solana at first, was that there is this kind of fractal that I was playing with my head of there's going to be another Ethereum like opportunity in this bear market where it's down, like 95% and it's going to rise from the ashes.
00:16:32.096 - 00:17:01.758, Speaker A: And I don't know which one it could be, but my gut tells me it's probably the one of the high flyers from last cycle. Right? So Solana avalanche. There was like a handful that were kind of fitting that category. And we actually spent two months. And also maybe to kind of jump back a little bit. I'd been very skeptical about Solana for the longest time. And the reason why was that I thought that one.
00:17:01.758 - 00:17:44.600, Speaker A: I thought that the community was very manufactured. It didn't feel as grassroots and organic as Ethereum. And usually when you don't have that grassroots development, you don't get as much innovation where you get a lot of copycats. And to be fair, in 2021, a lot of the leading projects on Solana were copycats. It was just people copying uniswap and putting on Solana, or copying Aave and putting on Solana. So that was one. And then the second reason why was that I wasn't convinced that there was a path to Solana being decentralized.
00:17:44.600 - 00:18:22.590, Speaker A: And why did that matter? The ideology of decentralization doesn't matter, but there are practical benefits of decentralization. If your system is more resilient to attacks, then that means that it's more reliable, and from the reliable, people want to build on it. Right, as an example of this. And I wasn't convinced that the reason why Solana was more scalable, so to say, was because of some kind of innovation. I thought that maybe it was just because they were jacked up, the hardware required. That was actually what the common view was at the time. It's like, oh, yeah, well, Solana is more scalable because it's just running on one single server.
00:18:22.590 - 00:19:21.470, Speaker A: And that's not really how it works. And I remember we had a conversation, and I think more so than any of the specifics of what we talked about, although the one thing that was very apparent was the massive gap in throughput that Solana offered versus Ethereum, not just in its current state, but post EIP 444 and even post stank sharding. That was, I think, very apparently like, oh, wow, like, you know what? There's actually a big performance gap that is going to make a difference over the next two to three years or even longer term. But beyond that, it was actually just seeing how much conviction a handful of people who were deeply involved in a community had. And that felt rare, because you don't typically see that with projects in this industry, builders, investors who've been there and are doubling down. And I'm committing, I'm betting my career on this. Like, that's a very strong signal.
00:19:23.250 - 00:19:23.538, Speaker B: So.
00:19:23.554 - 00:19:57.076, Speaker A: I think what actually got us over to Lana Solana was we just took the time to really dig into his technical architecture and actually substantiate that claim that Solana has structurally higher throughput than Ethereum. And how do we figure this out? Well, I guess what we realized when we ran the numbers quantitatively was that per $1 invested in hardware to run a validator, or full node, you got one to two orders of magnitude more throughput. And that's quite standardized.
00:19:57.188 - 00:19:58.680, Speaker B: It's pretty remarkable as well.
00:19:59.740 - 00:20:49.466, Speaker A: And that was a big aha moment for me. It's like, all right, were you telling me that you can run a Solana node, maybe at home, maybe in data center, for like $3,500 a year, which is not totally out of realm of possibility for most people. And you're telling me that this extra cost, because I think it was six x more expensive, maybe seven x more expensive to run that than Ethereum node, you're actually getting one to two orders of magnitude more throughput. That seems like a good bet to me. Once again, that's not even talking about any design decision. It's like, here are the numbers, make of that what you will. And then the second thing that I realized is that the entire conversation around full nodes, I think was wrong.
00:20:49.466 - 00:22:12.686, Speaker A: Where if you looked at the data, even in 2023, at the time that we were writing our investment memo, Solana already had 40% the amount of full nodes as Ethereum, which was a little bit shocking, because once again, the narrative is that all these full nodes are just running in a couple of data centers, but in reality, you're already within striking distance. And then two, the way of thinking about what drives the growth of full nodes, I think, was also a little bit incorrect at the time for me, where what drives the growth of full node count isn't necessarily the cost. It's great if it's cheaper to run, that does enable more people run a full node. But what drives the full node count is actually demand to run full nodes. And what does that come from? That comes from adoption. If you have a blockchain that is doing millions of transactions every single day, and there's a ton of users and a ton of activity, well, that's now an incentive for exchange to run a full node, for a wallet to run a full node, and all these different sophisticated actors run full nodes because they need it to run their business. So that's how you actually can get to a point where you're going from 1000 to 10,000 to 10,0000 full nodes has nothing to do with the cost, has everything to do with demand.
00:22:12.686 - 00:22:25.432, Speaker A: And demand side is what people, I think, miss with so much of this stuff because they're always focused on the supply side of, oh, we just make it cheap, we need to make it decentralized. How about let's just get users?
00:22:25.576 - 00:23:22.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I went through that same exercise as well. And to your point, the conversation was really framed around was a single database. It wasn't decentralized. And you start peeling that back and you're just like, these claims are just wrong. They're just wrong. I think that is what ultimately allowed both of us to gain that conviction after really looking at the fundamentals of what this thing could become. And it's kind of a little surreal to me just starting to see it play out, because I still think we're really at the precipice of what Solana and these high throughput blockchains can ultimately do because of the amount of scale that they'll ultimately unlock and giving the blockchain properties of decentralization permissionless, the coordination.
00:23:22.070 - 00:23:48.940, Speaker B: It is fascinating. And to me now, what gets me excited is that the infrastructure is finally there to enable applications that actually scale. To me, the big unlock is having application engineers focus on applications and not infrastructure. Which was always the thing that pissed me off about Ethereum was that engineers would be removing certain lines of code because gas was too expensive.
00:23:49.320 - 00:24:56.960, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I totally agree. And that's also where I started to appreciate more the differences in design philosophy around integrated versus modular. And where it clicked is that not only is there this big throughput advantageous, which makes it likely that Solana will continue to gain a larger share of activity versus the rest of the industry over the next three to five years, but there is also this simplicity around building on an integrated system where you don't have to think about all these lower level infrastructure problems, of what roll up do I build on and what interoperability protocol do I use? All this stuff that you just don't need to think about. But yeah, I think at the time it was still just theory, though, with Solana. Cool. Maybe you have all this throughput, and maybe you do have some builders that are here and they're committed, but no one's really using it. In the beginning of or middle of 2023, the usage was still very low.
00:24:56.960 - 00:25:28.650, Speaker A: So you're really making a bet purely based on the strength of the, the community and the community, I mean, like builders, investors, businesses that are in the Solana community, and then the actual technology. That really was what the bet was at that time. And I don't think anyone thought that we would see this quick of an inflection in activity, where now it's starting to rival Ethereum across many of these metrics, and surpassing it and surpassing it in many ways.
00:25:29.530 - 00:26:07.358, Speaker B: It is remarkable. It's funny because back in the day it was like, oh, Solana was just the NFT chain. When Ethereum was expensive for nfts, they were just like, it's the poor people's NFT chain. And then there's so much fud. Then it was the 75 Dax or the devs, the SPF chain, and on and on. I think it's now becoming harder and harder, going back to the fundamentals and the metrics. It's starting to surpass it on things like Mev revenue, I mean, transactions, it's been doing for a while.
00:26:07.358 - 00:26:33.510, Speaker B: But as these metrics become more and more apparent, I think you're going to just see more and more capitulation, where it's like, all right, this is the platform that is allowing people to just build apps. It's doing something simple and dumb, which is the smart contract platform, and trying to abstract that away from everybody else engineers to actually focus on building apps, which I think we're both really excited for as kind of the next frontier.
00:26:34.810 - 00:27:26.690, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think for one, this is almost like a. I guess since 2018, I've seen the emergence of probably like four mega trends in this industry. The first one was stablecoins, the second one was Defi and Ethereum, which I think validated the whole smart contract platform thesis. And then now I think there's the emergence of these two new mega trends, one of which is Solana and the application being built on top of it, and a fourth one, I guess we can later in the podcast. And what's interesting is that I think in each case where we had the emergence is megatrendous. There was a very notable inflection point that to me signified that the trend was real.
00:27:26.690 - 00:28:19.540, Speaker A: And for stablecoins, that was when stablecoins on Ethereum surpassed ETH in transaction volumes. What did that tell us? It told us that people were using stablecoins more than Ethereum on this platform. Why was that the case? At the time? It was to move stablecoins in between exchanges. There was some early DeFi usage, some early emerging markets usage, but that was really it. Once we got to that point, I think it became very clear to me that, ok, we actually need to rethink how we were thinking about the on chain economy. It's no longer just going to be this place where we're just sending ETH back and forth or whatever. They're now like dollars on blockchains.
00:28:19.540 - 00:28:42.698, Speaker A: And that was huge because I think that happened somewhere between middle 2019 and early 2020 was when stablecoin started to sustainably surpass Ethereum and transaction volumes on its platform. And after that, the rest is history. The stablecoin supply is 170 billion. It's grown at a 225% CAGR.
00:28:42.834 - 00:28:52.882, Speaker B: I feel like today, if you're bullish crypto as an asset class, you have to be bullish like crypto stablecoins, or just stable coins getting to the trillions.
00:28:52.986 - 00:28:53.790, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:28:55.130 - 00:29:22.430, Speaker B: It seems inevitable that this trend is going to continue as the traditional economy becomes more financialized through blockchain rails. I'm very bullish stablecoins, and it's just been remarkable. Even. I think we're filming today in the beginning of August of 2024, tether put out their quarterly report showing like 5 billion in a quarter, which is just ridiculous.
00:29:22.550 - 00:29:54.300, Speaker A: Yeah. And they're one of the largest holders of treasuries in the world. Crazy. Very clear, mega trend. And like I said, I think there was an inflection point where if you saw it, you would know, okay, this is the category I need to be betting on. Same thing with defi defi. Around a similar time, I think in middle of 2020, there was this inflection point where transaction volumes on ethereum, inclusive of stablecoins and ETH, surpassed transaction volumes on bitcoin.
00:29:54.300 - 00:30:39.238, Speaker A: That happened in Q one Q 220 20. And what did that tell me? I guess that tells me that, well, we have this on chain economy that is growing on Ethereum. In fact, it's growing so fast and it's become so large that it's surpassing bitcoin, which up until that point was seen as like the only use case for this technology. It's like we're just going to store value in it. And Ethereum was this digital casino that was used for icos, which all just went bust. That was the narrative for Ethereum at the time. After that inflection point, we saw, obviously the greatest bull market for Ethereum ever.
00:30:39.238 - 00:31:09.052, Speaker A: But we also saw Defi really take off. You saw on chain Dex volumes go through the roof. You saw assets that are stored in smart contracts. I guess we call it a total value locked. But the way that I interpret total value locked is what's significant about it is that these are assets that users are entrusting. The smart contracts to store, and that is a vote of confidence. If you're willing to store your own wealth in a smart contract, that probably means you think it's secure.
00:31:09.052 - 00:31:56.598, Speaker A: So I think it is notable in that sense. And TVL really started to go higher from there. And then I think we're at a similar point where Solana, where. Okay, let's say that you just wrote off Solana at some point in 2023, because the metrics weren't there, and it was still somewhat theoretical that it could get more activity or equal amount of activity in Ethereum. Well, today we're now at an inflection point where, depending on what metric you want to use, we actually are starting to rival or surpass Ethereum in that metric. The most important for me, I think, is, is the new economic value metric that blockworks put together, which is basically just adding transaction fees and mev revenue.
00:31:56.694 - 00:32:00.494, Speaker B: Their dashboards that they've been putting out are amazing. They've been killing it.
00:32:00.582 - 00:32:18.016, Speaker A: Really good, I think, very well curated, very well presented. That metric, I think, is the most important, because that is really. You can't game that metric. People are paying to use the chain, and they're paying an equal amount, if not more to Slana, than Ethereum. I don't know what you want to argue at that point. It's clear demand for the block space.
00:32:18.088 - 00:32:41.780, Speaker B: Right now that the FUD is wash trading. But at the end of the day, people are still paying to transact on a network that is ultimately recruiting value back to the network. And I think with these meme coins, it is interesting whether people are trying to fake volume. Some of it may be true, some of it may be not true, but at the end of the day, they're still paying to use the network.
00:32:42.230 - 00:33:22.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I have a couple points on this, the whole wash rating and meme coin point. The first is that it's almost like people forgot what DeFi Summer was. Defi Summer wasn't some utopian world where we're banking the unbank on chain. It was a bunch of people degenerately farming and speculating on DeFi assets. That's what it was. And I remember, actually, the argument that bitcoiners would make about what's happening, ethereum, is that it's a casino and no one actually is using any of this. This is all just purely speculation.
00:33:22.220 - 00:33:58.460, Speaker A: Fast forward to today. It's the same story, but different chain. Now, everyone's skeptical of all this activity in Solana because they're like, oh, wow, it's just meme coins and it's wash trading. I mean, by the way, the presence of bots on chain is not a bad thing. Most of financial markets are actually run by machines, as it is already. I think it's a sign of maturation that there are bots on chain. And regardless, I still think that the signal should be not that, okay, there's this meme co activity, speculative.
00:33:58.460 - 00:34:42.910, Speaker A: It's that the activity is taking place here. And why is that the case? Well, it's taking place here because it actually provides the throughput, the latency for trading to thrive. Otherwise it would be happening somewhere else. As simple as it is, there are some interesting stats that I always like to point out with the whole meme coin trend is pump fund. Whether you like it or not, it's the fastest growing application to crypto economy by revenue. So if you look at the time it took to get to $50 million in revenue, it is the fastest by far, right? And I'm sure it'll be the fastest to get to 100 million. We're probably maybe like two weeks away from that happening.
00:34:42.910 - 00:35:43.576, Speaker A: Why does that matter? Because when new developers see that you can build an application and generate $50 million in revenue in six months, potentially $100 million in eight months, that is a massive signal to come build here. And that just doesn't happen if you don't have any activity happening on your ecosystem. So I think that's really notable as well. As far as the activity, the other thing is also, it's a distraction, right? People will fill block space with whatever is, in a way, to think about it is transaction fees are just the marginal clearing price of demand for block space. And some of this more speculative casino like stuff will eventually just get priced out over time as more sustainable use cases come in. And I think that's what people miss when they're just looking at the meme coin stuff right now and not looking at some of the other things that are happening underneath the hood on Solana.
00:35:43.728 - 00:36:32.874, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just to echo your point on defi summer, it was funny because it was like hopping from one food token to another food token to yams. I it was a crazy time, but that was the experimentation, the excitement that really got people to say, what is this ethereum thing again? Builders were grinding throughout 2018, 2019 and 2020 to have some magic spark, and that was the lightning that made everybody be attracted to Ethereum. To me, it's just really exciting to see use cases continuing to evolve. And I think whether it's speculative, not. I was just talking with Shayan. And he was like, where attention goes, dollars go.
00:36:33.002 - 00:36:33.498, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:36:33.554 - 00:36:49.986, Speaker B: And the fact that the attention today is on Solana, just because it makes it a little bit more frictionless, it makes it easier to do that experience is what's attracting builders to build there, which I think is just exciting long term, 100%.
00:36:50.058 - 00:37:28.758, Speaker A: And I think that one of the. And the reason why meme coins and meme point launchpads are deciding to launch in Solana, in many ways, is the same reason why Deepin protocols decided to launch on Solana or migrate to Solana over the course of the bear market. Helium render are like the great examples. Helium for a long time was running its own blockchain. At a certain point, just realized that, yo, this blockchain stuff is hard. We don't need to do this ourselves, but we do need is, we need high throughput, we need low latency. And at the time, Solana was really the only option that provided the level of performance that it needed.
00:37:28.758 - 00:38:31.820, Speaker A: And where are we today? Well, could you build helium on a roll up on Ethereum? Yeah, you probably can, but why do you. But at the time that it migrated, was that possible? I think no. And then two, what is the roadmap to scale throughput from here? Which is more important when you decide what platform to build on with Solana, it's very straightforward of, we're going to scale linearly through hardware, and that's the floor, I think, of what it will scale at over the next ten years. Over the next ten years, Solana will scale 32 x, likely just purely based on, like, hardware improving. And then you get some software level innovations as well, which is like fire dancer and all that other stuff. And that's why those products are continuing to build here. And very similar to the comment you made earlier, I guess, from Shimshaeon, where it's like, dollars follow attention.
00:38:31.820 - 00:39:16.830, Speaker A: Well, very similar here. If the leading deep ins are merging on Solana and they're starting to generate meaningful revenue and meaningful traction. I think helium is like this almost like trailblazing project in the industry, where it is contracting with large telecoms for its business and has well over 100,000 paying mobile subscribers. That's a very high signal to other deep end protocols that this is where you want to build. Let's be honest. What informs the reason why people build in certain places? Sometimes it is a very in depth analysis on, oh, it provides this level of throughput and all that, but sometimes it's like your friend as a developer is building here and he's been successful.
00:39:17.730 - 00:39:18.202, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:18.266 - 00:39:18.930, Speaker A: All right.
00:39:19.090 - 00:40:03.450, Speaker B: I definitely agree. I'm excited that products don't have to focus on infrastructure as much. They can focus on trying to find product market fit that is hard enough. You shouldn't be trying to optimize certain level of removing lines of code just because the infrastructure does not support your product at scale. And I think maybe that's a good segue into how we think the industry is going to evolve now that we have a certain level of throughput. You're starting to see applications merge deep in whether pumped up funds of the world that are starting to produce these cash flows at a real scale. I think that conversation has started to kick off.
00:40:03.450 - 00:40:22.030, Speaker B: Should there be more fundamental investors as these, as the asset class continues to mature and these things start to produce meaningful revenues? What are your thoughts around this entire debate and these projects actually producing quite a bit of cash flow?
00:40:22.370 - 00:41:51.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's exciting. I think when I first got into this industry on a very decided on a retail basis in 2017, if you'd asked me where would we be in 2024, I probably thought we'd be a little bit further along and we'd have a bunch of applications that are starting to thrive, and that's just not quite where we are yet. But now that's within line of sight because we're no longer dealing with these thorny infrastructure problems all day. This is also what got us excited at a fun level when we were first spinning up the fun, and at the end of 2021, early 2022, is we had this thesis that there were in select categories winners starting to emerge. And this was a sign of maturation of the technology, that this technology was no longer about going from zero to one, but now one to 100. And there are probably some, it's probably a ton of money to be made by backing these winners at one and going to 100. But then what also may have signaled is that if winners are emerging, especially lower in the stack, that probably means the frontier is now not lower in the stack, but higher in the stack.
00:41:51.050 - 00:42:59.318, Speaker A: And to put some numbers on this, recently, as this sentiment, like negative sentiment, has emerged around venture backed assets and low flow, high fdv is the meme. We started to put together some data on infrastructure versus applications and who's generating more in revenue. Not fees, but revenue. Revenue is actually accruing to the protocol and the tokenization. And if the top 25 projects in the crypto economy, 19 of those are applications and not infrastructure, which I think is a bit of a narrative violation, right? That there are no applications that are here and that we just had too much. And then, yeah, that there are no good applications that are here. And then I think what that also is starting to show us is that the infrastructure, that the winners are generating a good amount of fees, like Ethereum, Solana, for example, deluxe, binary, smart chain, those are the three big ones that are generating the most fees of any infrastructure.
00:42:59.318 - 00:44:24.754, Speaker A: But then there's this massive long tail that just don't really make any money and there's no activity there. I don't think that's likely to change anytime soon, because quite frankly, we just don't need more of this infrastructure. And in contrast, there are applications on these winning platforms like Ethereum and Solana that are starting to really hit their stride and generating in some cases like nine figures in revenue and growing high double digits, not triple digit percentages year over year, and trading at S and P 500 multiples. I mean, it's nuts. So I think this is actually the time when you're going to start to see more fundamental investors come into the asset class, and those strategies start to thrive over the next three to five years as these applications and infrastructure, like the leaders in those categories, really start to go up the vertical part of the s curve. I think that's the most exciting trend that we're seeing, is that you're no longer investing in vaporware, hoping that a narrative catches on. Great, if a narrative catches on, but at least you have some fundamental value that over time should slowly cause price go up.
00:44:24.842 - 00:45:45.770, Speaker B: I think that is a narrative violation because you are actually starting to see people that are voting with their dollars saying, hey, this application is actually giving me enough value that I will pay for it, which is actually extremely bullish. I think it's going to be interesting to me because over the next, whether it's six months, twelve months, five years, you're going to have venture markets, in my mind, reset a little bit going back to, hey, if liquid people are, if liquid funds are starting to enter the space and be more disciplined on set of is this a narrative? What are the actual fundamentals that will also trickle back to venture investors and saying, show me how much you are actually producing in revenue to get to that next step of funding. I think what has happened today is we needed all this speculation, we needed a little bit more narrative based, but it is going to return to fundamentals. And I think the smart investors are now noticing that a little bit sooner. But I think it's welcome because that unlocks the institutional capital. Everybody talks, the institutions, the institutions this unlocks the institutions that actually say, hey, this is making money.
00:45:46.710 - 00:46:36.142, Speaker A: Totally agree. Totally agree. And I think it's also just important for the asset class, reputationally as well, to move beyond this period where everyone is just punting narratives all the time and nothing of substance is being created. Because when you talk to anyone that is not in this industry about this industry, I mean, in many cases, they just haven't even been paying attention. And they'll be surprised when you tell them that bitcoin's at all time highs. And if you start to talk about any use cases beyond bitcoin, if they're aware of them, they're like, all right, well, this is all vaporware. And if they're not aware of them, they're surprised when you tell them some of the statistics on these assets.
00:46:36.142 - 00:47:21.664, Speaker A: We mentioned the stablecoin point about how there's $170 billion of stablecoins in circulation on a quarterly basis. They're transacting trillions of dollars in volumes. And how you have big enterprises like PayPal that has launched its own stablecoin on Solana, and how you have stripe that now has integrated stablecoin payments. These are, I think, very big developments that people just haven't quite been paying attention to and have not yet entered the mainstream consciousness. And it's not just limited to stablecoins. It's also including, I think, Defi protocols. When you tell people that, all right, well, there's this project called maker, and it's generating $300 million in revenue annually.
00:47:21.664 - 00:48:01.754, Speaker A: It has grown well over, I think it was like 500% year over year, and it trades at like 19 times earnings, which is around the s and p multiple. Like, wow, that's incredible. I can't believe this. Deepen another good example. Helium is the one, I mean, obviously, we talked about it earlier. When you tell people that there is now this infrastructure provider that can help the big wireless carriers build out 5g capacity in these high density areas, and it's actually cheaper for them to do it, and they get better coverage. That's also a big unlock.
00:48:01.754 - 00:48:58.136, Speaker A: And by the way, it's not that this is a theory about what is possible with this technology. This is already happening. There's, like thousands of hotspots deployed all over the country. There's already a mobile carrier that helium incubated itself, helium mobile, that is using this infrastructure and has over 100,000 paying subscribers, and they're already testing offloading with some larger carriers. And Amir, the founder, has been hinting at this on Twitter for the longest time. And hopefully those go live soon. So I think where you look, if you just take the time and you do the research, I think many people would be shocked to find how much value there is in this industry that is currently not being appreciated or currently being overshadowed either by the big assets like bitcoin, which rightfully so, are commanding a lot of attention and starting to institutionalize.
00:48:58.136 - 00:49:38.150, Speaker A: And at the lower end, meme coins, which, although they account for a fraction of activity in this industry, and I think even just the market capitalization of all the meme coins is still infinitesimally small compared to everything else. They command a disproportionate amount of attention, not just from mainstream publications and in Mediaev, but even among ourselves. Right. I mean, it's always funny if I go to a dinner with people in this industry, you'll spend half the dinner just talking about random meme coins. It's like hilarious that this is a focus and this has mind share when there are all these other things to be excited about.
00:49:38.690 - 00:50:16.724, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I don't know, it's. I mean, we just had kind of like a large. I wouldn't even say crash, maybe a slight correction in the markets. To me, they're never fun. But you zoom out in highlighting the conversation where you see deep end start to take off, you see maker with producing these revenues at a fairly large scale, you see the infrastructure is no longer becoming a bottleneck. You're like, holy shit.
00:50:16.724 - 00:50:31.204, Speaker B: This asset class is actually the fastest horse globally. And it's compounding. More and more people are coming into it, doing these interesting experiments. I wouldn't want to spend my time anywhere else.
00:50:31.332 - 00:51:06.070, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, that's why we're all here, right? Yeah. It's creating opportunities. I think that people aren't appreciating even at the more ecosystem level as well. We talked a little bit about Solana, Solana thesis and where Solana is today. But I think what gets lost in the conversation about Solana is the applications that are there and are starting to generate meaningful revenue. Because usually when people talk about Solana these days, it's just Solana and meme coins.
00:51:06.070 - 00:51:50.946, Speaker A: And that's the conversation. Solana versus Ethereum, solanaverse slesia, meme coins versus altcoins. Those are really the two big conversations people are having. But what people are forgetting is that, well, there's all the same stuff that exists on Ethereum that exists on Solana. And there are differences in how exchanges on Solana designed, how lending markets are designed. There's differences in strategy, for those teams. And I think what we've seen that's interesting in Solana is a lot more teams being more eager to vertically integrate or even just expand horizontally, learning the lessons of what are logical places to expand your business.
00:51:50.946 - 00:52:39.602, Speaker A: Based on how things have played out on Ethereum, there's some really attractive opportunities. I was actually quite shocked. We're not shocked, but I was pretty impressed. Looking at the data on could I mention that we did analysis on applications versus infrastructure and seeing who was generating what amount of fees and saw that 19 of the top 25 earning projects in the crypto economy are applications. I was actually quite impressed how many applications. Solana are generating tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue and are trading even lower multiples than their counterparts in Ethereum, which are probably cheap as well. And I think that's another story that people aren't quite paying attention to.
00:52:39.786 - 00:52:49.510, Speaker B: Don't leak too much alpha. If you continue to leak too much alpha, Solana's bid will just be relentless.
00:52:50.330 - 00:52:54.162, Speaker A: I don't think I have any control over that at this point. It's not enough appetite.
00:52:54.306 - 00:53:39.050, Speaker B: So I have about six minutes left on my camera recording before we have to cut this. But maybe as we're looking forward to the future, I think the overarching highlights of this conversation has really been around. Infrastructure is maturing, application engineers can focus on applications, and now there's actual sustainable cash flows, which is, I think, exciting to get institutionals and actually understand what should we try to value some of these assets, they're not fugazi. They actually have fundamentals. But when you're thinking about kind of rest of 2024, 2025, how are you thinking about that in the last remaining five minutes?
00:53:39.550 - 00:55:16.200, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think what I'm so at a high level, what we see is that, and this is, I'll overlay some of what's happening in markets as well, is that you've actually had many assets beyond bitcoin, and Ethereum completely reversed their moves in 2023, 2024, and they're now at bear market lows. There are some outliers, like Solana, that are substantially higher even after the pullback, but the rest of the asset class really has not done well. And it's almost like it's in a bear market. And like, why is that? Or what's changing? Well, you have many assets at bear market lows, not just in absolute terms, but also in bitcoin terms. But now you have, I think, these massive tailwinds over the coming years, which are the institutionalization asset class, which is going to widen the top of funnel for capital to pour in. You have as that's happening, more institutional investors that will start to get curious about what's going on in this industry beyond bitcoin and Ethereum, which have ETF's. And I think you start to see more funds, especially on the liquid side, get more inflows, which will be good for the asset class because we do just need more smart capital in public markets.
00:55:16.200 - 00:56:22.396, Speaker A: And then you also start to get a better regulatory environment as well. Where I think that, yeah, we're starting to get a better regulatory environment where as I think the Republican Party has taken a more extreme stance on the industry, talking about like a bitcoin strategic reserve and the right to self custody, I'm actually quite shocked how much they've embraced it. It's causing the Democrat party as well to shift more in favor. So it's making this asset class more inevitable regardless of who wins. And I think that's a massive win for the industry. And I don't think that's fully appreciated right now, just how much better it's going to be to be a builder in America and to be an investor in America in this asset class. And that will have, I think, very concrete impacts on projects where like take Defi for example.
00:56:22.396 - 00:57:16.494, Speaker A: If now you can just flip a vswitch on and start returning revenue back token holders, well, that makes those products more investable. If institutions and enterprises have confidence using on chain protocols, then that makes it more likely that we can actually go from one to 100 and get more users in adoption. So that's very exciting. And then the last thing is, and just to kind of hammer home, the point on the applications is we actually have applications that generate revenue. And that just wasn't the case last cycle where it was just all speculative food farming and all this other nonsense. We're doing Ethereum like nfts and jpegs, and we actually have, I think, really legitimate businesses here as well, where they're generating the revenue. And there's actually discernible competitive moats that they have as well that make them investable.
00:57:16.494 - 00:58:02.830, Speaker A: Because I think another challenge that people have when they start to think about this asset class beyond bitcoin and ethereum. Question I always get is how do you think about what is a moat for an open source protocol? Can it just be copied in a way? That thesis was tested in 2020 during DeFi summer when you start to have all the forks of Uniswap that turn on liquidity mining and just try to steal over TVO. And what ended up happening is uniswap still ended up being the number one project. I think you actually are starting to see real, discernible, competitive multimerge. And that's good. That's good, because you want to have these businesses be sustainable. You want winners to emerge.
00:58:02.830 - 00:58:13.030, Speaker A: That is exactly what we're all here for. We want products that people use. We want products that can scale. We want businesses that create big outcomes for the investors and the founders.
00:58:13.970 - 00:58:40.926, Speaker B: Well, I feel like we could talk for hours, but we're going to have to cut it there because my equipment's going to die. But Ryan, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. I think your journey is super insightful. You've been ahead of the curve multiple times. I'm sure that's going to continue going forward. Appreciate you coming on, sharing your thoughts and bullish what you guys are building. Where can people either LP's or anybody find you guys?
00:58:41.118 - 00:58:50.970, Speaker A: Yeah. So you can find us on our website, Singstreet IO. We have all of our writing and information on there. And then I also tweet a good amount on Twitter. It's Ryan Watkins.
00:58:51.470 - 00:58:53.366, Speaker B: Perfect. Awesome. Well, thank you, Ryan.
00:58:53.438 - 00:58:54.030, Speaker A: Yeah. Appreciate the time.
