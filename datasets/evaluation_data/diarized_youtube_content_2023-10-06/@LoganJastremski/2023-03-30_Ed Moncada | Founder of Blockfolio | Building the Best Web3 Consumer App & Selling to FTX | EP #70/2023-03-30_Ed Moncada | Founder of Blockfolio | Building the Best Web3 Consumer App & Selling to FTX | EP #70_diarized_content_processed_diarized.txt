00:00:00.320 - 00:00:31.158, Speaker A: In 2014, we kind of pulled $45,000 to get blockfolio off the ground. April, when consensus happened, I remember the server costs had been just increasing dramatically, and the user has been increasing dramatically. In that one year, the cost, our server cost went from $100 a month. In January of 2018, our server cost was $100,000 a month. We don't raise money soon, we're going to be broke in, like, three months. Everything between March or April and December of that year was a complete blur. Layups are just one of the most difficult things to do because we had such a tight company culture.
00:00:31.158 - 00:00:45.790, Speaker A: There's some painful moments. I mean, there was one time, there was one product manager we'd laid off. I remember him saying to me, like, I love this company so much that I'll work for free. And there's so many reasons why we couldn't have him do that. But that was, like, one of the worst feelings and one of the best feelings simultaneously.
00:00:48.770 - 00:01:21.300, Speaker B: Today, I'm super excited to be joined by Ed. Ed is the founder of Blockfolio, one of the most popular crypto apps in the industry. And I really. Ed and I talked a little bit prior to this podcast, and I think Ed has a unique background and really approaching product kind of from the traditional user point of view, which I think is a little bit uncommon in the blockchain world. So super excited to have this conversation and appreciate you coming on today, Ed.
00:01:21.800 - 00:01:23.380, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me. Logan.
00:01:24.720 - 00:01:44.200, Speaker B: I would love to start a little bit, just like, about your background, how you got in the crypto industry, what got you to start building, and let's start first with actually what pulled you into the industry, and then a little bit on how ultimately you decided to start building blockfolio.
00:01:46.180 - 00:01:51.280, Speaker A: So, yeah, maybe we got to start a little bit way back.
00:01:52.740 - 00:01:54.764, Speaker B: I was always going to start from the beginning.
00:01:54.892 - 00:02:55.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was a passionate skateboarder. It's probably an odd beginning for most people when they talk about crypto and love this sort of rebellious subculture, this counterculture that existed, and growing up in such a conservative state, being a minority and being passionate about something that was so kind of frowned upon back then. I don't know, I developed an affinity for, like I said, this sort of rebellious aesthetic that I would see in skateboards later on. I went on to become a professional poker player for about a decade. And even that, there's sort of, most people think of poker players, they think of the Wild west. And so there's sort of this sort of another like, kind of undertaking that was against the grain.
00:02:55.420 - 00:03:42.322, Speaker A: And then when I was introduced to bitcoin, I first kind of learned about it or heard about it in 2012, and then I invested in it in early 2013. And kind of when I first discovered it, what really appealed to me about it was just this sort of, again, it was this rebellious counterculture. It's much more ethos focused back then than it is today. And it reminded me of, like, these other two sort of like subcultures that I had an affinity towards. And that really kind of drew me into it. Like, the whole idea about decentralization, it was kind of, you know, giving the finger to the banks and to the governments and to the system in general. And that was really appealing to me.
00:03:42.322 - 00:03:54.106, Speaker A: That's how I got drawn to it. Right. And I think, and didn't dismiss it like a lot of my, I guess a lot of other friends did when they kind of uncovered it.
00:03:54.258 - 00:04:14.500, Speaker B: So I feel like a good majority of kind of people that have ultimately got drawn into the space have kind of come through the poker avenue. Can you share any specifics that you learned in poker that ultimately kind of carried over to the blockchain world?
00:04:15.440 - 00:05:10.260, Speaker A: So, I mean, there's a lot of lessons learned in being a professional poker player that translate well to running a startup is there's a lot of volatility. There's, you know, poker is just gathering as much information as you can and making good decisions and trying to not be results oriented and thinking more about the process. That's really kind of like a great training ground if you're going to go start a company. I mean, and then you also, there's so many highs and lows in poker. You get kicked in the ball so many times and you just get used to it and just continue to forge ahead. So you develop a lot of tenacity as far as why crypto might have surfaced very early on within the poker community. A lot of it is just like, it's just an easy way to transfer value.
00:05:10.260 - 00:06:13.500, Speaker A: And especially in a high stakes in the poker community, they discovered this and embraced it pretty quickly because there are a number of reasons why people don't want to haul around lots of cash with them, right? And when you play poker games, I mean, some of these games where people are winning or losing, you know, 50,000 plus dollars in an evening, this becomes a really great way to deal with those transactions. So once the poker community kind of found out about it, then they all. They did what I did, and they just started digging into it. I mean, I went, I remember when I first found bitcoin and I started learning about blockchains, you kind of go in this rabbit hole. And I locked myself in the closet for about three months. And that was all I thought about to the point where it's a funny story, but it's also a little bit sad, but it's more funny. My wife was like, one day, I remember when I used to be your bitcoin, and like, don't worry, baby, you're my ethereum now.
00:06:15.400 - 00:06:44.960, Speaker B: That's funny. So, I mean, ultimately got brought kind of. I mean, embrace all the subcultures that kind of rejected kind of normal cultures that brought you into blockchain and poker, poker community, ultimately embrace crypto. How did you ultimately start getting more kind of the entrepreneurial itch in the blockchain industry.
00:06:47.620 - 00:07:25.468, Speaker A: That also kind of goes backwards, like, back. The answer to that question goes back a bit as well. Right? And again, it starts with skateboarding. And just being an observer of that industry, there was an inflection point that happened in skateboarding, where it kind of went from subculture to mainstream. When X Games happened in 1997 and the industry went through a complete growth phase. And I was just a participant in that industry, but I got to see where value would accrue, right? And it seemed to accrue to, like, the shoe companies and the media companies. And then.
00:07:25.468 - 00:08:33.110, Speaker A: And then I was in poker. And in poker, I was a professional poker player, but I wasn't an operator, right? And so in poker, went through its real massive growth phase, I think in 2004, when Chris Moneymaker won the main event of the World Series. And then it was, they also, you combine that with the introduction of online poker sites combined with the whole. The whole card cam that they had on the tables, and then poker became very interesting to the mainstream and went through a massive growth phase. And in poker, value accrued to the casinos or the online poker sites, right? And when I came across crypto, I was both a participant actively investing across early cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, and some others. But then I realized that I wanted to be an operator. In 2014, we started blockfolio.
00:08:33.110 - 00:09:33.410, Speaker A: The summer of 2014, I had my hands in a few different projects, just kind of like, just seeing what was going to stick. And I would say somebody had shown me this app called Pocket Crypto, and it was really just a home screen of blockfolio. And it was developed by this senior in college at the University of Kentucky named Peter Lau, who wound up being my co founder so I saw this happen. I was like, wow, I'm already in. By summer of 2014, I was already invested in probably like 15 different crypto projects. And I was like, wow, I really kind of, and I was on Bitcointalk form, and I kept seeing every week there was more and more projects being announced and trying to raise small amounts of money. And it didn't take much to kind of think about the future and realize that there's going to be many different, like, thousands of blockchain projects that are going to surface.
00:09:33.410 - 00:11:07.660, Speaker A: And so I reached out to him and I was like, hey, I think there's a future for this app. Like, we can add some bells and whistles to it, like charts, alerts, news, and really make it something really useful. And also, we both believed that there was going to be this future where there was like 10,000 cryptocurrencies, or blockchain based projects. And so we decided to kind of reskin it, rebrand it, and build blockfolio from it. And I would say one of the important things to remember, or that I shouldn't even say to remember, one of the important things that a lot of people probably don't realize is back in 2014, all the vast majority, with the exception maybe like, two of crypto apps, were bitcoin only apps, especially, like the price trackers, right? Like, you could look at the price of bitcoin and you could input how much bitcoin you had, right. And I think at the time we started blockfolding, there might have been like two or three apps that had just started kind of branching out to maybe having like six to twelve cryptocurrencies listed on it, right? And we were the first people that were like, no, we want to create a portfolio tracking app where you could track all cryptocurrencies on all exchanges, right? And we would just, and we had devs that would focus full time on just adding every new project that came out on every exchange. Like, we didn't care.
00:11:07.660 - 00:11:08.500, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:08.660 - 00:11:28.072, Speaker B: And especially in 2014, I think that had to be, well, now, in hindsight, I mean, kind of an obvious decision, but at that point in time, I feel, like, almost sinful to embrace these other communities outside of bitcoin. I'm sure there is a little bit of pushback from that.
00:11:28.136 - 00:12:11.744, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I was in some of these whale trading groups with these bitcoin maximalists, but some of them that I respected that were excellent traders and speculators. And I remember one of them specifically telling me, blockfolio is stupid. It's never going to work out because bitcoin is going to be the only cryptocurrency that matters, the only project that matters, and everything else is going to go to zero. And, you know, so it took a lot of, like, conviction, right, to just say, like, that's fine. Like, we believe in this, we want to build it. And, like, really what we were doing is we were building something that we found useful for ourselves, and it turned out that everybody else did.
00:12:11.744 - 00:12:40.930, Speaker A: And so we. And we figured if we're going to make a. If we're going to take the time to build this for ourselves, we're going to try to make it really professional and see where it goes. And then for the first two years, actually, first year and a half, not a whole lot of people used it. But we were just in the telegram group asking people what features they wanted and kept building that. And then 2017 rolled along, and all of a sudden, it seemed like everybody wanted to use it.
00:12:41.870 - 00:13:16.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, could you talk about. I think. I mean, obviously, crypto is very cyclical. Uh, kind of, maybe that first year or two and some of that journey, like, even from the company standpoint, uh, the culture, um, I've always, um, the people that I've talked to that worked at blockfolio always spoke very high of the culture that you and the team built there. So could you talk about building in kind of these bearer markets and ultimately how that kind of shifted once the momentum kind of picked up in 2017?
00:13:19.000 - 00:14:09.282, Speaker A: So, yeah, so there are a few things, right. Aside from the rebellious subculture that crypto was back then, I was really drawn to kind of, like, the ethos of it, right. It was democratizing finance, it was this decentralization. And when we started building blockfolio, we sort of had a couple of thoughts as we were building this product. Obviously, when you're building a business, you want to build a sustainable business. That's true. But I feel like our approach was a lot more like, we didn't want to charge for this app.
00:14:09.282 - 00:14:27.284, Speaker A: We wanted to make it, like, keep it free for everyone to use as long as possible. Even though it was, like, hurting. It wasn't. I wouldn't say hurting us. It was just like, we just. We. Yeah, we wanted to keep it free as long as possible, even.
00:14:27.284 - 00:14:33.240, Speaker A: And we sort of had this philosophy. We wanted to put the user first and the ecosystem first.
00:14:33.740 - 00:14:34.156, Speaker B: Yep.
00:14:34.188 - 00:15:58.616, Speaker A: And especially in 2016, 2017, you started seeing a lot of scams, and we had this realization that if, like, if we focus on trust, that it was immensely valuable and we were going to draw in a lot of users, and that was sort of like, one of our most important intents. And there was that, and that, that kind of approach in every decision we made at the company, like, business decision, we'd always ask ourselves, like, how do we want to be treated, or how do we put the ecosystem first? There's another thing that I would do is there were so many, I'd been through a couple of cycles at that point, and I'd seen so many people come in when the prices are ramping up and then just lose interest when you hit a bear market and leave the ecosystem. So we had this policy at Blockfolio that you had to be invested in crypto for at least a year or two. We didn't want to hire anybody that just recently showed up because the price had been running up. And that was something we were really, we were very adamant about as we were interviewing or bringing people on board. And so that really kind of, like, filtered out. It just left us with only believers.
00:15:58.616 - 00:16:25.120, Speaker A: Right. And so when you combine these sort of two things, right, very ethos driven company, and, like, a purpose, combined with, like, people who had, like, you know, they'd been in the, already been in, like, a bear market before and stuck it out and really believed in it, and it didn't, like, send them away. That, I believe, was, like, those were, like, two of the biggest contributors to creating a great culture at the company.
00:16:25.920 - 00:17:18.750, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I always. I mean, you always read in these various kind of startup books how important culture is. I think in some point, some people ultimately can underemphasize that, but the ones that get that correct really kind of have the magic sauce that are able to carry them through the hard times, especially when you didn't have that many users for the first year or year and a half of building your company, could you share a little bit more? I mean, obviously, in 2017, things started to turn around quite a bit. With the bull market, with Ethereum starting to gain a lot of traction and then ultimately having quite a significant number of icos done on it. Could you talk a little bit about, like, that time and what the team was experiencing kind of through that hyper growth?
00:17:19.850 - 00:17:52.490, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's so crazy. Between, when we launched Blockfold in 2015, it took us about a year to develop it. There was, like, really four of us were working part time on it. And between 2015 and January of 2017, we picked up about 8000 monthly active users. Very modest, right? From January 2017 to January 2018, we went from 8000 monthly active users to 2.2 million monthly active users and about a million daily activities.
00:17:52.490 - 00:18:16.890, Speaker A: And here's the crazy thing, it was a zero dollar customer acquisition cost. It was all organic, word of mouth growth. So we were literally on Telegram asking people what features to build, and we were trying to build them as fast as we could and adding as many crypto projects or as many blockchains onto the platform as we possibly could. As fast as we could. Right? And it started. I remember it was consent. No, it was a.
00:18:16.890 - 00:18:52.078, Speaker A: What was it? Consensus. The conference in New York. I think it was like April of 2017, when I started seeing, like, when I really kind of started realizing. Let me back up a little bit. So in 2014, we kind of pulled $45,000 to get block fully off the ground. And our monthly costs in January 2017 were about dollar 100 a month. Right? And by April, by April, when consensus happened, I remember the server costs had been just increasing dramatically and the user has been increasing dramatically.
00:18:52.078 - 00:19:11.610, Speaker A: And I met with my co founders and I was like, if we don't raise money soon, we're going to be broke in like, three months, right? And so the cost had gone. In that one year, our server cost went from $100 a month. In January of 2018, our server cost was $100,000 a month.
00:19:13.430 - 00:19:14.398, Speaker B: What a big difference.
00:19:14.494 - 00:19:50.778, Speaker A: It was insane run up, and it was just a whirlwind. So it's just getting massive users coming in. A lot like venture capital firms were reaching out to us about our growth. They'd kind of been watching, they've been tracking our growth on some of the online sites where you can track them for mobile apps and websites. And I remember April, we raised $300,000, I believe, three or 400,000. And to his credit, Dan Matachewski at CMS holdings was one of our first investors. Larger investors.
00:19:50.778 - 00:20:34.340, Speaker A: Right? And then in November of that year, we raised 3.15 million, and it was led by founders fund through their Pathfinder entity. And everything between March or April and December of that year was a complete blur, because things were. And I think it was. The crazy thing is, I remember, if I remember correctly, it was like October that we were having of that year. We were having server crashes, October and November. And it was like, if I remember correctly, it was before fundraising round and they still wanted to invest in us heavily.
00:20:34.340 - 00:20:39.632, Speaker A: So, I mean, these were like, the good problems to have. I guess that's how they viewed it.
00:20:39.656 - 00:21:30.648, Speaker B: Exactly, yeah. I mean, so, I mean, going from one hundred dollars to one hundred thousand dollars of monthly kind of server costs can definitely be frightening, I guess, during that time, I mean, there was a lot going on. You raised that first round and then ultimately the second round were those. I mean, it sounds like they were fairly easy rounds to raise with just the amount of traction that you had gotten. How did that ultimately affect, I think you said there was four people initially kind of working on that application. How did that affect your team's growth or hiring or throughout that, like, 2017 cycle, did too many things change, or was it just kind of all hands on deck 24/7 it was actually, when.
00:21:30.664 - 00:22:21.874, Speaker A: I look back on, it was even crazier than that. So in 2015, right when we launched, our co founder, Ken Feldman, left the company. He was the user interface designer and wanted to go pursue another project. And then in 2017, at the time, I was actually in charge of business development and kind of helping recruit team members, and the CEO was Charlie Mason. And we just had a misalignment of vision in 2017, and he stepped down. In October of 2017, I took over as CEO, and that was about. It was actually, this often happens, I think, when you have, like, I shouldn't say often happens, but it happens sometimes that co founders will part ways.
00:22:21.874 - 00:23:25.164, Speaker A: It just, for us, was really unfortunate because it was right in the middle of a fundraising round and one of the most crazy times for the company. And so on, top of having this crazy growth server crashes, I had to take over as CEO in the middle of a fundraising round and still managed to land some top tier investors. And it was one of the most exhausting. It was surreal and it was just exhausting and emotional times. But having the ability to course correct the ship and have it continue going forward, I think was incredibly. It created a lot of trust between the staff and myself, between the employees and myself. I think it really kind of like, I don't know, I felt like that was where I'd earned, like, my position as a leader at the company, definitely.
00:23:25.164 - 00:23:28.240, Speaker A: And it was just nuts.
00:23:29.140 - 00:23:58.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure. I guess from going from, like, being involved in crypto from the early days and seeing some of that secular nature was, did you think, like, 2017, it would kind of result in the same thing? And were you in the team kind of planning for that, or did you kind of anticipate, as often a lot of us do, that maybe this time is different? And that didn't really kind of foresee what was going to happen with kind of the market correction.
00:24:02.670 - 00:24:57.708, Speaker A: Yeah, we got. We got wrapped up a little bit in over hiring in late 2017, early 2018, and then in February 6 of 2018, the SEC chair came out and said that they viewed all tokens of securities. And sure enough, over the course of the next year, a lot of subpoenas started dropping and the market was declining as people realized the magnitude of this decision, among many other things, and our burn was too high. By December of 2018, we had to go through a round of layoffs. And it was really one of the layoffs are just one of the most difficult things to do. And for us in particular, I think, because we had such a tight company culture, it was just, there was. There were some painful moments.
00:24:57.708 - 00:25:20.440, Speaker A: I mean, there was one time, there was one product manager that we had laid off. We'd laid off. And I remember him saying to me, like, I love this company so much that I'll work for free. And there's so many reasons why we couldn't have him do that. But that was like, one of the worst feelings and one of the best feelings simultaneously, you know?
00:25:21.270 - 00:25:54.786, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, maybe, like, jumping a little bit forward to today, I mean, in being kind of gone through that lesson of kind of a lot of excitement in the bull market, VC's knocking at your door, wanting to invest, maybe getting slightly ahead of your skis, and then the market kind of cracks. What would your advice be to founders today? Maybe in a similar position to you and the team and that, that 2018 timeframe?
00:25:54.978 - 00:27:23.120, Speaker A: So, yeah, no, I feel like I've learned a lot from blockfolio. Like, one of the things I kind of like just being attuned to the macro cycles are really important. I mean, a lot of these emerging technologies go through these, like, boom and bust cycles as they surface, right? And there's times when capital is cheap and there's times when capital is very expensive or non existent. And your job as a CEO at the top is really to kind of, like, keep one eye on the future and kind of see where the cycle, like, have some intuitive sense about where the cycles are going to be, because you're really just trying to jump from lily pad to lily pad and raise as much capital as you can, as cheaply as possible to make it through to the next lily pad. And hopefully along the way, like, your thesis is correct and you get product market fit and your technology or app or whatever it is that you're building grows into a sustainable business. And there were a couple of times that blockfolio, in our journey, where we found ourselves with three months of cash left and had no idea what we were going to do. But in hindsight, kind of, had I been a little bit more kind of forward scene.
00:27:23.120 - 00:28:01.120, Speaker A: I probably could have eliminated a lot of stress for myself and the company in anticipating kind of like these cycles, right? And. Yeah, but it's so much easier to say in hindsight, right in the moment. I mean, there's so many different factors. Like, everybody was just looking at crypto during these cycles and just thinking it was continuing forever. But I don't know. We're really fortunate to have thread the needle very well and have such a positive outcome for the company and for the employees.
00:28:02.380 - 00:28:16.700, Speaker B: And ultimately, you mentioned cutting burn, but were there any other unique things that you and the team did to ultimately continue to survive, position yourself well for the next bull market?
00:28:17.000 - 00:28:50.252, Speaker A: So in 2000, we were really fortunate because Coinbase only ever listed bitcoin and ethereum for a very long time. Like, they. They went deep, I think they were even until, I think it might have been late 2016 or maybe 2017 before they started adding new coins. Right. And so we have us customers that were opening up binance accounts or other exchanges. And so there was a need for blockfolio. And I think Coinbase's decision there really helped us.
00:28:50.252 - 00:29:48.180, Speaker A: Right. If Coinbase had listed every cryptocurrency available, there would be probably very little need for blockfolio. And as the industry started evolving, all the exchanges started realizing it was just table stakes, and you start listing as many coins as they could. And also, what naturally happens when they start doing that is that a lot of the features that make blockfolio novel are going to get adopted by these exchange apps. Now Blockfolio is stuck in the spot where what made us so great and useful to everyone is slowly. Is slowly going away. And we saw that even in 2018, early 2018, and we also realized that there was a lot of scams going on in that cycle.
00:29:48.180 - 00:30:45.690, Speaker A: And so we came up with the idea of blockfolio signal, which is a direct communication channel from projects to the token holders. And of course, we had a very clear idea of what everybody was holding or what they were interested in, because they would input it into the blockfolio. And then our idea was to build a dashboard and allow verified token projects to communicate, to broadcast updates directly to their token holders. And that actually pretty significant development for the company. It sort of countered this sort of like, it basically helped us stay very important as an app, even if exchanges were listing every cryptocurrency. And we're kind of like adopting many of our features. This was novel to blockfolio.
00:30:48.630 - 00:31:06.678, Speaker B: That got implemented in the bear market after kind of the 2017 crash. I mean, were there any things that that feature specifically surprised you by, like, the communication, or did it ultimately just result in people being more engaged in blockfolio and application?
00:31:06.854 - 00:32:18.390, Speaker A: So we really never got to fully develop it the way I would want it, the way I wanted to. I mean, we eventually had like over 500 projects that were broadcasting updates through it, right? Even with bitcoin core developers and Ethereum developers were on their broadcasting, and that was fantastic. But sort of the original, one of the original ideas was like, it would be amazing if this was sort of a sort of a first move to blockfolio, enabling voting to be done through the app, right. And for any, like, governance system, like at its foundation, there's a communication layer and we're like, wow, we like, we're like this sort of like mission control for a lot of the updates between token holders and the projects, right. And maybe this can transform into something that embraces governance later on. It would be pretty awesome to think of like, you know, incorporating wallets in the blockfolio and then having token verified communications and then eventually voting where you could have like, you know, a pop up that was like some vote that was needed to happen. And it was just very simple.
00:32:18.390 - 00:32:41.450, Speaker A: It was done through the app. But then we were acquired and they sort of valued our acquirer was FTX, and they really valued the users of blockfolio a lot more than they're an exchange, and they wanted to focus on trading in the app and less about these sort of forward thinking features.
00:32:42.550 - 00:33:24.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I definitely want to get back to the acquisition, but maybe like jumping back to kind of some of the things that you did in the bear market to, like, continue to push things forward. I mean, ultimately kind of cut the burn rate, had to do a series of layoffs, and then really kind of focused on this communication channel. Was there anything else that you kind of did or were extremely focused on those kind of more difficult times? And then when did you ultimately realize that the next cycle was kind of upon us? And when did you see that shift in, like, user performance or user metrics?
00:33:27.800 - 00:34:15.210, Speaker A: Bear cycles? Yeah, like, if I was doing blockfolio all over again and going through these cycles, some of the things you realize in hindsight is in the bull cycles. Your viral coefficient is so high, and if we were to spend money on ads, there would be so much tailwind on every dollar spent in bear markets. There is no viral coefficient. Nobody wants to share that they're losing money in crypto. They're not going to show each other their portfolio or something. Right. But what you can do in bear markets as an entrepreneur is there's a lot of brand alignment that you can do, like partnerships, where you're visibly getting aligned with another brand.
00:34:15.210 - 00:35:04.267, Speaker A: Like, we did a partnership with Masari in the bear market. Right. Because we saw them as one of the high quality actors in the space to put Masari to info into our app so that our users could see a lot of Masari metrics and information about cryptocurrencies through the app. And I sort of. I remember giving an interview in, I don't want to say it was August of 2020, and it felt like we had pretty much bottomed out. And I thought of another bull cycle was coming in, and a lot of it had to do with. It was August of 2021.
00:35:04.267 - 00:35:43.010, Speaker A: The habiting the next avenue happened in bitcoin. I don't have any quantifiable idea whether or not that really impacts prices because there's less selling pressure on the market, but sometimes it's like the narrative existing itself that causes everyone to buy. Right. And so I was like. And I just started kind of feeling like we were at the bottom and there's another cycle that was starting, you know, that was catalyzed by that sort of event. Right. And, yeah, I mean, it was a.
00:35:43.010 - 00:36:14.124, Speaker A: A lot of it, and we'd have gone through, like, a pretty decent consolidation period for a number of months prior. And you were just kind of seeing these sort of signals in the market. If you were paying attention, that's like, wow. I mean, it could obviously could go lower, but it didn't. But at the same time, like I said, there was sort of these events that historically had, like, change the course of the direction of the market. Right.
00:36:14.172 - 00:36:14.420, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:14.460 - 00:36:18.040, Speaker A: And you started seeing that in the end of 2022.
00:36:19.820 - 00:37:17.780, Speaker B: I personally started to get super excited once I saw kind of Ethereum defi summer start to happen and composability with all the food tokens and yield farming that started to go on, that kind of comps kicked off. And to me, that was like, all right, it's happening again. And I think one of the big things that caught me for a surprise and kind of this last cycle was specifically nfts, that for me, I was shocked how big it became from a culture standpoint. But could you talk about some of the lessons or events that happened leading up to the acquisition and even going into this bull market? How did you, from the product side of things, did you see more activity in the application? Um, and what ultimately, I guess, drove FTX to acquire uh, the blockfolio application.
00:37:21.720 - 00:37:42.980, Speaker A: Yeah. So we, we were, after we tried. So there's kind of. Where did I go with this? Yeah. So in 2019, we were trying to figure out how to get value to create a blockfolio, but we didn't. We were just a data and information platform. Right.
00:37:42.980 - 00:38:27.960, Speaker A: And some of the key decisions we'd made along the way for blockfolio, as we were, we were growing at the time, were incredibly fortunate decisions. For instance, we early on decided never to touch tokens. Like, we didn't want to be a wallet. It would have required an order of magnitude more capital resources, more developer resources, security. There's so many reasons it would have been real load for us to do that. And we were so light, it allowed our team to stay fairly nimble. But by 2019, as we were developing blockfolio signal, we were still very far ahead of governance.
00:38:27.960 - 00:39:15.510, Speaker A: And the communication through blockfolio, we just didn't think it was something we could charge for. And we were still mostly making revenue through online mobile ads. Sorry. We were still mostly making revenue through mobile ads. And by the end of 2019, early 2020, we realized for us to really be viable as a business, we're probably going to need a partner with an exchange and be the front end and have maybe like a white label relationship with them. And so we started reaching out to all the large exchanges. We spoke with Huobi, with Coinbase.
00:39:15.510 - 00:40:00.068, Speaker A: We almost had a deal with Tagomi to be our exchange partner, and then they were getting acquired by Coinbase. And so that prohibited some terms that we wanted from getting into the deal. And then we walked away from that. And then we eventually reached out to FTX and they were. And Sam was really open to it. There are a few more things that kind of led to. It just seemed like we were looking to be an exchange partner, have them as an exchange partner, and it seemed like just like, obvious that maybe we should consider them, having them buy us.
00:40:00.068 - 00:40:29.750, Speaker A: They were. At the time when FTX started, there was a lot of institutional trading that was going on the platform, but they didn't really have a retail presence. Right. And we were the kind of like the symbiotic opposite. We had all the retail users and very actively using the app. I mean, the average daily active user on Blockfolio was probably opening the app over twelve times a day. Right.
00:40:29.750 - 00:41:15.670, Speaker A: And so it seemed like a very harmonious fit. And so we just started talking about an acquisition, and it made a lot of sense. But going from talking about an acquisition to actually getting acquired is like very difficult thing. One of the things that we decided to do, which was a little bit of a risk, is we ran some pop up ads in blockfolio and allowed people to sort of pre register to sign up with email for an upcoming trading. For an upcoming trading feature we're going to build out. Right. And usually whenever you kind of run one of these pop ups, like, you're pretty excited if you're getting 5% of your users to, like, submit their email address.
00:41:15.670 - 00:41:49.340, Speaker A: I think we ran about 500,000 of these pop ups in the blockfolio app, and we had 29% subscription rate, which was insane. I think that was the real key metric that FTX looked at. They were like, wow, these users are extremely loyal to blockfolio, and they can't wait for this new trading feature to come out. And then it made a lot of sense for them to acquire us as a company. So I think just, you know, from our. I think without that, it would have been a completely different conversation. Right.
00:41:49.420 - 00:41:49.844, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:49.932 - 00:42:02.440, Speaker A: And the reason why it was risky is because, like, I mean, that data could have come back bad. Right. And so, and so it worked out heavily in our favor. And that, I think that was the catalyst that led to the acquisition.
00:42:03.580 - 00:42:14.650, Speaker B: Can you speak to how long, I mean, from those initial talks to ultimately, how long it took for that acquisition to be cemented? I know you mentioned it was kind of an arduous process.
00:42:15.470 - 00:42:56.624, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I remember correctly. We first started talking about it in early April, maybe early to mid April. And then I want to say it was June 11. We'd had conversation by June. By around mid June, we decided that we wanted to move forward with an acquisition. We'd had them look under the hood for a number of weeks, look at all our metrics, meet with a lot of the employees. And then from mid June until mid October is how long it took for the attorneys to draft all the documents.
00:42:56.624 - 00:43:31.540, Speaker A: And there was a whole due diligence process, which is one of the most painful things I think I've ever gone through. They basically looked at every contract we've ever written. I mean, it was like there was. It was administratively like an intense undertaking. Right, to tee this thing up for the acquisition to happen. But in hindsight, six months is actually, it was about six or seven months. It was really fast acquisition, but a lot of it had to do with, like, both sides really wanted this thing to happen.
00:43:35.650 - 00:44:02.152, Speaker B: On that front. I mean, ultimately, once the acquisition did close, do you recall any of the metrics of how many people were actually using blockfolio at the height of that past bear market, I think you said they were opening it twelve or 13 times a day, which is extremely impressive. But do you have any user metrics on at the time of our point of time, at the time of our.
00:44:02.176 - 00:44:27.488, Speaker A: Acquisition, actually, like, we were just getting out of our market, so our numbers weren't as impressive as the prior bull cycle. Right. So if I. I don't remember the exact numbers correctly, but I want to say there was probably three or 400,000 daily active users at that time. And then. And they were. I mean, actually, in a roaring bull market, our users are opening up the app probably like 15 times a day.
00:44:27.488 - 00:45:03.020, Speaker A: And, like, the worst of the bear market, it's probably around, like, eight to ten times a day. It's still pretty good, but it's not. Yeah, it wasn't. And then our dau MAU ratio during a bull cycle is probably around 55%, which is like that of a very healthy, like, social network. And in a bear market, probably somewhere around, like, between 35 and 40%, which is still fairly strong. But we were so spoiled. We thought it was just like the end of everything, and so many people would kill to have those metrics.
00:45:05.840 - 00:45:20.110, Speaker B: Can you talk at all a little bit post acquisition, how do you feel like, if any, blockfolio change? And then after that, I do want to talk a little bit more about what you're doing today with protofundental.
00:45:21.040 - 00:45:22.940, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you repeat the question one more time?
00:45:24.280 - 00:45:35.460, Speaker B: After the acquisition did happen, was there any big changes that you feel like you realized after the acquisition happened, either through the product or just company culture?
00:45:36.960 - 00:45:59.410, Speaker A: Yeah, there was a misalignment in the end. FTX was very engineering focused, and they wanted to get features out as fast as possible. They moved really quickly. In fact, they would almost. It felt like they were getting things out. Five, six, complete sometimes. On the other hand, of blockfolio, we were very product focused.
00:45:59.410 - 00:46:43.702, Speaker A: And I think this is the difference between coming from a realm of servicing institutional investors versus one of servicing retail consumers. So when you're servicing retail consumers, you really care about the user ratings on the play store. You care about. It's a little bit, I believe, more artistry. And when servicing institutional investors, it's a lot more quantitative. Maybe they care about the dollar so much, it's like if you do them wrong, but you're cheap, they'll still use your thing. You know, like, if the cheapest alternative.
00:46:43.702 - 00:46:56.886, Speaker A: Right? Or if, like, your fees are lower, you know, they'll, they don't. They'll overlook whatever issues might have happened if they, if they're still able to, like, make more money using your platform. Right?
00:46:56.958 - 00:46:57.558, Speaker B: Yep.
00:46:57.694 - 00:48:11.586, Speaker A: And, and so these inherent kind of, like, different philosophies in the protein product, I think eventually kind of came to a head. And so we eventually had a lot of, a lot of our managers, within a year of, like, the acquisition of blockfolio, were just leaving the company. I was there for about three months, and we were going to launch an app called Balance, which is going to be like a yield generating app. And the idea was that it was just, I think the idea is you wanted to service that next wave of people that were going to be interested in crypto, that weren't risk taking speculators, and that maybe wanted to just generate yield from a crypto app. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, at the 11th hour, they pulled the plug on that project. At that point, I just was a bit exhausted, and I realized I was probably better off just stepping away from FTX. And it was a painful decision at the time.
00:48:11.586 - 00:48:51.056, Speaker A: In hindsight, it was a great decision, but, yeah, it didn't feel right. I think a lot of it came from a clash between the different approaches that the two companies had. Right. And then I went on to start, I decided to start protofund and start investing in projects in the space. I was kind of loosely working with Jonathan Chu, who was our head of product of blockfolio. And yeah, I want to say that was. When was that? Mid 2021 when I started kind of like actively like.
00:48:51.056 - 00:48:56.300, Speaker A: Well, I'd always been investing in projects in the space, but then I decided to get a little bit more professional about it.
00:48:57.270 - 00:49:14.530, Speaker B: Perfect on that front. I mean, could you share a little bit more about what proto fund is, what you're looking for on the investment side, or kind of on a high level, how you view the fund and the projects that you're interested in in this space.
00:49:15.550 - 00:50:09.256, Speaker A: Yeah. So proto fund is really just the personal money of John and myself. We don't take any outside investors, and we'll invest anywhere from $100,000 to, like, we've led rounds in startups, sometimes invest as much as 3 million. And really, for us, what it is, is like, John and I are just like, love to build, and I think we've had a great partnership. John's background, he was before, even before blockfolio, he has had a product at Flipagram, which eventually got acquired by Bytedance and rebranded as TikTok. So he's one of the best product people I've ever worked with. And we found ourselves having this really kind of like simpatica relationship where if we both are like really excited about a project, it would usually work out.
00:50:09.256 - 00:51:13.170, Speaker A: And so, and he's looking at it from a different lens. He's looking at more from the product lens. Right. And I'm more looking at it like, where does it fit within the ecosystem? What is the probability of like, this is going to matter be a relevant project? I kind of am a lot more attuned with bet sizing, looking at the valuation, making sure that everything makes sense from a quantitative perspective to make the investment. What we tried to do, we tried to do what we did with blockfolio is find an opportunity really early, have this sort of thesis about where the world is going and see if it fits within there. Then what we want to do is roll up our sleeves and help with fundraising, marketing, product, like across the board, anything with hiring, we try to help in any way that we can. We've kind of been through the trenches in almost every way in every area of the company.
00:51:13.170 - 00:51:57.688, Speaker A: We've over hired, we've had short runways. We've like, you know, spent time trying to find product market fit, like. Yeah. And figured out how to get organic growth with a zero dollar customer acquisition cost. And like, a lot of these lessons are like, extremely valuable for young entrepreneurs and we know the pitfalls and so, yeah, so we basically try to do what we did at blockfolio, but we tried to like make these high conviction bets. Like, we don't make a ton of bets because it's our own money, I think, you know, a lot of times people raise a lot of money and then they just, they, they get the fees from it, so they deploy the capital. Like, that's not really our approach.
00:51:57.688 - 00:53:03.810, Speaker A: So we like, we take our time and look for things that we really believe in. So, and another, I would say is a, like, we're constantly trying to look at the next cycle and think about like, what is it that's really going to matter? Right. And that's kind of like try to kind of make an estimation of like, try to, like, yeah, just, yeah, just how well can we predict the next cycle? Like, we'll have some convictions about it based on the prior cycles and what we've learned and try to find startups that are probably about two or three years ahead of what's going to be important so that the market comes to them. Right. If you're doing where the market's at that time, you're surfing the way that everybody else is trying to surf.
00:53:04.390 - 00:53:39.710, Speaker B: Right, definitely on that front. I mean, ultimately, 2022 had quite a few surprises. I mean, FTX being one of them, Luna Terra kind of people being over leveraged kind of extremely long. Where, I mean, what today, I think, what lessons, I guess, did you take personally from 2022 and then going forward looking to 2023 in this next cycle, are there any specific categories or area of focus that you are excited about today?
00:53:41.450 - 00:54:12.012, Speaker A: Crypto cycle of 2022 is my dog in the background. Billy Ray. Have a seat. Come on, sit. All right. Whatever you can be in the frame. So the crypto cycle of 2022 sort of cemented some, like, some things that restart that.
00:54:12.012 - 00:55:18.060, Speaker A: The crypto cycle of 2022 was another example of leverage just blowing everything up. It did that in the 2008 real estate market crash, and then we just saw it happen again. And I think, for me, I wouldn't be surprised if I see other industries surface that have similar environments, but it's just going to be that much more clear to me in the future. Right. As I started thinking about what's going to matter a lot in crypto, if we have another, if history repeats itself, we'll have another bull cycle in 2025. Right. I think what's going to matter a lot is like, and you started seeing a little bit of, you started seeing this in the last number of years, throughput matters like you need tons of.
00:55:18.060 - 00:56:04.220, Speaker A: There are going to be massive amount of needs for transactions coming in. There's going to be all sorts of blockchain use cases that are going to be surfacing. And my suspicion is that no individual layer one is going to be able to handle everything. And so I have a pretty high conviction that value is going to accrue to high throughput layer ones and to bridges and like, you know, cross blockchain projects. And it's not that, I mean, that's not like something that's just that earth shattering of realization. But what we found is that we wanted to just focus on that. Right.
00:56:04.220 - 00:56:27.030, Speaker A: But it doesn't mean, like, a good example is. Yeah, like, we invested in mistin. Right. We'll invest in Solana. And we think when the next bull cycle surfaces, a lot of value is going to grow over these projects. Now, we also invested in, like, the intersection. Oh, sorry, go ahead.
00:56:27.890 - 00:57:13.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we're at frictionless, very much excited kind of, for these high throughput chains as well. And I think, I mean, I, crypto in some sense was so small it didn't need them at the earlier stage in its life. But as we start to actually onboard tens of millions and hundreds of millions, they're definitely going to be a necessity. But I think today that is like a contrarian opinion because a lot of people are either focused on like L2s or different kind of scaling solutions. So there are different approaches. But I would say, at least from my point of view, the vast majority of people are not exclusively focused or particularly watching these high throughput networks with a keen eye.
00:57:15.470 - 00:57:24.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's, it's just like data consumption. I mean, it just kept growing exponentially. Right?
00:57:24.934 - 00:57:25.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:25.742 - 00:57:59.870, Speaker A: And it's just so insane how much data an individual is like, creating now that they're connected to everything. Right. And I think blockchain are going to follow something similar. And even though there's all sorts of like, novel ways of going about it, I don't know, I just feel like not one ecosystem is going to be able to support everything. Right. And we'll see. I mean, that's sort of the bets that we're making to, we make some other bets too, like in the intersection of NFT and DeFi, stuff like this that we've looked at.
00:57:59.870 - 00:58:52.150, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think the ones that we're most excited about are going to be these high throughput blockchains. And at this point, remember what I said earlier on is that value will accrue to a small number of projects in any industry as it surfaces. There are going to be so many different types of projects in crypto that just aren't going to accrue value. And we've gone through such a bull market that it's sort of like, deceived us. There's been so much growth over the last number of years that it seems like everything is going to accrue value, but it's not. I think it's going to be more important than ever to pick the right winners at this point, you know? Yeah, I don't know.
00:58:53.290 - 00:59:21.760, Speaker B: I fully agree on that front. I mean, do you think, I mean, obviously or in your point of view, these, like, high throughput layer ones will accrue value? Do you have any other examples of, like, things that you're excited about that will accrue a value and maybe like one or two examples of areas of focus that you think may gain a lot of traction but not kind of accrue the value that these other kind of parts of the ecosystem will?
00:59:23.980 - 01:00:46.036, Speaker A: The short answer is, like, no users matter so much, especially as, like, the ecosystem is going into mainstream adoption. Right. And the real question I ask myself is a crypto project going to come up with a killer application that's going to draw in a gazillion users, or is a project that exists in Web two, has a gazillion users going to add a blockchain, add a crypto component to it and become the killer application. We've been doing some investing in web two projects where we think they have the opportunity to acquire a lot of users at scale. Right. For instance, we invested in nestment, which was a fractionalized real estate project, because we sort of saw this future where sort of a few stars intersecting one. We think that like, you know, Gen Z and kind of the younger generation is sort of like dismissing the idea that they're going to be able to buy a home.
01:00:46.036 - 01:01:13.240, Speaker A: Right. So we feel like they're going to start buying a home. Right. And then the other thing too is like, I really believe one of the best use cases for blockchains is going to be to transform real estate title. Right. And, and we were sort of wanting to figure out how to invest in something early on that might be able to, that might be a sweet spot where that value is going to crew. Right.
01:01:13.240 - 01:01:27.506, Speaker A: And so that's an example of, like, we want to invest, we're investing in web two that we think has the potential to scale and then where like, the users matter more than the, than anything kind of thing.
01:01:27.628 - 01:02:08.910, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm always, I mean, always shocked when I look at the user metrics, even from the past bull cycle of applications that are on chain. It's in the low millions and most of them only have even low couple hundred thousands of lifetime users, not even like monthly active users. And so I definitely echo all your statements that users will matter and probably be the most important thing. And there's going to be a variety of different flavors of how that happens, but the users are paramount. And I think hopefully the users will pull us out of kind of some of this cyclical nature that happens just because of speculation.
01:02:12.050 - 01:02:45.776, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, yeah. So I don't have a better answer for all that. Yeah. It's almost like a cynical view. Right. It's like I've, like, I feel like, but also if you look at like the.com bubble back in 2001, there used to be companies like organic that were like these webshops that were creating websites for like Coca Cola and big corporations.
01:02:45.776 - 01:03:21.194, Speaker A: They charged like a million and a half dollars. Right. And then now it costs like $50,000 to get like a website put up that they were, that's better than what they were doing back then. You're starting to see this, too. In the crypto space, to launch a token is not as complicated or as prohibitive or as expensive as it used to be. That's just going to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper as more and more people get interested in the space. That's where my suspicion is that you're going to have some of these web two projects with really big user bases.
01:03:21.194 - 01:03:43.698, Speaker A: Might be where you find the killer. Crypto app surfaces from that, right? Yeah, I almost have, like I said, the civil views. I got more faith that that's going to happen. Then some crypto projects are going to get product market fit and, you know, be the million to one shot that ends up onboarding like, you know, a gazillion users and that are constantly using the app, whatever it is project they have.
01:03:43.834 - 01:04:17.576, Speaker B: So makes a lot of sense. Well, no, I will probably wrap it up there, Ed, but I really, really appreciate you coming on the podcast. Appreciate you kind of sharing your early journey into crypto, how you scaled blockfolio, how you kept the culture within the team, going through the high points, the low points, and then ultimately getting acquired and now starting protofund and continuing to invest in entrepreneurs building the industry. So definitely appreciate your time and appreciate you sharing your wisdom. Thank you.
01:04:17.728 - 01:04:18.640, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me.
