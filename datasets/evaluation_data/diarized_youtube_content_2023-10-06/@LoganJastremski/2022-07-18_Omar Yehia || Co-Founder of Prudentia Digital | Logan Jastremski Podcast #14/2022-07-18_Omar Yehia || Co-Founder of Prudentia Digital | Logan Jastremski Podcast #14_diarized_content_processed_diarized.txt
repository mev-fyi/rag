00:00:00.200 - 00:00:02.570, Speaker A: Three, two, one, go.
00:00:04.590 - 00:00:07.406, Speaker B: No, I'm excited to do this, man.
00:00:07.478 - 00:00:10.726, Speaker A: Finally doing it. It's only been, what, like, six months?
00:00:10.838 - 00:00:13.822, Speaker B: We've known each other for a little bit of time. We met in New York.
00:00:13.926 - 00:00:18.310, Speaker A: We met in New York. We met in New York when you were doing the podcast with Sam.
00:00:18.470 - 00:00:21.890, Speaker B: Yes. Did a podcast with Sam. Shout out, Sam.
00:00:22.870 - 00:00:23.230, Speaker A: No.
00:00:23.270 - 00:00:40.162, Speaker B: And then I think my biggest thing was, I was super surprised you lived in Miami. I don't know. I think it's. I don't know what I expected when I moved to Miami, but it's. I've met a lot of cool people, and it's been awesome hanging out.
00:00:40.346 - 00:00:52.586, Speaker A: Yeah. I can't tell you how much fun it's been, but, yeah, we. It's funny. What were we doing? We were at the penthouse in New York for, like, the token launch party or something.
00:00:52.658 - 00:00:54.506, Speaker B: For the Sam.
00:00:54.578 - 00:01:11.842, Speaker A: For Sam. That's right. Yeah, that's right. And I was like, huh? I remember we were at the bar getting drinks, and she was like, what do you want? And I was like, I have no idea what I want. Just, like, give me something. And then you made some sort of snarky comment. I was like, who are you? Like, I'm Logan.
00:01:11.842 - 00:01:24.910, Speaker A: Who are you? I'm like, I'm Omar, I guess. Then we just started talking, and 30 seconds later, we're talking about, like, hardware and parallelization, and that's. And he was like, wait, wait, wait. Who are you again? I was like, wait, who are you again?
00:01:25.550 - 00:01:44.478, Speaker B: So, no, it was good. No, thank you. I am excited to do this. I think you'll share some spicy takes and let the world know who you are. But maybe we could just start off with who you are, what you do, and how you got to this point.
00:01:44.654 - 00:01:57.770, Speaker A: Okay. I'm not sure where to start. So I'm Omar. Yeah. That's how you pronounce my name. Actually, my first name, it's Omar. But anyway.
00:01:57.770 - 00:02:20.350, Speaker A: And I spent a lot of time outside of crypto, and I was in academia, and I was very interested in, like, a lot of very esoteric topics, more on the applied math side and the applied physics side. Nothing to do with cryptography, nothing to do with finance or economics, just to do with.
00:02:21.210 - 00:02:21.594, Speaker B: Just.
00:02:21.642 - 00:03:06.242, Speaker A: I was infatuated by how the world works. And more importantly, I was really interested in, like, how you model and how you interpret the way things are. And when I was younger, I had this almost. Almost this, like, crazy hypothesis that, like, everything could be, like, quantified, and you can write down an equation that explained everything and it was just a matter of, like, finding that equation. And if you look at, like, the history and, like, the pursuit of science, it was a lot like that. It was a lot of just very crazy, very ambitious people that thought, like, if only I was smarter as a person or as a scientist, I could just write down an equation that would describe these things. And at first, I thought, surely we could do this for the material world.
00:03:06.242 - 00:03:50.870, Speaker A: Surely I could do this to describe the moon and the sun and the stars and the ocean and things like that. And humanity's made a lot of progress. And so that, I thought, was very inspiring. But then I thought, okay, what is sort of missing? And when I was younger, I was really interested in human behavior. Could you write down simple mathematical equations that model human behavior? And I would sort of, like, do this. I would, especially in college, I would go out with people, and I would run these little experiments of mine, or I would meet someone, and I would try and do the scientific method on that person. I'd be like, who is that guy? And what's my hypothesis as to what makes him tick or makes her sometimes with girls, what made them tick? And then I would go back home, and I would sort of, like, on these little index cards, I swear, this is a real story.
00:03:50.870 - 00:04:33.711, Speaker A: I would, like, try and, like, mathematically model that person and, like, think from, like, a game theory perspective. How was this guy? Or this guy go, how are they inclined to behave? And. And this was very amateur, but it was stuff that I was learning about at the time. This was when I started uni, and I just. I was always fascinated by that idea. And I as I've gotten older, I think I've become a little bit disillusioned with the idea, not because I don't fundamentally think that we live in a material world and everything could be quantified, but it's because it's really, really hard. And, like, prediction, I've learned you have to really take with a grain of salt.
00:04:33.711 - 00:05:11.524, Speaker A: And it is extraordinarily difficult just because of the sheer number of parameters that govern, like, the way anything behaves. In a very reduced setting, we can model things. And I think science is not the rule. It's actually the exception. Only in the scientific world can you isolate physical phenomenon, and you can write down a simple set of governing equations that actually faithfully describe the way the system works. And you can go and you can replicate these experiments, and you can test your hypotheses. This in no way is in the purview of, like, the social sciences.
00:05:11.524 - 00:05:38.380, Speaker A: When we talk about, like, human behavior, that's fundamentally why I don't think it's, like, plausible to think the way I used to think, because you cannot have a simple platonic, like, experiment. People call this, like, the ludic fallacy, this idea that you can. That the world conforms to very, very simple models. Only a very, very small corner of the world sort of behaves like that, and that we call the physical and the material world. And, like, physics, that's sort of what we're interested in. Everything else they do with human behavior, I don't know. I just throw my hands up.
00:05:38.380 - 00:05:39.200, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:05:39.820 - 00:06:02.814, Speaker B: So that was more your youth, but then. Or in, like, your undergrad. But then you kept doing additional school and decided to continue your studies at Princeton and do a PhD. That's right. Maybe touch upon, like, what you did there and some of your, like, further learnings.
00:06:02.892 - 00:06:23.618, Speaker A: Sure, sure. So I'll tell you how I even ended up there. I. In my study for my second year in uni, I got really interested in, like, research. I would go to lectures sometimes, and I would. And I would sit down, and I'd realize, like, the lecture was, however nice they may be, they were still just telling me about what was in the book. So I said, okay.
00:06:23.618 - 00:06:38.868, Speaker A: I mean, it's probably easier if I just go back home and read the textbook. And that's pretty much what I did for, like, four years. So I said, okay, this is fine. There's probably not, like, a best use of my time. I should probably do something else. And so I would, like, walk around the departments, and I would, like, bother people and ask them, like, what it is that you're doing. Like, you clearly, you seem important.
00:06:38.868 - 00:07:11.334, Speaker A: You have assistants and, like, secretaries and, like, students running around, like, surely you do something important. Can I just, like, follow you around? And they would let me in their lives. Really, they would. At some point, they paid me, which I thought was ridiculous, because, like, what the what. What the hell do I know about any of this stuff? And they would pay me to, like, help them, like, do research. And, like, at some point, as a research assistant, I got promoted to, like, like, a research student or whatever, and I worked in, like, I must have. I must have done research in, like, three or four different departments, like, the electrical engineering department, the applied physics department, the aerospace engineering department.
00:07:11.334 - 00:07:35.934, Speaker A: I was just so fascinated by what people were studying, and. And a lot of it came down to, oh, I was really interested in, like, propulsion and, like. And. And rocket science is the, like, the sort of common term that people use. And I was like, why not? I mean, where I came, where I grew up, this was not something that, like, we had access to. I grew up in Egypt, and it's just not a thing. I'd never even seen a rocket sort of in person.
00:07:35.934 - 00:08:04.862, Speaker A: But when I came to the United States, you could go see these things, like, casually. So, you know, this seems, like, worthy. It's a very curious topic and worthy of pursuit. And so I did that for a while, and, and that's when I really got into, like, propulsion. And that led me to think about, like, the mathematics behind propulsion, and it got me into, like, studying fluid mechanics and chemistry and all of these sort of wonderful topics. And funny enough, at some point, there was not enough. I was.
00:08:04.862 - 00:08:32.650, Speaker A: I was hassling the departments to, like, teach me about or, like, allow me to sit in on these courses. And they're like, we don't have any courses that, like, fit the Venn diagram of your interests. And so what they did, which I thought was really hilarious, they let me come up with my own class. I literally went to the register's department. True story. And they made me fill out a form, and, like, as long as someone was willing to sign off on it, some of the faculty members willing to sign up on it, I could actually make my own course, and I could assign credits, and, like, they give me a grade on it. And it was fantastic.
00:08:32.650 - 00:08:55.390, Speaker A: And the first comment they had was, the name you chose is too long. It has to fit into, like, 40 characters or whatever. I mean, I came up with something. I was like, you know, who gets to pick their own class? I'm just gonna make a fancy class. And that was, I studied this brilliant professor at electro engineering department. His name is Peter Bomel. And he told me, hey, I wonder if we could.
00:08:55.390 - 00:09:25.642, Speaker A: I wonder if we could capture a lot of the waste energy. That leaves a lot of mechanical systems or thermodynamic systems. And I wonder if we could, like, mathematically designed, like, an optical system that does this. I said, these all sound like great ideas, but I don't know how to do them. He said, well, just come into the lab and, like, for a semester, we'll, like, this will be your course. And so he said, come up with a name for it. I just called it, like, thermal photovoltaics or something, which all that means is that you use, like, pv cells.
00:09:25.642 - 00:10:00.132, Speaker A: That's what photovoltaics are, to capture the sort of wasted heat. And we spent a lot of time writing these, you know, these, these solvers. That would, like, in three dimensions, allow you to predict how these systems would behave. And that's when I learned all about Maxwell's equations. And, you know, we can do it. Perhaps some of the most interesting equations in all of physics are Maxwell's equations. And the only reason is because they so accurately describe everyday phenomenon, but they're linear.
00:10:00.132 - 00:10:29.598, Speaker A: They are linear equations, which means they're. And like layman's, they're very, very simple to write down the solutions to. And they hold in, like, a variety of different conditions, which is a very, very odd thing. And it's very rare in physics, but they. They're named after this fella, I think he was a Scotsman, James Clerk Maxwell, who sort of the father of the theory of electricity and magnetism. And one of his great insights was that, like, electricity and magnetism are sort of two sides at the same coin. Anyway, I studied that for a long time.
00:10:29.598 - 00:11:03.530, Speaker A: And then. And then at some point, I realized I'm really interested in this idea of, like, research. You can actually sit at the frontier of what people know and what they don't know, and then maybe you can make a contribution. So after that, I spent some time, like I said before, studying, like, rocket propulsion. And at my university, we had this one very hysteric laboratory that was actually founded as part of the Apollo program in America, the program that sent man to the moon. And so they had these monstrous facilities that you could literally have, like, a proper rocket engine there. Not like a full scale one, but, you know, one that was big enough to, like, blow your head off.
00:11:03.530 - 00:11:25.710, Speaker A: And. And we would study these systems, and again, we would sort of, you know, think about, like, the kind of mathematical systems that you need to write down to be, you know, explain, explain the behavior of these things. And at some point, I ran out of time. They're like, you have to graduate now. You have to leave. And I was like, well, you know, can I stay? And they're like, you can stay, but you've been here long enough. You should probably go somewhere else.
00:11:25.710 - 00:11:57.142, Speaker A: And I said, well, fair enough. Who's willing to take me? So I just, I remember just emailing a faculty at Princeton and just telling them, hey, this is sort of what I do. And, like, I looked you guys up and, you know, it's clear that you guys are brilliant. And I've sort of learned a thing or two where I was, and I kind of want to continue to learn some more. And they were like, come on down. I was like, okay, easy enough. And then they said, oh, you know, I did this sort of PhD program where you have to sort of learn these sort of things, and then you can teach a little bit, and then you have to do some sort of original scientific research, and that's it.
00:11:57.142 - 00:12:39.574, Speaker A: I said, okay, that sounds fun. You know, fun enough, but funny enough, probably after I went. And part of the reason I went, and this is true, it was personal. Some of my heroes growing up were sort of Alan Turing, Dick Feynman, who's a physicist, I think he won the Nobel Prize in 1965, John Nash. All of these people, they went to the graduate college in Princeton, which is where I actually stayed as a first year. And the first thing I did when I arrived was just like, look for their rooms. And I actually ended up staying, actually, in Alan Turing's room.
00:12:39.622 - 00:12:39.926, Speaker B: Really?
00:12:39.998 - 00:12:57.920, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I was the father of the modern computer, the Turing machine. When we talk about, at some point, maybe we'll talk about, like, Turing, complete languages. Yeah, it's the same person, Alan Turing in the graduate college, I remember. And I was just. I was just so infatuated by the idea that you could walk in these giant footsteps.
00:12:58.500 - 00:12:59.532, Speaker B: He went to Princeton.
00:12:59.636 - 00:13:07.364, Speaker A: He went to Princeton for graduate school, I think. I believe he went to Cambridge for his undergraduate, but he did his PhD at Princeton.
00:13:07.492 - 00:13:08.412, Speaker B: That's cool.
00:13:08.596 - 00:13:22.994, Speaker A: Yeah, right before the war. And so did. So did Dick Feynman. In fact, Dick Feynman in, I think it was 1930, 919 40. He left. He was the. He was the only person to take the trains from Princeton to Los Alamos in New Mexico.
00:13:22.994 - 00:14:01.586, Speaker A: And because the war department at the time didn't want. Didn't want people to, like, realize what was going on, they told everyone, hey, make sure all the scientists from Princeton are, like, New York, like, Colombia, don't leave from the same stations because it would look suspicious. So Feynman, being Feynman, said, assuming everybody else does that, I could just leave for Princeton. Right? And so he walks up to the train station, and then the guy at the ticketing booth says, like, oh, so all of this stuff is for you? Because all of the lab equipment and all of the chairs and desks and all of the stuff that was leaving Princeton for everyone, the entire faculty, was just assigned to one guy. And so he was like, oh, that's you. And that was very sort of quintessential firing. But he left, actually, before even he finished.
00:14:01.586 - 00:14:31.334, Speaker A: He had to come back after the war effort to just wrap his stuff up and then, um, go on to be a faculty. I think he started at Cornell. Um, that was probably the peak of my, like, like, infatuation with the idea that we. That I can spend my entire life just working on, like, scientific problems. And it appeared to me that that's what these people did. That's what Paul Feynman, Richard Feynman, Paul Dirac, is it arabe, these guys, that. That.
00:14:31.334 - 00:15:15.704, Speaker A: It appeared to me that that's what they did. But then I realized that maybe that's not. Maybe that's not the world that we live in today. The way in which, like, academic research was funded back then, the way in which people chose which topics to study, the way in which advisors chose the students that they had, all of these things were materially different than we are today. And today I would say it's much more industrialized it. And I just. At some point, it didn't occur to me that the way I saw academic research being done around the world, it didn't occur to me that maybe that's what I'd be doing for the rest of my life.
00:15:15.704 - 00:15:56.590, Speaker A: But who knows? I was young. I still am young now, but at the time, I didn't know what to do. So I started asking myself, what is it that I like? What is it about this academic stuff that I really like and really enjoyed? And I realized there was probably a handful of things that really, really made me excited, but they weren't monopolized by academia at all. And these things were like this idea that I collaborate with people all over the world. We can work together on these very difficult problems and almost like, in secrecy because. And secrecy, not because we protected it, but it's because nobody else knew what we were doing because, well, because just, you know, it was a very niche topic, or it was an uninteresting topic the most. So there's almost like this band of people working together on these problems.
00:15:56.590 - 00:16:17.910, Speaker A: And the question became like, well, could I find this somewhere else? And so. And could there be more money at stake or could there be more, you know, could there be an incentive beyond just intellectual curiosity, which I think for many things is enough, but it certainly does not align the incentives of a lot of people. And so that's when I stumbled upon venture.
00:16:19.290 - 00:16:35.512, Speaker B: That's pretty wild. So going. I mean, you're very heavily in academia, you're doing all your studies, and ultimately stumbled upon venture. And then that took you to Arrington capital.
00:16:35.616 - 00:16:36.420, Speaker A: That's right.
00:16:37.080 - 00:16:39.500, Speaker B: And you were head of research for them.
00:16:40.280 - 00:16:54.414, Speaker A: We had, over there. We had. It was. It was a vehicle that we did venture from and liquid trading. So there's like a variety of different functions. At the fund. There's sort of.
00:16:54.414 - 00:17:42.762, Speaker A: Somebody was looking at ecosystems, somebody was looking at liquid trading, somebody was looking at ventures, somebody was looking at fund operations and stuff. My part was research and due diligence. This was part of the reason I joined, and certainly the part that kept me very interested was this idea that I could work on the technical aspects, whether it was just coming up with theses, whether it was thinking about the investments, whether it was doing due diligence, which was something that really interested me on the actual investments. So this idea that somebody's coming to you and saying, here is my proposition, here's the business model, and here is sort of a sketch of the architecture of how this technically could function. And I could just look at it and think, wow, this is interesting. There might be promise there, or, you know, this might not be. This might not be the best idea, or this might, like.
00:17:42.762 - 00:18:20.332, Speaker A: It might sound good on paper, but when you come to implement these things, they might not be, like, technically feasible. And I found great pleasure in that. Not because I like to fund things, but it was because I just thought that that's interesting. And as a, like, you're responsible for allocating people's capital, and so at the end of the day, you have to be completely and utterly aware of your circle of competence. What it is that you understand and what is that you don't understand. And what you do understand, you try and allocate capital to in a way that's, like, prudent and, like, try and do, like, investments that make sense to you and that you can justify later. And the stuff that you don't know anything about, you just stay away from.
00:18:20.332 - 00:18:28.684, Speaker A: And having no opinion is perfectly okay. I have no opinion on most things, but I don't invest in most things. I only invest in a small subset of things.
00:18:28.732 - 00:18:45.300, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's a very interesting transition, one, I mean, going into venture, but then also just, like, pivoting from into crypto. So could you talk? I mean, you kind of touched upon the adventure part, but could you also touch upon, like, why crypto?
00:18:45.840 - 00:19:23.554, Speaker A: Why crypto? So this is like, a very, like, funny personal story, but I suspect it's how lots of people that are not from the US, I suspect it's how they got, like, get interested in crypto. I got rugged. I got straight up rugged. The egyptian central bank in 2016 decided to lock capital so, like, inhibit the flow of capital outside the US and then remove the peg from the currency, which was pegged for quite some time. And into a floating exchange rate, and they straight up locked up the capital in the banks. You couldn't take dollars out. You could only keep them in local currency.
00:19:23.554 - 00:19:57.560, Speaker A: And they rugged us. And this was 2016. I was like, I mean, you know, man's been to the moon. We have vaccines. We have all of these sort of things. How is it that we haven't figured out this problem of money? How is it that we can't, like, I just don't have a vehicle by which, like, after I've worked and after I've earned some amount of, like, assets or capital accumulated or whatever, how is it that I can't store it somewhere? How ridiculous is that? And so I just thought, like, that time I got attracted to, like, the, like, the austrian school of economics, the literature of the austrian school. And then they started talking about, like, you know, of course you can.
00:19:57.560 - 00:20:24.268, Speaker A: You can store it in gold. And I said, nah, that doesn't seem like a great idea. Just seems a bit antiquated. Surely there is a better way. So that's when I really got into, like, cryptographically private money, secure private money. This idea that you can have a shared ledger and everyone can, like, attest, this is how much money you have, and everybody could see it, and nobody could touch it unless you. Unless they have your private key or your seed phrase.
00:20:24.268 - 00:20:42.196, Speaker A: So that I thought was fascinating. I said, great, so let me sort of try and, like, buy this stuff. And so I got into bitcoin. And so I remember this was. I was at Princeton at the time, and there was a vibrant community in the, like, the cryptocurrency space then. It wasn't called web3 then. It was just crypto.
00:20:42.268 - 00:20:42.996, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:43.188 - 00:20:58.542, Speaker A: So somebody had pointed me to the white paper. They said, you should go read the bitcoin white paper. I was like, okay. So I read the viking white paper, and I was like, this sort. This sort of makes sense. There's a lot of, like, mathematical ambiguity. Like, I knew this could not be it.
00:20:58.542 - 00:21:27.556, Speaker A: I knew the person who had actually, like, written the white paper and the person who, like, wrote the instant the implementation of it, they had to be at least different people, or at least, like, of different mindsets, because just alone, if you actually go back and try and replicate that paper, there's a bunch of, like, different mathematical mistakes in that favor. So it's not enough. I was sure that, like, I was just missing something. Surely there was more to it than that. And I talked to someone who I respected a lot and who's, you know, much smarter than I am? He said, yeah, but you know, it works fine. I said, okay, fair enough. So I'm just, you know, that was my little due diligence.
00:21:27.556 - 00:22:00.798, Speaker A: I was like, okay, I'm just gonna go buy some. And I remember it was a weekend, it was a Saturday. I said, okay. So I remember I allocated some capital to it. And then, and I came back the next weekend, I was like, wow, what? Now that I bought this coin, what do we do with it? And I went back to the same person and I asked him, now what? And he just sort of, you know, he was very cheeky, looked at me, he said, so have you heard of Ethereum? I said, no. And then he pointed me to, I think it was the Ethereum yellow paper at the time. I was like, now we're talking.
00:22:00.798 - 00:22:20.910, Speaker A: That was the one written by Gav, by Gavin Wood. And if you read that paper, you're like, ah, okay. So some deep thought has gone into how we go from just moving coins around to having a decentralized public state transition machine. And I was like, okay, now we're talking. So that's when that's sort of my light bulb moment.
00:22:21.290 - 00:22:48.148, Speaker B: It's super interesting. I mean, I think, I mean, yeah, the money aspect does suck. It's super interesting that even now in Turkey, I think recently with inflation, the last couple of weeks it's been reported like they have like 70% inflation, which is insane. But I think the now what part question is super interesting because you buy bitcoin and then you're like, okay, what else do I do?
00:22:48.244 - 00:23:09.436, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I realized only because like, you know, when you have money in your checking account, you use it for a lot of different things. You use it for payments, you use it, you know, to pay your rent, use it whatever you put in your investment account. Like there's a bunch of stuff that you do with it. But it occurred to me as soon as I put it in my wallet and I was like, there's nothing else to do with it. So I just thought it was odd. And this is from a very naive perspective, I was like, there's literally nothing else to do.
00:23:09.508 - 00:23:15.400, Speaker B: So now that you have a little bit more nuanced opinions, what is your point of view on bitcoin?
00:23:16.780 - 00:23:18.000, Speaker A: What do I do with it?
00:23:20.620 - 00:23:36.214, Speaker B: Do you think it's a good store of wealth? Or do you think ultimately like something else, like Ethereum, Solana, or any of these other smart contract platforms will serve a better purpose for kind of like store of wealth or medium of exchange?
00:23:36.302 - 00:24:00.810, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'll say a few things about that. First, when you have a store of value, it doesn't have to be exclusive. There can be multiple ways for one to store value. So to say that bitcoin is a good store of value does not negate that other things could also be a good source of value. And I do think bitcoin can be a good store of value. There is enough people who. And it is a good store of value not because of anything technical and not because of anything related to the code.
00:24:00.810 - 00:24:06.590, Speaker A: And this is something that I find strange that people continue to, like, propagate. It has everything to do with social consensus.
00:24:07.050 - 00:24:07.610, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:07.690 - 00:24:33.780, Speaker A: It's the same reason why gold stores at value very well. It's the same reason why some currencies store their value better relative to other currencies. Most of them don't on an absolute scale, on a purchasing power scale. It's because of social consensus. Enough people have bought into, or bought into in a voluntary way, in a voluntary sense, carry this idea that this can be a store of value, that it is a self fulfilling prophecy. And that's not a bad thing. That's fine.
00:24:33.780 - 00:24:55.150, Speaker A: But the only thing to remember there is that it has nothing to do with the code. It has nothing to do with the fact that enshrined in it somewhere is the fact that there is a fixed supply. Because with it, with social consensus, you can change the fixed supply. It's not a big deal. You make it deflationary if you wanted to. Everything about it can change if enough people want it to change. And that.
00:24:55.150 - 00:25:38.200, Speaker A: I'll steal a quote from Sriram, who was on your last podcast. He said something quite profound. He said, the most fundamental property, the defining property of any public ledger, is open state. This idea that if enough people look at the ledger and decide there's one agent doing something that we're not happy about, they can just fork the chain and they can move on with their lives. And in the same way, if enough people realize that we like this idea of bitcoin, but something about it doesn't appeal to us, maybe it's the fixed supply, maybe it's the consensus model, whatever. If enough people are interested, they will just fork the chain and they will move on. So it has everything to do with social consensus and very little to do with what actually the bitcoin core software does.
00:25:38.540 - 00:25:56.888, Speaker B: No, I like it. Bitcoin kind of is the gateway. But I do think, like, it gets a lot more interesting as you start looking at the Turing, complete blockchains, smart contracts, and start kind of like getting people to actually use the stuff and.
00:25:56.904 - 00:26:35.874, Speaker A: To be fair, because we don't want to like lean on. I mean there's been a lot of work on like the bitcoin core software development and people building around and there are environments of people who think it is interesting to develop smart contract like capability on bitcoin. I just think it's almost like a contradiction to the ethos of bitcoin. The reason why or a technical reason why it can work well as a store of value is because of the ossification it's achieved in terms of like, this is what it is. It's not going to change. It only does one thing and it does it very well and it's very decentralized and it very secure. So that's it.
00:26:35.874 - 00:26:48.498, Speaker A: That's it. And if you're, if you're, if you're happy with that, then I find it slightly contradictory to say, but we can also do other things or you sort of, you, you can, but then you undermine the sort of ethos that you had to begin with.
00:26:48.554 - 00:27:37.316, Speaker B: So I agree. Yeah, it's um, bitcoin. Uh, bitcoin's funny. Um, but anyways, no, I think it's just a super interesting story going from, um, I mean, kind of your beginning studies, trying to model everything and everybody to kind of doing more research driven with a PhD at Princeton and getting into venture. It's. I'm always fascinated by people's journeys because it's like, I think always like looking back, like everything kind of seems easy ish, but like, at the time and like making the decisions that you do, it's not like straightforward and like, it's very hard to kind of navigate the waters and to, I mean, end up where you are. So I find people's journeys fascinating.
00:27:37.428 - 00:28:07.958, Speaker A: I'll be completely honest with you. I had no idea what I was doing. I continue to have no idea what I'm doing. And to even like pretend that there was any sort of lineage that I was trying to do, it's completely ridiculous. When I was an undergraduate, I had no idea what I wanted to do after. When I was in graduate school, I had no idea what I would do after I had, like, if you had asked me two years in, when I was in graduate school, like in two or three years or whatever, you'll have your venture fund and you'll be deploying capital and you'll be working. I would have called it completely ludicrous.
00:28:07.958 - 00:28:21.238, Speaker A: It was so outside of the scope of my thinking and I think that's actually like the hallmark of growth. The hallmark of growth is that you end up on a trajectory that's completely unanticipated and so interesting that you think back and you look like, wow, how on earth did I get here?
00:28:21.294 - 00:28:37.122, Speaker B: I fully agree. I definitely agree. Well, maybe kind of jumping off from there. You were at this previous venture fund, and now you have your own venture fund.
00:28:37.186 - 00:28:37.794, Speaker A: That's right.
00:28:37.922 - 00:29:11.432, Speaker B: Maybe talk about that and then kind of like some things that you're doing at your venture fund compared to, say, like other venture funds. Because one thing that I very much appreciate about you is your technical background and your technical capabilities. And I've been very surprised by other venture capitalists in the space, or even the space in large part, of how non technical people really are that are investing in this space. Maybe just touching upon what you're doing and your interactions with other investors in the space.
00:29:11.536 - 00:29:48.500, Speaker A: Sure. I'm the managing partner of a fund called Prudentia digital, and Prudentia is just the latin word for prudence, and it's one of our guiding philosophies. We think we've seen enough investments in the space where because of the lack of prudence, things sort of went sour. And I've always thought it was an odd idea. Especially, it's one thing if you're deploying your own funds, this is a free country, you can do whatever you want. I mean, if you want to be completely degenerate and just blow it, it's completely your prerogative. I have nothing to say about that.
00:29:48.500 - 00:30:33.930, Speaker A: People should be, do you know they should be able to do whatever you want. But the second you raise capital, and the second people entrust you with their capital, you have a duty to them. And the first duty they have to you have to them is the duty of prudence. You have to take care of their capital as if it were your own, and you have to study every prospective investment as if it were your own and that you needed to protect it, and that it really, really resonated with me, that idea. And I thought it was so important that, I mean, people entrust you with their money, and money is in many ways freedom. It is literally a material representation of freedom. And if people disagree, just try having a lot of money, and then try having no money.
00:30:33.930 - 00:30:53.600, Speaker A: And compare those two states, and you will see the defining feature of the delta between those two states. One was much freer. You can get much freedom in your time. You get freedom of what you do and who you see and what you eat. It's just freedom. So when people entrust you with that, you have to be very careful and you cannot be cavalier. And so that's where the name comes from.
00:30:53.600 - 00:31:27.508, Speaker A: And the point of the fund is to allow us to deploy capital in the areas that we thought were very exciting and were very interested. And that's very, very early stage venture in Web three. We call it web3 now. Whatever. In crypto, in crypto primitives. And the reason we like early stages, we really, really like to build with people. We find it very, very fun and interesting and both personally and economically rewarding to work on projects before there is a real product, sometimes before there's even a real idea.
00:31:27.508 - 00:32:21.130, Speaker A: Sketching out the architecture, running a feasibility study, thinking about what it means to have a token, thinking about what a token is supposed to do, thinking about what kind of cryptographic primitive that we have today that we didn't have five years ago that enable us to do just these miraculous things. And perhaps we'll mention it later. For example, the validity proofs, or ZKP's in general, in their current form, they did not exist five years ago. The amount of stuff that you could do with them today, on a practical level, is just. It's amazing that we are here today relative to where we were five or ten years ago. And it really excites us to try and help people use these perimeters to build novel, either financial instruments, infrastructure, things that just don't exist. And the closer we are to that, to that genesis of that idea, the more excited we are personally and the more we think we have edge, the more we think we are able to contribute.
00:32:21.130 - 00:32:54.846, Speaker A: And it brings me to the second point that you asked, which is this idea of like, non technical VC's is how you call them, or non technical capital allocators. I just. I can't wrap my head around how one does this, how one allocates capital to the space or to any space. Forget, forget crypto, forget what you. Without understanding it. I mean, the example is. The example is like, I mean, did you watch Formula one or you're familiar with Formula one? You have teams that have a budget.
00:32:54.846 - 00:33:18.068, Speaker A: I think it's like $150 million, or it's there. And then they have to design the cars and design the engines and work with manufacturers and hire a driver and train the driver on the car. It's an extraordinarily sophisticated process for a race in which things are going hundreds of kilometers an hour. Now imagine I entrusted you with that responsibility. Really? Really. There's many analogies here. Imagine I trust you with responsibility.
00:33:18.068 - 00:33:57.192, Speaker A: And I came to you and I said, I need you to do a few things for me. First of all, I need you to, like, pick which car design is best, and then I need you to pick, like, the type of engine, or, like, the configuration of the engine that works best. And not only do I need you to tell me that now, I need you to predict what's going to be the dominant type of engines ten years from now. Adding to that, I also want you to tell me which features of the engine you think is most important and then which are replaceable and which are not. And what advances are. Are we going to get in, like, combustion technology that's going to, like, enable us to replace certain parts or modify certain parts, all of which is going to affect the performance of the car. Then you come to me and you say, what's an engine? How does it work?
00:33:57.296 - 00:33:58.232, Speaker B: I'm like, fuck off.
00:33:58.336 - 00:34:01.784, Speaker A: Right? I mean, this is a completely useless conversation.
00:34:01.872 - 00:34:02.336, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:02.448 - 00:34:12.151, Speaker A: And now I'm asking you, hey, by the way, he's $100 million, or he's whatever, here's a certain amount of capital. Go deploy it into. Try and answer these questions. This would be completely, completely foreign, but.
00:34:12.175 - 00:34:13.579, Speaker B: That'S what we've seen in the space.
00:34:14.559 - 00:34:30.919, Speaker A: That is what we've seen in the space to some. To some degree. And to be fair, we've seen that in, like, other spaces as well. But somehow something about crypto and perhaps it's a good thing. It's a good thing. It's a very low barrier to entry space, so people can approach it however way they want. But it doesn't mean that you get to be cavalier.
00:34:30.919 - 00:34:48.791, Speaker A: It doesn't mean that you get to be like, I don't want to use the word ignorance, because it's not. It's not ignorance. It's more just illiteracy. It's more just the content is there. This is like, for the most part, open source code. You can read it. And if you can't read it, if you're not inclined, if you're not interested, you can get somebody else to read it.
00:34:48.791 - 00:34:58.871, Speaker A: I mean, there are. There are plenty of brilliant, like, software engineers and, like, programmers that can read this stuff. It's not. It's not particularly complicated. And the stuff is there. You can read it. You just have to read it.
00:34:58.935 - 00:35:00.063, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:35:00.151 - 00:35:01.979, Speaker A: Especially when you're entrusted with capital.
00:35:02.359 - 00:35:43.286, Speaker B: No, it is interesting. I think I spent too much time reading for a long time. I locked myself up and just read a bunch. And then I started going to some conferences and I thought, like, the knowledge that I had was all kind of common knowledge, but I found out very quickly people did not know that much. And the stuff that I thought was common knowledge, Washington actually not very common at all. So it's been an interesting journey, just like talking with people in the space and the different people at the conferences.
00:35:43.438 - 00:36:24.182, Speaker A: But I think so adding to that, I think it exists in some fashion on the founder side, too. So I've spoken to enough founders to realize that that problem is pervasive and that maybe it might be equally dangerous. And the reason is, why choose build one primitive versus the other? Why choose build on one network versus the other? Like, truly you have either, like, some economic hypothesis or some, like, technological hypothesis, but many times you talk to founders and they're like, I just sort of, it's path dependent. I just sort of stumbled in onto this and I decided to do it. Or, you know, maybe there was a grant here, so I decided to work on this. And there's not enough thinking about the problem. There's always the immediate bias to jump towards the solution.
00:36:24.182 - 00:37:00.442, Speaker A: Let me talk to you about the product. No, how are we talking about the problem from first principles, which is something you're very good at. How about we just break it down? First of all, ask ourselves what it is that we're trying to solve. Why is this particular network uniquely capable of supporting the solution? And what are the features of the solution that need to exist for this to, like, actually be, like, to actually address the problem? Because in many times, we can be trying to solve a problem and realize that we're actually solving past the problem. We're solving something that's similar to, but not exactly related to the problem we're trying to solve. All of these things have to be at the forefront. They can't be, you know, we'll figure it out when we, when we write the fund deck, right? We'll figure it out when we write the deck for raising money.
00:37:00.442 - 00:37:24.392, Speaker A: If you're a founder, this has to be at the forefront and iteration, and, like, a heuristic approach to doing this is the way to get it wrong, and get it wrong often and, like, repeat the process. There's no shame in that. That is how, like, innovation works. Not pick one thing like, you know, throw dots at a wall and, like, the one that sticks, we run with it. No, no, no. Be skeptical. Be skeptical of your own thinking.
00:37:24.392 - 00:37:38.140, Speaker A: Be skeptical of what other people tell you, which, again, something I think you're very good at, which is why I like hanging out with you a lot is because we just get to do that a lot. We get to be very skeptical of ourselves and sometimes other people, and we get to learn that way for sure. Right.
00:37:38.480 - 00:38:10.140, Speaker B: Maybe kind of like touching on the founder side of things, especially now kind of with the Luna and the three AC stuff kind of exploding. How from, like, the venture capital side and valuations, how have you kind of seen those, like, reset or kind of going forward after not only this, but maybe even, like, comment on just like, how crazy things got, like, throughout, like, the past year and now kind of where they're at or where you think they're going to be going?
00:38:10.260 - 00:38:37.372, Speaker A: Sure, sure. Let's just take a step back. Let's see where we were about a year ago. A year ago today, July of 2022. So a year ago today, we were in the middle of, like, the explosion of, like, Leia two s, the new l one. So avalanche Solana, the NFT space was blowing up. I mean, this was just absolutely a carnival, just an absolute carnival of primitives.
00:38:37.372 - 00:39:01.576, Speaker A: It was amazing. It was amazing. It was a tremendous amount of fun. But the speculation was rampant. Absolutely rampant. I still remember because, I mean, I remember the avalanche work from a long time ago, from 2018, 2019. And I remember thinking, wow, why are people excited about this now? And so I just started to ask people, like, you know, do you know anything about avalanche? You know, why are you so particularly, because I remember at some point just people would not stop talking.
00:39:01.576 - 00:39:31.170, Speaker A: And it is a wonderful network and I'm a big fan, but I was curious why others were a big fan and nobody could articulate anything about it. I was like, hold on, this doesn't make any sense. Like, is this, like, you know, a counter bet on, like, maybe there's some aspect of Ethereum that you don't like and so that's why you like avalanche? Like, no, I'm like, so maybe. So surely you've stumbled upon, like, snowball and, like, how that, like, the consensus system works. And surely you're intrigued by that. What snowball? Just a lot of these conversations. I'm like, ah, so, you know, you've read the Ethereum roadmap.
00:39:31.170 - 00:40:04.500, Speaker A: You looked at, like, Gaspar, and I'm like, and, you know, you found this more interesting that they're like, what? You know, what's, what's gasper? So it just, it occurred to me then that even though the space had a lot of capital, at some point, I think the market cap of the space was two or $3 trillion, which for a nascent space was a lot of money. And nobody could still articulate. So I said, okay, we are clearly at the height of, like, like, a speculative mania, or not at the height of it. Of course. I. I couldn't. And nobody else could tell you exactly where the top is, but you could tell at least that we were in surely some sort of, like, you know, frenzy.
00:40:04.500 - 00:40:39.272, Speaker A: And I remember the private deals being done by then. It started with, you know, maybe a year before that, a seed valuation, a seed round valuation was a one out ten one. You raise a million dollars, you dilute yourself by 10%, you raise a million dollars. At a $10 million valuation very quickly became a 220, the 220 became the 330, and then the 330 became 440. And I think that's sort of where we stopped. We started getting a long tail of, like, really absurd pre product. Like, all you had was a team that had some perhaps relevant, mostly irrelevant backgrounds in something else.
00:40:39.272 - 00:41:02.874, Speaker A: Come to the space and say, this is the idea that we have ten page slide deck. Amazing. At $100 million valuation. And I'm just like, I come and I'm just, what? How did we arrive at this valuation? I'll take $100 million. I'll take a billion dollar valuation. Walk me through, please walk me through how you came up with it, and I'll be the first check in. And I never got an answer then, and I still don't get an answer now.
00:41:02.874 - 00:41:47.116, Speaker A: I just get lower numbers. I still get lower valuation. In fact, I was talking to someone the other day who was very, like, intellectually honest, and he told me, like, you know, six months ago, we were trying to raise this valuation exactly the same round, exactly the same terms. Now with all that happened with, like, public markets and the secondary markets, this is the valuation that we're trying to raise now, and it's dramatically lower, right? So I told him, okay, so what is it like, what is it that changed in the way you looked at your enterprise that caused you to change the valuation so much? He's like, the market tanked. I'm like, okay, that's great, but what are the prospects like, how did that change the prospects for your business? He said, no, no, no, you think about this wrong. It's not a science. It's an arthem.
00:41:47.116 - 00:42:25.432, Speaker A: So I thought it was very humorous comment, but I also thought it reflected, like, the ethos of the market in many ways. If we looked at the venture market a year ago, people were upset about these valuations being bid up. You go to a private round and it starts off raising maybe at 20 or $30 million. It gets interest for some investors, and some investors want to allocate a lot more capital. So there's no way to maintain the dilution except by increasing the valuation. So people would bid up these rounds. And if you think about, if you think about these private investments as nothing more than just a product, there's a supply and demand for a scarcity of this product with a high demand from a capital inflow perspective, will mean that the price of these things will go up.
00:42:25.432 - 00:43:19.962, Speaker A: So that's what happened. Now that the cost of capital has gone up and this is more macro has less to do with the crypto space and there is less liquidity and there's less demand chasing it, we shouldn't be surprised that the valuations are going down. Price of these things are also going down. But I have still not seen either a year ago, two years ago, or today, like simple reasoning about how one values a network, or not even a network, how somebody values like a company that's built like, behaves like a SaaS company on blockchain. It does a service, it has employees, it has a balance sheet, it has a p and l, and it's doing a service for someone, like a good example of this is all these staking providers. I mean, they're really just good old, like, businesses with a simple cash flow stream that you can model. And the pervasive type, the pervasive way in which people evaluate these deals and like, value these enterprises is not very scientific.
00:43:19.962 - 00:43:46.886, Speaker A: And I still find that surprising. But here's where we are today, and I think, I think there is a return of, like, to sanity. I think there's enough informed investors in the space that are able to come back and say, okay, we had to deploy capital at some point. And maybe we weren't happy with these evaluations, but we had to have some sort of exposure. And, or maybe we introduced a new mandate for exposure. So we just sort of, you know, we held our nose and we went in. Now we have a little bit more time, a little bit more space, maybe even a little bit less capital.
00:43:46.886 - 00:44:44.330, Speaker A: But, you know, we have time to think about these deals and maybe think about how we structure them. First of all, if you look at, if you look at how like, crypto venture deals are structured, they're very strange. If you, if you take like a term sheet or like, you know, for like a new l one, and then like the staff to the warrants that come with them or whatever, and you show that to someone from like, you know, Silicon Valley, you know, you showed it to like, any of any of any, I won't mention names. Any of those guys, they will look at you and be like, this is bizarre. What kind of terms are you guys doing here? What kind of, like, what kind of hustle is this? Right? The terms are so different because, like, the business prospects are very different. Like, in one case, you're trying to launch a network, and perhaps this network has a token, and this token is valued in some odd way, and it's distributed in some way very unlike what you would have in terms of like a liquidity event for like, traditional equity. So just even the structure of these deals are very, very different in crypto.
00:44:44.330 - 00:44:51.282, Speaker A: But I think we will see a little bit more sanity and I think we will see a little bit more traditional terms kind come to these deals.
00:44:51.426 - 00:45:52.054, Speaker B: And I also think it's good for founders in the long term. I mean, because if you raise at these crazy valuations and ultimately your product does not meet those expectations, then you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot, because when you need to raise capital, again, it's just a much lower valuation. So I honestly think it's healthier for the entire ecosystem. But no, it's interesting to kind of get your take on it, maybe to pivot a little bit from the conversation into some of the more technical sides. You and I talk a lot about blockchains and blockchain scaling. I think you have a very unique perspective, just with your background and the PhD and the math side on how some of these things work. So maybe touch upon your thoughts more broadly on L2s and kind of how you think those will fit into blockchain ecosystem going forward.
00:45:52.182 - 00:46:17.364, Speaker A: Sure. So this idea of a L2 is like, very qualitatively, it's as follows. We have a network, we'll call that the layer one. That could be ethereum, that could be Solana, that could be avalanche, it could be whatever. And the network is optimized for a certain type of behavior. It has a consensus mechanism. It has a certain number of nodes, or I, or an optimal target for the number of nodes.
00:46:17.364 - 00:46:42.912, Speaker A: It has a certain block size. All of these parameters that go into running a network. And it happens to be that the network is suited for not all functions, but a subset of functions. There are certain things that a network can do very well. An example of this would be like we talked about bitcoin. It's very, very good at being decentralized and securely transferring coins between one walleth. Solana has very high throughput.
00:46:42.912 - 00:47:16.274, Speaker A: It does that very very well, perhaps at the expense of other things. Right. Ethereum, for example, is a very decentralized state transition machine that allows people to like. It brought on this paradigm of like, composable programming, this idea that smart contracts, you can write them, they can be autonomous, they can execute by themselves, and they can interact with each other, they can share state, all of these sort of ideas, but it's suboptimal in many other ways. For example, Solana and Ethereum optimize for completely different functions. And the fact that we talk about them in the same breath is, I mean, it's like talking about sports. It's like saying, you know, basketball and football are related.
00:47:16.274 - 00:47:18.514, Speaker A: I mean, they're sports, but they do very different things.
00:47:18.562 - 00:47:19.190, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:19.850 - 00:48:06.732, Speaker A: So there came the idea, okay, I have a layer one that optimizes for certain functions, but I want it to do other things. Certain types of transactions with a certain frequency, with a certain latency, with a certain, with a certain variable level of security, for example. So can I start moving, like, can I start moving the execution burden, the communication burden, maybe even the data storage burden. Can I start moving these things off chain? And the word off chain just means not on the l one. I am somehow outsourcing this to somebody else that in some way is related, is tied back to the network. People say that l two s are, they're tied to the network in the sense that every once in a while they have to settle back to the layer one. Somehow they inherit the security of the l one.
00:48:06.732 - 00:48:55.222, Speaker A: That's how people like to talk about it. And the paradigm that started initially was with, like, distributed ledgers is let's do as much as possible on chain. Let's store everything on chain, let's calculate everything on chain. Let's communicate with each other all on chain, which works great when you have like a thousand users. The second you start scaling to millions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of users, you realize that the majority of these networks were not designed to handle that sort of throughput. Instead, the new paradigm is, well, how can I start moving things off chain? How can I without going back to square one? Square one is having a centralized operator asking them to update the state for me, trusting them that they will update the state correctly. I have no way to know whether they did it or, I mean, if you go to a bank today, that's essentially how it works.
00:48:55.222 - 00:49:38.406, Speaker A: You, you sort of give them your money, you assume that they protect it. You, I mean, I'm assuming you don't, you don't, like, monitor your checking account balance every single second, they could change it and you would not be privy to it. And they could change it simultaneously in a way that, like, you wouldn't be privy to it. So. And you just have to trust them. There's an element of trust, but what if I tell you, and that's not me, what if somebody could come tell you, I can bring back that element of centralization which might sound like, ooh, what are we doing here without trust? Right? I might actually get the performance of something that behaves maybe as a smaller centralized entity as opposed to like a very decentralized network. But I maintain some aspect of the justice.
00:49:38.406 - 00:50:08.736, Speaker A: And that's when the two flavors of l two s come in. Fraud proofs and validity proofs. And people refer to optimistic roll ups, things like arbitrum optimism. They use fraud proofs to achieve, like to achieve this type of layer too. And then ZK roll ups, people call them that. They're really validity roll ups that use validity proofs. And I make the distinction because you don't have to have like a zero knowledge aspect in a validity proof.
00:50:08.736 - 00:50:49.486, Speaker A: In fact, the Starks and snarks, which is like the, the primitives that are used for these validity proofs, they don't necessarily guarantee like zero knowledge. So it's just more accurate to talk about validity proofs. But they come in two flavors. Like I mentioned, one is optimistic, which assumes the following. It says, hey, I'm going to outsource a lot of these calculations. So people are going to, instead of submitting all of these transactions on chain one by one, I'm just going to submit them off chain to this operator who's going to batch them for me. He's going to send it to like a sequencer, and they're going to compress these transactions, which, by the way, you could do in any way you'd like, including using snarks and starks.
00:50:49.486 - 00:51:17.328, Speaker A: I've heard people discuss this idea that, like, starks are only for validity proofs. That's not true. You can actually generate fraud proofs with, like, starks and starks. But, you know, it's a minor detail. You generate like a proof, which is just a compressed version of an, like an attestation to something. You say all, you know, these thousand transactions that would have normally been submitted on chain, here's like press proof that they happened, and I'm going to submit them on chain and in an optimistic setup, and that's where it gets its name. Everybody assumes that you're not lying to them.
00:51:17.328 - 00:52:04.920, Speaker A: Everybody assumes that you're honest, but they're watching you and they're called watchers or sentinels or fishermen. I forget the exact terminology, but people are sitting there in like a glass room watching you make these little proofs and submitting them on chain, these proposed blocks on chain, and they are incentivized to catch you. If you start to, like, mess around, if you misbehave, or if you start presenting false information, or if you're acting in a way that's fraudulent, somebody's going to raise a flag and say, I think you're messing around, and here is a fraud proof. That's where it gets its name from. Here's a proof that you are committing fraud. And then everybody goes back and then recalculates the state transition and, and in front of everyone and says, there's an arbitration. There's a time period for arbitration.
00:52:04.920 - 00:52:51.286, Speaker A: And a jury of your peers says, aha, one of you is wrong, one of you is correct, the person was wrong, gets their stake. They have to bond a stake to be able to do this, get their stake slashed. But there's a few, like, there's a few good things about the way this is done, and there's also a few things that are not so good. The good things is actually the optim, like the optimistic nature of it is probably the most important and defining feature. What that means is you can actually get a lot of throughput and a lot more performance by assuming that everyone is behaving properly. Because that means is you only have to produce these proofs, these fraud proofs. You only have to produce them when somebody suspects, like malpractice, somebody suspects somebody is being fraudulent, but in general, you don't actually produce them.
00:52:51.286 - 00:53:32.192, Speaker A: So for the most part, people are just sitting there submitting transactions off chain. They're being compressed, they're being, they're being submitted on chain, and they're just, they're cheaper and they're faster than what's happening at the l one. And every once in a while, you set an l one and just, you get lower gas costs and you get high performance. Great. But the problem is what happens when I want to leave the system. And there's this idea of like, withdrawal delay. And because of the optimistic nature of the system and because you need the jury of your peers to checked, like, who was misbehaving and who was not, there is like a natural, like latency or period which people have to wait for people to produce the proofs and then for people to come in and check these proofs and to arbitrate between them.
00:53:32.192 - 00:54:28.672, Speaker A: So if you wanted to forever live on the l two, perhaps that's not a big deal. But if at some point, and you need to, because that's where the security aspect comes in, settle back to the l one and withdraw some of your funds to the l one, then there is this structural delay. Another thing is, if the application that you deploy on the l two tend to be very, very data intensive. So if you need to, let's say some application needs a lot of financial data, you need the weather data, you need a ton of different data points that are going to be made available. And remember, for these fraud proofs to be produced, all of the data that you use for the batching and to generate the proofs have to exist on chain. There has to be a native data availability layer there. Else, how would one be able to generate a fraud proof if you don't give me the data, you say, by the way, here are the new transactions, trust me, there's no way I can generate fraud proof.
00:54:28.672 - 00:55:03.728, Speaker A: So by definition, these optimistic systems have to have that data available. And if that data is very rich, that's quite burdensome. So these are sort of like the kind of trade offs that you get. And the leaders in this space have, of course, be like arbitrum and optimism, which people have followed for some time, and they are making real strides in the space. But I think it's still very, very nascent. But the one question that comes with the l two s, is there enough applications to even require that all of this work on the l two s? And I don't know if I have the answer to that.
00:55:03.824 - 00:55:04.360, Speaker B: Not yet.
00:55:04.440 - 00:55:52.036, Speaker A: Not yet. If you look at a lot of the, the l two s, the blocks are most empty. But to not skip the one that I have a bias towards, because I think it's mathematically elegant and I think it makes a lot of sense. Validity proofs is the other way of the other flavor of these l two s, and they require a completely different set of assumptions. They are sort of, if we call it fraud proofs or like optimistic, like optimistic l two s, and we'll call the validity proofs pessimistic. They assume by default that everything is false, and the only allowable state transitions are ones that are presented with a proof. So here comes the funny bit, and here comes the reason why perhaps the optimistic and validity proof crowds they can compete.
00:55:52.036 - 00:56:11.078, Speaker A: It comes from the fact that you assume that every single submission that occurs in an optimistic system is true and only once in a while, do you have to submit a fraud proof. The opposite is true. With validity proofs. For every single proposed state transition, you have to produce a proof. So it means you're generating proofs all the time.
00:56:11.174 - 00:56:26.970, Speaker B: Do you think over the long term, fraud proofs remain, or do you. And it's only validity proofs, or do you think they'll both be used in tandem? I'm curious about this.
00:56:27.890 - 00:56:50.642, Speaker A: I do think they lie on a spectrum, and this is not. I'm not trying to cop out, but I do think they, like the user, has a lot more say than you and I. The user can decide what kind of assumptions they're comfortable with, what kind of costs they're comfortable with. I personally think that ZK eats all, or like validity proofs eats all that. Everything can be enshrined in that framework. Everything can be done in that way. But I do think there is a room.
00:56:50.642 - 00:57:14.124, Speaker A: I mean, the validity proofs that we have today are still extremely nascent. I mean, we're still running a single starkware, which is the company that developed Stocknet and Stockx. They're the only ones running a prover. Running. It's still actually closed source. Nobody is, actually, nobody outside has the open source code to run these provers. That's how early it is.
00:57:14.124 - 00:57:54.292, Speaker A: So having an intermediary, something like an optimistic system, something like what arbitrum and optimus do, is very valuable. Now. Do I think that the. And it's one thing I forgot to touch upon. Do I think that they are there forever? I don't think so, and here's why. The, another fundamental difference between both these systems is the lockup of capital. The capital efficiency to to behave as a person who, like, batches these transactions or anything, is going on chain, and you submit it to a sequencer, and then they sort of submit it on chain as a proposed block.
00:57:54.292 - 00:58:06.980, Speaker A: You have to bond a certain amount of tokens, a certain amount of capital that prevents you from misbehaving, because like we said, at some point, if there's an arbitration and it turns out that you're wrong, you're slashed, and if the person who is accusing you of being wrong turns out to be wrong, they're slashed.
00:58:07.020 - 00:58:08.460, Speaker B: And this is all on the optimistic side.
00:58:08.500 - 00:58:57.798, Speaker A: This is all on optimistic side. There's no bonds at stake on invalidity proofs at all, because you don't require, you're not required to trust anyone. These are fundamentally like, they attest to computational integrity, and you don't need to put a bond in case that you are wrong, you can't be wrong, you can't be mischievous. But the problem is, and I'll steal another comment from Kevin, who was on the same podcast with Shuram. Kevin from Avalaz. I share exactly the same philosophy as he does, is I completely think that a proof of stake system works, and it's fantastic. And in principle, it really, there is like a non zero amount, a positive non zero amount of stake, or distribution of stakes that people can put up that can cause them to behave optimally.
00:58:57.798 - 00:59:48.250, Speaker A: I think finding that distribution of stakes is practically almost impossible, or that it requires extremely sophisticated, like mathematical modeling that I haven't seen. And so deciding what amount of stake is good enough, it runs into the same problem as proof of stake systems in general, which in general mean that I assume that you are economically incentivized to behave well. And the way I guarantee this is by making sure that if you behave well, you're rewarded, and if you don't behave well, you are penalized. I think the penalty by default should be the opportunity cost. But trying to introduce a slashing mechanism is again, principle, a wonderful idea. And I'm not contesting it, but I am contesting, like the practical implementation, it is extremely difficult. And by the way, I don't think there is, even on Ethereum, for example, you have to post in the Pos version, you have to put 32 ETH, for example, to be validated.
00:59:48.250 - 01:00:26.448, Speaker A: Why do we come up with 32? I mean, I know in the past it's technically inherited in order not to overwhelm the network at the time. That's how that number came. First of all, that number surely has to be dynamic, and surely it's very, very difficult to optimize for multiple things at the same time. In one case, they were optimizing for the bandwidth of the network. They were not optimizing for the economic behavior of the agents. But we're talking about an economic system, optimistic role of our economic systems at the end of the day. And so I just find it very, very difficult to believe that we have just come up with these systems and this is the number that we have to, this is the number of capital you have to stake, and that's how we're going to do it.
01:00:26.448 - 01:00:32.232, Speaker A: So I just, by default, I find it easier to think of a world in which we have validity proofs.
01:00:32.336 - 01:00:49.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I think kind of the optimistic side is kind of a stop gap until you have more robust validity proofs. I am optimistic over the long term, once these block spaces get saturated, we'll start to use them more.
01:00:51.780 - 01:01:28.364, Speaker A: And to be fair, like we haven't even given validity proofs, even like a real, like honest, honest shot. Like the libraries that we use today, the Cairo implementation that we have for Stocknet and Stockx, like this stuff did not exist five years ago. Like, actually, I'll tell you a funny story that's personal. I was my brother who studied computer science in the nineties. We were in a car together once in the past year, and I was on the phone, I was talking to someone and we were talking about ZKP. I was just mentioning the idea of ZKP. We were talking about some roll up, whatever, and I mentioned the word, I used the word zkP.
01:01:28.364 - 01:02:11.626, Speaker A: And at the end of the call we were still in the car and he looked at me and he said, hey, what did you mean by ZKP? Surely you didn't mean like zero knowledge proofs? I said, no, that's exactly what I meant. That's what we were talking about. He said, huh? Like these people use this now? And I said, what do you mean? Yeah, of course. He said, well, when we, when I was a student and in the nineties, if you study computer science, then our professors, they would tell us about all of these wonderful mathematical constructs and at the end of the lecture they would say, by the way, this is completely impractical. Like it would take millions of years to generate these proofs, just forget about it. It's a beautiful mathematical curiosity, but we'll never see it in our lifetimes. Yeah, I guess life they meant by lifetimes, like 20 years, because 20 years later, here we are, completely practical for the most part.
01:02:11.626 - 01:02:30.922, Speaker A: Practical. So this is where we are. So we have people who are not people in general, like critiques of validity proofs. I don't think they're certainly, they're helpful from a technical side, but I don't think they even give validity proofs a fair shot. We've not even been a few years in the Cairo white paper, for Christ's sake, was like a year old. It's not even a year old.
01:02:31.026 - 01:02:57.520, Speaker B: So maybe going off this talk more or like kind of getting more into like starkware and zero knowledge proofs and why you think they're so interesting, especially coming from like the math PhD background, why they're so fascinating one from like the technical aspect, mathematical point of view, but also how they're applicable to blockchains and how they'll be used kind of going forward.
01:02:57.680 - 01:03:49.132, Speaker A: Sure. So the one disclaimer I'll say about like zero knowledge tech in general, it has nothing to do with blockchain, like the idea of a zero knowledge proof or validity proof somebody attesting to. So, okay, let's make the distinction. A validity proof is the ability for me to solve a mathematical problem and demonstrate to you, approve to you, hence the name, that I've solved this mathematical problem without you having to re execute exactly the same amount of computation that I did in order to arrive at that solution. Because that would be moot if I asked you, and I'll give you a simple example if I asked you what the solution to a polynomial equation is. And let's say, for a simplicity, let's say it's quadratic, so it's squared, the highest power is x squared. And you come to me and say, omar, hey, this is a mathematical equation.
01:03:49.132 - 01:04:28.994, Speaker A: This is a quadratic polynomial. And I know the roots of this equation. I know the solution to this equation. One way to show me that you know the root, the solution of this equation is to actually tell me what the solutions are. Another way is to tell me, listen, instead of showing you how I like, solve this problem using like the quadratic formula, or however way you solved it, or like the intersection of lines or whatever, let me just show you that I know I can factor the problem, a polynomial into like the product of, into two products, polynomial a and polynomial b. Both are first order. And I know it's of the, of the form x minus a product x minus b is equal to zero.
01:04:28.994 - 01:05:19.050, Speaker A: And for, and I can prove to you that I know the value of the constants a and b are the solutions to polynomial because this exact equation for all values of a and b will exactly evaluate to zero. Aha. So you've demonstrated to me that you know the solution, but you didn't have to walk me through the entire detail. And it's not as complicated to verify. The same is true with like much more difficult, uh, uh, like, uh, polynomials, let's say, uh, 7th order, 8th order, it turns out these polynomials, there's no, there's a beautiful theory of mathematics that shows that like, you can't actually, uh, like write them down in closed form. So you have to solve them using computer, using a calculator. And if you had to like prove to me that, uh, or if I had to like check whether your answer is true and I have to actually solve the equation, it would require me to have a computer and like, relatively sophisticated understanding of like, how to solve equation, which I don't, I just take the numbers that you give me, and I just plug them into this equation and it always evaluates to zero.
01:05:19.050 - 01:05:50.666, Speaker A: I'm like, aha. So this is the idea of a validity proof that you can, you can demonstrate to me, after doing a lot of hard work, that you solve the solution, and I can verify that that is truly the solution in a relatively simple way. Now, the zero knowledge aspect of that is one more layer. It's that I can do that without even revealing what the answers are at all or betraying anything about the answer. And the famous example that people give, which I like a lot, is like the Alibaba cave problem, in which there is a cave, and that cave is. Have you heard of this one?
01:05:50.698 - 01:05:51.298, Speaker B: No.
01:05:51.474 - 01:06:12.796, Speaker A: This is my favorite. Some people use like the three color problem, other different type examples. This one, I think, is the most intuitive. It's not exact, but it's pretty close. There's a cave that's partitioned in the middle with a metal door. And that metal door has like a keypad, which you have to input a four digit password and it lets you in. If you have, if it's correct, the door opens and you go to the other side and it's in a circle.
01:06:12.796 - 01:06:49.418, Speaker A: So if we both stand at the entrance of this, like, circle, and the cave is on one end, the partition doors on the other side, the only way for you, for you to come do full circle and see me again is if you go through that door. I know that if I like, if I saw you, you must have gone through that door. There's no other physical way for you to get here. So I tell you, show me that you know the key, the answer, not the answer, rather the password. Show me that you know the password that you need to put in the keypad that unlocks this door. You say, okay, there's two ways for me to do this. One, I can just tell you the password, and you can go and you can drive yourself and it'll open.
01:06:49.418 - 01:07:12.768, Speaker A: That's not interesting, because then I betray to you what the password is. What if there was a way for me to actually demonstrate to you, with vanishingly small probability, that I'm lying, that I'm not lying to, and without actually telling what the password is? So you say, okay. I say, okay, I'm all here. Show me. You say, okay, you and I will stand here right at the door. Pick a direction. You remember, you can traverse the circle counterclockwise or clockwise.
01:07:12.768 - 01:07:56.800, Speaker A: You say, pick a direction and don't tell me what it is. In fact, write down on a piece of paper and don't show it to me. Write down ten different directions sequentially, and I will show you every single time you say go counterclockwise twice, then one count, then one clockwise, then twice counterclockwise three times clockwise, and every single time I will appear at the other side. So surely I must know the answer, like, and if I do this enough times probabilistically, with like, asymptotically converging probability, I can't be lying to you. And so that, that's exactly how these work. Now, the one thing that's slightly different is that this is like an interactive proof in a way that, like, I tell you, I have to tell you each time, and I can't give you the list beforehand because then you can sort of fake it. You can, like, you can go on one side, you can wait until I look away, and then you can go to the other side and sort of, you can't really know the list up front.
01:07:56.800 - 01:08:34.040, Speaker A: It has to be sort of encrypted or you don't know it. And this idea of making this proof non interactive, and how do you make it non interactive? There's this famous idea in cryptography known as the Fiat Shamir heuristic. And instead of me sending you a list or randomly asking you to do stuff for me, I use hash functions, or hashes of merkle roots that, like, you can actually use the environment around you to get a source of randomness without having to talk to me. And it makes you don't, we don't have to communicate with each other. I can just talk to you once and you can go and do your own thing, and you can prove to me that you in fact do know this thing and we don't have to talk to each other. It's not interactive. But that's sort of, that's sort of the idea.
01:08:34.040 - 01:09:12.759, Speaker A: And the reason, the reason we got into all of this was because I wanted to demonstrate they had nothing to do with blockchains. It could be interesting for blockchains, but it could be interesting for a lot of other things, including suppose somebody had to do a very sophisticated calculation using like a cluster of supercomputers that nobody else in the world has access to, that it's practically impossible for anyone to even verify that you were even like being truthful, or these, not just truthful, but these calculations were done correctly. And one way to do it is using a validity proof. You say, here is the list of outputs that you asked for me, and you paid me money for, you know, for the CPU hours or whatever, for, you know, for me to do this work for you. And here is a small proof that I did this correctly. And you don't have to trust the operator. You can trust the integrity of the mats.
01:09:12.759 - 01:09:14.779, Speaker A: And that is the great paradigm.
01:09:15.079 - 01:09:49.906, Speaker B: And a lot of this, I mean, as you said, is kind of only, I mean, really kind of got turbo charged by blockchains to just because there's so much money in the blockchain ecosystem. A lot more money has kind of been thrown at advancing this research and bringing it back to the front to use blockchain or to help scale blockchains. But it's definitely interesting how it's progressed over the last ten years or so.
01:09:50.018 - 01:10:57.350, Speaker A: Well, in many ways it was the question how do I behave in a byzantine system and how do I guarantee consensus in a byzantine south system? That means that it is possible for us to like, behave, but it's also possible for us to lie to each other in a certain setting. And it turns out that, like trying to build like a truly byzantine fault tolerance system is very computationally intensive. And like, if you try and do it any, anywhere outside the lab or we're talking about like a few thousands of users, 10,000 users with like tens of validators, it just, it's prohibitive. So there has to be a way for me to like decouple like trust and verification and move a lot of this off chain while maintaining sort of fault tolerance. And that's like, that's the, that's literally the purview of cryptography. It allows you to do things without revealing certain information, or it allows you to trust maths as opposed to trusting people. So, like, I think the end game is trust, but it's not trusting the operator, it's not trusting the agent, it's not trusting the game theoretic incentives, it's trusting the maths for sure.
01:10:58.370 - 01:11:13.030, Speaker B: Out of all of that, like the unique properties of validity proofs and zero knowledge proofs, what are you most excited at for in the application of blockchains?
01:11:16.130 - 01:12:09.556, Speaker A: I think besides the l two space that we talked about, which is in many ways uniquely enabled buy validity proofs. This idea that has come up recently of like applications, application specific chains, this idea that you can run one chain that is optimized to do one thing, let's say trading assets or minting nfts or playing a game or whatever, we know from general purpose competing, that in general having a very specific environment, that it's optimized to do one thing and one thing only is more performant and is cheaper than having like a general purpose system. So is there a way using these validity proofs to like scale fractally? And I know you don't like that word, but this idea of fractal scaling, this idea that like I can have a general all purpose base layer, let's call that start now. Let's call that the L2. And I can actually build application specific chains on it.
01:12:09.708 - 01:12:10.644, Speaker B: So layer three.
01:12:10.692 - 01:12:13.640, Speaker A: Layer three. You said it, not me. You said it, not me.
01:12:15.150 - 01:12:22.910, Speaker B: Let's get into layer threes. What are your thoughts, pros and cons and why you think they're interesting?
01:12:22.990 - 01:12:54.000, Speaker A: Okay, so let's first define a L2 from the, from the perspective of like the operators you have, you have in any validity proof system. You have essentially two agents, the verifier and the prover. So the verifier contract always exists on the base layer. It exists on, let's say ethereum. The prover exists off chain. The idea is that the prover sends the proof on chain, submits it on chain. It is executed in a way that's exponentially cheaper than it is to generate the proof.
01:12:54.000 - 01:14:00.300, Speaker A: That's the purpose of these succinct systems and binary, yes, no, this state transition is either true or if it's false, it never makes its way on chain. Literally by virtue of submitting that request chain, it must mean that it's true, assuming that the implementation is not correct. Now what if I tell you that, okay, let's move the verifier contract to L2. Let's, instead of having the verifier contract on layer one, let's actually post it on L2 and have the verifications done on L2. Is it possible to like recursively submit these proofs? So now I have this idea of a recursive proof, a proof that submitted from the l three to the l two, that's then another proof is generated for that combination and then that's submitted to the l one. And you're going to ask, well, what's the point of that? Or what's the benefit and what's the drawback? Well, the benefit of that is you can literally magnify like these types of like scaling, you can actually compress. If the transition from L2 to layer one gives you a thousand x compression and literally in terms of size, and then a layer three to L2 gives you another thousand x, you can actually compress like what you were doing at the layer three down to layer one by a factor of a million, which is extraordinary.
01:14:00.300 - 01:14:29.444, Speaker A: And you're limited only by reason. You could literally do this recursively. There's no, it's actually not like there's no hardware requirements. You can, the cost of generating these proofs, at least in the stark framework, is actually only like roughly logarithmic in terms of like, the size of the proof, which actually means you can make the proof a lot larger without having to incur that much cost. So it's actually not even a hardware problem. Remember, I had a discussion with someone who, they were asserting that you run into limitations that way. You actually don't.
01:14:29.444 - 01:15:00.196, Speaker A: It scales very, very well. You can do a layer three or four layer ten if you wanted to, it would not cost that much more. That's the beauty of, like algorithmic functions. But you're limited by common sense, and that is at some point you get enough. If you've reduced it, if you've reduced the gas cost from a few dollars per transaction to one 1,000,000th of a dollar per transaction, at some point you're like, okay, it's probably not worth the opportunity cost to like, essentially build an extra n plus one layer, right? At some point it's good enough. It's good enough. So that's really where it stops.
01:15:00.196 - 01:15:51.840, Speaker A: And the one argument, and that actually holds true also for optimistic systems as well, is how do you get cross roll up or cross l three or cross l two? Interoperability, right? You have this, these sort of silo chains, and they, each of them does something, and some of them might store their data, some of them might not store their data. I need them to interact with each other. And this is annoying to do because they're not all on, they're not essentially, they're not sharing the same state because at least the same temporary state. And my answer to that is, well, and hence recursive, like recursive groups, hence moving to a layer three and not a L2, because all of a sudden you now have to remember all, all the L2s. They talk to each other, they bridge through the l one. So what if I say, well, they bridge each other through the l two s. It's actually much faster and much cheaper as well.
01:15:51.840 - 01:16:13.330, Speaker A: So there is a method to the madness. It's not just, let's try and see what happens. If you design them in such a way where you can have certain guarantees and for certain applications, maybe you're not so interested in data availability. Maybe not everything has to be posted on chain. There is a world in which these things are actually very very composable by having, using these recursion proofs.
01:16:14.110 - 01:17:21.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean it makes sense to me like in theory, and I get like the data compression and like reducing gas costs, my like biggest thing. And I think we've kind of seen it like, yeah, on at least from the l one standpoint, there's just not very many users yet. I mean I think that's a variety of factors, but I think just how people have kind of become accustomed to like the web two type experience, we need to make it as cheap and as fast as possible. And so my only qualm today with like l three s or like even l two s for some standpoint is like what is the latency introduced when you keep doing these data compressions and then ultimately the latency. But when is the transaction actually final? Final. And I think because a lot of this, once we start adding all these different complexities, we're throwing it on the users and the users don't understand any of it. So I'm just curious over the long term to see how it will unfold.
01:17:21.300 - 01:17:26.970, Speaker B: But yeah, I don't know. I am curious.
01:17:27.090 - 01:17:46.630, Speaker A: Well, to answer one question that's very easy to answer. When is a transaction final? When it, when it makes it to the l one. And even then it might not be final, depending on the type of consensus that you have. But let's say, let's say you assume like you know, one block, once it makes it into the chain, that's it, sort of how avalanche does it final. Once it makes it there, that's fine. Beyond that, it's still not final. It's still a proposed block.
01:17:46.630 - 01:18:13.940, Speaker A: You're a fan of parallelization. And it, you know, and we know a chain which not, which will not be named, which is wonderful, that uses that as like the native primitive, the native ideas to paralyze a lot of the executions. The longest, like the state is not shared or it's not. There's no sort of overlap. You can execute things in parallel. So can you with these, with these l three. So can you with these provers.
01:18:13.940 - 01:18:55.000, Speaker A: Suppose instead of using, I mean that's how like Cairo works or stock networks today, they have a sharp or a shared prover. There's one prover that everybody can submit transactions to for multiple applications. And it sort of goes together, generates proof. But you can have multiple sharps and you can also have like dedicated provers that all execute or all produce these proofs for different l three s in parallel. You don't actually have to wait. And then they can be aggregated on an l two, for example, and be submitted once at some frequency to the. So you can actually get parallel like behavior using these, like, recursive starks or these recursive proofs.
01:18:55.000 - 01:19:06.400, Speaker A: So in many ways, like, I don't think latency will be a problem at the l two, l three level. And we've just, we're literally just scratching the surface on the hardware for provers.
01:19:06.480 - 01:19:07.140, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:19:07.480 - 01:19:34.616, Speaker A: Whether it's ASIC style FPGA's, we've literally not even, like, scratched the surface. And I have, I have no doubt in the same way that ten years ago, the. In the same way that we have Moore's law for general computation and for general, you know, the number of transistors on a diode and whatnot, the same, the same will be true for progress. And so I think we, we, it's really just a matter of time and latency will not be the issue for these, for these types of systems.
01:19:34.808 - 01:20:13.910, Speaker B: Makes sense. Yeah, I'm curious to kind of see how it plays over long term, maybe to kind of stick on this scaling topic. The industry today has kind of started to move towards more modular architecture versus, say, like monolithic, of like, bitcoin or ethereum. How do you kind of see these two kind of playing out over the long term? Or what do you think is, like, more optimal architecture for these blockchains?
01:20:15.530 - 01:21:10.572, Speaker A: So this one's a bit more nuanced. And also part of it is I have not, like, I have not studied every single possible combination like a modular blockchain versus, like, a monolithic blockchain. Because, to give you, like, a fair answer, because there are combinations of modular blockchains that might work better than certain monolithic blockchains. But just to say all modular blockchains will be superior to monolithic blockchains is nonsense. And the same is true the other way around. I do have one qualm, however, with this general idea of modularity, that everything could be separated out. You can separate out settlement, execution, data availability, whatever, if you assume that there is a scenario in which data is not available or like, that is violated somehow because of a dishonest majority, that doesn't just threaten the data availability layer, that actually threatens the consensus layer, that threatens the actual blockchain.
01:21:10.572 - 01:22:06.480, Speaker A: So there's a lot that goes out of the window if we start assuming that we're designing for a world in which we need everything to be modular in many ways, we're designing for a world that doesn't exist. We're designing for a world in which consensus on the l one is subverted and we have to resort to some sort of like, recourse with data availability. So I just don't think that, I don't think we've, there's enough thought that went into what the Venn diagram of assumptions are with like a monolithic l one and like a module l one. And what happens when, as soon as I start to detach these different functions from an l one and have them become modular. The second I start worrying about when these are like, for example, when data is available, the second I start to have generic proofs that I really, this is like the least of my worries. I should really be worrying about, well, what happens to my consensus. So in many ways, I think that it will be the dominant paradigm.
01:22:06.480 - 01:23:05.820, Speaker A: I am again of the opinion that trying to optimize as much as possible on the monolithic serial, even l one, before worrying about, like trying to optimize either using parallelization or either using modularity, there's a lot that could be done on the l one. And what we don't think about, we think about the outputs or the gain that we're going to get from introducing a modular architecture, but we don't think about is the sheer enormity of the task that has to go through that we have to take care of latency, that we have to make sure that, like, no security violations occur, that we have to make sure that all these systems communicate together. Like, there's a lot that goes in from a practical perspective, and in many ways, then I'll resort back to what I said about like proof of stake and optimistic system and proof of stake systems in general. Like, in theory, I think it might be a great idea, but in practice I might. I think there's a lot more that we're going to worry about if these, if these assumptions are violated when it comes to modularity.
01:23:05.900 - 01:23:28.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree. I think it's an interesting point of view to attack, but I am curious. And all these blockchains, I think they'll all work. It's just to what degree and what problem are they actually solving? And then from an engineering and user standpoint, which one works the best?
01:23:29.820 - 01:23:58.898, Speaker A: And there are a lot of ways to hand. Like, data is not an issue we have. Like, storing data somewhere is not the problem that we run into. Like today, the throughput bottlenecks is the paradigm that we're trying to solve and how to do, like, distributed consensus and decentralized computation. General, in a way that's very cheap. It is not. Where do we store this data? There are ways to store the data and there are ways to do it securely, and there are ways to incentivize people to do it.
01:23:58.898 - 01:24:09.160, Speaker A: It's not a big deal. And there are ways to optimize, like I said, to optimize DL1 and to optimize the monolithic layer. Well, before we even worry about.
01:24:09.500 - 01:24:40.088, Speaker B: Well, before we even worry about, like, modularity. Yeah, that's where I was kind of going. I fully agree. Like, we haven't even really explored the limits of a modular l one and how far we can have a monolithic l one and how far we can push that before even trying to do these different things, like sharding or whatever, different scaling solutions. And so I appreciate that some blockchains are taking the approach to do that and see how hard you can actually push that before trying these different avenues.
01:24:40.184 - 01:24:40.600, Speaker A: That's right.
01:24:40.640 - 01:25:06.190, Speaker B: That's right. Awesome, man. Well, maybe, like, I'm curious, we've been chatting for a while, about an hour and a half. I'm curious, though, maybe before we sign off, what are kind of like any spicy takes or things that you would say are contentious in the space that you hold near and dear to your heart?
01:25:06.930 - 01:25:10.562, Speaker A: Things that. Things that are spicy. I have a lot of spicy steaks.
01:25:10.586 - 01:25:14.670, Speaker B: I mean, let's hear them do a spicy data dump.
01:25:17.460 - 01:25:36.532, Speaker A: If you look at Defi today, the majority of primitives on there, the financial primitives that were built, are objectively inferior to what we have in, like, traditional finance. Like, you wouldn't if you were at a bank or if you were at a trading firm. You would never touch this stuff. It is so inferior, it's not even worth your time. It is laughable to some of these people. It is. It is.
01:25:36.532 - 01:25:40.356, Speaker A: And we've not even crossed that. Like jasmine, we're not even close.
01:25:40.468 - 01:25:47.418, Speaker B: Is that because of the underlying l one or just the apple? The actual application that is being built is just inferior?
01:25:47.474 - 01:26:04.706, Speaker A: I think both. I think the underlying l one is not performance. And the perimeters that are built on there, they're replicas. They're inferior digital replicas of what we already have. Right. And you see a lot of this in the space, and it's, you don't want to be like a party, but you don't want to. Just everything you see, like, oh, this sucks.
01:26:04.706 - 01:26:43.320, Speaker A: Oh, we have something better. But you just have to be critical and you have to be objective and you have to be like, listen, if the whole point of his whole premise is to, like, revolutionize the way we transact with each other and, like, change the way markets are structured and change the way people, like, send money to each other. We have to do better from a technological perspective and from a theoretical perspective as well. You can't come to me and say, hey, I want, you know, I'm proposing this money market or proposing this, like, Dex or whatever, and it's using, like, you know, rudimentary mathematics that, like, in many ways is, like, structurally flawed and that it's subject to, like, in a very clear ways. You can front run the stuff. Very clear adverse selection. You can toxic flow trade against these things.
01:26:43.320 - 01:27:07.606, Speaker A: You don't need to build these systems to recognize these things. But there's also been very good work describing why some of these systems may or may not work. Shout out to the guys at gauntlet who do wonderful research. They've shown what the limits of these systems are. And with the edge cases, actually, that these systems might be useful for. But I think that's where we are today. We are at the point of edge cases.
01:27:07.606 - 01:27:31.368, Speaker A: We may have a .2 or three points of potential. We say, hey, maybe this, in five or ten years, maybe this becomes better. But the majority of what we've built or what has been built today is useless. And it's not useless in the sense that we didn't learn anything from it, but we can't use it as a primitive. We literally cannot use it. And the other side of that coin or token is the tokenomics.
01:27:31.368 - 01:28:27.792, Speaker A: Okay, we've had the era of central banking started in about 1910s, is when we've had, like, the modern form of the central bank. And we've spent about 100 years, maybe 110 years, people trying to figure out monetary economics. And we've thrown the finest economic minds, if there are such a thing, I'm kidding, at these problems. And we've yet to come with, like, simple models for how to model the economy, the behavior of agents in the economy, and how to, like, develop ex ante system that by monetary expansion and monetary contraction, we can, like, incentivize people to behave in a certain way and maintain stable unemployment and stable price levels, which is sort of like the mandate of the Federal Reserve, at least, which is sort of the de facto central of the United States. We've not gotten there yet. So to expect people that are like, casually producing these, like, tokenomic systems to get this right is absurd.
01:28:27.856 - 01:28:29.184, Speaker B: It's completely absurd.
01:28:29.312 - 01:29:14.094, Speaker A: And to say that, like, oh, but you know, we have these tokens and they do this our tokens do very little. The tokens that we have today are, we haven't even lived like one cycle of tokenomics. Most of these tokens, like, let's say they vest over the. Or the emissions occurs either at infinitum or five, six, seven years when the majority of supply comes on. We haven't even gone through that cycle yet. So I think besides the financial primitives, the tokenomics that the tokenomic models that we have today are completely and utterly absurd and need to be like, chained from first principles. And the fact that today you can't even point that you have to ask people, tell me one example of like a tokenomic system that you do like as opposed to one that you don't like.
01:29:14.094 - 01:30:15.764, Speaker A: The majority of them don't work, and the ones that work don't behave in the way as we're designed and we're not even sure they might work. Now, I mean, in many cases, if you look at like, I don't want to, I don't want to like throw dirt, but if you look at like some of these games that had, you know, people were pointing to these as, you know, miraculous tokenomic systems that, you know, are going to change the future of France, these, these tokenomic systems, and lo and behold, six months later, right? Shambolic, shambolic. So it's the same thing. We haven't even tried out these tokenomic systems and we haven't given them enough thought. And surely the most interesting thing in web3, in addition to the fact that we can have these decentralized primitives, is the fact that we can use a token incentive, in addition to the normal economic incentive of any enterprise to incentivize users to behave in a way they would otherwise not be. We have yet to even scratch the surface on that. And so I think people that attest to like, you know, tokenomics and people talk about like, Defi primitives and Defi because I think it's the most mature one.
01:30:15.764 - 01:30:20.884, Speaker A: I think we are nowhere near. So my, those are maybe, maybe spicy takes, I guess.
01:30:20.972 - 01:30:21.348, Speaker B: I like it.
01:30:21.364 - 01:30:21.828, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:30:21.924 - 01:30:36.504, Speaker B: Well, really appreciate your time and I'm sure a lot of people are going to enjoy this podcast, but no, thank you. And super happy we met in New York, and happy to call you a friend. Yeah, thank you.
01:30:36.552 - 01:30:55.388, Speaker A: The pleasure and distinction is all mine. Thank you. Thank you for spending time with me. Thank you for this beautiful, beautiful day, beautiful podcast. Shout out to Dean. Where is Dean? He's not here, but maybe our friend Dean Krauss, who is very kind enough to host us here. He was supposed to.
01:30:55.388 - 01:30:56.708, Speaker A: You're supposed to come on just to.
01:30:56.724 - 01:30:58.044, Speaker B: Say hi, make a quick cameo.
01:30:58.092 - 01:30:58.884, Speaker A: Make a quick cameo.
01:30:58.932 - 01:31:05.348, Speaker B: But he'll get his own podcast, so you can show up and get some limelight.
01:31:05.444 - 01:31:17.980, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll find him. Yeah. So again, thank you. Thank you for your intellectual prowess. Thank you for, like, keeping me intellectually honest. Like, sometimes I say things like, eh, that doesn't make any sense. Explain it to me more.
01:31:17.980 - 01:31:21.444, Speaker A: I might be wrong, but, yeah, likewise. It's my pleasure.
01:31:21.492 - 01:31:22.484, Speaker B: Thank you, Omar.
01:31:22.652 - 01:31:23.060, Speaker A: Thank you.
