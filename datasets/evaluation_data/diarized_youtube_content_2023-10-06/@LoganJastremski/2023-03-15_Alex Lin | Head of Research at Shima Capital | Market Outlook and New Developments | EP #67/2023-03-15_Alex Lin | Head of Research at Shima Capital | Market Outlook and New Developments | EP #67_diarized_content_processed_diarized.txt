00:00:00.360 - 00:00:30.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I couldn't be more bullish, honestly. If I didn't look at the prices, if I didn't look at our market cap, I would say, you know, we're back in 2020, we're back in early 2022. It was really phenomenal. And I think, you know, several trends like zero knowledge, it's a super, super hot topic. Everything from privacy to scaling to a number of really unique use cases, discourse around infrastructure. The EVM, in my opinion, focuses a lot on infra, less so on application layer protocols, and I think that that was kind of visible and present. That said, there was this course on account abstraction, wallets on ramps, whatnot.
00:00:30.820 - 00:00:54.460, Speaker A: I think it was just a good preface, in my opinion, to what's to come. I think all of these protocols have really robust roadmaps that they're trying to fulfill over the next few years. And I think it's just really exciting. But it was a good reminder that, you know, things are still early. Early can kind of mean different things, but I would say maybe immature and there's a long way to go, but super promising with respect to the types of people that are building these protocols, as well as kind of what they're envisioning.
00:00:58.550 - 00:01:10.370, Speaker B: Well, I'm super excited today to be joined by Alex from Shima Capital, who leads their head of research. Alex and I have been chatting a little bit and I think this is going to be a great conversation.
00:01:11.630 - 00:01:15.970, Speaker A: Awesome, everyone. Thanks Logan, for having me. Super excited to be here.
00:01:16.670 - 00:01:17.262, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:01:17.366 - 00:01:22.890, Speaker A: Obviously been a huge fan and viewer of the pod, so good to be on the other side.
00:01:23.450 - 00:01:39.950, Speaker B: I appreciate the kind words. Well, I would love to start a little bit about your background. I always try to start the podcast with a little bit of context on who you are, how you got involved in the crypto world. So if you could give a quick spiel, that'd be great to kick it off.
00:01:40.410 - 00:03:01.886, Speaker A: Sure. So I guess kind of starting from the beginning with undergrad, I studied applied math, computer science and economics at the Virginia Military Institute. I didn't end up commissioning for a number of reasons, which I'll explain in a moment, but through my work, I had a professor who first introduced me to cryptography and a number of just base crypto systems in my degree. And I remember thinking to myself, this stuff's really cool. It was ranging from Grosvenor basis concepts to obviously, the different encryption themes that we now see today. And so I was kind of along the educational path of picking up what's going on within the space, but indirectly, I actually also was super into Runescape growing up and I had sold a few accounts and was running a bot farm in college to people around the world. And I had a few buyers of my accounts and I played legitimately.
00:03:01.886 - 00:03:37.216, Speaker A: I wasn't just a bot, but I had a few buyers that purchased my accounts using bitcoin for a number of reasons. They didn't want to use PayPal or they couldn't access PayPal. I remember it was very degenerate back then. It was using, I guess degenerate in the word that we use today, in the sense that I was using encrypted emails to communicate. I was experiencing pseudonymity pretty early on. I was receiving bitcoin, and bitcoin I think was $20 at the time. So that was my first foray into the space.
00:03:37.216 - 00:04:24.226, Speaker A: Didn't really think much of it, read the white paper and was kind of connecting the dots with the schoolwork that I had. Fast forward to 2014. So this was back in 2012. Fast forward to 2014. I was an intern at Dell and Dell had just started a partnership with Coinbase Commerce that summer when I was an intern, and they essentially were accepting bitcoin for the purchase of their products. Monitor computers, mouse, etcetera. And I remember thinking, oh, I have some of this stuff, or what remained from the Mount Goxact and I'll just use this to purchase some items.
00:04:24.226 - 00:04:35.520, Speaker A: And this is kind of a sign that things are going mainstream in my mind. It wasn't as bad as the crypto or the bitcoin pizza purchase, but still hurts if I calculate it out today.
00:04:36.380 - 00:04:37.120, Speaker B: Sure.
00:04:38.060 - 00:04:55.906, Speaker A: That's the second part of my. Wow, things are getting more serious. Time to dig a bit deeper then. I have these different phases of my life. I ended up going into consulting right after undergrad. I didn't go into the space full time or anything. At Deloitte.
00:04:55.906 - 00:06:05.982, Speaker A: When I was in s and O strategy and operations, I tried to join the blockchain group in SF. It was more so private blockchains at the time. I think a lot of the big four consulting auditing firms were addressing the hyperledgers of the world, trying to figure out what private blockchains and what they were and how could it change supply chain, for instance, and obviously IBM leading that kind of initiative. And then I ended up getting rejected from that opportunity just for a number of bureaucratic reasons, large consulting firm stuff, and then essentially removed myself from corporate opportunities with respect to blockchain, but kind of kept up with it over the years, 2017, 2018, so on and so forth, until finally in 2020. Summer I guess defi summer a number of other things kind of told me, hey, you should probably consider getting into this full time. During that time span I was an engineer, PM and founder at several web two companies. I worked at Teeds ad Tech which was acquired in 2017 and then an enterprise SaaS company called Concertiv, which was majority acquired in 2020 by long art capital PE firm.
00:06:05.982 - 00:07:12.190, Speaker A: And then I decided to go back to grad school to focus specifically within crypto and studied computer engineering and got a technical MBA from Cornell where strategically it was twofold. I wanted to get into crypto full time and I wanted to become an investor after being an operator for many years and really I started tweeting. I think a lot of people realized how the power of crypto Twitter at the time during the bull market started tweeting, got the attention of a team called old fashioned research OfR, which is the former binance executive team at that helped bring in Axie Infinity FTX, a number of other companies through Binance labs. They started a fund after they left Binance and joined them as a venture partner, did a number of deals for them and through that met the current GP of Shima Capital Ita at Art Basel in 2021. So like peak post, above $3 trillion market cap, good days of crypto and essentially joined the.
00:07:13.080 - 00:07:14.336, Speaker B: It was a wild time.
00:07:14.488 - 00:07:24.380, Speaker A: Wild. Yeah. Remember or not remember, you know, and yeah, join Shima as I finished up my last semester in grad school and this is now 2022.
00:07:25.080 - 00:07:43.704, Speaker B: Amazing. And maybe just give like a quick overcap and then of Shima and then dive into I know you recently went to eat Denver, if you could kind of recap kind of that, but if you could share a little bit more about the firm and your high level thesis.
00:07:43.872 - 00:08:41.878, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So Shima Capital is an early stage, so pre seed seed venture fund focused exclusively within the blockchain web3 realm of investments and we raised about $200 million mid last year. Pretty sizable for early stage, but I think the way that we think about it is we're really trying to build out a full stack firm that offers a number of different, I guess, support for our portfolio companies beyond the investment. I think as an investor you're aware capital is abundant even in the bear market. Record number of capital was raised by firms to invest in the space. And so you really have to differentiate yourself in a number of ways. The way that we thought about it was we're going to focus on four core areas beyond the capital, which is marketing.
00:08:41.878 - 00:09:24.480, Speaker A: So really focusing on amplifying the narratives of our portfolio companies, we have a talent team to help recruit. I would say, beyond monetary capital, the most important capital is humans, human capital and what they bring to the space. And so helping our portfolio companies hire the right people. We do a lot of business development work, everything from table stakes of introductions in business development to strategic partnerships, to just ensuring that our portfolio companies meet and get access to the right entities. And then lastly, technical advisory. So we have a very technical operator driven team. I mentioned my background.
00:09:24.480 - 00:09:29.650, Speaker A: A number of other investors on the team have previous operating experience, and.
00:09:31.670 - 00:09:32.006, Speaker B: We.
00:09:32.038 - 00:10:02.460, Speaker A: Provide a number of services from technical advisory of architecture design, token design, product development to help get our projects from zero to one. We focus on a number of areas where generalists fund within the space. So defi, infrastructure, middleware to gaming, very heavy on gaming, nfts, metaverse, so on and so forth. And kind of everything in between. And that also kind of goes to the tech stack, right? So application layer, protocols, all the way down to network layer.
00:10:03.240 - 00:10:21.500, Speaker B: Well, definitely get into some of those specific themes. But as a participant in the recent events at ETH Denver, I love for you to kind of like recap some of the big themes that you saw while attending ETH Denver and kind of overall market sentiment.
00:10:23.200 - 00:11:17.690, Speaker A: Yeah, it was incredible the amount of people that came out. I think the record number kind of ranged between 25,000 to 35,000 people. I arrived a few days earlier than from the main event because there are a lot of side events, from hacker houses to the interop summit, which was sponsored by Axelr. That was an incredible two day event focused on cross chain interoperability. And then there was Walletcon, which is a one day event. So there are a lot of tertiary events in addition to the main event, which I think really boosted the attendance and really boosted just general overall positive sentiment across all of the different side events. Builders were building a really good discourse among founders across the different protocols and organizations within each vertical.
00:11:17.690 - 00:12:19.340, Speaker A: And yeah, I couldn't be more bullish, honestly, if I didn't look at the prices, if I didn't look at our market cap, I would say we're back in 2020, we're back in, or I guess 2021, 2022, early 2022. And so it was really phenomenal. And I think several trends are kind of being rotated. Maybe a bit too much or discussed too much is like zero knowledge, just a super, super hot topic. Everything from privacy to scaling to a number of really unique use cases, which I think we'll touch on a little bit later. A lot of discussions and discourse around infrastructure I think that the EVM, in my opinion, focuses a lot on infrared, less so on application layer protocols, and I think that that was kind of visible and present. That said, there was discourse on account abstraction, wallets on ramps, whatnot.
00:12:19.340 - 00:12:43.260, Speaker A: So I think it was a very, I would say, comprehensive and well rounded ETH Denver. So everything was pretty much touched on. But I would, if I had to, like, I guess, extract a few things, a big focus on interoperability, big focus on use cases from Web 2.5, on ramping wallet access perspective, and then zero knowledge.
00:12:43.720 - 00:13:01.380, Speaker B: Nice. Maybe if we could just touch upon those three. Then on the interoperability side, what were some of your biggest takeaways from the conference and just what people were specifically excited about from the interoperability point of view?
00:13:02.730 - 00:14:30.250, Speaker A: Yeah, so interoperability is a very catch all term, as is with, I guess, cks and a number of other themes. I would say there's a lot of attention with respect to EVM, unlike the Shanghai update coming up and the shared security around that, what it means for liquid staking protocols like Eigen layer and Babylon chain with leveraging staked assets to improve the security of other middleware infrastructure protocols. I think that that was a very common theme, and I think that that's really exciting, but also just realizing how early it is, if we just think about interoperability cross chain at its core idea of bridging different protocols, layer one protocols, L2s as well, layer zero XLR or blabs hyperlane. So a number of these different solutions are still pretty much, in my opinion, in its infancy, and you can categorize them in its infancy in different areas, from the scalability to the security to really what can be built on top of these messaging protocols. And so I think it was just a good preface, in my opinion, to what's to come. I think all of these protocols have really robust roadmaps that they're trying to fulfill over the next few years. And I think it's just really exciting.
00:14:30.250 - 00:14:46.790, Speaker A: But it was a good reminder that things are still early. Early can mean different things, but I would say maybe immature, and there's a long way to go, but super promising with respect to the types of people that are building these protocols as well as what they're envisioning.
00:14:47.610 - 00:14:57.760, Speaker B: And then is this particularly interoperability between, like the middle layers or between L2s or all of the above?
00:14:58.620 - 00:15:48.238, Speaker A: I would say all of the above. I think IBC is probably one of the most mature, I guess, examples of interoperability within the cosmos ecosystem and they just had like an update, I think yesterday or two days ago. With respect to interchain querying, I would say all of the above. But I think a lot of attention is around just taking staked assets from one chain to another. And it has been less so. Like Babylon chain for instance, taking stake bitcoin and leveraging that to enhance the security on Cosmos or EVM Eigen layer to enhance security within EVM, so on and so forth. So there's that aspect.
00:15:48.238 - 00:16:16.050, Speaker A: But then you have your typical Axelr or layer zero, the applications being built on top, for instance like Acedra finance, who's building out a lending borrowing protocol that's like native. So you're not using any wrapped assets unlike say for instance Aave's portal. So it's kind of like these are all developments that are happening. And I would say it could mean across layer ones, it could mean across L2s, it could mean a crosse or within an ecosystem like cosmos.
00:16:17.510 - 00:16:43.280, Speaker B: Very interesting. And then on the L2 front, I mean within like zero knowledge, obviously being a hot topic, was there a main kind of focus? Because layers or zero knowledge can also be kind of a all encompassing term. Was it more focused on privacy or strictly kind of viewed through the lens of scalability? How were people thinking about it?
00:16:44.020 - 00:17:43.390, Speaker A: Yeah, so I saw an interesting dichotomy occurring between attendees and builders. A lot of the builders were looking at and leveraging zero knowledge for use cases more focused on the application layer side. So I met some great founders, or, excuse me, builders at like the one KX to Lindem hacker House, that was focused on building a ZK walleth. Also there was a project building out like a ZK oracle that enhances real world assets bridging on chain, which would enable a lot of applications to be built on top of that. Whereas a lot of the discourse at ZK day, for instance, and the discussions I had with people walking around, it was very much around scaling very much around privacy and the consistent themes that we've seen with ZK over the last few years. So I think that bifurcation is starting to happen, which I think is very healthy. Right.
00:17:43.390 - 00:18:06.410, Speaker A: Because on the builder side, we need more application layer protocols. And I think from a scaling perspective, there are a number of advancements that really need to be battle tested by applications. And so I'm very bullish on kind of the headspace that builders are kind of going through with respect to focusing more on applications when it comes to ZK use cases.
00:18:07.260 - 00:18:28.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we'll probably maybe dive a little bit more into L2s down the line. But on the last note that you kind of touch upon as the main theme was the wallet space and account abstraction, how do you feel like that is going to shift the momentum in the ethereum ecosystem?
00:18:31.540 - 00:19:57.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's such an important topic that honestly, even with more attention being put on it, it's still not enough, in my opinion. And I believe there was an account of traction update that happened during the week. I haven't even been able to catch up on it. I remember seeing a tweet that was highlighting account of traction happened and no one's talking about it because everyone's at East Denver or whatever, but I've always had kind of a problem with how we've addressed wallets and how we've addressed on ramps. I think it was a necessary evil to kind of get to the point that we are today. But I've been pretty vocal about, for instance, on the EOA side, how metamask, like, the best thing that could probably happen to the space is if Metamask were acquired I by like a more product, more first principle product company, like an Apple, for instance. And people are like, wait, what? Yeah, but you know, I think before the podcast we were talking about, this distribution is something that Metamask was able to achieve, something that no other wallet to this day even, you know, wallets that have exceptional user experience and user flows, such as Phantom backpack, et cetera, on sale on the Solana side that they just haven't been able to reach.
00:19:57.240 - 00:21:01.120, Speaker A: I think 10 million plus 11 million maus on metamask side, all that really needs to happen, and I'm obviously generalizing, but all that really needs to happen is this focus on ensuring that users are, have safety, have security, and have really good access to different application layer protocols that I think a lot of the work that has been done thus far has been ignoring. And so I think we're bringing up this MPC multisig kind of traction conversation because nothing has happened yet and we're kind of thinking of different ways that we can enhance that experience. But I would say the conversations at the conference reflect a lot of what I'm saying now, and hopefully very soon some of these things will be realized, but still in its infancy, and hopefully we can speed that process up a bit more.
00:21:01.660 - 00:21:44.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm definitely interested to see how it all plays out. I think the fact, I mean, the industry is getting mature, more mature, but I would still argue it's very, very early in terms of like user adoption and just general adoption on chain. So to that kind of point, I mean, ethereum ecosystem, I mean, at the moment, kind of undisputed as like the king of like, where things are happening. But how are you personally, like, thinking about other various ecosystems, whether it's layer ones or L2s and the scaling roadmap that some of these different ecosystems are taking?
00:21:47.300 - 00:23:16.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really hard to say. Right. We constantly ask, why does there need to be another L2? Why does there need to be another layer one? I think when it comes to just the actual development of these protocols and you kind of break down the stack, it makes sense, but it obviously comes at a cost for the end user and for our industry as a whole, but I think it is necessary. And so what do I mean by that? For me, I think that if you break down the stack, right, from consensus to the network protocol to the data availability, that you choose settlement, execution, all the different components, node, software, the client, there are incremental innovations happening at each part, and the combinatorics of those innovations exceed the number of protocols that we see today. In my mind, the upper bound is a significantly higher number of Alt L1 s and L two s, which I'm not saying that there should be, but it makes sense as to why people continue trying to build out more and more. And so, and then when you start tacking on community and you start tacking on kind of more of the non technical side of things, then you even have more. You have like, you know, a, I guess, larger design space.
00:23:16.260 - 00:24:27.460, Speaker A: Right, to work with. And so the current state of things, you know, I would say we obviously see our consistent players with Solana, Avalanche, EVM, of course, it's like Phantom making a comeback with Andre coming back, the arbitrum, optimism, ZK battles between, I guess, optimistic proofs and zks, in my mind, they're all just innovating at different parts of the stack, some more than others. And I think it'll continue to play out that way. I think that it's like the whole competition drives innovation, race, and I'm okay with that. And I'm glad that there is a lot of conflict and discourse on Twitter and media between all the different players, because it really kind of breeds a good thing for the industry at the end of the day. That said, I guess kind of digging a bit further and kind of double clicking on some of these areas. The question is, what is more important to focus on? So, for instance, parallel execution is very top of mind for a lot of these protocols.
00:24:27.460 - 00:25:33.364, Speaker A: Solana has done it quite well with sea level, but at the sacrifice of maybe some other issues that they've experienced and people like to call them out for the network and going down and whatever. But if we just focus on sea level, that innovation is quite important in kind of the overall competition and I guess, market landscape of what is possible, right? I would say that the idea of independent transactions, how to identify independent transactions is very difficult. And Solana, for instance, makes programs stateless, requires transactions to specify all state. And to read or write that during execution is like, is really incredible. And so that's why you see the record tps that they've achieved over the last few years. Swe, for instance, Mistin Labs. So they do it at the bytecode level through move smart contract language that is object oriented.
00:25:33.364 - 00:26:34.874, Speaker A: And so with that functionality and that kind of difference, then you have digital assets that are represented by the built in resource of that asset type and so on. EVM, for instance, each transaction operates on the global block state, but in suite, every transaction operates and provides reference to the actual objects itself instead of accounts. Any object that doesn't have the same input or output can be executed in parallel. I can keep going on fuel does it through utxos. Multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and any utxos that aren't aligned with a previous UtxO, then you can parallelize that, that relationship. So it's really fascinating to see all of these developments, and you're doing it in so many different ways. And that's just one thing.
00:26:34.874 - 00:26:39.950, Speaker A: Parallel execution versus everything else that I listed as a component to the stack.
00:26:40.330 - 00:27:19.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there, I mean, there's kind of these big innovations. I think that going from zero to one type of things, and I think going from single threaded virtual machines to parallel virtual machine was a pretty big jump on that front. I mean, you kind of listed off like various different ways of doing parallelization. In your point of view, is there one that has specific advantages that you think will, over time, as long as that community kind of gets built out, will kind of be the dominant kind of virtual machine? Strictly on like a technical side.
00:27:21.770 - 00:28:29.046, Speaker A: I think it's hard to say because a lot of the stuff that I mentioned isn't truly battle tested or proven out yet, in my opinion. And like I said, on the Solana side, it comes at a cost, maybe in other areas of their protocol, with proof of history not being able to. Once it gets bloated with transactions, it could go down and sweat. I think that. I think that Swe is really interesting, because I'm not too sure how they're versioning the different objects, for instance, and the different states within those objects to allow for that kind of execution. Monad, which is a recent investment that we made, they're improving upon the EVM and they're pretty quiet about it, like how they identify the transactions, and ensuring that transactions that don't need to be linear are pulled out and executed in parallel is kind of their innovation. It's all super.
00:28:29.046 - 00:29:25.370, Speaker A: Essentially, they're moving the bottleneck from one process to another part of the process, and at the end of the day, it could all end up performing the same. We don't know. And so that's another risk associated to this method. But I think that's a hard question to answer at this point in time. But I think there are advantages conceptually that we can see on the sui side, doing it at the smart contract language side, it allows for a lot more flexibility with the compiler and just being super low level, there's a lot more design space. I think there are limitations with hardware and latency of the actual blockchain that also affects what they can parallelize depending on, for instance, fuel doing it with UtxO. So yeah, I guess I could go on and on, but I think I'm giving you a non answer that it's too hard to tell.
00:29:26.110 - 00:30:28.690, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll definitely be interesting to see. I'm definitely, if anything, a parallelization. Maxi. I think it's super important to have parallel virtual machines, but on that front, I think industry is kind of bifurcating in some sense, where you have these large single state ecosystems where they're trying to keep everything a single shard, and then you have ecosystems like cosmos and avalanche, where they're trying to do application specific chains, or either migrating from an l one to an l two and having different l two s. How do you see in these different architectures from an infrastructure standpoint, are there any specific ecosystems and designs that you're leaning towards, or are you agnostic and just will follow the builders and wherever they choose to build?
00:30:29.130 - 00:31:46.900, Speaker A: Hmm. Yeah, I think that's, it's really interesting kind of the state that we're in, because as an investor and user, or I would say, okay, I think there are differences there. As a user, I shouldn't care. Right. I think we don't really, we don't really acknowledge the difference between SMTP when using email versus HTTP and using the Internet. And in the future, I don't think that there needs to be a distinction between the two or between many protocols. That said, on the investor side, I'm also looking and considering where does the value accrue to when it comes to the tokens that are involved with establishing consensus, the role it plays with generating fees and at the end of the day, revenue for these protocols to continue running? And then as a technologist and operator, the idea is how do those fees affect what I'm building and the costs associated with building? How does it affect my protocol that I'm building on top? And then the customizations.
00:31:46.900 - 00:32:48.794, Speaker A: So breaking down each of those, I guess I'll start from the end. I think the roll ups as a service opportunity from a technologist perspective is really, really cool. I think what most people don't understand, or maybe they do, but I think from my purview, what people have a hard time understanding and grasping, is the limitation isn't necessarily just block space, because if you wanted more block space as a Dap, let's just say I'm building a Defi Dapp and I just need more black space. Rollup as a servant isn't necessarily just like spinning one up, say with Caldera isn't necessarily my first option because I would probably go to a network with more block space. But then once you start incorporating a number of other features and factors such as community, where the liquidity is, and most importantly customizability, then it becomes a bit more attractive. But then some of these roll up as a services don't offer that. Customized customizations.
00:32:48.794 - 00:34:06.870, Speaker A: And what do I mean by customizations? I mean being able to pick different vms, being able to pick different data availability, being able to pick the different proofs that I want among the vms, and then different consensus, right? And so like Caldera Eclipse, there are a number of these protocols that have kind of sprung up and it's very advantageous for a builder. Like, I think it's fantastic. Now then, on the investor side, if we think about where does the value accrue? If these roll ups as a service offers a solution for these protocols, it still goes to the settlement layer at the end of the day because you're extracting value across the different stacks. Caldera is dependent on a celestial or I think they're using Eigen layer and then they're using fraud proofs and then they're settling on EVM. And it's like, I think Ethereum still gets most of that value accrual. I was looking at a project building a VM on Avalanche, same thing in Subnet, same thing with Cosmos. And so I think it's very important to consider that you need to have a very tightly coupled layer one network with the L2 if you want to go that route to ensure value accrual to the right people entities.
00:34:06.870 - 00:35:20.270, Speaker A: If you are building that network, then lastly, as a consumer, like I said, I don't think it really matters. I think when it does matter to me is how does the design space and what does the opportunity of the developers of what they're equipped with affect me as an end user, I think it makes a lot of sense to ensure that if developers are happy and building the right products, then the user experience and the users become happy. User and developer might have some parity there with respect to maybe roll ups as a service and what customizations enable you to have might be the better or bullish thing. But I think it's important to kind of find balance across all three entities that play a role in the space. And I think that it'll be really interesting to see rollups as a service kind of mature and how monolithic layer ones, the Swedes of the world, Solanas, et cetera, et cetera, address that and kind of deal with this kind of new customization. But like I said, we still don't know what part of those customizations, like if the DA improvement actually makes a difference, if something else fails.
00:35:21.130 - 00:36:18.928, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, a lot of that makes sense, I think. Yeah, I always say all these different design decisions will work, but from the user perspective and the engineering point of view, what is the most simplistic? And I think when you start to go down the different architectures, they really highlight in the real world some limitations that you just can't get around. So it definitely is a super, super interesting rabbit hole. Um, yeah, it's, it is, it is fascinating. Just all the different design decisions, I think. I mean, that, that one, I mean, the fact that we're still talking about it so kind of shows that we're still early and it's still kind of a pivotal role or role to play in the ecosystem. I think on that front though, there isn't, I mean, today we're not really constrained by block space.
00:36:18.928 - 00:36:57.440, Speaker B: Even on ethereum, like, block space is not being fully utilized. So it's not an issue of blockchain block space today. I think ultimately down the line, once we get adoption, it will be. But what in terms of applications do you think need to be built? Or, I mean, going back to what you're talking about initially with Shima and kind of your high level interests, what applications do you think could bring in that user adoption or take advantage of more block space that actually bring in kind of like some real world use cases into crypto outside of number go up.
00:36:58.100 - 00:37:04.476, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's the billion dollar question, billion people question, right?
00:37:04.588 - 00:37:05.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:06.820 - 00:38:01.090, Speaker A: We look at it in several different ways, and I consistently reference Nick Grossman's piece on infrastructure application relationship, and I had written about it in a blog post last year on how infrastructure is a means to an end, to really enable application layer protocols and drive consumer adoption. And what that really means, I think we are at the point where we have all of these incredible innovations happening at the infrastructure layer. We're just waiting on the right use cases. To me that really comes in several different forms. But I think top of mind is gaming. I think gaming is a very interesting kind of contentious point as well. Some people think gaming has no reason to be related to being on chain.
00:38:01.090 - 00:39:10.100, Speaker A: I mean, in its current state, most of gaming is just nfts, right, being on chain. And maybe you have some derivatives of its underlying asset being leveraged token on the axie, for instance, axie infinity to drive adoption and to drive user access. So we're still super, super immature there. But if you really think about the opportunity of, say, more assets, more types of games, more use cases of on chain gaming, and it doesn't have, it's a spectrum, it's not binary. I'm not saying first person shooters, every action needs to be on chain. But if you have super hyper casual mobile games where it might be turn based, for instance, that can technically go on chain, and the types of transactions that are being, or I guess the types of things that are being transacted at scale across all the different users playing a game can really take eat up that block space as we're talking about. So I would say gaming for sure, and some themes here.
00:39:10.100 - 00:40:18.022, Speaker A: So we have a gaming team, and so I'm really kind of quoting them on kind of the research and work that they've done. But on the gaming side, a lot of the innovations are around, or what we're excited about is mobile. I think that that'll continue to proliferate across multiple generations and multiple geographies, particularly Asia mobile, hyper casual. So like kind of lunch, like the games that you would play at lunch, turn based with either deep progression systems, right? So there's an incentive to continue going down the lore of the game, even if it's hyper casual, as well as having really strong ip. So intellectual properties related to the types of lore that is associated to the game and the assets as well. So if you think about how much of a role or how significant of an impact anime plays in our day to day lives, like anime is profoundly impactful when it comes to entertainment in media. And the ip associated to that really generates very strong retention among a user base.
00:40:18.022 - 00:40:42.960, Speaker A: Those are the types of games and the studios that we are looking to invest in into support, because I think that that has really strong optimized retention mechanics. And so across all of these different areas, if we can identify games that are looking to go on chain and leverage new primitives, blockchain rails, then yeah, I would say block space. It's going to be an issue finding more block space at that point.
00:40:44.100 - 00:42:13.752, Speaker B: I mean, the gaming category or industry as a whole, being built on blockchain rails is going to be really fascinating just how it ultimately prolificates. I think now, because the industry is so small, I mean, even looking at Uniswap and Opensea, they do a lot of volumes, but like their active addresses or like people that have ever interacted with those contracts is extremely small compared to web two standards. And if you have one popular game that has some cracked token incentives or on chain mechanics that could onboard the entirety of users and become the most popular Dapp overnight easily. So I think from that point, the gaming kind of similar to nfts and even highlighted in Electric capital's recent report, I think it was like 80 or 83% of all first time interactions on chain have been through nfts. So to onboard people into web3 and get them out of these safe havens of, or unsafe havens of these exchanges onto crypto rails, I am super fascinated by. From the investment standpoint though, I think games are a little bit tricky just in like theyre either complete winners or kind of slowly fizzle. I guess you could kind of say that same for startups though, so.
00:42:13.896 - 00:42:14.344, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:14.432 - 00:42:17.780, Speaker B: Maybe not too uh, too uh. Different.
00:42:19.520 - 00:43:20.962, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, yeah, I guess just to add on to that, it's um. I would treat it like any other investment opportunity. And there are, you know, it's, it's all about defining a thesis similar to what I just mentioned with the types of studios and the types of games that you really think and take off. I would say we've largely not necessarily ignored, but we've largely passed on a number of AAA games just due to the long build cycles and risk becoming more difficult to hedge against with the production of those types of games. And I think in a lot of people's minds, AAA games are still somewhat present given the last cycle, but I think we're slowly moving away from that. And your point on nfts is really fascinating. I would say the 2021 boom was predominantly due to nfts and because of the requirement that DeFi is tied to nfts, D five was the on ramp in a way to nfts.
00:43:20.962 - 00:43:46.980, Speaker A: Because how do you purchase your nfts if it wasn't wrapped in a. If it wasn't done through like a moonpay or something, but. Or these brands kind of allowing for credit card payments? But I think that that ebb and flow relationship will be extremely profound with games. And I think that that once again will be another unlock in the next cycle for sure.
00:43:47.560 - 00:43:50.980, Speaker B: I say we run it back with Runescape on chain.
00:43:51.600 - 00:43:58.570, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh man, I saw Runescape on chain like MVP at.
00:43:59.750 - 00:44:00.670, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:44:00.830 - 00:44:10.330, Speaker A: Yeah. Last few months ago. I should probably check on how they're doing. I mean, it was, it was very, it was very like lo Fi, but.
00:44:11.390 - 00:44:15.710, Speaker B: World of Warcraft, I'd be down to a rebuild either on chain.
00:44:15.870 - 00:45:09.738, Speaker A: Right, right. But, but yeah, I would definitely say the games. And then I think social, you know, for sure, and all the different derivatives of social, you know, obviously an onion that has many different layers that you can peel back. And I say social because it's one of those things that really aligns itself with decentralization and distributed networks quite well. And then also, you know, I think tech history gives us a really good example of how it could work out. I would say social media really pushed the envelope of innovation on the infrastructure side. Cloud compute and the AWS suite to GCP with Google and Azure, Snowflake, et cetera, really came about because of the amount of big data that was happening and the amount of big data that was being generated.
00:45:09.738 - 00:46:03.400, Speaker A: Because social media also drove advertising with the amount of big data occurring, a lot of these cloud compute companies, data companies needed to innovate and improve their infrastructure. Azure had a relational database called RDS. Early two thousands. They built out redshift and the entire AWS suite to adjust for those things. I think that's the catalyst that we need for web3 as well. And I think more generally, when you start factoring in all the different components of social, as I mentioned, with music, with nfts, with entertainment, sports, media, et cetera, then you create a much larger pie that hopefully proliferates across a number of the existing ecosystems and incumbents that we use today.
00:46:04.460 - 00:47:01.998, Speaker B: I definitely agree. I think, I mean, social kind of like crater esque economy to me is super fascinating because as you said it does lend itself really well to crypto rails. And today there has not been very many options outside of the historical monopolies that have existed. I think now it's interesting, Twitter throwing its hat, or we'll throw its hat in the ring and sharing some of the ad revenue. But outside of that, I mean, really the creator side of things. When you're a single creator and you're building a brand with that audience and exploring different ways to kind of monetize or share value with your audience, I think will be extremely fascinating. And, I mean, even looking at, like, I feel like every year a new report comes out and it says kids no longer want to be astronauts and doctors, they want to be youtubers.
00:47:01.998 - 00:47:19.730, Speaker B: And so if you kind of, like, continue on that trend, like, being able to help kind of individuals or even groups of people kind of monetize their creativeness on the Internet, I think, is very powerful. And so I'm personally excited about that as well.
00:47:20.590 - 00:48:28.930, Speaker A: Yeah, I think what's beautiful about that is also, that's also not like the first degree of, of benefit, in a way. And so what I mean by that is, to me, if you think about digital ownership and data sovereignty with what you do online, it unlocks the monetization as kind of like a second degree benefit. And the first degree is purely having control and having sovereignty of the stuff that you do online. And so the fact that there are trickle down effects that go beyond the initial benefit is super, super powerful. And being able to tap into that effectively, I think, is why there's so much stuff happening on the multisig homomorphic encryption MPC ZK side, really what we need to achieve. And even going beyond use cases, I think all the use cases that we see in web two, this is actually probably a better answer. I would say every use case of the Internet should be a goal for web3 to find parity in.
00:48:28.930 - 00:49:39.204, Speaker A: So one really cool innovation happening right now, or development happening right now, is this idea of ZKML. So zero knowledge machine learning. And I think that this discussion kind of came about over the years, and people arguing AI on chain big data doesn't make any sense whatsoever. But if you think about our consumer applications today, AI and ML is like, running the show, we just don't realize it. I think with chat GBT, it's kind of finally become in our face where you're like, wow, this chatbot is insane. But the recommendations on Netflix have been around for how many years now? Amazon and their recommendations with, with shopping your recommendations, that run the ad networks that provide you with tailored messaging and ads. And if we can essentially bring about the inference calls that exist within the process of machine learning and artificial intelligence and putting that on change so that we can develop this idea of trustless autonomy, that's incredible.
00:49:39.204 - 00:50:50.480, Speaker A: We are just one step closer to really realizing that every application can be put on chain because you're essentially taking a core piece of what is a black box, what is considered to many, the reason why this stuff needs to be brought to attention and why we need decentralization if you're able to put that on chain. We've started to unlock massive opportunities with really addressing things that should and can go on chain from social, from like your netflixes of the world, from streaming, so on and so forth. So I think like ZKML and so that's essentially utilizing ZK proofs to put the weights, put the architecture, put the actual prediction data that you're using on chain, and validating that the data that's being presented in the recommendation or the inference of the AI call is on chain is honestly such a beautiful thing. And I know a number of teams that are working on it, from modulus Labs to Xerox PaRC and a number of others. But that's an area that I'm personally very excited about, and it bridges the gap between infrastructure and applications.
00:50:51.740 - 00:51:03.800, Speaker B: Yeah, I would definitely echo that sentiment. I think if that all happens, then we go back to our initial conversation, or the beginning of the conversation, we need a whole lot more block space.
00:51:05.170 - 00:51:06.110, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:51:06.890 - 00:51:51.230, Speaker B: Step by step and then maybe progressing slightly. One thing that we touched upon, I think, initially is maybe some of the physical infrastructure and how outside of or using the crypto incentives, whether it's a token or like blockchain rails, how are you kind of thinking about like the, I think they call it now Tippins as the acronym. How are you kind of thinking about that category and kind of blockchain's future role within that?
00:51:52.530 - 00:53:31.600, Speaker A: Yeah, so there was this real world, so this was another kind of tertiary event. Denver is kind of like the real world on chain event that was really touching on all the different machines and the data that these machines or these hardware devices, Internet of Things devices generates and putting that stuff on chain, tokenizing a lot of that. I think that that's an area that's super early, earlier than a lot of the stuff that we talked about, in a sense that I would say a lot of the companies that we saw or we see today are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and still trying to figure out the proper token design. I think token design is the crucial aspect of that space. But why is it important? Taking a step back? I think it's really important because if you think about the data landscape as it stands today, there's even the existing data landscape within web3. We're taking off chain data, pouring it on chain with some oracle service and product, but there still exists that dataset off chain, despite a part of us being assigned to, say, owning that data or having some level of decentralization and sovereignty associated to that data within the web3 realm of products. The copy that lives off chain and then the products that revolve around that data off chain is still not decentralized.
00:53:31.600 - 00:54:54.640, Speaker A: If we really think, however, maybe decades ahead or hundreds of years, who knows of this very utopian vision of true distributed networking, user ownership of everything digital, we need that transition of hardware to on chain to be absolutely seamless. So I experimented with this a bit a few years ago. I tried to build a decentralized wearable, because in my mind, if I'm taking health data and I want to do something with it, like, say, own my health data, the value that you can accrue through true ownership versus partial ownership because part of it is owned by Apple or whoop or oura ring, doesn't truly make sense, right? And the only way to properly mitigate against that risk and the risks associated with that partial ownership is when the data is originated. You take that data and it automatically gets ordered on chain directly from the hardware on chain, and there is absolutely no copy. And then the storage aspect is another kind of category that I'm super excited about are we've ipfs, storage, Sia, et cetera, et cetera. That opens up a whole new opportunity. But now it's like I truly own my data.
00:54:54.640 - 00:55:40.860, Speaker A: My heart rate data that I collected over the last 24 hours, if I built out this wearable, is now owned by no one else. But my private key that I have, and there's no copy of it. If you scale that across every hardware device, the sensors on your cardinal, the Internet data that you're producing from your usage, all of that is owned by you. Most of the data is from these hardware devices, the cameras on the side of the street and so on and so forth, now we've opened up the actual true decentralized network that everyone is thinking about. That's why I'm super bullish on machine fight. That's why I'm super bullish on Solana's saga bone. I think people are very myopic with, like, oh, you know, decentralized apps.
00:55:40.860 - 00:56:16.870, Speaker A: And obviously on the negative side. Wow. Like, why is Solana building out a phone when their network's going down? Well, they're brave. They are taking the first courageous step of saying, we are taking the hardware approach. And we understand that the data that you're producing on your Apple device, regardless of it's, you're gated by the app store, you're gated by something associated to the hardware companies that are these walled gardens that we're trying to run away from. We're going to take a fully decentralized approach at data origination. The data you build on top of it are truly decentralized.
00:56:16.870 - 00:56:53.710, Speaker A: That's incredibly powerful. I'm thinking way longer term than most critics are, and that's one of the many reasons I'm bullish on Solana. And I just think that we're going to start seeing that happen over and over again. Jambo, a super app that first Africa, for instance, they built out their own phone. So think like the WeChat WhatsApp of China, but for Africa, they have their own phone. So it's starting to happen. I think it's a trend that will continue to grow and grow still very early, but I think it's a sign of a truly decentralized future.
00:56:54.570 - 00:57:26.154, Speaker B: Definitely, no, yeah. Lots of clarity there. I definitely agree. I think the original vision, regardless of which chain you're building on, to me, blockchain is self sovereignty. That was actually our first name for our fund. We had to change it for a variety of reasons. Self sovereignty, I think, is the true ethos of crypto more broadly.
00:57:26.154 - 00:58:20.842, Speaker B: And by owning that data, whether it's real world data that's being brought onto blockchains or different digital items in the web3 world, that sovereignty is a key component. And I think to that point, going back to earlier, talking about wallets and how wallets will ultimately still need to mature quite a bit. There's definitely a lot to be done in the web3 space to get us there, maybe talked about a lot. It's been super fun conversation. Maybe wrapping it up in the original podcast. I always did spicy questions at the end, and it was fun. I want to bring it back on, maybe just throw a couple at you.
00:58:20.842 - 00:58:28.830, Speaker B: What, like, ecosystem do you think in the blockchain space will not be here long term?
00:58:31.330 - 00:58:33.350, Speaker A: These are. Okay, these are spicy.
00:58:35.530 - 00:58:36.002, Speaker B: Correct?
00:58:36.066 - 00:58:36.746, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:58:36.858 - 00:58:41.070, Speaker B: Or dude. Or do you just think is doing like, kind of taking the incorrect approach?
00:58:41.930 - 00:58:46.686, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. I mean, I think proof of work? Actually, no, I can't say that.
00:58:46.718 - 00:58:47.490, Speaker B: Bitcoin?
00:58:48.510 - 00:59:27.696, Speaker A: No. Yeah, I mean, I think that. I think a very generalized answer to this is like, I think any ecosystem that has just failed with community is going to fail. And so I think there are a number of these that have kind of either, you know, you haven't heard a peep from them in months or, like, no one's really talking about them from user perspective. And I think that that's drawn predominantly from the developers. Right. And it's kind of like this Maslow's hierarchy of needs pyramid that I see, where it's like the developers consensus, the tech, like, that's all food, water, shelter, as you kind of go up.
00:59:27.696 - 01:00:13.240, Speaker A: If those core elements aren't addressed, then the users will be unhappy, and then you then hit a community aspect that kind of really is the flywheel and sustainability engine. And so, so I guess not going to name specifics, but any ecosystem that isn't properly addressing those and thinking about the trickle up or I guess, down effects of their lack of innovation, their lack of development, and just spending a ton of money for no reason. And I think a number of them have died off. I remember harmony, for instance, they were throwing massive parties at 2021 Basel, and I don't know what's going on there.
01:00:13.820 - 01:00:15.740, Speaker B: This main export is parties.
01:00:15.900 - 01:00:52.770, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And then I would say, because you have this open source ethos, if you can just have a very core lean team, I have so many examples of, and this is honestly a call out to every protocol as well, keep your team lean. Like, you don't need to be spending the capital that what we're familiar with seeing in the space during a bull market, like, stay lean, because if you don't do that, like, when, you know people are down bad, like, you're pretty much screwed. And so, and I think that's going to continue to happen. So anyone that just doesn't have that right mindset is for sure gone.
01:00:53.350 - 01:01:04.760, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Maybe like, flipping that question around, what is your, like, strongest held belief or conviction and kind of the space.
01:01:06.820 - 01:01:41.330, Speaker A: I think. Oh, wow, okay, so strongest doesn't have to be chains. Okay. Strongest held belief. We absolutely need to solve the on ramp process and whatever form factor that takes. I don't think, like, it should not be ignored. I think, yes, we're dedicating attention to it, but not enough, because if that's not solved, if it's not solved, you're going to have centralized entities come in and win, and we're essentially back to square one.
01:01:41.330 - 01:02:49.596, Speaker A: In my opinion, because they're going to reset the design space that's tailored to a very walled garden approach. And what do I mean by that? If I see a stripe come in, and this is just an example, but if I see a stripe come in, hypothetical example, a stripe come in and address the on ramp process, particularly around like e commerce, like that's not great. You know, I think Coinbase, you know, taking the decentralized approach of building out their own chain, love that. I don't necessarily think that certain centralized entities will replicate that same mentality. And so we just have to be very careful and we got to do it from the, we have to do it from the web3 side to win out another one is cross chain is inevitable. So we need to focus more on interoperability and then smart contract language. I think the battle between smart contracts is very similar to kind of not really the battle, but like the proliferation of the proper languages being used in proper financial institutions.
01:02:49.596 - 01:03:32.500, Speaker A: So if you look at most financial institutions, they're not building their core infrastructure on JavaScript. I think solidity is a JavaScript of web3 and the assembly and the c, and like the low level, high security code and the expertise associated to building on those languages needs to be what core infrastructure is brought to the web3 space. So that's why I'm so bullish on move. That's why I think for us, we'll continue to be such a strong player is because they address issues that solidity does not address. But solidity is so popular, JavaScript is so popular it'll be used, but I think we really need to think about low level smart contract language adoption, optimize adoption by developers so that we're building the right products for a sustainable future.
01:03:33.680 - 01:03:45.950, Speaker B: Interesting, awesome. We'll end the conversation there, but really appreciate you coming on the podcast. Alex, super interesting discussion and yeah, it was a lot of fun, thank you.
01:03:45.990 - 01:03:47.510, Speaker A: Yeah, this is super fun. Thanks, Logan.
