00:00:00.600 - 00:00:26.410, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for joining me, Nitesh. Really excited to have you here on this holiday early in the year. And so, yeah, I'm looking forward to chat and really all the things that you're building. I initially learned about DFLO at the breakpoint this past year and attended your mev chat with a couple others and was really inspired about what you're building.
00:00:27.600 - 00:00:33.940, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I'm stoked to be here. Thanks for having me. Feels like breakpoint was years ago at this point.
00:00:34.320 - 00:01:06.760, Speaker A: I know every breakpoint. I went to the first breakpoint in 2021, and that was kind of the mark of the picotop. And then shortly after this breakpoint was the FTS saga. So hopefully this one marks the bottom, but it does feel like fingers crossed. Yeah, but I would love to, before we dive into d flow, what you're building there, I would love to get a little bit more background and color on yourself, how you got into tech and then kind of more broadly like, what got you interested in crypto?
00:01:08.540 - 00:02:18.070, Speaker B: Yeah, was always pretty interested in computer science and tech, did CS at the University of Illinois and, you know, was always peripherally interested in crypto there, but never really dived into the guts of it. Spent a lot of time with like compilers, research and things like that there. So was always paying attention to the EVM and this idea of like a computer that was shared across nodes globally. So that I found really awesome and was just always playing around with it, but really kind of got into the depths of crypto in, I think, early 2021. So like December 2020, January 2021 was when I started actually writing code. And interestingly enough, I was at that point a quantitative researcher at TRW, so was really interested in kind of like the Defi markets, applications and project serum, of all things, was what kind of got me interested just because it was an order book on chain and order books were what I was doing my day to day on. So it was really interesting to see.
00:02:18.570 - 00:02:27.210, Speaker A: That's awesome. Yeah. So how far did you get down? Like, the rabbit hole with the EVM?
00:02:30.870 - 00:02:59.436, Speaker B: I kind of, like, looked at the opcodes and how it was structured and tried to go through some of the white paper stuff, but a lot of it was extremely, extremely academic and kind of boring, to be frank. I think the more applied stuff is definitely more interesting for me. And so when I messed around with solidity and started writing solidity, code was kind of when I think, really went into it full time.
00:02:59.628 - 00:03:37.590, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's super interesting. I really enjoyed Ethereum and all the things that the key innovations of the smart contracts that it unlocked, but then really got into scaling and I different virtual machines and how they work. And I was also amazed by serum and being able to build, like, a whole order book on chain. Could you talk about just a little bit more of your time and some of the things that you learned as a quantitative researcher and kind of how that led you to be, like, more interested in order books instead of, like, in amm?
00:03:39.210 - 00:04:54.646, Speaker B: Yeah. So I was on one of the low latency trading desks, and I I think naturally you just end up doing a lot of stuff really close to both programming and research when you're talking about trading at that latency level. And so a lot of my day to day was not only doing research and trying to come up with trading strategies from ground up, but helping other quantitative researchers with theirs, but then also going and implementing this and sort of really low level c, close to the metal things. And, yeah, I think what got me interested in CRM was this idea that there's pretty decent volume that's being traded through this decentralized order book. And I think in particular, I was most interested in the fact that given this is on chain, it's a whole new style of trading, and it's one that a lot of people aren't really that experienced in. And so I felt like there was opportunity there, and that kind of opened the gates to understanding that there was just opportunity everywhere in crypto, in terms of this is new infrastructure. It's going to stick around for a while, and it's going to make things a lot different in five to ten years.
00:04:54.646 - 00:04:58.222, Speaker B: So best to get acquainted with it now.
00:04:58.406 - 00:05:37.700, Speaker A: Definitely. I always think it's interesting how what was it, I guess, that ultimately wanted you or convinced you to make the jump? Because I think when I talk with a lot of people, once you have kind of gotten some level of success or that early ideas validated, everybody's like, yes, of course, you would obviously have left your job and have done this, but at that point in time, when you decide to do it, it's very not obvious and often very scary. So could you talk about the things that really convince you that crypto was this next iteration and next wave?
00:05:39.480 - 00:06:56.692, Speaker B: Yeah, I think fundamentally, the technology was really interesting, and I had heard of bitcoin before, but when you write your first solidity contract and deploy it, that's kind of when you realize that there's a whole unexplored paradigm of computation in front of you. I think that was the moment I started sliding into it. I think concretely, the moment when I decided to make the jump was when I started working on DFLO. It was basically based on the premise that retail traders in DeFi are getting horribly inefficient execution. It's just kind of ridiculous compared to equities markets. What you and I have to pay in fees and then what we get on top of that in execution quality when we trade tokens and you still see it like, it's shocking how long it's gone on. If you go and look at what you're paying in fees, when you swap on a wallet that's routed to uniswap, you're just, you know, you're getting ripped through.
00:06:56.692 - 00:07:16.564, Speaker B: So it's tough. And I think that was the moment, concretely, when I decided to make the jump, because I just realized this is something that won't last, and someone's going to build this infrastructure, and I would love for that person to be me because it's a really interesting problem service, definitely.
00:07:16.612 - 00:07:26.520, Speaker A: So maybe jumping into DFLO, can you describe what DFLO is and kind of your North Star or vision for creating it?
00:07:28.300 - 00:08:27.726, Speaker B: Yeah. So DFLO is a marketplace for order flow. It allows parties that have retail order flow to go and auction them off in a decentralized, permissionless auction to market makers. And it's really a model of payment for order flow. Although payment forward flow in crypto has a lot of different analogous names, people call it MEv extraction redistribution. It's all sort of payment for order flow, and payment for order flow in equities markets is MEV redistribution. But yeah, it's a permissionless model for order flow auctioning and purchasing by retail brokerages like the common wallets, and then market makers like your sort of common quant, market making firms can dive into a little bit about how it's different from tradfi pfoff, but there's just tons to double click on here.
00:08:27.726 - 00:08:28.414, Speaker B: So, elon?
00:08:28.462 - 00:08:57.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that would be a great place to start, because in the tradfi world, I think when you say payment for order flow, the biggest thing that people think of today, at least on the retail side, is kind of Robin Hood and some of like, the semi negative connotations around that. So I would love to have you kind of explain the differences between the tradfi and what you're trying to accomplish on, like, the decentralized front with payment for order flow with DFLO.
00:08:59.060 - 00:10:22.182, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the first thing is we're not trying to bring the Robinhood citadel dynamic into crypto. I think for a lot of us, we sort of believe in crypto being a different type of financial system, and we don't want Robinhood Citadel V two, but this time in crypto. And so I guess with that, it probably makes sense to dive into a little bit of why payment for order flow has a negative connotation in traditional markets and equities markets, and then how we're trying to basically take the good parts of payment for order flow and tradfi and bring it to Defi. And so in Tradfi Pfoff, you have market making firms like Citadel securities and brokerages like Robinhood, and these brokerages will sell their users order flow at predetermined prices and based on agreements with various axes and configurable parameters to, to the market makers. And this mechanism is called payment for order flow. Market makers are obligated to execute that retail volume at best prices, as measured by the national best bid and offer system. And that's the entire mechanism.
00:10:22.182 - 00:10:54.574, Speaker B: Robinhood sells order flow to Citadel. Citadel executes it at the NBBO or better. The problem with this mechanism is, the main problem, I would say, is the lack of transparency. I think, for users of Robinhood, they have no idea what's going on behind the scenes. I think Citadel isn't front running them. That's a common criticism of payment for order flow that I just don't think is likely, just because of the sheer audacity of doing something like that. It just makes it incredibly unlikely for that to be the case.
00:10:54.574 - 00:12:08.124, Speaker B: But what is actually a problem is that the national best bid and offer system doesn't effectively represent the best prices available for retail. And a lot of that is there's some market structure reasons, there's some technical reasons regarding latency and things like that. But the fundamental premise is that the NBBO isn't the best measuring stick for what the best available price is. We're taking this model of sell your order flow and execute it at the best price, but we're bringing it to crypto, where we can provably say this is actually the best price on chain anywhere, and we can say the market maker has to fill your order at this price or better. Otherwise, programmatically, it's rejected. There's cryptographic proof that the market maker is giving you the best price available, otherwise they wouldn't be able to use a smart contract, and the smart contract would reject their fills. That's one of the differences I'll pause there in case you have any questions? But the other difference is just the high resolution aspect of the market.
00:12:08.172 - 00:12:37.310, Speaker A: Prices on the flow definitely makes sense. I think maybe even backing up between, before we jump into more of the pros and cons of payment for order flow, is what, what is the main goal that payment for order flow actually accomplishes? One, for the people that are buying that order flow, and then secondly, the people that are selling these order flow to the market makers.
00:12:38.890 - 00:13:39.142, Speaker B: Yeah. Fundamentally, payment for order flow is an efficient market mechanism for executing volume, basically filling orders from retail traders. And the reason that it's actually like a good efficient market mechanism is because if you're a retail trader, you shouldn't have to pay fees to trade. Your flow is non toxic, which means statistically, over time, there's a lack of correlation with where the market is moving on the order of milliseconds, not on the order of minutes or hours or days or months. On that timescale, there is very much a correlation with where retail trades go. But on the order of milliseconds, no retail trader is trying to predict where the market is moving in the next ten milliseconds. There's a lack of correlation with where the market is moving and where retail's positions are on the order of ten milliseconds.
00:13:39.142 - 00:13:48.110, Speaker B: And so at that time scale, the flow is considered non toxic, and market makers are willing to pay a premium in order to execute that flow.
00:13:48.730 - 00:13:58.190, Speaker A: Intoxic order flow is just being the trades that are happening in that ten millisecond timeframe are trying to predict it.
00:13:59.610 - 00:14:56.320, Speaker B: So, toxic order flow, when I say that, I'm referring to basically the risk of adverse selection that market makers face. So market makers provide a really useful function in society, which is providing liquidity to people who want to buy and sell things. And market makers provide this liquidity, potentially at a cost, if the people who are buying and selling to them have more information, have more edge about where the market is moving, because at that point, every trade the market maker does, they lose money. And so in this scenario, they would stop providing that valuable function to society. And so when I say toxic versus non toxic flow, I basically mean toxic flow is flow where the market makers, on average, will lose money. Every trade. And non toxic flow is flow where the market makers will not lose money.
00:14:56.320 - 00:15:05.274, Speaker B: It will sort of be random whether they make money or whether they lose money on every trade. And this is, again, only at really, really tiny timescale.
00:15:05.322 - 00:15:10.190, Speaker A: So milliseconds definitely makes sense. I appreciate the clarity there.
00:15:10.930 - 00:15:11.950, Speaker B: Yeah, no problem.
00:15:15.090 - 00:15:40.410, Speaker A: So that's like a good overview of payment for order flow and why it's beneficial. And then talking a little bit about what, again, like what DFLO is doing, trying to do this in a decentralized fashion, essentially guarantee with the properties of smart contracts that you're getting the best payment or you're getting the best execution. And that is kind of provable on chain.
00:15:42.110 - 00:16:06.230, Speaker B: Right? Yep, that's the second half of this is we're trying to make the market mechanism that exists in equities markets, much more transparent, much more decentralized, and bring it to crypto, wherever anyone can verify these things, and also benefit from the good properties of payment order flow.
00:16:07.010 - 00:16:23.030, Speaker A: Excellent. One thing that you mentioned earlier was the order flow is the liquidity. Can you talk about the difference between institutional market makers, institutional takers and general retail traders a little bit more in depth?
00:16:24.700 - 00:17:41.604, Speaker B: Yeah. So that difference is basically what we were just talking about with the fact that institutional market makers are, you know, these firms that are providing a valuable function to society, which is providing liquidity and being able to allow people who want to trade with them to trade with them whenever and across many different venues, institutional takers. So I think you should primarily, in the context of payment for order flow, think of prop trading firms that are quantitative and low latency, and institutional takers, in the sense, are the trading firms that generate toxic flow and that market makers would like to avoid trading with, if possible. And then the last party that you mentioned is retail traders, which market makers would like to be counterparty to. And the reason for that is because retail traders, when they swap tokens, they generally are swapping for the long term aspects of it, or the utility of the token that they want to receive. Like maybe they want to buy Eth so they can do things on the ethereum network rather than buying ETH, so that they can make a profit on the order of 15 milliseconds. That's the difference between the institutional takers and retail traders.
00:17:41.604 - 00:17:42.760, Speaker B: Retail takers.
00:17:43.180 - 00:18:16.580, Speaker A: Gotcha. Very interesting. Now it's all fascinating. And when you peel back the curtains, there's definitely a lot going on, going on, and it's more nuanced than people think, especially in the tradfi world, where a lot of it's opaque, even once you do peel back the curtains. So maybe before we jump more into what deflow is doing, can you talk about wanting, or at least initially, building this on Solana? I think, why did you not decide to build on any other chain? Why choose Lana?
00:18:18.240 - 00:19:31.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Solana was probably in terms of. There are a few reasons here. I think the auctioning model benefits from high transaction throughput, but that's not the fundamental reason we chose to build on Solana, because the auctioning model is actually something that would work on Ethereum as well. The reason we chose to build on Solana initially was primarily just because that was what I was most familiar with. That's kind of where I first jumped into crypto and played around with more serious contracts, and that was one of the reasons. But I think since then, we've moved on to an app chain, and the reason for that is because this style, fundamentally what we're doing is mev redistribution and basically extracting the MEV out of the order flow at the application layer and directing 100% of it back to the user. So we're just giving them all of the MEV back from their order flow.
00:19:31.490 - 00:19:51.380, Speaker B: In order to have. In order to be able to build this application, you need a lot of control over the validator stack. And so initially on Solana, I think we realized we needed more control over the validator stack than we initially had, and so we moved over to a app chain.
00:19:51.880 - 00:20:18.080, Speaker A: Very cool. Interesting. I did not know that part. So on the app chain side, I think today, in my mind, there's kind of like two main kind of competitors, one being avalanche and the other being cosmos. Could you talk about which one you chose? How did you decided to choose it? And then kind of, what is some of the things that you're looking for specifically in the app chain?
00:20:19.580 - 00:21:22.390, Speaker B: Yeah, we're building on top of the Cosmos SDK, but I would sort of emphasize, like, the maintain. The main thing we were looking out of, whatever infrastructure we chose to use was just how, I guess, how good of an engineering job the open source community had done, and we certainly intend to contribute back as well. I think the Cosmos SDK did a really good job, given how it's architected. It's got a really elegant architecture, and it made it really easy to build our application on top of it, as well as modify any layers that we wanted to. The architecture just made a lot of sense for what we were choosing to do. We didn't look too closely into avalanche, to be completely honest. I think it really just came down to the fact that the Cosmos SDK and the community there was just perfect for what we were looking to do, and so we just moved forward with it.
00:21:22.550 - 00:21:32.730, Speaker A: It makes sense on the tech side. What things, particularly, are you looking to customize that would have been more difficult on a general purpose chain.
00:21:34.230 - 00:22:50.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say the primary thing is low latency communication between retail traders and market makers. And sort of as an example of this, if we, if a retail trader wants to get a quote from a market maker, if in that process, on chain state has to be updated for every quote the market maker gives, even on the fastest chain you can think of, that's too slow. Market makers are quoting and updating their quotes extremely often, and it's impossible to do that. It's impossible to require the quotes to settle into a block in order to get them over to the retail trader. So latency between these two parties is what we were looking for. And in particular, we're going to be releasing some information about this mechanism we're calling optimistic coordination, which is sort of a general purpose mechanism that two parties can use to communicate with each other in a way where the node that's sort of reverse proxying this communication is trustless. And so we avoid the doubly trusted relay problem.
00:22:50.200 - 00:22:58.360, Speaker B: We have no trusted components, and these two parties still get to communicate with each other in a low latency way.
00:22:59.260 - 00:23:17.900, Speaker A: Gotcha. So just to reiterate, the biggest problem with general purpose chains and what you experienced on Solana was specifically kind of oracle updates and being able to do market updates for the on chain border books, because the latency was too high for both of those things combined.
00:23:19.320 - 00:23:39.946, Speaker B: Right. Like, just to illustrate this, let's say you open up metamask and you want to receive a quote from a market maker. If that quote needs to settle into like, the Ethereum blockchain or the Solana blockchain, before you're even able to see it, that number of milliseconds is still too high.
00:23:40.138 - 00:23:42.830, Speaker A: So the finality of the transactions.
00:23:44.210 - 00:24:44.330, Speaker B: The finality of the transactions, and then just being able to, I guess, have a good user experience when you're trading, get quotes quickly, be able to interact quickly with the market maker. These interactions are super important for a good ux. And that was one of the things that was really important. The other thing that I haven't mentioned yet that's also really important for why we chose to build on an app chain, is the fact that we can now support pretty much any blockchain, any network, any layer one or L2, because we abstract the actual settlement layer away. So the DFLO app chain, in order for it to support a new network swaps on a new network, we essentially need to write a parser for the transaction buffer, which I think to simplify that statement. It's maybe a week or two's worth of work. It's another big gain that we get.
00:24:44.750 - 00:24:57.290, Speaker A: Interesting. And you said settlement. Are you doing execution on that chain as well or are you doing it? Can it be on any other zero one?
00:24:58.740 - 00:25:33.180, Speaker B: Yeah. So the app chain itself, its only responsibilities are to host the auctions and to facilitate communication between the retail trader and the market maker. The actual tokens that are being swapped, they are not bridged over to the Dflow chain. And so they remain on what I refer to as the settlement network. But its just eth layer one, or Polygon or Solana. And the DFLO network is able to interact with these chains by building transaction buffer parsers.
00:25:33.760 - 00:25:49.100, Speaker A: Very interesting, very cool. One of the things that you talked about specifically was mev and giving me back to the people. Could you talk about your thoughts there and what the goal is?
00:25:50.640 - 00:27:34.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I think generally how I see MEV redistribution playing out over the next year or two is right now we're in this phase where users will go and try to swap tokens and their swap transaction generates some amount of MEV. And that generated amount can be split up into two categories. There's an atomic MEV, which is just basically how much can you arb this swap for against current decentralized venue prices? And then there's statistical MEV, which is more a function of like it's a more quantitative thing, where if this trade happened at this point in time, is it likely for other things to happen at other points in time? And you can then, you know, order transactions in a way that you take advantage of this non atomic opportunity that's created. And I think right now where we are today is people focus a lot on atomic MEV and the fact that you can arb a user and then give them some percentage of it back. I think long term we're going to end up in a place where atomic MEV 100% goes back to the user. And statistical MeV is the only thing that's sort of competed on for giving rebates back to back to the user. And so what DFLO is doing is just giving right off the bat, we just give 100% of the atomic MEV back to the user, which is far more competitive than I think most MEv redistribution systems.
00:27:34.440 - 00:27:46.260, Speaker B: And then the statistical MEV is in equities markets. That's just called market maker rebates. That goes over to the user as well.
00:27:47.040 - 00:27:51.340, Speaker A: Interesting. And why are you returning 100% of the atomic MeV?
00:27:53.160 - 00:28:44.086, Speaker B: I think there are a few reasons for this. One, fundamentally, I believe that retail traders should not be getting arped and then given some percentage of whatever Arp they generated as sort of payment for that arpennae. I think that's an inefficient system. And if you look at how the equities markets work, that system is illegal. You call that front running and the SEC doesn't like that. And so not only is it illegal, it's just, it's way too competitive for market makers to actually compete for that order flow to be pulling that sort of shenanigan. Even if it isn't, even if it wasn't illegal in equities markets, it would just never happen because there's too much competition for retail equities flow.
00:28:44.086 - 00:29:42.884, Speaker B: The reason it happens in crypto is because there's not really that much competition for retail crypto flow. And so that's kind of going back to what I was saying earlier, which in the next year or two we're going to see a lot of competition for retail flow and building infrastructure around. Trying to give retail users some amount of, you know, some percentage of their atomic r back is an inefficient system and an inefficient thing to focus on. With infrastructure built around order flow auctioning in the first place, you know, it's, it's gonna go away. It'll be pointless to try and, you know, give a percentage of atomic mev back to the user. We're saying 100% goes to them off the bat. And the way we're doing that is you have to give them best execution, you have to give them the best available printed price on any centralized or decentralized venue, including price improvements and size improvements.
00:29:42.884 - 00:29:57.280, Speaker B: And 100% of that, that translates to 100% of MeB goes to them. And on top of that you pay them market condition based rebates. And that's the statistical Mev component.
00:29:58.040 - 00:30:09.060, Speaker A: One thing you mentioned there was best pricing, whether on chain or off chain. With off chain having higher latencies and kind of slower pricing updates. How are you able to guarantee that?
00:30:11.000 - 00:31:33.470, Speaker B: Yeah, so one thing we're doing differently here is we're not going to be bringing prices and price prices on chain. The way that we're planning on measuring what is best execution is allowing users of the DFLO infrastructure. So in this case, think if someone builds a wallet and they want to make sure their users are getting the best prices, that operator of the wallet can basically provide a custom function to the DFLO network that the DFLO network can ping and say and receive a best price from. And that's an off chain component, but it's interfaced with in a decentralized way. And in that way, we are sort of making it so that whoever is supplying this function, this, I guess, off chain function, can aggregate liquidity from any source that's both decentralized or centralized. And the DFLO network, in some of the optimistic coordination stuff we're doing, will be able to basically read values off Binance's best bid and offer fill orders.
00:31:33.810 - 00:31:40.350, Speaker A: Interesting. And is this going back to the app chain? This is uniquely enabled by the app chain?
00:31:42.130 - 00:32:00.710, Speaker B: I think this is uniquely enabled by being able to control the validator stack. And so, yeah, I don't think we would have been able to build this sort of mechanism on an existing layer one, and we just sort of had to move over to an app chain.
00:32:01.770 - 00:32:14.070, Speaker A: Very interesting. So is it kind of your prediction that majority of defi moves over to these app chains where they have higher control over validators over the long term? I'm curious.
00:32:17.730 - 00:33:10.270, Speaker B: I think we will see some types of applications move over to the app chain. I think the, you know, we'll see a lot of applications try the app chain, and some of them will stick and some of them won't. I think a good criteria for whether an application should use an app chain is whether they are technically capable of building their application on a layer one. If they're technically capable, if it's possible to do that, then they should do that for the security benefits, the decentralization benefits. But if fundamentally their application doesn't work without being able to control the validator stack, then they should not move over to an app chain. And Mev extraction, in my opinion, is not a great reason to move over to an app chain. I think it really just comes down to fundamentally does this technology work on a layer one? If not, build it on app change?
00:33:10.850 - 00:33:31.630, Speaker A: Makes sense. Very interesting. Yeah, lots of different things to consider when building this. A lot more than I think people would realize when they go out and want to say, I want to build a Dap, there's a lot more nuance going behind all the decisions going into it.
00:33:33.490 - 00:34:09.918, Speaker B: For sure. Yeah, and this was definitely kind of a learning process for us, too. We started building this in the summer of 2021, and we've just learned a lot about not only order flow, but what market makers want from an application like this, what wallets want from an application like this, all of the small little pitfalls that could break this, like super nuanced things that you kind of only get to. Bye. Crossing the bridge once you get there, and I think we've learned a ton, are super excited to get this out into the world.
00:34:10.094 - 00:34:26.450, Speaker A: Yeah. Could you share a little bit more? I mean, I'm sure you've talked with quite a few market makers now at this point, kind of trying to understand what they want. Could you kind of articulate that to the rest of us on what they're really looking for when they're doing decentralized market making?
00:34:28.510 - 00:36:14.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in the specific case of order flow auctioning infrastructure, they care a lot about the non toxicity of flow and the fact that if they're buying, let's just say, wallet A's order flow, then they should have strong guarantees that the order flow is actually coming from wallet A. And they're sort of like, consequentially, if you have that information, you have two options for how you would build an order flow auctioning infrastructure. One of them is what we actually did in our first iteration of DFLO, which is we would combine all of the order flow from many different wallet sources, and we would combine it into a bucket which is based on the token type, like the token pair. So we would take all of the wallets ETH USDC flow, put it into a single auction, and we would let the market makers bid into this auction. And that's actually non optimal because you kind of model the various levels of toxicity of all of the different sources, and that hurts the revenue that the non toxic order flow sources see, and that helps the revenue of the toxic order flow sources. But in both cases, this is just bad for market makers because market makers are able to reason, you know, less strictly about what they're purchasing. Another thing that we've learned that market makers really like is they want to be able to reason about what they're purchasing in the, in trading terms.
00:36:14.694 - 00:36:49.210, Speaker B: So it's easier for a market maker to basically say, hey, I want to buy $1 billion worth of ETH USDC flow. Rather than try to compete in an order by order auction for every single order, they can sort of say, okay, I'm going to buy this flow. I know I'm getting $1 billion worth of notional size delivered to me from this wallet. And that's a really strong guarantee to give market makers. So it's just small learnings like that really helped building this product to be attractive for market makers.
00:36:50.990 - 00:37:16.350, Speaker A: Definitely lots of nuance. And again, I want to bring it back to the user and why the user ultimately benefits from this. So could you maybe just re articulate your vision for DFLO. And some of the things that DFLO uniquely helps from the user aspect when their order flow gets routed to kind of these different market makers.
00:37:18.250 - 00:38:11.494, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I won't name any wallets, but you can probably get, there are actually many wallets with this fee structure of they'll charge something like 55 basis points, 50 basis points in their own fees, and then the amm that they route to will charge something like 30 basis points. And so in aggregate, the user ends up paying something like 70, 80, 90 basis points on every trade they do, every swap they do. And of this 70, 80, 90 basis points, the wallet only sees something like 50 basis points. 30 basis points goes to the aim in a DFLO system. Let's say if a wallet integrated with DFLO, the user pays zero basis points to the DFLO infrastructure. So that's -30 to the AMM already.
00:38:11.494 - 00:38:42.120, Speaker B: So now the user is only paying, let's say, 50 basis points. That's what the wallet is charging them, and zero basis points to DFLO. So now user pays less, and wallet makes a higher percentage of the fees that the user is paying. And in fact, the wallet makes 100% of the fees that the user is paying. And then on top of that, the wallet and the user get rebates from the market maker, which could sort of be anywhere from one to ten basis.
00:38:42.160 - 00:39:17.380, Speaker A: Points, possibly more, possibly less interesting. So just to reiterate, from the user standpoint, they get lower kind of swaps or trades on their end, and then from kind of the wallet infrastructure side, kind of a partner, if you will, they get to keep a higher percentage over the overall kind of revenue collected from people swapping on these trades. So it helps both parties.
00:39:19.290 - 00:40:03.972, Speaker B: That's exactly right. And in addition to that, there's also the question of execution quality. When you're trading on an amm, it's questionable what execution quality you're getting. You're probably being front run at some points in time. So yeah, with deflow infrastructure, it sort of guaranteed that you're not only getting best execution quality, you're paying zero basis point fees. And all of this is thanks to the fact that your flow is non toxic. And the DFLO infrastructure lets your flow trade at a market price, which is, it's all just all of this fee savings and high execution quality is enabled by the fact that we let the order flow trade at market prices.
00:40:03.972 - 00:40:09.080, Speaker B: And it's a market structure innovation. Fundamentally, what d flow is.
00:40:09.460 - 00:40:37.960, Speaker A: Interesting. Very interesting. Yeah, lots of nuance and kind of parsing apart. But I think that's kind of the interesting part of the long form conversations is to have some of these more like, intricate details. One of the other things that you mentioned was kind of the composability aspect and how you can compose within DFLO. Could you share a little bit more about that and kind of, I guess, what you would like to see on that front?
00:40:40.460 - 00:41:14.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I think when I think of composability with DFLO, there are a few directions that we can go with this. I think one is we can basically support the order flow sale from any type of application. And this includes decentralized protocols. So decentralized protocols can sell their order flow through DFLO. And this is true despite the fact that DFLO is an app chain. So that's one example of composability. Go ahead.
00:41:14.710 - 00:41:36.950, Speaker A: No, I'm still trying to wrap my head around this app chain thing. So even, say, like, for example, we use Ethereum and Solana, the more popular communities today. How are they able to do that? Composability within dFlow. If DFLo is its own app chain on Cosmos.
00:41:38.850 - 00:42:25.300, Speaker B: Right. Fundamentally, it's because the tokens are never bridged over to the DFLO network. And the DFLO network, I guess, just to walk through the lifecycle of a trade on Solana, for example, if you want to trade to SPL tokens for each other, how this works with DFLO is you basically go to any node on the DFLO network, and you, I mean, when I say you, I mean your client code. So the wallets code would basically ping the dflow network and ask for a quote from the market maker that has already won this auction. So I guess that's another important detail. The auctions are precomputation. They're for future order flow.
00:42:25.300 - 00:43:19.210, Speaker B: So the wallet will ask the DFLO network for a quote and a transaction buffer. And that transaction buffer is fundamentally just two SPL 20 token transfers. And so this transaction buffer goes back to retail. Retail signs it, if they, if they like the price, send it back to the DFLO network. DFLO network sends it to the market maker, market maker signs the transaction and sends it to the Solana network. So in this model, the transaction, the tokens are never leaving the settlement network. So Solana, and with some of the optimistic coordination things we're doing, we're adding sort of economic incentives against dishonesty.
00:43:21.390 - 00:43:46.100, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. And then the liquidity itself, if it's not actually leaving Solana, in this example, are you fundamentally just trading on the Solana network? I'm confused. Like, I guess, like, I'm having a little bit of a difficult time wrapping my head around, like, where the app chain comes in.
00:43:48.840 - 00:43:59.184, Speaker B: Yeah. The app chain's purpose is just to host the auctions and then just to facilitate communication between the retail trader and the market maker.
00:43:59.352 - 00:44:03.660, Speaker A: So the order book, in a sense, is on the app chain.
00:44:05.330 - 00:44:50.240, Speaker B: Right. And rather than an order book, it's just sort of like a straightforward auction, a blind auction, where first price wins the order flow contract, so wins the right to receive the order flow. But, yeah, I guess that's the purpose of the DFLO chain, is just so that the auctions happen in a decentralized way, and the auctions are basically determine which of the market makers that participate on the D flow network receive the right to execute the flow, and then. So that's pretty straightforward state tracking, but that's the state that's on the DFLO network.
00:44:50.900 - 00:44:53.400, Speaker A: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you.
00:44:55.460 - 00:44:56.076, Speaker B: Yep.
00:44:56.188 - 00:45:20.760, Speaker A: You're kind of doing all this kind of in the background, again, to kind of give best execution to the trader, but then also provide additional benefits to kind of the third party infrastructure by allowing them to keep more of the fees instead of splitting that with a market maker. That would give them worse execution.
00:45:23.790 - 00:46:02.490, Speaker B: Right, right. So instead of having some of that MeV go to searchers and whatnot, 100% of the atomic mev goes back to the user. And so in this case, the user is either the wallet or the actual end user who's trading DFLO is unopinionated. So the wallet can choose to redistribute its earnings however they choose between themselves and their users. But, yeah, that's right. The wallet is getting some of the MEV back and can choose to distribute that with their users how they please.
00:46:02.950 - 00:46:32.550, Speaker A: Very interesting. Maybe kind of jumping forward a little bit, where do you kind of, or what do you envision? I think more broadly, Defi and crypto markets ends up looking like, because I think today we're kind of far cry for from what the tradfi markets are. So how do you envision it? Do you envision. Yeah, I would love to kind of get your thoughts on that.
00:46:34.450 - 00:48:21.320, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the reasons that Defi and crypto is sort of has this issue of there's not really that much liquidity available in many DeFi ecosystems. One of the reasons for that is just the fact that market makers aren't able to provide liquidity in a way that guarantees they won't just get ran over by toxic takers. I think this is fundamentally a problem when it comes to on chain order books or amms, where if someone wants to provide liquidity, they have no good mechanism to revise their quotes in a way that guarantees that someone who has a handshake deal with a validator or someone who just pays some block space auctioning infrastructure a little bit more won't be able to run over the market maker when the market moves. That's the fundamental problem, in my opinion, of what's holding crypto Defi back. Certainly there are questions of regulation and all that, assuming all things equal there. This is one of the more major issues with why DeFi hasn't really taken off in the way that we've seen, in the way that equities markets have. And I think that the GFLo type infrastructure is one of the solves, one of the key market infrastructures for bringing sophisticated market makers from a wide variety of places into crypto and able to provide liquidity on chain, because we make it fair for the market makers.
00:48:21.320 - 00:48:34.600, Speaker B: And I guess by making it fair, we bring a lot more institutional capital into crypto. And that just helps everyone that makes markets efficient, liquidity available, so on and so forth.
00:48:35.630 - 00:49:03.140, Speaker A: So really boiling it down to toxic versus non toxic flow and being able to better understand where those are coming from and if you can kind of. And what this is, what D flow is ultimately trying to enable that will allow better liquidity for market, or make market makers more comfortable ultimately, than allowing more liquidity for everybody.
00:49:04.800 - 00:49:39.130, Speaker B: Right. And I would just add the fundamental new thing that we are doing is we are allowing the order flow to trade at its own market price based on how toxic it is. So market makers will pay more for flow, they realize it's non toxic, and they will pay less for flow that they realize is toxic. Our infrastructure, its only purpose is to create these markets, enable the flow to trade at a market price, and the rest sort of takes care of itself.
00:49:39.470 - 00:50:04.280, Speaker A: Very interesting. Im fascinated by it all. I would love for majority of tradfi to ultimately end up on crypto rails. Do you think that in the end game that will happen or they will be two separate systems that will always kind of coexist?
00:50:06.500 - 00:50:55.900, Speaker B: No, I definitely think that a lot of tradfi will end up on crypto rails. I think that's one of the promises of this technology, is that it is genuinely better financial rails than what has existed in the past. Market forces are going to force infrastructure to move over to where things are most efficient. That's going to be crypto. It'll take a while. I think we'll see a lot of dog token type things, which I love. I'm not a critic, but until we start seeing more institutional capital, I think we're going to see a little bit more limited adoption for day to day uses and bigger infrastructural things.
00:50:56.400 - 00:51:30.360, Speaker A: True. I guess jumping off that with recent events and how 2022 played out with the FTX implosion, with some of these large lenders going under, what is your thought or conversations that you've been having with market makers or these institutional players? Do you feel like they're still open to these conversations, or now they're kind of like, wait and see? I'm curious just to get your thoughts on, like, how you think 2023 will play out.
00:51:31.900 - 00:52:39.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I think these events are great catalysts for DeFi because people are. They're worrying a lot more about counterparty risk than they did in 2019, 2020. And if you have at these large sort of institutional firms, if you have a committee that's dedicated to counterparty risk, and then you show them what DeFi is, their counterparty is an open source, smart contract, and that's to a risk committee that is actually intellectually litigating the quality of their counterparty, that's like, as high quality as it gets. That's who you want your counterparty to be, right? Like immutable code, right? It doesn't get better than that. So the conversations we've been having are pretty positive. I think a lot of people are bullish on DeFi, especially some of the quant trading firms that you hear about that haven't really forayed too much into crypto, but have been dabbling for years.
00:52:41.150 - 00:53:42.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm definitely excited for 2023. I stuck around. I was class of 2017 and ultimately stayed around after 2018. And when everything blew up in the world of Ethereum and all the icos that happened at that point in time, it was primarily just icos, and there wasn't even really usable products. I think at the very end, we got Dai, which was the first unsketchy stablecoins, and that was really the first product, but there weren't actually really any applications, per se. What makes me so much more excited now is that there are actual products. There's builders like yourself trying to figure out a lot of these really hard engineering problems, from going from the Tradfi world to making a better system and the web3 world.
00:53:42.126 - 00:54:19.550, Speaker A: And that does take some time, but the fact that there are people that are working on this, we already have at least usable products. We are seeing these high throughput chains, we're seeing these custom chains, the building blocks and pieces are there. And so when they get refined slightly more, I'm excited to see all these users kind of flow in and actually use web3 and crypto more broadly, because right now it's not very many people, but I know it's going to be around where in 2018 it was a little bit more, a little bit more worrisome when everybody left.
00:54:20.810 - 00:54:42.600, Speaker B: Yep, 100%. I think in December of this year, we're going to look back and see that a ton of new market structure has come out, and that's really going to lead the path for the next bull, whatever it may be. I think just true institutional adoption into everyone's day to day lives is what we're going to see after this year.
00:54:43.020 - 00:55:28.340, Speaker A: I hope so. I'm rooting for it, and I definitely agree. The best counterparty, in a sense, is just having that immutable code on that front. When you talk to people, I would say the only kind of pushback that I see or I hear is the smart contract risk and the code being hacked for whatever reason. Do you have any good answers of, yes, the smart contract is the best counterparty because you know the rules aren't going to change, but it is software, and software sometimes has issues and bugs. How do you kind of, in your conversations, does that come up at all?
00:55:30.040 - 00:56:32.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is actually just like the most fundamental question in crypto, because for people to believe in a system like bitcoin or ethereum, they need to believe in the cryptographic principles that sort of guarantee these systems can't, you know, you can't do things like double spend with them. And trusting a single smart contract on top of these systems is just that belief. But on a smaller scale. Like, you need to first believe that Ethereum is secure, and then once you believe the Ethereum protocol is secure, you'll start trusting contracts that that build on top of that. But really it just takes time. And the longer contracts have stuck around and the more experience people get at writing them and analyzing them, the more trust we will build for these systems. So this is, for me, it's just a question of time until people start truly understanding what is good and what is not.
00:56:33.470 - 00:56:53.920, Speaker A: I love it. I do agree. Maybe so. Wrapping it up 2023. Is there anything like, particularly ecosystem, either project or thing that you're really looking forward to? For this year as we re enter the builder's market.
00:56:56.340 - 00:57:23.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to all of the block space auctioning infrastructure becoming really, really widely adopted. I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think that's one of the things that brings institutional liquidity from market makers on chain because that sort of levels the playing field a little bit more than it is today. So that's one.
00:57:23.620 - 00:57:25.440, Speaker A: Did you give a good example of that?
00:57:27.380 - 00:57:58.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, on Solana Jito, for example, is a project that I really love, and they're building block space auctioning infrastructure for the Solana blockchain. I think if every validator used Geedo's infrastructure, that would make it a lot easier for institutional market makers to come and provide liquidity because now they can revise their quotes in a fair auction, a fair block space auction, rather than not having that.
00:57:59.020 - 00:58:02.560, Speaker A: That makes sense. I'm sorry I cut you off. Any other predictions?
00:58:04.700 - 00:58:24.000, Speaker B: No, I think other than that, I'm excited for it to be kind of quiet right now and for people just to be had sound and working, building stuff that's actually useful. I think we're going to see the fruits of that labor this year. So pretty stoked for that.
00:58:24.390 - 00:59:14.440, Speaker A: I agree. No, it's an exciting time. I think the people that are around now, just as they were in 2018, 2019, are the ones that ultimately really gain the benefits and see the fruits of their labor in a couple years time. Everybody today that's pushing the eco for them, building, making blockchains easier to use, making liquidity easier to bring on chain. These are going to be the people, and they are the people that are pushing the industry forward. And I'm very excited for when the next kind of bull market or expansion period comes. All these services will be extremely widely used and it'll be cool to just see people interacting with all these things on chain.
00:59:16.060 - 00:59:19.276, Speaker B: Yep, 100% could not be more perfect.
00:59:19.468 - 00:59:39.450, Speaker A: Perfect. Well, yeah, I really appreciate your time. Again, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Thank you for going into all the interviews, all the difference and nuances of order flow and the positive benefits that they bring to the industry and, yeah, thank you for helping pushing the industry forward.
00:59:40.470 - 00:59:42.670, Speaker B: Yeah, it was great to be here. Thanks for having me on the.
