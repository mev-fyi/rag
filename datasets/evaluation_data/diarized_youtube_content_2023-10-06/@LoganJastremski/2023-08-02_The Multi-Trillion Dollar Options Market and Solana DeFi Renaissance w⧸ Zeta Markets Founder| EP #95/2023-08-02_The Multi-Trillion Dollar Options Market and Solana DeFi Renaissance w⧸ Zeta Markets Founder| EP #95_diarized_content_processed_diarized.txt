00:00:00.480 - 00:00:09.686, Speaker A: Because there seems to be this massive information asymmetry, which you point to. A lot of people just don't have the time to read into how the chain works or do basic due diligence.
00:00:09.798 - 00:00:17.550, Speaker B: In my point of view, there's certain attributes that blockchains really need to scale. High throughput being one of them, parallelization being one of them.
00:00:17.590 - 00:00:45.810, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really nice segue, talking about parallelization and the kind of design space there, because that's exactly what draws to it. I started building out just a quick prototype. You know, we started brainstorming. What do we want to build? Settled on options. Because we're like, hey, it's a multi trillion dollar dollar industry. What if we can bring that on chain? So we started building that out on Ethereum, I guess, and it just did not scale. If you're trying to build real time derivatives, you know, complex risk management, all that kind of stuff just.
00:00:45.810 - 00:00:52.710, Speaker A: Just doesn't really work on Ethereum. L1 and l two. Coming to Solana, that was when I think, like, a bit of a light bulb went off.
00:00:53.650 - 00:01:11.460, Speaker B: Tristan, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast. Super excited to have you here. The founder of Zeta. Really looking forward to it. We were talking slightly earlier. We've never gotten to sit down and chat about what you're building, and so I think this is going to be a really fun deep dive.
00:01:11.540 - 00:01:13.500, Speaker A: Yeah, looking forward to it, and thanks for having me.
00:01:13.580 - 00:01:46.534, Speaker B: I want to kick it off, though. I feel like on the timeline, there's a true renaissance happening. I don't know if it's just me or kind of my Twitter bubble. There's a lot of echo chambers that I would say, or maybe can reclassify now as X.com dot. But I feel like, truly, there's a new shift going on, and especially in the Solana market, just Solana being the first high throughput network there, feels like there's a notable vibe change. Is that something that you also feel, or am I just making this up?
00:01:46.622 - 00:02:06.562, Speaker A: No, there's been a huge difference. I've got to say, for context, I've been building in the Solana space for the last two and a half years. I think we got started roughly at the start of 2021. That was also, I think, a big hype period. We kind of went through that. Solana was the hot thing on the block. Everyone was going crazy, wanting to invest, wanting to get in.
00:02:06.562 - 00:02:17.546, Speaker A: Things were going parabolic. You know, Sabre was getting to billions of dollars in TVL. It was, like, pretty crazy. And then we went through this, this real bear market phase post FTX, obviously there was a lot of fallout.
00:02:17.578 - 00:02:18.430, Speaker B: That was rough.
00:02:19.850 - 00:02:27.268, Speaker A: And we had to be out there like the founders and like the power users of Solana, having to, like, defend the chain and the apps on there. And, you know, the kind of value.
00:02:27.324 - 00:02:31.680, Speaker B: Proposition there, the 75 devs, we were killing the torch.
00:02:32.100 - 00:02:55.802, Speaker A: So that was really tough going through that, especially as a founder. People just kind of dismiss you straight away. You get on calls with people, trading firms, stuff like that, and they're like, oh, Solana, nevermind, you know, not interested. And I'm like, oh, that's a bit of a dismissive take on things. But it's interesting, like, you know, people have said this, the fundamentals haven't changed overnight. Nothing has really changed other than the switch flipped. They're like, okay, price going back up.
00:02:55.802 - 00:03:19.052, Speaker A: People have flipped bullish on this thing, and suddenly people are bridging in. I'm getting DM's of people who are like, how do I bridge my money into Solana? I want to start using these apps in Solana. I want to get in there. So it's been great to see. I mean, part of it, I think, is this airdrop narrative, which seems to be what brings new usage to all these chains. But I think it's the inevitable cycles of crypto. You have the booms and the busts.
00:03:19.052 - 00:03:21.996, Speaker A: Hopefully, we're seeing a bit of a renaissance right now.
00:03:22.188 - 00:04:00.990, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it is crazy. I mean, just being on the venture side, it's wild to me, just talking with other funds, how fair weathered many funds and investors truly are. And I think, to me, it's even highlighted the lack of technical understanding from the venture side to kind of be able to do the due diligence on the technical underpinnings of the different architectures and how they work. And I mean, no doubt post FTX was miserable. It felt terrible. But I think now, kind of coming through the other side, people have seen Solana is not going away. To your point, the builders kept building.
00:04:00.990 - 00:04:41.550, Speaker B: The narrative around the 75 devs was incorrect. The applications only got better, the network had better stability, and over time, things have just generally improved. And I think the narrative kind of around L2 is even optimism. I think putting out a post recently that they're seeing increased usage on an l two where their fees are spiking, and that just really doesn't happen on a Solana type architecture. And so I do slowly see you others on the timeline kind of being, uh, really fighting the good fight, not only for the products, but also for the ecosystem, and it's been amazing to see.
00:04:41.630 - 00:05:11.894, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. I appreciate it. Um, I think there are other, you know, great flag bearers out there. Like, you know, myrrt has probably been the biggest one as of late who's going out there and really defending, you know, tooth and nail. Solana, I'm not quite as much of a maxi, but I've been building this space long enough that I think people should actually understand what's happening under the hood or kind of appreciate, because there seems to be this massive information asymmetry which you point to. A lot of people just don't have the time to read into how the chain works or do basic due diligence. People come up with the same arguments.
00:05:11.894 - 00:05:22.606, Speaker A: It's like, oh, this is a Sam chain. It goes down, it's only open nine to five. And then you actually pop open the solana status page, and then you're like, oh, it's been up every second for the last six months.
00:05:22.638 - 00:06:03.058, Speaker B: So I think that's kind of invalidated 100%. Yeah, I would definitely agree. Don't be a maxi. I think in my point of view, there's certain attributes that blockchains really need to scale, high throughput being one of them, parallelization being one of them. And I think Solana being the first to really pioneer this new technology stack was massive, and it's been able to kind of capitalize on that with the community and having a very robust engineering ecosystem. But maybe before getting into a little bit of your background, I would love to just learn a little bit about why you decided to build Zeta ultimately on the Solana network stack.
00:06:03.154 - 00:06:37.266, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really nice segue, talking about parallelization and the kind of design space there, because that's exactly what drew us to it. I've been in crypto for maybe five or six years at this point, but not full time, been full time, closer to two and a half, three years. And so I used to work in, like, machine learning, engineering, data science, all that kind of stuff. So it was like, very hands on technical with a lot of, like, quantitative research, like AI, which is the hot thing now. But I was doing generative models before. It was cool. Like, that's what my thesis was on, like, many years ago.
00:06:37.266 - 00:07:02.628, Speaker A: So that was really interesting. And then crypto I saw as a really good opportunity to break into the startup space. I'd been interested in blockchain tech for a while, you know, actually did a bunch of my senior units in distributed systems, and it was something that was super interesting to me. And then I kind of missed the wave on, I guess, defi summer, what's happening with smart contracts? Because if you remember back in the 2017 days, there wasn't very much innovation happening there.
00:07:02.684 - 00:07:04.044, Speaker B: There was a lot of icos.
00:07:04.172 - 00:07:34.556, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of icos. There were very nascent projects like Kyber, which were doing on chain Dexs, but that was basically unheard of, and they had no volume. And it was funny, like, very backwards. Like, you had to actually pay yourself to market make and do all these weird things, apparently. I don't know, it was just very, very strange. And so I started listening to more of, like, you know, what Vitalik was talking about, what a bunch of other people were talking about, and it was all smart contracts, defi composability. And so I started building out just a quick prototype.
00:07:34.556 - 00:08:13.150, Speaker A: We started brainstorming, what do we want to build? Is it fixed rate lending? Like, I guess, what Pendle is doing now to great success. We pivot away from that, looking into, like, perps options, all these things settled on options because we're like, hey, it's a multi trillion dollar industry. What if we can bring that on? Chain feels pretty useful. Good kind of risk management hedging tools. So we started building that out on Ethereum, I guess, and it just did not scale. If you're trying to build real time derivatives, you know, complex risk management, all that kind of stuff just, just doesn't really work on Ethereum. And l two s, like, we talked to arbitrum years ago and, like, they just weren't launched, weren't ready.
00:08:13.150 - 00:08:42.640, Speaker A: And coming to Solana, that was when I think, like a bit of a light bulb went off. I got on a call with, with Toli, and he's just talking about, you know, elliptic key cryptography and, you know, PDA bump seeds and all this kind of stuff. And I'm like, wow, this guy's pretty smart, seems to know his stuff pretty well, and could answer a bunch of our questions. And I started digging into the docs, and there were like, no docs back then. It was pretty painful. There was one escrow example. You just had to literally chew glass, which is where I guess the meme came from.
00:08:42.640 - 00:09:26.374, Speaker A: That was a fun exercise. And we started building on there before anchor was out, ended up using that, and we built out this options platform, which we ran for a year, which did pretty well. We were the first one to write this black Scholes options pricing implementation, and we could do it fully on chain, which I think was pretty ingenious. To use a bunch. Yeah, we used a bunch of like, mathematical tricks, like kind of tricks that you learn from, I guess, like hardware and computing stuff just to minimize the compute units. And we could do like all these logarithms and, you know, crazy equations on chain that, you know, you would never think or even dream of doing on a chain like Ethereum. And then I think the thing that really drew me to Solana at the end of the day was the parallelism and throughput and how it scales.
00:09:26.374 - 00:09:53.936, Speaker A: So having come from machine learning, engineering, data science, AI, all this kind of stuff, everything is executed paralyzed on GPU's. You have these massive batches, and it's all about like, if you were to run something on a simple python script on your cpu, you wouldn't get very far. You wouldn't be able to trade these huge, like, language models or anything, for that matter. It's all about parallelization. And so I kind of appreciated that having used, you know, all these distributed computing technologies like Spark and all these.
00:09:53.968 - 00:10:36.380, Speaker B: Things, that is the most, like misunderstood thing. Like Moore's law in some sense is kind of dying in the amount of transistors that you can, like, put on a single chip. I mean, apple, I think they're in like two or three nanometer, like very, very tiny. But all the gains have really come from parallels and being added additional cores to the chips. And as you mentioned, the more cores and the more things that you can paralyze, the more workloads you can do. And so I find it fascinating that people still in the blockchain world are predominantly in the ethereum world. Don't understand this, maybe.
00:10:36.380 - 00:10:47.878, Speaker B: I think it was just like a different architecture design. They're much earlier, but it still fascinates me that they're not trying to incorporate some amount of parallelism into their protocol.
00:10:48.004 - 00:11:34.880, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. I mean, I see Monad basically trying to rewrite the EVM and do it in like a parallel way, which is, I'm pretty excited to see there's still not that much information, but that's some steps in the right direction. I think it's a great model. Like, if you have two dexs that don't share state, like, why should they be kind of doing this right locking and kind of have contention with one another? They should just be able to operate independently. And so far, like, it's, it's been working pretty great, the throughput is great, and now that they've more or less solved the fee market stuff, it's still not perfect, but it works quite well. I remember I put out a tweet because Tolly was asking all the defi builders, like, what happened when the market ripped with bonk? They're like, did it affect any of your systems? And I looked at our TPS graph and any of failed transactions on our decks, and it was just basically like a blip or something like insignificant. So I was like, that's amazing.
00:11:34.880 - 00:11:47.334, Speaker A: All this on chain congestion transaction volume happened and there was just no fallout compared to back in the day. An ideo would launch on radium and it would bring down the whole chain every time. That was frustrating.
00:11:47.502 - 00:12:14.902, Speaker B: There's been many network upgrades, which we're very appreciative of and I'm sure on the building side. So I think with Zeta, you obviously have a very large ambition and a lot of bringing, I would say on a larger scale, just bringing the tradfi world on chain. Can you dive a little bit deeper into the grand vision and what you're trying to do at zeta markets?
00:12:15.006 - 00:12:54.330, Speaker A: Yeah, sure thing. We really want to build, I guess, the ultimate trading experience on chain. So we kind of started off with these very complex derivatives, and we think that's where a lot of the price discovery happens. We're more focused on purps and stuff like that now being the most liquid instrument in crypto. I think derivatives, as per the last jump report that I read, does more than 50% of all volume in crypto markets. So it's always like taking over volume, market share from spot, which I think is how markets mature. If you probably look at Wall street in the early days, I'm sure it was all equities, and spot trading moves towards derivatives, options, all this really complex stuff.
00:12:54.330 - 00:13:27.020, Speaker A: That's where you get leverage, that's where you get, obviously, capital, efficiency, price, discovery, all these kind of things, which is great. So we're trying to focus on derivatives first, but eventually we want to be basically the full suite. We want to have, like, perps, options, potentially futures, spot maybe lending at some point, but it would be nice to have that all under the one roof. So far, it's just perps. It's been going well. We're building it on chain because we think at the moment that's the way to go. And Solana kind of unlocks quite a lot of potential there.
00:13:27.020 - 00:13:58.770, Speaker A: You get big benefits versus what you see in traditional finance. Traditional finances works great. It's Lindy. It's been around for a long time, but markets are only open certain hours. It's kind of difficult to get involved there's lots of middlemen taking fees and all this kind of stuff. It's run on legacy infrastructure from probably seventies and eighties and who knows, then you get CFI, centralized crypto finance, binance and all these guys, great products. They run 24/7 markets on crypto, but they're a complete black box.
00:13:58.770 - 00:14:14.634, Speaker A: Who knows what they're doing with their risk management, with their balance sheet. You obviously saw this with FTX. They were basically committing fraud in the background and it blew up big time in their face. Whereas defi. The great thing is everything is on this public ledger. You can audit everything. It's very transparent.
00:14:14.634 - 00:14:36.984, Speaker A: You can see what's happening in the order book. So we think that's the way to go, transparency and then hopefully composability. Lots of people building on top of these primitives. And then it's just similar to the grand vision of serum, which was one core order book where all the liquidity funnels into and you just become that protocol layer. It's just APIs and front ends into all this stuff and you actually share the liquidity.
00:14:37.112 - 00:15:38.494, Speaker B: Yeah, that's amazing. I do, I love the vision of being have everything on chain and really, as you mentioned, that audibility piece and just that full transparency. And I think when you combine that with the fact that you have self custody, when especially on a chain like Solana, where you have composability as well, you get a lot of magic that can potentially happen. And I would still say in these giant kind of global single state machines like Solana, the composability, in my opinion, is still early. It's going to take effect eventually, but the teams are all still really building and kind of figuring out how to build their product and kind of go from zero to one and then you can add the composability piece. And I'm super excited to see once the teams have kind of built out their products, how they can really integrate with others to uniquely leverage each other.
00:15:38.622 - 00:16:06.858, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. I think you're seeing a lot of teams still vertically integrating at the moment and just building the stack. Like, to be honest, that's sort of what we're doing because I think things are still very nascent. You kind of have to go from the rust smart contract all the way up to the end user and build the whole user interface. And you can't really rely too much on external teams, but I think over time that will change. You're already seeing it happening in like amms on Solana. You've got maybe like ten different amms and you've got Jupiter just slapped on the top as the aggregator.
00:16:06.858 - 00:16:36.296, Speaker A: And I just don't use amms themselves anymore. Like I always go to Jupiter, it finds me the best prices, it's got the best interface, it just works incredibly well. And I think you're going to see this happen more and more. It's a bit harder in derivatives because you have leverage and things like that. You can't just like wrap up, tokenize risk and just ship it off somewhere else. There is some kind of warehousing of risk and figuring out how to deal with that. But I think it takes time and I'm looking forward to this new wave hopefully of builders coming into the ecosystem.
00:16:36.296 - 00:16:46.560, Speaker A: Obviously it dried out a bit in the bear market, but I think more hackathons and more opportunities, people will come back and now there will be established primitives for all these different financial use.
00:16:46.600 - 00:17:31.173, Speaker B: Cases that people can build on 100%. And to that, I mean, maybe going back to this solana component a little bit more. I mean, you talked about some of the issues kind of with the radio ido taking down the Solana network. Obviously that's very problematic for DeFi. Anytime you have like network outages and Solana kind of continued to iterate over time. You also talked about different compute limits, the read and write locks contentions for the technical side of the audience. Can you talk a little bit about how you have to design the protocol in a highly paralyzed system to be able to take advantage of that throughput that it does offer?
00:17:31.301 - 00:18:06.038, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, a lot of the details, I guess, are sort of handled under the hood for the most part. I guess in terms of how it's reading and writing, you do have to do a bit more overhead. For example, the read write sets. When you do post a transaction or like an instruction, you have to specify essentially what accounts you're reading and writing to. And then it can basically just figure out like, oh, are these, you're familiar with distributed systems and you're writing to account a and account b. You kind of had to schedule them or single thread that in a sense, or like the order matters, whereas if they're just not overlapping, you can kind of touch them independently.
00:18:06.038 - 00:18:28.474, Speaker A: That's a bit of overhead for the developer. You got to basically specify all the accounts ahead of time and you got to basically label them as read only or read write. That's a bit of overhead on the dev. It's not too bad though, and I know aptos and stuff are trying to do optimistic version of this, essentially, where you don't have to pass it in. I don't know if that's the most efficient way. Yeah, exactly. We'll see how that goes.
00:18:28.474 - 00:19:09.730, Speaker A: To be honest, we haven't found it that bad. The thing that's maybe been a bit of a pain with Solana is it used to have very limited account limits. This actually blocked a lot of innovation for us and other teams for like, a very, very long time, because I think, what is it? Your public keys are 32 bytes, I'm pretty sure, and you can only really fit maybe 35 or so into like the, I don't know, 1 mb limit or whatever they have on transactions. That was always a blocker for us. We would always be capped by the amount of accounts you could do it, put in. And when we were trying to do all this really complex options stuff back in the day, we couldn't do like cross margin or things like that because we just had too many accounts. Now, shaving that down to just perps, it's been way easier.
00:19:09.730 - 00:19:46.146, Speaker A: Plus, Solana came out with this really cool update called account lookup tables. So instead of passing in 32 byte public key, all you do is you pass in like a u eight index, essentially. So a number zero to 255, I guess, and that just looks up on an account that's on chain, and then you can actually fetch the public key or the account from there. So instead of passing the actual big lot of bytes, you're just looking up things on chain, which is pretty elegant design, and it works great. We just wrote up cross margin and it's shipping in like two weeks beautifully. I've just been trying it out.
00:19:46.258 - 00:20:22.428, Speaker B: Congrats. You said you're predominantly focused on perps, but future want to continue to expand. Would things like firedancer kind of unlock more of that? Are you today kind of limited by the underlying network, or is it more so? Just like as a team, there's a certain amount of priorities that you guys have to focus on to just make wonderful experiences and perps. Is today the thing that you're focusing on to make sure that it's perfect for the user aspect?
00:20:22.524 - 00:20:53.060, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great question. I guess there's two threads to pull on there. One is which instruments you offer, and then one is just the general scalability of the exchange on chain versus off chain. Stuff like that. In terms of instruments, we started off as an options platform. I think options are super cool and have a lot of potential. However, it's the bitter lesson, I guess, for founders is you really got to work where the demand is on the kind of on the demand side, rather than just build products because you think they're cool.
00:20:53.060 - 00:21:35.164, Speaker A: I think we came out there with the thesis that, hey, it's a multi trillion dollar industry in tradfi, why shouldn't we put this on chain? And then we come to on chain and build it in Defi. And there's just very few people that know or are confident in trading options. And it's also extremely hard to get liquidity because the way options works, instead of a perp, which is like a sole perp, you get a futures, I guess, is the next step. Futures have different expiries, so you'll have Solpurp ending end of July or end of 2020. So suddenly fragmentation into t markets, I guess, for all these different time periods, and then you've got all these strikes for options. So it's like maybe Sol $20 or the Sol dollar 30 or $40 strike. So you've got t times k strikes.
00:21:35.164 - 00:22:00.082, Speaker A: So suddenly we had just for the three markets, BTC, Sol ETH, we were trying to support like 150 independent markets that all had to be market made. So it was just this nightmare for market makers. And then you're having to do it on chain on Solana, where you have like kind of slow round trip times. Like it's still in the couple of hundred milliseconds, which is a ways away from, from what people are used to with binance and their 22nd, like, which.
00:22:00.106 - 00:22:04.786, Speaker B: Is crazy though, compared to other l one s and l two s. But I do agree.
00:22:04.898 - 00:22:40.742, Speaker A: That's right. But so far it works pretty well. Like, the purpose thing is really nice because we've aggregated that liquidity. And to be honest, you saw with serum, like, it was, it was, you know, passing a billion dollars of volume a day back in its peak. We've done tens of millions of volume on our exchange, and it's not broken a sweat, it's done it super easily. And it's really a demand problem of we need more users in Solana because our dex can easily support, I think, ten, probably 100 x more volume than it does now. The infra is really scalable and we've definitely not maxed out or saturated the bandwidth of Solana at the moment.
00:22:40.742 - 00:23:05.274, Speaker A: So that's been going well. I'm pretty excited for that. When you talk about, I guess, competing with binance, there's still maybe some question marks around that. Providing liquidity is the hardest thing on chain right now. People are obviously, the Amm route is very popular. People are doing hybrid amm, orderbook, trying to come up with all this funky stuff, batch auctions, you name it. So we've been exploring other designs.
00:23:05.274 - 00:23:40.932, Speaker A: DyDX is an interesting one. I don't know if you really call that a full decentralized exchange, but they do this hybrid model that obviously scales super well and has the benefits of very fast execution and matching, albeit in a somewhat off chain manner. But then you're doing all the custody of assets, you're doing all the settlement on chains. Everything's transparent. You don't have the rug risk of an FTX. Maybe in the meantime, that is a decent solution or design until these networks get really fast. And I am very hopeful for Fydansa, Fidel will dramatically increase throughput.
00:23:40.932 - 00:23:51.836, Speaker A: And Atolly said they might bring down block times to 200 milliseconds. Now, if that's kind of possible. So that would be huge. Like, you know, you sign starting to get very fast, like hitting up the. The speed of light around the world.
00:23:51.868 - 00:24:23.830, Speaker B: So I think I measured it, ran some calculations, and it was like 133 milliseconds to do a global round trip. And then I think once you get the 200 millisecond block times, if they're able to do introduce multiple leaders, and you can have liters per continent. So maybe you can cut that down again to like 100 milliseconds or less. So definitely interesting. I fully agree. We're kind of just at the tip of what is possible, but I think that's the exciting part.
00:24:23.950 - 00:24:59.366, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And I think there's like, innovation is crazy. I remember seeing Kevin Bowser's talk last year at breakpoint that kind of blew my mind. I'm like this guy who's built literal supercomputers and is now working a jump on these HFT trading systems. They're just optimizing every line of code on this thing. They're going and rewriting networking libraries and stuff, so they can just squeeze every iota of performance out of these things. And I'm like, who's doing this in crypto? Everyone's talking about daos and governance and public goods and all these random things, like, admittedly, ZK and all this kind of stuff is pretty cool as well, but no one is just taking the.
00:24:59.366 - 00:25:06.986, Speaker A: Putting their engineering hat on and just being like, how do we optimize the living crap out of this thing and just make it really, really scalable? So I love that approach.
00:25:07.118 - 00:26:02.186, Speaker B: Tristan, you're leaking too much alpha. I think I saw the fire dancer demo that they did recently in one of their talks, and I think it was doing like four or 5 million tps per core, and it scales linearly. They were doing 20 gigabits worth of traffic and they were saturating the line, which was pretty crazy to me. But yeah, to your point, I think Twitter is very. Likes to follow the, the current thing, and I think Solana is kind of getting its day in light. And I think really that's an attestment to teams like yourself that have really put the blood, sweat and tears through the ups, but also through the painful bear market and through kind of all the stuff that happened to FTX to really get us to the side. So more applaud to you because a network in and of itself is not too useful.
00:26:02.186 - 00:26:38.710, Speaker B: It's really the applications that will ultimately get put on there. So I think, I mean, we kind of touched a little bit upon like DeFi versus C five. I mean, the markets in the Tranfray world are just absolutely massive. You kind of talked about a lesson for founders and particularly being more focused on what users need today. And I think there's kind of a lesson in of that in of itself. But could you maybe just dive a little bit deeper into. I mean, you were talking about ultimately doing perps options were a little bit harder and you're in state of what you want zeta markets to be.
00:26:38.710 - 00:26:43.134, Speaker B: Do you have a global vision of what it could become?
00:26:43.262 - 00:27:23.812, Speaker A: It's a great question. Yeah, I think we focused a lot on the tech in the kind of early days that's still obviously developing. I think I've become very much like a UX and accessibility maxi now. I think just using a lot of these defi products, especially the really good ones, for example, Jupiter. I think the barrier to entry is once you have a wallet, obviously the barrier to entry and the usability is incredible versus centralized exchanges. I simply don't use my binance account or any of these things anymore because it's like I have to log in, I have to two FA, I have to go through their very confusing navigation page and that stuff. I just want to buy SoL or whatever it might be, buy some ethereum.
00:27:23.812 - 00:27:49.676, Speaker A: It's really a bit of a pain. And I just think a lot of the designs have been stuck in 2018, so it's really good to see new blood in there, especially with Defi. The UX has admittedly been pretty bad to date for a lot of Defi apps. The first one is just the fact that most chains have been super slow and people just haven't experienced what it is to have a fast, super cheap chain. People don't.
00:27:49.708 - 00:27:54.496, Speaker B: They kind of a connect to dial up to broadband and then fibromyalgia.
00:27:54.668 - 00:27:56.024, Speaker A: That's right, that's right.
00:27:56.192 - 00:28:13.288, Speaker B: It's like when you're trying to dial into AOL the first time, you just were like, all right, I'm waiting, I'm waiting. And then finally you get online versus broadband and fiber optics. I mean, you hit the button and it's almost like the transaction pretty much confirms instantaneously.
00:28:13.384 - 00:28:36.590, Speaker A: That's right. Yeah. Not to, I guess, dunk on ethereum, but the first time, I think I did on chain transactions and like, had a self custody walleth a bunch of years ago when I was still, like, a poor uni student, I went through there and I just tried to do a swap on uniswap and the gas fees were so high. I'm like, wow. It's like, I don't know, $1020 or something other. I'm like, for me, that's actually a lot of money. And it's just very annoying.
00:28:36.590 - 00:28:59.312, Speaker A: Every single interaction I do, I have to approve some kind of balance or this or that or spend limit. It kind of eats into the $100 swap that you wanted to do. It's just gone at that point. And it takes like minutes to confirm my wallet. And I'm like, oh, this isn't that fun. And then my light bulb moment with Solana is just like, we were setting up our stuff. I needed to pay someone as like a contractor.
00:28:59.312 - 00:29:12.928, Speaker A: I just sent them USDC. It was confirmed in like 3 seconds, probably. And I paid basically like a rounding error in fees. And I'm like, okay, this feels like the future. Like, this is pretty cool. Yeah, we're trying to definitely.
00:29:13.024 - 00:29:49.228, Speaker B: The latency definitely helps. I mean, but to your point, like earlier, I definitely agree. I think the UI UX is cumbersome or can be cumbersome. Even just setting up wallets can be a little bit of a challenge. Onboarding into an exchange just to be able to get your money off kind of a centralized exchange into like, the defi landscape can be hard. If there was any particular pain points out of those or others that you think is the biggest thing kind of holding back the industry, what do you think that would be?
00:29:49.324 - 00:30:24.296, Speaker A: Oh, it's a good question. I think number one is probably just liquidity. It's hard to trade on these on chain exchanges just because of the latency and the fact that all these kind of regular market makers need to completely rewrite their stack to worry about soft forks and things like that. It's pretty difficult. Hopefully, more and more people you're seeing, I think, getting familiar with this, deploying on chain strategies, stuff like that solved problem. And I know given traders, if there's money there, they will, you know, they will go over there and they will build the systems if there's money to be made. So not too worried about that.
00:30:24.296 - 00:31:03.508, Speaker A: Long term, I think wallets are the other big one. It's just, like, pretty painful, I think, for people to deal with seed phrases and set up these things. Like, I've hung out with a bunch of my normal non crypto friends, and I've been like, hey, you want to onboard and test out our product? And then I'm like, I have to go through the mental cycles of, okay, you need to get like a phantom or backpack or soulflare wallet. You know, choose which one you want. You got to store your seed phrase and write that down on a piece of paper. Then you got to on ramp, so you got to get a centralized exchange, or you got to go through some, like, fiat on ramp, you know, decentralized one, which, you know, takes a clip on, you know, whatever you're kind of on ramping there. Or I need to send you money.
00:31:03.508 - 00:31:32.686, Speaker A: So now you've got money in your account. You need a log into the thing. You need to sign some transactions, you need to open accounts. It's a bit of a painful process, I got to say. So I'm looking forward to things like gasless transactions will be pretty cool, or where you can pay them in USCC or any kind of other tokens. Something that we're trying to solve right now is the fact that you got to sign every single transaction when you interact with the defi app. So I guess that goes to what's all the rage now on Ethereum, which is account abstraction.
00:31:32.686 - 00:31:56.986, Speaker A: And Solana has more or less had this for a couple of years. So we're trying to do stuff like potentially, like, ephemeral session keys. So if you needed to pause and withdraw into our exchange, you would sign for it. But if you just want to place trades under a certain kind of amount, you just wouldn't have to sign for it. We'd be able to figure out ways, hopefully securely, that people can trade without this kind of friction. And this is a big one. Like, someone comes from a centralized exchange or they're from, like, a trading firm.
00:31:56.986 - 00:32:05.622, Speaker A: They're like, man, I saw the price flash off on the order book. I wanted to grab it, and I had to this wallet pops up, I got to sign it. I got to do all these things. Uh, is kind of painful.
00:32:05.726 - 00:33:10.710, Speaker B: Yeah. On the, on the market making side, I do think it's interesting just talking with now quite a few different amms and also, uh, people that are building order books. Uh, I think the entire trading world and definitely in the tradfi world, is really centered around, uh, order books and the ability to market make. And we've had years and years of teams that have put a lot of energy and effort, engineering prowess into understanding how to market make, kind of routing toxic flow versus non toxic flow and all of that. How do you feel like, on the market making side, building things on chain? I think you kind of mentioned it a little bit. It's a little bit harder because they have to kind of either rewrite their systems or just understand the crypto world. When you're talking with potential market makers, do you feel like they're kind of grasping kind of either the crypto landscape, or do you feel like they're trying to shoehorn their old systems into the crypto world?
00:33:10.790 - 00:33:44.048, Speaker A: Yeah, it really depends, I think, on the size of the firm. I think we probably somewhat made a mistake trying to work with the big name firms off the bat. And these guys, obviously, you know, they're pretty well off. I think they're just looking for opportunities to make money. They're across, like, hundreds of changes, so theyre a bit less willing to put in the time and effort to integrate and build something that really works. And I think it is a much more democratized playing ground when you come to defi, essentially anyone can deploy. You dont have to worry about colocation and all these tricks that HFT market makers have up their sleeves.
00:33:44.048 - 00:34:22.556, Speaker A: So I was talking to one of the better market makers on the Solana side, and, yeah, his background, hes coming to market making, and hes already kind of picking off jump on Openbook and stuff like that, which is pretty impressive that a single guy can kind of compete with big trading firms on these on chain order books. And I think, to your point, yeah, a lot of these big firms are kind of complacent. They come in there, theyre like, heres our trading stack. Heres our risk management system. We just kind of wrap it in the SDK that the Dex has provided us, and we just call it a day. And that usually isnt super successful. You saw teams like Alameda, I think, as well, probably trying to market make hundreds of projects.
00:34:22.556 - 00:35:10.814, Speaker A: Back in the Solana early days, they were losing money on serum and all these other exchanges, because they just didn't invest, I think, the kind of technical expertise and develop their systems any further. They just kind of market made at a loss. But you're seeing more people now, I think, coming in there, independent people, smaller shops that are super hungry and actually doing really well on chain. And they're looking at this, I feel like a different race going on. It's not like, how do we have the lowest latency? How do we build FPGA's and build these kind of really low latency systems and co locate it and put in the same position? It's like now you're dealing with fixed blocks, essentially. You're thinking about Mev and these other kinds of things that happen on chain. You're starting to look at Jito and how you can bundle transactions and do funky stuff there, cross exchange, atomic arbitrage, all these super cool things.
00:35:10.814 - 00:35:18.628, Speaker A: So, yeah, hopefully the tooling gets a bit better and people get more comfortable, but I think there's definitely opportunity there, and I'm hoping more people get involved.
00:35:18.734 - 00:35:59.432, Speaker B: Yeah, it is super interesting. I mean, you have to. The things that you really have to kind of understand on a deep level is pretty, pretty high, as you mentioned, like the block space, just MeV bundling your transactions. It is a high hurdle. But I think this industry that's really being created by you, the team, the Solana ecosystem, will bring new players into the market that may have not had a chance, that can kind of remake themselves in a more crypto native way, which I think is truly exciting.
00:35:59.536 - 00:36:00.472, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely.
00:36:00.576 - 00:37:03.564, Speaker B: It's a wild space. I think just being so early, you can kind of make, you have the opportunity to really kind of make the space where you want. And I think you and the Zeta team are really kind of a testament to that. I think there is slight kind of like uphill battle to acquiring users, especially, I think, on the Defi side, just because of some of the issues that we've kind of mentioned with either higher latencies compared to the Tradfi world, or just understanding different markets, how they work. I think today, if you ask kind of the crypto native person what Solano is used for, and they'll predominantly say nfts, which I think are great in the form of getting that community or organic traction started, but then it has to continue into real world applications. DeFi being one of those games being one of those. What do you think will further crypto adoption outside of the DeFi lens?
00:37:03.652 - 00:37:36.702, Speaker A: That's a great question. That's probably been top of mind for the last year. For me, building in a bear market, I think it's all about how do you grow adoption. And I think our tech stack got kind of pretty mature over that time. And it's like, how much more can you innovate on chain? And how much do people care about tweaking little aspects of your order book and cranking out every little piece of performance? At a certain point, it really doesn't matter, I don't think. And so, yeah, it was tough building on Solana, especially during that kind of defi bear. It went from the original vision that we got bought into where Anatolia was.
00:37:36.702 - 00:38:02.460, Speaker A: Like, we're building Nasdaq on chain. This is the future. And suddenly DJ and apes and all these NFT projects started popping off. And then it turns out, hey, it's mostly retail people using this chain because it's fast and cheap. Nfts are the hot thing that became the new narrative is nfts are big. And I think Solana put a lot of its weight behind that. And Defi just kind of got left on the sidelines a bit, just like, where's our support? And everyone kind of migrated over to the NFT side.
00:38:02.460 - 00:38:18.600, Speaker A: It was really hot with all these exchanges going crazy. But then I think nfts have been cool. I think they'll stick around for a long time. The hype's kind of died down a little bit. And people are like, okay, made all this money. What do I do with it? Can I put my capital to work? And it comes back to Defi again. Same with gaming.
00:38:18.600 - 00:38:57.834, Speaker A: I'm sure if you have in game economies, you need defi, you need ways to utilize these tokens, lend them, trade them. And so it's been tough being on, I guess, somewhat of a NFT chain or what's ended up being a bit of an NFT chain versus looking at things like arbitrum, where you have all the gmxs and big perp platforms, and these guys kind of killing it. They have all these whales on Eth that have just bridged probably billions of dollars in there. They're placing massive trades. You really don't see that in Solana at the moment. I think all the whales that are there tend to be NFT people. And so that was kind of our working hypothesis going into building this mad wars campaign experience.
00:38:57.834 - 00:39:42.132, Speaker A: Essentially, we were like, where's the capital in Solana? We crunch some numbers and we're like, it seems like a lot of these big value players either have their money staked, they're probably a vc. So they just have big sole bags that are staked and not productive, not used. Hopefully g two sol and liquid staking kind of solves that a bit. And then you have NfT people who are just putting a lot of this money into nfts. You don't tend to have these defi whales because I don't think there were many good yield opportunities on Solana, admittedly, over the last year. So we launched this mad wars competition. We were like, how do we tap into the NFT crowd? How do we get them trading or kind of engage that part of Solana that is actually completely disjoint? I think from the Defi side, you talk to these NFT people and they're like, I don't know any of the Defi projects.
00:39:42.132 - 00:40:12.632, Speaker A: I don't use them. It's just completely alien to me. I don't know if that's because they came in during that NFT boom, after the defi boom, and they just missed it completely. Maybe it's not even on their radar. So the TLDR on what we built was like a social trading comp, like you're used to with like a binance leaderboard. You know, you're ranked on your p and l, say, but we made it. We kind of put an interesting twist on it, which is, if you've minted this mad lad, which is this kind of a, like, NFT collection built by, you know, Armani and Tristan, really popular people love it.
00:40:12.632 - 00:40:37.564, Speaker A: It's got, like a die hard fan base of, you know, a couple of thousand holders. It's awesome. Based on the trait you have, say, if you're in the skulls or the galaxies or all these different ones, we basically place you in a team, and we aggregate these teams, and we look at the team p and l, as well as the individual p and L. So there's this social effect, or this network effect where people in the skulls are like, we need to trade together. We need to build up our p and l. We need to beat the galaxies. Screw those guys.
00:40:37.564 - 00:40:57.582, Speaker A: We need to beat them on the leaderboard. And so people are coming in there. It's a really good vibe. People are getting in the discord. People are talking about trading strategies together, and it makes defi and trading a lot more social. And that's kind of the issue I've had with trading, is it's very much a single player game, if you want to phrase it from the gamification perspective. You come in there, put a bit of money in, you trade.
00:40:57.582 - 00:41:24.894, Speaker A: It's very isolated. Either you make or you lose money, you withdraw it, end of story. Whereas now you're seeing with Twitter, I think it's pretty cool. People post charts, people discuss strategies. It's actually got a big social element. The more that we can integrate that into the product through leaderboards or gamification, or we even added a discord, trollbox or chat so people can actually talk within the app about their trading strategies. That's been really good for retention and just getting more people bought in.
00:41:24.982 - 00:42:21.680, Speaker B: Yeah, it is fascinating how many people have really got into trading and I don't know. I'm sure there is a large trading community outside of crypto, but it seems that really, the global nature of crypto, combined with vast majority of things, ultimately have tokens, has really brought together the trading community in a way that I haven't seen before. And like you said, kind of either posting tweets or discords or these group chats, the trading communities are really vibrant. And I do think going forward, just that social feature and kind of being able to spot things earlier than others, that trend will only continue as kind of, the world becomes more financialized. And so rather ingenious to start incorporating some of those features now.
00:42:21.800 - 00:43:01.812, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, the kind of vision for us, or the vision, what I was thinking was, you have this, you see social media and you see apps like Robinhood and kind of financial stuff, and I think seeing this slight convergence with how people are adding crypto payments into Twitter or other applications, and I think eventually, like, they will start to converge. You've obviously got web3 social media. I've been using, like, Farcaster and lens a little bit and playing around with that. I think that would be really nice if you were able to kind of, like, meld those two worlds together. You have a timeline, you know, Anselm goes up there and he's like, this is my kind of ta for bitcoin. I reckon it's going to rip at.
00:43:01.812 - 00:43:37.706, Speaker A: You have a link or some kind of on chain functionality that you can copy his trade directly in your favorite Dex or something like that. You can start trading it and then you have a nice effect there where we can do revenue share. So whoever they copied the trade from or got the idea from, if the guy profits off that trade, we give them a 5% rebate back. And so these influencers or these kind of social media personalities can actually make a living off doing trade signals, and it actually incentivizes them to be profitable, because then they make a their followers, money. The good ones get paid more. And then hopefully it's like a reinforcing thing. But that feels pretty novel.
00:43:37.706 - 00:43:41.962, Speaker A: I don't know who's done that. I think some people are trying, but yeah, it still feels early.
00:43:42.106 - 00:44:22.166, Speaker B: It's definitely early. And I mean, even regards kind of to the liquidity aspect, I think people often forget. I mean, I was around and stuck around after 2017 throughout the bear market for Ethereum. And Ethereum CVL was very tiny. I remember watching it cross a billion and thinking like, holy shit, this is wild. And it obviously ballooned. But I think a lot of that was just the general wealth effect that Ethereum had from Ethereum itself, going from $80 to 4000 to the 2000 or 1800 where it sits at now.
00:44:22.166 - 00:45:00.734, Speaker B: And I fully expect Solana to have a similar wealth effect wherever these whales will be in the Solana ecosystem. And it's really built throughout that hardship. And so there's a growing community. It's great to see people interact with things on chain, whether it's DeFi or nfts. And I only expect that to continue to grow. And I think that's the thing that I'm generally the most excited about. I mean, when I came into the crypto ecosystem is anybody like yourself could ultimately build any of these protocols.
00:45:00.734 - 00:45:39.064, Speaker B: It's cheap relatively, to kind of building rockets or buying a bunch of AI chips for compute. You could just write it in your studio apartment and anybody could ultimately access it. And then that code could be deployed and used by hundreds of millions and ultimately billions of people. And when you have that level of scale and the open innovation, I think that's where you start to really see something magical happen. And I think truly the foundation is currently being laid. So the bull market, next bull market will be very fun.
00:45:39.152 - 00:46:13.258, Speaker A: That's right. Yeah, that's what blew my mind. With a lot of this blockchain technology, especially these kind of newer chains like Solana, you just have this incredible resource of write a bit of code, deploy this smart contract. It kind of runs on this distributed network of 2000 computers. You don't have to worry about AWS or the hosting or anything, and then it just syncs state around the world. So you have this one ledger ground truth, and you just worry about the application code, like how you're sending and receiving transfers and accounting for balances. You don't have to worry about anything under the hood.
00:46:13.258 - 00:46:42.828, Speaker A: So I think it's great for new devs to get in there and start writing smart contracts and building applications. It's pretty incredible. Resource. And then I think the thing with this bull market is now block space is hopefully going to be abundant. Solana has fixed a lot of the throughput issues. Ethereum is moving to this kind of roll up centric roadmap where I think a lot of these new chains, arbitrum, optimism or whatever, will be able to have. It's a bit of a meme, but these l three s and app chains and whatever, so you can really parameterize it and customize it however you want.
00:46:42.828 - 00:47:02.676, Speaker A: So I don't think we're going to have these, like, cryptokitty moments where, you know, the entire block space of the l one is saturated and you can't have these massive consumer apps, you know, just bringing down chains. And, you know, maybe we'll see something that truly scales to millions of users, you know, or like tens of millions, hundreds of millions this cycle, which I'd be really excited for.
00:47:02.748 - 00:47:24.458, Speaker B: Likewise. I 100% agree. I think to that point, I mean, we've talked to a little bit about some other chains. What's kind of your view set as an engineer on some of the tribalism in the space? What's your view on kind of choosing one l one or l two versus another?
00:47:24.594 - 00:47:49.776, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. I mean, from a builder perspective, I think you really want to just choose the tools that get the job done the best. Like, I think that makes perfect sense. If you're a product, you know, you're too rational. Yeah, exactly. You choose the kind of tech stack and the software technology that gets the job done and lets you build the best product. I try and be product first as much as I can, where it's like, this is the vision for what I want to build.
00:47:49.776 - 00:48:21.410, Speaker A: Let's choose the chain, the technology, all the design choices based around that to fulfill that. At the time that we started, it was definitely Solana for that stuff. We're seeing a lot of new innovation coming up. I'm trying to keep abreast of that. I've been to my first ETH conference. It's interesting to talk to a lot of these people and figure out a what they're building. I try and be very conscious that I'm not narrow minded and in the kind of the tunnel of Solana, tunnel vision, and not being able to see what else is out there.
00:48:21.410 - 00:49:00.466, Speaker A: But I think also the systemic problem that crypto and crypto builders and projects and whatever have is this short termism where it's like, new chain comes up, it's like, okay, free money, we're going to get grants, we're going to be able to go to new chain. Let's just take our EVM smart contract and let's redeploy it on new EVM compatible chain. And I'm not really like a fan of that. I think that's just like not a great way to build a sustainable ecosystem. It's like, let's just jump on the new hot thing, let's get a bunch of users, let's pump the TVL up. And then it's the same old product again that we've just rehashed. Once the incentives dry up, boom, you're kind of back to square one again, which is not that interesting.
00:49:00.466 - 00:49:28.392, Speaker A: And you've seen this happen kind of over and over, but it's good to see, hopefully, especially with the builders on Solana, they've been around for two years, a lot of them have stuck it out. People are starting to innovate. More stuff is picking up. Likewise with Ethereum. People have stuck to their guns there. At least on Ethereum, I think the new roll ups that are popping up there, you don't need too many changes to your smart contract, so it really unlocks a bit more innovation for them there. But I think end of the day, there shouldn't be so much tribalism.
00:49:28.392 - 00:49:51.240, Speaker A: I think there naturally is, because you have bags in whatever it is. Whereas if you're in web two, you're not like AWS bag holder. It's actually like a, it's like a bad thing, right? Like the, the lock in they give you, they're like, here's your one hundred k of credits. Come use AWS or GCP, come in there, lock in your system, and then you can't move anywhere. But in crypto people. Like, they're like, I'm the arbitrary maxi, I'm the Solana Maxi. You know, this is my chain.
00:49:51.240 - 00:50:09.290, Speaker A: I'm gonna like, defend it on Twitter. It is kind of good. You need, you need some spokespeople, right? And some people to stand up and like, explain the technology. But I, some people, I think just, you know, they go a bit too hard where they're like, I won't listen to whatever else is happening and like, this is the true vision and everyone else is wrong, which I'm not a fan of.
00:50:09.670 - 00:51:15.048, Speaker B: I truly believe that everybody ultimately sees the promise of the technology and everybody knows that there hasn't been that like breakout app that has been like really gone to kind of mainstream adoption, kind of like fortnite levels or chat GPT, where it's just like, holy shit, like, this is happening. And it's what everybody's talking about, and it's kind of a race, and everybody's trying to either vie for engineers or eyeballs or VC dollars. And I think in general, people are pretty good at kind of grabbing attention. I think truly, though, the thing that's ultimately going to separate them is the engineering ability to actually scale, and then for engineers to effectively utilize that scale to build something that can actually enhance people's lives from the product perspective. And I think as soon as that happens, there will be less tribalism, because people will be like, oh, shit, like, this is actually taking off. I want my application to be used. I'm going to build on that chain.
00:51:15.144 - 00:51:44.096, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And I think at the end of the day, that should all be abstracted from the user, whether you're on chain a or chain b, I guess it's important, but it's also so like an implementation detail. And if you look at something that's like, some of the ones that are more successful, I would say things like, stepn was pretty fun to use in the day, even though they kind of, like, custodied your assets somewhat and they provisioned you. The wallet, like, that was a much nicer ux. And I think if they didn't do that, they probably wouldn't have got nearly the success that they would have had. If it was like, bring your own Phantom wallet and do this. And that.
00:51:44.096 - 00:51:59.722, Speaker A: People would have been like, God, what is this? This is, like, too confusing. But they hid that. It's just like an app that you download on the app store. You do a bit of running, you own these tokens, and you kind of move on with your life. And I don't think half the users on there even knew what Solana was or how to use it.
00:51:59.786 - 00:52:27.514, Speaker B: No, it was remarkable, and I was impressed just how many users they were actually able to obtain, but no. Fascinating world. I think ultimately, it just highlights that we are early. There's a lot of green grass, a lot of room to build. Kind of looking forward to either the rest of this year or into 2024. Are there anything particular that you are either looking forward on the Zeta side or just within crypto, more broadly?
00:52:27.602 - 00:52:52.794, Speaker A: Great question. On the zeta side, yeah, we've been super heads down building through this bear market and just reducing tech debt and trying to build new features. So things have been tiny bit quiet, but starting to get a bit louder, which is good. And it's well timed, I guess, with the Solana comeback. So we're deploying our v two in a couple of weeks from now, which is pretty exciting. Cross margin. We completely rewrote our smart contract, so it's kind of a lot more efficient now.
00:52:52.794 - 00:53:07.090, Speaker A: Like, all our order matching is a lot better. All this kind of stuff that I guess people don't care about, but it's really nice when you use it. And then we rewrote our whole front end, so it's like, way, way faster. Redesigned. It just looks a lot better. So I'm very excited for that. We've just been doing.
00:53:07.090 - 00:53:35.200, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks. We've been doing a bit of a beta rollout, and so far, like, the feedback has been really positive and people have been enjoying that. So continuing to grow market share, bring more people in and start getting them trading. I'm very excited for that. More broadly, I guess we want to see how can we compete with centralized exchanges, win market share from that. So thinking designs around there. There's been a lot more innovation, I guess, on how to tap into the multi chain network.
00:53:35.200 - 00:54:04.858, Speaker A: I've seen people talking about integrations with metamask and bridges seem to be improving with every month that passes. I'm very excited for that to start being a thing, because it's annoying being isolated on this chain and there's no liquidity to bridge, and you got to start new wallets and stuff like that. That's been a bit tough. Otherwise. I'm keen to see this defi revival. I think it's been a long time in the making, not just on Solana. Across the whole ecosystems, nfts have had the limelight.
00:54:04.858 - 00:54:45.670, Speaker A: Gaming had its very short limelight moment, and I think Defi is back on Solana. I think it's going to be driven a lot by this LST adoption, which would be really cool. More people hopefully taking their money out of this staking stuff and actually getting the liquid staking token, putting it back into defi. There's a lot of capital locked up there that I think can be used a lot better. And I think the products are really starting to mature very quickly, so it'll be fun. And even I'm not deploying that much of my personal capital into all these yield strategies. So I'm looking back, you know, looking forward to getting back into, you know, farming and doing all this kind of fun stuff and seeing this kind of flywheel get going again.
00:54:45.750 - 00:54:48.518, Speaker B: Solana Summer 2.0. Let's run it back. Exactly.
00:54:48.614 - 00:54:49.490, Speaker A: Hell yeah.
00:54:49.910 - 00:55:20.502, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, it was a really fun conversation. Tristan. Really appreciate kind of diving into the nuance of Zeta, what you and the team are ultimately building there. Congrats on the upcoming product launch. I know it's no small feat from the engineering side, and really appreciate you kind of diving into some of the different technical aspects, whether that be Zeta itself, the derivative markets perpetuals, some of the stuff with options. Also the Solana architecture.
00:55:20.502 - 00:55:25.230, Speaker B: I think people are really going to enjoy the conversation. So thank you so much for coming on the podcast.
00:55:25.350 - 00:55:26.430, Speaker A: Not at all. Thanks for having me.
