00:00:00.280 - 00:00:14.318, Speaker A: What was different about crypto in particular was just how low the bar was, right? There were no designers at all. It didn't feel like anyone cared about actually translating what is this really revolutionary and exciting technology into something that was actually relevant.
00:00:14.494 - 00:00:19.130, Speaker B: As I recall, it felt almost sinful to build on anything other than Ethereum.
00:00:19.790 - 00:00:20.638, Speaker C: That's still true.
00:00:20.694 - 00:01:03.570, Speaker B: I mean, there's probably going to be in a debate forever about Amms versus order books today. I'm super excited to be joined by Ori and Yutaro, both really founders that are OG in the space. So I'm really looking forward to this podcast, founders of Orca. So I think this is really going to be a great conversation on the beginnings of why Solana, why Defi and Solana, why they chose to make this kind of their home, and then some kind of diving into future products that they're going to announce. So, really looking forward to this podcast and excited to chat with both of you.
00:01:04.350 - 00:01:05.630, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:01:05.790 - 00:01:07.330, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:01:08.150 - 00:01:43.630, Speaker B: Well, I would love, I mean, maybe just a quick intro on each of you, if you could, and then jump into Yutara, I know you were previously at the ETH foundation, so a little bit about why you decided to build on Solana at the point in time that you did, because I think at that point in time, as I recall, it felt like, almost sinful to build on anything other than Ethereum. That's not true. I would love, from your point of view, why you took the risk on this new infrastructure, this new chain, and how the experience has been thus far.
00:01:44.690 - 00:01:54.726, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's definitely interesting to hear someone say that I'm an OG because it feels like I just joined a few years ago, but I suppose that's a.
00:01:54.758 - 00:01:55.558, Speaker A: That's crypto, man.
00:01:55.614 - 00:01:57.926, Speaker C: Yeah, that's how fast crypto moves.
00:01:58.038 - 00:01:59.862, Speaker B: It does move quickly, yeah.
00:01:59.886 - 00:02:30.122, Speaker C: I mean, happy to talk about kind of our backgrounds, you know, like you mentioned, I initially started off in the Ethereum world. It was around late 2017. I was looking for. I was basically looking for what is the most interesting thing going on in crypto. Initially, I thought it was kind of the bitcoin lightning networks, because that had a lot of hype at the time. Started looking into it. It wasn't really clear how I could contribute.
00:02:30.122 - 00:03:25.788, Speaker C: And then basically, I was in Tokyo at the time, went to an ETH meetup, met all the folks there. I was really inspired by them, started looking into ETH two, which was just getting started at the time, started contributing, and then it kind of just snowballed from there. Ultimately, I decided I was a contributor for the Golang version of the ETH two validator, which was with the folks at prismatic labs. Had a great time there, learned a lot, and then that kind of one thing led to another, I suppose. I had also spent time on the application side, building out a Defi protocol called Uma with heart in New York. That was also a great experience. And then I had also, after that, spent some time on kind of L2 prototyping.
00:03:25.788 - 00:03:50.542, Speaker C: You know, this is before kind of optimism was a thing, when people were still kind of trying to figure out what is the ideal construction for these L2s that people are just kind of only starting to theorize. And then that was kind of like the prelude that led us to start working on Solana and seeing kind of the opportunity that Solana provided, and happy to talk more about that later as well.
00:03:50.726 - 00:04:01.250, Speaker B: Perfect. And ori, yeah, I would love to learn a little bit more about your backstory as well, like how you two came together and ultimately built what is now today orca.
00:04:01.550 - 00:05:02.786, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. First, I would say that Yutara really sells himself short in terms of his background. An industry trained software engineer by background originally, but just saw the potential in crypto, I think, really early on as kind of like a geek for math, for economics, for finance, and for cryptography. And you put all these things together and you get crypto. And so he pretty much just, like, quit his job into a, you know, halfway into a promising career and decided to just study crypto full time, which is how he ended up at those meetups and ended up at the Ethereum foundation. So that definitely gives us as a founding duo that crypto background. Whereas for me, I come from, like, the complete opposite of, I would say, extreme crypto skeptic, actually, like, spent pretty much most of my career until Orca doing what I would say, I kind of fondly joke is, like, the goody two shoes thing, right? Like, working in ed tech, working on, like, nonprofit projects, working on impact projects for Ideo, and then pretty much also had a software background mixed with design.
00:05:02.786 - 00:06:00.680, Speaker A: So went to Stanford, studied computer science, study human computer interaction, was just kind of out there trying to see how I could put those things together and ended up specializing and really doing human centered design for highly technical systems and trying to apply that in whatever the most impactful way possible was. And so that's kind of how I ended up in Tokyo back in, like, 2018, 2019, working for Ido Tokyo, doing projects, working across Asia. And it was during that time that I ended up actually meeting Yutaro. And this is pretty much just when Covid happened. Pretty much, like, moved into a co living, co working house for entrepreneur type vibe. Wasn't really looking to start anything at the time, but just kind of, we met, pandemic happened, things locked down, everyone got kind of bored, and we're like, I'm a builder, you're a builder. Should we build something on the side? And before we knew it, suddenly I was deep in the world of crypto.
00:06:00.680 - 00:06:16.310, Speaker A: And I think that combination of our skill sets and also of our interest ended up allowing us to build something that was actually quite unique in that it really built on these deep crypto principles, but with, I think, a little bit more soul and focus on user experience than the average product.
00:06:16.850 - 00:07:14.670, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah. I mean, I got fairly familiar with orca and their product even prior to, like, the first breakpoint event, but I was lucky enough to attend one of your events. I don't know if I was lucky enough to speak with both of you at the event, but got invited to event and just met the awesome team and was super inspired what you were building. I think that first breakpoint was really kind of a rallying point for the Solana community to meet everybody in person and get to chat with everybody. But I think one thing that really stood out to me was Orca's point of view on just making things much more simplistic than they have in the past and touching upon studying design, studying human interaction with the software. Could you touch upon that component as well? Because I feel like Orca really goes beyond, beyond the other amms in the space.
00:07:15.570 - 00:08:00.814, Speaker A: It was never my intent to redesign crypto for people. I think it's just something that, again, naturally evolved. I think so much of our story is really organic in that way. It's something I love about it. But, yeah, I mean, I started out my career, like I mentioned, really, as just run of the mill software engineer, I would say. And it was actually after building lots of products over my time working at primarily startups that never really had product market fit, that caused me to get frustrated with that process and to really take a step back and say, okay, what is it that I want to work on? And I realized that what I wanted to work on was earlier in the funnel, making sure that the products that we were actually building were the right ones to actually solve problems for people. And when we came to crypto, I think that perspective was no different.
00:08:00.814 - 00:08:23.970, Speaker A: I had a little more experience actually doing it. But what was different about crypto in particular was just how low the bar was, right? There were no designers at all. It didn't feel like anyone cared about actually translating what is this really revolutionary and exciting technology into something that was actually relevant and usable. And so I was like, okay, I'm not an expert on the tech, but this is where I can come in and provide some value.
00:08:24.540 - 00:09:16.340, Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah, no, it makes a lot of sense, I think. I mean, there are definitely today still exists a lot of technical challenges for the space, but I mean, it's been forefront from the beginning that design is something that always needs love and still needs much love. And so I think, or really separates itself from the pack, from that front. Yutaro, I would love for you to go in a little bit more. I mean, just being involved with the Ethereum community so heavily, to share some of your insights on why both of you were kind of decided to build in the Solana ecosystem, which was new, kind of really untested at the time, and early to this new ecosystem. What kind of brought you to, or what technical things about the ecosystem got you excited to build here?
00:09:17.160 - 00:10:32.360, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. So I think kind of one relevant article that's been making the rounds recently was, I believe it was an article called roll ups aren't real. And it does a deep dive of kind of how roll ups work and what are the different kind of trade offs that one can make in order to create a more complete design. There is also, I believe, a talk maybe at ETH Denver by Kelvin from optimism that I think it was called ZK roll ups aren't real. And it kind of had a lot of the same themes. After reading that, I think for me it actually kind of reminded me of why for me, Solana makes a lot of sense, and why it's clear that there is a place for Solana in the crypto ecosystem. And in a nutshell, the way I would describe it is that the mainline strategy for Ethereum for scaling and onboarding new users is this like let's have an l, one that is incredibly stable but is not high throughput, and then let's build these kind of like L2 constructions on top of it, whether it be optimistic rollups or ZK rollups.
00:10:32.360 - 00:11:42.354, Speaker C: And that is how we're kind of going to get to onboarding a billion users. And I think that there are a lot of good reasons for this design. One primarily is that it kind of assuming that the Ethereum mainnet is stable, it provides kind of a solid foundation. But then it's also fairly clear once you really dig into kind of the construction and kind of the weaknesses in construction that it takes a very opinionated view of kind of different trade offs that can be made. If you kind of look at the full range of trade offs that can be made for, you know, scaling a smart contract blockchain and hopefully onboarding more users, it's incredibly clear that there are a lot of other valid kind of routes that you can take in order to do this. And Solana is, I think if you look at kind of the design of Solana, it's a very valid way of scaling kind of a blockchain. It's also kind of difficult to kind of tease out the fundamentals from the narrative.
00:11:42.354 - 00:13:00.360, Speaker C: Of course, like Solana at this point has a huge narrative problem, and then it also has kind of real issues when it comes to the network halting and how difficult it is to onboard users when there's kind of this real risk of the network halting. But then, despite that, when you kind of look at the fundamentals. Yeah, it's basically kind of what, what I've observed is that Ethereum is quite good at a lot of things, but then when it comes to what is it not incredibly good at? Well, I would say that the EVM was kind of way ahead of its time, but it's also kind of a far from perfect virtual machine for processing kind of transactions. And then the networking layer also kind of like ahead of its time. But if you kind of consider what the state of the art is for consensus protocols, it's clearly kind of not as good as it's far from kind of like theoretically optimal. And then when I see kind of Solana and the design and also the team and the experience that the team has, it kind of has a lot of these strengths that Ethereum doesn't have.
00:13:00.790 - 00:14:03.650, Speaker B: Definitely. I mean, prior to really me going full time in the space and kind of understanding the small nuances of the blockchain architecture, I would definitely paint myself squarely as an Ethereum, Maxi. And I think I definitely applaud Ethereum and all the research that you did and other people in the past, I think they've just ultimately have chosen for a different set of constraints, which I don't necessarily think is bad. But Solana has definitely taken a different approach. And by allowing cheapest possible cost to users, high throughput, low latency, you're able to build much more interesting applications. And so I applaud you and the team for taking the bet on Solana early, because I remember even talking about other layer ones was, let alone building on them, must have been a hard choice at the time. So I guess, like, I mean, specifically focus on DeFi.
00:14:03.650 - 00:14:18.330, Speaker B: Could you maybe both of you, like, just recant a little bit more about the origin story and how Orca ultimately came to be? Why Defi and ultimately, how did you get started with this amm model?
00:14:19.950 - 00:15:18.190, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, I mean, I guess if we tell the full story, the two of us, again, we pretty much started by just, like, hacking on side projects purely for fun. We were building on Ethereum, and at the time, I joked that Utara was an eth maxi. But coming in from the outside, I think the whole this chain maxi, that chainmax y narrative kind of defeats the purpose of what we're all trying to do here. If I was looking at an analogy almost back from engineering world, when I used to be a front end engineer, you would pick the best framework to build a particular application. Right? And so back in the day, it was like jquery, and then we had backbone, and then later on we had react, and then we. There's definitely some people who resisted moving over, but at the end of the day, you picked the right technology for the job, and most of the people will naturally migrate to the better technology. But what's different about crypto is that people have bags to show and, like, bags to protect.
00:15:18.190 - 00:16:01.536, Speaker A: And I think if people didn't have bags to protect, we'd be looking at a very different technological landscape. Maybe it's like an incendiary point of view, but coming in as an outsider is like, why are people so concerned about this chain versus that chain, as opposed to advancing? What I think is, we should all be smart contract maxis. We should be picking the technology that best allows us to advance that. But in any case, we were building these side projects. We actually ended up getting into this incubator, which is totally online, run by Mozilla, and one of their focuses was crypto, and we were building out a little application on top of Ethereum for that, and actually did build out a working mvp. It was sort of this passive yield generation app. It was very cute.
00:16:01.536 - 00:16:40.170, Speaker A: We called it Wallaroo. People actually did have a couple thousand dollars of deposits in our beta, but that was pretty much when Defi Summer was also blowing up, and I was, at the time, still very starry eyed. Like, let's help. Unbanked people in developing countries use this app, and they can deposit like $10 at a time as they get their paychecks. I was like, okay, well, gas fees are like $50 on Ethereum, this isn't going to work. And so I think this is when we took a step back and we're like, all right, well, if Ethereum's not going to scale just on its own, what will allow the dream of smart contracts to scale? And I'd say that's the first step in what led us to Solana.
00:16:40.990 - 00:17:23.810, Speaker C: Yeah. Another component of that is maybe this is not kind of a, an interesting story per se, but quite simply, I just love the amm kind of design. It captures a lot of what makes crypto so interesting. One of it is, first of all, kind of the original Uniswap V one contract. It's so simple and it's shocking. Kind of like how few lines of code is involved in kind of the smart contract itself. And then also the other thing I find particularly interesting about it is how kind of the conventional thinking originally at the time was to take the central limit order book and then try and shove that on chain.
00:17:23.810 - 00:18:07.494, Speaker C: But then it turned out that, you know, the correct design was actually something that was, like, fairly radically different. And it just took such a long time for people to wrap their heads around it and understand why it worked. And so kind of seeing, understanding that, you know, Solana is, like, fundamentally taking a different set of trade offs, but it is still a blockchain that is running on a global set, globally, globally distributed network of validators. It still has these constraints and understanding that amms are ultimately still the right primitive, even for something like Solana. Those are some of the big reasons why we decided to focus on amms.
00:18:07.542 - 00:18:31.180, Speaker B: First, could you talk, I think, right now, probably going to be in a debate forever about amms versus order books, but could you speak specifically to the different trade offs that you think one or the other is making and specifically why you're doubling down on this Amm model?
00:18:31.560 - 00:19:36.110, Speaker C: Yeah, I would actually, one thing that I've been pushing is reframing the question, and nothing is it amms or clouds, but actually just understanding that particularly concentrated liquidity amms are incredibly similar to clops. And fundamentally, even for market makers, they can think of kind of the different, they can think of providing liquidity on a concentrated liquidity amm as very similar to market making on a central limit order book. However, there are kind of, like, fundamental differences. So I'm going to just focus on a concentrated liquidity. And in a club, one of the fundamental differences, and this is like, can be quite nuanced and in the weeds is that as a market maker on a central limit order book, you set a limit order. If someone kind of fills that limit order, then the liquidity and the assets are taken off the order book. In comparison, when you look at a concentrated liquidity, ammdezenhe a market maker, they provide liquidity within a tick.
00:19:36.110 - 00:20:01.850, Speaker C: Once that order is filled, the assets stay in the pool. It's just that they provide liquidity on the opposite side. That's one fundamental difference. Atomically. When a trade is executed in a central limit order book, liquidity is taken off the order book. It's concentrated liquid amms. It stays in the order book atomically.
00:20:02.870 - 00:20:51.070, Speaker B: That makes sense, I think. I mean, this topic will probably be debated for a long time, and I think your approach is very unique, and you guys are approaching it from a novel way. And I think from the customer standpoint, it also provides a great experience. And so maybe going a little bit deeper on the technical nuance, is it on these, like, distributed systems of order books, is it specifically harder just because how many bids in ask ultimately get set for order books? Or again, like, maybe just like going like one level deeper to try to, like, call, like any pushback that you get from, like, people from one architecture, from another?
00:20:51.850 - 00:21:52.946, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think, I think part of it is the technical complexity of having a fully on chain order book. You kind of mentioned that, and I think that's something that is hard to quantify, but it does exist. I think another factor that is under discussed is essentially the benefit of making it more accessible to provide liquidity on an amm. The reason for that stems from what I said earlier about how liquidity stays in the order book, or rather how liquidity stays in the pool for a concentrated liquidity. That allows a market maker on a concentrated liquidity and say, hey, I just want to provide liquidity within price range, and then they're able to provide liquidity in a fairly efficient way. If they wanted to do that on an order book, they would have to basically create a bot and then run it on AWS.
00:21:52.946 - 00:22:37.900, Speaker C: And even then, I think there's a lot of complexity because they kind of have to compete with others to set orders back onto the order book. And so that essentially kind of like opens up the pool of folks that can provide liquidity. And then the net effect there is that there's more competitiveness for market making, and then deeper liquidity, and then more competitive rates. And this is true both for something like Sol on Solana, which we expect to be fairly competitive. And then this is also true for long tail tokens, like, for example, a new altcoin on Solana, where only so many people can provide liquidity.
00:22:38.020 - 00:23:16.550, Speaker A: It's really good for builders, actually, in that sense. And I think that's something that is a little bit underappreciated, is that a lot of these builders are not market makers and don't have the capacity to market make. But then a token is very useful for them in order to essentially bootstrap their project. They can actually provide essentially the full range of liquidity, similar to an x times y equals k amm as well, and have the flexibility to do so and just get that liquidity up and running. I think the flexibility of the model is something that allows for a really good user experience for both these users who are builders are more casual and these more advanced traders.
00:23:16.950 - 00:23:47.410, Speaker B: Definitely market making is a full time job in itself, and I think everybody has their hands full enough. So could you speak Ori to more of the user design aspect and really how you've kind of tried to tailor it to one, like kind of the crypto native, but also just like the normal everyday person that's crypto curious that wants to come on chain and try out orca and your product that you're building and swaps.
00:23:48.590 - 00:24:21.534, Speaker A: I always say this, but I still laugh that Orca actually gets praised so much for its Ux even now, because I look at this UI that Yutaro and I cobbled together, like, you know, in our house in Tokyo two years ago, and I'm like, man, this is like crap. Like, everything could be so much better. You know, we just kind of. I did some user interviews. I like, followed my design process and put something together. But the fact that it was, like, so well loved to me, really just echoed the fact that it was such a low bar in the first place. But I think if we go back to really where it started, what I did was actually just speak to defi users.
00:24:21.534 - 00:25:01.312, Speaker A: I wasn't one. I had no knowledge. And I think in some ways that lack of baggage was really helpful. I just observed what people were doing when they were actually making trades on other platforms, whether it was centralized or even on uniswap, and made observations. Like, it's really annoying to have to go back and forth to open your metamask, to check your balances every time. Like, did my trade go through? How long do I have to wait? I'm going to look at the block explorer or even to, like, I'm going to cross reference my price across these three different centralized exchanges. All these things are things that can be solved with technology, right? Like, my mantra for design is always that technology should be doing the things that humans don't want to do.
00:25:01.312 - 00:25:28.960, Speaker A: Right. Humans should do the fun stuff, like actually doing the trade and not like all this, like, price referencing. And so I added those into the original version of Orca, but the new version of Orca that we're going to be launching in a couple of weeks, I would say is really the next step in the evolution of that experience. I have a lot more experience actually using DeFi, working with people in Defi, and I think all of those things are going into the updated version.
00:25:29.460 - 00:25:48.980, Speaker B: Perfect. Yeah. I've seen some of the teaser stuff that you put out, Twitter and super excited for that to be launching soon. Can you talk about a little bit more? I don't know how much you can or cannot share, but some of the specific improvements on the design aspect that you're really looking forward to.
00:25:49.400 - 00:26:33.860, Speaker A: Yeah. So between you and me and everybody listening to this podcast, I'd say that the theme, or I guess the slogan that I picked for orca too, is, I think, kind of says it all and that's it just works. So orca has a couple different types of users, right? There's the folks who are more crypto curious, as you say. There are these very advanced market makers and pro traders. They're builders. And the new orcas, as we like to call it, really does cater, I think, to everyone, but primarily to that more crypto curious user. And I think there's still a lot of things that we as everyday, or like people who use crypto every day can forget, can be so confusing to a first time user.
00:26:33.860 - 00:27:34.580, Speaker A: How come this transaction doesn't seem to be confirming, right? Like, what's happening when it hangs? Do I need to like, sign my wallet thing again? Like, is there some risk? And so end to end, the new orca is really supposed to make that simple experience of trading as reliable as possible. And I think that's where, like, this slogan, it just works comes in. Because, you know, maybe most of the time, most amms or like Dexs will just work, but they don't necessarily work when it really counts, you know? And, like, when it really counts is when bonk is like, going crazy. You know, you're really just trying to get a trade through and like, the prices are crashing and then you're just like, insert swear word here because I don't know if we're going to bleep that out, but, like, you know, that's when it really counts. And so I think that's when the new orca is really there to hold your hand. Right. Like, first of all, we've made some, like, just basic improvements, like refreshing prices more often, making the, the actual display of that price refresh way more obvious, and adding in these little, I think, like, delightful design details.
00:27:34.580 - 00:28:12.764, Speaker A: Like there's a progress bar that sort of counts down every time you get a quote. And then towards the end of it, the bar will turn from green to yellow to red and the price will start flashing. Almost like when you're crossing the street and you see the traffic line is like, you better hurry up and get that trade in, otherwise we're going to get a new quote, little things like that. Also just, we're actually going to be increasing the rate of refresh for adjust. We're going to be dynamically adjusting rather, priority fees. That's something where on most other platforms, users have to manually enter priority fees. And I think this is another example of where technology should be able to just do this, right.
00:28:12.764 - 00:28:42.026, Speaker A: Like, there'll be a function that you can call that gives you the amount of priority fees that you should theoretically use. And if that doesn't go through, then we can adjust it again under the hood. And then when you actually do complete the transaction, you'll actually be able to see a list of your recent transactions in the interface, which, which sounds like it should be table stakes for any trading platform, but it does not seem to exist anywhere in crypto. That's a lot of little things that come together to hopefully make things really simple at the end.
00:28:42.218 - 00:29:33.250, Speaker B: Definitely. No, I think I always marvel at even the basic stuff that is thrown on the user instead of, as you said, the technology helping the user. At the end of the day, I think from that standpoint, crypto definitely has a long way to go, but exciting that you're making those changes. I think maybe Yutaro is speaking a little bit on the technical side. I think since Solana has launched, both of you have seen it go through many ups and downs. Solana having a historic rise similar to ETH in 2017, and roundtripped it just like Ethereum, all the way back down. But from the networking standpoint, I think it has grown pretty vastly under the hood.
00:29:33.250 - 00:29:47.570, Speaker B: And one of those being priority fees, could you talk about, I mean, just some of the network performance upgrades that you've seen over time? And how has that actually affected orca itself?
00:29:48.630 - 00:30:42.160, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think the kind of the quick upgrades. So the quick upgrades in order to replace UDP has allowed transaction throughput and transaction completion reliability to become a lot better when the network is in a relatively stable place. Prioritization fees. There's actually a little bit more infrastructure work that's required on the Solana side, particularly kind of with the 1.14 upgrade. That didn't happen recently. So I think there's a little bit more work that's required on the Solana side in order to get us to a place where the network can truly be kind of like in a stable place for essentially all network conditions.
00:30:43.660 - 00:30:52.950, Speaker B: And if your biggest critique, or I not critique, but thing that you would snap your fingers and could do today, or have the Solana foundation implement, what would that be?
00:30:53.610 - 00:32:08.144, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, it would definitely be kind of doing more to ensure that there are no network halts. And I would also say that I don't have full visibility into what's going on within the Solana kind of engineering team. And so I can't speak kind of. I can't speak with full confidence on what is going on. But as far as I can tell, for example, what I have seen is that they're proposing that maybe there could be a grant for testing testnet upgrades so that they can simulate mainnet upgrades more accurately. In my opinion, this is probably something that is like so critical that it needs to be done kind of within the core team and not through grants. For example, I remember with ETH two, there were some folks within the Ethereum foundation that were incredibly good at battle testing the testnet in order to make sure that the upgrade went smoothly.
00:32:08.144 - 00:33:02.070, Speaker C: And then ultimately it did. And that was, that was kind of a great thing for Ethereum. I think there should be similar teams within the Solana foundation that is basically full time simulating the main net environment within testnet and then battle testing these upgrades and making sure that if there are any issues, it gets flagged in testnet more quickly. I think that Solana this next year is going to be quite crucial. If it can kind of like make a few upgrades without the network halting, then I think it can turn around the narrative. Otherwise, it's going to be kind of quite difficult for Solana to be able to convince others that it's worth parking assets on Solana or building on Solana, even if the technology is actually there.
00:33:02.810 - 00:33:53.568, Speaker B: Yeah, I've always been envious of Ethereum having multiple clients, and I think once fire dancer is live in like Q, one of 2024, Solana will be the second blockchain with multiple clients, which I'm hoping helps reliability quite a bit. But from the outages standpoint how do you feel like it has either affected the product or team? I mean, obviously, outages suck. And I think I, the worst thing that they really hamper is the progress of the Solana ecosystem more broadly, which. Yeah, no way to put it. Besides, it sucks. So, like, both of your words, like, how has it, like, either directly impacted the team or the product itself?
00:33:53.704 - 00:34:56.560, Speaker C: One thing that's incredibly nice about amms is that it truly is fully automated. So then, even in the most extreme market conditions or even network calls, there, there isn't any kind of additional manual steps that are required. In that sense, the team itself was isolated. It's more just like, at some point, we looked up and we just saw how big of a narrative problem these network halts were for the rest of the Solana ecosystem. And, yeah, I think kind of more broadly, we've been thinking about other products to build. And I think one of the things that we've learned is that, let's say we want to build maybe margin trading or futures trading that has leverage involved. And then when there's leverage involved, network halts become much more serious because there's a risk of liquidations while the network is halted.
00:34:56.560 - 00:35:10.819, Speaker C: And then thinking about kind of like, is it even possible to kind of fully automate this so that we don't have to stay up all night when the network halts? I think that's kind of an interesting kind of thought experiment or just an exercise for the team to go through when designing products.
00:35:11.199 - 00:35:42.636, Speaker A: Yeah, I would add to that and say outages are never fun. And the impact on Solana has been really tough for what Yutaro said. But on the other hand, orcas fared pretty well, I think, throughout all of this. You know, and you mentioned the first break point. At the first break point, it was like crazy bull market conference. But Orca was definitely still an underdog. You know, I think the folks who came up to us, actually, I did feel like it was such a magical experience when people came up and they're like, oh, I love orca.
00:35:42.636 - 00:36:22.860, Speaker A: Like, so inspired. I use it to teach my dad how to crypto or whatever. I was like, that still felt pretty unique because, like, I, Orca, was not the major player, I think, in the ecosystem. What orca has done is survive all of these, whether it's downtime or outages or certain notable organizations collapsing, and come out actually with a larger market share. And I think that is a testament to the hard work that's been done on the product front. But also, I think the BD front the marketing front and really just building a product and a protocol that people trust, even in a time when trust is really hard to find.
00:36:23.800 - 00:37:16.000, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah. No, and I think, yeah, I mean, even at the event that I attended, I think there was less than 50 people at the first breakpoint event for orca. And so I think you purposely kept it small, but it was a tight knit community and it was cool to be there. And it's amazing just how much you have grown. And I think just being in crypto since 2017, there's remarkable success by just surviving in itself and continuing to iterate on the product, continuing to make things more simplistic from the user experience, continuing to add more reliability in these trustless systems, building trust with your communities and users. So I applaud both of you and the team for ultimately the roller coaster that you've been on. It's not easy.
00:37:17.380 - 00:37:18.600, Speaker A: Same to you, man.
00:37:20.140 - 00:37:31.920, Speaker B: But on that front, you're doing the UI refresh and then you, I believe, have another product ultimately coming up. Orca Pro. Could you share a little bit more about that as well?
00:37:32.380 - 00:37:41.988, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah, we'd love to talk about that. So I think for now, Orca Pro is what we're calling it internally. Not really sure what we're going to ultimately call it externally.
00:37:42.084 - 00:37:45.800, Speaker A: The branding team is working on it. Small team.
00:37:46.220 - 00:37:58.600, Speaker C: Yeah. But basically we were looking at the market making experience for our concentrated liquidity amm. And thinking about it, talking to users, one thing we realized is that.
00:38:00.660 - 00:38:00.948, Speaker B: The.
00:38:00.964 - 00:39:15.660, Speaker C: Experience that we have for market making on our concentrated liquidity amm, it is basically an iteration of the original LP interface for the classical amm. And what we realize is that that is not, that is not the right interface for kind of concentrated liquidity amms. The main reason is that, you know, essentially kind of a concentrated liquidity amm is much more similar to a central limit order book. And so, you know, there are kind of these, these things that are basically information and user flows that folks have figured out for an ideal interface for central limit order books that are very appropriate for our concentrated liquidity amm as well. One thing very simply is a price chart. A price chart is very necessary because you're always going to be providing liquidity within a range. And you want to know what is the price history on different timeframes for the liquidity that you're trying to provide.
00:39:15.660 - 00:40:08.264, Speaker C: Another one is more simply looking at the liquidity depth with an order book, you always see the order book depth. And a lot of times you actually see two different views. One where it's vertically stacked and another one where it's horizontally aligned. But those interfaces are incredibly important as well. And then finally, a better view of expected return, like expected fees earned. Essentially, this is something that kind of is more unique to amms that doesn't necessarily exist in order books, but even if you look at binance, for example, they have tools for back testing, different strategies. I think those kinds of things are incredibly important for market making on a concentrated liquidity.
00:40:08.264 - 00:40:21.864, Speaker C: And so we want to take all those things together and then kind of rebuild the interface for market making and do it in a way.
00:40:21.992 - 00:40:22.700, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:40:23.280 - 00:40:33.020, Speaker C: And basically just rebuild the interface kind of with our kind of improved understanding of what market makers actually care about.
00:40:33.660 - 00:41:22.900, Speaker B: Makes a lot of sense, I think. Yeah, I mean, amms were really kind of birthed in the crypto ecosystem, and the design, as you mentioned, has kind of stayed relatively same. But there is a lot more information under the hood that you could be providing. And by bringing that to the forefront, combined with the special features that amms provide, can be very powerful when all kind of surface together. And I think that ultimately that ties back to the user experience and really making crypto more simple. I think I always look at, or try as much as possible to look at user metrics. And even some of the more popular applications in all of crypto only have a couple million users.
00:41:22.900 - 00:41:47.120, Speaker B: I'm very excited for the day when we have tens of millions and then hundreds of millions. I'm optimistic that we'll be on Solana just because the architecture is, I think, very unique. But by building these tools, by creating the better user interface, I think Orca is fairly well positioned to capture a lot of that.
00:41:48.300 - 00:42:51.946, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm personally really excited for this because I think it's a pretty radical reframing of what's out there. I think the concentrated liquidity, amm in particular, is one where the existing interfaces very much adhere to the, let's just take the underlying data models and spit them on the screen mentality of design. And even Orca's current design, I would say, is guilty of that. And so I think this is a really great opportunity to integrate all of that, to create an interface that is designed for what we now have a much better understanding of is the target user, and already matches their existing workflow. So again, instead of going off onto a different site to look at the candlesticks and to draw your lines, and all of that should be available right there in the interface. But even before you get there, like Orca should be helping you identify these undercapitalized pools that have a really high ratio of fees to liquidity, and also have that sort of crab like movement that you're looking for right when you're at clam lp. And so I think all of those steps should be provided by the interface.
00:42:51.946 - 00:43:19.120, Speaker A: Like, be able to identify these pools, get in there, click and drag for the actual range that you want, see the liquidity depth within that range for each different feature, and then make an informed decision from there on how much liquidity to put in to the pool and to be able to track that more easily. All those things are. I won't say that we have a 100% defined spec for this future product, but things that we're thinking about when it comes to how to improve the experience.
00:43:19.540 - 00:43:25.760, Speaker B: Any teasers on an MVP that will be launched on Mainnet?
00:43:27.630 - 00:44:10.250, Speaker A: I mean, I think at the very minimum, you will definitely find those candlesticks that like click and drag behavior, a more integrated liquidity depth chart that is easier to read. And I think also a more intuitive experience and a simpler experience for repositioning, which is a huge pain point for LP's right now. I think repositioning, I don't even really think of it as the right way of thinking about it anymore. I think of it as essentially like editing an existing position, or I guess like editing essentially your orders, if it was an order book. To be able to adjust not only the range, but also the amount of liquidity, kind of all in one go, and in a very simple interface that takes just one or two clicks, as opposed to the probably five or six clicks that it takes on orca today.
00:44:11.150 - 00:44:21.726, Speaker B: And that will be in a month, two months. Never ask engineers for estimates.
00:44:21.918 - 00:44:25.370, Speaker A: Usually three x whatever estimate comes out of any engineers.
00:44:26.210 - 00:44:28.426, Speaker C: I've never gotten an estimate right, so.
00:44:28.458 - 00:44:30.110, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:44:31.850 - 00:46:03.480, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, this is a bit of a kind of tangent, but I remember one of the narratives from a few years ago was that, hey, in tradfi, ultimately, kind of the model that got all the adoption was the central limit order book model. And therefore it makes like, maybe that's kind of a signal that it's kinda of the best way to create markets, and therefore we should do that on a. That would be the case on a blockchain as well. I actually suspect, and to a certain degree this is a counterfactual that can never really be proven, but I suspect that kind of a concentrated liquidity amm type construction, even off of a blockchain, but in centralized servers, could actually be quite good and could actually be quite competitive with the traditional order book model. And I think a lot of that might be just due to the fact that market making becomes a lot more competitive and essentially more people would be able to do market making. If you look at who is actually market making in trad five for us equities, for example, it's actually a very small set of, you know, highly, highly skilled, highly specialized professionals and like a few geographic regions and maybe like that.
00:46:03.480 - 00:46:20.172, Speaker C: I think kind of like the mainline narrative is that that's the case because it's so competitive. But maybe actually the reason why is because like, the barrier to entry is high and it's actually kind of not as competitive as like people make it out to be.
00:46:20.356 - 00:46:26.880, Speaker A: I think if you want the controversial two word sound bite for why is a clam better than a clob? It's deeper liquidity.
00:46:27.540 - 00:46:50.880, Speaker B: Interesting. I love it on that point of view. I mean, could you break apart how you kind of think about your audience and users today, one from an actual user of the product and then a person or an LPD providing liquidity, are there any specific buckets that you think about people and how they use your products?
00:46:52.700 - 00:48:10.680, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, essentially, kind of very simplistically, the user base right now are folks that are active on chain that just want to kind of trade one token for another. You know, we see kind of the majority of trades, actual user trades, being between Sol and USDC. But then in addition we see, I'm just going to throw out a number. I don't know how accurate it is, but I think roughly 30% of trades are altcoins. Right now, bonk and I believe RLB are two fairly popular tokens that a lot of people are trying to trade. Essentially, it's just like folks that are active on chain that kind of want to swap these tokens one for another. When it comes to the difference between folks that are trading and folks that are market making, I think one conversation I had with someone at junk that I thought was quite illuminating for me is that at the end of the day, kind of market making and actively swapping one token for another.
00:48:10.680 - 00:49:13.100, Speaker C: These are both trades, as in every single trade has the active trader and then the market maker, and they're kind of two sides of the same coin. So it can sometimes be useful to think of them as two separate folks or two different categories of users. But a lot of times there's significant overlap between the two. And one way of thinking about it is traders are those that want to take a directional position and then market makers are folks that, for the most part, think that there's at least a temporary correlation between the two and that there's going to be what folks call a crab market. But that could be kind of like in the five minute timeframe or one day timeframe, a one week timeframe or a one year timeframe. It's kind of up to the market maker how long they want the timeframe to be for their own actions.
00:49:13.640 - 00:50:08.540, Speaker A: And there's builders as well, I think, as another segment of users of the protocol. Overall, I would say also even two subcategories of builders. One is essentially projects that just want to bootstrap liquidity, and others are using orca as SDK to actually build stuff on top of orca. That part gets me personally, a little bit nerdily excited, because then we're starting to think about use cases in which users may not even really know that they're trading on a blockchain. I think that's the long term of where crypto needs to get to succeed, is these real world use cases that, in turn for orca, translate to this somewhat price insensitive retail trading volume and make the flywheel turn. But I think we started to see a little bit of this last year with Stepn Integrating orca. And for the first time, I had friends in Japan who were like, oh, I'm using this step in thing and I'm making money by walking.
00:50:08.540 - 00:50:22.292, Speaker A: How cool. I was like, did you know that you're actually using orca under the hood? They're like, what? It was an early case, but I think cases like that are super exciting. And for crypt to take off, I'm knocking on wood. Hopefully, we'll see more and more of.
00:50:22.316 - 00:50:53.220, Speaker B: Those on that front. I mean, so I feel like we had Samo in this cycle. We had bonk and also stepn. Each of those, could you. Maybe you don't have to speak to anyone specifically, but overall, how some of those virality brought in either users or people into the ecosystem, and maybe even some of the surprises that you learned from some of those big moments.
00:50:54.840 - 00:51:33.860, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, maybe I can talk about stepn, because I think that one was one of the more interesting ones. One of the big reasons why it's so interesting is because the user base I was actually using kind of step in and doing the swaps between, let's say, USCC and GMT, or USCC and Gsthenne. It was so separate from the rest of the orca user base. So we saw the volume increasing, but then we weren't actually seeing any. A whole lot of chatter on Twitter or even on discord because they didn't even know the users. They're not on crypto Twitter. Right.
00:51:35.400 - 00:51:36.420, Speaker B: What a shock.
00:51:36.720 - 00:51:39.112, Speaker C: Yeah. And that's what I thought.
00:51:39.176 - 00:51:41.540, Speaker A: Apple Watch is trying to contribute to this.
00:51:42.530 - 00:51:46.082, Speaker B: Siri always has to jump in on podcasts. It's mandatory.
00:51:46.266 - 00:52:14.248, Speaker C: Yeah, it's bad Siri anyways. Yeah. So that was incredibly interesting. And, you know, at least I think for both of us, we didn't even really understand what stepn was until kind of, it was doing ridiculous numbers and it kind of forced us to look further into kind of what was going on. But I suppose that's also kind of one of the really. That's kind of one of the strengths of our product. It truly is automated.
00:52:14.248 - 00:52:40.000, Speaker C: So we don't even really. We aren't actually the gatekeepers. A lot of folks ask, how did Stefan end up on orca? Well, we didn't actually. Us, at least the two of us didn't do anything. There were some great folks on Solana foundation side and RPD side that kind of made things happen. But for the most part, it's like everything is truly permissionless.
00:52:40.980 - 00:53:17.242, Speaker A: I think you're underselling Orca's developers. They are actually the real champs here. People like Meep and scuba, obviously real names here, people who I think took this approach of human centered design and apply it to developer experience. When people ask, how do you get people to use orca? How do you get builders to use orca? I think it's like developer experience is user experience. Developers are users and it's about giving them interfaces that make sense. It's really not so different from looking at a UI and understanding how to use it. You want to look at the function names and instantly know how to use something.
00:53:17.242 - 00:53:35.276, Speaker A: You want to provide utilities in the languages and in the frameworks that people are already using. And Orca has some really brilliant developers who just treat this as an art, as a craft to get really nerdy about making sure that devs have the right tools available. And that's actually why Solana advocated for the integration.
00:53:35.468 - 00:53:44.884, Speaker B: And on that front, I mean, maybe going back to speaking to the SDK that you developed and some of the things that you've been working under the hood on that.
00:53:44.972 - 00:54:35.260, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, we've been incredibly fortunate with kind of our engineering team and for example, Meep, who is one of our engineers, he came from essentially kind of like a FAANG background. And essentially, I'm sure you're familiar a lot of these FAANG engineers, they're just hammered in certain disciplines in them over and over and over again. And I think he's a pretty good embodiment of that. But when he joined, he basically just took over the SDK, put a lot of effort into making sure that the public interface was easy to consume, easy to use. And we got so much great feedback from all these developers about how easy it was for ORc SDK to use.
00:54:36.640 - 00:54:47.608, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, on that, I think smart router is actually a really interesting thing to talk about as something that is a huge technical innovation, but also something that helped improve the UI side.
00:54:47.784 - 00:55:45.630, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah, I mean, that's another one where kind of ultimately just, there's no silver bulletin, it's just a lot of hard work on the engineering side. But recently we upgraded the routing mechanism for the swap interface. Essentially, we have a nearly optimal routing algorithm that can both hop over multiple legs, but can also split trades in order, split larger trades. And essentially it was just a computer engineering problem because we wanted the route calculation to happen on the client side. That required us to be able to fetch all the counts that are required to calculate the best route efficiently. That required both batching the network requests.
00:55:45.630 - 00:56:47.814, Speaker C: Then there's also just so many details involved. For example, kind of calculating the PDA's in Solana actually turns out to be fairly non trivial because you kind of have to do multiple hashes in order to discover the PDA. And so what we realize is that actually at a certain scale, we need to pre fetch the PDA's and then cache them as well if we want the user experience to be kind of quite responsive. So we put in all this work in order to make that happen. And then I think, yeah, we did a soft launch, essentially, of our new router mechanism. But it's something that I'm incredibly proud of that the engineering team did. And just like, I basically tell everyone kind of like kind of, you know, to try it out and just compare it with like kind of other existing routers on the Solana ecosystem, because ours is definitely kind of like best in class at the moment.
00:56:47.942 - 00:57:07.170, Speaker A: And the rates are actually better than what we're seeing on some aggregators right now, up to 30, 40% of the time, and then within a very, very narrow range, another like 50 60% of the time in our current test. So I think that kind of speaks to the algorithmic efficiency of this. And I think it's just beautiful.
00:57:07.520 - 00:58:07.272, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, often when I swap, I will look at different places just to kind of double check if I'm doing a larger order. And I'm always pleasantly surprised that orca is normally number one. And so it makes it kind of easy and ultimately helpful for me, just because over time I don't want to look at very many places because I know orca is typically going to be the best place for. For my swaps. So definitely appreciate all the work that you and the team have done there. Maybe closing the podcast or wrapping it up, what are like, I mean, obviously you have a couple product launches, you're revamping the UI, really making things much easier from the user perspective. For LP's, what are you specifically excited for? One, I would say, like, outside of those two things, for either the orca team or the ecosystem going forward in 2023.
00:58:07.396 - 00:59:13.270, Speaker A: The other thing that I'm really excited about, and I think a lot of orca users actually don't know about, is orcas impact initiatives, which I think have always been part of the protocol and kind of stem back to that background that I mentioned of always trying to work in goody two shoes fields. But one is actually the big donation that orca made of almost a million dollars last year through the orca knots NFT sale, and that actually funded rather a partnership with the NGO Aflatun, which is focused on financial literacy for youth, specifically helping them develop a digital currency and cryptocurrency literacy curriculum in regions of the world where this knowledge is badly needed. And so that includes Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia. And the first pilot programs are actually happening right now, training the instructors who will be teaching these. So I think that's super exciting. And the second is actually something that's ongoing even now, every time that anyone makes a trade on orca, some portion of that goes towards the climate fund, which has actually raised like over $1.4 million to date.
00:59:13.270 - 00:59:48.988, Speaker A: So kind of mind boggling to me. And is administered by a decentralized working group of orca, which is mainly folks from sustainability backgrounds who steward these funds and make sure that they go to the right organizations that can make the most impact. So already 550,000 has been donated to the Ocean Conservancy, and now the working group has allocated more to go to different small grants that people can use for basically climate change focused initiatives. So I think that's something where I'm really excited, where the more we work on orca, the more that orca scales and the more that this impact also scales.
00:59:49.164 - 00:59:57.880, Speaker B: Amazing. I didn't realize the orca team has raised so much money for this so very cool to hear.
00:59:58.700 - 01:00:07.820, Speaker A: I'd say it's the protocol, it's not the team. Yeah, it's like purely funded by users. And I think that's the really magical thing, is the more orca scales, the more this impact scales.
01:00:08.800 - 01:00:10.820, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah.
01:00:13.120 - 01:00:44.450, Speaker C: Maybe if I can just like mention, I think. I think a few things. Kind of one is I'm excited to see kind of like development and the development of, like, additional financial primitives. Like, I think that for kind of the exchange of fungible tokens, a concentrated liquidity is essentially kind of like the theoretical optimum. Like, we're not going to see. We're not going to see. I could be wrong on this, but I suspect that we're actually not going to see kind of like radical design changes from here on out.
01:00:44.450 - 01:01:47.210, Speaker C: However, I think there's actually a lot of room for improvement for other financial primitives. Like, for example, one is kind of like features exchanges. I suspect that kind of. There is no kind of quite. There's quite. Or there's no design yet that is kind of quite, really good that everyone can kind of say, hey, this is kind of like how people should design futures exchanges that are decentralized. I think another one that I'm excited for, and I think Ori's gonna laugh at this, but LLMs, yeah, I suspect that kind of looking at kind of how intelligent kind of things like Copilot and GPT four are for kind of generating code and thinking about kind of like, essentially kind of the changes to software development that we can expect to see, even if, like, LLMs themselves don't kind of increase in capability, but we just kind of build better, kind of like tooling around it.
01:01:47.210 - 01:02:09.490, Speaker C: I suspect that we'll see disproportionate impact in the crypto space because the crypto space is so young and it's still relatively dynamic, and we'll be able to see adoption of these new software development processes in crypto more so than other industries.
01:02:12.800 - 01:02:48.210, Speaker B: Perfect. Perfect. Well, great retrake, great podcasts, and note, truly appreciate you taking a chance on Solana. Appreciate you having the human centered design. Appreciate you building defi in this ecosystem, and excited for what's to come with your new product launches, and very excited for, ultimately, for you to help bring in more users into the ecosystem. Thank you for everything that you've done, and thank you to the team and what you've built.
01:02:49.550 - 01:02:58.102, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Yeah, really appreciate you taking all the time to highlight people doing impactful work in this space, because that's a huge part of it as well, so appreciate it.
01:02:58.126 - 01:03:12.710, Speaker B: Yeah. Trying to highlight the builders who are building the ecosystem. I think there's a lot of noise and they're the ones whose voices should be listened to more, so. Yeah. Thank you again.
