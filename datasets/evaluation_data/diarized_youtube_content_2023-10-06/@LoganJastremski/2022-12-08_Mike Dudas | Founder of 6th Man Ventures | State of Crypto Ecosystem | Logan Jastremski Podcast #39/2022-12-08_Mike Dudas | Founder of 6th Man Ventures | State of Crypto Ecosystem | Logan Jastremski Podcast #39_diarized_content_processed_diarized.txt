00:00:01.080 - 00:00:29.790, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, super excited to have you here, Mike. Thank you so much. Honestly, big admirer of what you've done. I think it's very hard to create something and ultimately you've done that multiple times. Ultimately starting out with the block and now being at six, man, I would love to maybe just start the conversation there. And what inspired you ultimately to start the block and, yeah, kind of your journey into the crypto industry.
00:00:30.290 - 00:00:59.474, Speaker B: Absolutely. Hey, thanks for having me. Really exciting to be here, Logan. So the. So the truth of the matter is, I've been a longtime believer in the potential of public blockchains and permissionless applications, financial and non financial applications, but was first introduced to financial applications. This is while I was working in fintech. So I have a decade of experience in fintech, at Google Wallet, at Braintree Venmo.
00:00:59.474 - 00:02:25.104, Speaker B: Braintree is actually where I was introduced to bitcoin. Braintree is like a stripe, like payment gateway and processor that was acquired by PayPal. And we were thinking about in 2013 having bitcoin be a form of payment in Uber and Airbnb and other apps. And obviously that didn't happen, but it got me really interested in these public blockchains and the potential for them not necessarily to replace existing financial, in that case payment rails or financial products, but certainly to be an alternative to them. So anyway, got really excited, bought some bitcoin, but didn't really jump in and frankly missed sort of the evolution from just kind of like bitcoin to the launch of Ethereum. So that 2014 to early 2017 period, I sort of missed because I was so focused on a web two business, the introduction of smart contract enabled blockchains. So Ethereum, and then obviously there were a bunch of icos and there were other architectures like Solana, that launched kind of in the 2018 time period, but started to observe that in 2017, started to see some really interesting applications, like early nfTs, early, early DeFi, and got interested.
00:02:25.104 - 00:03:07.080, Speaker B: So said, hey, more than just money movement networks, we actually have some interesting applications that are starting to be built on public blockchains. And so I decided, hey, I want to be there. I want to move from fintech, where largely we're putting lipstick on a pig, we're putting nice UI and interfaces on legacy infrastructure. And I want to start to build out that alternative again, financial and non financial application layer. And so to your question, how did I decide to start the block? So I'm not like an engineer. So I'm not. I knew, like, we were still at that time, 2017, at the protocol layer, really like building out the protocols.
00:03:07.080 - 00:03:55.310, Speaker B: And I was just, I can't contribute there. I'd never been an investor. So you basically had like two main, and I wasn't a trader. Those are like the main market participants at that time were like really heavy engineering trading and venture investing, call it, and I'm oversimplifying, but those are the broad categories. But what I found is that a lot of the public and people were interested in their imaginations, were engaged by bitcoin, ethereum, and some of the more legitimate icos that were happening, things like Filecoin, and that have shown to be really starting to be valuable years later. But people are confused as hell, including me. And you'd ask somebody a question, you get ten different answers, or it would take ten people to answer one question.
00:03:55.310 - 00:04:46.122, Speaker B: So bottom line is, my goal has always been, I think these networks and I think the sort of, the systems and the governance around them are revolutionary, but it's really complex to tell a story. Let's try and. But to get people to use them, they have to start to understand them. So 2018, I said, let's, you know, I'm going to helped do that. So I started the block, did my best to recruit in the best researchers and journalists that I could find who were, what I would say is default, optimistic. And again, you see it today in the mainstream media, and I'm just going to use that oversimplified term, but you see a lot of skepticism of new things almost. It's just like built into the business model of news and frankly, of research that I wanted to offer a counterpoint to that that I believe is objective.
00:04:46.122 - 00:05:15.518, Speaker B: So basically informed, call it trade or industry coverage that would be understandable to a broad audience. So founded the block, was fortunate enough to meet incredible people like Larry Cermak, like Frank Shaparo, persuade them that we could put together a dream team. We had folks like Teo Leibowitz, who's at Uniswap. Our gen. Balaji was working part time before joining paradigm. Some really brilliant people, some whom, many of whom are still there. Stephen Zhang.
00:05:15.518 - 00:05:44.328, Speaker B: So it's been really, really exciting to see that business grow. I sold that, by the way, last year so they can continue to stay truly independent, which I think is critically important in this ecosystem. But, yeah, started the block because I felt like we needed credible, as objective as possible. Of course human beliefs and thoughts are going to enter into any piece. There's nothing that's truly perfectly objective. They did a good job there. We did a good job there.
00:05:44.328 - 00:06:13.208, Speaker B: That being said, it's stressful as hell. And so I told it because I'm really out there. And if you're prominent and you're dox in this ecosystem and you're doing research into companies, many of which later turned out to be frauds or turned out to be poor risk managers or turned out to be incompetent, you're attacked relentlessly, both formally via legal means as well as informally. And I just got exhausted and by it, and said, hey, if I'm in the money flow industry, I ought to get myself actually into the money flow.
00:06:13.344 - 00:06:55.148, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's super impressive. I mean, I really do ultimately admire the people that can build things. It's extremely, extremely difficult. There's a lot of kind of people that would like to comment from the crowds, so to speak. And so I always admire the people in the arena building. And so, no, it's impressive. I guess ultimately, from that time building the block, what were some of like the biggest takeaways? Was this your first kind of entrepreneurial journey? What was the like, biggest lessons there as like building and growing the team also as kind of, well, I guess 20 1819 was kind of the bear market.
00:06:55.148 - 00:06:59.668, Speaker A: But as the industry kind of grew, what were some of the learnings there as well?
00:06:59.844 - 00:07:26.030, Speaker B: Yeah, so it was the second business I built. The first was a web two business called button still exists, doing many tens of millions in revenue, I believe cash flow positive. We raised 65 million. So I'd actually started a company, was co founder and chief revenue officer there. So it was the first company I was CEO of, though. So one thing I learned is, and I still to this day say I want to be building things in an area where there are no experts. Right.
00:07:26.030 - 00:08:10.430, Speaker B: So there was no expert. There's very few areas of crypto where there are truly experts. And frankly, the people who look like experts turn out to be, two years later, not the best. Token economics people of the last cycle basically created the token economics that blew up some of the largest protocols. So we don't need to name names, but that's just what happened. So one thing is, I've never run a news or media organization, but I was able to persuade people who were professionals in those areas to come together and work together as a team. So one big learning is you don't have to be an expert yourself, but you do need to put people around you who have experience.
00:08:10.430 - 00:08:51.966, Speaker B: So my unique experience was kind of in recruiting and telling a story and being mission driven in principled, and so was very successful there. Some other things that I learned are people who have tons of experience, by the way. It has to be the right experience. I thought we needed, for example, formal news editors. I had to fire the first two that I hired because they came from traditional news and just had no, they weren't native and didn't really. So it's always about people. I also learned I actually, as I mentioned, bitcoin was the first thing I'd ever purchased in crypto.
00:08:51.966 - 00:09:51.548, Speaker B: And I was kind of like, I think bitcoin maximalists would never have accepted me as a bitcoin maximalist, but I was like a bitcoin most demolist until, like, 2019. And I think what I learned is, and you see this a lot in the media today, people don't separate the actual work that goes on the page, like the professional work from, hey, what you say on Twitter or in person. So you have to be really, really careful. You can't just change Personas. And I think that I did a disservice to some of the great work by being very outspoken and I a little too attack worthy and particularly, and you're seeing it again now. And I think it's really important because we're in a bear market right now, and you're seeing a lot of crossfire, cross chains, cross projects, you name it is, you know, we have enough challenges. What I learned at the block is we have enough challenges inside, I'm sorry, outside of the industry.
00:09:51.548 - 00:10:43.868, Speaker B: Right. Like, from governments, from, you know, entrenched interests, from the 99% of the people in the world who have never used, like, actually used a public blockchain that we shouldn't sort of shoot ourselves and that that crossfire makes us look unserious. So, you know, I kind of, like, learned that I was, I got myself a little bit too much into that in the last cycle of the down parts. It burnt me out. It wasn't useful. And so this cycle, I've learned to be, you know, I think not always like, I like to ship post and have a little fun here and there, but to generally be, you know, more positive and constructive in my criticism, public and private. Last thing is I learned that it's okay to build a business, sorry, to found a business that you don't actually.
00:10:43.868 - 00:11:13.830, Speaker B: You aren't the perfect person to run for 20 years. Right. And by the way, I think that's really important in crypto because a lot of these protocols that are built actually are ultimately going to be governed, maintained and grow via the community or via the public. Right. Like, the whole point is people own the network and use tokens to incentivize, to orchestrate decision making. That's also true of many crypto companies. So while I founded the block, I wasn't the right person.
00:11:13.830 - 00:11:40.266, Speaker B: And there was this group of people, I'm 43 now. I'm like a boomer in crypto terms. And everybody we hired was in their twenties, and it was just okay to say, hey, those folks are really better to take that mission forward for a long time, which I think you're going to see again, particularly in crypto. Crypto, a lot more of that, because cycles move fast. The community ultimately does run businesses. It's been cool. So just constantly, constantly learning.
00:11:40.266 - 00:12:06.018, Speaker B: The next business that I started was one called Linksdao. We can talk about that later. But ultimately, from day one, came up with the idea with a few folks, and from day one, I was like, I'm not the CEO of this business. We're going to find a group of people who can take this forward. And I never would have been comfortable with that seven, eight years ago. I would have been like, I have to micromanage this. And immediately knew there was my co founder.
00:12:06.018 - 00:12:08.070, Speaker B: Was going to be better to run that as CEO?
00:12:08.810 - 00:12:30.776, Speaker A: No, I think ultimately those are great points. Building the correct team and building people that are capable of the job, keeping a positive attitude through the ups and downs, and then ultimately knowing when to push forward and if other people are the most, maybe better, appropriate to kind of push forward the industry.
00:12:30.968 - 00:12:53.468, Speaker B: Exactly. The last one is just be yourself. So I can't change myself to be a different kind of CEO of the block. And the block needs like a very cool, calm, collected leader. And so basically that's the person, Mike McCaffrey, wonderful leader, who runs it today. Know your role and don't try to change yourself. And by the way, multiple styles work.
00:12:53.468 - 00:13:06.000, Speaker B: You have to be your own style. We need loud, vocal proselytizers who are clear and concise and credible at the same time that we need heads down builders. And you shouldn't be ashamed to be one or the other.
00:13:06.860 - 00:13:31.312, Speaker A: I definitely agree. Ultimately, you took a lot of those learning lessons and started six man. Could you go into a little bit of like, taking those lessons of being a founder, I guess, for the second time at the block, to building another company or firm with six man, and then ultimately share a little bit more of six man's thesis?
00:13:31.376 - 00:14:35.516, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So basically, starting a venture firm is, you know, traditionally, it's a really, really difficult thing to do, and, like, I would never have thought to do it in traditional venture because there's these very multi decade processes in place. But I did believe via my entrepreneurial experience, building businesses and just seeing the market and knowing the people, particularly meeting so many incredible founders wall at the block and being asked to angel invest and actually not doing it while I was running the block because I didn't want conflicts other than I think I made one investment into 21 shares because it was a very, very good friend of mine. The thing that I learned is starting a venture firm. It's a company, you have a management company. It's an entrepreneurial venture like anything else. And what's so rewarding about crypto VC? There's a strong misperception about what true crypto VC is.
00:14:35.516 - 00:15:50.918, Speaker B: I think in the public you have crypto hedge funds who are trading nonstop and often call themselves VC's. That's different. I'm not talking about that, but I'm talking about funds that have long term structures like ten years, ten years plus a couple years of fund life, up to five year investment periods, and are actually investing at the earliest stages in both equity and equity with token warrants, but actually equity of companies, which is something that we do in addition to investing in tokens if that's the form of consideration that's being offered depending on the type of business or project, but basically saw an opportunity for in crypto VC's actually have to participate in the project. You actually to be really valuable, use the network and use the products. An example is we invested in Magic Eden and I may massive NFT collector and trader massive might be an overstatement, but pretty big. And so you have to love the products and be able to offer these deep product insights and thank you. The founders like Grill you before.
00:15:50.918 - 00:16:46.014, Speaker B: They're like, why you? We're looking at a stablecoin business right now. I just had a meeting right before this and the founder is grilling you on like I worked at Paxos regularly stablecoin companies, I've spent a time thinking through it and what's exciting is in crypto is the founders really want you to impart that knowledge and work alongside them as entrepreneurs. And they typically will put together syndicates of investors, angels and professional investors who have these varied experiences. And you see with the biggest firms, for example, they have big research departments. I think at traditional VC's you'll see they have operating partners. But like most of its smokescreen here, it's like real, like they're actually like building out, you know, the best like paradigm or like literally building out frameworks that allow others to build businesses. So anyway, six MV, we started it, me and my founding partner Serge Kasarjan.
00:16:46.014 - 00:17:09.050, Speaker B: You know, we're, we are the classic. Like we met at Stanford like 20 years ago. You became really good friends. We met in the 6th man basketball club, the 6th man ventures. But also it's like, again, the spirit. We were just talking about helping founders when necessary. So six man comes off the bench in basketball to give a shot in the arm to the team.
00:17:09.050 - 00:17:56.410, Speaker B: That's the spirit of what we do. We don't invest in l one s themselves directly. We invest in the application layer, the crypto application layer, because it's where we have experience over multiple decades and everything from media and entertainment. I worked at Disney, I worked at YouTube, surge worked at Sony and a bunch of other places worked in fintech. So we have like really good experience that's relevant to the types of financial and non financial applications that are being built. So there are, you know, overarching. So we're not as thesis driven as for example, you know, there are deep thesis driven firms that will say, hey, we invest in these five areas and we are literally just going to sit on these five themes for the next twelve to 18 months and only invest in them.
00:17:56.410 - 00:19:03.816, Speaker B: What we are is we invest in some broad areas that we believe are really critically important and then we'll look for the right teams opportunistically. But we don't feel like we need, hey, if we don't find the right team in an area we're excited about, we don't feel like desperately like we need to invest there. Okay, we'll just move on to the next. So the areas that we invest in are so applications right now we've done historically a lot of like gaming and quote unquote metaverse, but really like gaming applications play and earn, you know, free to, free to own that kind of stuff. Sort of web, three networks, something like teleport, like a decentralized Uber that's being built using Solana on top of Solana marketplaces and wallets. Like we've invested in rainbow wallet and floor magic, eat and rarible, super rare. So we've invested in kind of that ecosystem all the way over to step in a move and earn game and then etherscan and then we get to infrastructure.
00:19:03.816 - 00:19:45.360, Speaker B: So things like decentralized identity. Decentralized, a weird word, but just like permissionless storage. Decentralized storage, but infrastructure developer tooling. We've done some node and wallet infrastructure. So basically it would be like applications, primarily consumer and business applications and then the second bucket being infrastructure to support that, because today it's really hard to use those applications. Another one is like we invest in fiat, on off ramps, we just invest in a company called cross Mint. Just a bunch of stuff like that overarching goal.
00:19:45.360 - 00:20:41.498, Speaker B: We want to invest in the applications that the next billion people are going to use, and then we want to invest in the infrastructure that's going to allow that to happen, whether it's, again, wallets, marketplaces, or decentralized infrastructure developer tool. In the last category, the thesis is, or sorry. Our strategy is we're pre seed and seed investors primarily. We have a, you know, our fund's $140 million in size, so we can't write $10 million checks into a single company. So what we're looking for is, hey, can we, you know, lead or co lead those rounds at the earliest stages and then continue to invest in companies as they grow and the bigger funds, you know, take our pirata as they grow and the bigger funds invest alongside us. But we're best as entrepreneurs at helping zero to one, right, and so go to market designing token economics. But the things that you have to do to set up a company from the earliest days, that's what we know how to do.
00:20:41.498 - 00:20:50.216, Speaker B: I haven't run a 10,000 person company, right? So I haven't taken a company public. So that's where the a 16 zs and the paradigms come in.
00:20:50.378 - 00:21:22.048, Speaker A: Perfect. No, just going back to some of the earlier things that you said. Ultimately, I definitely agree with VC's kind of being a value add if they're structured to incentivize the growth long term. I do think I agree with you. Ultimately, it is very misunderstood, especially in crypto. I think just because some of these tokens do become liquid relatively quickly, there's some misconceptions. But yeah, starting a venture fund is very hard.
00:21:22.184 - 00:21:24.136, Speaker B: Currently, you've done it, right?
00:21:24.248 - 00:21:29.616, Speaker A: In the process of doing it. I mean, we are live, but yes, it's extremely difficult.
00:21:29.808 - 00:22:04.840, Speaker B: Yeah. And particularly in crypto. So it's very entrepreneurial. You have to set up legal entities, you have to set up all types of security, either self custody, institutional custody, all kinds of licensing, onshore, offshore, super complex. But that, frankly, it's a moat. There's only so many people who both can do that, can then raise money, but then can also deploy it and help entrepreneurs. I think money was a little more accessible over the last couple of years for investors, and you're going to see a bunch flop.
00:22:04.840 - 00:22:10.674, Speaker B: And I think what's going to be interesting is to see in two years who's still around with strong returns.
00:22:10.812 - 00:22:54.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. And I ultimately think the landscape is shifting a little bit. But it was awesome to hear your walkthrough of explaining your strategy and thesis behind six man with the overarching goal of web3 adoption more broadly. So kind of jumping or piggybacking off the web3 adoption. You are a big proponent of the Ethereum ecosystem. I know magic Eden ultimately is started out on Solana, moved over to ethereum as well. Can you talk a little bit about why you're excited, specifically about those ecosystems and just going forward some things that excite you?
00:22:55.360 - 00:23:26.760, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So the primary ecosystems that we invest in today are the ethereum ecosystem. Certainly. That's where I would say the majority, sorry, we've deployed our polarity. The most money that we've deployed has gone into either the Ethereum ecosystem or call it multi chain infrastructure. Okay. Things again, like decentralized identity that could work across chains, decentralized customer support, you know, that could work across chains, things of that nature.
00:23:26.760 - 00:24:11.592, Speaker B: Second is Solana. So we've invested in the Solana ecosystem and then, yeah, we've started, we just made our first investment in the SWe ecosystem. So really, really excited about that. And then we've done a couple. So the Ethereum ecosystem, there's like the l one itself, but then there's, you know, you've got side chains, you've got l two s, you've got roll ups, right? So we've made investments in applications building on polygon, on avalanche. We're looking at some interesting things on starkware, and then exploring arbitrum, optimism and a bunch of other stuff. We've also done some ZK tech investments that again will sort of go across these different roll ups.
00:24:11.592 - 00:25:15.898, Speaker B: We've done bridges. So the thesis with Ethereum, like why invest there? It's just the most robust. So the most money today, my goal is that we'll be around for decades as a firm, and it's certainly possible in five years we'll be deploying more capital to other blockchain ecosystems that grow to larger dollar volumes. The fact of the matter is, out of all of the application layer blockchains, sorry, blockchain ecosystems that support robust applications like DeFi and non financial applications. Ethereum is by far the biggest. So it's just. You'd be crazy unless you have a very strong chain specific thesis, which we don't, to ignore Ethereum, I think it's most robust in that you have multiple different scaling technologies and approaches being attempted.
00:25:15.898 - 00:26:29.256, Speaker B: Now, I'm not an engineer, so you should definitely interview my partner Carl about his thoughts on the various approaches, none of which, by the way, are even close to riskless or even close to being proven to work at scale. And I've read and listened to a lot of what you've written, and I think I share some of your concerns about any one particular approach, which is, for example, why we're not an arbitrum maxi shop or anything like that. The bottom line is we invest primarily in good applications and good teams, and we'll make recommendations or talk to them about the trade offs of, again, building on polygon versus avalanche versus Solana, and sometimes we will invest a team pre selection of a chain, by the way. But again, the reasons that you would build, we built our own project, Linksdao on Ethereum, is because there's just the most money. That's where the buyers were, who would pay for the NFT, and also, you know, the most robust infrastructure at the time. This was January 1 of last year. So the best wallets, the most liquid marketplaces, NFT marketplaces.
00:26:29.256 - 00:27:09.990, Speaker B: I think Solana, you know, caught up over the span of last year, and we, you know, we all know what happened with FTX, and there's a little bit of uncertainty right now. But I feel like Solana has really, really good supporting infrastructure for applications as well. And we have a ton of companies that we've invested in that are building on Solana. And I'm very optimistic about Solana as well. I'm also excited about their architecture, where it's sort of monolithic and it's a layer, one that actually could scale as an l, one that excites us. So we believe in different approaches. And again, not being a chain specific thesis investor, we follow the entrepreneurs.
00:27:10.110 - 00:27:59.068, Speaker A: Nice. No, I mean, ultimately, I think one of the things that I, I've always admired the people that are better at Twitter, my co founder is much better than I, and you are. But I think one thing that I specifically admire about your Twitter and ultimately, how you communicate with these communities is the fact that going back to your earlier point of, like, trying to be positive and the sense of uplifting the individual communities, but also being, I would say, fair and objective. When people or individuals or kind of holistically, you think they're taking the wrong approach. So you're fairly criticizing both, like, well, you're complimenting on the way up. And then ultimately, if you think there's nefarious or bad things, you also will call that out. And so I appreciate about, yeah, and.
00:27:59.084 - 00:28:58.546, Speaker B: Occasionally I'll do it wrong, right? Like, I'll, like I'll say something public, I'll apologize. I'd rather be a little bit more edgy in that respect because I think you get closer to truths and then to your point. So, for example, let's just take Solana, currently. Part of the reason I've been so vocal, we're recording this in early December, is that since the FTX blow up, I feel like there has been quite a bit of misinformation about Solana. I think there has been some very accurate criticism of the Solana ecosystems and the types of projects that perhaps launched in 2021 and some of, you know, the VC's who were involved and other folks who were involved and perhaps did dump and retail didn't benefit. So some fair criticism. But I also think there's some tremendous things happening right now was at breakpoint, for example, Solana's conference a couple weeks ago, and tremendous optimism, tremendous things being built.
00:28:58.546 - 00:29:42.396, Speaker B: Obviously, it's just before the FTX blow up. So to your point, though, of sort of filling a gap, I've been a little bit critical over the last couple of days of people who were previously, I think, vocal, are still in the community, but maybe aren't stepping up to talk about what's being built. I don't know why. And it's frustrating me. So I'm trying to fill that gap. And I would say that includes both official, like actually people officially associated with Solana, whether it's labs, foundation, you name it, but also folks who have invested heavily. So I've started to see now groundswell of people talking about metrics that are positive.
00:29:42.396 - 00:29:54.598, Speaker B: And I'm really excited. And I think it's important to say and do uncomfortable things that are truthful, to sort of draw out and give others the confidence and the COVID to speak optimistically themselves.
00:29:54.764 - 00:30:35.524, Speaker A: No, and I think you nailed it on the last point. That is the hard part is saying the things that other people aren't always comfortable saying. And those are the leaders that I do admire the most. Ultimately, the topic of I was also at breakpoint. It was interesting because last year everybody was kind of euphoric, November 2020 to 2021, and then this year, ultimately, kind of the Luna explosion happened in the summer. And then I felt like that was kind of dwindling or end in the mirror, so to speak. And then breakpoint was a really fabulous event, in my opinion.
00:30:35.524 - 00:31:02.544, Speaker A: Lots of builders, a lot of enthusiasm, but it was semi comical in some sense, that ultimately, the day after breakpoint, all the FTX stuff happened. And your point of view, how does this kind of shape the landscape of crypto? Are we just going to be in a prolonged bear market? Not on price, but how do you view the landscape going forward in the wake of the recent events?
00:31:02.672 - 00:31:48.670, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. I believe that set aside price is important just in the very near term, because I do think we're in a. We're in a point where in the very near term, it's already happened. In some cases, you're going to continue, I think, to get drips of news for the next few months of projects, of entities who were impacted by FTX were impacted by not only on Solana, but other ecosystems where the token price have dropped dramatically and they didn't do good treasury management and they're just out of Runway. You're going to see projects go away. In some cases, it'll be a shame because they were some good projects, but in many cases maybe weren't going to make it anyway. So we need to work through that.
00:31:48.670 - 00:32:31.768, Speaker B: What I will say, though, is we are not in a sort of bear market for really interesting ideas and for credible builders across multiple blockchain ecosystems that I'm seeing. Right. So you have new ones and people are skeptical, but others are optimistic. Aptos and Swe. We've got those two blockchains coming over the next year and starting to grow. That'll be interesting to observe and see how they take off. You have again the ethereum ecosystem, including polygon, including avalanche, including immutable, and then you have Solana and then you have others.
00:32:31.768 - 00:32:54.336, Speaker B: But those are the areas that I focus cosmos. Obviously, there's a lot going on there. I'm just not as close to it. You can only be close to so many things in this space. At some point you just have to say, I'm not going to be able to go deep there. Perhaps as we grow as a fund over the years, we'll be able to add to the team and invest in more and more areas. But we tend to stick to the areas that we have a little bit more depth of understanding.
00:32:54.336 - 00:33:23.060, Speaker B: And sometimes you learn through the entrepreneur's you back. So it may be that we'll learn more about Cosmos over time through entrepreneurs that we back. But to the original question. So it's not a bear market I'm building, but it's a bear market certainly on usage. Businesses are very gun shy to now, although what's exciting is we're talking today and the Starbucks program is launching. That's exciting. I'm excited to see how that's received.
00:33:23.060 - 00:34:48.230, Speaker B: But again, largely new implementations that maybe weren't particularly financial implementations. I just know of a number of fintech and other products that were in pretty deep motion that I think people are hitting pause on as they see sort of the questions and the troubles around Silvergate and sort of the fallout as we, as Washington sort of turns its eyes towards the regulatory failures and the risk management failures of the past 18 months. So, yeah, we're going to be in, I think, a bear market in sort of new adoption, but not in terms of new building. And there is plenty of money in the ecosystem and it's being deployed by us, by you, and by others. I think extremely reasonable. Reminds me of 2018 and 2019 when, like, you could invest in a pre seed deal below $10 million, you could invest in a seed deal below $20 million, meaning a seed with traction like this stuff makes sense and it has to normalize, especially as you look at where a lot of the things that went public are trading and many of the lauded projects, their market caps are sub 50 million and they were like, privately funded well above that.
00:34:49.030 - 00:35:34.176, Speaker A: Yeah, no, yeah. Great points. I mean, ultimately, I would definitely echo the sentiments, especially after, like, breakpoint and talking with different ecosystems and people are excited to build and it feels terrible, at least at the moment, because last year felt amazing and everything was going up, builders were getting a bunch of money. But I think returning to kind of your last sentence is like, things are returning back to more normalized kind of behavior where, like, people, the focus is actually getting users and getting real world adoption. And I think that's sometimes what crypto got away from. It was more just number go up. And so I like you.
00:35:34.176 - 00:35:54.864, Speaker A: Ultimately, I'm very excited for crypto adoption and users. Maybe we have to go back to the drawing boards with building actually easy to use web3 applications, but hopefully when things kind of turn around, we'll have better experiences and more users.
00:35:55.032 - 00:36:23.030, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think it's to your point. So a lot of what we're investing is infrastructure. Right? I mentioned a few which. But, like, there are others, like security. Right? Like better MPC technology and smart contract wallets and things that, again, will allow people in a more secure way to interact with blockchains. Like, it's our job to do that. So that in the next go round, we have the right primitives in place for people to just kind of like, jump right in.
00:36:23.030 - 00:37:12.854, Speaker B: And then to your point, in the bull market, you're almost just responding to demand. And some of it was obviously, clearly a lot of it was skewed by price versus having been an entrepreneur myself, the discomfort that I think a lot of us feel right now as we build is healthy. We're not going to make unless you build the thing. What you're seeing now is a lot more startups at early stages having the time and the space to work with design partners because they don't have to service a growing customer base. That, by the way, in many cases was not growing organically. Right. They really have to earn those customers and work with design partners, whether it's enterprise or end user consumers.
00:37:12.854 - 00:37:38.880, Speaker B: So it could be deflating, I think, when people saw metrics that were wild and hey, maybe I'm serving one 10th or 20% of the customers that I was serving six to nine months ago, but I think it will serve many of these companies well. And then new companies that come in that are raising at reasonable valuations, it's like, hey, we can actually build a normal, on more of a normal curve over the next couple of years.
00:37:39.000 - 00:37:53.056, Speaker A: Definitely. Maybe switching topics for the last couple minutes. Ultimately, you are very involved in daos, maybe touch upon daos more holistically and then specifically Linksdao and some of the things there.
00:37:53.208 - 00:38:36.944, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll start by stating that links Dao is actually not a true Dao, like a decentralized, autonomous organization. Meaning, you know, we didn't establish ourselves legally as a Dow in the United States. It's extremely difficult to set up a DAO structure. There are a few states that offer them. I talked with numerous lawyers at multiple different firms, both professionally friends, who gave me counsel who I've worked with in the past, and ultimately just decided that for the type of enterprise. So Linksdao is a global golf and leisure membership club.
00:38:36.944 - 00:39:47.970, Speaker B: And we just basically for a couple things, one, legally didn't feel like a Dow structure would allow us to execute, but really give us the legal protection necessary to build out what we're trying to build for the folks who purchased our NFT, which grants them a bunch of perks, benefits, governance, rights, and, you know, the right to purchase a membership to the golf club. The way that we structured it, and frankly, many, quote unquote, daos do, is not like, hey, you vote, and then that the result of the vote triggers like an on chain action. That's like what a true Dow happens, right? Like, but we do virtually everything else. Meaning, like, we have a community where pods are nominated and they specialize in things like marketing course, selection, community engineering, you name it. Right? There's like twelve of them. And then the leaders of those pods then put forth proposals that the entire membership votes on. That vote is recorded on chain.
00:39:47.970 - 00:40:13.414, Speaker B: It's discussed using technology like discourse. We use snapshot for votes. And in all the votes that we've had, you know, we've basically adhered to the vote. And so we view them as like an advisory group. That's how many daos, quote air quotes daos operate. Yeah, I'm pretty skeptical on most DAO structures today. It's really, really difficult for Defi.
00:40:13.414 - 00:40:41.918, Speaker B: I think we're seeing some of the challenges. Right. We just haven't figured it out yet. Right. If you look at any of the big DeFi protocols, maker, Aave or compound, they're run by daos. And there's so much complexity, there's concentration of token ownership, there's the same types of political lobbying for key decisions. So we're really early, but I'm optimistic long term that we'll figure out a way for these structures to work.
00:40:41.918 - 00:41:09.402, Speaker B: They're also really difficult to operate in the US until we have more regulatory clarity. I think you're going to see Dow formation struggle. I think ape Dow is one to watch right now. Like the staking that just started, I think like yesterday over the last couple days, and not many people are doing it and you can't do it in the US. It doesn't really work. It seems to be off to a pretty messy start. Be really interested to watch that.
00:41:09.402 - 00:41:48.150, Speaker B: So it's hard to do pretty much anything in a DAO structure today. But that doesn't mean that long term daos are, I think they are a revolutionary way to operate. And particularly once you can have truly liquid tokens associated with functions in the DAO, meaning you can incentivize people via earning tokens for work, you can truly govern via a liquid token. You can have people coordinate in interesting ways. And we're just not there yet. And so it's going to take a couple years of experimentation.
00:41:48.530 - 00:42:08.960, Speaker A: Yeah, daos are definitely going to be interesting to watch for the future. In the interest of time, maybe. Last question. Ultimately for 2023, is there any specific thing, ecosystem, project category that youre really excited about?
00:42:10.260 - 00:43:09.344, Speaker B: Yeah, so the things that we're like really, really excited about are, so I'm particularly excited about, and this is me personally, applications that make use of public blockchains and are but to offer something that people really like already are doing, but can do it in a better way. So example would be links, meaning we can offer like there are golf membership passes, but you only get discounts to golf things. And it's manual, it's messy. If I issue an NFT, you can do composable benefits like other projects like doodles or like Knights of Degen, right. Or Yugalabs can offer benefits to our users. So because they're issued on chain and you have this on chain standard, you can actually have these projects working together seamlessly. That's exciting to me.
00:43:09.344 - 00:44:15.396, Speaker B: Another is we invest in something called Sleepogachi. It's a sleep and earn app. It's significantly more enjoyable and engaging than the auto sleep app I was using on my phone tied to my Apple Watch. And it's gamified and allows me to set up a room if I have a good night's sleep. And it's kind of like a flex and skin excited on the consumer side for things that take experiences that we're already doing and frankly improve upon them and use public blockchains and some of these mechanics to make them better and then really, really excited, as I mentioned about DeFi, like true defi. So getting people to be able to not be so reliant with centralized intermediaries, so crypto exchanges, OTC desks, the celsiuses of the world, things that are c five. And I think that will happen through easier issuance of sort of self custody and or like NPC and or smart contract wallets.
00:44:15.396 - 00:44:58.746, Speaker B: Like for example, you know, stardust works with a bunch of games and they issue, I believe, wallets right now, you know, through fireblocks and I think are looking at other partners, but they can onboard people who barely even know that they actually are self custodying. You know, they have the ability to take true ownership of their assets if they want. That really excites me. So again, it's just how do we get people? And I'm just sticking to consumer. Again, you should talk to my partner Carl and get into some of the institutional things that we're looking at. But yeah, I just, I really want more people, more fun experiences, more people using. And I think, you know, we're excited for a bunch of the games that we invested in to launch in 2023.
00:44:58.746 - 00:45:15.938, Speaker B: And I think that's going to be a really, really big catalyst because you want people spending time using applications that matter, that truly take advantage of the power of composability, but also value exchange that public blockchains allow for.
00:45:16.074 - 00:45:38.426, Speaker A: I fully agree. 2023 users and user experience. Well, really, truly appreciate you coming on the podcast, Mike. I appreciate your voice of reason, your positivity and saying things that are uncomfortable to say to lead for others. So thank you again. And, yeah, I appreciate you coming on the podcast.
00:45:38.538 - 00:45:40.474, Speaker B: Thank you, my man. Really appreciate it as well.
00:45:40.562 - 00:45:41.274, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:45:41.442 - 00:45:41.850, Speaker B: All right, I.
