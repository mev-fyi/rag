00:00:00.360 - 00:00:31.044, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's important, too. Your point about kind of focusing on the product, like, you wouldn't want to subscribe to a Netflix competitor, that their whole thing was all about which data servers they used in which regions to maximize. You want the place with good content. So it's important that good technology is built on other good technology. But we're not here to innovate on L1 s. We're here to build a functioning protocol, and we're nothing. L1 maxis or l two maxis were demo maxis.
00:00:31.044 - 00:00:31.680, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:34.460 - 00:00:41.420, Speaker B: Rob, thank you so much for joining me, and the co founder of Demo. How are you doing today?
00:00:41.580 - 00:00:43.200, Speaker A: Doing great. Thanks for having me on.
00:00:43.900 - 00:01:20.736, Speaker B: Appreciate it. We're running it back. I think we had some audio issues on the first one, so really appreciate you joining me again today and looking forward to diving into demo as we did last time. I think what I'm personally excited about is getting away from really just infrastructure products. I think there's a lot of them within. Crypto scaling, obviously, has been a big, important issue for the entire industry, but I think now we're kind of at the point where we can build interesting things. And to me, demo is up there in terms of what you guys are doing, unique approaches, something differentiated.
00:01:20.736 - 00:01:28.898, Speaker B: So really happy to have you on. Dive into the specifics, even your own journey of ultimately how this all came to be.
00:01:29.074 - 00:01:36.270, Speaker A: Yeah, and I had the flu last time, too, so this is saving everybody my flu voice. Let's do it.
00:01:36.930 - 00:01:49.102, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, maybe just to kick it off, can you tell us a little bit quick background on yourself, how you ultimately came into the crypto space and how you ended up as a co founder of Demo?
00:01:49.226 - 00:02:21.950, Speaker A: Yeah. So just before demo, I was at consensys, so I got to see a lot of really cool crypto projects. Chapters of kind of every cycle is kind of marked differently. When I first got in, it was 2017, kind of the ico era, saw a lot of projects doing that. Then there was defi summer when cryptokitties happened. I think the entire office stopped what they were doing for an entire day or two and just was breeding cryptokitties, so got to see a bunch of different chapters there. Prior to consensys, I was at vroom selling used cars online.
00:02:21.950 - 00:02:46.824, Speaker A: I never thought I would combine cars with crypto, but it's really been pretty excellent combination of experiences. And before that, the thing that got me into crypto in the first place, I was at a company called the Downtown Project. It was an offshoot of zappos.com dot CEO Tony Hsieh. He since passed away. He's a really great guy. He was trying to experiment with decentralized organizational structures.
00:02:46.824 - 00:03:24.536, Speaker A: He was implementing something called holocracy, which there's no managers. It was meant to be a big scalable decentralized.org, and we put a lot of effort into really implementing that. Super cool idea. But I think there's just some shortcomings with holocracy. But I still thought there was something to decentralized organizations. And when I read the Ethereum white paper, when I saw some of the use cases, just like on the website identity daos, that kind of thing, it's like this is the missing piece for a whole bunch of things.
00:03:24.536 - 00:03:45.710, Speaker A: And also having a finance background too, just seeing the inefficiency behind the scenes in all of our systems for HR, finance, supply chain, whatever, and knowing how much that could impact it. So I decided at that point, this is going to be Im going to dedicate my career to blockchain. Started going to meetups. Thats where I met the folks from consensys, and the rest has been history.
00:03:46.610 - 00:04:28.490, Speaker B: Thats super interesting journey. I always find it interesting because crypto originally was super niche. It started with the bitcoin crowd, fuck the government, so to speak, the anarchists trying to recreate money. And then it expanded with like the Turing completeness of Ethereum and smart contracts. And then you were like, all right, I can build unique, interesting applications. And it expanded upon that with decentralized autonomous organizations, different DaO structures, and defi nfts, the culture. Everybody has their own unique angle.
00:04:28.490 - 00:05:00.170, Speaker B: And I think it's interesting, just kind of, you approach it slightly from kind of Tony Hsieh, and I think there's been books written about him, his leadership style, and the interesting aspects there. And then ultimately that pushing you to be like, what is this Ethereum thing? And joining Consensus. How was that early time at consensus? Ethereum, still the most popular smart contract platform today. But really being there at the early times, how was that internally?
00:05:01.310 - 00:05:29.680, Speaker A: It was really interesting. Consensus was more. Well, when I first started interviewing 250 employees, I joined several months later there were 450. A couple months after that there were like 1500. And then Ethan, $85, and there was a layoffs. So it was quite an explosive time there. Consensys was characterized at the beginning when I was there mainly by a large constellation of spokes.
00:05:29.680 - 00:06:32.672, Speaker A: They call them more consumer facing crypto applications. And then there was also infuria and Pegasus and metamask. And you kind of got to see how difficult it was to build these more consumer use cases back when wallets were so much worse and when the developer tools were so much worse. It sounds like these teams were great. It just takes some time to build this infrastructure. It gave me a real appreciation and it's part of why I've been more EVM biased is just the maturity of the invisible maturity of the underlying tools and complementary infrastructure that you get as an, as a network goes further, I will say Solana's moved so much faster than I expected in its maturation there. But I got to see that obviously the metamask infura side of consensus did incredibly well.
00:06:32.672 - 00:07:16.300, Speaker A: And the modern consensus software company is mainly more infrastructure stack. The things that were more consumer really struggled to get adoption and a lot of those are no longer operating. I would describe working at consensus almost like having a fellowship or a postgrad degree in working in blockchain. Joe is an incredibly generous guy, Joe Lubin, and a lot of people were just there exploring, experimenting, given a lot of individual freedom and latitude to learn about blockchain and the industry and pursue whatever interested them. I was super grateful for that. Got to see a lot of different projects, different ways of doing things. A lot of those projects have influenced Deemo considerably.
00:07:16.300 - 00:07:18.860, Speaker A: Yeah, would do it again.
00:07:20.360 - 00:08:03.340, Speaker B: I guess internally at the time you kind of went through the boom or joined in the ladder of the boom and then went through the boss of kind of the historical ups and downs. How has that either changed your view on the space or how you approach things as a founder now today with Deemo and just preparing for what it feels like now, I feel like we're strictly in the beginnings of the bull market or somewhere, a couple innings in now versus say even six months ago, a year ago, being in the depths of the bear and things going from despair to euphoria and kind of managing the team there as well.
00:08:04.490 - 00:08:30.898, Speaker A: Yeah, the first few cycles were a lot. The first time you see eth go from was it one thousand five hundred dollars to eighty five bucks, you go, okay, maybe it is dead. That seems extreme. And then it happens several more times. Like, all right, this is just kind of the inevitable way it's going to happen. And when FTX imploded, it's like, okay, well, we're going to have a year or two of a $100 ETH again, or whatever it ends up getting down to. I was actually surprised at bottom out where it did.
00:08:30.898 - 00:09:10.834, Speaker A: I thought it would go further, further down. But there will be cycles. Another Joe Lubin quote before I even joined, I think it was in the summer I was interviewing. He was giving an interview, and this is kind of before the first, before the cycles really just kind of became inevitable and kept going. They asked about prices and all that, and he said, yeah, we're in a period with a lot of excitement and capital coming in. Then it will contract, and then it will go back up again, then it will contract every time. More capital will come into the space, the technology will improve, more developers will come into the space, and we'll build more and more of a foundation.
00:09:10.834 - 00:10:17.020, Speaker A: This was like in 2017, I think, and it's wound up being totally true. I would say the biggest difference as a builder is in a bear market, you're on a smaller stage, but it's a less crowded stage. In a bull market, everyone's interested in crypto, but now you're competing for error with 30 different dog coins and a lot of other kind of things that are going on, and people are really interested in the very short term speculative stuff. I think that I saw with the, I forget which bear market it was, but out of that came like Synthetix and Gitcoin and a bunch of other projects where it's like, wow, there's a lot of substance to these coming into a bull market, and they had a lot of momentum, and the very solid, it kind of helped to focus them and help them to identify some product market fit and so on. And so I always think of the bear market as an opportunity to really focus on adding the undeniable value. It's a terrible time to launch dogcoin, but it's a great time to be building a project with substance.
00:10:17.960 - 00:11:04.486, Speaker B: So let's dive into that. A project of substance. To me, that's a. Where I'm really excited about the space today is that we built a lot of infrastructure, but now it is actually possible to build more interesting applications because you expand past ethereums. Historically, twelve to 15 transactions per second, fees are getting cheaper on various L2s and the high throughput blockchains. And I think demo is really focused on the product side, which to me is very refreshing and trying to do something very unique in the space. Can you talk about just the journey of Teemo, kind of from idea to product to now company, and where you guys are at today?
00:11:04.678 - 00:11:28.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's important. To your point about kind of focusing on the product. Like you wouldn't want to subscribe to a Netflix competitor, that their whole thing was all about which data servers they used in which regions to maximize. You want the place with good content. Right. So it's important that that good technology is built on other good technology. But we're not here to innovate on l one s.
00:11:28.800 - 00:12:16.140, Speaker A: We're here to build a functioning protocol and we're not l one maxis or l two maxis. We're demo maxis. Right. We're trying to make sure that the demo protocol functions well, wherever that may be. So the other thing I think is really interesting about demo, too, is it started as a problem in mobility where blockchain happened to be the answer, rather than people trying to do something with blockchain searching for a problem. Not every project is like that, but a lot of them are. And the original version of demo that Andy was working on in Palo Alto was you would get out of your vehicle at a parking garage and the sensors in the garage, the garage is 3d mapped by some sophisticated camera.
00:12:16.140 - 00:12:52.910, Speaker A: There's sensors in the garage all over the place that are kind of navigating or monitoring traffic and objects and whatever. And they're talking to the vehicle to help it park itself and pay for itself. So you would get out of a Ford vehicle, the garage would talk to it, it would pull the Ford in, pull out a BMW to make room for the Ford. Kind of just orchestrate all this self driving. And if you know anything about mobility, you know just how impossible that is to imagine. I all of these automakers being on the shared permissioning and communications platform for steer by wire type applications like that, there was no digital infrastructure for it. So that was the first version of it.
00:12:52.910 - 00:13:30.524, Speaker A: The second thing that they were doing EV and Andy were working on was trying to get electric vehicle battery data and they just couldn't get it. And they were going to pay people in cash to install one of these devices. If you're listening, I'm just holding up a think about the size of a calculator that you plug into your OBD port in your car, and that way they could stream electric vehicle performance data to see how is the range doing. What are people doing, the charging habits. How are people using electric vehicles? And they're going to pay people cash. They're reminding, healing them at the same time. Like, what if we.
00:13:30.524 - 00:14:00.030, Speaker A: It's kind of like that commercial where the peanut butter truck crashes into the chocolate truck and they make Reese's cups. It's like, what if we combine this with this? That's when I got a involved. And what made me really excited about it, too, is not just the chance to use the token to solve the cold start problem. But this type of network would not be interesting to automakers. It wouldn't be viable without the blockchain distributed ledger aspect of it and the neutrality that you can get when you build a system this way.
00:14:01.210 - 00:14:15.730, Speaker B: So maybe if we take a quick step back and thank you for all that context, what is like the broader vision of demo? What is the problem that you guys are trying to solve and how do you guys go about doing that?
00:14:16.270 - 00:14:44.240, Speaker A: So cars are incredibly sophisticated hardware, like the gas engine has more or less been perfected on vehicles, and they're pretty sophisticated. Battery. They're forefront of battery technology, forefront of autonomous vehicle technology. But when it comes to smart digital, Internet connected technology, they're still really far behind. You could think of. I use the analogy all the time. You think about the progression from landlines to flip phones to blackberries to iPhones.
00:14:44.240 - 00:15:28.390, Speaker A: If you have like a 2002 Ford Focus, that's like a landline. You can't. The most smart thing about it is if you're holding the remote, you can unlock it from 5ft away. There's no real smart features to it. A more modern, you know, Ford vehicle with Ford Pass, or Honda, Honda's connected vehicle solution, or my BMW or whatever you have that's like a flip phone. There's some remote digital, you can unlock your car from another town over or something like that if somebody's standing by it, but you're still very much locked into their app and you can't do much outside of it, and you're limited to what they can produce for you, which usually is not much. Tesla is just a better version of that.
00:15:28.390 - 00:15:55.280, Speaker A: Consider them like a BlackBerry. You can do a ton with the Tesla app. You can summon the vehicle. It's pretty exciting. You can book maintenance in there, a lot of you can book maintenance through the app, but that's a better version of that kind of flip phone experience. And if you recall, probably back in the BlackBerry era, pre iPhone, that's about as smart as you thought a phone could probably be until the iPhone came out and the app store like, oh, now I. I think this is an entirely new category.
00:15:55.280 - 00:16:31.524, Speaker A: So we're trying to get to the point where any vehicle can be made smart right now. We allow cars from 2008 enough to connect, and when they connect, you as the driver is you as the owner, you can control who has access to the data and you can share it with any application you want. So defi auto loans, peer to peer car sharing. I could text you a link to drive my car for the weekend. I'm alerted whenever you leave, you know, bounds or drive past curfew or whatever. I could that, that whole self park example I just gave in the garage. Want to be able to kind of facilitate all those things.
00:16:31.524 - 00:16:48.200, Speaker A: Lead to an explosion of use cases. Kind of get to that. Like, oh, there's an app for that. Everything's digital. You can buy and sell used cars online in a few clicks, register your car on chain, not have to go to the DMV personally. So that's, that's kind of what we're building. The edema protocol enables all of that.
00:16:48.200 - 00:16:54.900, Speaker A: Then Digital Infrastructure Inc. The company I work at, is building apps and services on top of it.
00:16:56.400 - 00:17:44.054, Speaker B: Okay, amazing. Maybe just going through some of those analogies totally aligned with the early cars. They don't have over there software updates generally. They didn't even have custom networking or operating systems. Even the more advanced one today use like Apple and Android Autoplay. And then Tesla has its own custom in house. How do you kind of view either Apple and Android like, is it, what specifically do they, are they just not sharing that data? What makes those cars not as smart as a demo? Connected advice or similarly for Tesla, what makes that kind of the BlackBerry versus, like, demo as the iPhone analogy?
00:17:44.222 - 00:18:25.608, Speaker A: Let's, yeah, well, they're more infotainment, but they do gathered information on the vehicle. There's two. So one, GM recently made the decision to rip Carplay out of all of its cars. A lot of automakers allow Apple Carplay in begrudgingly because they, it's so popular with users, but they would prefer to have their own system, sort of like what Tesla and now GM has where they just control everything in the infotainment center. It's a very fragmented industry, automotive. They don't want to trust these large corporate networks. And honestly, I think that's warranted.
00:18:25.608 - 00:19:11.280, Speaker A: They've kind of proven time and time again that if you trust them too much, become too dependent on them, they'll screw you over. Like Facebook with Zynga and their games, Reddit and Twitter with their API access to their clients. Apple adding the 30% app tax and punishing Spotify and Epic Games and all that. Amazon with their Amazon basics competing with other things in the store. So it's Toyota, Geico, Aaa. They all have reason to be skeptical of Apple and, and Android getting too much power and being too core to it. We're not just like, talking about the best way to stream music inside your vehicle and unlock the doors.
00:19:11.280 - 00:19:34.430, Speaker A: We're trying to establish demo as a protocol for universal portable data and identity and communications and payments for every car in the world across every system. And for it to be that pervasive, for it to be that trusted, it needs to be neutral in a way that a corporate network can't be. So.
00:19:35.170 - 00:19:58.934, Speaker B: And is that kind of the credible neutrality is that by essentially creating this third party device that demo has created, allowing manufacturers or consumers themselves to opt in to this more credible neutrality that allows you to gather data, kind of create this more peer to peer network?
00:19:59.082 - 00:20:59.278, Speaker A: Yeah. And I should give an explanation as to how demo actually works. So when you connect your vehicle with demo, you are minting an NFT that goes on chain. And that NFT is more than just like a monkey profile picture you use for Twitter, which those are great, no hate on those. But we have on the NFT, you can set permissions for who can access your data. So you can, as the owner of it, I'm the only one who can share my location, my telemetry data, my identity data with a third party, which could be another person or could be another app that all lives on chain the connection between this device, this has a blockchain wallet on it as a secure element and it's also represented as an NFT. When I buy this and I plug it into my vehicle, I'm sending a command for it to sign a message for it to, for me to claim it and for it to bind itself to the vehicle that I just created.
00:20:59.278 - 00:21:27.776, Speaker A: So there's a three way connection between me, the vehicle and that device. And if that protocol is followed, there's nothing that can be entirely on chain. If Digital Infrastructure Inc. Were to disappear, that connection still exists forever, as long as the blockchain is still running. And that NFT also, the NFT of the vehicle points to where the data is stored for that cardinal. And right now we're the only one storing data. But in the future, it could be Toyota storing data for its users.
00:21:27.776 - 00:21:48.340, Speaker A: It could be some third party company, it could be Coinbase, Google, whoever could be running a node that stores vehicle data. So you can think of it as the directory and the permissions exist on chain, and then a decentralized network of node operators and then apps on top of that are making use of that core protocol.
00:21:49.530 - 00:22:56.612, Speaker B: Yeah, it is fascinating. I think that data of vehicles has been historically undertapped. I think Tesla has really been the first to start to experiment with that. And I believe they're also the first to do over the air software updates, being able to reconfigure the computer, gather data, telemetry data, and then monetize that data. Because I think, to your point earlier, a lot of these first generation cars, I mean, even today, cars are now just really becoming computers on wheels. And that will only continue as more and more, I would say, autonomous driving starts to be incorporated into our life. And vehicles are potentially, you viewed more as kind of a place just to get from point a to point b as these autonomous systems hopefully come online TBD on that exact timeline, but might.
00:22:56.636 - 00:22:58.636, Speaker A: Take a little longer than we expect.
00:22:58.708 - 00:23:41.352, Speaker B: It may, but I think that trajectory is one that we're definitely heading towards. And so by being able to enable smarter vehicles, collect that data, being able to build a developer ecosystem around it, you can very much see a world where this data, even today, is very much under tapped into and being able to provide better insurance quotes based off better driving car utility sharing. As you mentioned, there's many things that can potentially get unlocked when tapping into something that has not been explored yet.
00:23:41.536 - 00:24:32.356, Speaker A: Yeah, we originally started pitching demo as a way to monetize data, and there's been some cool reports that between all the traffic data, road quality data, car driving behavior data, all that kind of stuff, that you could generate about dollar 600 a year in value from a more advanced car by year 2030. I think McKinsey put out that report for whatever that's worth. We used to talk about it more in terms of we're going to help monetize your data, but that, I think, sells the vision and promise a little short. You don't get an iPhone because you can make money from your geolocation data, although I do that now with helium mobile. But you get it because it lets you access a bunch of applications. I gave a demo at Ethanver recently where it was like buying. The whole premise was buying a car in the year 2030.
00:24:32.356 - 00:25:23.680, Speaker A: And it's like this. The demo takes you through the journey of me logging into a sort of backendless NFT aggregator DaP. So all the cars listed in there are just cars that were marked on chain for sale, and it's an aggregation NFT marketplace, kind of like blur. I connect my wallet, I share some credentials about myself related to my citizenship status, my credit score, the cars that I have, I share it with that DAP. Then I go through the process of buying a vehicle, and because I share my data, it knows what cars I have already, it knows what I still owe on those vehicles. Because my loans are on chain, I go to trade in one of those cars, the money goes into the money for that and the title for my vehicle go into escrow. And when that happens, my loan is automatically paid off and the remaining cash goes towards my new car.
00:25:23.680 - 00:25:52.226, Speaker A: I get a defi auto loan for the new vehicle. Then I register the car on chain. So it's not just that. Oh, we could sell your data to somebody who wants to buy it and make you $100. It's. We can just make every vehicle commerce transaction that much faster. You drive into a service shop, they scan an NFC on your windshield, and everything loads up into their system because their system's built on the top of Veemo as well, and they can see your whole maintenance history and add notes to it and all kinds of things.
00:25:52.226 - 00:26:32.958, Speaker A: And everybody can just kind of move their data around from place to place, owner to owner, you know, owner to auction to dealer to owner again, and kind of complete these, these loops. So that's really more the promise of what we're building. And people spend $12,000 a year on their car between gas, insurance, maintenance, all that kind of stuff. And if we can make these transactions more efficient for people, more empowering, it's also very frustrating. Some of the worst transactions you'll ever engage in are in cars getting ripped off by mechanics who tell you you need something. You don't going to negotiate with a used car dealer who's just trying to nickel and dime you and lie to you about the car. You don't even know what you're getting.
00:26:32.958 - 00:27:03.134, Speaker A: All of these are solvable problems. We can make car ownership a lot better, a lot cheaper, a lot more exciting. And as this technology is getting implemented around self driving and electrification better, that's built on top of a more powerful technology platform than just built on the same kind of outdated web two. A lot of automotive is not even web two. It's like web one almost. It's like pre web. It's a lot of fax machines and dmvs and whatever.
00:27:03.134 - 00:27:09.330, Speaker A: So it's important that we build this great new era of technology on top of really good rails.
00:27:09.710 - 00:27:31.386, Speaker B: So I think the demo team and the product is a little bit unique because it's nothing, just crypto focus. Crypto is really the coordination mechanism for the product, which is, I would say, the hardware device itself. Can you share just more about the hardware device, why that's a requirement and what that actually does for the vehicle?
00:27:31.498 - 00:28:20.314, Speaker A: It's actually not a requirement. If you have a newer, if you have a Tesla, you actually should not get the device because they make the port really inaccessible and the Tesla APIs are very good if you have a newer car, if you have the Ford Pass app, if you have the my BMW app or whatever. If your car came with an app, you can likely log in. You go to download, demo, mobile and just log in with your same email and password that you use for those services to connect your car. So you can connect without the hardware. You earn less because there are some security compromises and there's actually less data that we get Tesla, we get a lot more. And you can still earn quite a bit, but the other ones, you can only refresh data every several hours, and you could combine both will often log in with their software and connect the device, earn a bit more, get a bit more functionality, but it's not a requirement.
00:28:20.314 - 00:28:38.522, Speaker A: You can get started pretty quickly. A lot of cars have that already today. And while we've been sold out of hardware, that's been the main way we've been adding vehicles. But the hardware plugs into any vehicle. The OBD port is mandated. Automakers have tried to remove it and got in trouble for it. And it's protected kind of under right to repair.
00:28:38.522 - 00:29:19.812, Speaker A: And what it does is it pulls down information. It listens to the can bus on the vehicle. So all the different systems communicate through this can bus, and it can pull information out and send it over the air back to our servers. And it makes any car from 2008 and up in a supported region compatible with Neemo, which is great for making cars that are kind of adapting those landline cars to the modern era and giving people an app for the first time for their vehicle. As I talked about earlier, too, it has some additional security guarantees. It has a secure element on there. It's minted on chain instead.
00:29:19.812 - 00:29:53.992, Speaker A: Currently 25 Deemo to mint a hardware device. And we'll eventually probably change that to use demo credits or something that's more stable and doesn't fluctuate as much, but there's a cost to produce it, to mint it on the network and connect it to a car that is paid by the manufacturer, not by the user, and we can just provide more security guarantees, trust guarantees with the physical hardware. Sorry.
00:29:54.176 - 00:30:03.740, Speaker B: No worries. I had to eat. Denver cough cold for a while. I feel like every time I go to a conference, I'm wracked.
00:30:03.840 - 00:30:08.276, Speaker A: I had the flu twice this year, so I got to skip it. At Ethan burn. It had already been. No.
00:30:08.348 - 00:31:06.770, Speaker B: Oh, no. Yeah. But with the hardware device or even just the APIs, that's interesting to the fact that that data that is being provided, I think you kind of outlined a variety of different opportunities. But where do you see this going? Like demo opening up that data they're being able to collect to third parties, to developers? Do you feel like people are going to build better applications around, giving you better insurance quotes based off your driving history? Will people build more interesting car sharing applications because you can have different read and write permissions to the vehicles at certain times? Where do you see the integration of demo going combined with the product aspects that the data is providing from the car?
00:31:06.930 - 00:31:55.380, Speaker A: Yeah, because of the actual neutrality only made possible by blockchain, I fully expect the demo protocol to be the underlying identity mechanism for every vehicle and every vehicle system. So if you're running an auction software, if you're a dealer, if you are a mechanic, the software that you'd be using, would be using right now. They all use Vin, and then maybe they plug in a Carfax API to get some other information and that's it. And every one of these systems are kind of populating all their information from scratch. They also maybe decode the vin to know the make, model, year of the car, but they have to kind of go and get all that information. We're providing a better digital version of this with more portable data. It's only logical to build on that better system.
00:31:55.380 - 00:32:39.350, Speaker A: We're not replacing a functional web two system with better trust guarantees. We're introducing a new system that doesn't fundamentally doesn't really exist. And so I think expect there to be huge demand for such a platform. And then in terms of what it enables, probably would not have guessed in 2007 that an iPhone would results in the taxi industry being completely overturned and turned into Uber. Because it's just kind of hard to imagine those all the kind of early apps were a little bit more obvious. It's like you can read books on your piece of paper now you can read books on your phone. It's an ipod with the touchscreen.
00:32:39.350 - 00:33:06.260, Speaker A: So I expect us to see some pretty basic stuff in terms of just rebuilding dealer software, auction software, fleet software and things like that, using better underlying tech, more scalable tech, but for entirely new use, cases that are hard to even imagine, especially with self driving vehicles, electrification being built on top of it, that couldn't exist without it.
00:33:07.000 - 00:33:48.420, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I am fascinated to see when you open up this new data or access, combined with even more legacy vehicles that previously never had these capabilities, what features and what data people use to build the more interesting applications. Because I think there are different plethora of ideas. It's just wandering through that idea maze, so to speak, and trying out to see what works. To me, the more obvious one on the surface is the insurance side, making, collecting driving data, being able to provide better real time insurance quotes.
00:33:50.840 - 00:34:55.704, Speaker A: A lot of people don't want their car snitching on them, although that's happening anyway. I think there was a New York Times post very recently about how somebody had their insurance rates go up because their car told on them. Basically, like this whole thing with Lexis Nexus and insurance for vehicles, a lot of heartbreaking events and such. And the thing that I think people often start a little bit skeptical or weary about the idea of demo and their data being used more and more, but we're actually the solution to that problem because we give users full control of who their data is shared with, and they can just not share it with their insurance company, or they can share only what they want to. And I imagine someone might build the safe driver insurance quote where you can get really good insurance if you share all of your information, hard braking, speeding, whatever. But this company called Metromile, I believe actually I should check on how they operate. But you could also do pay per mile insurance.
00:34:55.704 - 00:35:34.800, Speaker A: It's kind of crazy. I drive very little in the New York City, and if I were to quadruple how much I drive, my risk of getting in an accident probably goes up by four x, but my insurance premium stays the same. Insurance companies, they oftentimes will just ask you, how many miles do you think you'll drive this year? How many do you drive last year? And you just kind of tell them a number over the phone and they're like, all right, cool. It's so antiquated. It could be so much smarter. Someone could even just, you could save a lot of money by offering some type of base fee plus pay per mile that you drive. That's way less than you would pay otherwise for certain people.
00:35:34.800 - 00:36:00.080, Speaker A: So we'll enable any kind of use case like that. And you could even imagine kind of on chain car insurance applications now how the claims get paid out and who reviews them. I don't know if a DAO is quite ready for that. I've seen some people start to play around with that model, but defi auto loans definitely makes a lot of sense. You got to figure out how to repossess the cars, and Defi insurance could be another huge one as well.
00:36:01.420 - 00:36:38.000, Speaker B: Yeah, lots of interesting rabbit holes to go down in terms of things. I feel like decentralized physical infrastructure networks more broadly have been heating up since the last year or so. I feel like Deemo in large respects was very early to this trend. How do you feel like, or what do you feel like specifically? People misunderstand about demo, even if they're familiar with kind of this decentralized physical infrastructure category as a whole.
00:36:38.340 - 00:37:17.276, Speaker A: I think we've covered a lot of them. There's a lot of surface level confusion. People think that we're for electric vehicles only because at one point that is how we talked about ourselves. A lot of people think you need the hardware to connect or just the software, but you can do both. And actually, if you can do both, you should do both, so you get more functionality and better rewards. And a lot of people think that it's about just monetizing data and not about the use cases it powers. And even just data is kind of the read side, but there's also the right side too, and sending commands back to the vehicle, cars talking to each other, cars talking to sensors, cars paying for things.
00:37:17.276 - 00:38:13.304, Speaker A: And all of that's kind of in scope further down the road as well. So there's a huge opportunity there. And also it could always expand outside of just mobility, just cars. So there's a huge opportunity long term for demo, but we're going to stay focused for now, at least at digital infrastructure, I think we are. And I guess the other thing would be that we truly are trying to build a protocol. I think a lot of deep end projects, I like most of them. I think there is a distinction, though, between projects where there's a company operating a more centralized corporate network that happens to pay out rewards and tokens, versus a project that is trying to build itself as a protocol where a lot of people talk about the Bahamas test or some other name for it, where it's like, if the team were to disappear, would the project continue to run? Would it continue to exist? For Ethereum, Solana, bitcoin, obviously, yes.
00:38:13.304 - 00:38:43.998, Speaker A: There's no one, it's a decentralized group participating. There's no one person that can go shut it down, despite the rumored off switch and whatever. That's fake news. But for some deep end projects and for earlier stage projects, it's not the case. And there is this idea of progressive decentralization and getting there, but it should be a North Star for folks. It is a north Star for demo, and we get closer to that every day. And I want to make sure other deep end products are pushing that way.
00:38:44.014 - 00:39:51.078, Speaker B: As well, maybe transitioning slightly. Thank you. I think I always like to ask founders what is misunderstood, because especially in bull markets, there's a lot of things that are easier to gloss over just because most people don't dive into the details. And what I've always appreciated about the long form podcast is you really get to understand the nuance, how the team is thinking about it, the product, the product vision. I think though, the conversation more recently has kind of shifted from or been going back and forth to different scaling solutions. Some have been L2s, predominantly the Ethereum center roadmap, and then other of them have kind of shifted to Solana and other high throughput blockchains. I think we've seen other decentralized physical infrastructure networks try their own blockchain initially, or try L2s and then eventually come over to a solana or high throughput type architecture.
00:39:51.078 - 00:40:20.072, Speaker B: I know today you guys are really focused on polygon and the product, and the product that is built on Polygon. Have you, has any of the recent market movements, the uptick in user activity in these other networks? Have you guys changed your mind or how are you guys thinking about just the infrastructure side that you're built on?
00:40:20.216 - 00:41:19.218, Speaker A: Well, one thing I can say definitively, to the extent that I shaped this and our team shaped this polygon, proof of stake chain was never meant to be the long term home. And I would still even be surprised if anything that is currently out there ends up being the dominant platform in ten years. Even if it is Ethereum or Solana, it would be some level of abstraction or something that is a little bit different than what we're seeing today. And so the reason we went with Polygon early on, I should say too, we minted the token on Ethereum l one and bridged it to Polygon. And that was a nod to the idea that this is the place where we bridged to where we're playing around for now. But it's not the canonical base layer of this. I think Polygon's done some really amazing things on the business development front.
00:41:19.218 - 00:42:03.794, Speaker A: They've done some amazing things on the technology side. Their acquisition of the and their work on ZK has been incredible. They've helped to move this space forward quite a bit. Those were some of the things that influenced it. The other reason that we kind of on the polygon addition, like the low fees and all of that, is whenever you would go to some wallet application or some voting application or anything you might want to use alchemy, block explorers, whatever, top right says Ethereum mainnet, and then you click on that and the next option at the time was always polygon. And they starting to be some arbitrum optimism or noses chain or something. But it was always those two.
00:42:03.794 - 00:42:29.080, Speaker A: And we knew that we didn't have to build, we didn't have to recreate our own stuff. You want splitter contracts, you want voting tools, you want whatever, there's great solutions out there. They're audited, they work well, and they're compatible with Polygon. We don't do any custom work to get our chain id supported, all that kind of stuff. So that was really the main reason at the time. We want to be very deliberate about moving. At least that's my vote.
00:42:29.080 - 00:42:50.448, Speaker A: We'll do it eventually, but we don't want to move every year. It can't be like every year it's like, oh, now we're going to base because that's the hot one. Oh, now it's this other one. So we're going to move again now. Oh, let's go to Solana. Just come back to EVM. If we spend all of our time trying to move around chains, we're not going to develop the things that matter to differentiate demo.
00:42:50.448 - 00:43:24.218, Speaker A: So we'll probably be late to the party. Once it's sort of obvious where we should be, then we'll show up once the party's going to be fashionably late. I would at least my vote. The things that I consider, I do think performance, Ux, security, throughput, those things matter a ton. I think Salon is doing super interesting. I love their the kind of multi threaded approach where you identify which contracts you're going to touch and it makes sure they don't conflict with each other. Very smart system.
00:43:24.218 - 00:43:48.770, Speaker A: I'm a fan of Solana. I should disclose, I own Solana, I own eth, I own bitcoin. So I'm a fan of it. But that's not the only consideration. I also, as mentioned earlier, it's infrastructure. And the alchemy is hard hats, polygon scans, ether scans. But again, Solana's really advanced those pretty quickly.
00:43:48.770 - 00:44:24.712, Speaker A: Other complementary apps, like one layer up from infrastructure, like the snapshots and tallies and nosis safes and other kinds of things that we would be using to make things easier for folks. And then narrative matters too. And if it's not always the best technology that wins out. And sometimes it's just what people like the most. And again, that's been only improving there as well. So definitely watching it. No firm opinion right now, but it'll be good to see, I think, too.
00:44:24.712 - 00:44:44.742, Speaker A: The other big thing with Solana having been in the space for so long, I've seen so many Ethereum killers kind of come out, oh, this one's going to. Oh, yes, like Tron, it's going to Tezos, it's overdeveloped. Tezos is like Ethereum, but it's got better government. Oh, it's going to kill it. And it lasts one cycle, then it falls on its face and disappears into irrelevance. And I kind of assumed. I just.
00:44:44.742 - 00:45:11.150, Speaker A: I couldn't help but assume Solana would probably follow the same path. But it's especially with FDX imploding as well. But I think Solana is undeniable at this point in terms of what it's able to achieve from a place of substance. I also think Cosmos, and I've seen more people building on Polkadot again recently, but I don't pay enough attention to that one to have an opinion. But Cosmos is cool, Solana's cool, Ethereum's cool. We'll see.
00:45:12.090 - 00:46:05.080, Speaker B: Yeah. I've always just been of the point of the view that these things are here to serve the users instead of the user serve the network. And at the end of the day, products should be built by engineers that don't have to focus on infrastructure. And I think what I appreciate now is that there are a variety of different options to do. So. I think what I'm looking forward to in the future is that, to be frank, less kind of cognitive overhead, so to speak, is out there. And it's more definitive on, like, all right, for example, Solana has 10 million daily active addresses that are verifiable humans that are doing things on chain, and that's the user chain.
00:46:05.080 - 00:46:52.380, Speaker B: And if you want to do something else on Polkadot or Cosmos avalanche, they have their own niche, but it's very distinct on why someone is using that specific technology stack or product stack to achieve their product goals. And I think the sad thing to me about all this thus far is it's not very intuitive, it's very opaque, and you have to spend a lot of time doing so. But the fact that there are options out there, at least people can play around with the different options to see what works for them. But I think the approach is cracked and seeing where the chips may fall, because to your point, it makes zero sense to jump from chain to chain over time. Optimism, base, arbitrum.
00:46:54.160 - 00:47:39.896, Speaker A: It's very non trivial to move, even to move around among EVM chains, very non trivial. If you've deployed a smart contract wallet on Polygon to manage your demo, you put it into smart contract defi pools. You can't just hard fork that over to a new chain if you're managing your vehicle id NFT using a multisig or something. Those wallets dont exist on the they have to be minted or thats submitted on chain to create them on a different chain. So its a very non trivial migration even among EVM. So I want to focus on what matters for us now and yeah we are on EVM right now which would make moving to salon a little bit harder. The EBM side, the l two I agree.
00:47:39.896 - 00:47:59.312, Speaker A: The l two ecosystem right now is a mess and it's going to have to get better. And I think I'm really excited about where we're going with the universal shared sequencing, universal composability that we've been talking about more recently. Polygon with their ag layer and cross their CDK. Justin Drake on bank list to talk.
00:47:59.336 - 00:48:07.666, Speaker B: About Brendan the CTO a polygon, a technical deep dive and I think people will like that. That should come out shortly.
00:48:07.738 - 00:48:38.536, Speaker A: I'll definitely listen to that one. Yeah. So yeah and then ethereum kind of talking about doing this more natively. It's going to have to get better because yeah, where it is today, it's very impressive what these l two s have gotten to do. But to your point about user experience having do I need base ETH or optimism ETH or oh, I've mainnet Ethan in our case matic. It's like it's just, it's way too much and that yeah. Have to be cleaned up for sure.
00:48:38.688 - 00:48:49.180, Speaker B: Well maybe as we're approaching the end of the podcast, what things are you either looking forward to on the demo side or for the rest of 2024.
00:48:51.000 - 00:49:48.896, Speaker A: On our side? We've been developing demo mobile app. It's been a if you're using demo, you're mostly just using our app. We've recently gotten the APIs, the SDK to a good enough place that we can really start to see other people build awesome applications. That one just adds more value, but it also helps people unlock and realize where this is headed and how big it can be. I'm very excited when we start to have other household names, other new tech startups, whatever it is, building new and novel use cases that do something totally different than what demo mobile does that are totally different than what your car's existing app does that adds value, adds real value to your life and isn't just hey, this is blockchain. It's cool, use it. It's like hey, this is just useful, happens to use blockchain who cares? We're talking to a lot of developers where that's going to be completely hidden from users.
00:49:48.896 - 00:50:27.052, Speaker A: They won't even necessarily know about the blockchain. We'll just send the rewards to their wallet and eventually, someday maybe the app will let them know about them, or we can communicate that some other way. But the token not being at the forefront, it really just being about the utility that it can provide. That's what gets me really excited, because I think we've seen so many blockchain use cases. I know you used to be a Tesla. I always use Tesla as an example. It's like electric cars were cool as a proof of concept, and you might get one and it might cost a lot of money and have no range and be really janky, but you're doing it because you just love electric vehicles.
00:50:27.052 - 00:51:05.992, Speaker A: And then you get to a point where it starts to flip, where the cars are better than gas cars in some way. And it's kind of at that point now where if you buy a Tesla, you're buying it because it's electric and because it's a good car, not just one or the other. In the future, you won't care that it's electric. It'll just because it's a good car and they'll have to get to that because everything will be electric. But you kind of go through this transition, and so far with blockchain, most things have been, well, you should use this because it's blockchain and you love blockchain, but we'd love to get to the point where it's like, I don't care that it's blockchain, it's just useful. And we're starting to push that spectrum forward. And demo, I think, can be one of the ones to lead, help pushing that.
00:51:05.992 - 00:51:10.140, Speaker A: And that's what I'm most excited about for the project and for the space as a whole.
00:51:10.760 - 00:51:39.496, Speaker B: I love that. Maybe we can end it. On that note, building products not as focused on the infrastructure side of providing real world value. I think that is where we really need to focus on and very much appreciative of demo for taking that approach, because I truly believe that's what the space needs to get us to mass adoption. Less infrastructure, more useful products. So thank you so much, Rob, the co founder of Demo, coming on the podcast and sharing all your insights. Very much appreciate it.
00:51:39.608 - 00:51:40.360, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for having me.
