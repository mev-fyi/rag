00:00:00.440 - 00:00:18.090, Speaker A: For coming on the podcast, Z. Super excited to have you here. I initially ran into you in Spain at the Avalanche conference, and we started debating, I think it was Celestia and just scaling techniques and so really excited to have the conversation and chat with you.
00:00:18.510 - 00:00:28.060, Speaker B: Yeah, man. Good talking again. I feel like that was so long ago now, but, yeah, it was cool. That was a good conference. I hope they go back this year.
00:00:28.220 - 00:00:40.840, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it was a cool conference. I got convinced to go by a friend and really enjoyed it. Did you get to go to very many conferences last year, or are you kind of more of a homebody?
00:00:41.260 - 00:01:12.750, Speaker B: Dude, before last year, I'm typically usually a homebody, so I don't travel all that much. But last year is, like, I wanted to meet a lot more crypto people in person because been, like, following crypto forever, but really, the only crypto events I had done over, like, the past five years was, like, whenever they did. What's it called? Consensus, I think, in New York. So whenever that would happen, I would go there. Cause it's right there in New York. But I never went to the actual conference. I would just see who's in the city or whatever.
00:01:12.750 - 00:01:46.912, Speaker B: But last year, I wanted let me be more active and try and meet people, and the Avax conference was actually my first one ever, but actually my first time in Europe, too. But it was funny because it was my first time being at a crypto event after I had, like, a ton of followers, like, out of nowhere, because, like, I, like, before I, like, three or five k, like, just over the years. And, like, before I. Before the Avax conference, I had, like, 100k. So, like, I walked to the conference, and, like, I'm walking through the events and stuff, and everybody, like, recognized me. Like, oh, you're anselm. Oh, you're ansome.
00:01:46.912 - 00:01:53.786, Speaker B: It was weird. It was funny. Other than that, I did what? Bitcoin. Bitcoin and Miami.
00:01:53.978 - 00:01:54.258, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:54.274 - 00:02:01.602, Speaker B: Big on Miami and the Solana hackathon. That was cool. And then I did Lisbon. Yeah, Lisbon.
00:02:01.746 - 00:02:27.730, Speaker A: That's awesome. I went to a couple as well. I think probably the similar ones. Last year went to breakpoint, and then bitcoin, Miami, and now kind of reside in Miami as a full time crypto degen. I like the sunshine too much, so I decided to stay. But, no, I'm curious. Like, so my co founder is super good at Twitter, but I'm not.
00:02:27.730 - 00:02:38.050, Speaker A: Can you share? What are the Twitter secrets to kind of getting a bigger following? Or, like, how was that especially, like, after growing the following? Was it weird.
00:02:38.550 - 00:03:19.894, Speaker B: It was weird, dude, because, I mean, I don't have, I didn't have a game plan for, like, oh, let me grow my Twitter. Like, I'm not one of those people who is, like, trying to growth hack their social media accounts, which a lot of people are really good at and do, but I wasn't doing that for me, literally, all I was doing was just tweeting from my personal Twitter and also my crypto Twitter at the same time. So there was always an overlap there for me. Most people on crypto Twitter, they're anon accounts and they only tweet about crypto. But for me, it was my actual Twitter account that I had in college. So it was like, I tweeted about all my life stuff and then tweet charts in between and, like, tweet what I'm looking at. It was just like a mix of all that I think people saw.
00:03:19.894 - 00:03:52.470, Speaker B: Like, this is, like, an actual person. There's not, like, actual people online in crypto, like, that common. And then, like, but the thing that got me a ton of followers, I think, was just posting charts and, like, my thoughts on the market, because when markets were going crazy, like, late 2020, 2021, it's like everybody was always looking for, like, oh, what's the next trade going to be? Like, what are people looking at now? Where are all the traders? And I was doing a lot of that, like, posting trades, like, posting charts, like, what I think is going to happen next. And that's, like, how I ended up getting a lot of followers.
00:03:52.770 - 00:04:17.470, Speaker A: Yeah, that's awesome. Now, last year was, I mean, crazy, crazy year. But maybe before we kind of jump into, I want to kind of hear about, like, your thoughts on, like, the past bull market. But before we jump into that, could you just. Just give, like, a brief background on, like, how you got into crypto and got into tech. I feel like everybody kind of approaches it from a different angle and has a different story. So I'm curious.
00:04:18.170 - 00:04:46.384, Speaker B: Yeah, stories are always cool. I'm not one of the people who was, like, super early in crypto. Like, I didn't have bitcoin, like, 2013, 2014, and then, like, lost it on a hard drive or something like that. I wasn't that one of those guys, but I actually had a class, like, emerging technologies class. I went to Georgia tech, and, like, I was studying computer science. My minor was in business. And for, like, one of my courses, the focus was on emerging technologies.
00:04:46.384 - 00:05:11.058, Speaker B: And then one of the classes was on bitcoin. And my, like, professor at the time was, like, really big on it and told us what it was. Like, what the technology underneath of it, like, why it was important. I was like, 26, 2016. Honestly, like, a lot of us, and, like, my friends, we, like, paid attention, but none of us were like, oh, we're gonna go buy a ton of bitcoin right now. Like, we need to have a lot of it. So that didn't really happen.
00:05:11.058 - 00:05:54.260, Speaker B: And then when I graduated the next year, I actually had a mentor at the job I was working at, so in software engineering, and he was, like, a big crypto guy. So that's like, when I really got into crypto, was like, on Bittrex, I think I put all that trading, like Monaco and like, what all those, all those old coins, like library coin. I don't know if you remember those, but, like, although all that stuff. And I follow Kobe and all those guys, like, carpe nocturne, like ledger status. I was like, learning, trading, like, learning what crypto was. Like, why it's important in alts. And that's when I really figured out the cycle of bitcoin then alts, bitcoin, alts, and just like, how money flows in the market.
00:05:54.260 - 00:06:02.270, Speaker B: And that was invaluable to have that knowledge, like, to this next bull market. But, yeah, that's how I got started.
00:06:04.050 - 00:06:12.550, Speaker A: Pretty wild. So, I mean, studying, like, computer science is way different than trading. So what got you in the trading aspect?
00:06:13.170 - 00:06:51.356, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, I've always been interested in, like, finance and, like, cs. It's like, in high school, my, like, my favorite class was physics, so I was always, like, my, my counselor told me, oh, you need to do engineering. It's like, oh, I I picked electrical engineering and I went to, like, some electrical engineering. Like, we had some trips and, like, my freshman year, like, before my freshman year, but I was like, I don't want to do this. Like, I don't want to be in a factory, like, doing all this. And then I switched to computer science because I thought it was dope. But I've always been interested in, like, that intersection of, like, tech and finance and just, like, trying to figure out where that, like, aligns for me.
00:06:51.356 - 00:07:05.038, Speaker B: Like, I worked at a bank previously, and there's always been, like, interested in that area. But, yeah, it is very different. It's like two. Two different brains kind of. People always say computer science. People are usually not good traders.
00:07:05.054 - 00:07:50.740, Speaker A: So, yeah, no, it's. I mean, when I was, I was in the Bay area and, I mean, worked in product and so was pretty, pretty close with a lot of engineers, and I did not meet one that was good at trading. So I think you have a rare skill set, but, yeah, kind of, like, bridging though that from, like, going into, like, this passable market. Like, what were some of the things or, like, biggest things that you learned from, like, this past year? I think it's always kind of, there's always a couple of surprises. But I'm curious, like, from your perspective, either on the trading or even on scaling. Yeah. What are some of, like, your biggest learnings?
00:07:51.540 - 00:07:55.120, Speaker B: Um, like, in the transition from. From bull to bear?
00:07:55.500 - 00:08:21.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just like, what? I mean, maybe just like, a summary of, like, kind of 2021 and, like, the craziness of it or, like, I mean, was there anything that caught you, like, off guard with, like, I mean, I think you were pretty early into, like, Solana, a lot of, like, the layer one trades. Like, I guess, like, did. How did you, like, either predict some of those things? Did it, like, play out kind of like you thought? I'm curious.
00:08:21.960 - 00:08:45.500, Speaker B: Yeah. What was my thought process? So, yeah, I was, like, late to Defi in like, 2020. Probably, like mid 2020 is where I started paying attention to crypto, like, closely. Like, I've been paying attention during the bear market of 2018. 2019. But my daughter was actually born, like, October 2019. Like, those first few months, I was not looking at markets really at all.
00:08:45.500 - 00:09:29.130, Speaker B: And then I saw people talking about Defi and I look, was looking at the charts of, looked at Aave and it was like 200 x or whatever crazy, like, run up that did. But for me, I was like, oh, I've seen these cycles, like, before. I'm assuming it's going to be similar to 2017, 2018. So I was looking at ETH, looking at Defi stuff. I saw Defi run up was crazy, but bitcoin hadn't moved yet, so bitcoin was still at like ten, like nine hundred, ten k, and was just like, trading sideways. And all of the Defi people who are completely new to crypto, all in on uniswap, like, that's all that they knew. I was asking, like, is anybody buying bitcoin? Like, is anybody looking at bitcoin? And nobody, like, nobody was talking or even thinking about bitcoin, really.
00:09:29.130 - 00:09:52.126, Speaker B: So I was like, okay, I must. I know the money. Like, of all the people, like, funds and people, crypto native people, I know they're going to eventually rotate back in the bits on bitcoin. So I was like, my first really, like, main trade. I was like, bitcoin's at least going to go back to all time high. I don't know how it's going to go after that, but I know it's at least going to go to was like what I was expecting. Sounds like my first main trade.
00:09:52.126 - 00:10:31.250, Speaker B: And then, like, I don't know, was long, like breaking. I wanted to get like, really long insta all time high break. And that was like late 2020. And then, like, after that I was thinking through, like, which alts I think are gonna do well because, like, you get that first, like, major run up in bitcoin and even if, like, tops and chops around for a bit, you know, you're gonna get some alts to do well afterwards. So I was tracking altcoins and trying to catch up on what I missed in DeFi during Defi summer. And basically that entire Q four of 2020 when bitcoin was ripping alts were just getting crushed in bitcoin terms. So the USD pairs were trading sideways.
00:10:31.250 - 00:11:25.850, Speaker B: When you have that accumulation, sideways accumulation. If you have a main asset like bitcoin, Ethereum doing well, it's likely that those will break out, like break down if money rotates back into like, the lower market cap stuff. So that's why I was looking at DeFi, like, Aave uniswap. And around that time is actually when I was looking at Solana to like early 2021. I think I first bought it, like, literally first day of 2021. But my thought process around, like, which Defi tokens were going to do well, I was like, there's these basket at the top, like, the blue chip Defi ones that have already done well and I'm assuming they're going to do, like, well again. And then it's like, if ethereum fees are, like, too high for it to be, like, prohibitive for people to use because it was like people were kind of talking about that like, a little bit towards the end of the year.
00:11:25.850 - 00:11:42.378, Speaker B: Yeah, but, like, not in a way that everybody was like, oh, what's the trade? Like, what's the trade? Because of this? And, no, I'm thinking of it in, like, that way because there wasn't, like, there was no really was nothing else for people to be using that was that active at that point in time.
00:11:42.434 - 00:12:13.260, Speaker A: It was almost like if you use any other chain, you're like committing a sin. I remember with DeFi Summer, the gas fees started getting high, but it wasn't really until the beginning of 2021 when NFT started popping off, that everybody, it was like, holy shit, these are actually expensive. I think it was good for NFTs in retrospect, kind of set a floor for NFTs just because you didn't want to rug yourself below gas price. But, yeah, the narratives definitely change very quickly.
00:12:13.600 - 00:12:35.190, Speaker B: Yeah, no, extremely fast. Because the thing is, in crypto is if price confirms what you're thinking, it's like if narrative suddenly becomes so much stronger just to everybody, not even people who are actually funding this stuff, early stage. So, yeah, momentum is huge in crypto, but, yeah, that's kind of when I started looking at Solana.
00:12:36.130 - 00:12:54.910, Speaker A: And were you. I mean, even outside of Solana, you obviously have a technical background. Are you primarily looking at these charts? Are you kind of trying, like, reading these different white papers? I'm just curious, like, how you're so early to these different kind of movements even before they happen.
00:12:56.060 - 00:13:25.340, Speaker B: Well, yeah, reading. I do read, like, through the white papers charts as well. Like, you can use, like, you can set up stuff, like, locally and, like, play around with all the dev environments and stuff, like, the teams that have really good. What sort. Like, really good, like, docs around, like, all their information, you can tell, like, those are. Those are really solid. So kind of a mixture of both, but it has to be confirmed by the charts.
00:13:25.340 - 00:13:46.028, Speaker B: Like, you can be right on the fundamental side and be very wrong technically, for, like, an extended period of time. Like, you could have been. Oh, I know. Solana is, like, this great tech for all of. What year was that? Like 2020. And it was just, like Pokemon just going down. So it's like, you still need that confirmation of, like, trends.
00:13:46.028 - 00:13:57.680, Speaker B: So it's a combination of, like, the developer side and also the trader side. That's kind of how I think through stuff. I mean, like, yeah, I guess the combination.
00:13:58.660 - 00:14:16.808, Speaker A: Nice. Now, it's fascinating. I mean, I definitely come from a much more technical background and kind of the product point of view. And so I'm always envious of kind of the traders that can, like, marry those two skills because it is unique and it's not easy.
00:14:17.004 - 00:14:36.664, Speaker B: So it's hard, man. And it's like, it's really. You can be an expert at both of those things. Like, you can be, like, good at both of them, but it's really, really hard to be, like, an expert at both. I'm trying to find that balance between that. I've shifted more, like the developer researcher side recently, so we'll see how that goes.
00:14:36.792 - 00:14:58.330, Speaker A: But, yeah, yeah, I mean, maybe unlike the research side. I mean, you wrote, you recently joined as head of research, and could you share some of the things that you're excited for in 2023, or even things in the bull market that kind of caught your eye that you're still excited by.
00:14:59.390 - 00:15:43.812, Speaker B: Yeah. So recently just joined the churning group as head of research. So churning is kind of like a venture venture capital fund. TCG, crypto is like the crypto focused fund out of the larger TCG. So TCG is a growth fund, consumer focused fund. Did a lot of early stage stuff, like barstool, like food, 52 golden auctions, a bunch of stuff where it's looking at changes in consumer trends and broadcast media and how that works in a digitally focused, Internet focused age, which is how things have evolved. So then crypto is obviously the key of intersection of all those things.
00:15:43.812 - 00:16:09.868, Speaker B: Also 2023, some of the stuff we're looking at at TCG, we're looking at mobile focus applications. So we think those are going to be huge. Like, just generally, people spend a ton of time on their phones. And if you're ever looking at, like, what you think the trends are going to be in, like, the next decade, you want to look at, like, what younger people are doing now. Younger people are on their phones all the time. Like twenty four seven. And I think, like, the UX and crypto is kind of, like, lacking on.
00:16:09.868 - 00:16:22.890, Speaker B: On that side. That's like, that's one of the reasons I like Solana a ton, just because of how they're thinking through Solana mobile and the Solana mobile stack. So we'll see how that plays out. Some other stuff. Like, go ahead.
00:16:23.190 - 00:16:59.580, Speaker A: No, I mean, it is crazy just how many people actually use, I mean, their primary device to interact with the Internet is through their mobile device. And it kind of sucks today that Apple and Android really gate and the kind of crypto experience. I just did a podcast with Stephen, an engineer from Solana team for SMS and Saga. And, I mean, the fact that one, they just don't really want crypto native apps, and then two still take that 30% or 15% haircut is insane.
00:17:00.720 - 00:17:11.170, Speaker B: Yeah, dude. It's like. I know. What is it like that. What is that law that Apple passed? It's really prohibitive with the stuff on their store or like something recently that they passed.
00:17:13.070 - 00:17:14.210, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead.
00:17:14.590 - 00:17:20.330, Speaker B: I know that's why they're, like, focused on, like, Android, because, like, gives you more open source control and stuff.
00:17:22.470 - 00:17:37.148, Speaker A: It's fascinating. I mean, but I definitely echo your sentiments. I mean, the mobile stuff is going to be amazing. And I really hope, like, those native applications for crypto can be, like, mobile first. It's definitely will be something to watch.
00:17:37.284 - 00:18:15.758, Speaker B: We're going to see, man. Yeah. What's some other stuff? Like, some other stuff we're looking at? So new forms of media. So I know it's been huge this year. I feel like the people really looking closely at raw blockchain data and what you can pull out from that and the conclusions you can draw. So a lot of the reporting, I feel like it's kind of like, like you people were like reporting directly versus like outside looking in. And I feel like if you know this data intimately well, you just have like a huge knowledge advantage over everybody else, whether that be trading or just like information.
00:18:15.758 - 00:19:14.140, Speaker B: There's a barrier there. So what we're thinking through is like, how do you transform that into actual, like, media companies and, like media environments, like social media. So how do people, like, interact directly on chain and how does that work and what does that look like moving forward? Another thing we're looking at, and the last major thing is kind of like infrastructure stuff. So I know you're big on this, like the next gen blockchains. So it's like if we are looking at these applications, they're going to onboard like the next 100 million people into crypto. What infrastructure do these applications require to be able to run effectively and serve consumers? So it's like, what does that look like? What execution layer the competition at that level? Is it roll up specific stuff? Is it app chains? So just thinking through all of those different ideas and like that also.
00:19:14.720 - 00:20:12.878, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, the only. I was like an ETH Maxi and I think a lot of it just because it was the narrative at the time, prior to kind of once ETH really took off with adoption and nfts, I was so excited watching DeFi summer and all the applications and the food tokens. It was a wild time, but just seeing, I paid like $1,000 for Uniswap and I think I was longing something and had to get out of it using Uniswap. And it was just a mess at the time because everybody was trying to close their position, but that trade was $1,000 for a single trade. And I was like, oh, even though I could pay it, it pained me to do so. That's when I started looking at different ecosystems and just went down the rabbit hole. But yeah, I think on the infrastructure side, just getting more users.
00:20:12.878 - 00:20:32.720, Speaker A: I know you are a pretty prolific writer. One of the things that you wanted to see as well as users. So on the infrastructure side, are there anything particular that you were looking for or excited by? You named a couple with different execution layers and app chains. But I'm just curious.
00:20:35.060 - 00:21:24.326, Speaker B: Personally, I'm a big cosmos guy. That's where I landed towards the end, the bull market. I was kind of thinking through, like, what ecosystems are unlike, kind of, like, not looked at as closely, but like, have still a really strong, like, technical, like, tech stacks. And I was like, cosmos, is that essentially, I think it's interesting because, like, these, like, the layer ones, it's much easier to build community around because it's really just like one, one chain. Like Ethereum is like we're roll ups that settle on Ethereum signs, like we're Solana. Like, everything runs on us for composable applications. So I think with layer one, it's a lot easier to garner attention around your chain, whereas Cosmos is the complete opposite.
00:21:24.326 - 00:22:06.026, Speaker B: Everybody's focused on their own individual thing because that's how it's designed. It's app chains individually, they all communicate with each other via IBC, which is the generalized messaging system. So I do think that, like, the Cosmos SDK and Cosmos is going to blow up a lot this year. There's a ton of applications building that I think are going to do well. It's just like, how do you cultivate that community? I think, like, we saw it with, like, Luna, which obviously did not turn out well, unfortunately, but like, the way that they did that from like a business side, not like the tech side, unfortunately. It's just interesting how teams are going to go about that.
00:22:06.218 - 00:22:50.432, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. It's been interesting just talking with more engineers on the podcast and asking them what other ecosystems they've been excited about. And Cosmos continuously comes up as one that they're super interested in. I've been trying to talk with more Cosmos engineers as well, but the project, to me, I definitely agree with the general purpose layer ones. A lot of people just rally around that specific community, which makes it great. But then for the applications that actually need a more custom tailored stack, the cosmos SDK is great for that. But you lose the community aspect because there's not as many people showing it.
00:22:50.432 - 00:23:25.350, Speaker A: What I've been super interested, and this is honestly where I thought it was going to go, was sector specific. So having a Defi ecosystem, NFT ecosystem or gaming ecosystem, so you can still keep the composability aspect and also have a larger community. And I found that recently with, say, they're doing Defi focus. And so I've been super excited. Did a podcast with him recently. I'm excited about more of those type of ecosystems popping up in cosmos.
00:23:25.850 - 00:23:41.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I agree for sure. People are still trying to find the balance. Does it need to be one application or, like you said, sector specific and what the limits are? So I think it's definitely true that people are finding what that balance is. I like them, too. Some of those guys are in NYC. They're cool.
00:23:43.170 - 00:23:45.830, Speaker A: Is there a big crypto community in New York?
00:23:46.570 - 00:24:28.838, Speaker B: I think, like, there actually is, like, decently large. And I, like, was not aware of it prior to, like, last year, really. But I've been, like, more active in the community now and meeting people because previously, it was, like, I would do crypto online and then offline with, like, my friends from school, like, college, and, like, other work stuff. But now that I work in crypto, it's, like, that's everything that I do. So, yeah, it is cool to see people still, like, rallying around and coming to advance. Even, like, Lisbon, like, last year when prices were down, what, like, 90%? There was still a ton of people at that conference, and they were, like, nobody was really talking about how much prices were down. So it's cool to see, like, there's.
00:24:28.838 - 00:24:32.850, Speaker B: There's a sticky community in crypto now that's, like, relatively large.
00:24:33.350 - 00:25:00.580, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is cool to see the builders. I mean, after 2018, like, I mean, 2017 was just icos, and 2018, there was actually no products. So now it at least feels much better because there's actually products that you can use. There's not a bunch of users per se compared to, like, the web, two companies, but the community is definitely stronger. And so it's cool to see that New York's kind of built. Yeah.
00:25:01.600 - 00:25:04.900, Speaker B: I need to get back to Miami, though. I don't know. It's too cold here.
00:25:06.280 - 00:25:24.000, Speaker A: Let me know. Miami is beautiful. It's. I love it just because, I mean, we're on the computer so much throughout the day and, like, kind of glued to our screens that when it's. When I don't have to be on my computer, I want to step out and just be nice and kind of close to the beach and get some sunshine.
00:25:24.540 - 00:25:26.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel you on that.
00:25:27.340 - 00:25:59.040, Speaker A: But on the app chain, kind of like thesis or, like, general purpose, is there anything that you are wanting to actively looking for or things that get you excited or any charts that you're looking for that you're okay? I'm interested in this tech. The chart confirms this, and it's something that I'm excited to watch for the rest of the year. Or is everything just down only right now?
00:26:02.900 - 00:26:42.050, Speaker B: Good question. I've been looking at, I think some charts look good right now. I feel like I'm reverting my, revert back to my trader stage. But there's a ton of products that have been able to onboard people and you kind of see that when you see the, what is it? The trends in user activity, user growth, also align with a technical chart that looks good. I think one of those charts is actually optimism. Optimism has recently been doing well. I think it surprised a lot of people because they have a huge FDV.
00:26:42.050 - 00:27:37.446, Speaker B: This token is worthless. Why is the FTV so big? But I think that the way they're thinking about modularity, their op stack that they're working on, essentially they want to create an SDK for people to be able to build roll ups. And you can like switch out, like whether you're using like which datablob data availability layer you're using, like which settlement layer you're using, be able to customize essentially, like all of that, like under the hood, like at launch, which I think is really dope. And they also have done like a really good job of doing like their incentive program. So it's like they do, I think, like retroactive funding. I think it's called, essentially like if you're a builder on optimism and you like build an application that ends up attracting a lot of users they like will choose in the future to give you tokens. Instead of giving people tokens upfront, just air dropping all of them.
00:27:37.446 - 00:27:49.690, Speaker B: That's part of the reason why their FDB is so high. That's their go to market plan and it's worked out pretty well. And it's like, it's one of the charts that doesn't have bag holders because it's a newer chart.
00:27:50.350 - 00:28:14.680, Speaker A: That's funny. The L2s have definitely been like definitely gaining some steam. I mean, even polygon kind of onboarding a lot of different people in the ecosystem. Is there like a particular L2 that you're the most excited about? Or maybe even the L2 ecosystem more broadly?
00:28:17.500 - 00:28:56.546, Speaker B: Let me think. I think, I want to say fuel is probably like my most one I'm most excited about, dude. The guy, John Adler is super smart. Their team is really cool. But the way I think in thinking through that trade, the L2 trade is I think it's going to be similar kind of like to the layer one trade, like early last year and comparable in a way that people are going to be looking for which L2 they think is going to win, which L2 is going to be the best L2. So optimism right now has a lot of attention. But I think arbitrum, when they launch, is also going to get a lot of attention when they launch their token.
00:28:56.546 - 00:29:15.510, Speaker B: I think that potentially going to shift there and then fuel, I'm assuming. I think they're going to launch a token also, but I think they're going to be after arbitram. So I think that l two rotation is going to happen. That's one of the things I think is going to happen this year. But fuel specifically, I really like a lot. Like there's Swaylang. I think it's like a rust domain specific language.
00:29:15.510 - 00:29:39.174, Speaker B: So they're building out all the dev tooling alongside while they're building their L2. And they've implemented a ton of eips that Ethereum devs have not been able to implement in their fuel VM, which is a separate vm from the EVM. It's parallelizable and they kind of do some different things there to make it more efficient.
00:29:39.342 - 00:29:45.452, Speaker A: I do like fuel as well. I think I'm bullish of the virtual machines that do parallel processing.
00:29:45.606 - 00:29:52.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like it's a necessity, dude. I feel like it's necessary for whichever one's going to win out.
00:29:52.960 - 00:30:16.670, Speaker A: To me, it just makes a lot more sense because the modern computers just have more cores and if you have parallel processing, you can take advantage of those cores. If you don't have parallel processing, you're stuck. But it's cool that the fuel team is doing that. But I'm curious if over the long term any of the other L2s will implement like parallel processing as well.
00:30:17.450 - 00:30:41.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know, man. I feel like it's the big conversation this year for like L2 is like which ones are, what is they call EVM. EVM equivalent, EVM compatible. And then which ones are building? They're like a separate vm. So start where's like building out? Cairo, right? Cairo. And like their vm. And then it's like fuel and then it's like arbitrum and optimism, like more on the EVM side.
00:30:41.724 - 00:30:48.012, Speaker B: So that's like a big competition. I think that's like one of the coolest discussions that we're going to see.
00:30:48.196 - 00:31:09.610, Speaker A: It will be a good battle and then all the data availability layers. That's super interesting to me as well. And some people have, I think it was arbitrum. They're building their own custom data availability layer polygon as well just to keep like transaction costs relatively cheap for settlement.
00:31:10.390 - 00:31:13.358, Speaker B: Yeah, I think arbitram Nova I want to say it's called.
00:31:13.414 - 00:31:13.902, Speaker A: Yep.
00:31:14.006 - 00:31:15.198, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:31:15.294 - 00:31:26.650, Speaker A: So it's, I don't know, the whole scaling debate, like, to me is, like, super interesting and kind of following along with it. But yeah, the L2 is, like, will definitely be interesting to watch this year.
00:31:27.230 - 00:31:52.410, Speaker B: But it's cool because, like, the people who are writing the actual, like, academic papers that define all of these terms, the people who are arguing with each other on Twitter about, like, which solution is better. So it's cool that we're, like, at the front lines. I don't think there's really any industry where you get to talk literally to the people who are writing, like, the foundational stuff for the industry. So that's really dope. One of the reasons I like crypto so much.
00:31:52.870 - 00:32:27.230, Speaker A: I fully agree. I mean, Twitter, Twitter is too addicting, to be honest. I'm all the time. But no, I mean, I got got into, I mean, crypto in 2017 and really kind of fell down the rabbit hole through Reddit first. And I did like, Reddit, but then there's a lot of dormies, and so you kind of have to go through, like, a bunch of comments to find, like, who's kind of making good points. But Twitter, like, you can actually find the people, like, you said that, like, you're actually writing this stuff and talk with them directly, and it's just a way better experience.
00:32:27.890 - 00:32:31.750, Speaker B: Yeah. The access that we have is crazy. It's way better. I agree.
00:32:34.100 - 00:32:51.160, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the L2 side, bullish. Layer twos, bullish, different app chains and the cosmos ecosystem, are there any other l one s that you're focused on or any interesting dapps that you've been following?
00:32:55.340 - 00:32:59.952, Speaker B: I still like Solana a ton. I think the improvement.
00:32:59.976 - 00:33:03.568, Speaker A: Even after kind of FTX and the blow up.
00:33:03.744 - 00:33:33.602, Speaker B: Yeah, even after. Even after FTX and the blow up, honestly, like, more, dude. Because, like, I feel like as a chain, like, anatolian, their, like, dev team has done a ton, like, implementing fixes to address all the issues that they've had, like, congestion and like, that. Like, the chain down time. Like, the few times it has gone down, they've implemented a ton of stuff, like quick stick, weighted, like, quality of service, like the, what is it? The fee markets, like, on individual, the dynamic fee markets.
00:33:33.626 - 00:33:34.090, Speaker A: Yep.
00:33:34.210 - 00:34:14.934, Speaker B: Yeah. That's, like, one of the things I actually get pushed back on when I say, like, the app chain thesis is like, oh, well, Solana has, like, priority fee markets localized to these individual applications. So it's like, if you have a ton of applications, running on Solana and, like, just one application is like driving, like congesting the chain, but that application doesn't affect all the other applications running. And it's like, why do you need an application specific chain if this application doesn't affect all the other apps running on Solana? So that's like one of the good, I think the good arguments I've had with people, it's like, if localized fee markets work really well, do you need, like, roll ups? Do you need app chains? So that's another interesting spot.
00:34:15.102 - 00:35:09.719, Speaker A: No, I fully agree. I mean, I think, I mean, I think Solana was the first doing like, paralyze virtual machine, and then definitely the first with fees per contract. And I've talked with, I mean, the Sui team or the miss and lab team, and then also the Aptos team and both. I think Aptos wants to implement in the long term fees per contract, but Mistin lab is going to have fees per contract at launch. And then I think the fuel team ultimately wants to do fees per contract as well. But I think that you have to have paralyzed virtual machine for that to happen. So I'm interested to watch the single threaded or the EVM chains, and over time, if they pivot to paralyzed virtual machines and fees per state, because to me, it just makes a lot more sense.
00:35:10.579 - 00:35:29.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. I've been saying it for a while. Ethereum people didn't like me in 2021 because I always was like, are you all sure the EVM is going to be like the long term winner? Go back and forth with them. But yeah, I agree.
00:35:31.390 - 00:35:46.330, Speaker A: Maybe jumping to Ethereum, I think it was awesome. They transitioned to proof of stake, and now they're doing the roll up centric point of view for scaling. What are your thoughts on ETh going into this new year?
00:35:47.390 - 00:36:28.540, Speaker B: I think ETH is really strong. I think, like that transition, you kind of see how the economics have shifted because it's been like deflationary, almost broke my chair. It's been deflationary a few times this year. And I think if we get the sustained activity that we had in the bull market, I think there's a good chance that it remains deflationary, which is a really strong narrative for Ethereum. I honestly, the way I look at Ethereum is like, it's the safest bet. Like, in crypto. Like, they move very slowly, but like, when they do, like, push, like, all their upgrades, you can be confident or in thinking that, like, yeah, like, this is not going to break.
00:36:28.540 - 00:36:46.260, Speaker B: Like, I feel comfortable using the EVM like, it doesn't change all that much. And, like, I can limit kind of, like, the, like, technological innovation on, like, the roll ups. So it's like, I think Ethereum is one, like, the safe bet for people, in people's minds. I think it's going to do well.
00:36:47.040 - 00:37:17.510, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been fascinating to watch, Ethan, all the research that they've put out, but I definitely agree now. It's kind of the safe bet in 2018. Betting on Ethereum at that point in time was the contrarian thing, and now it's kind of the de facto standard that everybody's voting to win, which doesn't mean, like, it won't win, but, yeah, there's. It's. I'm curious to see, like, them just transition to these L2s and how it will work out over the long term.
00:37:18.530 - 00:37:38.376, Speaker B: Yeah, same. I'm very interested in how it plays out. The one thing I don't. I don't like about, like, ethereum is like, that argument around, like, fees, and how fees are like, oh, this is a, like, we're like, there's a. The chain is making a ton of revenue because the fees are high. I hated that argument in, like, 2021, because I just. It's not sustainable.
00:37:38.376 - 00:38:04.014, Speaker B: It doesn't make sense. But I like more is, like, the argument around meV. And, like, if you have a ton of activity on the chain or that be on roll ups or, like, on Mainnet, it's like, the value that you get from people reorganizing blocks and, like, all of that, like, the mev from there, whether that's redistributed effectively to users or, like, in another way, I think that's a more, like, long term solution.
00:38:04.102 - 00:38:38.010, Speaker A: For how blockchains can be profitable, 100%. And I think that will be a good narrative going into or for 2023, the mev conversation, I think we really didn't have good words to talk about it in the passable market or people just weren't knowledgeable enough. And then once we got all this activity and even defi, now it's become a much bigger conversation. And so I know you're a fan of, like, geeto. Are you a fan of, like, any other, like, mev services?
00:38:39.230 - 00:38:47.850, Speaker B: I need to look closer. I like the other ones. I know there's. What are the ones on Solana? There's one working. What's the one working with, say, is it skip?
00:38:49.310 - 00:38:50.330, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:38:51.070 - 00:39:22.878, Speaker B: I don't know if it's skit protocol or, like, another one. Another. Another cosmos. Focus mev team. I know there's one like, working with, say, I think like, that's actually a good opportunity. It's kind of like Mev on these alternatives, like layer one chains or like app chains, and just like thinking through how that's going to work because it's going to be the same argument that it is on Ethereum on like all of these other chains that end up going well. And you kind of like, you have flashbots, which is like the de facto standard, but it's like, what other teams are going to focus on that because it's not the same.
00:39:22.878 - 00:39:25.830, Speaker B: It's not going to look the same as it does on Ethereum.
00:39:26.210 - 00:39:35.310, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely true. What do you think about perps and decentralized perps?
00:39:37.930 - 00:40:44.410, Speaker B: Well, I think. I think one of the strong GMAX has been one of the strongest alts, which I kind of did not expect, like, the past summer. I was not like, the guy was like, yeah, GMX is going to do better than everything else and it's like one of the ones that's like, done really, really well. I think that the way that they've structured incentives for like, traders and like LP providers is really interesting and it's like, in a way that differentiates themselves from like, decentralized alternatives. The toughest thing for decentralized perks is how do they provide a platform where people who are trading like large size don't suffer from like, these latency issues that they would never have issues with on something like binance? So it's like, I don't think any platform and current state has been able to replicate that, which obviously it's really hard to do and they're not going to get to that same level. But it's like, how close can they get to the point where a lot of people use them other than just retail, who's trading on uniswap?
00:40:45.110 - 00:41:03.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I really want the latencies to be super low and I think that was my, or I guess, kind of bullish for some L2s that you get like the soft confirmation latency, but. Or like the high throughput chains and the lower latencies, but yeah, the latencies are definitely an issue.
00:41:04.060 - 00:41:04.396, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:04.428 - 00:41:14.640, Speaker A: What do you think on the latency stuff? The thing that like, just came to mind was like layer threes. Do you have any thoughts around, like, their layer threes?
00:41:15.820 - 00:42:49.254, Speaker B: It's like, I feel like we just started on L2, dude, and I agree, and now we're already on layer threes. But like, for me, like, the way I'm thinking through I need to go deeper on this, but the way I'm thinking through it now is like, you have application, you're going to have application specific roll ups, and you're going to have generalized roll ups, right? So where layer threes come in is like when you have these generalized roll ups that are usually on Ethereum from what I've seen, and then you have these application specific roll ups, which are going to be l three s, like for games or whatever else that then go back on top of these generalized roll ups. But alternatively, you can have literally application specific roll ups at the l two level instead of at the l three level. And there are some teams working on that. Dimension in Cosmos is one of the teams I mentioned in Celestia one of the teams, some of the teams of cosmos that are thinking through that. From my point of view, the reason that l three s is a narrative is only because Ethereum was like the de facto l one that these were left are getting built on. So it's like if you have a really performant base layer, which Ethereum is not, but if you do have a really performant base layer, then, like, you can go directly to application specific roll ups instead of building these generalized roll ups, because it's like, you wouldn't really, I don't think people would like the argument for building a generalized roll up on something like Solana is not as strong as like the argument for building a generalized roll up or something like Ethereum.
00:42:49.254 - 00:42:54.890, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's kind of how I've been thinking through it, but I need to go, I need to go deeper on it, dude.
00:42:55.790 - 00:43:23.110, Speaker A: I agree, though. I mean, I feel like, I mean, really, the conversation was like shifting from like, scaling the l one to scaling the L2 on ethereum, or using L2s to scale Ethereum, and then they're like, oh, surprise, layer threes. And like, it just, it adds a lot of complexity. Complexity. And so I've just been surprised by it and, but I'm curious, definitely curious to watch it play out.
00:43:24.010 - 00:43:38.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what's, what's, what's the team, I think it's ZK sank has been the main ones talking about it. Right? Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm interested too, man. I don't know. I don't know how they're going to sell it to people because I feel like selling roll ups was hard enough as it is.
00:43:39.330 - 00:43:40.110, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:41.260 - 00:43:44.920, Speaker B: Are the l three is going to be a completely different vm and language, too.
00:43:46.860 - 00:44:27.900, Speaker A: To me, it's just like the more complexities that you add one from the software side for developers, but then also users bridging from an l two to an l two or an l two to l three. It's just complex, it's hard. I'd rather. That's why I'm a big fan of the kind of high throughput systems that try to keep everything on a single shard just because it's easier for developers and it's easier for users to navigate it. But I think on that front, like, ethereum is very, very good at telling stories. Why do you think these are, why do you think these other ecosystems are not as good? Just like Ethereum has a bigger community.
00:44:28.640 - 00:45:02.690, Speaker B: Man, I don't know. The Ethereum guys, you guys are impressed with that? That's one thing I will say for sure. The narrative, the control of the narrative, they are super, like really, really good at that. Their whole, like, content and how they like, produce content and convey it to people is really strong. I don't know, I feel like Solana is like kind of good at it, but like even they're not, they're not like as good because, like, there's not as many people that understand localized fee markets and like, what quick is like, what all the upgrades are. It's like, no way, not at all.
00:45:02.730 - 00:45:48.690, Speaker A: I mean, I'm continuously impressed by people that I talk to in the Ethereum community will name the EIP and the number, and then they'll be able to articulate everything. Where in Solana, localized fees with jump and the fire dancer client. I think at the Solana breakpoint event with fire dancer, they demoed on pretty standard hardware with good amount of cores, I think, like 24, 32 cores. Solana hardware doing like. Or the fire dancer client doing 600,000 tps and like, but you really don't hear the community, like, talking about that or really showing it too much. And so, yeah, ethereums, they're pretty good.
00:45:49.310 - 00:45:57.730, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know, maybe it's like a time thing because I feel like a thing has been around for like much longer. Well, they probably have like, what, how many years? Like a.
00:45:58.250 - 00:46:00.350, Speaker A: It launched in 2014 or 15.
00:46:00.770 - 00:46:14.930, Speaker B: Yes, somewhere around there. So kind of like five, six year head start on like these other chains. That might be why, like there, those are people like, that have been reading the Eips, like, since they started. So it's like, that's, that's definitely made like a good, a good reason.
00:46:14.970 - 00:46:53.370, Speaker A: I think the, I think the wealth effect happened or helped a lot too. I mean, with everybody getting the opportunity to buy, well, a good amount of people getting the opportunity to buy ETH at the ICO and then a couple of years prior to all the icos happening and then kind of got the second chance when ETH went to 1400 to 80. Now with Solana and some of these other l one ecosystems, I mean, Solana went from 200, 4260 to what was it, eight. So people having a second redemption at that as well. So it will be interesting.
00:46:54.070 - 00:47:07.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting for sure. I've always been like a bit biased to Lana because like, I literally bought it like a dollar 50. So. So, yeah, I've always been. I feel that like that wealth effect is definitely like real.
00:47:07.750 - 00:47:15.610, Speaker A: Yeah. What are your thoughts, like, anything particularly on like the NFT side or like gaming front that you're like looking forward to?
00:47:17.190 - 00:47:37.860, Speaker B: Yes, I really think, I think I played. I played a game on Solana the other day. It was actually pretty cool. Is a first person shooter. It was like, okay, it was mini, it was mini royals or mini, mini something, mini royal or mini nation or something. It's like really dope. It's like you didn't even cuz, like what I was just playing, like you would play a regular game.
00:47:37.860 - 00:48:20.614, Speaker B: So one of the interesting onboarding pieces, I think for these games is like, can you play it without a wallet initially? And then like, can you like after that be like, oh, if I use a wallet, then I get all these other like, in game upgrades and like, I get to track all my like, stats and like my wins and losses and like, I get like access to different nfTs. I think the go to market of these games, like how they do that, it's got to be like, it can't be just for crypto native people. I think there's going to be like the games that focus on onboarding everybody and then there's going to be like on chain games that specifically target crypto native people. They're like two different like, segments, I think. What's some other stuff I'm looking and.
00:48:20.622 - 00:48:25.850, Speaker A: You think primarily that is because like the self custody in the wallet aspect.
00:48:28.550 - 00:48:57.190, Speaker B: Not, I mean, not really. I just think like people that just don't know anything about crypto, they should like be thinking, I want to play this game because a fun game, not because it's a crypto game. And I do think there are games that are going to be specifically tailored to people who are on chain a lot and those will grow in their own way. But then the other side of it is a different target market. What other games?
00:48:59.370 - 00:49:12.750, Speaker A: I know you were big into or at least tweeted a little bit about DFK and I think Axio Infinity as well. Are you like still excited about like play to earn games?
00:49:15.330 - 00:49:15.722, Speaker B: I think.
00:49:15.746 - 00:49:19.510, Speaker A: Or is that just like a bull cycle thing?
00:49:20.370 - 00:50:08.228, Speaker B: The economy, the economies have to be like constructed in like different ways, I think, like the bull market valuations were just like way too high. Like the prices that people were paying like up to earn in game were just unsustainable for the average person and that's why like all of them broke. But it's like if you have a game that has like a sustainable economy where it's like you don't need to pay a ton of money to play upfront, but you can earn from participating, like whether that be through micro transactions or like items that don't cost a ton of, like, I think that can work because play to earn games exist outside of crypto games. Like World of Warcraft was like a play to earn game. Like if you played World of Warcraft, that was a play to earn game.
00:50:08.364 - 00:50:18.196, Speaker A: I played a lot of World of Warcraft. I don't play anymore because I would get sucked back in. But I played a lot of World of Warcraft and runescape back in my day, bro.
00:50:18.228 - 00:51:05.570, Speaker B: I played, I have years long from that game, literally. But like if you were doing all those, like, I forget what they were called, like the tailoring and like the jewel crafting, like all that stuff. If you were like really grinding farming, putting hours into the game, like spending in like game in game in like hours in game, you like got profit from that because you could like sell yourself on the auction market. And then I had a tangible value in like real life because people would pay for the time spent in game. So I think like in crypto that can happen in the same way, but it's just so much easier to distribute that through like nfts on like everything on chain and just like tracking your progress like over time. I don't think anybody's done it really well yet, but I definitely am still bullish on that.
00:51:05.990 - 00:51:30.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I would love a World of Warcraft or Runescape style game with nfts. That'd be amazing. But no, I think just looking at doing analytics and how few users there actually are and thinking about if you got one popular game, you could really onboard the entirety of the existing crypto users today, which I think gets me super excited.
00:51:30.570 - 00:51:46.950, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, legit. I've literally been thinking about this, that in the same way that's kind of how I was thinking about DMK. I thought I was going to do like really well. It did do like really well for a bit. But the games that like do that and they're sustainable like long term I think are huge. I don't know if you've looked at like.
00:51:48.890 - 00:51:49.954, Speaker A: What I mean what are the.
00:51:50.002 - 00:52:19.108, Speaker B: Two popular ones like Alluvium, they haven't launched their like main game yet but they have stuff in beta Traverse I think. Looks pretty cool. Yeah, there's, there's stuff like that. We actually have actually like one of TCG's like portfolio companies, Curio, they're launching like an on chain game treaty that's like launching pretty soon. But there's like, there's a ton of different, different games. I think this year it's like this is the year after people have spent a year plus in development.
00:52:19.284 - 00:52:23.692, Speaker A: Yeah, that's like a thing. Yeah, it's actually like building up the game.
00:52:23.836 - 00:52:33.320, Speaker B: Yeah, like games take a long time to make and crypto is like way too fast for the pace, I think, of developers.
00:52:34.300 - 00:53:00.630, Speaker A: I do agree. I'm excited for them to actually launch and see which ones have the sticking and staying power because they could definitely bring a lot of users. On the TCG side, you said you were interested also on some of the social aspects of. Is there anything that you guys have been following on that front that like you're excited about for this year?
00:53:01.530 - 00:53:58.250, Speaker B: Yeah, so like some of our portfolio companies, what's one of them like medallion? I really like them. They're really cool. So they focus on like the intersection of like music artists and their fans. So it's creating like a dynamic relationship wherever like the fans are able to track like their entire history of like their fandom over time and then interact with other fans socially, like a social media application and like see who else is at this concert or this concert. Just like a whole interface for that. It's like, because typically it's hard for music artists to go directly to like, oh, who's my number one fan? Or like which person was at this concert? Like how do I contact this specific subset of people? And blockchain and nfts make that like a lot easier for artists and fans to connect in that way. That's like one of the teams that I like a lot.
00:53:58.910 - 00:54:22.340, Speaker A: The creative stuff is super exciting. I'm excited for that as well. I mean, there's not very many good avenues today. I think YouTube probably pays the best with, I think 50% of ad revenue is shared with creators. But other ones. I mean, Twitter, I think, with Elon purchasing now, is trying to do some of that, but I'm curious to see what Twitter does.
00:54:22.760 - 00:54:57.690, Speaker B: Yeah, dude, like, one of our. Another one of our portfolio companies, like Glass XYZ. So they're essentially that, like, the decentralized YouTube was actually on Solana, but it's like, creators get paid, like, for their videos directly, person to person, instead of, like, the. The way that these huge corporations take such a large cut of everything. So that's how we're thinking through a ton of these consumer interactions and relationships. And how can blockchain and nfts make these relationships a lot better? Whether that be for creators or fans or all these different industries.
00:54:58.790 - 00:55:12.726, Speaker A: I love it. No, I'm definitely excited for that as well. It's needed. I feel like it will kind of become a more dominant jamba in the future. So trying to get ahead of it with all the podcasting stuff, but definitely.
00:55:12.798 - 00:55:21.262, Speaker B: Yeah, man, that's the way to go. I, like, been tracking. I've been tracking your pod. I feel like when I met, like, when we met, you didn't have. You didn't have the pod.
00:55:21.406 - 00:55:55.264, Speaker A: No. I mean, so I was at Tesla and ultimately decided to leave and spent a year just, like, doing research. And, like, I felt like a crypto. I felt like I knew a lot after just, like, being on crypto Twitter and, like, reading white papers for a year. But I didn't know how to be involved in, like, the community, and so I was always jealous of, like, the people that were good at Twitter because I felt like there was the meme where, like, everybody's dancing, but that person's in the corner. I always felt like that. I always felt like that person in the corner, man.
00:55:55.264 - 00:56:21.660, Speaker A: I was like, I know about blockchain, but, like, how do I talk to people? And so I was like, fuck it. Like, I'm gonna buy a podcast stuff and just, like, start talking with people. And at that avalanche event, I met Kevin and convinced Kevin to come on the podcast, and him and I nerded out about avalanche, and then it kind of, like, snowballed from there. And so, yeah, that was, like, at the very beginning, dude.
00:56:21.700 - 00:56:49.110, Speaker B: No, it's been sick. I agree 100%. It's funny, actually. When we were at the conference, like, my girl was with me. She was mad at me. She's like, who are you talking to for, like, 20 minutes? You said you were gonna leave, like, 15 minutes ago, and I was, like, talking to you, other guy about, like, Celestia, just, like, going on and on and on and on because, like, I didn't, I was like my first outside, like, really in person event where like, I'm actually talking about crypto and you just like, start. Just go, go, go.
00:56:49.110 - 00:56:54.978, Speaker B: So it's definitely been cool, man. Like, you've had some, you have some great people on. It's been, it's been dope.
00:56:55.114 - 00:57:13.770, Speaker A: Yeah. Appreciate it. It's been fun. I mean, to be honest, like, being able to talk with people, like, you learn kind of like how you think about the markets. Like, from the trading aspect. Like charts, like being able to talk with builders directly. Like, it's been amazing and definitely, like, recommend anybody try to do it.
00:57:13.770 - 00:57:18.130, Speaker A: It's hard in the beginning, but once you get a little bit of momentum, it keeps going.
00:57:18.830 - 00:57:21.530, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. It's been dope. Dope to see.
00:57:21.910 - 00:57:52.910, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Well, maybe kind of wrapping up the podcast for like 2023, I guess. Like, where do you think things will kind of ultimately end up? Like, do you think, I mean, there's a bunch of, it's hard to predict these things, but I mean, is there any, like, I would say, like, specific catalysts that you're looking for or things that you think will kind of push the market forward or do you think it's gonna kind of be history repeats itself? Like 2018? 2019?
00:57:55.770 - 00:59:28.220, Speaker B: Let me just say first, as a personal opinion, of course, let me not get in trouble. But yeah, I think, like, I, this market is going to be similar to 2019 in the way that you have majors kind of rebound off their bottoms and, like, you get some kind of sustained rally, but it's not necessarily all the way back to all time highs, but in that if you have like bitcoin and ethereum trading and arrange and, like, chopping around during those, like, intervals of that, like, accumulation phase, that's when a lot of the innovation happens during these bear markets in crypto, whether you want to call it like a bear, like in between Bear and Bull, but that's when, in 2019, that's when all the defi stuff got built out. That's when Chainlink had its first major run. So I think that this year, you're going to see similar things happen, whether that be with LSD's like Lido and stuff like that doing really well, or whether that be new Cosmos app chain launching stuff like save and they do well, or whether it's roll ups and they find their, like, product market fit and like these, there's like some, like, explosive application, like on board the ton of users and it's like, on a roll up. So I think, like, you're going to have a ton of innovation on the infrastructure side as well as, like, the application side. And it's really just going to be, like, actively who's, like, actively looking for these things and is, like, early to them because you have to be, like, you have to be very, very active in crypto. Like, you want to be the person that's, like, on all the testnets.
00:59:28.220 - 01:00:15.974, Speaker B: Like, oh, why were you like, why are you testing this out? It's like, because I wanted to learn about it, not because I'm, like, looking for an airdrop and they told me I was going to get one. It's like the people who find this stuff early are the people who are doing all that reading through the docs and protocols when they're just talking on Twitter and don't necessarily have a product out yet. And that's also the way you build relationships with people in crypto because it's like, it's rare for people to show that initiative before prices, like, confirm everybody's narrative or conviction. So, like, even if you're just like a regular retail person, like, on Twitter, I'd say, like, reach out to people, be active, do all that. Because, like, they're definitely going to be opportunities this year a lot more, I think, than we had last year, like, to do well.
01:00:16.022 - 01:00:34.970, Speaker A: So, yeah, beautiful advice. I I would definitely echo that. And then, so if people want to get in contact with you or TCG on, like, the investment front or learn more about what you're doing, what are the best places?
01:00:35.630 - 01:00:52.504, Speaker B: Best way is definitely Twitter. Like, dm me or Twitter. My telegram is my old ad, so I'm kind of, like, less active on there. But, yeah, dm on Twitter. I can give out my emails and all that information. If teams want to reach out, people want to reach out just to talk and chat stuff. I'm always down.
01:00:52.504 - 01:00:53.980, Speaker B: So cool.
01:00:54.280 - 01:01:07.740, Speaker A: Well, I really appreciate you coming along, podcasty. Been a longtime fan of your Twitter and of all your calls. So appreciate you sharing your wisdom and given some of your thoughts on the market.
01:01:08.160 - 01:01:10.408, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me on, man. It's been fun.
01:01:10.584 - 01:01:11.120, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
