00:00:00.280 - 00:00:29.130, Speaker A: I think that Solana and Celestia share that mentality of, like, hey, we need to have abundant block space. Like, fees should be low for everyone because otherwise you, like, you know, it's sort of like that what that infamous tweet that Vitalik did of, like, the Internet of money shouldn't cost, like, five cents per transaction or whatever, right? Like, I actually agree with that sentiment. And so I think Solana and Celestia are very aligned there. But then, where they differ slightly is the emphasis on verifiability.
00:00:32.750 - 00:01:15.520, Speaker B: Well, Nick, thank you so much for joining me. Super excited to have you back on the podcast. It was funny, I was looking at our old podcast, the first one that we did, and I flew to New York City to make sure that I could talk with you and really learn as much as possible about what you guys were doing at Celestia. And honestly, just kudos to you and the entire Celestia team for as much progress as you made. I think at that point in time, when I came to New York, you guys were still on testnet. Now you're live, and a lot of things have happened since then. So looking forward to covering that gap and ultimately looking forward to the future and articulating where's the end road for all these blockchains.
00:01:15.520 - 00:01:19.860, Speaker B: So I'm really looking forward to the conversation, and I think the audience will, too.
00:01:20.320 - 00:01:38.540, Speaker A: Well, thanks, Logan. I remember that really well. You were just starting out with frictionless, and I remember you're also starting out with the podcast. And I remember you're like, no, I want to do that in person. You flew out. That was awesome. And, like, one of the, one of the most technical podcasts I've done up until that point.
00:01:38.540 - 00:01:58.640, Speaker A: And so I think it was a really good foundation. And, I mean, I have to give you a lot of credit for everything you've achieved. And also, you were one of people who was super bullish on Solana back then, right when things were kind of at the nadir for the Solana community. And so, I mean, I give you a lot of credit, too.
00:01:59.020 - 00:02:37.540, Speaker B: Thank you. Well, I think the funny thing, and we'll get into it in this conversation, is it all converges. Solana, Celestia, in some regards. There's obviously some philosophy kind of differences that we'll kind of highlight. But I think to Vitalik's credit, he really articulated the endgame fairly well in his blog posts. So maybe if we could just start it out there. Where do you see the endgame of all these blockchain architecture designs and how is Celestia's point of view, if any, different from these other blockchain architectures?
00:02:38.320 - 00:03:14.188, Speaker A: Yeah, we're all trying to reach the end game for blockchain infrastructure. What the end game is is it preserves all the important facets of what blockchain infrastructure is supposed to provide. Right. It should be, there should be a lot of throughput so we can support all the different use cases and users around the world. It can be like a global scale infrastructure. So throughput is a big one. And another one is verifiability because you need to enable end users to verify the chain in order for the blockchain to actually be worth anything.
00:03:14.188 - 00:04:13.016, Speaker A: Like the whole point of a blockchain is that you can audit it and check that everything that is happening is legit and nothing is being cheated or stolen, et cetera. So verifiability is another major component then. The last one is this notion of censorship, resistance, or anyone should be able to access them at any time and you shouldn't be able to be excluded. They should be a universal, permissionless platform for people to use. Those are the three things at least that Vitalik highlighted in his post. I think all blockchain infrastructure is heading in that direction in one way or another, because if they don't fulfill any one of those, then they've kind of failed at providing what it is that blockchains are supposed to provide to the world. For the first one to scale throughput, you have to scale block production, meaning you need more block space for people to run stuff on.
00:04:13.016 - 00:04:54.690, Speaker A: And there's a lot of different, I mean, like no matter how you slice it, block scaling, block production means you need bigger nodes. I mean, you could also do it via sharding, where you have lots of different nodes, like smaller nodes with parallel chains. But then sharding kind of has all these complexities. So why not just put it all under one like larger network? And I think so that's something that Sana and Celestia definitely share is like, hey, it's okay to have larger validator nodes because that's the only way that you're going to scale block space and you should optimize the crap out of those nodes and that protocol to make it so you can get the most juice.
00:04:54.990 - 00:05:46.980, Speaker B: Maybe if I could jump in there. I think it's been interesting because you and I have been talking about data availability for a long time, saying that hey, you need more throughput, you need larger blocks. And I mean, this kind of commentary has or debate has been going on since the inception of the industry with bitcoin and the block size debate, I think it's now interesting that this has really come to the fourfold, especially as things start to heat up a little bit within kind of the ethereum ecosystem and more broadly, having more expensive block space, I think, is going to be a continued issue, at least for these early networks like Ethereum, that may have higher fees compared to a celestia or Solana.
00:05:47.960 - 00:06:22.320, Speaker A: No, definitely. And that's why I think that Solana and Celestia share that mentality of like, hey, we need to have abundant block space. Fees should be low for everyone, because otherwise it's sort of like that infamous tweet that Vitalik did of the Internet of money shouldn't cost like five cents per transaction or whatever. I actually agree with that sentiment. And so I think Solana and Celestia are very aligned there. But then where they differ slightly is first of all, how they define what throughput is. We can talk about that a little bit more.
00:06:22.320 - 00:06:40.670, Speaker A: And to me, it depends on where you are in the modular and the stack, basically. Are you like a data availability layer or are you an execution layer? Or maybe you're both. And we can. So I think we should talk about that in a little bit. But where Solana and Celestia, I think, differ is in the emphasis on verifiability and, like, what the. And also even maybe how they define that. Right.
00:06:40.670 - 00:07:20.912, Speaker A: And for Celestia, you know, how we define verifiability is that end users should be able to verify the chain because blockchains are about social consensus. And if an end user doesn't have a way of checking that, what the validators are doing is like, you know, actually enforcing the rules that they have agreed to, then they don't really have a vote in the system. They're sort of second class citizens. And we believe in like a, we don't want to have a tiered system here. It's a peer to peer network where every peer, every, you know, user and member of the network is on the same ground. And it's a level playing field and equal power for everyone. So that's, that's like how we, how we define it.
00:07:20.912 - 00:08:21.950, Speaker A: I don't, you know, the Solana definition seems to be more like, well, as long as there's enough full nodes, they will see what's going on and be able to tell other people, I guess, which I think is pretty flawed, because then you end up in a situation where it's like, well, how am I, if you're making that big of an accusation that, hey, this chain is broken, then everything has to stop and everyone's going to be like, holy fuck. Well, who do I trust? Oh, I trust these guys. It comes back to the same problem that blockchains are supposed to solve from the beginning to me. So I think verifiability and user verifiability is really important. So that's why Celestia does things like database sampling, why we believe in proof based blockchain systems, because proof based is something that users can verify directly. If you have to actually re execute the whole chain and download every block, then you're never going to get there. I'll stop there and then maybe we can talk about censorship resistance for sure.
00:08:22.030 - 00:09:20.948, Speaker B: So I think most of the audience is super technical, so we probably don't have to explain it to them. But I ultimately like to explain some of these more technical concepts to the average person as well. And ultimately, as Nick and I have kind of been talking about, as kind of, you increase the throughput or increase the block size, that is going to really take larger hardware requirements. You can move it, I always say, you can't obfuscate the physics. You can move that from the layer one to an eigen layer, or you can move that to an arbitrum nova. But eventually that physics of propagating data or having high throughput has to happen somewhere. When that does happen, to have a full node be able to verify that, because you're having larger resources to ingest, you need larger machines.
00:09:20.948 - 00:10:03.010, Speaker B: And so what we're ultimately talking about is the differences of, as these machines get larger and larger, because they're going to be able to process more throughput. Both Solana and Celestia full nodes will have large requirements, but today Solana doesn't have data availability sampling or diet clients. I think in Solana's case, Celestia very much prioritizes that verifiability, which is data availability sampling that allows anybody to do data availability sampling and essentially act as a full check on full nodes. And correct me if you disagree with any of that.
00:10:04.110 - 00:11:01.330, Speaker A: Yeah, this gets to the core of the issue here, too. Throughput and verifiability are very intertwined in the sense of if you want to scale throughput, I think it's pretty self evident that to scale block production, you need to have beefier validator nodes. And then if you have beefier validator nodes, the full node requirements for the chain. So anyone who wants to verify the chain via running a full node also increase. So if you want a global scale blockchain with high powered full nodes, then that necessarily starts to limit the number of people who can verify the chain themselves. That's why it's so important to have data availability sampling that allows you to verify it on a phone. No matter how big the chain gets, you're going to be able to verify it on a very, very cheap hardware.
00:11:01.330 - 00:11:44.130, Speaker A: That's why for Celestia baking and data availability sampling from the beginning was absolutely important, like key. And so that's a big conflict. Now, the thing about diet clients, for example, which I think, I'm glad to see that the Solana community was starting to move in that direction. The problem with diet client, I think I'm remembering the construction correctly, is you can, as a validator, I think, raise a flag that says, hey, this block is invalid. And if it turns out to be valid, then you can slash me, kind of thing. I think that's what it is. And then people can be running these nodes that listen for that.
00:11:44.130 - 00:12:16.032, Speaker A: And then when that happens, they can halt the chain, basically, until they are able to verify it for themselves. The problem with that is the so called fisherman's dilemma, where someone could actually withhold data in a block so that the validator can't know whether or not that block is valid. So they raise the flag, and then later they publish the data behind it. And then it's like, hey, this guy raised a flag when the block actually turned out to be valid, so you should slash him. So this is something that's been known in the research community for a long time. So I think it runs. It doesn't solve the same problem.
00:12:16.032 - 00:12:41.090, Speaker A: I think the only way to solve this is via data availability sampling. And so I know that, what is it called? Tiny dancer. There was a team doing, like, clients for Solana, and I know that they were working on some kind of solution to this, but I think it's going to take a lot of work to bake into data value sampling into Solana.
00:12:42.510 - 00:14:18.420, Speaker B: Yeah, I am curious, because ultimately, as we kind of alluded to in the beginning of this, I do very much appreciate the slesy approach of data availability sampling and the verification aspect. When I ultimately talked with Sam Blackshear, the co founder, or I believe, the creator of move and the co founder of Miss and Labs, or SWe, they're also creating what they called a sparse node that will track individual assets that user cares about. So anytime anything happens on chain, they're able to verify that themselves. But I think that celestia is definitely on the forefront of this verifiability. And I think, I don't know if other chains are going to do exact one to one data availability sampling, but some form of verification for at least some assets or the assets that I care about or select will be able to be verified. Because at the end of the day, as we spoke about, like, as throughput gets larger and larger and these machines become larger and larger in terms of hardware requirements, it is going to be a little bit more costly to run them to actually get to the throughput that we really want to scale the industry past where it is today being relatively niche. But I am very excited about ultimately that future that we can get to with kind of these high throughput chains that Celestia and Solana have really pioneered.
00:14:19.400 - 00:14:26.064, Speaker A: I'm just going to pause really quick because it seems, I don't know if you're having this, but my Internet seems to be like going on and off. It's okay.
00:14:26.112 - 00:14:36.980, Speaker B: I don't know if it's mine or you because let me, I have it just direct line to my Internet, but let me try wi fi because I'm having an issue.
00:14:37.560 - 00:14:52.058, Speaker A: It might be me. I don't know. I can run a speed test. I mean, I have, I don't know. I mean, obviously I have a shitload of speed, but, but I'll turn on.
00:14:52.074 - 00:15:10.692, Speaker B: My wi fi and see if that helps it. Yeah, you're like cutting in and out. I guess I am too. And then I can like hear you talk about some aspects and then I'm like, oh shit, it was actually talking. And then it will like cut back in the.
00:15:10.826 - 00:15:19.980, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah, I couldn't hear some of your, like, your, your, the things that you said because they're like, freeze. And then I could tell when I was talking that you were frozen and I was like, oh, fuck. Anyway.
00:15:22.840 - 00:15:58.540, Speaker B: Let'S give it a try out. Like just all these pauses or whatnot. But it was speaking primarily about switching sparse nodes. Solana doing sparse nodes or not sparse node, die client. But like on a larger level, like we spoke about. And what Vitalik really articulated is at least some form of verification is going to happen on all these high throughput blockchains as hardware requirements get larger and larger. And people want to be able to verify more of the chain or at least select assets on the chain that they really care about.
00:15:59.600 - 00:16:48.760, Speaker A: Definitely. And I think that the modular approach is very aligned with that philosophy because you don't have to verify all the roll ups necessarily. You can just verify the ones that you're using. I think splitting up the state has a lot of value, not only for being able to have more scalable execution, but also having users be able to just pay attention to the things that matter to them and not have to. Why? This is my main thing about the monolithic thing is why should I understand the value of a global atomic state machine? Don't get me wrong. And in fact, you can have that in a roll up. A roll up can get really big.
00:16:48.760 - 00:16:49.120, Speaker A: Right?
00:16:49.200 - 00:16:50.424, Speaker B: We should talk about that.
00:16:50.552 - 00:17:29.180, Speaker A: But why force everything? Or why take the stance that everything should be atomically composable when a lot of things will not want to? Certain things will be for sure, like certain defi things. Who knows? We'll see how things evolve. But why mandate that all application, all states need to be globally atomically composable? Because that just imposes a massive cost as a baseline for everything. And not everything is going to need that. So why not just give the flexibility? Modularity doesn't say that that's a bad idea. It just says, let the people, the users and the builders choose which things are atomically composable.
00:17:30.410 - 00:18:54.370, Speaker B: Yeah, let's get into the solestia narrative, because both have been doing fairly well within the markets, which anything that goes up in crypto is the new hot thing. Hopefully both of those trends continue, but more so just because of what they enabled than anything outside of number go up. But maybe quantifying some of the stuff that you mentioned and going a little bit deeper into having a single L2 as a large kind of atomic system, because I don't think people really, people are now just starting to understand L2s. They are just starting to understand data availability layers. Layer two s have been kind of more prominent for a long period of time, but with high throughput blockchains like Silesia, you can have a single atomic state machine similar to Solana. Can you talk about kind of your vision if that were to exist? I think the biggest call out in my mind would just be how many nodes run that L2 within that is settling that data to celestia.
00:18:56.070 - 00:20:04.512, Speaker A: So I want to. Yeah, let's say the groundwork for the sort of celestia meme, solestia, I really love. I don't know, I love it that it just so happened that the two names portmanteau very well together reminds me of Solun Avax, although that's a little bit cursed. So what's cool about the Celestia meme is that for the last two or three years, or kind of since the inception of celestia when we were getting started, there's been this debate between the modular architecture and the monolithic architecture. We're already, again, getting back into it inherently in this podcast without really thinking about it. And to me, Celestia is sort of like that debate is no longer just theoretical, it's no longer just because it used to be Celestia saying, theoretically, when we're live, we're going to have these benefits, so we're going to be able to do these new things. And obviously, it had to be all in theory, because Celestia was not live yet.
00:20:04.512 - 00:20:46.550, Speaker A: But now that Celestia is launched, we have mainnet, we have actual rollups being deployed. We're actually seeing the modular versus monolithic debate play out in real time and seeing how the different architectures work. And so now it's like the proof can be more in the pudding. And obviously, celestial is still quite early. It's only been live for three months. But that's what it kind of touches on for me, is like, okay, now we're each sort of like the flag bearers of the monolithic camp and the modular camp, and it's going to be fun. And honestly, by the way, this is what I love about crypto, is that all these different approaches should be tried because they all have validity.
00:20:46.550 - 00:21:19.436, Speaker A: Then it's about the users and the builders and the open market to decide which ones work. It's awesome that we can run all these experiments in parallel, because it means that ultimately we get to the end game faster. I agree. Obviously, I want Celestia. I believe that Celestia and the modular architecture is the right endgame. But what I care more about is that we do get there one day, because I do believe that blockchains are going to make the world a better place. So if that's Solana, that ends up making that happen great, and vice versa.
00:21:19.548 - 00:22:13.260, Speaker B: I think from a practical difference, I'm curious what you think if there are any large differences from, say, a Celestia being a high throughput layer, data availability layer that's focused on doing consensus and verifiability, or settlement, and Solana doing high throughput at the base layer, less emphasis on the verification, but also doing executions, consensus and settlement. Is there too much of a practical difference in your mind from having a L2 built on Celestia and settling to Celestia versus the L2 being built on Solana and settling to Solana outside of verification?
00:22:14.560 - 00:22:57.522, Speaker A: Good question. I think that Solana, yeah, aside from the fact that obviously there's no data availability sampling Solana does have a lot of data availability bandwidth. It has big blocks and a lot of credit to the engineers who have solved really hard problems to make that possible. But again, like you said, that throughput is not verifiable by end users yet. Maybe in the future it will be. But I think there's other things about the Solana architecture that don't really make it an ideal data availability layer. As I understand, it's not made for posting big blobs of data to.
00:22:57.522 - 00:23:42.370, Speaker A: It is not meant for referencing, quickly referencing that data from the L2 and sort of proving certain things about that data and where it's included and things like that. Also, maybe to back up Celestia was built from the ground up with roll ups in mind, with l two s in mind. So it's like, hey, well, if you started from scratch and you were to design a blockchain that's specifically for l two s, this is how you build it. And some of the things are, one, no execution on the base layer. You want to have as light of a base layer as possible. You have no state. You don't want to because all the l two s that use the base layer have to fully verify the l one in order to make sure that they can actually build on top of that l one.
00:23:42.370 - 00:24:44.008, Speaker A: In Ethereum, this is already a problem, even though ethereum is so much lighter than even Solana that all the l two full nodes need to fully verify the ethereum l one. That's actually pretty heavy because Ethereum has so much state and transactions, and it's like a whole, like a whole, like, here's how big your l two is. And then you have to also do all this work for Ethereum, whereas Celestia is designed to be almost no state, almost no execution. So that like, it's this very thin thing, and then your l two is the main thing, right? And you just, you just post data to Celestia and that's it. On top of that design choice are things like namespaced Merkle trees, which is Celestia. Every block in Celestia, all the blobs, the data gets organized into a way that's very easy for you as an l two to find the data that's relevant to you and ignore everything else. And that's really important so that you can actually prove things about your chain and you can quickly sort of like know the things that are relevant and track your roll up.
00:24:44.008 - 00:25:18.740, Speaker A: And then on top of that are just things like the fee market being designed specifically for that the transaction sizes being allowed to be very big so you can customize other things about your, for example, your mempool. If you know that a lot of fees are going to be these massive blobs rather than a bunch of smaller transactions, it changes all the other aspects of the design. I don't know all the details of how Solana works, but a lot of that would not really translate over because that's not what Solana was designed for.
00:25:20.080 - 00:25:39.568, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm. I am curious just to see if you put a L2 on each, just in that roadmap. I mean, theoretically, you could kind of use. I mean, granted, celestia is much more optimized for L2s and Solana, but I'm curious. There are, I know there are a couple L2 settling to Solana, and I'm. No.
00:25:39.624 - 00:25:41.556, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. I didn't know that.
00:25:41.728 - 00:26:00.596, Speaker B: Yeah, there's an exchange, actually called Cube. Well, Neil did start out with eclipse doing like, the l two, but now they've kind of pivoted a bit. But I do think there will be more. So I'm curious to see how it will work.
00:26:00.788 - 00:26:10.680, Speaker A: So what I was just describing is if you want to use Solana as a da layer, right? So I don't think it's designed to be da layer, but settlement, I'm sure, could work.
00:26:11.270 - 00:26:13.262, Speaker B: Or a da layer.
00:26:13.446 - 00:27:00.656, Speaker A: Okay. And also, even, I mean, there are things like roam protocol, which are trying to turn Solana into, like, a shared sequencer. I mean, even recently, Justin Drake was posted about Ethereum being a shared sequencer, which is super interesting. I think we're still at the very early stages of really exploring all the different ways in which existing protocols or the existing technology they've built can be sort of used in a modular way. And, like, you know, eclipse, which you just mentioned, is really interesting because it takes, like, one of the things that's really amazing about Solana is a Solana virtual machine. The parallel execution and the local fee markets and all those things. And, like, the cool thing is you can take all that innovation and then slap it in on a roll up and all of a sudden it's available.
00:27:00.656 - 00:27:32.390, Speaker A: It's not just limited to the Solana L1. It can be set free for anyone to reuse. And that's really the power of modular blockchains, too. To me, I use this analogy of monolithic blockchains are sort of top down. It's a more like, I hate communist way of doing things. It's like centralized control. It's like the core devs or whoever is in control of deciding what the spec of the chain is, they decide what features get shipped.
00:27:32.390 - 00:27:58.660, Speaker A: In the modular world, it's more bottoms up. It's about people are building all different kind of components, and anyone can try anything. No one's gating you from shipping that into production. And it's just like, well, if you think it's useful, build it and then see if people end up using it. So I think it's a lot more of an organic approach to developing the infrastructure layer of the stack.
00:28:00.640 - 00:29:12.850, Speaker B: So maybe let's go back a bit to the example that we had of building a solana on Slesia, to your point, having a open playground to experiment with virtual machines. If we took the Solana virtual machine, put it on as a L2 on top of Celestia, you would have that verifiability function, all the benefits that you mentioned with the Solana virtual machine, as like with the local fee markets, parallel execution, et cetera, et cetera. I think the interesting thing there is today, the issue that has really arose out of kind of the L2 roadmap has really been around decentralization, and just making sure that you have enough decentralization at that L2 and making sure that today, historically, that is kind of one sequencer. And if you wanted to get to similar levels of decentralization, to, say, a Solana of the world, I think they have like 2000 boxes of like that would rotate. So you'd need 2000 equivalent is like the biggest differentiator outside of just the pure data availability layers, my understanding.
00:29:13.390 - 00:29:28.162, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a very good point. The reality, and this is actually a very good critique of the modular ecosystem that exists as it exists today is this, you know, I mean, Mert is always saying, like, oh, you know, champion.
00:29:28.306 - 00:29:35.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I appreciate that he does it because I try to be online as much as him, but I pay a little comparison.
00:29:36.170 - 00:30:01.068, Speaker A: I know. Yeah, someone was joking. I saw a tweet the other day. It was like, I guess Solana went down briefly, but someone was like, oh, well, Mert and Ansemshe TPS tweets per second is like bigger than Solana's right now. They have very high tps in terms of tweet per second. Anyway, merch, great. And I really think his critique is correct, that a lot of l two s, frankly, are just trusted.
00:30:01.068 - 00:30:27.400, Speaker A: There's a lot of trust because there's like a multisig and or just a single sequencer. And that just doesn't give you very good guarantees. Now, the thing is that all of these l two s, the end game is that they all have proofs, and that would really reduce the trust assumptions, and a lot of them are already there. Arbitrum has this. Arbitrum nitro. You have a lot of ZK roll ups that are coming into production. So I think we're getting really close.
00:30:27.400 - 00:30:34.552, Speaker A: And so eventually that critique will be outdated, hopefully in the next year. That's what I hope.
00:30:34.616 - 00:30:53.620, Speaker B: But anyway, maybe this is a good segue to censorship resistance, because you can create that proof, but once that proof is submitted to the layer one, then it's finalized. But if there's only one sequencer that could still be technically censoring your transaction. So how do you balance that?
00:30:53.920 - 00:32:01.348, Speaker A: Yeah, so this gets into another aspect of the modular stack to me, which is if you have a single sequencer roll up, or in general these roll ups, you want to still preserve good liveness guarantees and good censorship resistance. There's a lot of different approaches to this. One is you have an inbox, and that enables you to, as a user, always withdraw to the l one in a worst case, or exit somewhere if the sequencer censors you or goes down or something like that. That's a really important one. But one of the things that is the most promising solution, obviously, you could decentralize your sequencer set and you can have a bunch of them so that it's more censorship resistant and there's more liveness, but that becomes a lot more like launching your own chain every time. That's why there's this new wave of projects that are building shared sequencers, which are sort of like a sequencer network that gives you censorship resistance and liveness. Good liveness properties out of the box without you having to launch your own chain.
00:32:01.348 - 00:33:08.422, Speaker A: Or very similar to this is the idea of based roll ups, where basically you use the underlying l one as your sequencer layer, and then you just inherit the censorship resistance and liveness guarantees of the underlying l one in general. Again, actually, like we were talking about in the beginning, one of the key properties of the endgame is censorship resistance. And this is something that is hard because, and it connects to another reason why there's going to be centralized block production is because of mev. It's very likely that block production will continue to centralize. Even if you have like 2000 validator nodes or whatever. There's going to be a lot of reasons why block production. They might be off chain builders, or it might be that like all those validators end up collaborating occluding in some way to extract more mev for themselves, things like that, specifically in the data availability layer context for celestia, even though most of the execution is off chain.
00:33:08.422 - 00:33:34.670, Speaker A: So you'd think that a lot of the Mev is off chain. The problem is that there's this thing called profitable censorship, where the validators could choose to censor your roll up and mess with you as a way to get more mev for themselves. That is the motivation for why we need to have really good sensors resistance, because even just having a bunch of different distributed validators, that might not be enough in the long run.
00:33:35.650 - 00:33:40.550, Speaker B: Is that expanding even outside of the Nakamoto coefficient?
00:33:42.130 - 00:34:29.441, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting how it all plays out. There are new proposals for consensus protocols that bake in more censorship resistance into the protocol natively. There's something called. What is it called? I can't remember, but someone was just telling me about a consensus protocol designed for this. There's this idea of multiplicity that came from this guy in the cosmos ecosystem, and it's basically about ending the proposer monopoly, because if you think about it, every block proposer, every validator has a monopoly over that block. Right? And so you want to try to, like, break that monopoly and make it so that. Yeah, like, you get.
00:34:29.441 - 00:34:45.850, Speaker A: Just get much better censorship resistance guarantees. And so I think that's going to be. That's not really that important yet, but, I mean, it is very important, but it's just like, I think that's a. That that becomes really relevant later on, like, maybe in a few years or something, but we should start working on it now.
00:34:46.010 - 00:35:15.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Solana and some of the newer execution environments, they have dags, and so they have multiple leaders that make the essentially monopoly instead of one leader always controlling Mev. You can pick different nodes or hopefully the closest geographical leader to you so that you have lower latency, but you ultimately have a little bit more competition, so to speak, for block production.
00:35:16.900 - 00:35:19.684, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds really interesting. I'd love to read more about that.
00:35:19.852 - 00:36:02.740, Speaker B: It is all interesting. I'm very curious to see where it all ends up, but we've been going a little bit nerdy for a little bit. So let me try to bring it back up and talk about where you see the industry ultimately kind of going from an end state. We've been talking about the different trade offs, predominantly from the more modular versus integrated chains. But believe me, and correct me if I'm wrong, you very much see this world of this proof aggregation in game and I think Polygon really recently announced something similar where they're doing aggregations of proof. Could you maybe expand upon that vision a little bit more and how you see that world ultimately ending up?
00:36:03.040 - 00:36:56.440, Speaker A: Absolutely. So one of the main complaints that the monolithic people levy against the modular architecture is this idea of fragmentation of state. And all these roll ups are going to be these little islands of state, and interoperability and bridging is still very janky and trusted and slow. And so you're really compromising on one of the other value props, blockchains, which is like, state should be interoperable. And I completely agree with that. And so that is something that I think Solana in the near term has an advantage over everything being interoperable and atomically composable. But what's really amazing is that in the modular stack, we have a solution, and that is proof aggregation.
00:36:56.440 - 00:37:54.338, Speaker A: And the thing is, that solution is going to be, is really hard to execute. But Polygon, I was really surprised when they announced that they're already working on, they have an mvp of it, that they're going to launch supposedly this month. Essentially what proof aggregation is, is the idea that you can take a bunch of state proofs of a bunch of different roll ups and then fold them all into one root proof that each one of the roll ups then can verify. And what's beautiful about this is like, okay, let's say you did have roll ups and they were able to bridge with each other. First of all, you want to make it trust minimize. So they're not just like, you know, it's not just multisig, you want to actually verify each other state. But then when you, even when you do that, you have to worry about what is the topology of this bridging? And is it going to be a hub and spoke, or is it going to be like a nested tree of bridging? And then you have to have all these different paths.
00:37:54.338 - 00:38:46.932, Speaker A: And so that you fragment the actual which assets are canonical and which chains, and you have to do all this hopping and it gets really ugly. And there's a lot of overhead because every bridge, in order to verify the other chain has to do a certain amount of work and posting block headers. And it becomes really bad really fast. Again, a lot of monolithic people, including a Kyle, rightfully critiqued that vision. And the cool thing is that proof aggregation can solve all those problems, because it's an all to all bridge between all those rollups that participate in that aggregation. Essentially, where verifying one single proof, I can now verify the state updates of all those other rollups with just one proof. And I don't have to do more work for each new roll up that wants to join in and bridge to me.
00:38:46.932 - 00:39:28.816, Speaker A: And I don't have to worry about the routing and all the complexities because it's just each bridge is literally direct one to one. So it's a beautiful vision for how we can unify the state and unfragment, solve the fragmentation essentially. That's inherent in a roll up centric world. And by the way, also, I want to just give a shout out that Vitalik is sort of the person who first, I mean, I had talked to teams like sovereign SDK, sovereign labs about this kind of idea, but Vitalik really articulated it extremely well at modular summit last year, and it was like, it was really a badass speech. So if people are interested, they should watch that.
00:39:28.848 - 00:39:49.830, Speaker B: I did watch that talk. It was very interesting. Proofs on proofs on proofs in aggregation world. Where does this aggregation actually happen? Is it going to happen at kind of the celestia on the layer one? Would that happen at kind of the decentralized sequencer level? Like where in the stack does that actually live?
00:39:50.450 - 00:40:41.986, Speaker A: Really good question. So I tweeted something about basically to the effect of proof aggregation is the end game for the settlement layer. And the reason I said that is settlement. What it really is about to me is about bridging and unifying liquidity, allowing state to interoperate with each other in the old world, or even the way that things work today is ethereum, for example, is a settlement layer. You have all this liquidity there. All the roll ups roll up into that, and then they can bridge between each other in theory, but with proof aggregation, it's no longer that you need a specific settlement layer. It doesn't need to be a chain.
00:40:41.986 - 00:41:22.586, Speaker A: The settlement is just the fact it's more sovereign, essentially, because each roll up is able to do its own settlement by just verifying that one proof. The settlement is the proof, if that makes sense. It almost doesn't. You don't even really have a settlement layer in that case, which is kind of interesting because each roll up is doing the settlement by just verifying the proof. And this really aligns with Celestia's long term vision. And it's also kind of why in some ways, I've never felt totally confident saying that settlement is a layer. It is a component, it's an important part of the stack.
00:41:22.586 - 00:41:30.480, Speaker A: But it's not like it doesn't have to be a layer. It doesn't to be its own chain, because settlement can be sovereign in a sense, and, like, handled by the chains themselves.
00:41:31.740 - 00:41:39.760, Speaker B: So forgive me. I'm still a little confused. Okay, so forgive the questions if they're dumb.
00:41:40.060 - 00:41:46.200, Speaker A: No, they're definitely not. I'm probably just, like, rambling and sound like I with the whiteboard, you know, who's like.
00:41:47.660 - 00:42:02.034, Speaker B: So, for example, say there's ten roll ups built on Celestia. The first roll up creates this proof. How does that proof ultimately get shared? With roll up number two and roll up number three?
00:42:02.202 - 00:42:32.226, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. This is where I wish I had a whiteboard. I mean, I have a whiteboard here, but I don't want to mess up my setup anyway, so. Okay, think about it this way. By the way, I didn't mention that a prerequisite to this working is that in order for these roll ups to be part of this proof aggregation layer, they have to be ZK rollups. So each of these Zkrollups generates a proof saying, hey, this is the new state of this chain, and I can prove that this is valid.
00:42:32.226 - 00:42:47.990, Speaker A: And it might even have a reference to. I can also prove to you that the data behind this is in a celestial block. For example, in this celestia block. And if you sample that block, then you can trust it. So they have that proof. Let's say you have ten of these ZK robes. They each generate that proof.
00:42:47.990 - 00:43:29.430, Speaker A: So you have ten of these proofs. Now you have a recursion step where you take two of these proofs and you prove that they're both valid. So now you have a proof that proves both of these proofs, and then you just recurse up until you're left with just one proof that proves all of them at once. And now you take that one proof, and on this single ZK rollup, it verifies that proof, and then within that, it can know this is a state. On all these other ten rollups, this guy just did a cross chain action that I need to update my chain for, and vice versa, if that makes sense.
00:43:30.690 - 00:44:01.490, Speaker B: An example is, again, going back to Celestia. Ten l two rollups roll up one and two each create their own proof, and then they essentially communicate together within that and create a kind of higher proof, aggregating those roll up nine and ten each create their individual proofs and then create a shared proof, same for the other roll ups within this. And then ultimately, at the end, you have one roll up that would get submitted to the layer one.
00:44:03.430 - 00:44:11.248, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it doesn't have to be submitted to layer one. Each roll up can verify that single proof. Does that make sense? Then?
00:44:11.264 - 00:44:28.220, Speaker B: That would just be once you get all the L2s proofs aggregated, then you would redistribute that to all the different l two s to verify that this one proof is holistic of all the proofs aggregated.
00:44:28.520 - 00:45:38.072, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So that roll up by verifying that proof is essentially verifying, has a trust minimized bridge with every other roll up whose proof was included in that master proof, if that makes sense. Just to touch on the settlement part and celestia specifically. Interestingly, although unrelated, Celestia is exploring the idea of adding what we call ZK accounts, which are special accounts in celestia, that instead of being able to move or spend the funds or do certain things by verifying a signature, instead, it depends on the verification of a ZK program. And so if you present a valid proof rather than a signature, then to this account, that will enable you to do certain things. The reason that this is so powerful is in some ways, it allows for settlement on the celestia base chain, kind of. But really, the use is that you can now move, like Tia tokens from Celestia up into the rollups in a trust minimized way.
00:45:38.072 - 00:45:52.460, Speaker A: Whereas right now, in order to bridge Tia to rollups, you need to actually go through IBC or some other not direct, not fully trust minimized way of doing things.
00:45:53.450 - 00:45:54.346, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:45:54.498 - 00:46:15.698, Speaker A: But the goal is not for Celestia to be a settlement layer, by the way, it's not like we're settlement pluralists. It's the same thing, like build whatever it's like. And I think that's actually something that makes Celestia so powerful. We can let Ethereum be the settlement layer. Ethel two is built on Ethereum. We supply the DA. That's what we care about supplying the DA.
00:46:15.698 - 00:46:40.616, Speaker A: We can even allow bitcoin to be a settlement layer. I was just thinking about today about the BitVM stuff, and how with BitVM now, we could verify our blobstream x off chain DA system on bitcoin. All of a sudden, you can have bitcoin be this settlement layer for bitcoin l two s. And I think that plurality is really the kind of what we believe in. So I want to make that clear for sure.
00:46:40.808 - 00:47:48.090, Speaker B: I think maybe the other kind of big differentiation between, say, Celestia and Solana, or some of the more other integrated blockchains is the idea around kind of having a single execution environment really dominating the vast majority of activity, instead of having hundreds, thousands, or millions of different L2s. And I think ultimately that probably boils down to, well, it used to be local fee markets, just making sure that you can have multiple applications, live in with kind of one shard, and kind of dynamically allocate those resources and the pricing within them. But I think even outside of that, the larger point of the Celestia community, again, correct me if I'm wrong, is more that, hey, you should be able to build whatever you want, and that flexibility is ultimately what will really be the prolification of thousands, if not millions of different L2s, because engineers are going to want more of that customization or flexibility.
00:47:49.030 - 00:48:31.324, Speaker A: Yeah. So this touches on back to Solana. Celestia differences is we really firmly believe in there's no one size fits all. And I think Solana's like, hey, this SVM is enough. Like, you don't need more, just use this out of the box. And Celestia is more like, it's about build whatever. It's that the best applications are going to come from people who want to go in and choose each of the different components to reach a spot on the tradeoff curve that is uniquely suited for that thing.
00:48:31.324 - 00:49:40.318, Speaker A: Whereas if you build on a monolithic architecture, you're kind of stuck for the most part on that one tradeoff point that's been chosen for you. So I think customizability is inherently just essential to building compelling apps in web3. And so there's certain things like being able to customize your execution environment, your vm, to, let's say, add certain account abstraction features or some kind of different fee rules. Or for example, there's this change in the EVM that allows you to natively use the secure enclaves and phones as your wallet. That allows way better user onboarding. There's a lot of cool things like that that you can only do in a modular architecture, the modular approach and that customizability that that brings. Another thing that's really important is just like monetization.
00:49:40.318 - 00:50:29.890, Speaker A: So if I'm building an app on a shared execution layer, all the execution fees are going to that l one or whatever execution layer that is. It could be. It doesn't have to be Solana. It could be even arbitram one or the optimism mainnet chain. And there's a lot of incentives for those apps, if they become successful, to migrate to their own chain where they can internalize those execution fees rather than just dumping them into whatever execution layer you can actually make as a developer, a significant amount of money if your application has traction because you're able to capture some of the economic value that you're generating. I think that those are some pretty big reasons why the modular approach is so compelling to builders.
00:50:30.670 - 00:51:13.410, Speaker B: I think going back to our earlier point, a lot of this I do think will ultimately converge. What I'm seeing more in the integrated stack is more customization or more flexibility, whether to capture mev for different applications in the application smart contract level, or even some things that ultimately got shipped with Solana in terms of token extensions, trying to make the general purpose chain more customizable over time. While Celestia is saying, hey, you can do whatever you want right now, immediately today with your own L2, there's a billion permutations. Go for it.
00:51:14.300 - 00:51:21.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually haven't had the time to go deep into the, what was it called? The token.
00:51:21.900 - 00:51:23.012, Speaker B: Token extensions.
00:51:23.116 - 00:51:23.724, Speaker A: Token extensions.
00:51:23.772 - 00:51:29.772, Speaker B: Token 22 as engineers are great at naming things, but I think by marketing.
00:51:29.876 - 00:52:25.340, Speaker A: To token extensions, I think marketing made a good call there. But I read the tweet thread and I watched a bit of the video, but I haven't been able to go deep on it. But I was pretty impressed and it sounds really cool. And I think it's awesome that they're enabling more customization at the base layer. But my take on this is that you're always going to be more limited in terms of customizability when you're building on a monolithic stack. That's just, I think, inherent to the system. But maybe, maybe the amount of customization that you need only goes so far, and you're able to get 98% of the way there just with token extensions, for example, in which case maybe the trade off is fine.
00:52:25.340 - 00:53:08.134, Speaker A: I think we'll see how both of them play out. But there's also things even, for example, in the modular stack, I can choose a different shared sequencer technology that allows me to customize things around like okay, have a private mempool, I can have really, really fast soft confirmations and all these things that like, again, token extensions give you this amount of customizability on this layer of the stack, whereas the modular stack gives you customizability over the full range. And so I think, but again, maybe there's going to be things, I don't know. Solana continues to surprise me, so there could be things that I'm not aware of.
00:53:08.302 - 00:54:25.960, Speaker B: I'm convinced, Nick, we agree on a lot of things, ultimately just coming at it from different angles. But I do think as we've talked about a lot throughout this podcast, I feel like they're going to converge, just ultimately approaching the engineering from different ends of the spectrum. And as we both agree, each of these different sides should be applauded and should be explored, because ultimately, what we're both trying to do and the different approaches to scaling blockchains is bringing more users on chain to actually hit the level of skill that we want. Maybe in the last couple minutes, though, of the podcast, I. I really do think you've made. Not you specifically, but the Celestia team as a whole has really made tremendous progress since our last podcast. Is there any kind of, like, insights that you could give to engineers or builders? Just kind of the grind, whether that's kind of going throughout the fundraising process, surviving the ups and downs of bull markets and bear markets, or just shipping and kind of iterating.
00:54:28.620 - 00:54:33.100, Speaker A: Uh oh. I'm frozen. Okay, I think I'm back.
00:54:33.220 - 00:54:34.684, Speaker B: Did you catch the last part?
00:54:34.812 - 00:54:37.600, Speaker A: I didn't catch the full last part. Why don't you say that again? Sorry.
00:54:38.180 - 00:55:16.760, Speaker B: So, ultimately, just kind of moving forward in terms of, like, the conversation. And as we're wrapping up, I think you and the Celestia team have made tremendous progress, like, since we last spoke in New York. Can you share more of just, like, any general advice that you would give to founders builders, like, through the bull markets, through the bear markets, through either fundraising? A lot of people look to Celestia today as really a pioneer of what's possible and would love to kind of get your insights and whether that's managing teams, engineering, kind of the whole gamut.
00:55:17.620 - 00:56:03.560, Speaker A: Well, I have to say I can take almost no credit for the progress of Celestia. I'm just one person on a very talented, diverse team, and I'm also not even. I'm an engineer by training, but I don't do any engineering. So all the amazing tech that this team has built, I had no part of that. I'm just a humble. I don't know, I guess, coo anyway. But my advice, and thank you also, by the way, because it has been a lot of work, and Celestia has been a project that started actually in 2019 when Lazy Ledger Whitepaper was published by co founder Mustafa.
00:56:03.560 - 00:56:34.256, Speaker A: And it was a grind. I mean, in the beginning, he couldn't fundraise. It took months, I think, and more than 50 no's, basically, before anyone even wrote the first check into what was then lazy Ledgere. The person who wrote the first check was a dude in his dorm room. Because no one. I mean, back then, a no one knew what data availability was. B roll ups weren't even really a thing yet.
00:56:34.256 - 00:56:50.874, Speaker A: So this whole idea of a data availability layer just made no sense to people. And also that was kind of peak eth maximalism. Not in a sense, not in a toxic way, but people were just like, well, ethereum is the execution layer. That's already one.
00:56:50.922 - 00:56:55.830, Speaker B: If you talked about any execution environment outside of EVM, you're almost crucified.
00:56:59.250 - 00:57:00.950, Speaker A: Shit, I froze again.
00:57:03.210 - 00:57:12.670, Speaker B: I was saying, I remember that time, because if you talked about any other l one or even any other execution environments, you're almost crucified.
00:57:13.350 - 00:58:06.048, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I'm sure the Solana community can very much relate to this. Any alt l one, which is still kind of a dirty word or whatever, that was the peak dirtiness of that word, of why does it even matter? Who needs that? Because again, it was a bear market, there wasn't very much transactions, and Ethereum was fine anyway. I felt like Ethereum was invincible. And so it's like, why would anyone fund this weird data availability thing? So anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's been a long, long journey. So you have to really believe in what you're doing and be committed and be able to withstand the depths of negativity and pessimism and cynicism when you're going through these bear cycles, because it's very easy to fall into that, especially when there's things that genuinely make you question the space. Like things like what happened with FTX last year.
00:58:06.048 - 00:58:49.568, Speaker A: A lot of people genuinely just left because they felt that that was a sign that this is all kind of a sham. Whereas I believe that the whole FTs thing was actually just a symbol of why we need to build these systems, why verifiability is so important. If end users could have at any time verified what was happening on FTX, then that never would have happened. As soon as the first fund was moved and used for the wrong purpose, it would be like, everyone would be aware, right? So I guess. I guess having what I'm trying to say is like, Celestia was a really long project. It was a long time to get here. So it's not, there's no, like, such thing as overnight success, and it is a grind.
00:58:49.568 - 00:59:44.092, Speaker A: And I just remember also when I got into the space in 2017, feeling like, wow, I'm so late, you know, it was like, everything's already done. Everything's done super late. Yeah. And it's like, wow, I don't know, is it even worth it? Like, it seems like it's already done. And now, like, I still feel that in 2024, we're still extremely early. So if there's people out there who are thinking about getting into this space, I think we're in a really, really exciting time, because there's like the, I feel like the infrastructure layer is finally reaching a level of maturity where interesting applications are going to be possible and they're not going to end up falling flat when they get any kind of traction. Because if you think the history of crypto is every time there's an application that gets this cool excitement and product market fit, one of a few different things happen where just scale fails, essentially.
00:59:44.092 - 01:00:51.860, Speaker A: And now I think we're getting past that. I'm really excited about what the future holds for the space, and it's a really, really ripe time now. You don't have to necessarily be some gigachad protocol dev guy to do something interesting. You can build compelling user facing applications on the stuff. I love that emphasis that Solana has on, hey, users first make applications, consumer grade applications. I think that the whole space can really take a bit of that, internalize a bit of that, because sometimes we're just too. It's like a, what is it called? It's like an all you can eat, like, nerd buffet of like, oh, well, let's just like, nerd out about, like, the details of, like, how to define l two s or, you know, I don't know, what's the best optimistic roll ups better than ZK roll ups or, you know, oh, well, I don't know, all those, like, the various, like, technical debates that, you know, while valid, like, sometimes we just get a little bit, like, we just bike shed a little too much at times.
01:00:52.560 - 01:01:23.630, Speaker B: I agree. I totally agree with you. I think in terms of where new focus is going to go now that we have high throughput blockchains, you shouldn't hit that scale fail. You shouldn't have these anti network effects where applications do become large and then the network suffers. So I'm extremely excited. I'm excited for what Celestia is doing. I've always said I think Celestia is the pioneer in verification.
01:01:23.630 - 01:02:21.550, Speaker B: And I think that, to your point, FTX wouldn't have happened if people could verify. And so that aspect, I think, is only going to be more and more pertinent, I think, to highlight our entire conversations, taking these different approaches towards high throughput blockchains. I'm very interested to see where the endgame is and kind of having the convergence of all these ecosystems, but it's an exciting road. And really appreciate you, Nick, coming on, being a champion, not only for Celestia, but for helping the industry scale. I think to your point, again, this technology is extremely powerful, and we should really try to get it as in many people's hands as possible, which I'm excited about now. That is now a possibility where before it didn't look so bright.
01:02:22.010 - 01:02:55.930, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. We still have a lot of work to do, but it feels possible, and it feels like we're on the cusp of getting there. And again, thank you for having me on. Big respect to the work that you're doing and to all the, like, the whole Solana community and monolithic versus modular is all just like, it's all. It's a small debate within, like, this bubble that we're in, and really, we should be focusing externally on growing the pie and bringing more users so that we are very aligned.
01:02:56.390 - 01:03:01.990, Speaker B: Cool. Well, thank you again for coming on the podcast, Nick. It was a lot of fun and great conversation. Likewise.
