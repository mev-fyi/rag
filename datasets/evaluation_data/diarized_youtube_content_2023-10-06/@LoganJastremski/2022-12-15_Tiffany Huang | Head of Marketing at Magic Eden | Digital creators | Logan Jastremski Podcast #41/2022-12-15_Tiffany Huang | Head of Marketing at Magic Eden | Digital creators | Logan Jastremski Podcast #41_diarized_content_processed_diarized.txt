00:00:00.240 - 00:00:03.070, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much, Tiff. Really excited to do this.
00:00:03.150 - 00:00:04.210, Speaker B: Yeah, me too.
00:00:05.310 - 00:00:39.056, Speaker A: I think I've been personally, as we were talking before, having a lot more fun with in person podcasts. So I really appreciate you making the time to do this in person, but I think ultimately, you have a fascinating story. I think the story of magic Eden is fascinating. And maybe before we jump into all the awesome things that magic Eden has been doing, starting with a little bit more of your background and how you got here today and how you got into crypto.
00:00:39.128 - 00:00:41.800, Speaker B: Wait, before I dive into me, we should talk about how we met.
00:00:41.880 - 00:00:43.192, Speaker A: Yes. Yes, this is true.
00:00:43.256 - 00:00:44.312, Speaker B: This is actually a great story.
00:00:44.376 - 00:00:49.536, Speaker A: This is really funny. It was in the New York hacker house.
00:00:49.608 - 00:01:02.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So we were doing. We were at the New York Hacker House in January, and we were throwing an event at Loom Studios, which is actually the place where we did our first event back November of 2021. And then you were there.
00:01:02.902 - 00:01:03.350, Speaker A: I was there.
00:01:03.390 - 00:01:03.902, Speaker B: And then.
00:01:04.006 - 00:01:27.882, Speaker A: But before that, I came up to you guys. I think you're presenting on the stage at the hacker house. And this was when I was just starting my podcast. I came up to you guys, and I was like, please come on my podcast. And you're like, eh, I don't know who is this guy? But come to our party. I was like, okay. And, yeah, thank you for the party invite.
00:01:27.882 - 00:01:44.330, Speaker A: Ultimately, I met you guys there, and then you guys were doing a podcast with Raj, and you're like, hey, can I borrow the stuff? I was like, yeah, of course. And then Jack came on the podcast. But, no, it was funny. That was at the very beginning of this podcast journey.
00:01:44.410 - 00:02:01.240, Speaker B: Yeah, it was kind of crazy, because I think it was at that event you were actually talking about how. Yeah. So there were two things. One was that. Yes. Like, three days later. Two days later, we did film a podcast with Raj, and I realized when we were talking that we had actually no way of getting the equipment.
00:02:01.240 - 00:02:22.146, Speaker B: And I was like, oh, this dude does a podcast. Like, hey, maybe he can give us his equipment for the day. Which you did. You delivered, and it was amazing. But then you also, on that evening, you shared about how you had actually known about Magic Eden for a really long time, and you had suggested it as an investment opportunity to like someone, and they faded you on it.
00:02:22.338 - 00:02:56.890, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, ultimately, it was an interesting conversation. I even backing up prior to this, I was at Tesla, and then I took some time off just to research blockchains. And then I was talking with a couple of different people before starting frictionless about potentially joining other companies, and ultimately they were looking at different marketplaces. And I was like, Solana is popping off. Like, Solana is really cool, because ultimately it will scale. I was like, this marketplace came out of nowhere, and they're doing really well.
00:02:56.890 - 00:03:19.710, Speaker A: I essentially put together a bunch of metrics and presented to them. And ultimately, they did invest in you guys. But, yeah, it was interesting because I put together this stack, essentially, and showed them why I thought Magic Eden was doing so well. Your page visits, like, the time spent on page, like, I was pulling, like, random websites to, like, pull all this.
00:03:19.750 - 00:03:22.198, Speaker B: But, yeah, so they did. They did invest.
00:03:22.374 - 00:03:29.102, Speaker A: They ended up. They did invest. I think ultimately they were a little skeptical of Solana.
00:03:29.246 - 00:03:30.050, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:30.590 - 00:03:37.062, Speaker A: And, yeah, but now they did end up investing. But it was funny.
00:03:37.246 - 00:03:45.366, Speaker B: It was very prophetic that you like. Yeah, it kind of surfaced us when we were relatively unknown, so I always thought that was really cool.
00:03:45.438 - 00:04:06.726, Speaker A: Yeah, our stories were. Yeah, it is funny. No, it's. Yeah. Magic Eden. I think I have just been super impressed with everything magic Eden has done. I mean, even just starting from, like, pulling those initial reports to just how fast the team executes.
00:04:06.726 - 00:04:21.628, Speaker A: Like, you guys are relentless, and I love that. And so, yeah, it's a funny story, but, no, you caught me at the beginning of my podcast journey, and I really appreciate it now, like, sitting down, coming full circle and doing this today.
00:04:21.804 - 00:04:22.748, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:04:22.884 - 00:04:29.460, Speaker A: But, yeah, I would love, like, I really do think the entire story is fascinating. And so maybe starting from the beginning.
00:04:29.500 - 00:04:32.836, Speaker B: Like, you're on my coming of age starting.
00:04:32.868 - 00:04:34.948, Speaker A: Yes. How'd you get here?
00:04:35.084 - 00:05:00.786, Speaker B: I was born in Boston. No, I'm kidding. I. Yeah, I've been at Magic Eden since basically day one. I think the company started on September 17, and for the entire first year, I was religious about celebrating our birthday. So the date is, like, seared in my mind, and I joined around early October. So, basically, the genesis of magic Eden, and I'll talk about me in a little bit.
00:05:00.786 - 00:05:41.990, Speaker B: Was that the original? It was like Jack had this idea that, hey, Solana would benefit from a better marketplace. And then he was childhood friends with this guy named Sydney, who's our CTO. They had originally met when they were, like, 15 or something like that, or maybe even younger. They were on their way to math tutoring in Australia. Doctor, he is the name of the math tutor. So they always kept in touch, and they were actually both in school to become attorneys at one point, and neither of them is an attorney now, but they always kept in touch. And so, like, when Jack had this idea, he hit up Sid.
00:05:41.990 - 00:06:15.358, Speaker B: And then Sid brought in Rex, whose real name is Zhou Jie. And Zhou Jie was a past colleague of Sid. So they worked together both at Uber and at Facebook, now meta. And then I think Jack also met our COO Joshin at, like, a bluestone coffee in San Francisco. Like, I know this story so intimately. Basically, the four of these people were like, all right, let's do this thing. And in the beginning we were all working part time.
00:06:15.358 - 00:06:50.550, Speaker B: So we have four co founders, Jack, Joshin, Sid and Rex. And they were all working full time on their other jobs. And then it wasn't until Lisbon, say, like November. So around two months after that, we all decided to quit. And by that time I was there, maybe we had basically around eight to 15 people max by that point. But then it wasn't until we were actually. It was actually crazy because magic Eden, before the bear one came, we were actually profitable from a very, very early stage.
00:06:50.550 - 00:07:02.562, Speaker B: And then we decided to kind of go all in. So in the beginning we were all anonymous. So, like, Jack was like Leo and Jocelyn was Zed and Sid was something.
00:07:02.626 - 00:07:03.834, Speaker A: That was the trend at the time.
00:07:03.922 - 00:07:21.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And I was Theo Fauna. Yeah. And then I think the first person we hired was Igor, whose name is. Most people actually know him by Charfordmonkey. We found him off discord and he was actually kind of my first boss. He was running marketing first, and then it became me.
00:07:21.902 - 00:07:22.486, Speaker A: Nice.
00:07:22.638 - 00:08:09.676, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's kind of like the OG story and I guess kind of going to me. Yeah, I stumbled upon magic Eden pretty spontaneously. Really. I was working in hospitality. So my career spans I like, in retrospect, none of it makes any sense, but I went from management consulting to UX design and then I went into hospitality for like, six years and then I landed up in magic Eden. So I always joked that I went from like, web zero to web3, but, yeah, I was actually planning on taking a year off and, like, didn't actually want to work and wanted to make it as like, a freelance writer. And then, yeah, three days after I resigned from my job, I got roped in by Katie, who's actually.
00:08:09.676 - 00:08:26.754, Speaker B: Yeah, she's a, like, leading product marketing right now for the creator side as well as overseeing launchpad marketing. But she basically wrote me in and then, yeah, I went from thinking I wasn't going to work for a year to working harder than I've ever worked before.
00:08:26.842 - 00:08:29.910, Speaker A: I was about to say you did a complete 180 on that.
00:08:31.170 - 00:08:32.790, Speaker B: Yeah. Pretty crazy.
00:08:33.410 - 00:08:44.982, Speaker A: Interesting. No, it's. I think, I mean, you and I have the kind of Hospitality in common. My first job outside of university was working in product at Expedia Group.
00:08:45.086 - 00:08:48.598, Speaker B: Oh, no Way. What product did you manage?
00:08:48.694 - 00:08:52.014, Speaker A: So I worked on Hotwire, where ultimately.
00:08:52.102 - 00:08:57.918, Speaker B: H o T w I R, hot wire does Too Funny seared into the Back of my mind.
00:08:58.094 - 00:09:20.580, Speaker A: It's skeTchy. It worked. But yeah, I worked on HOTWire and then I did that for a year before joining TEsLA. But that's super funny. What ultimately were you just tired of kind of the Travel Industry and wanted to pursue writing full time, to be honest.
00:09:21.120 - 00:09:48.156, Speaker B: So I worked at Marriott for like almost maybe over six years. And the whole story of how I even got to hospitality was super weird too. So I was working in UX design. I was at a small shop in Chicago called Gravity Tank, and they were eventually bought by Salesforce into their innovation arm. And I really wanted to work in Asia because I grew up in Taipei. So I'm taiwanese. And I think a lot of asian Americans feel this existential crisis at some point.
00:09:48.156 - 00:10:22.120, Speaker B: They're like, who am I? Like, am I asian or am I american? What's my identity? And for me, because I grew up in Taipei, I had this really deep desire to work in Asia and I didn't care what I did. And so I read about Marriotthood International CMO. Her name is Peggy Fang Roh. So read about her. And then I was like, oh, I would love to work for her. So I just slid in her DM's on LinkedIn, which is how I got my job at gravity tank too. Just sliding in DM's all day long.
00:10:22.120 - 00:10:57.526, Speaker B: And so she actually responded. And so then, if you remember, Marriott bought Starwood in 2016, and all of a sudden they needed an extra pair of hands in Asia Pacific. And so we started talking and she was the CMO in Asia Pacific. She referred me to the COO, and I basically worked for our chief operations services officer for like three and a half years. And it was really cool. So the job was based in Hong Kong. So I lived in Hong Kong and then traveled to like a bunch of different hotels.
00:10:57.526 - 00:10:59.478, Speaker B: I think I've walked probably over 100 hotels.
00:10:59.574 - 00:10:59.926, Speaker A: Really?
00:10:59.998 - 00:11:29.202, Speaker B: Yeah. Pretty cool. And then I ended my time. I was working in operations and then I went to brand because I wanted to do something more creative. Ended my time leading marketing for the non luxury portfolio. And then for personal reasons, I was actually trying to date, I had a long distance relationship with someone and I was trying to date him. And so I moved to the states, and it was during the pandemic, so I was like, all right, I'll find Marriott.
00:11:29.202 - 00:12:04.770, Speaker B: Maybe they'll give me a transfer. And so I took a transfer offer to work remotely on the west coast in the customer experience design team. I wish I didn't really understand what that meant, but I was like, oh, I don't know, came from UX design. I'll figure it out. And long story short, I just felt super disconnected. And I'd spent the last half a decade feeling super tangible. And the results that I drove are really, I could see it, right? Hospitality is one of those things where the gratification is nearly instant because you are so connected to the end user.
00:12:04.770 - 00:12:32.260, Speaker B: So I was running all these big brand campaigns and activations and I was like, oh, this is awesome. And then all of a sudden I was working remotely and I think they put me on a project about translating websites and I just couldn't fucking handle it. So I ended up quitting. And at the time, a side passion of mine has always been writing. I've really enjoyed writing. And I actually spent most of 2021 trying to work through a 40 page manuscript. Yeah.
00:12:32.260 - 00:13:01.588, Speaker B: So actually there's so much context. So, like in. So if people remember in March of 2021, I think there was a lot of anti asian sentiment that was happening in the US. And I was feeling very alone and I was living in Asia. I really missed being in Hong Kong. So I started actually interviewing my mom and asking her stories about how she grew up. Cause I wanted to feel a little more rooted while being in the states.
00:13:01.588 - 00:13:35.666, Speaker B: And then the stories were really fascinating. My mom is a survivor of the cultural revolution and all this crazy shit in China. It's actually pretty wild. And then I was like, oh, I should try to publish these stories or whatever. So I ended up getting into writing programs across publishers in Portland and multidisciplinary asian american arts organizations in New York and San Francisco. So I pounded out all these different writing programs and I was like, oh, feeling so bullish, I'm gonna quit my job and just write. And I even lined up a couple different contracts deals for myself to keep myself alive.
00:13:35.666 - 00:14:00.986, Speaker B: Like, I calculated, I was like, if I just make $4,000 a month, I'll be fine. And so I got the courage after over half a decade to quit my job at Marriott. And then three days later, Katie called and was like, oh, actually I called her. Cause I was in San Francisco at the time and I was like, hey, I just finally quit my job. Take me out for a drink. And she was like, I'm actually in Colorado, but we're building this little thing called magic Eden.
00:14:01.058 - 00:14:01.818, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:14:01.914 - 00:14:37.526, Speaker B: And then it was. And then I was curious. So my frame of mind was like, I really want to write, but the life of a writer is really miserable because you make thirty cents a word, and the grind is really hard. You try to get an MFA, and who knows if you'll ever make the money back after what you paid for it. There's so many institutions that are surrounding how writers are brought to life. I was like, maybe if I do nfts, I can find a way of monetizing my writing. And I was like, yeah, maybe I'll just write some blog posts for you guys.
00:14:37.526 - 00:14:56.530, Speaker B: So the original job offer was to write blog posts. $250 per blog post. And then I was working. I wrote. The first blog post I wrote was about launchpad. And then after that, I was like, why don't I just lead marketing for you guys? And then they were like, yeah, okay, let's just do it. That's amazing.
00:14:57.550 - 00:15:41.834, Speaker A: That's wild. No, I think, I mean, one, it's extremely hard to actually take the jump and the leap to do something new. And so I always applaud people that are able to do that, because at the time, it is very scary. You run the math. You're like, how much money do I need to survive and to go forward? How difficult is this going to be for me? And you're running all those calculations, and then ultimately, once you do it, you're like, all right, I've done it now. Like, it's time to execute. But it's in some sense kind of comical that after you did all that mental work and were prepping yourself a couple days later, ended up working for Magic Eden.
00:15:41.922 - 00:16:07.440, Speaker B: Yeah, it was pretty wild, and I think, like, and I don't regret it at all, you know, I think magic Eden, for me, has been such a blessing, because I remember when I was job hunting, and, like, one of the reasons I was like, maybe I'll just quit, was like, after you work in hospitality for so long, people look at your resume and they're like, okay, she's a hotel person.
00:16:07.520 - 00:16:08.104, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:08.232 - 00:16:40.616, Speaker B: And it was really hard for me to break out of that. And I remember I went to a career counselor at one point. She had this gridded piece of paper, and she was like, I was like, telling her, oh, I want to, like, you know, kind of want to work in entertainment, or I want to work in media. And in many ways, like, magic Eden is kind of a media company considering we have all these, like, digital content, right but besides the point, I was like, I really want to work in media. I, like, want to do something. I want to do marketing. And she was like, she had this gridded piece of paper.
00:16:40.616 - 00:17:23.430, Speaker B: She was like, well, you're in this square, and you're trying to get to, like, another square, like, over there, but you need to go in order, and you can only go from, like, you know, this square to that square. And so I remember she was, like, sending me job recommendations for taking marketing positions, but they were demotions. And, yeah, you know, there just weren't a lot of people in my court that were just like, you can do it, or, like, you know, I believe I'll take a chance on you. So I was like, fuck all this. Like, I'll just quit. And, yeah, I'm super grateful to the team for taking a chance on me because I do feel like magic Eden has stretched me to my absolute maximum. Like, bandwidth and stress levels, but also potential.
00:17:23.430 - 00:17:29.490, Speaker B: I do feel like it feels very boundless. I'm glad to have the chance to try.
00:17:29.610 - 00:18:20.906, Speaker A: No, I've ultimately kind of gone through a similar thing where I was like, all right, what do I do now? And then? Yeah, it's very hard to find people in your corner, especially when you're trying to make a big jump or do something totally different. Everybody likes to put you in boxes, and you're like, stay in your box. And if you're not in this box, people mentally have a very hard time of being like, all right. They have this experience. They say they can do it, but I haven't seen it, so it doesn't make sense and just go away. And so I'm extremely happy that ultimately you found something and magic Eden and you have worked out so well because it's extremely hard to do that. And I think now it's led you down this path, which is fascinating in itself, I think.
00:18:20.906 - 00:18:32.630, Speaker A: Yeah, taking those jumps is hard, and then when you do the. Take the jump and where it leads you, I mean, in this case, it's kind of a pretty magical story.
00:18:33.450 - 00:18:56.590, Speaker B: Magical, yeah. So, Magicina right now, we have, like, over 100 people. We have, like, 11 million monthly unique sessions or one of the largest apps in crypto, period. Or shall I say dap. And, yeah, it's pretty wild.
00:18:57.010 - 00:19:50.090, Speaker A: It's amazing. No, I mean, I think crypto had a meteoric rise, but magic Eden within that, I mean, ultimately, as you said, was kind of profitable from, like, day one, which is also unique in the crypto space to be making money. But I think, I mean, magic Eden, as we were talking earlier, I think one of the things that has just continuously impressed me is your guys relentless work ethic. And it is extremely hard just knowing, working super long hours at Tesla. It's demanding and draining and exhausting and can push you. A lot of you do grow a lot. And so I would love to kind of dive deep into kind of some of your experience from joining in that October timeframe to today.
00:19:50.090 - 00:20:13.556, Speaker A: What were some of the kind of. Because when you started, Magic Eden, as we talked about, was relatively unknown. Investors were still trying to figure out Solana and what magic Eden was. And then fast forward six, nine months, a year later. Magic Eden is a unicorn. So what were some of, like, the biggest learning lessons from this past year?
00:20:13.748 - 00:20:45.896, Speaker B: Ugh. So much. There's so much to talk about. I think there are different stages of magician as it relates to marketing specifically. So in the beginning, marketing was equaled Twitter. So I was a social media manager, right? And I think the reasons why. So at the time, there was an incumbent on Solana, there was another marketplace, and our job was to displace that volume.
00:20:45.896 - 00:21:41.662, Speaker B: And we did that through a lot of viral marketing. So there were things that we understood from the very beginning that our competitors didn't, which is, number one, the website should reflect the hottest thing that's happening in the ecosystem. So people go to it as a portal for discovery. And even until very recently, I think a lot of marketplaces either were displaying stuff on the front page that were not super relevant, or it was just a list of popular collections. But we always had a carousel and many different carousels from day one. The second thing was people weren't willing to eat the glass of doing viral marketing, but at every collection level. So getting every time, if you remember on Solana, there was a meta before instant listings occurred, where you would wait until the mint finished and then you would list all the secondary collections at once.
00:21:41.662 - 00:22:26.290, Speaker B: But I remember we would get every collection to put us our link in their bio, and we would have them tweet that magic Eden was their preferred secondary marketplace. And doing this over and over and over again, and back in those days, it was a matter of if you got the hot collection of the day, you would get majority market share, and if you didn't, then you wouldn't get market share, period. And so nailing every single line. I remember back in the day, Katie felt super guilty one day cause she didn't catch a launch. I can't remember the name of it, but that was kind of chapter one of marketing at Magic Eden, which was like, can you just grind super hard and go the extra mile that nobody else is willing to do? And it was by Lisbon that I think we reached over 50% market share. That was quick then.
00:22:26.370 - 00:22:28.330, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, two months.
00:22:28.410 - 00:22:59.170, Speaker B: It's also helped that Solana was popping off. So it was just a matter of catching the collections. Right. And then I would say, and I'm making this up on the spot, I think chapter two, marketing of Magic Eden. So in the beginning, it was just like, ship product really, really fast and do a lot of viral marketing. And then chapter two was really like, okay, there are kind of controversies that are going to come up. So in January, because there were so many, if you remember, Solana was known as a derivative chain.
00:22:59.330 - 00:23:14.310, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, ultimately, it was super controversial. I remember even to like you, Solana, at that point in time, it was still very much like the ETH. ETH is the only smart contract platform. And if you use any others, it's like forbidden.
00:23:14.390 - 00:24:45.320, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So then came derivative season where there were a lot of collections that imitated ethereum collections, but there was like, I don't want to name them, but basically you had, like, different types of punks that were related to different ethnicities, or there's a very famous ape on ETH, and there was a version of that on Solana. Anyway, so then we found ourselves in harrier issues, where I was like, oh, well, this is not a product decision. It's an ethical and business decision. Right? And so do you constrain the marketplace and say, okay, only verifiable collections are able to be launched? Or do you allow for openness and, like, anything to be launched? Right. And then create different ways of showing which collections are more bona fide? And so then it was like, oh, we actually have to think about stuff like this, and how do you navigate and how do you make decisions? And then I think there were other challenges along the way. So we started in the beginning, it was just like, how do we make people happy? And then after that, it became like, how do we make more principled decisions and what do we actually stand for? And that has basically been something that we continue to try our best at, knowing that the market moves so quickly that your problem statement constantly changes.
00:24:45.320 - 00:25:45.200, Speaker B: So it's really hard to actually nail down how to actually be consistent in spite of all of these different. Whether it's competitive threats, dynamics that you can't foresee, it's really hard to. To consistently promise anything. But anyway, so I think chapter two is really us learning, okay, we have to make decisions more methodically. And then after that, I'd say chapter three is how do you actually manage and scale a marketing organization that can take on an increasing volume of work? So every role within marketing has become more complex over time. And it's not a matter of just, like, tactically pushing out stuff. We hired from the community very intentionally in the beginning, and now marketing is so complex that everybody's job requires them to figure out how to scale.
00:25:45.200 - 00:26:26.500, Speaker B: So, for example, when we did launchpad marketing, so we promote projects that we launch on our platform. Before, it was just a matter of copy pasting tweets, and now every person has to be, like, a strategic marketing consultant to a project as we bring bigger brands into the space. So I'd say, like, then it was about figuring out how we can train the team and so they can step up and then they can handle these types of really difficult questions. And anyway, just like everything has gotten way more complex over time and, yeah, I think, I just can't even imagine this is what I would be doing.
00:26:27.040 - 00:27:20.746, Speaker A: It is wild. I think a lot of crypto today, in my point of view, is still trying to find product market fit. And I think one of the beautiful things of magic eat and of iterating quickly combined with that viral marketing, initially, you guys found product market fit, and that is something that a lot of teams are still searching for. And so you guys, like the team more broadly, are experiencing problems that I would say a lot of future people in crypto are, but kind of leading the way. And so, yeah, the ethics and making all these decisions, even just outside of just the core product, that is challenging and something that a lot of these other teams haven't even got to because they're still at the product level.
00:27:20.898 - 00:27:50.332, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's pretty hard because especially in the position we are now, every decision is kind of viewed with scrutiny and at least very close attention. If I'm more optimistic. Yeah, it's really, really difficult to make sure you message things the right way or even just approach problems in a way that the community can understand.
00:27:50.476 - 00:28:14.896, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, I mean, also a unique thing specific to crypto is that it is so community driven. I mean, could you maybe talk about some of the differences of managing relationships with, like, brands and your web two job versus web3 and that community aspect, because that is a very unique thing to crypto.
00:28:15.048 - 00:28:51.030, Speaker B: Yeah, super intense. And this is actually where the hospitality kind of comes in and is helpful. I can't imagine anybody being this passionate about any marketplace. I was actually thinking, do people feel this way about eBay? It's just so intense. Or any consumer app. Do people feel this way about Spotify? I don't know. I think it's really hard to build a brand in web3 because especially on Solana, it feels.
00:28:51.030 - 00:30:03.640, Speaker B: And not to just talk about Solana. We're on multiple chains, we're on Eth, and we're going to enter Polygon, actually launch it very soon. I do think a lot of the ethos around web3 sometimes just conflicts with business growth, period, because sometimes there's this attitude of, oh, like, wag me. And it's just so naive, honestly, they're just like, yeah, everyone's gonna help each other. And like, no, it's, you know, especially with marketplaces, it's a zero sum game. So sometimes I do feel like, yeah, it's really hard to bring the community along for a ride where they see things in a very specific way, and it's hard to share the bigger vision of what we're trying to do. For example, there was a lot of controversy about different types of features, and people were like, well, why didn't you partner with other players to build those features? But if those features are actually integral to the marketplace experience, then magic Eden actually has every right to build those features.
00:30:03.640 - 00:30:47.400, Speaker B: Conversely, people have been critical about Launchpad and the quality of projects. But if you think about it, 70% of businesses fail, just in general, 70% of launchpad projects. I think we looked at the analysis of what's the number of launchpad projects that are above min price after we launch them, and it's around 30%. So it's really not that. And people are like, oh, magic Eden doesn't pick projects carefully. No, dude, it's just because projects, most of them, are not going to survive. So I think it's hard to.
00:30:47.400 - 00:31:06.774, Speaker B: I do think some of the assumptions and expectations placed on us are coming from a very idealistic point of view. There's a lot of idealism in Web three, and when you actually talk about results, it's hard to reconcile those two things.
00:31:06.902 - 00:31:44.106, Speaker A: Yeah. And to me, ultimately, that kind of goes back to kind of like taking the jump or being in the arena. And there's definitely a lot of commentators, and I think that's fine. Uh, I do think there should be, everybody's voice should be heard in some sense. But going back to, like, the business aspect, I think it's great that, like, people can compete. I mean, if someone does have a superior product or a different standard or different marketplace, different Dapp that is substantially better than someone else's. Like, that should win.
00:31:44.106 - 00:32:20.848, Speaker A: Uh, it should. Or people should gravitate towards that if it actually provides more value. And so I think today, a lot of it's just so early and it's great in the sense that the community is so passionate, but in the grand scheme of things, so very few users compared to TikTok or Instagram, YouTube, I think everybody's voice is a little bit amplified. But I think at the end of the day, as you said, everybody's trying to work towards a similar thing and everybody's just trying different things to get there.
00:32:21.024 - 00:32:38.136, Speaker B: Yeah. I think right now we live in this bubble of crypto Twitter. And, like, in the long term, if NFTs are really accessible to everyone, it shouldn't just be a matter of who's the most active on Twitter.
00:32:38.168 - 00:32:38.336, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:38.368 - 00:32:54.220, Speaker B: You should have users that are not even on Twitter, but, like, that's the long term that I'm looking at. Right. So when people get upset about, like, really small things. Yeah, I'm less worried about it these days.
00:32:54.340 - 00:33:09.980, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe shifting a little bit. How has magic Eden's vision or goal evolved over time? And what are some things that you're excited about either from the creator standpoint or gaming in the future?
00:33:10.100 - 00:33:39.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I think most NFT marketplaces feel really transactional, and that's one of the things that we're trying to innovate on. So, for example, the earliest signs of that were the drop calendar, where you can upvote different drops. And that is a social feature, but there's intention behind it. Instead of just copy pasting Instagram onto the marketplace. Right. It's alpha driven. So different social insights can actually help you make decisions.
00:33:39.370 - 00:34:24.320, Speaker B: That was why. Also, with our carousels, if you look at the bottom one on the homepage, it says friends are watching. So I think one of the things that we're working on is creating more social experiences and having those insights that be relevant to the user. And when you say social, it's not necessarily between magic Eden and the collector. It's really creating pathways for collectors to interact with each other and then to create pathways for the creator to interact with the collector. So this upcoming week, and maybe by the time this is out, we're actually launching a loyalty program called Magic Heating Rewards. And what that is is every profile.
00:34:24.320 - 00:35:08.202, Speaker B: First of all, you'll be able to collapse all your wallets into one profile, and that represents a master view of your trade activity. This is the first time Logan's actually hearing about this. And so imagine that you are able to have more rewards and fee discounts based on your total trade activity. So that way we are actually doing right by our users and giving the ones who are transacting the most fewer fees. And then when it comes to rewards, what are those rewards? Those rewards can come in different flavors. They can come from the partners and ecosystems, whether those are different apps or. I, I think asset dash is an example of one that we'll partner with.
00:35:08.202 - 00:36:23.742, Speaker B: So they offer discounts to IRL, things like they have a discount to Airbnb, for example, that you can give through our rewards hub, but it also allows for an opportunity for creators to actually reach collectors. So for example, say if a blue chip collection wants to give a bunch of gift boxes, and then some of those gift boxes have rare nfts and they can disperse those gift boxes to the rewards hub, right? So we are creating pathways that are meaningful social experiences, but they're meaningful. So that's kind of one really big thing that we're working on. I think we kind of segment our business into kind of the creator side and then the collector side. So what I just talked about is one of the things we're working on, the collector side, on the creator side, I think there's a lot of ways that we can help creators target their audiences more effectively because most of the trade volume that's happening on Solana is actually via magic Eden and actually provide news and provide incentives for collectors. So one thing you can see on our homepage now is we have this thing called creator announcements and we're literally manually doing it. Really? Yeah, we have this giant Google sheet of all the announcements we're uploading by day, but eventually that will become self serve.
00:36:23.742 - 00:37:22.950, Speaker B: So then different creators can share different pieces of news. Whereas before you had to dig through discord and find the right messages across your 40 discords, that's like the very, very initial stage of something that could be much greater. So allowing creators to encourage collectors to upload content or maybe complete a certain set of tasks, right. And creating a way, think about where they can find insights, where they can reward certain collectors, where they can scale different types of experiences that are revealed via magic Eden. So magic Eden feels like a tool for them rather than just their marketplace. And then for everyone. The marketplace is no longer just this transactional layer, but it's this full journey of discovery through transaction and engagement is the thing that we're trying to unlock.
00:37:23.030 - 00:38:01.568, Speaker A: That's amazing. Yeah. Marketplaces today are very, as you said, kind of transactional. And so I think it's super fascinating. Ultimately, again, what I've been continuously impressed by is just like magic Eden does take a lot of feedback from the community, but ultimately, your rate of iteration is extremely high. And by being able to include some of these social components, it's going to be fascinating to see how it turns out. Have you guys announced that you're doing the Royalties pro or the loyalty program?
00:38:01.624 - 00:38:40.444, Speaker B: Royalties and loyalties, they match. Speaking of royalties, we actually, we're protecting them now on Magic Eden for all new collections that are using a protocol that we created called Open Creator protocol. It is not meant to be a defensive play and block anybody out. We just wanted to deliver something to market quickly because people have been waiting for like two months. But no, we have not announced the loyalty program that's going to be this upcoming week. But, yeah, you've mentioned this a couple times now, and it is true. I think if you had to stack all the marketplaces side by side and say, well, why is magic Eden special? To me, it's definitely our product velocity.
00:38:40.444 - 00:39:13.976, Speaker B: We are just animals. We ship so fast, it's actually insane. I just hired on somebody who used to run product marketing at TikTok, worked at meta, and she was like, I've never seen this pace of work is unprecedented, unprecedented. And I didn't even know that. My own expectations are kind of insane because I've never worked in tech, right? And I was telling her like, yeah, just get someone to write a Twitter thread and we'll push it out tomorrow. And she was like, what? I was like, yeah, most marketing tasks actually take less than 24 hours. Just make a graphic, push out a thread.
00:39:13.976 - 00:39:23.256, Speaker B: The only thing that really requires lead time is when you work with creators to roll out a program or develop high fidelity creative. And this was mind blowing to her.
00:39:23.368 - 00:39:24.320, Speaker A: That's funny.
00:39:24.480 - 00:39:26.432, Speaker B: But yeah, we're animals.
00:39:26.576 - 00:40:14.066, Speaker A: No, it's extremely impressive. I think a lot of people can get bogged down, especially in companies with day to day decisions, and forget at the end of the day, a lot of those decisions, they do matter, but the customer do not see that decision making process, and all they see is what they interact with. I think by continuously changing, updating, pushing forward, and having that be reflected on the customer standpoint is extremely important. And I don't think enough companies take this approach or have the willpower that magic Eden has ultimately put forth. Yeah, I don't think it's by accident. Magic Eden is where it is today.
00:40:14.178 - 00:40:49.080, Speaker B: Thanks. Yeah, in the beginning, it was just like, okay, so one of the earliest sources of FUD that we got was like, oh, like, why does this marketplace have a launchpad? Isn't that a conflict of interest? Cause you're promoting different projects. And then the common consensus was like, yeah, imagine eating your secondary marketplace is great, but just let go of the launch pad. Just don't do that. Stop that. And even though there were launches that didn't go well, like Balloonsville, Degentown, everybody knows, right. Obviously it's a really important model that now.
00:40:49.080 - 00:41:35.052, Speaker B: I mean, even the biggest NFT marketplace has a launchpad now, right? We were the first on Solana to debut that model. And I think it's incredibly important and meaningful to have primaries and secondaries connected together. And so, yeah, back to the point of like, if we listened to everything the community was saying, we wouldn't not have been able to grow. And, yeah, like, if you do everything the community wants, they'll just like, you know, it's the things that they want a token, they want fee discounts and, you know, they want free shit. Right. But it's really up to you to frame up like, okay, what are the underlying values of what they're seeking? And then how do you deliver that in like a more powerful experience.
00:41:35.236 - 00:41:36.124, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:41:36.292 - 00:41:44.450, Speaker B: And having that insight and actually like nothing, not just always relenting, is, I think, one of the things that makes us really iconic.
00:41:45.710 - 00:42:44.948, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, going back even to your journey initially where you wanted to go from one industry to another, I'd say more broadly, people just don't like change. And whether it's a job change or a big product change, or going from a BlackBerry with keyboard to an iPhone that doesn't have a keyboard, people kind of like staying in their lane ultimately. And then it does take time for people to get adjusted to the new thing. No, but it has been impressive, ultimately being able to understand the core thing that the community wants or would like to, listening to the feedback and then making those product updates. And it's not always like everybody's going to be perfect, but going back to iterating fast, if you can continue to iterate, most likely you'll end up at a better spot than others quicker.
00:42:45.084 - 00:42:49.920, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think so. We're really not afraid of just making a lot of mistakes.
00:42:52.020 - 00:42:53.320, Speaker A: It's part of the process.
00:42:53.620 - 00:43:23.414, Speaker B: Yeah. And then it's like you have to think about how to create a brand for that. So I think that was also a learning journey for me. Wherever, if you actually look at the ways that we've described ourselves, it's kind of evolved over time. So at one point we were really proud of how community centric we were, and I'm still proud of that. Right. But we called ourselves a community oriented marketplace, but we don't really call ourselves that anymore.
00:43:23.414 - 00:43:51.278, Speaker B: Not because we don't care about the community, but it's because like, that is nothing. Our compass, our compass is delivering the best marketplace and platform experience that's going to onboard a whole new journey, a whole new type in different categories of creators and collectors. And we can't be kind of constrained to the thoughts of crypto Twitter continuing.
00:43:51.334 - 00:44:26.884, Speaker A: Forth on that social dynamic. How, I guess we are kind of in the small echo Twitter chamber by building these new products. Do you envision bringing? I think the next bull run ultimately will be pulled in by more users. So how are you trying to create these projects? So it's not just twitter users, it's the everyday person or maybe skeptic of NFT to try out kind of a bridging out into like the web3 creator ecosystem.
00:44:26.972 - 00:45:33.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of big brands are watching and thinking like, well, what's our use case for nfts? And one of the biggest use cases is actually loyalty. The problem is that there's no way to connect the holders of an NFT to the entire system that these companies have created for their loyalty. Programs like those systems right now are completely disparate. Right. How do you put somebody's wallet address when your other system has their name and their email and whatever? But I think as we create that kind of infrastructure, the loyalty program in particular is just showing how you can use NFTs to engage audiences in a very novel and untraditional way. So I think the reason why all these brands are looking at is because they're like, oh, well, this could be really how communities are built and formed and mobilized, and I want a piece of that. So if Magic Eden can help deliver that, then I think that's super meaningful.
00:45:33.350 - 00:46:01.210, Speaker B: How we do it and how the brands we work with can actually engage those communities over time is like another question and how that plugs into their systems. But, yeah, ultimately, I think for the creator side, it's really that magic Eden is this conduit for you to engage with the right people at the right time, in the right way?
00:46:01.330 - 00:47:04.120, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that. Yeah, I'm really excited ultimately for more users. It's comical to me today when I pull up not any specific application, but just ecosystems more broadly and seeing their lifetime users. It's still very small, but I'm optimistic now that the infrastructure, just the core protocols, are getting to a point where they can actually support more users and then applications built on top of them will be able to onboard them as well, because with Solana specifically, we've seen it going down and that affects you guys directly. Yeah. So ultimately having more stability, essentially having in some sense, the web two analogy, like faster Internet or faster speeds, transaction speeds or more transactions, just being able to onboard more users. But it's an interesting journey.
00:47:04.120 - 00:47:08.444, Speaker A: Yeah. It's been a crazy year for you.
00:47:08.572 - 00:47:14.244, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm pretty tired. Yeah, yeah. How are you doing?
00:47:14.412 - 00:47:51.304, Speaker A: Good. No, I mean, I try to go outside more now. It's nice. We're currently in Miami, so nice to be outside and walk. I think ultimately, as you mentioned earlier, Twitter or crypto in the ecosystem is much broader than specifically Twitter. I think because majority of conversations in our industry happen there. We're glued to Twitter and our screens, and obviously, that's not even our main job.
00:47:51.304 - 00:48:16.286, Speaker A: That's in addition to just to keep up with all the craziness that's going on, by being able to step away or realize that's nothing, the entire ecosystem has been beneficial, and being able to kind of stop and ultimately just take a break for a little time, I think is important. Yesterday I played pickleball and didn't look at my computer, and it was super refreshing.
00:48:16.438 - 00:48:27.130, Speaker B: Sounds amazing. Yeah, definitely. I think I've been, like, carving out time to just. Yeah. Kind of exist outside of magic Eden, too.
00:48:27.710 - 00:48:43.030, Speaker A: That's important. I mean, ultimately, I think when you do work, it's not like your brain is constantly in overdrive. You can sit down and process things. And so I think ultimately, by stepping back, it allows us to do a better job just in our day to day.
00:48:43.110 - 00:48:44.718, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
00:48:44.814 - 00:50:01.286, Speaker A: It is hard. Crypto, I think just because the meteoric rise of blockchain and crypto more broadly has put everybody on edge. And it's kind of, in the last couple of years, kind of money falling from the sky in some sense, that everybody was just running around with buckets trying to catch their money. And so now that things are slowing down, people have a little bit time to breathe. I think, honestly, it's good for the industry to focus on themselves personally, mentally and physically, and then ultimately kind of reassess what are we building? Why is it important and what are we ultimately doing this for? No, I think it's awesome that, I mean, you've obviously yourself and magic Eden have been pushed extremely hard and had a lot of success for that. But now ultimately being able to step back, reflect on it, even conversations like this, we were talking, and I don't think we realize how crazy all this is. And going from a idea to a product to a billion dollar company in a year leading that effort is astounding.
00:50:01.286 - 00:50:15.654, Speaker A: And so in some sense, I like doing these podcasts just to be able to kind of document this journey, because we are spearheading a new industry and I'm just appreciative to be a part of it.
00:50:15.742 - 00:50:53.020, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, me too. Yeah. It's pretty wild that we created this thing in a year, and I think there's just so much endurance on the team that I'm super impressed with. And it's hard, too, right, as a company that has over 100 people to figure out how to all work together and how to deliver. And, like, internally, there's still a lot of stuff that we could do better. And syncing the way engineering works with marketing or product works with engineering, like, there's so much stuff to sort through.
00:50:53.020 - 00:51:44.520, Speaker B: But the fact that we haven't lost that pace is, like, incredible to me. Right. And that, you know, Sid, our CTO and I are very similar in one way, in that we joke that we're both apes, right? So imagine, like, all the stuff that we build, maybe it's not perfect, but we ship it and we try it. And on the marketing side, like, hey, maybe the images that we launch with, we don't have, like, the most beautiful, creative, but, like, it's done. We slapped something on it and we tried it. And that constant spirit of experimentation is something that's very, very native to magic Eden. And, yeah, I mean, we want to be like that one powerful app that crosses chains, that makes people think outside of the framework of a chain.
00:51:44.520 - 00:51:52.750, Speaker B: Right. And once there are really powerful consumer experiences, then people will come.
00:51:53.930 - 00:52:12.820, Speaker A: Ultimately, I would love to get to the point where people don't know essentially what chain they're on, but they're just using the product. And the product is so easy that ultimately they don't know that they're even using blockchain in some sense, but they get that functionality. I like the vision.
00:52:12.900 - 00:52:14.160, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks.
00:52:16.460 - 00:53:02.390, Speaker A: I guess, ultimately, how? I think even though our industry is crazy, it is stressful. We work very hard. People, even after recent events with kind of FTX and the bear market, people still want to get involved in web3, crypto or the crater economy. What would your advice be to individuals that are looking to get into the ecosystem, especially with your journey ultimately going from one industry to another in your first hand experience, how would you. What would your advice be to others wanting to get involved?
00:53:03.410 - 00:54:03.780, Speaker B: Just how to join this space in particular? Okay. If I think about how I would have given myself advice, like, a year ago, number one is to pick the right team. It's the team over everything. And in the toughest moments at Magic Eden, it's the team that has kept me here, because I think, by and large, we're not very ego driven, the co founders especially. And then that permeates through the rest of the team, and we're just super, super persistent and able to get stuff done. And it's like, who can you imagine training yourself to for the next five years? Like, really, like, can you survive? Not just an airport lounge test, but can you really be in the same room as this guy for the next five years? Besides that, I'd say, like, kind of figure out what you can bring to the table, because web3 is so undefined, and this is a space where boxes actually don't exist. And so a lot of my experience from hospitality actually lent itself well to.
00:54:03.780 - 00:54:27.174, Speaker B: In ways that I couldn't possibly foresee. Right. And I was kind of, like, willing to try. So I hosted Twitter spaces every day for, like, you know, the first two months. Right. And that is an act of hospitality and connection. And being able to always connect with people was actually what got magic Eden through some of the toughest periods.
00:54:27.174 - 00:55:14.146, Speaker B: Right. So what is your special sauce, and what can you do? And then I'd say the economy around NFTs is still relatively informal. Right. And so whether or not you have a full time job or you're just helping out different people, building a portfolio is so critical in web3 because people want to know what you can deliver. So just engaging with people and being willing to connect and, yeah, not being afraid of putting something in the world is probably the most critical. So, for example, I remember this woman wanted to work for us as a designer, and ultimately we didn't hire her, but we talked to her. She made a resume that looked like the magic Eden sight.
00:55:14.146 - 00:55:29.290, Speaker B: It used all of our UI, and I was like, oh, my God, this is brilliant. And, yeah, I think this is just a space that really favors the bold. Fortune favors the bold, but especially in web3. Yeah, I don't know. What would you say? I feel like my answers are kind of generic.
00:55:29.330 - 00:56:14.010, Speaker A: No, no. I mean, I definitely agree. I think it is a little challenging, especially if you're not on Twitter. If someone tells me they're in crypto but not on Twitter, I'm like, yeah, I don't know if I believe you, but yeah, I would definitely echo, I mean, just contributing. I mean, me personally, I felt like I wasn't as good at the community side as you. I was really interested in the tech and I didn't know how to get in intertwined with the community. And so I decided to buy this podcast stuff too, as my way.
00:56:14.010 - 00:57:07.134, Speaker A: But I think ultimately it leads back to what you said is contributing on the engineering side, like writing code or community side, hosting those spaces, getting involved, helping NFT projects, helping dapps tell their story. I think storytelling is extremely important. I guess this is a form of storytelling. But yeah, ultimately just getting involved in some shape or form and then eventually, if you're persistent, I think doors will ultimately open up. And because the industry, I think a lot of people think the industry is kind of locked down today or not malleable. And it's extremely, extremely early just in terms of users. And I think ultimately what the space will become.
00:57:07.134 - 00:57:12.406, Speaker A: And so if you can contribute, you'll definitely have a very long lasting career.
00:57:12.518 - 00:58:00.502, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think it's kind of funny, but I actually joined Magic Eden with like, most of my resume was not marketing, but I was just willing to try and yeah, obviously I was also very lucky. But yeah, I think people see web3 as just really intimidating sometimes, but it really is just a matter of being bold enough to reach out to people. I was trying to reach out to this game on Polygon yesterday, and so what I did, I couldn't. They weren't replying to my twitter DM's. So I just, on telegram, I like, searched for the game and then I found their mod and I just messaged their mod and the mod responded. Really? You just have to think of this shit.
00:58:00.566 - 00:58:18.310, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even going back to earlier in the conversation, you were saying how you got some of your jobs from DM's. I think now, the interesting thing for me, being in this position and learning people's stories, how people, and kind of going after what they want, a lot of them through like cold emails or.
00:58:18.430 - 00:58:24.426, Speaker B: DM's emails, wasn't easy. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
00:58:24.618 - 00:58:38.578, Speaker A: But like, pursuing what you want, I think, is very, very empowering. And a lot of people are afraid to take that first step. But by shooting your shot and being creative, it will get you very far.
00:58:38.674 - 00:59:19.412, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's like this delicate balance. It's like, yeah, be creative and shoot your shot, but do it in a way that's like authentic and doesn't ever compromise your credibility? Cause that's all you have at the end of the day. And I think, yeah, there are a lot of, especially in marketing for me, I have to be really, really careful. Cause people tend to oversell themselves. But yeah, I think when I find someone who is able to be really thoughtful and also is super ambitious and really risk loving, that is amazing. That's the best combination.
00:59:19.516 - 00:59:59.340, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, no, I mean, I really do think your journey and magic Eden journey, how those are intertwined, how you both have risen very quickly are fascinating. And so I truly appreciate the opportunity to sit down and chat and learn from you and ultimately the experiences of this past year because it's not normal. You guys have done extremely impressive things. You personally are extremely impressive. The viral marketing ideas, you're very impressive. Logan.
00:59:59.340 - 01:00:09.900, Speaker A: It's hard to do. And so, yeah, no, appreciate what you do for the communities and what you do for magic Eden. Maybe to wrap up the conversation.
01:00:11.760 - 01:00:12.048, Speaker B: What.
01:00:12.064 - 01:00:24.120, Speaker A: Are some things that you're excited for? Maybe on the creator or NFT side for 2023? What are you excited on the magic Eden front for 2023 and then crypto more broadly?
01:00:24.700 - 01:00:32.880, Speaker B: Okay, so yeah, on the creator and collector side, I mean, there's a really long roadmap and I'm not exactly sure what I can or can't say.
01:00:33.540 - 01:00:34.716, Speaker A: Share the alpha.
01:00:34.868 - 01:01:06.850, Speaker B: The alpha. I think I'll just say on the creator side. I'll just stick to the creator side. The Creator Hub right now is a very tactical experience where you just list a collection. And I think creators who want to launch projects on Magic Eden will be able to self serve in a very different way than exists today.
01:01:08.670 - 01:01:11.130, Speaker A: I like it. Just a couple sprinkles.
01:01:14.190 - 01:01:59.820, Speaker B: It will not feel like Magic Eden is this ivory fortress that you only use for your secondary marketplace. Magic Eden will just be yours for you to do what you need to do to reach all the users that use magic Eden. So that's super exciting. What am I excited about for Magic Eden? I think I'm really excited specifically for the marketing team. I'll just talk about my team. We have eleven people right now, and being able to grow the team to take on the scope and complexity of challenges is something that fills me with both dread as well as excitement. It's fucking hard, man.
01:01:59.820 - 01:02:21.336, Speaker B: It's like trying to get an ex community manager to grok what product marketing is. It's really hard. But I'm really excited to see that growth trajectory for the team and I'm excited to see how we're gonna get out of the bear, you know, like, it feels really hard right now.
01:02:21.408 - 01:02:25.832, Speaker A: Yeah, it feels bad.
01:02:25.936 - 01:02:52.652, Speaker B: Yeah. And I remember there were a lot of people who joined Magic Eden when everything went up. I was like, you guys are not ready for down season. But now we're in down season, and I think the team is becoming very resilient. So that's good to see. And I'm excited for them to continue to grow and develop crypto more broadly. I just.
01:02:52.652 - 01:03:33.540, Speaker B: I'm ready for, like, the on ramps to be less difficult. And I think you can see innovations with, you know, stuff like cupcake is a protocol that was developed by B and J studios that allows for people to, like, claim NFTs or SFTs with the tap of a phone. Like, those are really cool use cases that I think nfts could be both the front end facing, community led creator experience that we know today. But also, there's just so much infrastructure. Nfts can be the back end verification of luxury goods or any good. Right. And for us to kind of explore those types of use cases would be really cool.
01:03:33.540 - 01:03:47.680, Speaker B: And to have that integrate with real life in general, just want the space to feel less like we're floating in the ether by ourselves and more like this is relevant for everyday living. That's what I'm excited about.
01:03:47.800 - 01:03:48.816, Speaker A: I love it.
01:03:49.008 - 01:03:54.464, Speaker B: Well, what about you? What's just the one thing you're excited.
01:03:54.512 - 01:04:26.140, Speaker A: About in general, in crypto? I really want more. Users love nfts for the fact, I think they. I mean, I got into crypto in 2017, kind of during that bull market, and kept with it through the bear market, ultimately, which allowed me to be in the spot today. But I think one thing that caught a lot of people off guard were nfts. But I am very appreciative of nfts for what they have done for crypto more broadly in terms of user adoption.
01:04:26.220 - 01:04:28.156, Speaker B: And culture creation and culture.
01:04:28.228 - 01:05:29.338, Speaker A: Yeah, they're really, I mean, they push, they're creating a new culture, which is fascinating. And so watching that culture, like Internet, native culture, develop through nfts and seeing that prolificate into, I mean, society, and it took culture by storm and just what it did for the user adoption, I was surprised. But to answer your question, I'm very excited for more users. I think today we have kind of been handicapped by a lot of the infrastructure, just the core protocols, unfortunately. But I think now there exists a clear path for that infrastructure to scale. And I'm very excited for application engineers to not have to focus on protocols and just focus on your core product. And if you scale, don't worry about it.
01:05:29.338 - 01:06:02.550, Speaker A: Like the protocol will support it. And so by having those different levels of abstractions, I think application engineers will build better apps. And ultimately that will result in more users. I'm excited for users. I want to get out of the circular token, go up or type. I think the truly only way to do that is get actual users and user adoption. I'm excited for that.
01:06:03.530 - 01:06:14.436, Speaker B: I'm just so excited we got out of this royalty hell, to be honest, because Magic Eden is a deeply creator centric business and we never wanted to be in this. This city.
01:06:14.548 - 01:06:15.588, Speaker A: A lot of hard choices.
01:06:15.644 - 01:06:55.048, Speaker B: Yeah, really hard choices. And happy that we can now respect royalties on magic Eden. Because ultimately what you're talking about culture creation, right? Nfts are the best vehicle for creating subcultures on the blockchain. And when people just want to be involved for the love of self expression, that simplistic of a desire, that's ultimately what's going to bring people in. Not that like the person who doesn't really understand chains or whatever. It'll just be this cool thing that they can use to show people who they are. I'm excited to support creators and bring in new collectors.
01:06:55.144 - 01:07:22.486, Speaker A: I love it. We'll end it there. Thank you so much for sharing your story, Tiff. It is a special one. What you guys have built is special and excited for what you and the team will continue to build at Magic Eden and I. Hopefully we'll continue to watch how many new users who bring in and ultimately the culture that develops because of what magic Eden has built. So thank you.
01:07:22.518 - 01:07:24.030, Speaker B: Cool, thank you so much. Thanks for having me.
