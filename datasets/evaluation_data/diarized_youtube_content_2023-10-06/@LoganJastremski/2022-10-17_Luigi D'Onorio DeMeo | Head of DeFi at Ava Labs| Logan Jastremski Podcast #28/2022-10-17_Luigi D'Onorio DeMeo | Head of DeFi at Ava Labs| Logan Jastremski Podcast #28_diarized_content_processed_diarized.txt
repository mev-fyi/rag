00:00:00.920 - 00:00:23.390, Speaker A: No, again, super excited that you're here, Luigi. Thank you. I think maybe to just kind of recap kind of what we've talked about a little bit initially is just kind of an overview of the avalanche kind of ecosystem and where it stands today. And then we can kind of keep rolling for there. Apologies.
00:00:23.510 - 00:01:00.582, Speaker B: Sure. No, it's all good. So, yeah, so avalanche really got started, I would say with Defi about 1415 months ago. That's where it really got a lot of its traction. That happened on the Avalanche C chain, which is the EVM compatible chain that most people that know avalanche have been directed with so far. So DeFi really got kicked off with the launch of the Avalanche bridge, which was best UX bridge, I think, at least in my very biased opinion, across crypto. And also the launch of avalanche rush program which allowed for user incentive program for DeFi.
00:01:00.582 - 00:01:39.090, Speaker B: So from the DeFi perspective, I think we sit in a really interesting place. We talked a little bit about the macro conditions which are not favorable to DeFi at the moment. Yeah. And what I mean by that is simply that interest rates in tradfi have actually probably inverted Defi yields, meaning that the risk free rate in Trapfi is higher than, than Defi at this point with additional risk in Defi. So from that standpoint, there's a lot of work to be done. But however, I'm really, really bullish on the core primitives and we can talk about this to whatever length you'd like later on. But I think Avalanche sits in a very unique spot as it relates to Defi and I'm super excited about that.
00:01:39.090 - 00:02:27.850, Speaker B: On the gaming side, we've made a lot of progress and sort of, I think, really established ourselves. And part of this has to do with the architecture, avalanche in general, which lends itself to being a favorable change of deployment from it from a gaming perspective. But it also lends itself to, number one, the focus we put in the niche and also the team, the team that we have, Ed Chang, formerly EA and some of the guys there are really crushing it on our side. So excited for a few of the games we've announced one shrapnel which if you haven't got a chance yet, take a look at the trailer. That's a really cool game that's going to be launching on Avalanche. We also have various other ones. Pipeline is quite strong on the gaming side and I think there'll be some pretty cool announcements coming forward soon on that front.
00:02:27.850 - 00:03:44.152, Speaker B: On the NFT side, we have what I would call green shoots as it relates to that, the deployment from OpenSea as well as Jo Pegs, which is the new native marketplace deployed, has really started to capture the community's excitement. So starting to see volume really pick up across nfts. On Avalanche, which I'm excited about, having a chain that doesn't really have a lot of downtime, has a ton of stability, lends itself to be well suited for nfts as well as how quiescent the consensus is, allows itself to be a pretty green blockchain as well. So from that perspective, I think it's interesting on the NFT side and then lastly on the institutional side, KKR, it was the recent announcement $450 billion fund has launched a private token offering. Not private, a token offering for qualified purchasers on one of their funds, which is really interesting. A great use case for crypto, one we've talked about in the space since like 2017. So excited to see, you know, it's not easy for a fund in a firm like that, I think, to publicly say anything but also to actually do anything in this space.
00:03:44.152 - 00:03:57.568, Speaker B: So super pumped about that and also excited to see where that goes because Avalanche has from the beginning said that it wants to digitize the world's assets and that's prime use case of that for sure.
00:03:57.704 - 00:05:11.880, Speaker A: I think it's a great mission and honestly a lot of great updates on the avalanche side and excited to kind of see things progress. I think it's been super interesting just watching the technical updates roll out while also kind of see the community with the more grassroots community spin up on Avalanche as well. So it's been fun to watch Avalanche and honestly speak with the team throughout the year and just kind of see all the stuff that you guys are building. So maybe, I think we touched upon it briefly, but maybe we can just touch upon it once more as kind of the overview of the avalanche architecture. The main chain is obviously the c chain, which is EVM compatible, allows engineers to quickly port over Ethereum applications. But then there's also kind of this novel concept of subnets and you've touched upon it and your kind of thoughts and maybe kind of projecting into the future what is kind of where do you see kind of subnets sitting in the holistic ecosystem and how do you see them playing out?
00:05:13.340 - 00:06:18.040, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So subnets are core to what avalanche is building and has been building for a long time. I think a lot of people have commented and joked that avalanche is like a geth fork or things like this. This is like kind of silly in a lot of ways because from the very beginning, from the first paper, I don't know, maybe like three or four years ago, whenever it was, it was very clear that avalanche intended to build a network of blockchains that were uniquely interconnected and bound by the avalanche consensus, which is the innovation we first brought. So from that perspective, being able to have sub second finality across chains without sacrificing on the decentralization of the validator set, that is a huge innovation from the get, but that's only the first one we brought. Subnets is a very low level architecture in the sense that it allows for a lot of creativity and flexibility. So we've been working hard on our subnet EVM, which is kind of like our SDK for EVM based subnets.
00:06:18.040 - 00:07:19.694, Speaker B: This allows for people to quickly deploy. I think there was sort of like this contest at one point of how fast people could deploy subnet EVM, and I think the fastest was like 30 seconds or something like that. So it's gotten pretty quick. But this allows for you to deploy your own EVM based chain that kind of can be connected to the I Blanche architecture in terms of the P chain validator set. So we're seeing that, but we're also seeing some customization of that SDK in the sense by virtue of staple precompiles. Right now, I think there's a precompile to update your fees of the network quite easily, which is nice. So whether or not it's a elastic subnet, which is permissionless, or a permission subnet, you still want the ability to manage fees, whether or not that's via governance on an elastic subnet of an application, or on a permission one completely by the owner of the subnet.
00:07:19.694 - 00:07:28.534, Speaker B: So this allows for a lot of interesting, I think, tokenomic models going forward. And that's what I was.
00:07:28.622 - 00:07:36.090, Speaker A: I'm super interested to see the tokenomics kind of play out, especially with me too, the native subnets. It will be interesting to watch.
00:07:36.960 - 00:08:40.336, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be really intriguing, because on one hand the token provides, I mean, the subnet provides a token, a ton of utility that it didn't previously have with respect to gas fees and also staking and validation. On the other hand, like a lot of people have used tokens as incentive mechanism for the application and liquidity mining and things like this. So intriguing to see how they pick apart and pull these pieces together. You know, from my standpoint and from the standpoint, from when I first got into space, I always thought these things needed to be their own chains if they were able to be connected because I could never understand or accept the idea that another application's activity was interrupting a completely separate application. This happens very, very rarely in web two. If like AWS has an outage, everybody's done. But in general, if Uber is having a ton of activity and Facebook isn't, the Facebook users aren't impacted.
00:08:40.336 - 00:09:00.116, Speaker B: To me, this is always an unacceptable sort of way to architect the system. So interested to kind of see how this all plays out, but I think it does lend itself to a whole new space of economic modeling. That's something I'm supremely excited about.
00:09:00.268 - 00:09:47.300, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I'm excited to watch it unfold as well. I think it'll be super interesting, especially on the gaming side, and kind of how the gaming markets ultimately kind of unfold. I think a lot of people kind of across the board, builders in the space and investors are very interesting now in kind of like the gaming narrative and how that ultimately going forward will help kind of drive adoption into the space. So maybe kind of touch upon, and I think you did briefly with the announcement of a new game, but kind of touch upon how gaming and subnets ultimately kind of interact together and can help kind of. Or when paired together can kind of be a more ideal solution in your guys eyes.
00:09:48.080 - 00:10:22.416, Speaker B: Sure. So gaming has always been, I think, uniquely tied to blockchains, number one. I think it's just like sort of the demographic, which is pretty simple, similar in gaming and crypto. It was like very young men and sometimes women who are playing these games a lot of screen time. And so this is obviously a core demographic that the blockchain group wants to go after. Also, there's just like, generally this is a problem where this is like an area where centralization typically has issues. Right.
00:10:22.416 - 00:11:17.648, Speaker B: I think famously Vitalik started like Ethereum because of World Warcraft pissed him off. And so I think spending a lot of time on something that ultimately you don't really get any reward for, other than your personal satisfaction of winning, is sort of a challenge. So I think what we've experienced so far in our conversations with various gaming, whether they're web, two ones, or new ones spinning up, is that the idea of owning in game assets and having those assets, like, sort of persist is incredibly interesting. Like, I always go back to Pokemon, which is a game that I played a lot. Maybe I'm dating myself a little bit, but, you know, I spent a lot of time, like, building up my Pokemon and sort of like really, you know, leveling them up and whatnot. And, you know, at the end. Yeah, I beat, like, you two and everything.
00:11:17.648 - 00:12:21.126, Speaker B: That was great. But like, you know, it would have been really cool to continue to own those Pokemon and like, the world, to like, you know, rather than deploy like, Pokemon Yellow and silver and all these other things. Like have those characters continue to live on and, you know, be tradable. Like, I think that's pretty unique on itself, right? So you can really build a really cool gaming economy. And this is also interesting because, like, from a regulatory perspective, by the way, this is not legal advice, but from a legatory perspective, I think it's interesting because gaming isn't meant to be in a lot of ways, like investment focused or financial in a lot of ways. So I think keeping it light and fun from that perspective, it allows for a perfect use case to go live and also can get people interested in terms of them being able to actually, you know, own the assets, make money on the assets, feel more engaged and feel like they own part of the game, which is like the next step that I think we'll start to see as well.
00:12:21.278 - 00:13:05.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm definitely kind of excited for the games. I think it's will be. I think gaming in general, just like designing a game and trying to build one is definitely a challenge. But I'm excited about kind of web3 native builders kind of building out different games and more. So just bringing user adoption into kind of the blockchain ecosystem. I think there is a lot of kind of TVL brought into these ecosystems the past couple years, but not as many users as I would like. So I'm excited that the gaming is definitely kind of pulling that, hopefully, user base in over the long term, which will be fun to watch.
00:13:05.790 - 00:13:51.360, Speaker B: Yeah, I think also, I think the gaming sector will be less focused on some of these more crypto native tenants that DeFi sort of had to adhere to. I think it'll be fine for a game to have custodial wallets if it wants to. It doesn't have to, but I think it'll be fine if it does. I think it's fine if, like, a game sort of has a permission chain if that's what it wants to do. Like, these are things that DeFi would completely struggle with because it's sort of against the ethos. But I think gaming will be afforded more leeway, which will allow for more adoption and better ux. So I'm kind of excited to see that because it's sort of hard to, you know, it's sort of hard to go from like the grunge era.
00:13:51.360 - 00:13:55.364, Speaker B: To kind of be pop, right? It's like sort of an issue a.
00:13:55.372 - 00:14:32.880, Speaker A: Lot of times, for sure. No, the UX kind of definitely remains a challenge across the board and I think ultimately the people and designers that are able to abstract a lot of those complexities, however they may do so, will definitely unlock a lot. And so excited for that as well. Touching upon Defi, I think there's kind of being the head of Defi, I'm sure there's a lot of kind of interesting things happening behind the scenes and under the hoods and just even popular subnets. Could you touch upon just what you're excited about in the avalanche ecosystem on the defi side as well?
00:14:33.620 - 00:15:07.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we are uniquely positioned in a lot of ways on the defi side. Being a layer one in particular I think is pretty important from a defi perspective. This is one area where I will say L2s I think are less interesting. I'll be very upfront from DeFi in particular. I think they're less interesting because they are completely centralized. There is a completely. There is a completely centralized MEV collector.
00:15:07.300 - 00:15:47.282, Speaker B: Whether or not that MEV collector decides to act nefariously is a different story. But I think from a regulatory perspective, having one entity being able to order transactions is sort of, if I had to go somewhere played, I would probably go there. So I think that's going to be an issue. So being a layer one in general I think affords us really interesting opportunity. On the DeFi side, we've also, the team in general from other labs has a very rich tradfi background. Myself, I was at Citigroup for six years or so. I traded credit default swaps and equities and various things like that.
00:15:47.282 - 00:16:17.570, Speaker B: So we have a pretty tradfi heavy background. So that lends itself to also a network of potential builders. So we got started, I'd say 14 months ago. Like I said on Defi, a lot of that was sort of ethereum based applications deploying to avalanche. But at the same time we were nurturing and developing our own like sort of native ecosystem of dapps. And since then we've sort of seen some of those take off like we've seen Trader Joe has done really well. There's yield.
00:16:17.570 - 00:16:57.726, Speaker B: Yakwis has been around for a long time. GMX is, has really started to do well. I'm forgetting a bunch of them and they're going to get mad at me. But there's a bunch of really cool applications that have deployed. But what I'm most excited about right now is the development that's been going on for the last four or five months. Since then, we made a very concerted effort, at least on my team side, of finding our own unique builders who had a very sort of sophisticated finance experience combined with computer science. And I think the original DeFi applications that you see are pretty basic from a finance perspective.
00:16:57.726 - 00:17:34.475, Speaker B: An Amm is something that's been around for a very long time. It's not super complicated. So we've started to bring in some PhDs, some very, very well known HFT people to build DeFi applications on avalanche. And those are things that'll be sort of coming online the next six months. So I'm pretty excited to see kind of our efforts and also the avalanche community take on a personality of its own. From the DeFi side, this is like, was always the intention. I think from our standpoint, we never intend to rent.
00:17:34.475 - 00:17:46.430, Speaker B: I think on an ongoing basis, it's expensive. So excited to see what those guys build and what we can bring to the Defi ecosystem across all chains, frankly, definitely.
00:17:47.570 - 00:17:56.658, Speaker A: I definitely agree with you on a lot of those fronts. I think, I mean, I could talk for hours about the l, two nuances and technical details.
00:17:56.714 - 00:17:57.842, Speaker B: Probably should have went there.
00:17:57.986 - 00:18:24.860, Speaker A: It's all good. I definitely agree. I do think ultimately a lot of these, whether it's a L2, which in itself is kind of a separate blockchain in many regards, or I a layer one, I think ultimately having that fast finality and being able to have at least a minimum level of decentralization is very important. And totally agree with you on that regard.
00:18:25.360 - 00:18:54.556, Speaker B: I think. I think, and this isn't like, it's tough because it's so tribal out there. But this isn't meant to be a massive criticism of what a L2 is. I think a L2 is incredibly useful for a lot of use cases. I think it actually is optimal for some use cases. But for Defi in particular, I think it's not optimal at all. A few reasons, like one of the examples I like to say is L2 is like sending a check versus cash.
00:18:54.556 - 00:19:41.730, Speaker B: So the check and bounce. And when you're doing finance, that's the one thing you can have happen. If you have essential limit order book and there's a transaction that occurs, very large transaction, and in a certain amount of time, you find out that that transaction is invalidated. Well, the ordering of all the transactions after that were contingent upon that one happening. Not from like the blockchain perspective, although also from that, but from the financial perspective, right? Somebody tried to like, let's say they try to hit like $100 million of bitcoin and they thought they hit it and they didn't. Well, that has ramifications. And if that can be reordered or canceled or invalidated, then that sort of is very similar than the system we have right now in tradfi.
00:19:41.730 - 00:20:01.810, Speaker B: I have issues with that because I do believe what was really cool about bringing finance to blockchains was the ability to have finalized transactions very fast in a way that was decentralized, transparent, and couldn't be reordered unless you had some sort of consensus attack on the chain, for sure.
00:20:02.310 - 00:20:14.134, Speaker A: I definitely agree. I'm in the near future going to also be having some of the founders of some of the more popular L2s on Ethereum podcasts. Definitely excited.
00:20:14.182 - 00:20:15.038, Speaker B: I like them a lot.
00:20:15.134 - 00:21:03.930, Speaker A: No, I like everybody. I definitely have my own kind of personal takes. But no, I think ultimately when people ask me about the different nuances of blockchains and even L2s and their different architectures, I always say that they'll all work. It's just kind of what you're trying to optimize for in the end, and then kind of what you think is technically possible. But yeah, I think a lot of it on Twitter can get personal, but it's definitely not personal, just kind of different engineering points of view. But I think one of the other challenging parts is a lot of this, like the communities want to be involved, but it's kind of trying to like teach computer science to, uh, someone that, uh, doesn't have like an engineering background can be a little tough.
00:21:04.510 - 00:21:31.952, Speaker B: Yeah. And, and also a lot of times it's, you know, a lot of these various communities are trying to get adoption. And so, you know, admitting your shortfalls are a hard way to get adoption, frankly, and so on. Subnets in particular, like, to be frank, I mean, a lot of our subnets prior to Banff going live are pretty centralized as well. Right. I think that's not a surprise to a lot of people. But, you know, it's very clear that we have the upgrade available.
00:21:31.952 - 00:22:11.108, Speaker B: And so just being honest about where the technology sits right now is important. But also, if it's super centralized, you want to be careful with what kind of value is sitting on those various things. And that's why we don't have permission defi subnets before Banff, really, because you don't want a bunch of TVL sitting on something that's not decentralized. But that's kind of. Yeah, and you know, I think they're in general, we'll see some of these use cases start to come alive, but also interested to kind of see, you know, how all the other ecosystems take off.
00:22:11.204 - 00:22:50.050, Speaker A: Definitely, definitely excited about all the work again that you guys have been doing, kind of how it's been manifesting, and excited that individual teams are building out on their own individual subnets and kind of continue to experiment as well as the in house stuff that you're doing with working with the PhDs and trying to establish those core primitives, maybe going a little bit deeper into that. What kind of core primitives are you really excited about bringing into the avalanche ecosystem or a open call to builders that you would love to have built on the network?
00:22:51.550 - 00:23:45.136, Speaker B: Oh man, great question. On the DeFi side, we're seeing a lot of innovation still on the DeX in particular. I think a lot of people think it ends with uni V three in a lot of ways. In my opinion, that's really where it begins because there is so much more we can do to optimize with respect to custom market making. Strategies that go a little bit more in depth, making it much more composable, allowing for different types of assets to be traded, allowing for strategies to strategies within market making to also include options, embedded strategies. So there's a lot of people working on these things that are incredibly sophisticated and I'm super excited to be spending, you know, I would say a large part of my days with them. We try to handhold as much as possible and work very closely with the projects in our ecosystem.
00:23:45.136 - 00:24:20.472, Speaker B: I think it provides us a unique advantage as it relates to the one thing that I think applications want the most, which is love. And so we try to provide that. You know, a lot of times I always tell people that, you know, our money is the same as another blockchain's money. So I have no intention, you know, we have no intention of winning on that front. But, you know, where I think we can win is on the tech and also on how we, you know, work as closely with projects. But where I would. My open call to builders is I think the social, the social landscape is completely underdeveloped with respect to blockchains.
00:24:20.472 - 00:25:23.210, Speaker B: I think, you know, I'm really excited about like what lens has been doing for the Aave guys. I think that's a perfect segue into kind of an interesting way to build applications. But I don't know. For the very first time that Ethereum was deployed, I always thought that social applications would be really interesting. On the blockchain a little bit of a, I don't think a well known part of my life, but in like 2017 and 18, I was actually working on a blockchain based social applications, which I founded. So I have a lot of experience in the social rabbit holes as it may be in terms of building applications. I think building these really interesting communities that take a lot of the concepts like user incentives, liquidity, mining, all these different things that we've used to gain adoption and build networks really fast and moving that and putting that towards social, in my opinion, is like super powerful.
00:25:23.210 - 00:25:31.606, Speaker B: And I think a vast improvement in a tam that is just enormous. Like tam in terms of total addressable market.
00:25:31.718 - 00:26:17.630, Speaker A: I totally agree. Yeah. I'm personally excited for anything that will accelerate the user adoption and kind of even I would like to see like more people that understand private key management and that be able to sign transactions on a blockchain and not just hold crypto. And I think the social thing is fascinating in the fact that, I mean, that is probably the biggest user base out there today in kind of the web two world. And if we can kind of continue to hack away and add some of the web, three elements of owning your data and all kind of the interactions bring those kind of forward and kind of a clean user interface, what that ultimately would amount to. So if someone could build that, it'd be very cool.
00:26:18.570 - 00:26:57.476, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I would love to see more of this. I know there's been like some attempts at, you know, like music, nfts and all these kind of things, but, you know, until we can provide a product that is superior to web two, we shouldn't expect to have any adoption, in my opinion. Right. People aren't like, people aren't going to come just to own their data like the people that came for that already. Like, you know, we sort of squeezed that sponge, I think, you know, in order to get the people who care less about that, we need to build applications that are superior to them. What exists, and the one trade off being that you own your own data, I don't think is going to be enough. Right.
00:26:57.476 - 00:27:26.994, Speaker B: We need to legitimately build better applications. Whether it's from a UX perspective, value proposition, product market fit, a new innovation in a product that didn't previously exist. This is what the social applications I did all the shared economy applications, I think really pushed mobile and the Internet forward with respect to web two, because they were things we didn't have before. And until we could provide those, I think we're sort of in this building stage.
00:27:27.162 - 00:27:44.148, Speaker A: I fully agree, but excited that it's continuing to get built, continue to be being built out, and the fact that it is kind of more of bear market now. People have a little room to breathe, kind of think about what they're actually building and think about the user applications as well.
00:27:44.244 - 00:27:46.492, Speaker B: Yeah, there's less chasing, less noise, which.
00:27:46.516 - 00:28:19.590, Speaker A: Is nice for sure. One thing that kind of outside of gaming and defi that I also wanted to talk about was more along kind of some of your hackathons that you guys are starting to spin up. I think hackathons more broadly is kind of one of the best ways to bootstrap any ecosystem. And it's been exciting for me personally just to go to a few of them. Could you talk about kind of some of the initiatives there and what you've been kind of seeing happen at these hacker houses?
00:28:20.410 - 00:29:11.118, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So hackathons in general, like, we had one in at the Barcelona summit at the end of it, we had one in Turkey, another one, two in Turkey, I believe, and a few virtual ones as well. So I think hackathons are really good way to get people to the top of the funnel in terms of building an application. I don't think it allows them to go deep enough. And from that perspective, I think hackathons are only so interesting with respect to building a developer ecosystem. A lot of times at these hackathons, you get professional hackers which have like, excuse me, they have like stickers from like 14 ETH hackathons, 30 Solana hackathons, 20 avalanche hackathons, etcetera, etcetera. So they're there to win prizes, which is fine, but what they end up building in two to three days isn't usually production ready.
00:29:11.118 - 00:29:43.596, Speaker B: So from like a practical standpoint, I think hackathons are interesting, but only so effective. What we are launching is something called Avalanche Creates, which is sort of a play on a Y combinator slash hack house. The first one going live at the, I think next week in the Bay Area. So if anybody's in that area interested, they should totally like, just go there. It's going to be cool. We'll have many members of the team. I think there will be some members from leadership who's going to be there, and also community builders are going to be there.
00:29:43.596 - 00:30:32.398, Speaker B: There'll be demos, there'll be ways to learn on subnets. There'll also be, I think, a pitch day at the end so people can get funding from investors to pitch what they built. So we're excited to bring this concept like this will be our, I think, beta version. So this will be our first, like first one going live, and then we'll sort of go around the world with it. And I think that will allow for us to meet new builders across the ecosystem, across the world. And one thing I always tell people is you have to do things that don't scale before you can do things that do scale. And this is like a very intimate way in a bear market, I think, to just meet with people who are interested in building web3 applications and whether they're college students, whether they're former web two devs, whether actual sophisticated web3 devs.
00:30:32.398 - 00:30:37.878, Speaker B: This is a way for them to interface with us, with our community and learn and build together.
00:30:38.014 - 00:30:42.970, Speaker A: That's awesome. Are there official dates for that yet?
00:30:43.910 - 00:30:50.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's next week. Yeah, it's next week. Uh, today, 17. So next week. Yeah.
00:30:50.908 - 00:31:00.916, Speaker A: Very cool. Now, uh, I. I've kind of been a fan of, uh, just being able to go to some of these different events and kind of see the different things that people are building.
00:31:01.068 - 00:31:23.610, Speaker B: Uh, yeah, I think being approachable is important. Right. So sometimes hackathon, I think, could be intimidating in a lot of ways. Like this, you know, sleep all night thing. I mean, like, no sleeping, like cold forever, like maybe win a prize. But I don't know. I think they're very effective at bringing people in and introducing yourself, but they don't allow for you to go super deep.
00:31:23.610 - 00:31:26.830, Speaker B: And I think that's the void we want to fill, especially now.
00:31:26.950 - 00:32:07.620, Speaker A: Nice. Yeah. Looking forward to that event and other future events. I know a lot of people do kind of use those as excuse to travel and see different places as well. And so excited to kind of see ultimately what other locations you guys open up after kind of learning the ins and outs of the first one, which is very cool. Yeah, I guess just kind of touching upon, I mean, outside of gaming in Defi, what other kind of interesting things have you been kind of following along in the overall avalanche ecosystem?
00:32:08.570 - 00:33:01.750, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think it sort of goes hand in hand with our defi efforts. So I don't think it's like, you know, sort of. I think it's sort of like along the same veins, but our institutional efforts are strong, have been strong. And I think while not sexy to maybe the crypto crowd is like a potentially game changing sort of endeavor. So what I mean by institution is defi, to me is the way we talk about it a lot today is really interesting because it's fun and you sort of had this way to kind of custody your own assets and be able to trade them and earn yield on them, et cetera. But to me this is very much the beginning of altering the financial market infrastructure.
00:33:01.750 - 00:34:14.038, Speaker B: So when I sat at a seat, I started an operations at Citigroup. And until you sit, I think in a seat where you're working in operations at a large bank and understand how all these things work, it's very hard to really understand how exciting crypto is. One of the very obvious use cases for crypto is not sexy, but enables incredible operational efficiencies within finance. And what I mean by that is like they're still sending paper confirms for derivatives transactions. A lot of times like I would have trades that, you know, when the first floating rate payment would go out six months later the desk would find out that the trade was backwards. Right? This is crazy, right? You would never imagine this to be real, but when you're settling things with paper and mail and faxes, like what do you expect? So I still think that, you know, and I, and I firmly believe that building a, that the financial market infrastructure today could never get to something like atomic settlement, transparent execution on its own. Right.
00:34:14.038 - 00:34:59.210, Speaker B: It's never going to happen. Like we were still using computers, computer computer systems from the 1970s when I was there. So to upgrade we were building a trade capture system for 15 years. And I checked in with somebody recently, it's still not done. So from that standpoint, it's very hard to change things from within. And so what I think DeFi will provide are the new Lego blocks and effectively infrastructure to set up the new financial market exchanges to set up the new options exchanges to effectively still provide a place for banks to have a place. However, do it from the standpoint of additional transparency, do it from the standpoint of fast settlement.
00:34:59.210 - 00:35:05.438, Speaker B: So if anybody's still writing checks in five years, then we fail in my opinion.
00:35:05.534 - 00:35:32.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I do agree. Having a lot of these blockchains, there's the social layer and then all, which is largely kind of formed through nfts and then also the financial infrastructure. And I think both of those, I mean, are super hard to bootstrap. But if you can figure out each of those, then you're really kind of cooking and yeah, it's the financial thing definitely has to be awesome as well.
00:35:32.940 - 00:36:17.430, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I mentioned before we recently announced with KKR like the $450 billion fund that they are know, launching one of their, a piece of their fund on avalanche chain, the blockchain, in partnership with securitize for qualified purchasers. What that allows for is people to actually buy access to the fund on chain, which is super interesting. Allows for a lot of operational efficiencies and paperwork to be removed. And, you know, that's the first step. Right. And if they see value in it, I think there's a reason, and we're going to continue to see a lot of interesting things also. Like, this is something that gets people a lot of hate in the space, especially in my seat.
00:36:17.430 - 00:36:44.352, Speaker B: But I think having a Defi infrastructure that includes KYC in a lot of ways will bring a lot of institutions into the space that aren't currently in the space. And I think avalanche sits in a really unique spot to deliver that and something that we're obviously very interested in. So if you do that, you remove a lot of the KYC and AML hesitancy that many institutions have, especially us based ones.
00:36:44.496 - 00:36:55.900, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And being able to spin up your own subnet and have a KYC subnet on that infrastructure that avalanche has provided makes that relatively straightforward as well.
00:36:57.200 - 00:36:59.380, Speaker B: Exactly. More to come.
00:36:59.500 - 00:37:38.070, Speaker A: Nice. Awesome. No very cool updates. Maybe kind of touching upon even a little bit more high level is sometimes avalanches compared to, say, like, cosmos and, like, kind of what they're doing there. I know we're not going to get too much into technicals. Uh, but on kind of the different fronts, what do you kind of see as, like, the main reasons or kind of your pitch to or main differentiators from Cosmo to kind of avalanche?
00:37:39.130 - 00:37:55.878, Speaker B: Yeah. Cosmos is a really strong project. Been a fan of Cosmos since it came out. Really. I met J. Kwan at some. At some event back in 2016, and he was telling me the whole story about tendermint.
00:37:55.878 - 00:38:21.638, Speaker B: We came up with the name for it by essentially brute forcing names into just find something that worked. And so, yeah, I always thought it made sense to me. Right. I think that where avalanche is different than Cosmos is number one on the consensus layer. Right. They use sort of a different consensus mechanism than avalanche. Right.
00:38:21.638 - 00:39:02.258, Speaker B: It really is more like classical consensus in the sense that it only scales to 100 to 150 validators or so. Avalanche, yeah, avalanche consensus is very different. Obviously, right now, in the primary network, there's 1400 with subsecond finality. So it proves that it scales a little bit further than that or much further than that. So I think from the consensus mechanism, totally different. Even architecture is pretty different in the sense that cosmos are completely isolated chains. I know there, in some respects, it seems to be not moving away from that, but maybe moving a little bit towards more connectivity between those chains.
00:39:02.258 - 00:39:59.856, Speaker B: But avalanche is different in the sense that we have this p chain architecture that stores the full validator set. And so when we do, and I know Patrick mentioned this in some ways, but when we do have cross subnet communication which is actively in development, that will make probably the overhead of that communication a lot lower just because of, by virtue of how it's architected and how all the validators are stored in that set. So I think from that standpoint, we also have a completely different approach. And then on the EVM side, I think Avalanche has done a lot of work to integrate the EVM with Avalanche. And I know Cosmos has evmos right now, but I know that's been less of a focus for them since the beginning. So I think we also have a really unique sort of value proposition as it relates to spinning up your own EVM base chain.
00:40:00.008 - 00:40:22.580, Speaker A: Definitely. That makes perfect sense. Kind of appreciate you walking us through that. Maybe kind of jumping into some of the community questions that are live on the chat. One person was asking about if there was any updates from the avalabs side on the core wallet and the development efforts there.
00:40:23.560 - 00:40:49.552, Speaker B: Great question. Yeah, so the core wallet is an avalabs product. It is very much one that has spun up with the intention of iterating and getting community feedback in this market. I think it's done a few things incredibly well. Number one, it has allowed for, I think it's much faster to execute transactions than metamask. Number one, because of the way it does polling on the avalanche blockchain. Right.
00:40:49.552 - 00:41:36.000, Speaker B: So I mean, what's interesting about building a wallet unique to one chain is that you can sort of really integrate the whole experience. And I think the vision is for. Yeah, and so the vision is for if subnets are something that is going to take off from an infrastructure perspective, ensuring that the front end is incredibly seamless as it relates to going from different subnets is incredibly important. And I think the thesis and the hope for that is that waiting and relying on other people for key infrastructure components is a tough way to build a network. I think that's a mistake a lot of people have made. So, for example, RPCs are a great example. Right.
00:41:36.000 - 00:42:25.348, Speaker B: Avalabs runs public rpcs for the Avalanche network. We've taken a very proactive approach to building our own rpcs and not relying on third party providers. While there are 30 party providers who are now here like inferior quicknode and others who are doing a great job in bootstrapping the ecosystem, I think the fact that we did that allowed for the RPC allow for the lack of RPC issues that many chains have experienced so far? Because we were the ones who are dedicated to it, constantly monitoring it, and obviously care the most about it, where a third party, sometimes they just integrate you and set and forget it. Same thing for the wallet. We don't want to be an afterthought. We want the front end to be a completely integrated experience that allows for, I think, something special.
00:42:25.524 - 00:43:06.574, Speaker A: Definitely. It's awesome to hear kind of the quality and depth that you guys have put into kind of creating the wallet experience and the unique things that are enabled by specifically tailoring the wallet to avalanche in the ecosystem. Maybe going down a little bit more into some of the customer or live chat questions. One person said as a builder, they're having a hard time kind of with like the regulatory framework. What is kind of your recommendations? I know this is more of a tricky question. I don't know, we can maybe pass on this seems like, I mean, I.
00:43:06.582 - 00:43:11.430, Speaker B: Could just say like, I could just say like, because, I mean, I talk like, my job is to talk to builders all day.
00:43:11.470 - 00:43:11.838, Speaker A: Right.
00:43:11.934 - 00:43:44.410, Speaker B: These are questions that I normally get anyway. Yeah, I don't, I'm not going to give legal advice. This is obviously a very volatile and ever changing regulatory environment. What I would say is to take the extra precautions, make sure to seek legal counsel and play it safe, especially in this market as it relates to regulatory concerns. I think that goes without saying. But we also talked about some of the things subnets can do with respect to alleviating some of the other issues, with respect to tokens.
00:43:44.740 - 00:43:59.680, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes sense. It is complicated. I think. I do hope the US and more broadly, there's kind of a global framework that we can all kind of use because it does make it a little challenging on the builder side.
00:44:00.220 - 00:44:51.566, Speaker B: This is the thing, if we want to be honest with ourselves, crypto in a lot of ways is regulatory arbitrage. I think it's, at its core, a lot of what's happening is people sort of rebelling against certain rules that have been around for a long time and by virtue of what they're building, essentially saying like, these are antiquated, outdated and no longer apply to the things that we're building. We want to change. Like, I think that's what the message is. And so we very much are straddling a very complicated rule set, one which is like, hey, build things that fit within the existing frameworks which we can do, are doing, are less innovative and interesting in some ways. And then in other ways, it's like, hey, build things that are somewhat gray. Right? And by the way, I'm not telling you to directly do this.
00:44:51.566 - 00:45:08.706, Speaker B: Don't blame me, whatever. But like, I think this is what's happening, right? Build things that are somewhat gray. And if the world actually is very interested in them and it gets excited by them, I think law is just generally lagging indicators of that in a lot of ways. At least we've seen that in the past.
00:45:08.818 - 00:45:24.430, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. It is a fine line to be walking, but it's because it is a fine line. There's a lot of opportunity in kind of that gray space, but definitely interested to see how it will continue to play out.
00:45:24.730 - 00:45:34.236, Speaker B: The Uber examples, like the one that everybody talks about, right? Like, you know, if they were to follow the rules, they probably would have never actually gotten to a place where they got mass adoption.
00:45:34.388 - 00:46:23.730, Speaker A: I definitely agree. Yeah, Uber was definitely an interesting case. Along with Airbnb, lots of different examples of the regulatory arbitrage. Cool. I'm very, just fascinated watching the avalanche ecosystem, excited by all the updates you've been pushing and the team has been pushing in, very excited just to watch the social layer continue to develop. The avalanche team is very active on Twitter. What is your kind of advice for people to get in contact? Is it through or like, maybe not even get in contact, but just stay up with the ecosystem? Is it through podcasts or Twitter? What's your kind of recommendation on all things avalanche?
00:46:24.870 - 00:47:07.340, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we are pretty active, I think for all my italian friends out there, Twitter in a lot of ways. La Piazza. And so I think it's a good place to kind of hear what's going on, whether it's myself, Emin, Kevin, the main accounts, we generally do our best to keep the community abreast of what's going on. It's a good place to follow all of us. Emin has an all access podcast that he does weekly. And for those of you who don't know, Eman is Emin Gunsir, who's the founder of Avalanche. So that's a great way to catch up on if you missed anything, what's going on, what's on his mind, et cetera.
00:47:07.340 - 00:47:26.680, Speaker B: And then in general, like, I think we'll be rolling out some interesting podcasts on our own as well. So I think that'll be kind of unique. Yeah. And try to get more content out there and, and, yeah. So if anybody ever wants to get in contact with me, I keep my DM's open. Still haven't. Still don't know why, frankly, but I do.
00:47:26.680 - 00:47:35.880, Speaker B: And I do, like, I do get a lot of, actually, I've found some really, really good builders that were cold DM's. I have to say, it's like fascinating.
00:47:36.460 - 00:48:31.100, Speaker A: Yeah, no, the DM's, I always leave my DM's open and my account's not as big as, so I'm sure you get some interesting ones, but a good directed cold email can actually, or DM can take you very far. And so definitely if you're interested in learning about Avax, don't hesitate to reach out. But cool. No, I really appreciate your time and just kind of be able to kind of catch up on the general state of the ecosystem on avalanche. Definitely have kind of covered a lot of the technical deep dives, but it's good just to kind of hear on the builder side and the community side what's kind of going in the ecosystem and as they're developing, is there anything that you kind of want to touch upon on a high level that we kind of left out or any shout outs or anything?
00:48:35.610 - 00:49:22.500, Speaker B: I think we covered a lot of what I wanted to cover. What I would say is for whoever was not at the last avalanche summit last year, there'll be another one and it'll be announced at some point and you should definitely make sure you're there. I think it was a great event and I think the avalanche community is sort of its own identity at this point. And that's something that gives me, you know, a ton of joy as it relates to this space. It's really developed into something more collegial, I think. And in a lot of ways, you know, I think we have a lot of ways to go. But in the bear market in particular, I remember very well, like 2018 and 2019, and this space is pretty lonely.
00:49:22.500 - 00:49:33.504, Speaker B: So it's pretty exciting to kind of see that there's still a lot of people engaged in the space and kind of want to see it go forward, and I'm just happy to be a part of that.
00:49:33.632 - 00:49:49.848, Speaker A: Yeah, I would definitely echo those sentiments. I was class of 2017 and it was definitely a roller coaster in that 2018 time period. And so glad now that there's actually usable applications and builders that are building.
00:49:49.984 - 00:50:13.452, Speaker B: That's what I always say. Yeah, everybody forgets that we had nothing to do in 18 or 19. It was either go trade on binance or nothing. Now, like, you know, there still is Defi NFTs. There's things being built. I mean, even worse than that. In 2012, I first, I bought my first bitcoin on the trading desk and thought I was a genius because it like ten x immediately.
00:50:13.516 - 00:50:14.060, Speaker A: Yep.
00:50:14.180 - 00:50:34.230, Speaker B: I tell people. I tell people this story all the time and I sold it because Apple announced their apple Pay and I was like, oh, man. Like electronic cash. Like this thing's so hard to use and so slow. Why would anybody use this? Completely missed everything, which is great. But you know, it's interesting. Like now we actually have things to do which is like the first bear market.
00:50:34.230 - 00:50:39.070, Speaker B: And that just shows you, like, wow, it's pretty, it is pretty early in this space.
00:50:39.150 - 00:51:03.482, Speaker A: It's extremely early. And especially just using looking at kind of the user adoption metric or active wallets. I'm happy that like ten people in crypto, it's not very many. It's definitely compared to web two. But it is nice that we actually have applications, we have our jpegs and we can kind of rally around those different communities, which has been fun. So.
00:51:03.506 - 00:51:14.830, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah, I mean, I still wake up and I feed my digital chickens, which to me is like hilarious. Yeah, it's hilarious. But yeah, it's a necessity.
00:51:15.290 - 00:51:49.380, Speaker A: Cool. Typically in this podcast, I try to on like spicy takes, just rouse some people up and I be able to clip it and get it to the timeline so we can rack up the views on kind of spicy takes. What are like an ecosystem outside of avalanche that you have thought like, has done stuff uniquely well and then what is kind of an ecosystem that you think is just kind of doing things bad? Maybe you could even talk more about L2s.
00:51:50.500 - 00:52:28.014, Speaker B: Oh boy. Who's done something well. So I would say that Cosmos has done a lot of things well with respect to, like, there's some really good builders there. They've been building app chains and sort of focused on that in a lot of ways. And they've been doing it for a long time. And I would say like, I really admire their ability to stick to their vision for a long time and continue to iterate upon it. Like, to me that's just been interesting and also like to throw further phrase, it's like ethereum as well.
00:52:28.014 - 00:53:01.192, Speaker B: I was just at Devcon, like, there's still a very inclusive ecosystem. Nobody trying to light my avalanche sweatshirt on fire or anything like that. Also that community is really good in terms of who's bad. I don't know if I want to, for lack of a better word, shit on. Shit on like one ecosystem or not. I would just say like, generally speaking, crypto in a lot of ways is a copycat game. And we've seen a lot of people take playbooks, you know, and sort of like reuse them.
00:53:01.192 - 00:53:25.706, Speaker B: I think if you're taking the playbook after the 7th time that it's been done and trying to do it, I think like at that point you know, you're not going to get much just, you know, you're not going to get much juice out of your squeeze. So we've sort of seen that more recently and you know, I think the impact of those things haven't really been super effective and you know I think that was pretty obvious if you would ask me beforehand.
00:53:25.818 - 00:53:49.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Cool. Well we can wrap it up there. Thank you again Luigi. Really appreciate your time. Appreciate all your takes, the spicy takes and all the updates on the ecosystem from the builder side on the hacker houses and yeah just cool to continue to watch the avalanche ecosystem develop and follow along with progress.
00:53:50.120 - 00:53:54.208, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks Logan. This was really fun and look forward to doing again sometime.
00:53:54.384 - 00:53:54.800, Speaker A: Will do.
