00:00:00.120 - 00:00:19.942, Speaker A: It's a pretty simple idea. It did not take us all that long to think about it. It came together in a couple of days where it's like, oh, why doesn't it work like this? Yeah, that works. Okay, let's do that. It was pretty simple, but definitely the scale that pith operates at today just would not have been possible if we hadn't come up with this full model.
00:00:20.086 - 00:01:07.340, Speaker B: It's fascinating to me just watching the underlying technical stacks shift from these earlier networks being much lower throughput, have longer block times, longer finalities to these much higher throughput ecosystems that have much lower latency. And when you do that, you also have to upgrade everything else in the tech stack to make it also high throughput and low latency, like oracles. And I think we're going through that entire process. And then once you do that, what type of unique applications can leverage all those components? J H. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Looking forward to it. I think what Duro Labs has been building with pith is super exciting, exciting time for the company with the airdrop that you guys recently did.
00:01:07.340 - 00:01:20.700, Speaker B: Just tremendous progress, and I think ultimately what pith enables is just really new, interesting applications. Really excited to have you on. Excited to dive into all of it.
00:01:21.480 - 00:01:24.340, Speaker A: Thank you so much for having me, Logan. I'm looking forward to the conversation.
00:01:25.660 - 00:01:50.964, Speaker B: Yeah, I would love to just get a quick pulse check on how things are internally at Duralabs. You recently did the Airdrop, and I think anytime any company does an airdrop, there's lots of excitement, not only internally, but externally as well. If you could just give us a sneak peek behind the windows internally and how that is your viewing it, I'd love to hear it.
00:01:51.012 - 00:02:12.168, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, for sure. I mean, people are excited about it. We did the airdrop. We listed the tokenization about two weeks ago, and that's a big milestone for any project. It's kind of like the beginning of decentralized governance and all these kinds of things. So it's really exciting in that perspective. And it's obviously something that the team has been working on for a long time.
00:02:12.168 - 00:02:30.160, Speaker A: And so whenever you get one of those milestones, I think people are going to get jazzed up, and I think things really went quite well. You've seen airdrops where there's a lot of fud on crypto Twitter or whatever, and it seems like everything went really smoothly, so really couldn't be happier.
00:02:30.580 - 00:02:44.640, Speaker B: That is amazing. Yeah, the crypto Twitter is a funny place. I think sometimes it affects real life. And sometimes it's a over amplification of really dumb things. So it's hard to parse that apart sometimes, for sure.
00:02:44.940 - 00:02:55.336, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it is. It's like, sometimes there's really smart takes on there, but sometimes it's just fud. It's just like, random guy saying something and someone amplifying.
00:02:55.508 - 00:03:16.980, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Maybe before, like, diving into the tech stack of what Dura Labs has built with pith, can you share a little bit more about just, like, your background, how you got into the crypto industry and how you actually ended up building one of the more interesting technologies within the cryptosphere?
00:03:17.280 - 00:03:39.832, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So, you know, my background is I actually have a PhD in machine learning and natural language processing. So I used to work on kind of, like, dialogue models, I guess, before they were cool. And so that's kind of my traditional background. And I've been working that for a number of years. I was at a startup, we got acquired by Microsoft, kind of did the whole thing. But I've always been interested in crypto.
00:03:39.832 - 00:04:11.470, Speaker A: I've been interested in crypto since 2014 or so. That's when I first got into it, because it's actually kind of a funny story. Like, there was this Carnegie Mellon professor who I was at Carnegie Mellon, I was doing my PhD, and there's this rumor that he'd made a bunch of money in cryptocurrency. And we didn't really know what he did, but people were interested, and your grad students, some extra beer money would be nice. We got interested. We started thinking, what can we do in cryptocurrency? This is interesting. I thought about it, and I was like, you know what? I can do some programmatic trading.
00:04:11.470 - 00:04:31.060, Speaker A: I sat down and I built a programmatic trading system for cryptocurrencies back in 2014. This was super early days. This is before Coinbase had an exchange. Like, I remember when the Coinbase exchange launched, and I was like, oh, cool, like, this is awesome. So it was pretty early days. It wasn't very competitive back then. So I did reasonably well.
00:04:31.060 - 00:05:06.210, Speaker A: So I ran that for a few years, shut it down around 2018 when the pros started playing. But I've been interested in the space ever since. I've been following along, following the technology and things like that. And I was really interested in Ethereum, the promise of building these applications that run on the blockchain. But the whole time I was in it, like, it always felt like vaporware. I mean, people never really were building these apps, right? And then. So in 2020, someone showed me compound and I was like, oh, wait, this is a real application running on the blockchain that does a useful thing.
00:05:06.210 - 00:05:27.570, Speaker A: And I was like, okay, like, this is really interesting. Like, now's the time to get involved. And so I was kind of looking around for what to do. A friend of mine from college actually worked at Jump and he just joined the crypto division. He was like, you got to come check this out. This is crazy. So I was interested, I threw my hat in the ring, I got a job, and it was crazy.
00:05:27.570 - 00:05:40.950, Speaker A: It's bull market. Everyone's running around, everything's on fire. But I sat down, I started doing some research, developing some of the mechanisms behind Pip, and that evolved to where I am today.
00:05:41.330 - 00:06:03.740, Speaker B: That's amazing. Maybe in terms of framing the conversation a little bit, just in terms of what were some of the things either from jump or either trading that you learned from, like, high frequency standpoint that didn't really map too well to blockchains and ultimately maybe created the, like, genesis or the birth for pith.
00:06:04.880 - 00:06:51.166, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So, you know, one of the things that, there's actually a couple different things that, you know, as someone who's kind of deeply versed in financial markets, that didn't really make sense when we looked at Oracles and how they're designed back in the day. And a couple of things those things are, first of all, that financial market data is really valuable. So the big exchanges make billions of dollars a year on market data and all the hedge funds and things like that are basically paying subscription fees to these exchanges. If you looked at how Oracles were built back in the day, they assumed that all data was free. It's like, look, we're going to build a system that goes and it scrapes the web and it gets the price from three different websites and it posts that on the blockchain. And I get why people build a system like that.
00:06:51.166 - 00:07:17.232, Speaker A: From an engineering perspective, it is elegant and it's a simple solution to the problem. But we looked at that and we realized this just isn't going to work. This data is valuable. You need to have a way to actually compensate the owners of that data for providing it. That was one of the key insights that led to the design of PIP. Another insight was just that real time data is important. You need data to be fast and low latency.
00:07:17.232 - 00:07:52.570, Speaker A: High frequency. Low latency is really important in trading and basically any financial application oracles on the blockchain were updating at a frequency of 1 hour. We knew that it just wouldn't be possible to build really interesting financial applications if your prices are delayed by an hour. Another really key emphasis for Python was basically making sure that we had high frequency, low latency prices that we knew would be required. Right. I mean, like, part of this was just, we wanted to do something that would be good for the ecosystem, and we knew that, like, the ecosystem wouldn't be able to develop these cool applications without those. That kind of data quality.
00:07:53.150 - 00:08:26.570, Speaker B: Yeah. It is remarkable how valuable data has actually become, whether it's an AI or on the blockchain. I think people used to sell their data for a couple cents, and now they're a little bit more protective about it. And I think people, and perhaps the pit team, realized that very early on, especially being on the market side and doing high frequency trading, that data is extremely valuable and needs to make sure that it's compensated correctly for that data.
00:08:27.190 - 00:08:53.600, Speaker A: Yeah, it's totally true. And this is why we built pith with the first party data model, where I. All the people who own the data are actually the people who publish the data to pith. So they're directly connected to pith. They're providing the data, they own it, so they're allowed to do that. And then the pith mechanisms are supposed to reward them for doing so. So there's actually a sort of an economic incentive to doing it right, as opposed to it just being free.
00:08:53.900 - 00:09:15.980, Speaker B: Yeah. In terms of pith's unique angle in this compared to other industry practices, can you maybe dive a little bit deeper into how Pith decided to partner with these publishers versus the legacy model of how people are bringing data?
00:09:19.000 - 00:09:51.150, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so, as I said, we knew that we'd have to basically compensate the owners of the data. Right. We knew that would be important in any sort of long term oracle project success. We were at jump, and basically we just started having some conversations, and this is not my wheelhouse. I'm the technical guy. We have great salespeople who do a lot of these conversations. I can't tell you exactly how they went, but they reached out to some other financial firms, some other trading firms, and a lot of them were actually interested in doing this.
00:09:51.150 - 00:10:48.500, Speaker A: We got a few on board, and it's snowballed from there. What I can say about this is that there's a couple of different things that I know, at least, that those kinds of traditional finance firms and stuff have found interesting about the process, which is that there's actually a lot of curiosity, I think, in that space about crypto, and people are kind of looking for ways to get involved, but it can be hard for them, their regulatory barriers, things like that. Pith was actually a very easy way for them to get their foot in the door. And I build some experience on the team with crypto, setting up a wallet, custody, all these kinds of things, which are new. I think that was actually an angle that a lot of people found compelling. The other one is that there are actually financial firms who have data who are not currently monetizing it. A lot of trading firms have very accurate pricing for the price of assets because they trade them multiple times a second.
00:10:48.500 - 00:10:57.700, Speaker A: They know what the price is, but they're currently not monetizing that data. And so pith actually gives them a way to monetize that, which is interesting for them. Right. It's like found money.
00:10:58.120 - 00:11:25.920, Speaker B: Yeah, both of those are fascinating, I think. To your point, blockchain has either been scary or there's not been a good financial reason to actually dip your toes in the water, even though you're intellectually curious. And by allowing that solution of one to incentivize parties to be more willing to share that data and to get a small window into what the next iteration of finance technology looks like, it's a compelling pitch.
00:11:26.780 - 00:11:50.740, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been pretty successful. We've had pretty dramatic growth in data providers. We have a lot of big name traditional finance firms on board. We have a lot of the big crypto exchanges trading firms onboard as well. We've been adding a couple of publishers a month, something like that, for the whole time we've been around. It's been a. Been a pretty compelling pitch, I guess.
00:11:50.780 - 00:12:12.880, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Very impressive nonetheless. Maybe shifting more from, like, the marketing side to the technical side. That latter aspect that you mentioned of making sure that the data is fresh, real time, as low latency as possible. We'd love to kind of parse apart that and how the dura labs team created that within the PIP network.
00:12:13.820 - 00:12:34.144, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So that's a great question. And, you know, we had this goal, basically, of having low latency, high frequency prices. And at the time, what we thought was, okay, what we're going to do is we're going to build Pyth on basically the fastest blockchain that we can find, because the fastest blockchain is going to give you the best latency and frequency. That was Solana. So we built pith on Solana.
00:12:34.144 - 00:13:25.382, Speaker A: We launched our initial version on Solana, quickly grew to basically have the entire Solana market, most of the Solana market. I don't remember the stat offhand, but pretty much all the major protocols on Solana use Pip today. And so that was kind of our first big success as a project. But we knew that even when we were starting the project that it wouldn't be enough to just kind of be on one blockchain. Right. Because the state of the world, I mean, especially if you look at it today, the state of the world is there's so many different blockchains out there, there's so many different technologies, it's really not clear how this is going to play out. Right? Like, are we going to live on EVM roll ups, or are we going to live on these monolithic blockchains like Solana, or maybe like aptos? Like, who knows? It could be the case that there are different choices that make sense for different applications, maybe.
00:13:25.382 - 00:14:04.836, Speaker A: It's really nice to have move if you're building x and you want to do something else for y. So you could see this playing out a bunch of different ways. And as an oracle, we thought, the important thing is we want the data to be available for developers wherever they're building. It doesn't make sense to just build it on Solana and only serve the Solana developers. You want everyone to have the data. So we had this goal even from the beginning of expanding out to other blockchains. We recently, maybe not recently, maybe about a year ago, took the step to do that, where we designed this new pithnet blockchain with this pull architecture that's allowed us to be really, really scalable to lots of chains.
00:14:04.836 - 00:14:14.290, Speaker A: Python, 40 something blockchains today, it's a number that's growing all the time and powering apps across them. So it's been pretty great.
00:14:14.830 - 00:14:49.300, Speaker B: Yeah, it is rather remarkable. I mean, supporting 40 different architectures is no easy feat. And one thing that you mentioned was really that kind of caught my eye was that pull model. From the technical standpoint, I think pith was the first to do so, or one of the early kind of pioneers of this model. Can you compare the pull model to what was happening traditionally in these oracle architectures and why the pull model is much better?
00:14:49.760 - 00:15:41.216, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe to take you back in time, we made this decision to create this pull model about a year ago, and the reason that we did it was because we had this desire to go to other blockchains and we thought about the economics. So the way other oracles worked at the time is they're what we call push oracles now, which is they would basically have some off chain service that periodically updates the on chain price, right? So it sends a transaction, pay some gas, updates the on chain price. And we were actually thinking about doing that. We were like, okay, great, we do that on Solana, let's do that everywhere else. And, but we started thinking about it deeply and we realized that the economics of this just like did not make sense because when you're running a push oracle, every single time you update the price, you pay some gas fee to do that, right? And this actually for the normies that.
00:15:41.328 - 00:15:49.500, Speaker B: Don'T understand what push means, that's just publishing the transaction to the chain regardless of anybody requesting that information, correct?
00:15:49.800 - 00:16:39.294, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. That's right. Basically the oracle is running a service which every ten minutes is going to submit a transaction, right? You submit a transaction, you pay captain, something like that. And so, okay, so the problem with this was like we realized like, look, what do people want from an oracle? You know, they want lots of price feeds, right? They want lots of different assets so that whatever asset they want is one of them, right? They want lots of updates per second. You know, they want it to be updated high frequency, right? They want, they want, they want it on lots of blockchains, right? I mean they don't really necessarily want on lots of blockchains, but they want it on their blockchain for sure. All of these product attributes, if you think about operating the push oracle, every single one of those costs you money. Every time you list a price feed, suddenly you're paying more to operate this thing all the time.
00:16:39.294 - 00:17:13.900, Speaker A: If you want to do more updates per second, suddenly you're paying more and you want to do more chains, you're paying more. If you actually look at the offerings of these push oracles, they're very fragmented. It's like, look, we've got 100 feeds on Ethereum, but we've got eight feeds on avalanche, something like that. The reason for that is fundamentally that every single one of these feeds is an operating cost. And it's a hard decision for them to say yes and add more stuff. We didn't want to be in that position. We didn't want to be out there and having to make these product compromises in order to basically make the economics make sense.
00:17:13.900 - 00:18:09.410, Speaker A: We thought about that a bit and we said, look, what if we could come up with a model that takes this operating cost and basically converts it into a fixed cost so that there's no added cost to like add a new feed or increase the updates per second or whatever? And so that's kind of where the pull model came from. And the way that the pull model works is basically PIP has a whole system which we can get into, which basically takes prices from data providers, combines them, creates this signed price payload which basically says, this is the Pip price at this time. Here's some signatures that you can verify to validate that it's authentic. Those prices are basically, they're just streaming all the time, but they're not on the blockchain. They're coming out of a decentralized system and they're just hanging around. There's a peer to peer network, you can listen to it, you can grab them. Then what we do is we say, look, if you want to use the PiP price, there's a contract on your favorite blockchain.
00:18:09.410 - 00:18:32.950, Speaker A: What that contract does is you can give it one of these payloads. It'll verify the signatures. If everything checks out, it'll say, okay, this is an official Pip price at this time and it will save it on the chain. Then you can basically read that price. The way that we envision people using this is basically, we call it the pull model, which is whenever someone actually needs a price, they go and retrieve one of these payloads. They put it on the blockchain themselves. It's a permissionless operation.
00:18:32.950 - 00:18:49.660, Speaker A: Anyone can do it. They put on the blockchain themselves and then they use it that way. Basically the oracle is not the one paying the gas. It's actually distributed to a bunch of different users who are. They're submitting transactions anyway. They're already paying gas. It's not like we're making the cost of this crazy more expensive or anything.
00:18:49.660 - 00:19:09.260, Speaker A: It basically distributes the cost to the users of the thing. And it also makes sure that nobody's paying for updates that nobody needs. We can list assets or price feeds today. If nobody uses it, it's fine. It's not like anyone's paying money for that. Whereas with the push oracle, every single one is paying for these push updates.
00:19:11.600 - 00:19:29.570, Speaker B: It seems rather simplistic on the surface, but the unlock was rather massive in terms of cost, the savings, the distributions, the engineering complexity between all the changes. It's rather remarkable how some simple things, the pole versus push, can unlock.
00:19:30.310 - 00:19:55.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's totally true. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and be like, yeah, this is some crazy, complicated idea. I mean, it's a pretty simple idea. It did not take us all that long to think about it. It came together in a couple of days where it's like, oh, why doesn't it work like this? Yeah, that works. Okay, let's do that. It was pretty simple, but definitely the scale that pith operates at today just would not have been possible if we hadn't come up with this full model.
00:19:56.520 - 00:20:10.900, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a lot of data that you can be publishing to the chain, for sure, in terms of maybe diving a little bit deeper. Can we touch upon Pitnet and some of the underlying architectures that you guys decided to do there?
00:20:11.490 - 00:20:46.710, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is kind of getting into, basically, we have the pull model, and this is kind of getting into, like, how are those price payloads that are being streamed in this peer to peer network? How are those constructed? And we wanted to do this in a decentralized way. Right. We're building a decentralized protocol. We wanted to make sure that everything that goes into the system is decentralized. That's important not just from a principles perspective, but it's also important from a reliability perspective and a security perspective, because you don't want a single entity to be able to basically manipulate the price or anything like that. The decentralization is actually core to the whole value prop of the product.
00:20:46.710 - 00:21:20.984, Speaker A: We wanted to do it in a decentralized way. What we came up with was basically, we were already running pit on Solana. Our initial proposal was something like, why don't we just keep running it on Solana and then we'll bridge the prices from there to other blockchains. But we realized that this wasn't going to work for a couple of reasons. One is just because there's this operating cost thing where again, we'd now start paying for more feeds, and that could be a problem. The other one is just, Solana has been super, super successful with a bunch of communities that are not pip. And that's great.
00:21:20.984 - 00:21:51.066, Speaker A: That's great for Solana, but the chain does get congested at times, and that's not great from the perspective of, hey, you're on Ethereum, you want to have a reliable price update from pith, but Solana is congested because someone's minting this hugely popular NFT. So tough. So that's not great. So we just wanted to come up with a system that really got us to that fixed cost thing instead of having still some variable costs. And also just go ahead.
00:21:51.138 - 00:22:33.060, Speaker B: Do you think? It was interesting when I've done a couple of podcasts with Anatoly now, and he was like, one of our biggest learnings was how the blockchain actually was used in production. And in hindsight, it probably seems obvious, similar to the pull model versus the push model, but doing localized fees that was not enabled initially within the Solana blockchain and eventually later added. And I think now the other high throughput blockchains like SWE and Aptos do similar things. Would that kind of alleviated some of those early issues that pith was experiencing?
00:22:33.360 - 00:22:52.682, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good point. And, I mean, I think it's worth it to kind of highlight the timeline on this. Right. Which is like, if you remember last summer, I mean, this is a long time ago, right. But, like, last summer was kind of where making these decisions, and it was also when these issues were, like, the most prominent on Solana. So, like, that definitely factors into your decision making at the time. Right? I mean, I think I.
00:22:52.682 - 00:23:16.290, Speaker A: Solana actually really props to them. I mean, I think they really have a really solid engineering team who's like, sat down and solved a lot of these issues and, like, things are much, much smoother now. I mean, we still have the push oracle on Solana today. And, you know, we know, right. We see all the congestion and stuff as part of that. And it really has worked a lot better since they kind of rolled out the local fee markets and stuff.
00:23:16.830 - 00:23:34.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm curious. I mean, it definitely makes sense from an engineering point of view and building out Pitnet just for the fact of supporting as many blockchains as possible, having that single network be able to do the distribution than having it on one other blockchain.
00:23:35.390 - 00:23:52.910, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Just to get back into it. Basically, we're like, okay, well, what we're going to do is we're going to set up our own blockchain. It's called Pitnet. It's a fork of Solana. So it runs the same code base, but it's a totally independent network. The data providers basically run the validators of the network.
00:23:52.910 - 00:24:21.044, Speaker A: They're already contributing data. They can just run another piece of software. Basically, we run all of the logic on that network. That takes data provider prices, combines them into the PIP aggregate price. That all happens on Pipnet. What we do from Pipnet is we basically bridge the prices to other chains using wormhole. Wormhole is this decentralized message passing protocol where it allows you to basically communicate between blockchains.
00:24:21.044 - 00:24:50.270, Speaker A: And the way it works is they have a network of, I think, 19 guardians where they basically monitor the state of the chains, and they basically sign messages that attest that the state is whatever. And so basically we have those guardians and they're basically signing messages saying, like, these are the pith prices at every point in time, taking those aggregates and creating these signed price payloads, then, yeah, that plugs into the pull model. So users can basically grab those payloads, put them permissionlessly on target chains and use them.
00:24:50.810 - 00:25:31.900, Speaker B: So maybe just to re articulate. For my knowledge, ultimately, two components of PIP network. One is that pull model that we've been discussing in length where someone can request a price. That price is already on Pithnet from a yemenite number of data providers that the pith network works with that is signed and can be verified, and then for whatever blockchain you're requesting on that then moves through wormhole, kind of a generic messaging processing bridge that will deliver the price to the end developer that requested the update.
00:25:32.200 - 00:25:33.780, Speaker A: Yep, yep, yep.
00:25:34.760 - 00:26:03.100, Speaker B: Interesting. Very interesting. I guess, like, in terms of, like, this tech stack, like, has there been any surprises? I mean, and working this, seeing how it actually works in production, I think when I talk with a lot of, like, either layer one or L2 founders, they're often surprised by the workloads that they'll see in production versus what they thought they would have seen. Any parts in your tech sack that are the pith tech stack that has kind of surprised you?
00:26:06.720 - 00:26:34.920, Speaker A: I don't know. I mean, I think we kind of knew going in, we've been running the Oracle and Solana. The Pithnet Oracle is very, very similar code base wise, so we knew how that would look. Running some of the Solana validators has been, it's a little bit of an operational challenge. They're pretty complicated to run and they need a lot of bandwidth and stuff. So there's definitely some work that people have to put in to make that work smoothly. But I think things have gone pretty.
00:26:34.920 - 00:26:55.136, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I don't think I've seen a ton of surprises there. We don't have other people coming in and computing on Pitnet. It's just us. So I think that part has been fine. I mean, I think, like, the flip side of this though, is like, you gotta ask, what are the users of pith? Right? And I think there's probably been some.
00:26:55.168 - 00:27:08.700, Speaker B: Surprises there and maybe diving into that, what type of applications predominantly use pith? And I guess any predictions on new companies continuing to onboard with pith?
00:27:09.000 - 00:27:33.698, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I think the biggest. Been a couple of surprises there. I think one of the big surprises for me has been just how popular perps are. I think this year has been the year of perps. There are perps exchanges just everywhere now that didn't used to be the case you had a couple last year, but it's really the trend. I think that was surprising.
00:27:33.698 - 00:27:55.058, Speaker A: And I think it's actually interesting because I think a lot of those purpose exchanges actually use pith. I think pithead has kind of just made it a lot easier to build that kind of system. Right. Because if you go back in time, people were kind of rolling their own oracles to get that. If you're a purpose exchange, you need a really high frequency price update. Right. A high frequency, low latency because you're using it to mark all these positions.
00:27:55.058 - 00:28:18.588, Speaker A: And so if you go back in time, people would have to basically build their own oracle. And it's actually pretty hard to build a high frequency, low latency oracle. Right. So it's just like the technical lift required to, to launch a purpose exchange was just way bigger then. Now that you have better oracles like PiP, you can see the trend of people launching these things. I'm not saying it's easy now, but it's certainly easier.
00:28:18.764 - 00:29:06.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's fascinating to me just watching the underlying technical stacks shift from these earlier networks being much lower throughput, have longer block times, longer finalities to these much higher throughput ecosystems that have much lower latency. And when you do that, you also have to upgrade everything else in the tech stack to make it also high throughput and low latency like oracles. And I think we're going through that entire process. And then once you do that, what type of unique applications can leverage all those components? And I think the analogy that I kind of use is going from dial up to broadband and then fiber optics, and you can build new types of applications that you couldn't build on a dial up type Internet and blockchains, interesting enough, I feel like are going through a similar transition.
00:29:06.860 - 00:29:35.362, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally hear you on that. I actually love taking these sort of like early computing type metaphors to blockchains because I think they're quite applicable. And I think there's a lot of lessons you can learn there. Like even, you know, even like, like things where it's like, hey, someone had this idea in the nineties and it was a total failure in the nineties because, like, nobody was connected to the Internet. And, but like, you know, it was obvious. I mean, I mean, it's like the kind of thing that seems like a good idea, you know, pets.com, let's buy pet food on the Internet seems like a great idea, right? And it's like, actually it is a great idea.
00:29:35.362 - 00:29:49.474, Speaker A: You just have to wait 20 years and call it chewy. And it works. Right. So, like, I think there's a lot of that that's going to happen here, too, where, like, as the technology improves, like, the applications that people built version one of in 2015, where it didn't make sense, like, suddenly makes sense, right?
00:29:49.642 - 00:29:54.630, Speaker B: 100%. Any favorite analogies that you have that you could share?
00:29:55.130 - 00:30:41.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I've been thinking a lot about is sort of like, how is compute gonna work in the future in the blockchain, right? Because I said this before, but we have this very fragmented situation right now where you have all these different blockchains, these different runtimes. And it seems to me like the. Well, it seems to me like the vision of maybe some folks initially when they're building blockchains is like, look, we're gonna have one blockchain. Everything is gonna run on the one blockchain. And, you know, that's fine. And, like, you look at that, it's like, look, there's not, like, there's. The blockchain is basically a single computer, right? So it's like, there's not gonna be a single computer for the entire world.
00:30:41.334 - 00:31:12.130, Speaker A: Like, there's just not enough. There's no way to make that computer big enough so that everybody has their fair share on the thing, right? So I think about it like, those kinds of blockchains are basically like. They're basically like mainframes, right? It's like a shared computing environment that everybody sits down and works on. Then you reach this stage where it's like, hey, now all of a sudden it doesn't fit on this one mainframe. What are we going to do now? We're in this phase where we're creating all these different chains. It's more like the PC era where it's, you get your own chain for your own application. That's actually more.
00:31:12.130 - 00:31:34.372, Speaker A: There's all these roll up as a service things right now where you get your own app chain. That's very much the PC era of things. I think that's an interesting trend. I think there's probably some broader lessons you can tease apart there, which I haven't from, like how this is going to evolve in the future. Because, like, you know, it didn't end. The PCs, right? I mean, went to cloud, there's distributed systems. I don't know what that looks like in crypto.
00:31:34.372 - 00:31:36.852, Speaker A: I don't know if we need. That seems complicated. Yeah.
00:31:36.916 - 00:32:01.810, Speaker B: That was going to be my next question. If kind of like the modular roll up landscape or application specific chain is like the PC era. Do we go back to a few central, not central, but I kind of five key players in terms of these big cloud providers or five big vms that people kind of agree upon and are predominantly used within these ecosystems.
00:32:01.850 - 00:32:41.610, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think the vms probably do consolidate because there's a really strong network effect to the APIs of the virtual machine. Right. I mean, I see this all the time because look, EVM, just by virtue of being the first, I think has a lot of backing behind it. There's a lot of people who built tools for it and things like that, that just every new vm has to build. And sometimes it's stuff that you don't even think about, but is actually really important. For example, you want a multisig, you want to have a multisig on your network.
00:32:41.610 - 00:33:07.898, Speaker A: Well, someone has to build that if you have a new vm, whereas on EVM it's already built. Or software libraries. We're just doing common things that contract developers. Developers want to do you have that in EVM? I think the network effect around some of these blockchain runtimes is very strong. It's the same as right now. How many operating systems do people really use? It's windows, Linux, Mac. You don't really run serious software on a Mac.
00:33:07.898 - 00:33:33.328, Speaker A: It's a PC, but it's not like you're running servers with Mac OS on it. There's really two. There were definitely more competitors back in the day. It's just the network effects are really strong. I think the runtime environments, I think consolidate a bit. In terms of how many instances of those runtimes are there. I don't know.
00:33:33.328 - 00:33:52.674, Speaker A: My expectation is that there's going to be a lot because the history of computing is basically that people just want more of it and it scales both vertically and horizontally. It's like, look, we have this one network and it does 100 transactions. Now it does 200 transactions per second. Great. But I want 5000, so I'm going to spin up 20. Right?
00:33:52.842 - 00:34:32.006, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree there. I think the human desire is really, you can't, you always want more. You're always going to kind of need more bandwidth to propagate that data. You're always going to need more compute or more cores. I am personally biased towards the architecture designs that lean into that philosophy of just scaling bandwidth and scaling compute, just because. To your point, I don't know if there will ever be. If you give an engineer more resources, I think they'll figure out a way to utilize them 100%.
00:34:32.158 - 00:34:46.880, Speaker A: People will say it's cheap enough now so I can deploy my new application and then you start seeing new apps or whatever. There's a name for this, it's called Jevin's Paradox. It happens with roads and things like that. It's just the way the world.
00:34:47.340 - 00:35:16.630, Speaker B: Yeah, it is fascinating, I guess, in terms of just where you see not the blockchain landscape going forward, but more so just pith network and things that you're excited about at neural labs. Are there any kind of behind, not behind the scenes, but I. What future insights would you like to see or future product requests given to the network?
00:35:17.090 - 00:35:42.510, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'll tell you a bit about what's kind of going on now or what's sort of top of mind, which is I got two things. I mean, there's a lot of stuff happening, right? There's a lot of new blockchains, things like that. But two major things I think are. One is decentralized governance with the token launch and everything. A couple of weeks ago we also launched decentralized governance. Token holders basically control the protocol now.
00:35:42.510 - 00:36:26.136, Speaker A: That's fine from a technical perspective, they control the protocol, but there's a whole social layer to that that people need to decide on. And those people aren't me, it's the community of token holders. But figuring out how that social governance process is going to work I think is really important. And at Duralabs we've gone through governance processes and a number of other protocols where it's like, hey, integrate pith and you talk to the stakeholders and things like that. And we've gone through effective processes, we've gone through ineffective processes. I think getting this right is pretty important for the health of the network as a whole. And so that's definitely something where we have some thoughts about how it should work.
00:36:26.136 - 00:36:53.786, Speaker A: We have to go talk to other stakeholders and come up with some consensus there. But that's definitely something that's top of mind for us to work on. We've got another thing that's happening. Interesting thing is Pyth is launching a random number product. This is live in Testnet. It's not a secret, but it's live in testnet on a couple of networks right now. This is a new area for us.
00:36:53.786 - 00:37:11.658, Speaker A: Random numbers is pretty much the most common thing that people ask for when they're talking to pit. The most common thing we don't support. It's cool to finally be able to scratch that itch. We have a different take on random numbers than other protocols that have come before us. It'll be interesting to see how that plays out.
00:37:11.834 - 00:37:41.250, Speaker B: I would love to dive into that a bit further because I actually just recorded a podcast with Avery, who is the CTO of Aptos, and they're going to be working on some random numbers as well, built into the protocol. So this is kind of a couple times that I'm hearing about it now and love to dive deeper into why are random numbers exciting? Why are people now focusing engineering and efforts to making this happen?
00:37:41.750 - 00:38:10.600, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, I think random numbers have been used on the blockchain for a number of applications already, right? I mean, people really want them for NFT mints, you want to decide the attributes that each NFT gets, or you want to do some sort of raffle or something like that. Or games. Games are a big one for these random numbers. There's a bunch of different applications that want the random numbers, I think, in terms of. People have built solutions for this also. We're certainly not the first people to try to solve this problem.
00:38:10.600 - 00:38:51.380, Speaker A: There's a lot of different technical approaches to doing random numbers on the blockchain. Maybe just to say a word about this, actually, which might not be obvious, is like, if you're a computer scientist and you're listening to this and you're not familiar with blockchain, you might say, why is it hard to generate a random number? I mean, like, on your computer, you just type rand or whatever, and you get a number. It's like, fine. But the thing about the blockchain is that the state of the system is deterministic. So basically, every. If you just ran the computation on the blockchain, everybody would be able to know what the random number is before it was generated. And for things like an NFT mint, you don't want people sitting there trying to game it where they're like, okay, look, the number is going to be seven, and that's a good attribute.
00:38:51.380 - 00:39:15.910, Speaker A: So quick, send a transaction. You want it to be unpredictable. So that's kind of the reason why it actually requires some engineering work. And it's not just some trivial thing now. Yeah, I mean, I don't know why. Maybe now in particular is a time that people are paying attention to it. I mean, I do think that the high throughput trains have, um, create an opportunity for, like, games and things like that to come on the blockchain.
00:39:15.910 - 00:39:27.610, Speaker A: And I think that's the place where, like, you'll see serious usage of random numbers, right? Things like NFT mints. Are sort of one offs. So it's not like maybe it's not the most compelling thing to serve. Um, so that's interesting.
00:39:28.630 - 00:39:58.160, Speaker B: Yeah. It, uh. The gaming aspect, kind of to your point on like, random loot, or making sure that it's actually truly random and nothing. Someone able to gamify the underlying technology or to gain an unfair advantage or even one thing that blockchains have been kind of popular for is gambling. If gambling people ultimately want to use randomness, that is very important.
00:39:59.500 - 00:40:29.746, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think one of the things that's actually interesting here is you can have provably fair random numbers. Right. One of the properties of the protocol that pith is developing here is that as long as the user is honest and they participate in the protocol following the rules, they can guarantee that the result is random. They don't need to trust the protocol, they don't need to trust anybody on the other side. All they have to do is behave honestly and they know the result is random. That's a really cool property.
00:40:29.746 - 00:40:40.740, Speaker A: That's something where if you go to the casino and you push the button on the slot machine, maybe it tells you your odds of winning are 1%. Hey, you don't really know. Right? Whereas in this case, you can actually know for sure.
00:40:41.280 - 00:40:52.940, Speaker B: That is very true. I think one of the exciting things about the blockchain is the provableness of it. You don't have to trust, per se. You can also verify.
00:40:53.680 - 00:41:17.724, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And the transparency, I think, is very, very powerful. Actually, another maybe thing on transparency is like. Like for pith, for example, we have this blockchain, pithnet, where all the data providers are aggregating their prices. This is fully transparent. It's a Solana network. You can actually view the state of the system using a Solana explorer.
00:41:17.724 - 00:41:33.290, Speaker A: You can actually go and see all the prices that people are contributing. You can see exactly how pith works. I think that's a really cool property of the system. I don't know, maybe it's discounted. Right? Or like, it's certainly different from like, web two, where it's like, totally opaque.
00:41:33.790 - 00:42:10.786, Speaker B: 100% in terms of kind of where you see or where you kind of see the industry going for like the next year. I think it's been unfortunately or fortunately, the industry is very cyclical. We've had a lot of ups and downs with bull markets, with bear markets, with large players ultimately taking a painful death. Is there anything that you're either learning lessons or things that you're trying to avoid? Things that you've taken away from, like.
00:42:10.818 - 00:42:55.184, Speaker A: The past couple of years, man, I gotta say, the biggest lesson for me is, you know, leverage is dangerous. Like, I knew that, but, like, man, it's really dangerous. And also, people will take a lot more of it than you expect. That part really surprised me the last time around. So, yeah, I mean, that's maybe not a lesson for developers, but the thing I'll say is, we've been in this little bear market, things are feeling a little better right now. I think some of the pit folks were at Devconnect and they were pretty bullish over there. It seems like people are pretty amped up, but it seems to me people are still building software and doing the work, and that's great.
00:42:55.184 - 00:43:11.500, Speaker A: And, I don't know, I'm happy they're doing that. I'm happy they'll probably do more of that in the bull market. And just try to keep your head down and focus on building. And don't get too worried about the token prices.
00:43:12.600 - 00:43:51.780, Speaker B: Yeah, token prices are hard not to look at. They often bring people in, people they can be distracting a lot of shining new objects within, not only crypto, but within tech. I think for people that are engineers specifically, that are interested in the industry and want to make a jump similar to you from AI or any other field that are interested in blockchain technology from the engineering point of ice or engineering point of view, is there any advice that you could give those individuals to dip their toes in the water?
00:43:52.160 - 00:44:27.636, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I mean, I would say, first of all, if you're interested, you should do it like, this has been by far the most fun job I have had. Crypto is just, it's a great space to work in. It's tremendously collaborative because it really is an ecosystem, and there's a lot of different companies and people who are working on different things, and you have a lot of opportunities to interact, not just within your organization, but outside. That part's been really, really cool. It's all open source development. You can actually write code with people who work somewhere else.
00:44:27.636 - 00:44:51.380, Speaker A: It's really cool. It's really a fun job. I would highly recommend it in terms of what to do. I guess the thing I'd say here is, this is a meme last cycle. It's early, and it is actually still early. There aren't that many people who know what they're doing in the blockchain space. It's a relatively new field.
00:44:51.380 - 00:45:13.420, Speaker A: I wouldn't be intimidated by saying I want to do blockchain, but I don't know anything. You know what? Just jump in. Go write some contracts. Pick a blockchain, I don't care. Pick whatever blockchain you want. Go deploy an application. You'll pick up the basics pretty quickly, and you can become pretty knowledgeable in a year or two.
00:45:13.420 - 00:45:30.520, Speaker A: You can basically reach the edge of maybe application developers on the field in a pretty short period of time. That's really not true in other areas. I think it's a great time to get involved. While it's early, you have an opportunity to make a name for yourself. We definitely encourage you to jump in and do it.
00:45:31.300 - 00:46:11.380, Speaker B: I couldn't echo that more. I think when I got involved in 2017, I felt like I was late. I really felt early again when 2020 and Defi Summer was going on, just because I started to actually play around with SQL queries on doing analytics and started being like, all right, how many active addresses are actually in these blockchains? And it's very few. And to your point, I mean, you can become an expert in the field relatively quickly if you focus on the correct things and put in the work. It is complicated, but if you're interested and want to learn more, you can definitely make your name for yourself.
00:46:12.120 - 00:46:48.800, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's always good to be just in a nascent and growing space. If you move into a space that's older, has more of a history to it. First of all, there's just a lot of ramp up time to learn to get to the edges. And then secondly, there's already a lot of people who are well known experts, and it's just harder to break into those ranks. Whereas if you join something that's early and growing, that's sort of whatever, you're riding a bigger wave and you kind of always want to be doing that.
00:46:50.580 - 00:47:07.050, Speaker B: I couldn't agree more. In terms maybe wrapping up, are there anything that you feel like we miss in the podcast or did not cover from a technical side, a community side, any last tidbits that we miss?
00:47:07.910 - 00:47:17.690, Speaker A: Man, that's an open ended question. Let's see. I mean, I can't think of anything offhand.
00:47:19.910 - 00:47:37.090, Speaker B: Okay. Framing it another way. If people were to take one or two main points from our conversation or this conversation, what are the biggest things that you feel like people should come away with, either from Dura labs or Pitnet and what you guys are building there?
00:47:37.710 - 00:48:28.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're building a really interesting kind of new take on oracles. Right. We're really committed to some of the crypto principles of decentralization and things like that, which I think in the oracle space are maybe, let's say not respected as much as you would hope. But we really are trying to build a decentralized oracle with sustainable economics for all the parties involved and have this work, high frequency, low latency, all that stuff. One thing that I would like to I guess maybe this is the thing that people forget a lot, which is, I think in crypto Twitter, people always go and they're like, pith, that's a Solana oracle. But pith is really a lot bigger than that these days. Actually, the majority of the applications that use Pyth are not on Solana and we're on 40 blockchains.
00:48:28.820 - 00:48:51.056, Speaker A: It's a very different world than it might have been a year ago. If that's when you last heard about pith, definitely would encourage developers especially. Come check it out. We're available on Discord Telegram. Shoot us a note if you have questions about integrating. But I guess I think it's a good oracle. Check it out, check it out.
00:48:51.128 - 00:49:03.120, Speaker B: Perfect. Well, we'll end it there. Thank you so much, Jant, for coming on the podcast. Finally excited that we made it through. Got to record this one and excited for the public to listen to it.
00:49:03.280 - 00:49:05.096, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks a lot for having me, Logan.
00:49:05.288 - 00:49:05.760, Speaker B: Thank you.
