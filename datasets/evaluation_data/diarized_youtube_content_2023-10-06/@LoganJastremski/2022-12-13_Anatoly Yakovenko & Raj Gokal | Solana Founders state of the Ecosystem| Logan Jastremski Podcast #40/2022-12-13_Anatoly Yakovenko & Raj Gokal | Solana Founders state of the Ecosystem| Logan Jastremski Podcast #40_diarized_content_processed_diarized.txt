00:00:00.320 - 00:00:29.046, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, super excited to do this podcast. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Raj and Toli, I think again, ultimately extremely impressed with what you guys have built with Solana, the team. I think where I would love to start ultimately with the podcast is maybe just reflecting a little bit. Solana has had a crazy past couple of years. Ultimately you're born in the bear market and ultimately launched in the bear market.
00:00:29.046 - 00:00:45.490, Speaker A: But I wanted to start maybe with some of your reflections from kind of when Testnet went live or I guess now mainnet beta and then kind of some of the big learnings and lessons that you guys went through through 2021.
00:00:48.750 - 00:02:07.500, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been like quite a journey. I think, like I would say over the last three months we've finally gotten like, I feel like at the core engineering team, like over this like whole two and a half years, that we're not like fighting fires, that we're actually like building stuff for the, for like the future. I think I would say like from like the first day of launching main, we started calling it fire driven development because there was basically like a fire every day that was very important to fix as soon as possible. But I think recently, as folks have seen performance on the network dramatically improve in terms of reliability and consistency, validators have just been showing stats like, hey look, everything is, you can literally see between 113 release and all the previous ones how smoother all the Grafana dashboards have gotten. So it really feels like we have an opportunity right now to start building and fixing problems that are forward thinking. It's like if you've been a linux developer, I think folks remember the 2.4 to 2.6
00:02:07.500 - 00:02:12.060, Speaker B: kernel transition. That was a very rough one. It feels like that's what we went through.
00:02:12.360 - 00:02:58.600, Speaker A: Yeah, I would definitely echo the sentiments. I think ultimately now the industry more broadly continues to suffer from different punches and blowbacks. But ultimately I think it was definitely amazing to watch Solana's growth in the 2021 period. Initially on the Solana pitch stack, it was blockchain at Nasdaq speed. Ultimately, I think what really transpired or really found product market fit first was ultimately nfts. Could you talk maybe a little bit about how you envision the network growing and then how it actually unfolded?
00:03:00.220 - 00:03:42.846, Speaker B: Well, like we thought that the most transaction heavy use cases are going to be machine driven and financial. And that's kind of like thinking like market makers and people participating in DeFi, these are going to be like the number one users. And that actually turned out to be true. You look at even today by raw aggregate amount of transactions. Pith and serum are like the two dominant applications. One is an oracle for financial data, the other one is a central limit order book for trading. So those take up the vast majority of the load or create the vast majority of the load.
00:03:42.846 - 00:04:22.424, Speaker B: But in terms of user numbers, nfts kind of exploded out of nowhere. We really didn't anticipate that at all. But I've always had an open mind. I think internally we thought, ok, this central limit order book use case is the hardest one, that's the hardest one to build, and it needs to be really, really good to be competitive with CME and NYSE and Nasdaq. If we can get even remotely close, the technology is going to be good for everything else. It's going to be awesome for any kind of web3 use cases. So that was really kind of our thesis and I think that one worked out pretty well.
00:04:22.424 - 00:04:24.620, Speaker B: I think we were right in the money there.
00:04:24.920 - 00:04:25.660, Speaker A: Nice.
00:04:26.520 - 00:05:54.080, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think there are kind of two phases there. And actually before DeFi existed on Solana, I think the first things that people saw that would have pointed to the idea of product market fit was just teams like kin that had already tried scaling up on Ethereum, and kin was on stellar, and then they had a private fork of stellar. And then when they thought about their 5 million users and what they would do if it five x or ten x, they pretty quickly realized they needed something more scalable and decided to move over. And then I think the central limit order book primitive and the Defi ecosystem happened really fast and that all got kicked off more or less by serum. That was really just a few months after Mainnet went live, after we were demoing break and had shown that the network had stabilized. But I think both in Solana and in Ethereum, just across crypto, there seemed to be a ceiling of just how many users concurrently would be daily users and, and active consumers of new DeFi primitives. And it looked like tens of thousands, but I think it was like summer of 2021.
00:05:54.080 - 00:07:17.536, Speaker C: So just over a year ago, it feels like ten years ago that DGEN Ape Academy launched on Solana after Metaplex, and that was the first time we saw a couple hundred thousand users concurrently and having the time of their lives trying to access that mint. And that was like a new phase of product market fit where it was a completely different asset class, totally different style of users. And I think the expectation within maybe like a couple months would be, maybe we would expand beyond profile photos and there would be music, nfts and video nfts, and they would all be composable, and you could have video game assets for characters and weapons, that it would evolve quickly. I think the surprise has been that pfps have been so resilient as an asset class, and that they would be the organizing principle for communities to just organize together and find each other and resonate over art styles and refer back to the cultural evolution before them. And that Solana would have its own, you know, cultural kind of like split off from Ethereum. That feels and looks very different. And, yeah, I didn't.
00:07:17.536 - 00:07:41.184, Speaker C: I don't think any of us expected that, like, seven and a half million users would have wallets with nfts in them, and that's how they would view the assets. But I think, like, what was interesting, too, is that that also stress tested the network in. In very different ways. Right? Like, all the outages, almost all the outages resulted from hotspots that come from NFT mints.
00:07:41.232 - 00:07:41.820, Speaker B: That.
00:07:43.640 - 00:08:08.524, Speaker C: Wouldn'T have been predicted if we were just building for DeFi all along. But now the network is very robust, and I think what we've just had is the community got stress tested, and the resilience of why the blockchain exists has been stress tested. It all feels like eras and phases that I'm sure will be fodder for, you know, different chapters of the book at some point. But it's all a fun story.
00:08:08.692 - 00:09:28.580, Speaker A: No, I definitely agree. And ultimately, you mentioned a couple of things in there, I think. First, I remember watching some podcasts with Anatoly in the past, talking about creating a new virtual machine and ultimately being different from the EVM, the Ethereum virtual machine, and how initially you guys kind of viewed that as negative. But now I think it really has turned in, as you mentioned, to its own culture and being highlighted by Solana's own community and seeing that prolificate over last year and this year and now being stress tested. But it's amazing to see that culture did grow and has its own vibrance, which is very exciting. One thing that I think people often kind of confuse as well is from just because Solana is so fast and low cost, it did get stress tests to the limits. Could you talk a little bit more about the limits that Solana hit and why it was so much of a challenge and maybe even compare that into some of the loads to these other networks? Because Solana has really been pushed to its core.
00:09:28.580 - 00:09:35.840, Speaker A: And I think these other networks, they did get pushed, but definitely not as much as Solana.
00:09:36.980 - 00:10:27.584, Speaker B: There's a lot of challenges in speeding up how blockchain works. And when you start with something like ethereum or bitcoin, you have a very resilient design that's very slow, and it's optimized for resiliency and not performance. And then you're trying to squeeze out maximum performance without sacrificing any of the designs that are built around that original kind of vision. And there's two kind of interesting pieces there. One is that you have like a mempool, which doesn't, which shares the transaction state. It's lossy, it's eventually consistent. It doesn't guarantee that transactions are visible by every block producer in the network, but effectively, that's kind of what it does.
00:10:27.584 - 00:11:20.844, Speaker B: And before a transaction gets packed into a block, there's this kind of very safe and robust, but somewhat slow protocol to propagating them to everyone that could potentially be a block producer, and that prevents a flood of data. While it guarantees resiliency, what it doesn't do is allow for a very large amount of transactions to be evaluated at the same time and packed into a block. And that actually impacts performance. I mean, it should be kind of obvious at a very gut level, intuitive level, that if you have a very slow process to propose things, it's going to be very hard to propose many things at the same time per second. So that that's a very fundamental difference. And why Solana can't do these, like, you know, very fast confirmations and high throughput at the same time. A large part of that is because we don't have a mempool.
00:11:20.844 - 00:12:14.966, Speaker B: We kind of operate at a different layer where we have, instead of a mempool, we have, like, transaction flows. You have, you do flow control, which is very similar to how most web two services operate. They don't typically do these sharing events with all servers on the network. They control the flow of traffic and then try to classify the traffic and separate it and make sure that none of it exceeds, like, the predefined limits. So those are like the two major kind of differences. So initially we saw, like, the first time we had like an outage, and we saw about 400,000 transactions per second being submitted to a single block producer. That sounds like a lot.
00:12:14.966 - 00:13:26.510, Speaker B: That's actually not that many requests per second for a modern hardware, but because it was handling these events in these queues that were starting to get saturated, some of them started growing out of memory and eventually ran the systems out of memory and crashed. There's a lot of these cues that go from getting a message from the network card and then checking if we've seen this duplicate message, then verifying the signatures, then checking if the message is valid, and checking is it correctly structured, can the feed pair actually afford it? And then executing it, making sure that it actually works and does the right thing. And then packing into a block. Each one of these steps is, think of it as a separate queue in this pipeline, and you want to do these things, steps as fast as you can. And you're trying to do the fastest steps first, the cheapest and fastest ones first, because you're trying to whittle down the amount of invalid traffic that gets to the final step, which is let's actually execute it and back into a block. So at 400,000, I forget which queue was the one that was bad that time. Like one of the queues blew up.
00:13:27.370 - 00:13:33.110, Speaker A: And just for reference, other blockchains or ethereum specifically, is doing, what, 13 transactions per second?
00:13:33.890 - 00:13:39.770, Speaker B: Well, this is kind of a separate part, because ethereum doesn't have the mempool control.
00:13:39.890 - 00:13:40.794, Speaker A: They do have the mempool.
00:13:40.842 - 00:14:24.290, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, they have a mempool. So you could submit 400,000 requests into the mempool, but vast majority of them are going to get rejected because nodes are just simply not going to accept any more data from you. So in our case, the leader is very greedy. They're trying to maximize the amount of flow that they're receiving to kind of figure out what are the best transactions. And that was like, I think that was a few, that was like four mbps or something like that we saw. So that was like just a bug where we had an unbounded queue. The second bug was at about 20.
00:14:24.290 - 00:14:33.418, Speaker B: That was like one or two gpps. The second bug that we hit was about 20 gigabits per second.
00:14:33.594 - 00:14:34.442, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:14:34.586 - 00:15:31.970, Speaker B: And that was hitting like a few. That went from 400,000 transactions per second being submitted to about 4,000,002 to 4 million transactions per second being submitted to a single validator. So the use cases for this is still, it wasn't Defi. The irony is that while Defoe generates the most orders and transactions, people write pretty decent bots, and they know how to control their own traffic. They don't just spam the network for NFT mints. I guess people were just as eager and aggressive as possible to get these NFTs. So they kept, I think people literally built botnets to go submit these, because the attack after that one hit 100 gigabits at a couple nodes, and Bitfinex called it a DDoS, and some of the data centers actually flagged it as a potential DDoS attack.
00:15:31.970 - 00:16:15.174, Speaker B: The cool thing is that a bunch of the nodes that have dphier hardware actually survived. So you had more sophisticated setups that were running two cpu based Xeon systems with super fast IO and a ton of memory. Those were able to drop that traffic fast enough and limit how much memory was being growing. But some of the weaker, like a bunch of the weaker systems, and more than a third of the stake running on those weaker systems, once they got overwhelmed, they got knocked down. So we had to. While all this was happening, we kind of knew what the solution was. And it's a multi part solution.
00:16:15.174 - 00:16:56.742, Speaker B: You really need to limit the ability for all these bots to submit unlimited traffic to begin with. So we had to switch from UDP, which is a protocol used in a lot of finance, like when you typically talk to an exchange like Nasdaq or NYSE or CME use UDP. So we have to switch from UDP to QUic, which is also UDP based. But it's a modern day Internet protocol built by Google. It's like over a decade old that has flow control, so we can tell the sender to stop, or they have to stop, or they get dropped. Their connections or all their data start getting dropped at servers upstream, at switches upstream. So that was one thing.
00:16:56.742 - 00:17:55.702, Speaker B: Then we had to start managing the flow of data that's coming in. So you can't have unstaked botnets that create a whole bunch of small civil nodes that all send 1000 transactions each. You don't want to give somebody an incentive to create 1000 small nodes that all spam you a little bit at a time because it creates the same effects. So that was the quality of service stake weighted thing that we added. And the third thing was that you really want to disincentivize people from sending the same transaction twice, or even if they don't do it naively and simply copy it and send it twice. But they tweak some value in the message to generate a second message and send the exact same bid for a mint, just with some randomization there. What we want them to do is instead to pay more to the network, to jump ahead to the front of the queue and to be first.
00:17:55.702 - 00:17:58.046, Speaker B: So that was the standardization scheme.
00:17:58.238 - 00:18:19.090, Speaker A: So ultimately you implemented these fixes. Solana has ultimately experienced those kind of multiple downtimes going forward, I guess, for kind of the non technical people. Are these the fixes that are needed to keep Solana up.
00:18:20.080 - 00:19:05.188, Speaker B: Yeah, for the most part, against these kinds of attacks where you're being overwhelmed with data, those are the fixes that you need. So I think the design is robust, and we kind of saw it work during the FTX meltdown. That part I'm confident in. But there's other parts that could cause Solana to halt. It's designed to be a system that picks safety over liveness. So, for example, it's a parallel runtime, which are very hard to build to begin with, where you want to execute multiple things at the same time. And in a blockchain, if, like in a web service like Facebook, if you have non determinism, something executes first or second.
00:19:05.188 - 00:19:45.934, Speaker B: Maybe a user a sees 200 likes in a message, somebody else sees 150 likes on Twitter or whatever. On Facebook, it's not a big deal. That kind of inconsistency doesn't really matter and maybe eventually gets reconciled and resolved and repaired later. So stuff like that is fine for Twitter, but that's catastrophic for our financial system. It has to be both parallel and deterministic. And there's a lot of safety features that we added to the runtime that it executes the transaction. Every machine executes them randomly, so you don't know the order what machine is going to execute.
00:19:45.934 - 00:20:06.792, Speaker B: The virtual machine itself is actually encrypted locally, so any state that gets read and written is encrypted. So if there's a VM escape, that the data that escape attack reads is going to be different on every computer. So all of those things would force the network to diverge and halt and just give up. Hey, something went wrong.
00:20:06.926 - 00:20:07.460, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:20:07.500 - 00:20:36.780, Speaker B: And, like, nobody can agree in the final state, so the network stops. So those kinds of bugs are hopefully extremely rare, but there's no way to guarantee, there's no way to write a proof that they don't exist. But what makes me confident is that, like, efforts like fire dancer, where there's a second implementation of a Solana client, will make it much less likely that the exact same bug exists in both clients. When you have a failure in one, the other one can recover and continue.
00:20:36.940 - 00:21:16.322, Speaker A: I definitely want to talk about Faidanser down the line. I want to recap, ultimately, 2021. You guys had this crazy year way more, I would say, growth maybe than you expected or it was definitely parabolic. Network got stress tested a lot. Ultimately did go down a few times with the updates to the network that you've outlined. You're very confident in the downtime being minimized. But for those that maybe kind of continue to point out a critique like Solana has gone down.
00:21:16.322 - 00:21:21.030, Speaker A: What would your answer be to them going forward?
00:21:24.690 - 00:22:04.308, Speaker B: Well, I think there's kind of two kinds of, there's, I think, different kinds of users that I think are really important in the ecosystem. I think for a lot of the NFT use cases, the downtime was just an inconvenience, so you couldn't do a mint at that time. You had to delay, and that sucks. But it's not catastrophic, I think, for Defi, these are like the much harder conversations that you need to have, and there you have these really, really hard trade offs. There's just no way to build the kind of stuff you can do on Solana. Another chance. You need central limit order books, you need low latency confirmation times and very, very cheap transactions to build these things.
00:22:04.308 - 00:22:52.600, Speaker B: And if you go somewhere else, you're really trading off the innovation of that particular model for not being able to differentiate on tech at all, because now you're stuck building slow systems, and all those designs converge on a certain thing. So those are the trade offs, and I think developers make those internally and pick and choose. But we've seen the devs that build on Solana really believe in everything that the community is building and the core engineers that are making the network better and better. And they're the engineers that understand the risks and they see the network improving, and they're able to make that decision and feel confident that the probability of something happening gets lower and lower with every day and with every release.
00:22:53.180 - 00:22:53.980, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:22:54.140 - 00:23:43.194, Speaker C: I would add, like, you know, any, any other proof of stake. Blockchains that have real usage have had outages, too, but you just don't hear about them much. I think, you know, for a couple reasons. One is you don't have as many, like, vocal, passionate users that are using those, those blockchains that you know, that go and complain on Twitter. And then two is, I think Solana through 2021 through 2022 has the most diversity of developers use cases. It's clearly shown the highest throughput by orders of magnitude. It's the chain to beat as far as next generation chains with much higher throughput that have a chance of scaling to billions of users.
00:23:43.194 - 00:24:58.592, Speaker C: And I think the scrutiny and the level of, I think, kind of memes that folks choose to propagate, to point out any flaws in the chain is just super intense, I think. And we haven't done as much of a good job of, like, combating that with all the positive narratives of everything that's happening. On the chain. And so that's why I think podcasts like yours and the work that you and Diego do, and other folks who stepped up after breakpoint to just tell those stories of what's getting built, what communities exist here, the types of products and experiences that couldn't exist elsewhere, and why it's worth pushing through some of these performance hiccups. Those stories are super important, and I think Solana ecosystem has just gotten really good at doing that. So, yeah, I think that's a really big focus for the next year. The other thing I'll say is, I think we've always been looking at the user numbers, the developer numbers around these outages.
00:24:58.592 - 00:25:31.088, Speaker C: It doesn't really affect retention. But what does affect retention is that perception problem where everyone constantly has to explain. It's not just the chain that goes down. There's a lot of other things about it that make it worth building on. And I think we hit a breaking point in the second half of this year where important decision makers only knew about the outages. They didn't know about the data propagation metric that you guys point to. They didn't know about the throughput.
00:25:31.088 - 00:26:03.200, Speaker C: They didn't know how robust it is and how much has been built on it. And I think it's kind of like if ethereum was only ever known for the Dao hack. There's some element of that trial and tribulation that you have to go through as a chain to build resiliency. But there's also a need for everyone in the community to tell the stories of what else is happening on that chain, and not just lethemena. Let it be a one note reputation. I think we're moving past that. For what it's worth.
00:26:03.200 - 00:26:34.996, Speaker C: Even in the volatility of the FTX collapse, all these problems existed in that time. There were huge liquidation events, and there was a ton of market volatility, and DeFi volume was six x what it was the day before, and the chain was just moving along smoothly. So I think it's probably going to be a 2022 narrative, and then in 2023, there's going to be more stories of just what's being built on chain.
00:26:35.148 - 00:27:13.920, Speaker A: Yeah, I fully agree, and I think you brought up a lot of great points there. Ultimately, Solana kind of being this next generation chain, and this is ultimately one of the community questions that I asked this morning, like, what do you feel or wish everybody understood about Solana, even maybe including power users. That is like a big misconception, maybe on the next generation stuff like why high throughput is important, or some of the user metrics adoptions, because I definitely agree, Raj. I think there's a lot of misinformation. What are some of the biggest things that you feel like people, even maybe in the Solana community, misunderstand?
00:27:15.460 - 00:28:15.818, Speaker B: I would say the biggest thing that annoys me is people that just say that it's not decentralized without really understanding what they're even saying. I think that's like the biggest annoyance. I think what people need to understand is that decentralization is very important, but the network and every optimization that we're doing is with decentralization in mind first. And that really starts at the core of layer one. Design is based on the idea that if we optimize the software to take advantage of hardware, then when people need more access to the network by adding more nodes, they need more validation that they're not limited by a subcommittee limit or some other limits that they actually can't scale it to whatever the world's demand. If the world really needs 50,000 validators to all observe the Solano state, we can support that. It's just a matter of hardware and software optimizations.
00:28:15.818 - 00:29:07.066, Speaker B: And that doesn't require changing the design, it doesn't require increasing the fees for everyone. That's the core part here. So the only difference between this vision between what Solana is building and what Ethereum is building is this idea of the cost of the hardware. That's about it. My argument has always been that if you can get the problem to be a hardware cost problem, then you've kind of done. Because if it's not, if it's, let's say it's eight times too expensive, that's like, how many years is that going to take? Six years before Moore's Law and TSMC and everyone else reduces the cost to where it's negligible. That's the huge advantage of being dependent on probably the best, most optimized industry in the world.
00:29:07.066 - 00:29:12.630, Speaker B: It's just how fast people can ship upgrades to the computers that we use on a day to day basis.
00:29:15.330 - 00:29:48.928, Speaker C: Somehow. I mean, and this is really like enthusiasts who are not super technical, not really paying attention, but they matter, right? A lot of them are choosing which blockchains to use or pay attention to. They somehow think that because validators were able to communicate enough together to initiate a restart, that means they're more centralized than, you know, than other chains, or that it's like one person that's like, that's flipping the switch, which is just ridiculous.
00:29:48.984 - 00:30:27.560, Speaker B: Obviously. And, like, the whole point of these systems, right, that are based in cryptography, is that with cryptography, we can actually scale very complex decisions to a very large number of users around the world. That's kind of the whole idea, right? Like, the validators are not trusting each other or trusting some snapshot. Everyone has their local ledger state. They verify that they all generate the exact same snapshot. And if somebody starts generating incorrect snapshots, they actually debug it and figure out, is your ledger incorrect? And stuff like that, and repair it. And, like, all that process is based on not trusting anyone else, but only trusting your own data and being able to verify that.
00:30:27.560 - 00:31:14.020, Speaker B: So that part's pretty. There's a lot of small misconceptions like that, that I think people don't dig into the details. Like the fact that the validators are able to restart on their own and continue the network. That's a measure of resiliency, because no matter what you do, there's no way for you to be robust against Internet cables being cut in a global Internet that lives in this world, where there's major world powers that at some point could decide that they need to bifurcate the Internet, right? Without real, any notice, stuff like that can happen, and you need systems that can recover the state and continue it in those events.
00:31:14.720 - 00:31:56.270, Speaker A: I fully agree. I mean, ultimately, and I think, Raj, you said this earlier, the narrative has kind of been spun a little bit. And I think I, in my point of view, Solana's design is actually more simplistic in some regards than Ethereum. But what Ethereum has specifically done, I think, very well is pushing or at least telling their story and their narrative going forward for 2023. What, in your point of view, would be a good narrative or a story for the Solana community to kind of tell, to help kind of fight some of the misinformation that's being put out there.
00:31:57.410 - 00:32:40.302, Speaker B: I think one thing that at least resonates with me is that Solana is as cheap in terms of hardware as possible for the thing that it's trying to achieve. And that vision is very different from Ethereum. Like, if you need settlement guarantees and you don't really care about the time or anything or the execution, you can use Ethereum, but that doesn't go. That's not going to provide you, like, a free, open financial system. Most of the money that tradefire makes is not in settlement. Like, the settlement houses are, like, the last step and the most boring step, and there's very little margin there. You make almost nothing like being doing settlement, like everything else, is an execution.
00:32:40.302 - 00:33:18.774, Speaker B: And execution depends on the really, really hard problems that you have to deal with. Decentralized sequencing and propagating information, not delaying. That, like a small group of users can observe all the trades before everyone else and take advantage of that information asymmetry and make all the money, all the math. Those problems are really, really hard to tackle. And the way we've designed Solana is to propagate information as fast as physics allow. At its final form, state transitions are going to move through the network at the speed of light, through fiber, as fast as news. There's no information asymmetry between anyone in the world.
00:33:18.774 - 00:34:19.630, Speaker B: That means that, like, every hobbyist in the world that can connect to the network is on the same level playing field as jump trading, or like, the biggest market makers in the world. There's no, like, single sequencer or like, whatever that you need to rely on for a lot of these L2 solutions. You end up having to make compromises there in that execution environment to deal with the slow settlement interfaces to Ethereum. And this is something that's very important to me. And one of the motivations for me even working on Solana was that prior to starting Solana, my hobby was just trading on interactive brokers, Onoda and a bunch of these small sites as a hobbyist. And every time I thought I had a clever idea, my orders would get delayed and somebody would get in front of me, or the data that I was receiving would be a little too slow, and I couldn't submit fast enough. It always felt like I could never win.
00:34:19.630 - 00:34:46.310, Speaker B: It's very, very, actually important to have a totally globally decentralized execution engine. The way we're building it is the cheapest way to do it. We're not just throwing money out the window by making the hardware more expensive, we're actually trying to minimize the cost of that. And that's very much a very true to the decentralization vision.
00:34:46.890 - 00:35:47.200, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Chris Berniske has tried to boil it down to consensus at lightspeed, and he's talked about cosmos as the epitome, like the platonic ideal of the app chain thesis, and Solana as the platonic ideal of the monolithic, high throughput, mono chain thesis. And then Ethereum is sort of somewhere in between, and bitcoin is store of value, and I think that starts to encapsulate it. Well, I think you guys have the great chart on data propagation and just how far Solana is on that metric. And that starts to tell the story well. But I think the core problem, and this is just going to continue to be the case for Solana, because I think we're already on track to forever be the fastest, cheapest, most scalable network. If you use it, you'll see that it is just faster, it's just cheaper, and it's always the same network. You don't have to bridge across these different L2s and things.
00:35:47.200 - 00:35:51.980, Speaker C: But the core problem is it always sounds too good to be true.
00:35:52.100 - 00:35:52.800, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:53.860 - 00:37:04.620, Speaker C: And people just assume that there's something wrong, that we're cheating. And the only way that I've reliably seen people get convinced is if they talk to someone who's actually built on multiple networks, and it is actually building on Solana, and ask them, like, what was your research? How did you decide on this? You know, how do you think about it? And I think that number is only going to go up of people who've actually interacted with built on these networks. I think Audius was the first good example that I remember where they had built on POA, on Ethereum. The use case needed decentralization. They need for there to genuinely be a really difficult path to censoring transactions, because musicians, users, curators, all were depending on the state of this program, and they had users, they already had hundreds of thousands of users, and they needed to make a choice. Do we go to a L2? Do we switch to a different layer one? And nobody wants to make that switch. More than once.
00:37:04.620 - 00:38:30.452, Speaker C: Helium went through the same journey. These types of folks have teams of engineers that go through proofs of concept on at least ten different networks. And when a team goes through that kind of technical research, and it's primarily a tech choice from the engineering team, not a choice from BD or somebody in the C suite that's just reading headlines, the choice is always Solana. And I think I kind of expected that maybe that kind of product market fit with those decision makers would start to have a snowball effect in a more substantive way than it has. I think the problem is the markets have come and gone, and we're in a point of the market cycle now where it doesn't matter if you have 1000 users or a million users, the market really cares about headlines and partnerships and logos. That's not a winning strategy in the long term. And so I think, like, in the next year, whether it's consensus at light speed or 100 gigabit data propagation, the memes have to, like, come from a place of builders that are, you know, that are sorting out the message that they know to be true, that can propagate to, you know, to regular people that aren't paying that much attention.
00:38:30.596 - 00:39:35.240, Speaker A: No, I totally agree. I mean, I mean, ultimately, to your point, it's almost, it's so fast, it's so cheap and ultimately even cheaper than L2s. People are like, how is this possible? And it's funny, or in some sense, I mean, I really enjoyed my conversation and my podcast in the past, kind of doing a technical deep dive with Anatoly, but I have people come up to me that are in prominent, I'd say web, two companies in Silicon Valley that still have a hard time kind of digesting this. And so I guess, and so it is. I do agree, ultimately, I do think the technology will push us forward. But as you kind of mentioned, a lot of it today is driven by headlines, especially partnerships. How is kind of Solana's foundation, viewing some of partnerships more holistically? Because I think, yeah, today the narrative is partnerships versus just continuing to educate people and builders about the underlying tech and scaling.
00:39:36.140 - 00:40:37.238, Speaker C: Well, I think to start with, I'll just say we've never really prioritized the idea of a partnership that sounds good, that has a press release that is hypey, and that doesn't have a product team behind it to execute and iterate because crypto is still very early stage and the idea of product market fit that's repeatable and scalable to millions of users is just still. We don't know how far, how long it's going to take to reach that. You need product teams that are actively owning the integration and care with their core business metrics. They care about the success of using block space for something brand new. And that's actually really hard to find. What's easy to find is mid level, non technical decision makers that want to run a pilot but don't have the budget to run the pilot. And if you give them $10 million or $20 million, they'll have their budget covered.
00:40:37.238 - 00:41:38.586, Speaker C: It's an easy decision for their boss, and then they can go run that pilot that they've been interested in doing and they get a nice web3 bullet on their resume. That is, I think, I hope that there are experiments that get run through that process that uncover user behaviors with these large user bases that become something really scalable and really valuable for web3. But any chain can do that. Any chain can run those pilots. What we tend to look for is what's the team that knows they have something core to their business model that they're really eager to scale up to hundreds of millions of users. It tends to be something that's very disruptive to their own product or their own business model. You tend to have people that are high up technical decision makers that view blockchain as a core piece of infrastructure for themselves, that go through that research that I described earlier.
00:41:38.586 - 00:42:02.010, Speaker C: And by the time we talk to them, they've already made their decision. Right. It's not a question of like we want to shop around for grant money. It's a question of, we know Solana is the long term choice. You know, we've already started building. Our engineers have already kind of told us what they want to do with it. We have some questions, can you help answer them? So that's where we tend to focus our time.
00:42:02.350 - 00:42:43.950, Speaker A: That totally makes sense. And I definitely trying to find those long term builders is extremely important for people, I guess, that are either new to the ecosystem or really haven't done that research. Because I mean, I personally spent a year plus trying to figure all this stuff out and ultimately extremely, extremely impressed by what you guys have built and excited for ultimately this entire industry to scale and ultimately what Solana enables to do. Is there a way that we can condense that research or kind of thought process so others do not have to go through this? Or is it just going to be like a slow community building kind of one by one type process where ultimately that will be reflected in metrics over time?
00:42:44.840 - 00:43:14.442, Speaker B: I think it's unfortunately a slow process still. It took a very long time for people to think of Linux as like I need an operating system, what am I going to do? It's going to be like Linux or something like that. That was. Took a long amount of time for people to get there. Especially at big companies that could build their own operating system. Same thing with databases. You kind of get through like anytime you have these complex systems.
00:43:14.442 - 00:43:44.730, Speaker B: Just the surface area for engineers is so large that when you're looking at a generic thing versus like I have a very specific use case, we could just go implement it locally and it'll be awesome. Like these are hard trade offs that every engineering team will make. And a lot of them internally want to build their own thing because they're engineers. So it makes a lot of sense. And it takes a long time for the industry to converge on something that works well for a lot of users in a lot of use cases.
00:43:46.310 - 00:44:38.152, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely makes sense, I guess, ultimately. So trying to wrap up some of the FUD that Solana has experienced. I mean, ultimately, 2021 was crazy year in terms of growth. 2022 was kind of punches in the face for the entire industry. The last punch in the face kind of being FTX and kind of the fallout with Alameda. I want to touch upon this and then ultimately kind of move forward towards, as you mentioned, kind of the exciting things that are going on in the Solana community, especially with fire dancer. But what is kind of your message to the community and more broadly, people that are interested in building in the Solana ecosystem surrounding or some of your thoughts surrounding what happened with FTX and Sam and Alameda?
00:44:38.296 - 00:45:21.398, Speaker B: So, like, the crazy thing is that, like, the last year, we've had more growth than the year before. Like, people just look at, like, the actual, like, number of builders and developers and, like, people that started building on Solana, 21 to 22. Like, the conference literally almost doubled. And, like, in the number of attendees, it went from, like, 2000 to 3600, which is like a huge jump during this massive bear market. Right? Like, the bear market already started at the start of this year. Despite all this, the number of, like, attendees grew. The number of developers that we've seen through hacker houses has been, like, astounding.
00:45:21.398 - 00:46:12.740, Speaker B: It's been, like, tens of thousands, easily. Like, the last hackathon, we had 15,000, over 15,000 registrations, or 1000 teams submitted a project, which is pretty wild. So all of that happened during this crappy bear market. And the sponge in the face happened right at the last day of the conference, literally in the flight back with FTX. But I think looking back at, like, especially this year, it was pretty obvious that the community and the builders outgrew FTX already. The folks that, when we did interviews about which teams were impacted by the financial fallout from FTX, less than 4% said that they had funds on FTX International. Very small number of them actually had investments from FTX.
00:46:12.740 - 00:46:55.600, Speaker B: Over 80, close to 80%. I think the surveys online was done by independent party. They asked over 100 teams, like, close to 80% just had no connections to FTX at all. So you kind of already saw this transition happening. And, yeah, this punch in the face was hard because we expected FTX to be one of the folks that are going to continue building and integrating and being one of the forward thinking folks in the ecosystem. My initial vision for serum and why I thought it was such an awesome thing to work with them was that they're going to disrupt themselves. They're going to build an awesome central remote order book that's fully transparent.
00:46:55.600 - 00:47:40.102, Speaker B: There's no way for user funds to ever be at risk inside serum, and that would be a very disruptive engine for finance. But that's not how things worked out. But over the last year, you already saw an ecosystem of teams that were totally independent. And within 24 hours of the FTX shit show people fork serum, there is now an open book Dex that was rebuilt by the community that was using serum. Like, the actual developers that were independent teams that needed that technology, they were able to fork it and continue. And independent market makers, these are hobbyists that are not like, the big names that you hear about. Those are the folks that actually restarted the liquidity on it.
00:47:40.102 - 00:48:04.930, Speaker B: It was a totally community driven effort. And every day it gets better and better. So, like, stuff like that, I think is, it sucks that this happened, right? Especially the way it happened. It just really felt like a punch to the face. But I'm really amazed by the community and the folks that are building in Solana, how quickly they were able to just recover and continue.
00:48:06.390 - 00:49:11.530, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, in some comical sense. I mean, last year at breakpoint was kind of marked the picotop, and then this year, hopefully marked the Pico bottom, I guess, with FTX. But no, it was amazing, as you said, to see the community kind of rally together, fork serum, create a new project, and ultimately kind of push that forward, I guess, to, like, the people that are not as deep into the ecosystem. And I guess, to me, in some sense, this is exciting for Solana, because another critique that I constantly heard was Solana ultimately ended up as the venture capital chain. And with Alameda and FTX being such a large part of some of that critique now that being removed, I guess my question to both of you would be, what is your response? Or, yeah, what is your response to people that say Solana is kind of that VC chain or the FTX chain?
00:49:13.230 - 00:50:03.440, Speaker C: Well, I think perception really, like, lags reality. So I think it's been a while since I felt those claims held much credibility. I mean, we stopped raising money in June of 2021. I think that was the last time. And then that was around the same time that the NFT ecosystem on Solana became the main user acquisition channel. And I think that was also, if you look back to Metaplex time, at that moment, nifty gateway was capturing all of the inflows of users and funneling them towards these weekly auctions. And we thought about supporting FTX in building an FT exchange.
00:50:03.440 - 00:51:01.392, Speaker C: And FTX was approaching us, and there was a lot of demand from everyone in the industry to build something on Solana. And our approach was build on chain, build it open source, and empower creators and solve for features that they needed, like royalty fee splits on chain. And that was really the last time that there was an opportunity for FTX to build something really meaningful and big on Solana. And they chose to really focus on their centralized exchange. So mid 2021 is over a year and a half ago, there's really been this independent ecosystem of creators, developers, users that Solana ecosystem has focused on. And FTX has gone on its own since then. And still, I think as of the last month, there were these questions like, is everything on Solana being built by FTX? I think the perception is just really, really lagged reality.
00:51:01.392 - 00:52:05.490, Speaker C: And then I think I'll also say, like, there was a time when Ethereum, 10% of ETH was held by Joe Lubin, and there is this big question, like, what happens when he sells his eth? And what happens if consensus goes away or stops building a. I think these chains have to go through these big crucible moments where a lot of that perception just falls away. And I think anybody that's looking at Solana as a potential place to come build should see nothing but opportunity. Because when there's peak fear and the perception is at an all time low, and that perception is lagging reality, and people think the chain is in dire straits, that's often when all the best new businesses get built. That's where all the alpha is, all the opportunity. And I think what ends up stepping into that void is just this. It's like a hydra.
00:52:05.490 - 00:53:05.276, Speaker C: Inevitably, it's impossible for one person or one organization to fill that void. It has to be ten, because the ecosystem is ten times as big as it was a year ago, and even then, it was ten times the year before. So I think what we are already seeing is all the exchanges are rapidly moving to see where is the opportunity in Solana? What teams can we fund? What assets can we support? What role can we play in this ecosystem? I think the same is true for builders. After breakpoint, we saw so many voices of builders, like the folks that coordinated around Openbook, but also within the NFT ecosystem. And yeah, I think, like, you know, in the next year, what I expect to see is, you know, ten times as many strong voices and personalities and, you know, leaders for the ecosystem that really guide its direction. And it's going to be partially through conflict. But that's what a healthy ecosystem looks like.
00:53:05.276 - 00:53:06.960, Speaker C: Not everybody is supposed to agree.
00:53:08.060 - 00:53:43.844, Speaker A: I think you put that beautifully. Ultimately, just in the interest of time, I do want to wrap up all this kind of FUD, move on from it. So, ultimately, just to summarize, I mean, Solana had a crazy year in 2021. Network got stress tests extremely hard. I would argue much more so than these other layer ones. Ultimately, that resulted in some town times those have since multiple updates to the network have since been issued. Solana is essentially and or is designed for decentralization.
00:53:43.844 - 00:54:31.490, Speaker A: And I think that FUD is also kind of being dispelled actively. Unfortunately, the stuff happened with FTX, but I think you kind of put it beautifully and different players stepping into the ecosystem and kind of pushing it forward, but now kind of in Solana's new narrative and kind of narrative creation, what I'm personally super excited about and what honestly surprises me quite a bit is when I talk with people in the industry, is so how they lack the knowledge around fire dancer and what fire dancer is and how it ultimately will contribute to the network. So maybe there's multiple things that fire dancer does, but maybe touching upon some of the high points and what you're personally excited about with firedancer.
00:54:32.110 - 00:55:17.242, Speaker B: Yeah. This is something that I think is really, really important for the whole industry, just to see what happens. If a team that isn't fighting fires at the same time as they're doing R and D is really focused on. Given a design that's designed for hardware, how do we actually maximize throughput across modern day hardware? And can we demonstrate that the stuff that we think in theory is actually true? And this is probably the best team in the industry to go do that. It's the team that's done a bunch of the high frequency optimizations for jump trading. These are the folks that if they need to, they'll build microwaves. Because speed of lights for fiber is 0.7
00:55:17.242 - 00:55:41.204, Speaker B: c, microwaves travel faster by 30%. So they're that optimized and that nerdy. Um, like, what fire dancer does is, uh, like, we, when we started building Solana, our goal was to demonstrate, can we, that we can saturate one gigabit worth of throughput on, uh, through turbine, like, propagating data through turbine, and maybe.
00:55:41.252 - 00:55:52.628, Speaker A: Just briefly touch upon, like, bandwidth, because I think this is another thing that people misunderstand because it's core to kind of solana and the fire dancer thesis.
00:55:52.724 - 00:56:26.250, Speaker B: Yeah. So, like, um, there's a bunch of different parts where bandwidth is constrained. We talked about earlier mempools and how Solana doesn't have a mempool, and it has to shape all this traffic. So even if you have like 100 gigabits worth of traffic hitting a single node. Like a leader, they have to filter all that for valid transactions. And right now, the usages on all modern day networks in crypto, it just isn't that high. Like, I think Solana does more transactions from applications alone per day than all the other chains combined.
00:56:26.250 - 00:57:22.028, Speaker B: So if we went from like 300 tps from apps that we do today to 6700 tps, that would be like everything. That literally is everything. So maybe 1000 tps worth of valid transactions out of literally millions of proposed per second, you end up whittling it down to 1000. So that block, how fast you propagate that 1000 is your data availability bandwidth. And we called it block propagation bandwidth. This was because the industry, this was way before the industry even got consolidated to understanding that data availability and block propagation is the most important problem for layer ones. We built this really highly optimized protocol called turbine, and it's able to propagate information simultaneously to all network participants around the world at a very high rate.
00:57:22.028 - 00:58:12.284, Speaker B: So if you have a demand for like one gigabit worth of transaction data, you need about twice as much for ratio codes and twice as much for fan out. So that's roughly, you need four gigabits worth of turbine bandwidth. So our goal was to really demonstrate at a one gigabit worth of turbine bandwidth. So walking backwards, it's about 250 megabits worth of actual transaction data, or roughly. We were seeing about 200,000 gps on Google Cloud based network where we have no Internet issues. You're running over closed Internet. JMP's goal is to demonstrate that at ten gigabits, so they should be able to show two and a half million TPS in a lab on a ten gigabit network.
00:58:12.284 - 00:58:28.680, Speaker B: And that's actually like, I think, totally achievable on today's hardware. You don't need special switches, you just need like modern day cpu's and modern day motherboards with high PCI bandwidth and high decent network equipment.
00:58:29.460 - 00:58:46.810, Speaker A: And ultimately ten gigabit just allows for insane amounts of transactions per second, and ultimately more in layman terms, allowing developers to have a bigger sandbox to play in and ideate, and then ultimately allow applications to scale.
00:58:47.110 - 00:58:51.810, Speaker B: But you need that many valid transactions.
00:58:52.790 - 00:58:54.342, Speaker A: And today the demands not there.
00:58:54.406 - 00:59:42.610, Speaker B: Yeah, that's like roughly 2 million TPS. And for them to be all be valid at the same time, they have to be doing different stuff. They have to be parallelizable and doing different stuff. But in reality, what happens is that you have an NFT mint and you have a bunch of users and a bunch of bots all trying to get into the same NFT mint with 10,000 items. The maximum number of users you can support there is 10,000. The NFT mint is going to run over a couple seconds, a few thousand DP's of demand in any given spike. So that's kind of like the vast difference between the world and what the technology can achieve and the current demand.
00:59:42.610 - 01:00:21.370, Speaker B: But what's awesome about firedancer is that if they can demonstrate this, then I think we can start really pushing use cases that do need this. And this is like centrally mid order book style markets, but for a very long tail of assets and things like that. Not only you're trading spot markets like this, you're trading loans like in liquidations and everything else in lending protocols. And the more throughput we have, the more little markets we can run and the more efficient the financial infrastructure gets on chain. And that's, I think, a very, very exciting thing.
01:00:22.090 - 01:01:00.390, Speaker A: I definitely agree, and I think it's, I mean, so much misinformation about Solana, unfortunately, I think ultimately, over time, I definitely agree it will get dispelled and happy to ultimately have this conversation. Talk about a lot of the misconceptions, talk about really the exciting things coming up with fire dancer and overall just kind of the network improving on uptime and even attracting kind of higher quality builders, I guess, just in interest of time. What are some excited things, I guess, for 2023 that you're looking forward to? And we can kind of wrap it up there.
01:01:02.810 - 01:02:03.370, Speaker B: More fire dancer demos. I think they're moving really quickly through the easy stuff and I'm really excited when they get to executing the ledger state. That would be awesome. If we have two different versions of software built by two different teams that could all process the ledger and get to the same state result, that would be, I think, amazing. What I'm also excited about, I think, is like, there is, I think, opportunities for bigger companies that have built up teams that are crypto teams to continue building and really figure out, not pilots that are trying to run to get some points in marketing, but actually transformative businesses where they change how they do business. I think there's opportunity for that to happen, maybe next year even. And that would be, I think, awesome.
01:02:03.370 - 01:02:19.830, Speaker B: I think we're definitely ready for a big retailer, I don't know, target or Walmart, to go all in on stable coins and save money on spending a ton on payments. Stuff like that could happen and could really change the industry.
01:02:21.490 - 01:02:23.630, Speaker A: Raj, any closing thoughts?
01:02:24.250 - 01:03:04.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, excited Saga. The developer kits, thousands of them, are sold out and shipping this month, actually. So I think we'll expect to see new applications to get built for mobile first and user devices shipping in Q one and then another big hackathon in Q one as well. I think this is where a lot of legends are going to be made. The people that show up in the depths of the bear market and every hackathon, we've always seen new use cases like more delightful, intuitive user experiences and new business models get built. So excited about that one. Definitely fire dancer.
01:03:04.854 - 01:03:35.966, Speaker C: And then I think we're seeing a lot of big companies that are building on Solana now. Google had a bunch of announcements at Breakpoint Stripe. Eleven out of 16 of their apps they launched with were Solana based. Today, Discord announced a big integration. And all these are like I described earlier, it was engineers from the ground up choosing Solana and building on it, mostly without our help. And I expect to see more of that in the next year as well.
01:03:36.118 - 01:03:58.480, Speaker A: Perfect. Well, again, thank you so much for the time. Really, it's been amazing to watch Solana's growth and the ecosystem develop from the last couple of years and look forward to the day where there's more builders, more users, and we can kind of go past all the Fud. But I, again, really appreciate your time. And again, thank you.
01:03:59.180 - 01:03:59.900, Speaker C: Thanks, Logan.
01:03:59.940 - 01:04:00.268, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:04:00.284 - 01:04:00.732, Speaker A: Thanks, guys.
01:04:00.796 - 01:04:01.060, Speaker B: Take care.
