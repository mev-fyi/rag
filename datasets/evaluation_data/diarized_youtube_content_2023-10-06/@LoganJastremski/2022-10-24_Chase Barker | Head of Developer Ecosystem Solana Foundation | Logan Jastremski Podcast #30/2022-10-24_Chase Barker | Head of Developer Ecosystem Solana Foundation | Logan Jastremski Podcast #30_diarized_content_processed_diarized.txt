00:00:01.200 - 00:00:19.530, Speaker A: Awesome. Super excited to have you here. Chase. Really kind of been a longtime admirer of you all, your Twitter presence and really what you've done for the Solana community. So really honored to have you on the podcast and excited to chat.
00:00:19.950 - 00:00:38.018, Speaker B: Yeah, man, it's great to be here. Like, on that sort of like, Twitter comment. Like, I have no idea what happened to that account. I don't know how it became what it did. You know, half ship posting, half trying to provide some valuable information to developers. So it is what it is. It's fun.
00:00:38.018 - 00:00:39.906, Speaker B: That's pretty much all I can say.
00:00:40.098 - 00:01:17.260, Speaker A: I think that's the important thing with all of it, especially in the bear markets, is keep it fun. And the bull markets are always crazy. And I think I have to remind myself to have fun again now again, because it does get crazy. But I no, really do kind of appreciate your takes and kind of what you've done for the Solana community. I would like to maybe just start out the podcast and just learning a little bit more about your background. And I always find it fascinating about how everybody kind of journeyed into crypto. So could we start with how you got into crypto and how you ultimately got involved in the Solana community?
00:01:18.120 - 00:01:48.748, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think it's like, a lot of people probably don't know this, but I actually was an engineer for about twelve years. I was doing the web, two corporate, government contracting, a lot of like, not very fun stuff. I really, I loved coding, but I really hated that sort of world. Then like, we'll just skip all of that. Like we're say Java spring framework, JavaScript node, like just all these different things. So like that, that's it.
00:01:48.748 - 00:02:15.062, Speaker B: And it was really boring. Flash forward to 2017 and just like everybody, well, maybe not everybody. This is some people's first cycle. Started buying ethereum because bitcoin seemed too expensive. Didn't really understand what any of this shit was. I was just like most people, kind of like draw and be like, huh, the number keeps going up, maybe I should buy some of those things. Anyways, rode that to 2017, had a really good time.
00:02:15.062 - 00:02:45.744, Speaker B: Rode that all the way down. 2018 back to zero, or maybe negative at that point on that sort of stuff. So it was an interesting experience. It wasn't a very fun one. But then sometime along that time, I heard about this project called Ken, and Ken was one of the biggest icos of 2017, and they were doing something different. They were actually doing this sort of learn to earn, but it was like, use this mobile app to earn in all kinds of different ways. I think it was a little bit ahead of its time.
00:02:45.744 - 00:03:25.200, Speaker B: Nobody really paid attention. Nobody cared. But anyways, they had a developer sort of program where it was a competition, and I ended up writing for the competition, a tip bot where you use their SDK to tip crypto on Reddit, Discord, Twitter, telegram, and all these different things like that. And I really loved it. And I was like, hey, this is really cool. I reached out to everybody at their foundation, and I was like, hey, can I have a job? And they were like, all the jobs are based in Tel Aviv, but we have this developer relations role. And I was like, that's pretty cool.
00:03:25.200 - 00:03:51.306, Speaker B: What the hell is that? And I literally had no idea. I was like, no clue what it was. So started, I did a couple light research on what developer advocacy was, but decided to take the role. Realized, like, okay, we need better docs. I need to build a community. So I just started just connecting with all the builders and getting feedback. And my whole job up till today, I just made it all up.
00:03:51.306 - 00:04:32.420, Speaker B: But that's okay, because these are just a series of experiments, and you see what works and what doesn't. So following through that for two years, 2020, Ken decided to migrate to Solana, like, before pretty much anybody knew about it. So I helped with the migration and really started to pay attention to what Anatoly was saying and just really looking into it. And then I was like, well, this guy is a total scammer. Or, like, this is really big. And so we just zoom a little bit further to 2021. I was like, okay, Ken's, this has been a wonderful ride.
00:04:32.420 - 00:04:54.960, Speaker B: I'm ready to see what else I can do. And started Dming Raj and Dan Albert with the foundation and all these people. Like, hey, I helped with the migration. You remember me? You remember me. I see you have a developer advocacy role. Hire me. And just because of my relationships with some of the already existing teams, three days later, Raj sends me a.
00:04:54.960 - 00:05:41.632, Speaker B: A signal at midnight my time and was like, hey, what's up? You want to chat? So I hopped on a call, and he was like, what's your sort of, what's your motives here? Like, why do you want to work at Solana? And I told him. And then a few days later, I had an offer. And then, like, that started. Like, it was an interesting, like, journey into crypto. And then even more so interesting that I just, like, started dming, like, founders and, like, and get a job. Like, obviously, like, I had a sort of a track record, so I don't think that's super normal. But the demand for Solana was so high and the only thing that existed were the core docs at that time, which was not an easy thing to really get into Solana unless you're like Daffy or Armani or some of these other guys out in the ecosystem.
00:05:41.632 - 00:05:46.232, Speaker B: I still to this day wonder how the hell people built like, back in those days, but they did it.
00:05:46.256 - 00:06:26.870, Speaker A: So that's an amazing story. Very cool. Now, I ultimately had a similar one with kind of being involved in Ethereum in 2017 and all the trials and tribulations that came from that, but stayed with it throughout 20, 1819 and 2020. And yeah, definitely got super interested in Solano as well. But I think one of the most exciting parts about your story is just hearing your preservation and pushing forward and kind of like dming people and hustling. I think overall people kind of underappreciate how much some of those cold emails and cold DM's can actually go. And so it's super inspiring to hear.
00:06:27.330 - 00:07:12.718, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of people, like, look at me and like, I get comments all the time, like, do you even work outside of Twitter? But, like, my Twitter time is like maybe a couple hours a day. Lots of time spent on calls with, like, like dealing with education stuff. But people do not understand, like, the sort of hack that it is to grow a presence and like, be funny and shitpost, but then, like, start to red pill people. And then, like, I make these tweets and say, hey, somebody should build this thing. And then I have ten people saying, like, hey, I want to do that. And then we start to work together. Sometimes a grant comes out of it, like, lots of different things, but using my platform to basically get feedback to promote other people has, like, really been, like, some of the sort of secret sauce to what I've been doing.
00:07:12.718 - 00:07:44.956, Speaker B: And again, it's, it's just trial and error. And, and so far it worked, and it doesn't work without the sort of community. And, like, I can't tell you when that pivotal moment was, but at some point in time, my sort of, my sort of presence became like, hey, if I build a cool thing, chase is gonna share it. And then it just became this sort of, like, this thing, like, build it, share it, build it, share it. And then, like, and here we are today. I mean, there's obviously a lot in between there, but it was an interesting.
00:07:45.028 - 00:08:34.386, Speaker A: Growth situation and honestly, well, kind of slow, but then all of a sudden, very fast. Maybe one thing. And I think that's a perfect segue to kind of start off the conversation. Solana was kind of, well, and still is taking like, a very different approach than most blockchains. A lot of the other layer one blockchains today have copied and pasted the Ethereum virtual machine where Solana created an entirely new technology. At the time, it kind of looked like a drawback, was not adopting some of those developer tools and ecosystem of Ethereum. But I think in hindsight now, it looks like a bonus because Solana ultimately bootstrapped its entire, uh, community by itself.
00:08:34.386 - 00:08:45.150, Speaker A: Could you talk about, um, that bootstrapping process and how Solana was able to, and you and the team were ultimately able to onboard devs and engineers into the ecosystem?
00:08:45.890 - 00:09:13.114, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I. I think first and foremost, like, it started in the early days. So whenever I started and predating that, the only thing that existed was, like, the core documentation. It was written before I joined, like, three or four years ago, by the core engineers. I think one of the co founders, Greg, who many might not know his name, but they were very meaty. There wasn't a whole lot of implementation detail.
00:09:13.114 - 00:09:45.080, Speaker B: It's like, here's this big, massive paragraphs of this programming model, and that's what existed. And then the real initial bootstrapping for the Daffy's and I, the Armani's, they hung out in discord. Solana was small. You got access to the core engineers. You still kind of do today. And they sort of, like, started building out these things. Armani was obviously building serum and solit and all these different, like, the wallets and the Dexs.
00:09:45.080 - 00:10:26.540, Speaker B: And, like, that was actually probably the most powerful thing we had in the early days was that Armani was building fully in the open, open source. All wallets initially that exist today came from that sort of genesis of solit that Armani had put together. Dexs, same thing from serum, Dex. Just all these things started. So whenever I joined, that was sort of picking up steam. The only way to learn was to look at code tests to see how these things are actually operating or look at reference examples from open source. And there wasn't really a ton at the time, so whenever I joined at kin, the demand was low.
00:10:26.540 - 00:11:07.790, Speaker B: So I was seeking developers. When I came to Solana, there was just this massive pool of engineers wanting to learn to build on Solana. But, like, again, unless you just really knew how to figure it out and were, like, pretty strong senior engineer, it was really hard. The other thing that came around that time, early days, was Paulek's escrow tutorial called the Solana Bible. In some circles, it was basically this tutorial on how to build an escrow program. And, like, it served as, like, one of, like, almost the only pieces of content outside the core docs and Armani's open source code when I joined, so I was starting from scratch. I had experience looking for devs, working with the SDK.
00:11:07.790 - 00:11:25.774, Speaker B: Now I have this massive demand zero content that sort of exists in the world. So, I mean, like, I was going to say, like, shortcut this, but I'm going to kind of describe the process because I think it's kind of interesting how it all came to fruition and, like, where it is today basically just went, oh, go ahead.
00:11:25.902 - 00:11:54.640, Speaker A: No, I definitely agree. I think today kind of the playbook is copying the Solana model and kind of rebuilding especially kind of these newer ecosystems with their new virtual machines, having to bootstrap that and not really relying on the Ethereum community and Ethereum virtual machine. Solana, I think, really wrote the playbook on how to create a kind of very engaged and exciting community on the user side, but also on the engineering side as well.
00:11:55.220 - 00:12:37.054, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So just kind of like, circling back, whenever I started, I was like, what the hell do I do? So I just hung out in discord and watched developers. I watched the ones asking questions, the ones saying, how the hell do I do this? Then I watched the other ones in there being like, hey, I can help you with that. And then what I started doing is just started cold dming these people and being like, hey, what's your, why are you helping everybody? What's your intention? Like, whatever. And then eventually started building a discord of all these people and then, like, putting them in the same room and like, just being like, hey, do you guys want to help out? Like, do you, like, can you please help me? I can't just, like, do this on my own. Like, one man cannot write all the content for this stuff. And everybody was like, hell yeah.
00:12:37.054 - 00:12:59.434, Speaker B: Like, we love tech. We're nerds. We'll do whatever. And, like, people started writing content. Like, initially I met some really good people. Two of my dev or two of the Devrel, Jacob Creech, who's now the Devrel lead, Donnie Solana, who's a little bit lesser known. He's kind of just like our, like, out in the field guy, and then Colin, who's also Devrel.
00:12:59.434 - 00:13:34.622, Speaker B: All of these people came literally from me. Sort of like being like, who wants to be part of this thing? I put out a type form. People filled it out, I brought them into the channels. They started just like really going above and beyond what I would have expected and then eventually started just hiring them. Once I got approval, they're like, okay, chase, we see the value of Devrel. Let's start hiring some of these guys. And then out of that same program, unfortunately, I didn't have the approval to hire these guys, but Brian frio at Phantom slipped out of my fingers and went over to that side.
00:13:34.622 - 00:14:16.924, Speaker B: Loris from Metaplex. These guys all came out of this random, like, program that I had put together, just pulled it out of my ass, basically, and it just ended up working. And then, like, we have check for word cell club, he was also part of that. And all the, I'm not even really taking credit. Like, I just, like, all the people were just so insanely passionate and curious about Solana that they just wanted to be part of it. And once all those guys got in the same room and started doing support, then Jacob started running the Solana cookbook, and then people started contributing to that, and then Superteam came out of nowhere, and then they started contributing. And then the next thing you know, it's just this flywheel of content gets generated.
00:14:16.924 - 00:14:53.566, Speaker B: I'm sharing it, trying to, like, capture it and put it in a file and just like, sharing it or making tweet threads or creating developer lists on Twitter so that the new guy who comes into Solana can just follow my Solana developers Twitter list and doesn't have to, like, ask everybody, who do I follow? You just follow this list, and now you have Armani and the whole Rolodex of Solana devs. So it was a huge mess, but it all worked out. And now, like, looking back into that, like, as of today, where we are now, all these tools that were built and all that stuff, it's like mind boggling. It feels like a decade ago. It was like a year and a.
00:14:53.568 - 00:15:18.310, Speaker A: Half ago, definitely now. It's amazing how quickly the time has gone. It was funny. Even I attended breakpoint last year, and after the conference I met some prominent VC's in the space. And at that point in time, they're like, I really don't understand the Solana community. It seems like a lot of hype. And I was like, well, did you go to any of the hacker houses? And they're like, no.
00:15:18.310 - 00:16:04.810, Speaker A: They ultimately just kind of went to the different parties and events. And I was like, I met so many amazing builders. The energy was electric. Everybody was kind of excited about the new capabilities that Solana unlocked and it really was just amazing to kind of watch the ecosystem flourish there and even just meet people in person. Um, what would you kind of attribute, kind of really the electric energy, uh, that was kind of captured at breakpoint and I think ultimately kind of spurring off, like, even some of the more nfts and just really the organic community that developed around Solana ecosystem. Do you think it was the technology or ultimately kind of some of these earlier things of just, like, getting the correct people in the same room and making magic happen?
00:16:05.350 - 00:16:54.450, Speaker B: I think it all really started with anatoly and Raj. They were very vocal sort of thought leaders. And, like, I. This is kind of cringe to say, but, like, the vibes in the Solana community, and I hear it all the time, like, whenever I was doing my I'm chewing glass podcast, like, TJ Littlejohn from Mountain pay, he was like, listen, I came here because, like, Barrett from Cypher protocol had told him about it, but once he got there, like, you just. This energy had been building up even prior to breakpoint. Tolle and Raj sort of set this sort of tone. Like, they joke around, like, but, like, it's always, like, be a good person and, like, welcome people in and try to help everybody and, like, and other blockchains, and I'm not going to name any names, but it's like, there's a lot of sort of intellectual sort of conversations where you feel like you're not allowed to participate.
00:16:54.450 - 00:17:15.662, Speaker B: And, like, Solana just came in and be like, you ship a program, a hello, world, and everybody's like, fuck, yeah. And, like, that sort of energy just built up. And then, like, then I started getting a little more vocal on Twitter as well. And I'm like, okay, I want to sort of, like, model what these guys are doing. Like, everybody's in, like, let's all sort of, like. Like, do this stuff together. We don't want to.
00:17:15.662 - 00:17:44.104, Speaker B: We don't make fun of anybody if they don't know how to build. And, like, that, that sort of just momentum of that build up, more people came in, more people saw that. More people stayed like rust. If it wasn't for that vibe and that energy, Rust could have been sort of a blocker. Maybe not some of the bigger protocols, but some of the smaller ones that eventually became big. They might have disappeared if they didn't have that sort of community support that just, like, I can't point to. I really don't think you can point to a specific moment.
00:17:44.104 - 00:18:04.688, Speaker B: I think it had a lot to do with the right people and, like, Armani being outside of a lot of people being one of those sort of core, like, every blockchain needs a champion, and Solana had multiple champions, and I think people saw that and then inspired them. And I think that's really what started it all.
00:18:04.824 - 00:18:54.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. And, I mean, even there was kind of a relentless amount of FUD in the beginning, kind of saying Solana was not going to make it and all these things, but it was really that core group and even Kyle from multicoin kind of championing Solana, and it was amazing just to watch. And then as I personally kind of dug deeper into the ecosystem, I was blown away by the tech and what Anatolia and the team were building. It really blew me away. And it was just kind of fantastic to kind of watch the ecosystem continue to develop. And then ultimately, once kind of Solana summer started happening with all the nfts and really kind of, like, hit the growth spurt, it was super exciting to watch.
00:18:55.060 - 00:19:57.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I do want to kind of make a note on that. So, like, this is, I think about this occasionally, I won't say all the time, but Bartosz and Jordan, who I'm sure you know, who, like, basically just, like, were the biggest contributors to the Metaplex standard, I think 2021, before Solana had really, like, blown up bitcoin, Miami was happening, and those guys, like, stayed up for, like, 48 hours just to build that metaplex standard and, like, ship it. If they hadn't done that and, like, they literally, there's probably historical tweets of these guys, like, literally not sleeping for, like, weeks at a time and just getting that right without launch, it might have happened. But if they had not done that and, like, those are some names as also some very vocal leaders that also helped with that. They were also the initial inspiration and creators of the very first hacker house at breakpoint. But if they had not done that Metaplex standard, they had not created that. Um, we miss out on all of the NFT, like, that whole trajectory.
00:19:57.974 - 00:20:26.494, Speaker B: Yeah, they hadn't done that. I don't know if we'd miss out on all of it, but I think we would be way far behind where we are today because that came out of their brains. Maybe not everybody. There might not have been another Bartosh and Jordan on the sidelines at that moment to create that. And because they were there to create it, we just. And the market was obviously going insane. NFts were starting to pick up heat, and then they create that, and then it was just, like, straight, like, like, the gen apes went out.
00:20:26.494 - 00:20:46.480, Speaker B: I actually purchased like seven SMBs because the mint was not even, like, very hyped up. I mean, I think I did this over the course of multiple hours. I sold them all for less than ten soul, by the way. It was probably like, that's when I. Then I saw that go up, and that's probably when I learned, shit, man. Nfts might be a thing.
00:20:46.600 - 00:21:19.520, Speaker A: Yeah, it was funny. My co founder in the fund, he also, one of his first mints on Solana was the Solana monkey business. And he talks about how the mint ultimately was not hyped and there wasn't even a marketplace. And ultimately you could slowly mint. He said he went back on a walk, or went for a walk, and then came back and kept minting. A couple hours later, some more monkeys. And, yeah, it's crazy at the early time, just kind of being involved in the community and being at the right place.
00:21:19.520 - 00:21:58.210, Speaker A: There was a lot of opportunities, and there still are today, I think, which I'm super excited about, maybe kind of transitioning a little bit. Obviously, the Solana ecosystem went through unprecedented growth in terms of the network and network stability that kind of being pushed to its limits, along with ultimately just kind of that entire kind of ecosystem from the users and nfts, all just hitting crazy growth. How would you describe the Solana ecosystem today and kind of how it stands, kind of, in your words?
00:21:59.550 - 00:22:56.912, Speaker B: Yes. So as it stands today, I mean, obviously we're in a bear market right now. Like Solana, like we were the new kids on the block for a while, but that sort of trajectory only lasts for, I mean, it comes in waves, right? Like these sorts of things. And, and obviously, there's, there's some, there's some new things around. And I think the whole state of things is that defi kind of, and I see it a lot DeFi on Solana, and just the space in general sort of took a back seat to nfts because nfts gave access and abilities to people to just sort of speculate on pictures instead of, like, having to learn how to read these charts. And it, like, allowed people that were probably lost a ton of money trying to trade coins, the ability to kind of get in front of mints and be able to actually make money. The current state of things right now, I mean, we might as well just bring it up.
00:22:56.912 - 00:23:24.780, Speaker B: Like the royalties thing. It's sort of like an unfolding fortunate situation, but it's progressing very rapidly in terms of, like, where it was from the first conversation about it to like, where it is now, people trying to solve this. Can we solve this? Will we solve this? Of course. Of course we'll solve it. Who knows what that final answer will be? But I do. If we're being honest. It's like, it's caused some, like, clear division in the community, and, like, that's never a good thing.
00:23:24.780 - 00:24:00.144, Speaker B: But whenever these sorts of things happen and there's, like, some sort of stress or some sort of just build up, blow off the top, like, shitty situation, it's really just like, a chance for, like, a rebirth of something, and there's. There's totally. Whether royalties is the thing or something else is the thing, there will be a monetization model. My personal opinion, and I'll just, like, don't want to get too deep into the royalty stuff, but my personal feeling is that we need to protect the creators. Like, I'm talking, like, one. Like, the big mints, that's a different thing. They're raising a ton of money off of that.
00:24:00.144 - 00:24:19.044, Speaker B: I'm not saying they don't deserve royalties. I'm just saying that my sort of passion, like, I actually. I'm somewhat of an artist. I do. I do photography. I did it professionally for a few years, so I know what it's like to do that sort of thing. And if we lose the creators and, like, that was the whole pitch in the beginning.
00:24:19.044 - 00:24:38.636, Speaker B: Like, this enables creators to make a living in web3. And now we're saying, just kidding. But that's nobody's. That's not one person's decision. That's sort of everybody's decision. If I want to pay royalties to an artist, I can just go to a marketplace and sell on that marketplace that pays royalties. It is a personal choice.
00:24:38.636 - 00:25:02.572, Speaker B: I do think that there's still a lot of conversations to have, but I think it will all get solved. Just gonna take some time. But right now, it does feel like there's some sort of, like, downward pressure on the community, and, like, people. There's a. Royalties markets down. People were pissed. I'm starting to see people act out in ways that.
00:25:02.572 - 00:25:19.970, Speaker B: That I've never really seen before. Like, even, like, from 2017, maybe because I'm more plugged in now, but, like, you're seeing some, like, out of control sort of outbursts and attacks, and a lot of them are just absolutely ridiculous. And, like, it's a. It has a big impact on everything.
00:25:20.350 - 00:25:36.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. I think. I mean, some of the stuff with, like, the royalties can definitely. I mean, right now are front and center, and the Solana community. But, yeah, they're more so. I mean, bear markets are bear markets, and things can get ugly. But no, it's.
00:25:36.254 - 00:26:08.914, Speaker A: I'm personally kind of excited for, I mean, even the kind of the metaplex kind of announcing something recently about kind of continuing to enforce royalties, whatever technology solution metaplex or anybody comes up with. I, too am continuing or excited about kind of the continued support of creators and making sure that, like, the creators and the builders and the ecosystems are ultimately kind of rewarded for their talents and what they add to the ecosystem. I'm excited about that. Continuing to progress.
00:26:09.112 - 00:26:39.762, Speaker B: Yeah, there's sort of this, this thought that popped into my head. I saw the metaplex stuff. They're sort of like, they created the standard. That's what everybody uses. But there's still a large group of people that thinks that royalty is not the right answer and, like, those sorts of situations. And I don't know if it'll happen, but, like, that standard is not necessarily owned, that standard is adopted. And if metaplex does this, which they will, and I think it's a good step to see what happens.
00:26:39.762 - 00:27:03.436, Speaker B: A competing standard could emerge out of nowhere and somebody said, hey, we don't agree. Now we're going to go and, like, there's this. But this is how, this is how we progress. This is how we sort of move forward in the space is to have these debates and to, like, have competing protocols and competing standards, because ultimately the market decides which one's better and, like, that's good for everybody.
00:27:03.618 - 00:27:42.454, Speaker A: So, yeah, I fully agree. It's interesting to kind of see different people optimizing for different things, even on, like, the base layer kind of across the different communities. I always say, I think they all work. It's just what you're optimizing for. And if you're optimizing for the correct thing. I'm personally just super excited because I think Solana has optimized for the correct things. And it's cool just to continue to watch kind of the overall growth of the ecosystem and even kind of going through some of these kind of maturing kind of maturing and taking these steps forward.
00:27:42.454 - 00:27:58.850, Speaker A: I think Solana, just because it is pushing the technical aspects along with the community aspects, they're kind of now the leaders in the space and kind of going through a lot of these early problems first. And I think other communities will probably end up in similar regards.
00:27:59.670 - 00:28:39.530, Speaker B: Yeah. And one thing that's obviously noticeable is like, this sort of vocal few, the loudest ones with the big accounts aren't always the ones that should be representing, like, the people. They're just the loudest. And it causes some problems because as an outsider looking in, you see all these things and you're like, but you go to breakpoint and you see all these debates on Twitter. You go to breakpoint and you sit down and have a conversation face to face with somebody you agree on, like, a lot more than you would imagine just by, like, seeing these Personas on Twitter. And a lot of times it's a larp. People are trying to engagement for them and, like, doing whatever, but it's just people get bored.
00:28:39.530 - 00:29:16.670, Speaker B: Sometimes they're bored. Sometimes they just want to piss people off and they just start tweeting and, like, it just, like, sets fires off and it, like, it impacts people. Like, it can really, like, hurt people that think that that's real. So there's so many things that. But the funny thing is, is we're trying to build this new sort of world and crypto and all this stuff. Now we're seeing what it's like to actually build this, like, all the, all the sort of, what do you call them, empires in the world that tried to build and solve the same problem, and they all end up failing or all. You always end up having the same sorts of problems, like, it's, like, by the book.
00:29:16.790 - 00:29:48.120, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it is funny. But I appreciate you and the Solana team kind of helping navigate these waters and even during kind of the more tumultuous times, such as now kind of being kind of that shining light for the community and definitely agree and can kind of echo the statements about being in person. That's why I'm so excited for this upcoming kind of breakpoint event that Solana's hosting is getting the community together and really kind of rallying around, continuing on, pushing the space forward.
00:29:48.580 - 00:30:19.142, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be exciting. It's going to be exhausting. Like, I already am exhausted just thinking about it again in a good way. Like, last year was amazing. Also, last year was coming out of COVID Nobody in the ecosystem had ever met each other, so there was an additional layer of just like, holy shit, I get to meet Armani and all these different people. And we all did, and we all had a really good time. And people had a really, really good time.
00:30:19.326 - 00:30:30.518, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I truly, I've been to a couple conferences now, and I I think Solana has the best ones and so very excited and kind of looking forward to that.
00:30:30.694 - 00:30:45.662, Speaker B: Well, now we have Ellie, who runs the hacker houses on, on staff. So expect this to be a little bit, like. Like, a little bit higher. Like, a little bit more. Last year was amazing, but, like, Ellie knows how to do it up.
00:30:45.766 - 00:30:54.978, Speaker A: No? Yeah. And I definitely recommend checking out the hacker houses. The hacker house, actually, you're hosting one prior to the breakpoint event, I think.
00:30:55.154 - 00:31:00.322, Speaker B: The one year anniversary of the very first one that was only plastic tables and monitors. Yes.
00:31:00.386 - 00:31:20.346, Speaker A: Really? That's amazing. I mean, I've been to a few now, and just seeing the production of going from plastic tables to where they're at now is very impressive. And honestly, I think by enabling those and kind of the Solana ecosystem, supporting those has really helped bootstrap the engineers and get everybody excited about the projects as well.
00:31:20.538 - 00:31:52.032, Speaker B: Yeah, there's also this sort of engineers come there to learn, but also existing projects come there to look for engineers, and also people come there to look for partnerships. And it's also this, like, super incredible brand builder where, like, just come in there and raising a ton of awareness about Solana. And you come into markets that have never heard about it. They get students, and everybody else gets the opportunity to funnel in there and be like, holy shit, I want to be part of this. And then, like, next thing you know, they go home and they're, like, reading a Solana cookbook and, like, showing up to the next one.
00:31:52.216 - 00:32:33.170, Speaker A: Yeah, no, they. They're definitely vital, and, I mean, I get enthusiast very enthusiastic every time I go as well. So you guys are definitely doing something right. Kind of continuing on the state of the Solana ecosystem outside of, like, the marketplaces and some of the dramas unfolding there. Could you talk about not Solana's downtime per se, but, like, what the work that, like, the jump team is doing, building a second client, what ultimately fire dancer will enable, and hopefully by having a second client, ultimately kind of having more reliable uptime as well.
00:32:33.870 - 00:33:00.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, I know you just had buffalo on here, so, like, you're going to hear some very low iq answers to this, but, like, maybe that's. That's good for. For the audience who might be watching this. Like, who's coming here to watch me, but, yeah, so fire dancer, like, initially, whenever I found out about fire dancer, I was like, holy shit, this is cool. Like, here comes a second client. Also, I think they're shooting for, like, a thousand gigabit on these things.
00:33:00.922 - 00:33:03.270, Speaker A: Ten gigabit, I think, is target.
00:33:03.890 - 00:33:05.202, Speaker B: It was 1010.
00:33:05.266 - 00:33:15.068, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think turbine, the goal was one gigabit. I could be mistaken, but I think they're shooting for ten. A thousand would be wild. That'd be like 1 tb.
00:33:15.124 - 00:34:05.220, Speaker B: So, yeah, yeah, I'm just to be clear, I'm, like, like, pretty far removed from that world. But at the end of the day, like, the whole thing that this is enabling is having a second client's good for one reason. Like, jump. Building this in a silo without having to worry about production issues allows them to basically take what, what, like, the Solana core protocol is, learn the lessons, build this thing without having to worry about shipping a production bug, move very rapidly, solve problems, and then, like, not even have to, like, when Solana was being built. Like, obviously you're on a time crunch to ship a protocol because, like, there's investors involved, there's all these different things. Jump doesn't have that. Jump has, like, all the time that they need to solve the problem to hit that ten gigabit.
00:34:05.220 - 00:34:42.788, Speaker B: And what that enables, like, outside of, like, the network side of it, is it enables us to build this brand new, streamlined product and client. And then also on top of that, the actual Solana core protocol can then go look at what they did and then backport some of that stuff into their own client and then essentially make that better. But obviously, having. We've all seen the network downtime, it's a pain in the ass. It sucks really bad. But, like, if you watch and listen to Anatoly, like, no other blockchain is shipping as fast as Solana. Ship fast and break things.
00:34:42.788 - 00:34:58.054, Speaker B: Like, definitely sucks. It gives us a really horrible perception. People use that against Solana all the time on attacks. If you look at the real uptime, I think generally, if you just frame this as it's like, what is it, 99.7% or something like that.
00:34:58.252 - 00:35:09.802, Speaker A: I always laugh at that too. I'm like, if you actually look at the metrics, it's got pretty impressive uptime and doing more transaction throughput than all other EVM chains combined. So I don't know.
00:35:09.826 - 00:35:30.220, Speaker B: Well, looking at it yesterday, I shared a tweet. Like, Solana was humming along at average, 4700 transactions per second. And people would be like, oh, well, the real TPS, that's votes. It doesn't matter. Solana is still pumping through 4700 transactions a second. Votes or not votes, doesn't matter. Like, that's still holy shit speed right now.
00:35:30.220 - 00:36:27.850, Speaker B: And the jump stuff will, like, hopefully make that even better. But these, yeah, the downtime has sucked. The perception is like, Solana goes down all the time, but at the end of the day, you have having these problems uncovered now getting spammed on the network and having all these issues or finding a consensus bug. It's better that than whenever you hit 1 billion users on a blockchain, because if 1 billion users get locked out for 12 hours, you're going to have a bad day. And then again, the obvious sort of stuff here related to that downtime is that if you have two clients running and there's a consensus bug on one, the other one continue running, because it likely does not have the same bug, and you don't get that downtime, it increases your chances of not going down. If you have two separate clients, essentially.
00:36:29.190 - 00:37:07.750, Speaker A: I think you put that beautifully and super excited. Just with the recent updates Solana has been doing and watching all the exciting optimizations and then continued performance that Solana has been doing has been impressive to see. And maybe on jumping off that, could you kind of talk about. So there's two, and correct me if I'm wrong on those two main parts of the Solana team, the Solana labs team and the Solana foundation, could you talk about each of those and kind of their role in the ecosystem and what they're trying to advance for the Solana?
00:37:08.410 - 00:37:28.786, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I mean, like, this is this Washington? This is super unclear to everybody. There's actually three, like, we're going to throw in Solana Ventures into that, which is, like, the investment arm of the company. So just know. Solana Ventures is essentially just a VC company. Their job is to invest and make a profit. They invest in ecosystem projects that come out of the hackathon hacker houses and all that stuff.
00:37:28.786 - 00:38:21.948, Speaker B: But going back to labs. So Solana Labs initially was meant to just be the dev shop, one contributor to the core protocol of the Solana ecosystem. And then more recently, like, Solana Labs and Foundation are like, there's a hard split there where, like, labs is the core engineers working on the protocol, as well as potential for profit businesses or products. Solanapay realms, which is the Dao stuff saga, and a lot of different things like this. There'll probably be more, but these are like, things that could potentially, a lot of people don't know this, but Metaplex was like, obviously, said Bartosz and Jordan built that. That was like, okay, we think this is probably its own thing. And then it got spun out into its own company.
00:38:21.948 - 00:38:57.578, Speaker B: And I think, and I, like, I might be not completely right about this, but any of those sort of, like, products or potential businesses that are sort of incubated within labs have the opportunity to potentially spin out into their own sort of thing. So potentially for profit products and core protocol engineers. That's Solana Labs. Solana foundation, on the other hand, is like, this is where the treasury lives. This is where things like, obviously we're trying to get more validators. There's validator programs decentralizing the network. Then you have the, and that's like furthering the network.
00:38:57.578 - 00:39:58.936, Speaker B: Then you have the other side of, like, furthering the ecosystem. Developer relations, hacker houses, hackathons, marketing, communications, the whole messaging, the whole narrative side, the whole, the on the ground groups that are out there, like the BD teams that are the partnership engineering teams that are out there working, like, just like trying to, let's call it, level up the ecosystem, push it forward, level it up. Like, obviously deploying some sort of capital via grants to create. And just, by the way, like, our grant program, it's a lot different than a lot of grant programs for other chains. Like, hey, we'll, and I was watching your podcast with, why is that name slipping me? Oh, Joe McCann. And he was talking about, like, a lot of these blockchains are deploying capital to go build a product. And who knows how well that works? Who knows how often it works.
00:39:58.936 - 00:40:32.546, Speaker B: Solana foundation is more like related to, you want to write some open source code that bootstraps the ecosystem that everybody could use as sort of, some sort of reference implementation to innovate quicker. For me, I spend a lot of my time on educational grants, working with third party companies around the world that like, hey, we want to teach Solana. I'm like, hey, we created all this sTuff. I'll hand it over to you, help you learn how to teach it, and then you go and teach it. So, like, that's the sort of, that's foundation is doing things like that, things that help everybody, not things that are, like, helping a few people to, like, build their own product.
00:40:32.698 - 00:41:17.456, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think that's beautiful. I think ultimately that's the correct approach. We've kind of seen a lot of mercenary in some communities and some ecosystems on the grant side. But by building or incentivizing the correct infrastructure to be built that can be used by the entire community, I do think I much more advantageous. And so it's definitely, I think one of the, I mean, I personally worked at Tesla, and one of the things why I wanted to join Tesla is because I always thought every kind of decision that they've made was very unique at the time. And I kind of, it was hard for me to, like, wrap my head around how many choices they made. And ultimately, I thought those were the correct choices over and over again.
00:41:17.456 - 00:41:38.012, Speaker A: And I think what's been impressive to me and watching the Solana foundation and Solana labs team is that, again, I see that similar pattern where they continue to kind of take the craft approach time and time again to incentivize and kind of overall grow the entire ecosystem. So it's definitely exciting to watch, and I appreciate you breaking it down.
00:41:38.196 - 00:42:37.994, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's another element to this, and it's an important one that I don't think a lot of people really talk about. Like, and I've said it on some podcasts before, but I really, the goal of the foundation is to not exist. And, like, you're like, why would you ever work for, like, an organization that says you're not going to have a job in five to ten years? Like, what's the purpose of that? Well, I mean, like, if we do our job correctly, then, like, we'll be fine, but, like, but what's that mean? How does the foundation, like, put itself out of a job? And, like, I'll give, I'll just cite off a couple examples, like UC groups like super team. Super team is this group out of India. They basically created their own sort of, like they initially had in a grant from the Solana foundation. Like, they found ways to sort of, like, they create supply and demand side, like the job side of, like, the ecosystem, the developer side, matching them using, like, earn dot super team, dot fun. They build this growth, this own community.
00:42:37.994 - 00:43:46.738, Speaker B: They have their own sort of grants program. And like, really the philosophy here is what does a blockchain foundation need to do? Do you want to scale to 1000 headcount and try to basically operate as a web two company, or do you want to take a different approach here where you actually try to identify these groups that are emerging? Like, for example, mountain Dow super teamdao, Medicamp, which is now in Singapore. They launched a physical location there with support from the Solana foundation to basically find a self sustainable path to educating, educating, incubating, and running their own, what I would call miniature Solana foundation. And if you do this right and you do it well, and you basically just hand over playbooks to these different teams, you find the right team. Like Super Team Vietnam just launched, you're probably going to see a lot more of that because you find these groups, you find the right leadership, you find the right sort of developer side, the right sort of like potentially monetization models. There's a ton of monetization models within these things. There's VC's who might want to give these groups money to get access to the developers they're producing.
00:43:46.738 - 00:44:20.416, Speaker B: There's incubating projects and potentially taking token allocations. And if you look, these are just random examples. We don't know what's ever going to work. But ultimately, here's this huge pie that is the Solana foundation. And then every time you locate one of those groups, this one shrinks that one gets, and you basically peel off a piece of that and put it over there until all of a sudden, you have this decentralized network of Solana foundations that are operating autonomously. And then, like, one day, Solana foundation is only, like, this big, and then you step away and, like, the whole thing just runs itself.
00:44:20.608 - 00:44:21.224, Speaker A: Beautiful.
00:44:21.312 - 00:44:46.312, Speaker B: Obviously pie in the sky here. But, like, this is like, it's a mental model that a lot of people coming, even in Solana foundation, have a hard time wrapping their minds around. And probably one of the hardest pieces of this to really figure out how to offload would be, like, BD or, like, partner engineering. But if you teach those sort of miniature Solana foundations how to do that, and they have some bootstrap funds, then it's possible.
00:44:46.456 - 00:45:32.150, Speaker A: So I definitely love the model and love the aspiration. One thing that you said in there was kind of figuring out which things to identify and then ultimately kind of pouring gasoline on the fire per se with those and trying to have them hit the ground running. But on the flip side of that was kind of scaling Solana with a smaller headcount. And I think Solana and kind of taking the web3 native approach, like you said, versus, like, web two, and scaling to thousands of people. I think today, people don't realize how small the Solana team is, still more holistically. Could you talk about scaling and kind of all the explosive growth that Solana had with, like, relatively few people inside the internal Solana teams?
00:45:32.570 - 00:46:11.928, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, a lot of this played by a lot of this parts played by the community, a lot of it is really just about inspiring somebody to build something or do something, and then, like, granting them some funds with some milestones to get that done. So, like, scale. Like, for me, I do a lot of educational grants where I work with these third party companies. Devrel is, like, the team that Jacob's running right now. It's only Jacob plus three other people. And, like, there's hacker houses, there's hackathons. We're doing stuff on universities, we're doing all these sorts of things in that area and impacting hundreds to thousands of developers with three people.
00:46:11.928 - 00:47:06.642, Speaker B: How do you do that? You build that base layer, education and all the things that they need, and then you curate the things that community created, like the community content, the community tools, you put that all in one place. And when a third party wants to teach it to, like, let's say, somewhere in Africa, you're, like, packaged up in a pretty little bow. Here's everything you need to do. All you need is to find a teacher to teach it, hand that over to that group, and then that group teaches it to their 100, 200, 300, 500 students. And then if they do a really good job of that, then tying this back into the foundation model, maybe we're like, okay, you did a really good job. Would you like to be super team Africa or whatever that might be? So again, starting with the day one of my job to, like, thinking about myself and how to scale myself to now thinking about how to scale the Solana foundation. Like that model, I don't think a lot of people follow this model.
00:47:06.642 - 00:47:23.990, Speaker B: I don't think a lot of people know how to follow this model, because default is like, I want to own the thing. I need to do the thing myself. I want credit for it. But, like, one thing we talk about in the company is, like, give the win away to somebody else. Like, just, like, give the win away because it feels just as good. You don't have to make it public.
00:47:24.530 - 00:48:17.130, Speaker A: Definitely. No, I totally agree. And again, I think you personally and the Solana team have done a fantastic job of that, and it's been just fun and extremely impressive just to follow along with everything that you guys have been doing and how much you have got done and just this past year, since last breakpoint. So it's really been fun to watch kind of transitioning a little bit. I think, as you said earlier, Solana was at one point kind of the new kid on the block, but ultimately is starting to kind of mature and find its footing on the community side, on the tech side, now that there are some newer kind of ecosystems emerging, what are your kind of general thoughts? Like, does the Solana foundation think about them too much, or. I'm just curious to get your thoughts in that regard.
00:48:17.470 - 00:48:52.160, Speaker B: Solana foundation doesn't have a brain. We're individuals here. I'm just kidding. Anyways, obviously, when that happens, I remember whenever I started here thinking, you know, this sort of, this world where, like, you're the new kid on the block, only lasts so long, there was no telling when that next thing was coming or. And then, like, when it did come, there were two of them. And it's. I think it's really still too early to say, like, I'm really, like, Austin Virt, who's head of ecosystem in Aptos Labs, is a friend of mine.
00:48:52.160 - 00:49:22.660, Speaker B: Like, he was here at foundation or labs whenever I had joined the company. Like, like, we still stay in communication. I ask them questions about how everything's going over there. I think generally, like, right now, it's this new bright and shiny thing. And, like, not to say that bright and shiny thing doesn't stay bright and shiny for a very long time, but it's still really too hard to tell. Like, sweet kind of feels a little bit under the radar right now. And, like, maybe that's their sort of, like, sort of model.
00:49:22.660 - 00:50:03.804, Speaker B: And Aptos has obviously been a little bit more outwardly on the marketing side of things. Obviously, they just went live and they're doing all their NFT stuff and there's a ton and ton of hype around it, but you don't actually know until that hype slow dies down and people start digging in what works, what doesn't. But if you listen to Anatoly, and I do, he says he tweets it. He says it to us personally. He was like, don't celebrate your competitors, like, losses or, like, you know, aptos came out and it was four transactions a second. There were reasons for that. Like, the blockchain didn't break.
00:50:03.804 - 00:50:27.082, Speaker B: There was a bunch of misinformation. Don't celebrate that. You want to be constantly looking at that blockchain and being, like, in competing against the best of them. Like, imagine this blockchain is everything that it says it is. That's what you compete against. You don't sit here and, like, laugh and you don't hear and, like, that's one of the big things that comes out of, like, Anatolia and Raj's leadership. We don't.
00:50:27.082 - 00:50:56.070, Speaker B: We don't dunk. There might be occasions where people, like, say, this is a dunk. It's really not like, compared to just, like, a lot of this space. We try to take the high road in this organization and, like, ultimately aptos and sweat, it's going to just inspire Solana to just, like, do even better. You know, the whole, the whole move narrative was like, this is. This is a moat. Like, this is the next thing.
00:50:56.070 - 00:51:32.828, Speaker B: Solana has an engineer working on. On a move llvm right now or, like, compiling to llvm. I don't know how fast that'll take. If you ask Tolle he was like, it'll take nine months before this thing is barely good. I think this is quote or barely works or whatever it is, but the idea is like, move can compile down to LLVM and it'll run on Solana. And so program languages are really not the biggest draw. I mean, like, for example, Solana, somebody out of the woodwork, and this shows the strength of the community, came out and built Seahorse Lang, which is built on top of anchor.
00:51:32.828 - 00:52:31.448, Speaker B: And you can write smart contracts and python that generate the rust and the anchor for you. So I'm actually more bullish on, like, another version of that in typescript, a version of that in go to onboard these. The next generation of developers are coming out of universities. It's like it's going to be a minute before they're ready to go, but, like, they're learning Solana or learning aptos and SWE and all these programming models at the same exact time as you're learning a brand new low level language coming out of school, not even being a low level language engineer. I think the red pill was actually in the high level languages. A lot of people disagree with me about this. It's not about convincing them that python's better, typescript's better, but it's like this sort of like, gentle, like, introduce juxtaposition into the ecosystem, and then maybe eventually they'll realize, why don't I just write this straight up and move, or straight up and rust? So just to kind of like, recap, like, those chains are out here, they're good.
00:52:31.448 - 00:52:54.394, Speaker B: Solana foundation, or just everybody in general is going to, like, sort of eye them up and be like, what are they doing that we're not? Can we do that too? Like, how do we compete? Like, blockchain is not necessarily a zero sum game, but, like, we're all out here trying to be the best that we can. So you're not just going to be like, oh, well, they have that. We don't need that, but if it's really good. Yeah, we want that for sure.
00:52:54.482 - 00:53:26.898, Speaker A: No, that totally makes sense. And I think you said it beautifully. Yeah. And on the tech side, it is funny. Even if you have the best tech, it is hard to create the community aspect as well. And I think that, to me, was impressive. And a lot of people, I think, initially didn't think Solana was able to do that because it was not Ethereum or the Ethereum virtual machine compatible, but because it had its own virtual machine, but by bootstrapping, it kind of worked out better in hindsight, in my opinion.
00:53:26.898 - 00:53:38.670, Speaker A: But, yeah, it's definitely interesting to watch. I'm excited for both Aptos and Sui and to watch how they progress. But, yeah, Kusana has a couple years head start.
00:53:38.970 - 00:54:13.776, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I mean, like, at the end of the day, if those sort of leaders of those chains are like, anatolian Raj, maybe a little bit of shitpost here and there, but ultimately, like, take the high road, like, we're gonna, we're gonna have a really good time together. Like, if you ask me, like, we're talking about the next generation of blockchains with Solana, Aptos and Swe, and then there's some of these legacy things that, like, I still think the whole sort of shared state composability stuff is the better way. And, like, I know. Yeah. So I'll just.
00:54:13.808 - 00:54:54.230, Speaker A: I fully agree. I definitely agree. And I mean, that's like how we're kind of communicating to externally as well as next generation blockchains and then kind of legacy architecture. And I think because we're still so early and there's so few users and so few engineers relative to, like, the web two, we haven't really explored the limitations or even the beginning, the building blocks of composability. And so I'm excited that Solana and these other blockchains are kind of keeping composability while having the possibility of onboarding hundreds of millions of users. It's definitely what I want to see.
00:54:54.650 - 00:55:27.244, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm, like I said, some of that stuff sort of out of my lane on actually how those things work. But I do know that a lot of the solutions coming up on some of the legacy chains that are trying to solve some legacy problems, that it breaks composability. And a lot of people don't understand how important that composability actually is. So we'll see how it goes. But I'm super biased here, but I think that this generation of blockchains has the best chance. This next generation.
00:55:27.244 - 00:55:56.980, Speaker B: But there's a next next generation at some point in time. We just don't know when that comes. But I mean, theoretically, all these blockchains can probably hit the speed of light and the perfect software as close to the metal as humanly possible. So what, outside of composability, what improvements can you even do beyond that? Like, fast as hell, fast as speed of light, composable, easy to build on. Once you get beyond that, what else is there?
00:55:57.440 - 00:56:34.320, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's why I really like the kind of approach of taking or building the software that can ultimately take advantage of more modern hardware and the increasing bandwidth. Because I think both of those, if you don't do that, you're kind of staying stagnant. And I don't think staying stagnant in the world is ever good. So definitely love the approach and excited to continue to follow along and kind of like wrapping it up, kind of approaching the hour mark or so. What are maybe. What are your kind of.
00:56:34.320 - 00:57:06.060, Speaker A: I think because of the legacy architectures are having a little bit more difficulty scaling or can't do that at the base layer. Why? I think this is another misconception. Maybe you could speak to it on a high level of talking about not doing the L2 approach and ultimately what benefits that gives to the users and ultimately the engineers and not having to think about, like, multiple different environments.
00:57:08.360 - 00:57:12.384, Speaker B: I'm not sure I fully got the question there, exactly.
00:57:12.472 - 00:57:23.820, Speaker A: Just thoughts on L2s and how it helps users and how it helps engineers kind of build things in a more efficient manager because you don't have different places that you have to deploy.
00:57:25.320 - 00:58:20.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I would honestly, I'll just go ahead and say that that's definitely probably not something that, like, I have a whole lot of information on, like, personally, it's just like, just to be fully clear, like, I am just way deep in what I do right now. So, like, outside of, like, the l, like, the l one's that are coming to, like, basically try to do what Solana is doing, but, like, with their own sort of improvements and their own sort of trade offs, like, the l two world, it's pretty foreign to me, to be honest. Like, I've used some l two s. I've played around with it. I still think that ultimately, my feeling about some l two s is their job is not to be an l two. Their job is to actually capture as many users as possible and spin off as an l one. I don't know if that's spicy or not, but, like, you know, like, it feels that way to me in general.
00:58:20.600 - 00:58:21.776, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:58:21.968 - 00:58:36.032, Speaker B: And I think why? Like, the core Solana people are not the course, but the core eth people, like, don't like a lot of these l two s because they see what they're trying to do, but I don't know that for a fact, but it.
00:58:36.136 - 00:58:51.500, Speaker A: Definitely feels that way, for sure. And maybe just to wrap it up on this kind of spicy question narrative, any other spicy takes or hot hot takes that you can give the listeners to kind of wrap up the podcast?
00:58:52.840 - 00:59:50.872, Speaker B: Let me think. I don't know if I do have any super spicy takes, a lot of people say this, but I try to pull myself back and look at these things from multiple different angles. It's also part of my job to be pretty even headed around these things. I think the spiciest thing, as I would say is like, I think in 2023 that like, Solana is basically gonna, or once we start to see that sort of trajectory go up, I think Solana is probably just gonna dominate everybody because this sort of mentality and like, the way that we, Solana foundation operates, the mental model of like, how, how to scale these things. I think a lot of these other blockchains don't have the right approach around that. Like, it's like, let's hire 2000 people, and like, we're gonna, like, just crush it. But when you hire 2000 people, you know what happens.
00:59:50.872 - 01:00:21.580, Speaker B: Like, nobody, like, knows what anybody else is doing. And that leads to like, duplication of effort or just complete and total misses and then also just so many siloed conversations. We, like, Solana foundation right now is like 50, like, this foundation side is only like 50 people. And like, we still have, like, sometimes gets, have siloed information that doesn't get around. You know, you'll have that at any organization. But like going 50 to 1000, like, that just like exponentially grows. So.
01:00:22.280 - 01:00:38.610, Speaker A: No, totally. I fully agree. And then maybe last thing to just finish it off. As the head of developer ecosystems, what is kind of your words of wisdom to the developers that want to learn more about Solana or kind of get involved in the communities?
01:00:39.190 - 01:01:27.310, Speaker B: Yeah, so I have a lot of thoughts that run through my head when that comes up because there's a lot of questions around, like Devrel and Jacob and team are out there sort of like teaching people zero to one stuff. There's like, just keep an eye out for all these boot camps and programs. You're going to see a lot of these come through next year. Obviously, free code camp is building an interactive course, like a full course right now, which is going to be pretty incredible to have that exist out there. But one of the biggest challenges, I think, for a lot of people is be like, okay, I know how to build on Solana now. What? And really the way to get plugged into this ecosystem, obviously, if you can make it and it's feasible to do so, go to a hacker house and meet people. Get inspired.
01:01:27.310 - 01:02:10.786, Speaker B: Reach out to me if you have any questions or reach out to anybody on the dev rel team. Like, let's have a conversation. If you have feedback I want to know from everybody who's listening to this. I ask it on Twitter all the time, but what problems do you have to build on Solana? My goal outside of the foundation is I want to put myself out of a job quicker than Solana foundation puts themselves out of a job, because, like, the whole goal here is to, like, make Solana just so easy to build on. But, like, the whole. One thing I will point out is that once you've learned, one of the best information aggregators for jobs and opportunities right now is earn superteam fun. They're basically, like I said, supply demand side.
01:02:10.786 - 01:02:50.098, Speaker B: There's bounties, there's jobs. And, like, I find because it's the only one of its kind that exists specifically for Solana right now. I want to make sure that everybody on both sides of that, like, sort of that supply and demand side know, to go there to find people. But just another thing that I said yesterday, like, a lot of people out there know Mert from Helios Labs. He's been a very vocal leader in the space lately, and Solana specifically, and it costs you $0 to be like, mert or any of these other people. So if you go out there and you're like, I want to get plugged in. I want to be, like, part of this whole thing.
01:02:50.098 - 01:03:23.040, Speaker B: Go out there and if you're a developer, build an open source tool that everybody wants to use. Write a piece of content that people want, and then go out there and just inspire people and just, like, start. People will eventually take notice that, like, I want that guy on my team because, like, look what he's doing. Look how he communicates. Like, shitposting is cool and fun and stuff like that. But, like, I be inspiring and be a leader because we need more of those. Like, this is how it, this full circle here, talking about how this whole thing started with a few key people, like Armani and Bartosz and Jordan.
01:03:23.040 - 01:03:35.184, Speaker B: Like, that next generation of those people, some of them are starting to show face, but there's the whole, we need the full roster, and we only have a few of them. So just, like, get out there and be that person.
01:03:35.352 - 01:03:54.714, Speaker A: I love it. I think that's a perfect way to end it. Thank you so much, Chase. It really was a pleasure to get to chat with you and kind of learn everything that the Solana community has been up to and really excited again to continue to watch you personally and the Solana team continue to crush it. So thank you.
01:03:54.882 - 01:03:56.162, Speaker B: Yeah, man. Thanks, Logan.
01:03:56.266 - 01:03:56.770, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
