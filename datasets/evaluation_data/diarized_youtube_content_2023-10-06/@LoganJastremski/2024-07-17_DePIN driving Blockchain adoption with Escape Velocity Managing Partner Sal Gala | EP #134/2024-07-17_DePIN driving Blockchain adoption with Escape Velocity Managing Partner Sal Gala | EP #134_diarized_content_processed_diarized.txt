00:00:00.360 - 00:00:31.290, Speaker A: I think that. I think escape velocity and frictionless both have uniquely in common is that they have extremely tall, young time horizons. I think there's a few venture investors who are this young in their career and actually make benefit from 30, 40, 50 year bets. And for us, deepen still feels like day 0.1. It's like, yep, yes, we have maybe now 1500 companies instead of 25 when we first started, but we're not yet 0.1% of global infrastructure. It's still not even really relevant or pimple on the ass of the actual economy.
00:00:31.290 - 00:01:07.050, Speaker A: I think what we uniquely are able to do is basically say, like, hey, we're going to figure out what are the really huge markets in deepen and try to find out what's the best company in each of. Or the company has real compounding moats or has the potential to build them in each of those categories because there's no tam constraint on the amount of energy or bandwidth or transportation that humanity is going to use. These things, if you can build a better mousetrap around how to deliver them at lower cost or lower latency or more efficiently, they're all like multi trillion dollar industries.
00:01:09.110 - 00:01:15.050, Speaker B: Sal, thanks for coming on the podcast. Big admirer of what you guys are doing at escape velocity.
00:01:15.910 - 00:01:18.050, Speaker A: I appreciate it. Yeah, it's great to be on the pod today.
00:01:18.710 - 00:02:16.520, Speaker B: Where should we start? I think you have a super interesting background. You guys are doing a lot of interesting things in the fun space. You kind of remind me of our fund, where you were really early to an entire sector category, and we were just talking. You kind of feel like you're going crazy a little bit when you're so early. And ultimately the market starts to come around and start validating the thesis and that you're like, all right, maybe I'm not crazy. And I think you guys, more than anybody that I can think of in recent memory or, like, dead on about your thesis and the deep end category, I would say it's still playing out, but the market is really kind of coming around to that. And so I would love to maybe parse a part, a little bit of your background first, how you came to be in the whole crypto market, and then we'll get into deepen and escape velocity and some of your thoughts on the market.
00:02:16.860 - 00:02:55.350, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I think it's way too early to take a victory lap for deepen, but at least over the past year, people have gone open to the possibility of deepen becoming a real industry and a real powerful sector. And so, yeah, I mean, for folks listening. Like, we, we first met, maybe we're like, nine months ahead of you guys, basically, and, like, starting the fund, right? We we met maybe a year ago. Um, I remember our first conversation, like, you had this crazy conviction on, on Solana. Um, and at that point, there was this big discussion in deepen around, like, where to launch. What's the deep end chain? Or is there gonna be a deep end pacific layer one? And I remember coming out of the discussion just thinking like, shit, I just need to buy.
00:02:55.350 - 00:03:37.694, Speaker A: I don't really know if this Logan guy's right, but, like, his conviction is just infectious. Like, I need to buy some Solana right now. And we did, and it turned out well. So thank you for that. But I think we were doing the sort of similar thing with deepen since 2022 when we were raising the fund. And I think had maybe a different challenge in some ways, because deepen was sort of, like, ill defined in a way that I think high throughput chains are not. And so we had to fight also this categorization question around, like, what are we investing in? What does it, what does it mean to be deep in? What are the boundaries of it? But over time, whats become clear to the market, and what has been clear to us for a long time is that these networks take crypto, like flywheels that were used to in our world.
00:03:37.694 - 00:04:14.550, Speaker A: They grow exponentially, they grow virally, and they apply them to real world industries and basically collapse the unit economics to something where web two companies cant compete anymore. And this is applicable across a ton of sectors, mapping, energy, wireless, transportation, logistics, tracking, you name it. And yeah, I think for. I guess to give you the background story on me and how I got into crypto, the slightly uncensored version, I'll say, I guess I'm from Venezuela originally. Grew up in the States here. But Venezuela was going through a crazy period of hyperinflation when I was a teenager. Basically, like, around the time you get your first job, 15 or 16 here in the States.
00:04:14.550 - 00:04:39.628, Speaker A: I think in 2016 or 17, it was, they cut off six zeros off the currency, and the following year they cut off another five. So literally it was a eleven, like ten to the 11th power devaluation of the currency over two years. And so I got very, very bitcoin pilled as a teenager. I was like, back in the States, I turned 16, I tried to get a job at like, mcDonalds, burger King. Like, every single thing you could imagine couldnt even get a call back. So the solution, of course, was like, buy bitcoin. Sell fake ids to my friends.
00:04:39.628 - 00:04:57.270, Speaker A: That was my first job. To do that, you had to go on the Silk road. To do that, you had to walk into Walmart with $1,000 in cash, give it to the guy, send it to Mount Gox, and then pull out your bitcoin out of Mount Gox later. So that was my introduction to bitcoin. There was no, like, back then. You were just like, literally handing your wallet. There was even no secret phrase.
00:04:57.270 - 00:05:21.526, Speaker A: It was just really, really primitive times, but got me extremely bitcoin built on just the permissionless angle of crypto. Like, I fundamentally felt that I was smart enough to work a job at McDonald's. The world was telling me, no, I wasn't. And so I was like, all right, fuck it, then we're going to figure out some other way to make money. And bitcoin was a way for me to do that. And I think something similar is happening with crypto all around the world and deepens, enabling it. The first hundred million people maybe bought crypto with their own money.
00:05:21.526 - 00:05:56.506, Speaker A: And this is people like you and me here in Park Avenue in New York City, that can afford it. The next billion or multiple billion people are going to earn their crypto because they have either their labor, their time, their data, their attention, their resources that they can contribute to networks and earn. Um, and so this is the, you know, sort of like the core part of why I feel so strongly about deepen being an important category of crypto and really core to, like, the crypto ethos as a whole. But anyways, I, um, my co founder, Mahesh and I out of school. We interned together, actually, while we were still in school at Goldman Sachs downtown here in New York City. I was taking fintech companies public. He was working on insurers and banks.
00:05:56.506 - 00:06:38.780, Speaker A: We went off. We were the crypto nerds in the group that were obsessed with, this was back when Ripple was big and some other in 2018, 2019. But we went off and worked for investment firms for a couple of years. I worked for two guys called Mickey Malka and Nick Shalec at Ribbon Capital. They were one of the first funds doing crypto institutionally out of anyone, really. They were buying bitcoin in their funds in 2013 in their fund. One, they did the Coinbase Series A, and so had a really, what I felt like were some of the top investors in crypto in the private markets and took a very ill call it web two approach, not in the way that they think, but in the way that they partner with people and are extremely high conviction and long term partners and I really admire that.
00:06:38.780 - 00:07:10.626, Speaker A: I worked for them for a handful of years and we were investing heavily into crypto. First we backed a lot of the SaaS businesses, so chainalysis and fire blocks tax bit. And it turned out to be doing the series A and B's of those companies. Everyone. The traditional web two view was like, these are way too small to why do chain analysis, selling to the IR's and paying 500 million for that seemed crazy at the time and people treated us like we were crazy. But it turned out that the IR's is going to spend a lot of money like trying to track down crypto gains. And these markets were way bigger than people thought and they were able to compound for many years.
00:07:10.626 - 00:08:06.466, Speaker A: So we um, got some experience investing in those companies, investing in DeFi, investing in some of the layer ones we both mash and I like separately got obsessed with. Just like real world crypto. We basically thought, okay, we have this like crazy machine in DeFi that can take any like tiniest portion of real world like value and make it like reflexive as hell and basically just like super boost it. But we still have no actual starting real world capital or economic activity to boost this reflexivity. We got obsessed with how do we create networks with real world value and coalesce around this term? We call digital commodities, which are physical networks that are creating a token which allows you basically access to a physical commodity or service or product. It developed from there. We both were early in the helium community, thanks to our friends at multicoinous, got some of the first hotspots, and back in the last cycle we were climbing roofs.
00:08:06.466 - 00:08:30.790, Speaker A: We were involved in helium governance. We were doing all sorts of stuff around the community, basically just helping to build a network in real time. And that was a super exciting learning lesson. And we met a lot of entrepreneurs through that journey who were basically taking the primitives that they saw working in helium or in filecoin and saying, hey, we can do this for 1015 different other industries that I'm an expert in. And yeah, it all compounded from there.
00:08:31.410 - 00:09:26.510, Speaker B: It's a great story and a lot of pieces came together maybe to start parsing that apart a little bit. I think one thing that you mentioned that I really agree with is that the early Internet adopters were cypherpunks. Some of them are now just investors. But I think to your point, where majority of people probably are going to come into crypto is through doing something in the physical world, earning tokens getting rewarded tokens where they can actually get their first wallet. And then once they're in this crypto ocean, if you will, they probably won't leave. Can you talk a little bit about your thesis just around people earning tokens and being brought into the crypto ecosystem?
00:09:27.380 - 00:10:10.090, Speaker A: Yeah, it's one, it's just the observed, like, it's the observed behavior we see both in crypto and in fintech that giving people value first. And just also intuitively, like, if you give people value first, they tend to be much very, it's called retentive in the ecosystem, especially when there's no expectation of value. Right. It's different. Like airdrop farmers. Once you basically have an institutionalized industry of folks, but when people are using it for the underlying utility, I think you sort of like create this mental energy in users heads where it's like, okay, this network is what I use to do this thing, and that creates brand value and that compounds over many people and creates a network effect. And so the broader picture though, around, like, why it matters is just like public infrastructure, such shit.
00:10:10.090 - 00:11:01.130, Speaker A: Like, especially here in the US, but many places we have very, like, obviously the bureaucratic agencies that are supposed to do these things today aren't able to. And if we just look around today, I see a 5g radio next to us. We have these camera, maybe security cameras near us. There's all sorts of public infrastructure that could be improved, that I could theoretically go climb and fix that radio if I wanted to, but how would I get paid for it? What gives me the right to do that? Am I going to get arrested? All these rules around who can contribute to the actual infrastructure that everybody uses today are very opaque, and it creates all these transactional costs. That means that people can actually, can actually contribute to common public infrastructure. And so it's both a question of when you are given value and you earn through an ecosystem. It's a very empowering, from an end user perspective sort of feeling.
00:11:01.130 - 00:11:30.726, Speaker A: I think that's why I stayed in crypto for the last decade, why I think other people will too. And it's also this idea that you're contributing to something bigger than yourself, to public infrastructure. These are things that other people are going to use and get value out of. I think there's non tangible aspects to it as well that I hope that we can deliver on. When you compare the opportunity cost, being your local government regulator, deploying something, this feels much more wholesome.
00:11:30.878 - 00:13:12.590, Speaker B: It is remarkable just how professionalized airdropping became in the last six to twelve months. People are angry if they're not automatically granted tokens for really doing nothing. In most cases, occasionally they'll provide some value, but I think deep end, whether it's hivemapper helium, actually doing something in the physical world and then being rewarded for contributions to the network, to me seems like very much the first principles, correct way to actually approach this. If someone's doing something contributing at a positive value, sure they should receive potentially a little bit of value in return. To me, I think the more that I started going down this deep end rabbit hole, I really got infatuated with collapsing the capex costs because I think part of it, yes, we're bringing more people into the crypto ecosystem that is exciting, but they still have to do things and these products still have to be a meaningful improvement on kind of their web two or current existing counterparts, either from a business side or the product side. And I think potentially you can have both better products and better businesses in the long term. Can you talk about the more in depth on kind of like collapsing the capex, so to speak, on the business side and almost pushing that to kind of end consumers and rewarding them for helping contribute to those numbers?
00:13:13.250 - 00:13:48.000, Speaker A: Yeah, I think about it in two separate effects or impacts that are, they usually come together, but they're two fundamental different impacts. One is the fact that it's like the upfront costs. You don't need to maybe raise a billion, 10 billion, $100 billion to collapse to build a network. And so you're collapsing just the sort of upfront capital raising costs that you need to do. I think this is relevant for things like wireless networks. It's relevant for maybe you want to build the next large language model. And these are huge upfront capital investments.
00:13:48.000 - 00:14:50.808, Speaker A: And so this is one rationale. The second one is really around how dynamic the marketplace is, though, I guess, is how I would describe it today. If you're the way that a, uh, you know, street map gets, uh, gets uh, recorded, or maybe a telco network gets deployed, there's like a year long or maybe six month long time lapse between when somebody identifies that there's coverage needed, um, to like the licensing process, to the time that it gets the capital is raised for it, to the time that it's deployed, to the time that it's verified, to the time it's actually usable for customers, um, and deep in like collapses that which I think is much more powerful actually than collapsing like the absolute quantum of capital that we need to raise because other people have, like there's ETF's there's private equity funds, there's many vehicles by which you can raise a shit ton of money nowadays, but there's not many vehicles by which you can just create an extremely short feedback loop between supply and demand in a real world marketplace. So yeah, I think that's actually the more fundamental power behind deep end makes sense.
00:14:50.944 - 00:15:12.030, Speaker B: Part of my time at Tesla was always decrease the feedback loops as quickly as possible or increase the feedback loop so that you can iterate on the product faster because you're going to be wrong and you're going to be less wrong. And the more that you can iterate on that product feedback or user feedback, more likely that you'll get to a better end state sooner.
00:15:12.570 - 00:15:49.412, Speaker A: Yeah, people underestimate, just like, I think it's the mental model for all of life. Like just lowering latency to like the absolute bottom is the most important thing. Like I, the thing that really hit me with this insight was actually an insurance, at ribbon. We backed this insurance company in like the commercial space they were selling through brokers or whatever. But anyways, they, they had this like curve where they were the only ones able to quote commercial, a commercial cyber policy for a small business. Instantly, basically two, 3 seconds, most brokers would come back to 5 hours later at the end of the day or maybe the next day. And literally they found that if they were to give people quotes in 5 seconds, their conversion rate was 40%.
00:15:49.412 - 00:16:17.988, Speaker A: If they gave it to people in 30 seconds, it would be 10%. And if they gave people in 5 hours, it'd be two or 3%. Like that. There's the slope of this curve about like how much it matters. To just like give people an answer quickly is insane. And so, like this is for commercial cyber, for small bit, like nobody gives a fuck about that yet. And still, like, we see that consumer behavior, like really being like the dominant sort of like way by which you could completely change the economics of like a 40% funnel conversion business to 2% is an entirely different business.
00:16:17.988 - 00:16:29.090, Speaker A: Like, that's not even within the same world. And so, yeah, I think people underestimate, like what these deepen, how much different these deep end networks will be just because we're lowering that latency to the absolute bottom max.
00:16:29.210 - 00:17:06.834, Speaker B: And even on the infrastructure side of blockchains. It's funny because prior to me being at Tesla, I was at Expedia Group. And a lot of what we are also trying to do internally was measure the latency for which websites load. To your point, if the website loads in 5 seconds, versus half a second, the conversion rate is massively different. And I always thought it was funny that people were in the blockchain world are like, oh, yeah, 1010 2nd block times, 22nd block times are fine. When you need like fast confirmation you really want. If you can go to like 200 milliseconds, 100 milliseconds, like, that's a big difference.
00:17:06.834 - 00:17:09.090, Speaker B: Um, just on the architecture design.
00:17:09.170 - 00:17:24.904, Speaker A: But yeah, I actually don't even think it's a static target. Like people now, both because of mix shift, the people getting younger, and also just like, like we were just playing with the Apple vision pros, like your feedback loop of like your mind body, like whatever. Brain computer interface is crazy short there. And I think naturally younger generations are.
00:17:24.912 - 00:17:27.848, Speaker B: Just much more impatient, shorter attention span, especially with TikTok.
00:17:27.944 - 00:17:37.968, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So it's like something that is a continuously compounding mode, I think, for networks and for businesses that can just continuously optimize for lower and lower latency over time.
00:17:38.144 - 00:18:19.260, Speaker B: Fully agreed. So maybe talk a little bit about. You guys were obviously very early to deepen, uh, you and Mahesh and you guys raised a fund called escape velocity. Can you talk about kind of the overarching, I mean, fun thesis, which is deep in, but within the fund, what are you guys uniquely excited about? Because this is your core focus, your bread and butter. I think directionally, if you guys are correct, which I think you are, a lot of people will probably copy kind of the deep end thesis, so to speak. Um, but what are you uniquely excited about? Whether in your portfolio company or just in the space more broadly?
00:18:20.280 - 00:18:54.206, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. I think a lot of people take that to mean certain sectors, I guess for us, like where you think that. I think escape, lossy and frictionless both have uniquely in common, is that like, we have extremely young time horizons. I think there's few venture investors who are like this young in their career and actually make like benefit from 30, 40, 50 year bets. And like, for us, it's deepen still feels like day, like 0.1. It's like, yeah, I. Yes, we have maybe now 1500 companies instead of 25 when we first started, but we're not yet 0.1%
00:18:54.206 - 00:20:14.960, Speaker A: of global infrastructure. It's still not even really relevant or pimple on the ass of the actual economy. So I think what we uniquely are able to do is basically say, hey, we're going to figure out what are the really huge markets in deepen and try to find out what's the best company in each of or the company has like real compounding motor has the potential to build them in each of those categories, because we, like, there's no tam constraint on the amount of energy or bandwidth or like transportation, that humanity is going to use these things, if you can build a better mouse trap around how to deliver them at lower cost or lower latency, or more efficiently, they're all multi trillion dollar industries. And so unless you're deploying a maybe like multi billion dollar venture fund, which we're not, then from a TAM constraint perspective, like, all these markets are really huge. What we look for is what is a category leading network is basically our underwriting criteria in these markets that are big enough, and it's really tough at the early stage. A lot of it is founders, and you're backing teams at this point, and you're really looking for folks who can build a community and also have expertise in the sort of web two domain that they're looking for as the networks get bigger. Having been around crypto for a while, you learn what a powerful community feels like.
00:20:14.960 - 00:21:05.820, Speaker A: You see networks go through issues and recover stronger. You see the community band together and solve issues that wouldn't be possible in a centralized way, or that you just are impressed by the caliber by which these networks are able to adapt to changing real world conditions, especially in the liquid markets. We see networks going through things like these and coming out stronger on the other end. It's a really strong signal for us of like, okay, if they're able to come out of this challenge stronger. In periods of when people really want to get into the space and sort of see it, this is going to be a winning network. And so a couple of the categories that we're interested in, wireless has been a big focus for us. So we have a company working on post quantum stuff on wireless, a company working on fixed Internet, which we're co investors with you guys on andrina, we've invested heavily into pelion, which is on the mobile side, and a couple of other companies in that sector.
00:21:05.820 - 00:21:51.280, Speaker A: We have a company called Daylight that we invested in on the energy space and everything. That has to potentially be a really category leading and special network in that category. And then mapping, we think, is a very underappreciated this ability to see the world arbitrarily, at any place, from any distance, over the Internet protocol is fucking sick. And I think it's highly underestimated what kind of Use Cases that you can build on top of that. And I'd say it's not exactly clear how the pieces are going to fit together. But it's Clear that DPN is really good at collecting really Unique datasets. And if we can figure out the other piece on how to monetize really unique datasets, then I think then DPen will be ten x stronger than it is now.
00:21:51.280 - 00:22:38.080, Speaker A: But for now, we have folks doing Sidewalk robotic data and collecting really powerful data sets. We have grass collecting, scraping Reddit posts, and creating one of the, one of the highest quality datasets of, like, text data. But there is no, like, decentralized hugging face yet where we're going to upload a dataset and accrue all the economics from it yet, or like some sort of like, marketplace where that. Whereby that happens. And so if that happens, then I think, like, data assets, which have previously not been great investments, then become really, really powerful investments, because for the first time, they're able to capture the value they create and the data, like, for any, like, data or just engineering or like the deep end, you should go like, check out like, demo can get. You can today stream data from 90,000 cars across the US and get the weather data, the humidity, all sorts of cool stuff you can do. Daylight will do the same for energy.
00:22:38.080 - 00:22:50.120, Speaker A: Silencio has noise data, one of the biggest sources of noise data globally. And so, yeah, all of these things, I think, can be very powerful if we figure out the right models for them.
00:22:51.060 - 00:23:56.728, Speaker B: Yeah, I do. I think to your point, these markets are extremely large and the historical standards and crypto is still so small, and there is the opportunity to really make the product much better using the coordination method of crypto rails. One of the things that I've always appreciated about is that deepen more broadly. Yes, crypto is the coordination tool and helps facilitate transfers or payments or token transfers on the backend. That is nice. It does make the experience easier, but if you did remove it, theoretically, you could kind of like, these businesses would stand and have stamped on their own 2ft in the past. It's just that when you enable kind of this more shared ownership with the frictionless experience, it makes it much easier and they can scale much harder.
00:23:56.728 - 00:24:58.680, Speaker B: And the one thing that I've been so frustrated about with crypto is being in the industry for so long, is the lack of scale. And I've been excited by now, the infrastructure finally getting to the point where applications like Adrena can actually scale if they want to use blockchain rails or hivemapper helium, the infrastructure is now in place for these to actually hit meaningful scale from the blockchain standpoint and the blockchain standpoint is not the bottleneck, which I really appreciate, but maybe rifting off one thing that you said, I think totally agree with that. They're great on bootstrapping the supply, but historically one of the complaints about deep end or the deep end skeptics will say, look, they are great about getting a bunch of supply, but the demand's not there. What's kind of your critique or steel man on kind of the demand side of majority of these networks today?
00:24:59.540 - 00:25:55.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I actually think that the demand side, the right mental model to think about it, is that there's this trade off between how quickly you can bring demand side on and how decentralized you want to be. Like, there are deep end networks today that have a centralized gateway on top creating revenues and sort of like maybe they pass some of that onto the network, or maybe not, or maybe it's unclear how much they pass, but that exists today. You can create a business on top of Highmapper or helium and make money selling to real world businesses. I know, because we have a bunch of friends that do it. But when you start trying to decentralize more, or networks that from the first place take decentralization as a core sort of like tenant that they're not willing to sacrifice on, they find it really hard to provide the quality of service that's necessary compared to web two. For a compute network, you have these reliability issues. You have the inherent overhead of consensus mechanisms that you have to add to all these real world networks.
00:25:55.660 - 00:26:53.990, Speaker A: It has become hard, in a permissionless way, to deliver value, a solution that's full stack. We've had to have these centralized gateways come up and do the service layer. And in different networks, these gateways have been more or less powerful. We've seen this past week the main gateway behind pocket basically made a proposal to take over pocket governance for a year and have carte blanche ability to change that network the way that they want. I think the right question is how do we build revenue in a decentralized way? Meaning we either don't have the reliance on these gateways or users are coming to the protocol directly and not so much the piece on revenue broadly. And I also say we had, I think, played a role in this aspect of making deep end on chain revenue a meme. I don't know that I actually think that was maybe a mistake.
00:26:53.990 - 00:27:41.996, Speaker A: I don't think that this. We did it because we felt that we had to credentialize deepen among traditional investors to bring more capital into the space. And traditional investors would understand a chart of revenue that would go up into the right. Um, what we, I think misunderstood, though, is that inherently, like, when you track on chain revenue like this, you're like indexing on like burn and mint type mechanisms. And having one company like, make revenues and then burn a portion of those is always going to be a worse path to value accrual, or path to least value accrual than like, staking. To like, staking proportional to like, capacity that you need of the network or some other method by which you more closely align basically the top line economics with what the network actually sees. So I think the next version of this question actually is more TVL focused.
00:27:41.996 - 00:28:16.094, Speaker A: Not TVL, but because that has its own connotations around not being a great metric, but it's something around how much risk are people willing to take on to actually guarantee their participation in these networks, or their ability to use the services provided by the networks, not how many tokens are being burned. I think the revenue question is a good one. I think if we were to say, hey, you can just be completely centralized, then we would have much more revenues on deepen today. But that's not the world that we want to live in. I think actually the path that the space is on is pretty close to the right balance of trade offs between the two.
00:28:16.222 - 00:29:09.880, Speaker B: Well, I applaud you guys, because you guys push that out. Because I think for me, and where I would like to see the industry go is from purely kind of more based off memes or vibes or what everybody else calls narrative to something like cash flows. And I think that's the long term kind of maturing of the industry. It's obviously not going to happen overnight, but it would be interesting to actually see that these projects are producing something and people enjoy these products and are willing to pay for them in some form or fashion. And so if it's not necessarily like highlighting the cash flows or like the burn and mint, can you maybe go deeper into how you kind of think the next iteration of these deep end networks will be?
00:29:10.500 - 00:29:30.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I think like the 2.0 version is having everyone stake tokens, ideally proportional to how much they want to use the networks. And that's like the closest value alignment between the demand side's willingness to pay and the actual amount of locked supply that gets taken off of the market.
00:29:31.160 - 00:29:35.904, Speaker B: Why are they staking to access capacity on the network?
00:29:35.992 - 00:30:15.960, Speaker A: So basically, yeah, instead of going through a gateway, a user might stake tokens in order to do get x amount of bandwidth transfer x amount of gigabytes of data or get x amount of power through the network. I think it's been known for a long or broadly on the layer one space. Generally, if you have everyone staking in proportion to their perceived preference, which they may or may not get, that naturally is going to take a lot more tokens off the market than having one company burn tokens that they actually deliver service for. And so from first principles I just feel that it has to accrue a lot more value with these networks, which ultimately results in stronger networks that can reinvest more.
00:30:16.040 - 00:30:33.270, Speaker B: That makes sense. I haven't heard that interesting take, but it makes sense because everybody, historically, all the money and brain power has gone into just the infrastructure and this has kind of emerged as one of the best practices.
00:30:34.130 - 00:31:21.412, Speaker A: Yeah, so we'll see. But I will say on the revenue burn basis and if you want deepen into today what you see there, I think the implied yield of if you take deep in market cap or deepen revenues and divide them by the market cap, it's probably something like half a percent today, or maybe 30 50 bps, something like that, which is roughly, if you go back and look at old investor relations stuff, or telcos back in the late nineties, it's like what people were deploying towers at towers used to on day one you would deploy them and maybe you would get some service revenue from a telco and that'd be like a half percent yield. And that's like the bet was, hey, this is going to go from half a percent in the early two thousands. Now you're earning like three, four, 5% yields. You can at least make some money back. And today these things make like 30% yield. Like it's crazy.
00:31:21.412 - 00:31:42.730, Speaker A: If you can have three, four carriers on them, you can make a lot of money on towers. And so I think the bet for deep end will be that. Similarly, of course, market cap is higher today because we have this early speculation and because the networks are finding their footing in terms of their customer bases. And over time, though, the yield generation potential in terms of the actual utility of these networks is massive.
00:31:43.030 - 00:32:21.510, Speaker B: Yeah. So what do you think it will take for us to do a ten x and either deep end revenues or not so much projects, but usefulness? When will it be consensus that deep end is here to stay? Deep end projects are fucking killing it and going to ride off into the sunset, so to speak. Is it more on the demand side? Is it more supply side? Is it just getting to critical mass in some of these networks? I know, they're generalizing quite a bit because it's a huge category as a whole. But your thoughts there.
00:32:21.810 - 00:32:50.040, Speaker A: Yeah, part of me is what Deepin really needs is r1 big public benefit story, which is what helium felt like in the last cycle, where you could imagine how you can now track all the benefits that we talk about Deepin, basically. So I think the real breakout moment is just when the vast consumer audience understands the public benefit story behind how good these networks can be for the world, not just how much financial returns you can make on them.
00:32:51.340 - 00:32:55.160, Speaker B: And do you think that strictly from the product side, these are just better products?
00:32:57.220 - 00:33:30.178, Speaker A: Better products, but also greater impact? I think if we're able to get, say, over the next five years or three years, we got a billion dollars worth of solar connected to crypto networks. It's still a very small portion of the, the total corpus of solar investments in the US that's needed and it's current, but that's a signal of, hey, we're actually deploying that new capacity in something that we already know is very good for the world, and it's just coordination issues that we're holding it back before. And we solved these coordination issues with DPIN.
00:33:30.314 - 00:34:29.126, Speaker B: Yeah, it is interesting. I feel like more broadly in today's age, in 2024 of July, the hot narratives, at least from the narrative perspective, are AI and deepen. And I think there's a lot of excitement about AI in general and just what people can do with chat, GPT, and kind of the intersection of AI and crypto. But deepen, I think people can squint and see deepen will be something from the product standpoint, I don't know if it's going back to your earlier point, if they're not as long term oriented as us, just because we're earlier and have the luxury of maybe thinking longer term than most, but it's definitely will be exciting to watch over the next five to ten years and see how these networks mature.
00:34:29.318 - 00:35:12.416, Speaker A: For sure. I think a lot of the crypto people, like the people have been around crypto for a while too, will converge onto deepen. Deepen tends to trail crypto, I've found, by two to three years in terms of maturity and basically themes. We're just figuring out how to use economic security for deep end now and starting to see liquid staking and more experimentations around that which was happening in the 16, 1718, whatever phase of broader crypto. So I think we'll get these people as soon as, when it becomes clear that there's going to be real world fiat revenues coming into then crypto. People know what that means, what reflexivity. They've been trained now for many years on the effects of that.
00:35:12.416 - 00:35:32.130, Speaker A: So I think it'll be easier for them to extrapolate how powerful the networks can become. There's just these frankly correct questions now around are these actually decentralized? What rights do I get as a token holder? Are these things going to disappear and vanish? Basically you need to tie the physical component to the on chain component and get people comfortable with that.
00:35:32.290 - 00:36:32.560, Speaker B: Well, I think this debate has also been had for in the layer one, kind of in L2 infrastructure for some while about what is the correct amount of decentralization. I don't know if the market even knows today because I mean, bitcoin has like ten to 12,000 nodes. Ethereum has like on any given day, 4500 to 6500 full nodes. Solana has like 2000 to 3000 full nodes. And then the newer high throughput networks have 100 to 200, and some of them have less than 50. I think it's been interesting to me just watching this because the ethos of the early community within crypto is like, yes, this has to be super decentralized. If it's not decentralized, what are you doing? And now it's all across the spectrum of, hey, we may not be as decentralized, but maybe we're faster or better, cheaper or whatever.
00:36:32.560 - 00:36:43.760, Speaker B: What's your take on the decentralization blend within deepin? Because you said potentially you could have higher revenues today if you weren't as decentralized.
00:36:44.740 - 00:37:35.710, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like I've swung on the pendulum on this back and forth six times over my crypto career. Where I feel today is that deepen's fundamentally different in that these networks take a long time to, they're just less set in stone. I think you can't expect them to be set in stone the way that even a Defi primitive might be, and definitely not something like bitcoin might be or a layer one. What I've been advocating for, what I push for in our portfolio is token holders should have extremely strong veto rights. But besides that, I think coin voting is a complete cancer for the industry and it's a complete waste of time. And we make fun of web two company enterprises being adult babysitting shops, but crypto governance is literal adult babysitting or not even baby. I guess there's no supervisor, so it's just the fucking playground of idiots.
00:37:35.710 - 00:38:21.052, Speaker A: We should just let the teams cook. I really think if you own a token. The core team in the deep end should be able to make pretty much protocol changes, at least for a period of a year or so, without any sort of oversight from governance. Your oversight should be, you can fork the network if you need to, or maybe once a year you can revoke these rights. But I think the space arrived at this conclusion because it was first securities laws. We need everyone in the network to participate in some way, and not just be financial buyers turned or it may be just a meme. I don't know if it's actually real, and I think it's actually not, but that participating in governance is enough work to not be considered a security.
00:38:21.052 - 00:39:16.794, Speaker A: And so now let's just give everyone these really complex governance rights and give them a bunch of work that they have no need or interest in doing. I think that's completely backwards. As a liquid token holder investor fund, what makes me sleep well at night is one knowing the teams are not going to rug, which means that we have veto rights over maybe taking their tokens, or I know exactly where their tokens are on chain and what their incentives are. And we care about having transparency and sort of visibility, but not around. We don't want to vote on individual governance parameters or protocols. And I think if we chose the one team out of the 15 that are working on this to do it, then we're doing it because we trust them and we want them to have the leeway to move quickly. So, yeah, in terms of, I think, decentralization, I think it's more about having well structured protocols in terms of rights and having balanced incentives.
00:39:16.794 - 00:39:46.556, Speaker A: And that happens at the protocol design stage. I don't know that it's as much around. I mean, in deepen, the nodes are not homogeneous, or as homogeneous, I guess, as layer ones and L2. So it's less around just raw node count and I think also less around token ownership of insiders. I just think we should have better structured governance, meaning veto rights and very limited scope, not we should have, like, a lot of people with a say over what the network does.
00:39:46.748 - 00:41:01.838, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of like when everybody, I don't know, the Thomas Edison quote was like, if I asked everybody what they wanted, they would say a faster horse, like the governance by community or committee is often kind of the death blow. And I was watching a podcast recently with Tesla's former head of AI on autonomous robots, who was like, one of the things that I learned with Elon is it's very helpful in larger organizations or organizations at some level of scale. To empower someone with a big hammer and essentially come in and just make decisions and move on. And I think that has also plagued some of these other infrastructure and the blockchain space, because there's so many different choices and so many people kind of putting their thoughts into the market that it's not bad per se, but it just slows down the speed of iteration, and that speed in business is just everything. Got to make that flywheel crank as fast as possible.
00:41:02.014 - 00:41:09.182, Speaker A: Yeah. Goes back to the latency point, just like slowly it. Yeah. What are you excited about it in deepen logan?
00:41:09.326 - 00:42:04.330, Speaker B: Um, I think the interesting thing, to your point, I think the coordination standpoint, I'm just excited about products. Like, very, very excited about products. I'm. I feel like I went down the road probably way too far on the infrastructure side, because I just wanted to make sure that if products ultimately achieve some product market fit, that they didn't fall flat on their face. It just made me so sad to see time and time again, these early breakout applications get to some level of scale and then just having anti network effects, because the underlying blockchain infrastructure could not support that level of scale that they wanted. And so I feel like the further that I got down that rabbit hole is like, all right, I'm tired of talking about infrastructure. Just give me an app.
00:42:04.330 - 00:43:28.120, Speaker B: And to me, when I started wrapping my head around what deepen ultimately enabled via coordination, it just made sense. I think one of my potential superpowers is just kind of cutting through the bullshit and trying to, like, think longer term. I think if you can think from the venture perspective and that ten year time horizon and actually make investments for that ten year period out, there's a lot of alpha, including thinking about the largest markets. And to me, wireless adrenal with fixed Internet access, they're absolutely huge markets. And previously, it was just harder to coordinate on crypto rails. And it's been cool to see these networks start to come together and then even getting past the product, the next iteration, to me, after the Ponzi anomics and just throwing your finger up in the air and saying, I think it's worth this much, is cash flows. And that seems like the natural step of, all right, you build products, and then it's like, all right, do people care about your product? It's like, do they pay for it in some form or fashion where you can show money? And so to me, all these pieces are kind of lining up.
00:43:28.120 - 00:43:53.150, Speaker B: It would be obviously great if we can have that one breakout app. So it's kind of definitive, but I think the smart money, in my opinion, is already moving in this direction. To your point, I think the broader crypto community is probably a year or two behind, but that's kind of always how it is. They're a little bit slower than most.
00:43:53.530 - 00:44:00.722, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I think there will be some cool deep end products coming out this year. I'm wearing my smart ring right now that I got by staking. Solana.
00:44:00.826 - 00:44:01.510, Speaker B: Nice.
00:44:02.570 - 00:44:03.834, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully a few more.
00:44:03.962 - 00:44:15.450, Speaker B: So whether in your portfolio or kind of like adjacent, what specific products are you excited about for the rest of 2024 or like, kind of maturing throughout 2025?
00:44:16.150 - 00:45:12.660, Speaker A: Yeah. The two that I'll mention, which I think are not the most novel from just a novelty perspective, but the most important are Juana Andrina and home Internet. We've already talked them out a bit, but it's effectively, think about investing in solar panels for your house. You make a big purchase and now you have your energy guaranteed for the next ten years, and maybe you can sell it back to the grid and make some extra money or the things last 20 years. So, like, you make your money back in ten and you got ten years of sort of like bonus returns on top or extra electricity. Andrino is trying to take this model and just basically do it for Internet, and it's way more powerful there because a router costs like 5100, maybe a super premium router, 100, 5200 bucks, not 20k for solar panels or solar installation. So you don't need to deal with lenders and this entire ecosystem like Wall street, but you can give people the same sovereignty pitch back of like, hey, buy this device.
00:45:12.660 - 00:45:57.592, Speaker A: You're going to now provision your own Internet access. The cost that you would have paid by paying your regular Internet bill, you basically get paid back in six months and this device is going to last you five years. So your tail end economics of owning the asset are really compelling. And I think this ownership resilience, sovereignty thing will resonating. Consumer says in a way of like, we see power outages and you want to have backup power or the Internet goes down and you want to like, have, have sovereignty over that. And so I think, yeah, they'll do really well selling routers that effectively, you know, connect with each other and to the grid that they have set up in like apartment buildings and other types of buildings across in the cities that they cover. The other one that's similar is daylight on the energy side or.
00:45:57.592 - 00:45:58.256, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead.
00:45:58.368 - 00:46:50.252, Speaker B: You want to maybe briefly on Adriana. I think one thing that got me super excited after diving deeper into that was just how expensive the cost of the last mile actually was to transport from the data center. Because the data center backhaul was actually, you can get really cheap Internet, like extremely fast Internet. It's just hard to transport that from the data center where the Internet or fiber is already located to these different parts of. And the technology that Adrena built. Kind of combined with the sovereignty was super interesting where you have the sovereignty aspect, but you also just have a better product at the end of the day because it's cheaper Internet. And going back to the questions that we've had around demand side throughout this podcast is like, everybody needs fucking cheaper Internet.
00:46:50.252 - 00:46:59.270, Speaker B: If you can lower Internet costs and provide equal or better experience, I think a lot of people will opt into that.
00:46:59.970 - 00:47:58.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. And the level of coordination costs, I think people that are not investors or in this stuff every day don't realize. But in energy, for example, a solar today, if you get solar panels on your house, probably 60 that dollar is going to licensing, taxes, financing, soft costs, all the stuff that is, or labor, all the stuff that's not associated with the actual installment of devices on your home for I guess the equivalent for like, I don't know the exact numbers, but like we can literally do like a submarine cable from like the United States to like Europe or South America for like, I don't know, a couple billion dollars. But you could not deploy like last mile Internet in New York City for a few billion dollars like that. That's the scale of like coordination costs that are so hard to actually build this last mile. And yeah, Andrino, just like partners with real estate property managers and future proofs they're building and they figured out this mousetrap that already the economics are proven to be much lower. They're already doing Internet for $30 a month.
00:47:58.100 - 00:48:16.836, Speaker A: You can go and get it today. Well, not in this part of Manhattan, but other parts of New York. You can go and get it today for $40 a month or $30 a month. And so, yeah, I totally agree, it's going to be an absolute no brainer. Nobody has loyalty towards their fucking comcast or whatever. They should absolutely be earning tokens for the Internet they're providing and consuming.
00:48:16.948 - 00:48:26.240, Speaker B: And hopefully they may surprise some people with how much ARR they're actually producing when they start flipping the switch.
00:48:26.980 - 00:49:09.806, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. They have more than 10,000 people using their network today for Internet every day. I'll say that the other company that is a similar vein is daylight, which I've also already mentioned, but on the energy side, they are taking a similar path on basically trying to collapse the cost of deploying new electrification for homes. If you're, for most people in the country today, unless you live in a place with extremely cheap energy, sort of a no brainer to get solar panels on your house and maybe even a battery, depending on how much you use and if the grid will pay you for it. But this is another case where the costs have come down a lot. It's a no brainer for people, but there's these massive coordination costs around.
00:49:09.806 - 00:49:55.610, Speaker A: Like, people don't know how to electrify their home, they don't know how to put the pieces together on financing. And just like never, you don't go home one day and you're like, oh, I'm going to spend ten or 20k on my home. Daylight is basically collapsing this model, by allowing these installers to share leads with each other. If you're a person who has solar panels on their home, you may be very likely to install H vac or install future proof windows that save a lot of energy as well. The very first iteration of daylight looks basically as a consumer. It's an app that has information on your home and suggests you a bunch of different ecosystem of installers for how to electrify your home. And for installers, it's this lead network where if I'm a solar installer today, I go and make $1,000 putting solar on somebody's home.
00:49:55.610 - 00:50:29.540, Speaker A: They want H Vac and they want a whole bunch of other stuff that I don't know how to do. Now, I can sell that lead to the network and earn a proportion of the economics that I may get on the tail end as the user reinvests in their home. It's like, I got very, very pilled on this idea from at ribbit. We backed this company called Loanpal, which was like one of, in my opinion, the best fintech, like, in the world. I think it's NEA's biggest portfolio company. These guys went absolutely nuts. This guy's haze Bernard, he sold his last company to.
00:50:29.540 - 00:51:13.966, Speaker A: He started SolarCity, sold it to Tesla, then went and did Loanpal, or it's called a good lead now, but it's called Loanpal back then. These guys started off in 2017, and from, like, 2017 to 2021, they went from literal standstill, 0% to 40% of lending for residential solar markets in the US. They were in 2021. I want to say they made, like, 400 mil of cash flow per quarter. Yeah, they were like a billion and a half bucks of annual cash flow. Literally just, I mean, they would sell a resident their core value add was that you had these solar installers going to people's home and trying to sign them up for solar. And traditionally, you would have to go to a bank to get the loan approved, and that would take a day or two.
00:51:13.966 - 00:51:35.816, Speaker A: What loanpal did was create an underwriting system that basically got them an answer in 30 seconds. These solar installers, for the first time were able to, at the kitchen table, go to someone and say, hey, we'll approve you right now for this $25,000 installation. If you say yes, we don't need to come back the next day. And back to our point on latency like this. Absolutely. Just like, crushed everybody else. They sold insane amounts of solar panels.
00:51:35.816 - 00:52:10.390, Speaker A: The installers loved them because they were. Conversion rates were so much higher. Sold an insane amount of solar panels, they were turned around back. And then as soon as somebody bought solar panels, like six months later, they would send them a physical mail card saying, do you want to refinance your home with us, too for this lower rate? This is in 2021, when rates were near zero, and they would make another 1500 bucks off every homeowner. So it was like the unit economics were absolutely bonkers. And daylight is the crypto version, but much lower ticket, crypto enabled version of this. It's not just solar, but you can reinvest in other places of your home.
00:52:10.390 - 00:52:19.870, Speaker A: And, yeah, we think it's going to be an absolute killer. I was so mind blown by how quickly the loan pal grew and how powerful it became. We think daylight's going to do it again, but faster.
00:52:20.730 - 00:53:16.020, Speaker B: It is a very interesting concept. I think it's been interesting also, just with the amount of hype and excitement around GPU's and AI's, everybody's like, oh, no, we don't have enough energy to support these data centers, or we need to continue to ramp up energy. And some of the thought or ideas that are coming around out from the decentralized energy grids, TBD, whether just like purely decentralized energy grids, if it's too early on, like the battery or solar, but maybe this kind of lead generation is the next iteration to act as a stepping stone. And then when that does happen, they kind of already have all the customer base and can kind of plug people in.
00:53:16.600 - 00:53:29.760, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. I think the peer to peer energy, actual grid type stuff is really interesting, but I don't see a way to venture finance it today. I don't know what else to say.
00:53:29.840 - 00:53:38.776, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe moral of the story of this podcast is reduce latency and make the flywheel spin faster.
00:53:38.888 - 00:53:40.060, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely.
00:53:40.640 - 00:53:41.136, Speaker B: Cool.
00:53:41.208 - 00:53:44.420, Speaker A: And come to ev three for your deep end pre seed or seed raise.
00:53:46.080 - 00:54:03.700, Speaker B: Awesome. Is there, I think it's been like a great kind of deep diving deep in your background where you see things going, talking about individual projects that excite you. Is there anything else that you kind of want to cover or things that we potentially missed?
00:54:05.640 - 00:54:34.710, Speaker A: No. The only other thing I'll mention, we've, we've built our firm on the back of really trying to help Dpin grow and build public goods for the space, too. So we run an analytics site called Dpin ninja that you can go to the URL too. You can see the on chain revenue dilution metrics, multiples, a whole bunch of other information on DPIn projects if you're a founder, investor, builder who's in the space. We host an annual conference. We're doing it in New York City this year on August 10. So please find a way to reach out to us on Twitter or telegram or something.
00:54:34.710 - 00:54:38.662, Speaker A: We'd love to have you there. And it's a lot of fun bringing together the deep end community once a year.
00:54:38.806 - 00:55:04.400, Speaker B: Awesome. Now, I went to the first one in California. I think it was at the same time as Stanford Blockchain conference, and it was a great first event. It, I think will go down in history with the inception of the industry or one of the first. But Sal, thanks for coming on the podcast. It was a really good conversation. Everybody needs to move faster, reduce latency.
00:55:04.400 - 00:55:22.612, Speaker B: The industry really is just starting, but I think it has the potential to be a bigger, much bigger part of GDP in the future. So appreciate you coming on and sharing all your thoughts.
00:55:22.676 - 00:55:23.452, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, Logan.
00:55:23.516 - 00:55:23.900, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
