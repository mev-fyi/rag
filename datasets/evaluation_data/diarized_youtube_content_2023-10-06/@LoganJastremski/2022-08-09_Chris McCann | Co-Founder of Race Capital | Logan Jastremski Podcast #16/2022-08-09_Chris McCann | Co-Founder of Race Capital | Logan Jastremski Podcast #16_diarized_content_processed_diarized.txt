00:00:05.920 - 00:00:17.654, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thank you very much, Chris. Super excited for this conversation and more. So really excited to be the first one in your office here in Palo Alto at race Capital.
00:00:17.782 - 00:00:28.046, Speaker B: Yeah, this is for everybody who can't see. This is our race capitol office, which is still under construction, so I think it will be done in maybe two, three weeks or so. But you're getting an early preview here.
00:00:28.118 - 00:00:44.582, Speaker A: No, I'm super excited. And one to be back here in Palo Alto, but I think the bay is just such a cool place with all the things that are going on. I mean, even with crypto, but outside of crypto, it's just, it really is a special place.
00:00:44.686 - 00:00:50.326, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I guess they don't call it Silicon Valley for no reason. This is the birthplace of a lot of these different things.
00:00:50.398 - 00:00:51.246, Speaker A: That is true.
00:00:51.398 - 00:00:54.290, Speaker B: I've lived here since 2009, so I've been here for a little while.
00:00:54.330 - 00:01:13.290, Speaker A: Wow. Maybe that's a good place to jump off. Could you go a little bit, just more, give a brief overview of who you are, how you kind of got into this spot today, and a little bit just of overall of your background?
00:01:13.370 - 00:01:33.450, Speaker B: Sure. I'll do the Broadstoks. I know you want to get into a bunch of the stories. I'm Chris McCann. I'm one of the general partners and founding partner of Race Capital, a venture fund focused on all things infrastructure, web two and web3. Prior to this, I was at Grelock Partners for five years. Prior to that, I started a company called Startup Digest, which was acquired by Techstars.
00:01:33.450 - 00:01:47.448, Speaker B: And then prior to that, I went to school in the central coast of California at a little school called Cal Poly San Luis Obispispa, and grew up in southern California. So I've been here since 2009 doing tech and startup stuff kind of since then.
00:01:47.574 - 00:02:08.000, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah. I was saying earlier, I really do think just everybody's story is fascinating. Just like how they ultimately ended up at the spot that they are today, maybe to kick it off with Startup Digest. What is the story behind that? I know you're doing that, I think, for almost ten years.
00:02:08.620 - 00:02:42.528, Speaker B: No, I guess I've been writing for a long time. I guess I'll give you the broad story, so to speak, which kind of ties into here, Silicon Valley. So I first moved to Palo Alto the day after I graduated. So I throw all my stuff into my car. I had to get rid of everything else, everything that fit in there. I drove, actually here to Palo Alto. I had no plan, no job, no anything, but I wanted to be in Silicon Valley doing tech related stuff and the very first place I went to is actually a place that used to exist on University Avenue, which is just the street over called University Cafe.
00:02:42.528 - 00:02:51.968, Speaker B: So I came in, I ordered brunch, and then I heard two guys next to me talking about Facebook. So I look up and I look over. One of them was Mark Zuckerberg, and one of them was Michael Arrington.
00:02:52.064 - 00:02:52.940, Speaker A: No way.
00:02:54.000 - 00:03:26.746, Speaker B: So I'm sitting there eating breakfast, listening to them, and then the thought popped in my head is, I want to be here in Palo Alto. So that's when I got my first apartment downtown, not too far away from here. And then I started working at this. I won't say the name, but, like, this place that I didn't necessarily love, but I kind of needed. I was a broke college student, so I sort of needed a job. But me and my roommate at the time, Brendan McManus, on nights and weekends, we do side projects. So we probably had 20 or so different things we were trying to concoct all at the same time.
00:03:26.746 - 00:04:09.324, Speaker B: And startup Digest was actually just one of those. It was probably the least likely, we thought, to actually turn into a company, because what it was is at my work on the weekends and stuff, I didn't have anything else to do. And so I started just going to a lot of the tech events here in Silicon Valley, and I noticed there wasn't really a place to find a lot of this information. And so what I did is I just made a list for myself of all the events that I thought were cool and worthwhile to go to. And because I had a lot of free time back then, I actually went to a lot of them, and I started basically curating, kind of writing notes on. Here are the ones that are good, not so good, and ones that I thought were quality and made, like, a curated list for myself. And some of my friends were like, hey, this is really cool.
00:04:09.324 - 00:04:25.004, Speaker B: Can you send this to me, too? So startup Digest got started was I just sent 22 of my friends on a BCC line. Hey, here are all the cool things going on in Silicon Valley. Here's the list. And in about four weeks, people just forwarded it to other people, and the list of 22 turned to about 10,000.
00:04:25.092 - 00:04:25.760, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:26.100 - 00:04:51.914, Speaker B: And then we had, again, this was just one of the things we had. We didn't intend this to be a company, but we had a lot of the conferences that we were featuring on there. Some of them actually wanted to pay us to be featured in the newsletter. And me and my roommate, his name is Brendan McManus. We're like, this is crazy. Somebody wants to pay us to be in a newsletter that we're already going to put them in. It just felt like, I don't know, we stumbled upon this secret or something.
00:04:51.914 - 00:05:08.330, Speaker B: Again, maybe to keep in mind contextually, this is in 2009, tech newsletters were not a thing. I know me saying it now, everybody's like, oh yeah, tech newsletter. Yeah, I get it. I understand it. There's all these things that are out there. Back then, nobody was doing this stuff. We were one of the very first customers on Mailchimp.
00:05:08.330 - 00:05:32.766, Speaker B: When we first started, there wasn't really a lot of tooling around any of this sort of stuff. Most people thought we were a little bit nuts, but yeah, startup Digest ended up covering just Silicon Valley to eventually we grew the company to cover pretty much every major metropolis city worldwide. 550 cities grew to a million subscribers. And then it was ultimately sold to Techstars in 2012 or 13 timeframe.
00:05:32.838 - 00:05:33.490, Speaker A: Wow.
00:05:33.790 - 00:05:40.222, Speaker B: So yeah, it was kind of like the earliest canonical tech newsletter. I guess if you can kind of.
00:05:40.366 - 00:06:08.626, Speaker A: Think back then, that's amazing. I think, I mean, I think it's wild that you were in a cafe, Zuckerberg was next door or sitting next to you, and you're like, Palo Alto seems like the spot kind of, and then leveraging or kind of like that mindset or place to be to curate different events and things happening in the bay and how that kind of just grew like wildfire.
00:06:08.738 - 00:06:46.144, Speaker B: Yeah, because a lot of it too is like, I guess we were also fortunate of like tech grew a lot bigger too, because a few things to keep in mind, 2009, Facebook was not Facebook. We know today Facebook was pretty small. I think Facebook was only covering college students then in 2009, it wasn't even available. If you graduated, you weren't allowed to be there anymore. It wasn't, it was just a college network and then also just tech generally. Like being a tech founder, a tech entrepreneur, starting a startup, this was not necessarily like a cool thing to do back then. It wasn't really popularized, it wasn't glorified, it wasn't financialized, any of this sort of stuff.
00:06:46.144 - 00:07:19.898, Speaker B: It was a very small cottage industry. And the growth of that and the growth of interest in this a both led to sort of subscriptions and people subscribing to startup Digest, but also, I mean, has done much greater for the world as a whole. But like, I really saw a lot of that change over that time period from even nine to ten to eleven. There was a huge growth in this whole back then. It wasn't even sort of considered an industry. We call it like the startup or tech industry. But back then it was just like kind of some people here that is.
00:07:19.914 - 00:07:49.532, Speaker A: Super interesting, I think. I mean, what gave you. I think the journey of an entrepreneur or a founder can sometimes be lonely and scary and intimidating. So what gave you the confidence, let's say, a poor college student at the time, to leave the job? I know it wasn't the one that you necessarily love, was it? Just having that rapid subscriber base and then people being like, here, we'll pay you money for these ads. That gave you the confidence to do it full time.
00:07:49.636 - 00:08:27.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say two things. One, I guess the more real answer to this is, one, the driving force of not wanting to work at the job that I was at, my co founder was the same way, too. We both wanted to do our own thing. I'm not sure how natural. We just did not like where we currently were, and we wanted to do something else for ourselves. So I think that was probably the biggest driving motivating factor. The other thing too is we did a really small sort of angel round, if you will, from mostly people who, alumni from the college that I went to.
00:08:27.664 - 00:08:46.940, Speaker B: And we didn't raise a lot, but it kind of gave us the sort of confidence that we at least wouldn't starve. And we'd like, you know, have an apartment and we would be able to give, like a real go at this for twelve to kind of 18 months with just the two of us. We had no employees at the time. We didn't have kind of anything with us. It was just me and the co founder.
00:08:47.020 - 00:09:15.812, Speaker A: That's amazing. That's crazy. I'm always admiring stories like that because it's not easy. I think oftentimes sometimes when people can tell these stories, or even people don't know how hard it is to actually go through those motions and the upfalls, the euphoria and the terror and all those emotions that you're going through as you're building something. And so I always find it very impressive.
00:09:15.916 - 00:09:54.778, Speaker B: Yeah, probably the biggest difficulty for us is we actually tried to do sort of an institution around, or venture around or finance, and we probably pitched every single person on Silicon Valley, on San Joao Road, which is probably why I know all these people now. Basically everybody 100% said no to us because their assumption was tech newsletters is not a scalable business. There's nothing venture scale here at all, whatsoever. This is like, Chris, this is a cute, nice newsletter that you're doing. And keep doing it. But this isn't a business error. Again, I think it's very hard with hindsight of now, there's so many examples that you can point to.
00:09:54.778 - 00:10:11.210, Speaker B: I think it's very obvious that this was a market sector that very few people are paying attention to. But back then, almost nobody would give us the fortitude or time of day. They thought the subscriber base was interesting, but from a company perspective, they just, nobody understood it.
00:10:11.290 - 00:11:08.668, Speaker A: Yeah, it is funny, a lot of people, it is interesting just how looking back, you can often see things from a much different perspective. It seems, as you mentioned earlier, that tech news was not going to be big, but now it's obvious just how large tech has gotten and how mandatory. We need these different platforms to keep up with it, let alone just crypto. Crypto. It's been interesting just on the media side from that standpoint. One, because it's kind of confusing and sometimes, I mean, the tech is very hard to follow, but also one week kind of feels like a day in the crypto land. So these different media avenues have kind of spun off to focus on crypto only, which has been interesting.
00:11:08.764 - 00:11:56.332, Speaker B: Yeah. A, you both have like different platforms and different topics. Like now you have video, you have podcast, you have Twitter, you have threads, you have newsletters, all that sort of stuff. Again, back then, blogging was just sort of starting and tech newsletters weren't really taken seriously and podcasts were sort of a thing, but it wasn't something like everybody listened to and it just wasn't, there wasn't like the amount of media consumption that I think you see today. And then also, there wasn't a lot of these subtopics where now there's writers in web3, crypto, Solana, there's every single different topic you can think of. Enterprise, software, data, whatever. There's probably a tech newsletter, a writer, somebody covering a lot of these things.
00:11:56.332 - 00:12:13.640, Speaker B: Back then, there were no subtopics. It was just tech. And it's just an overall broad topic that everybody paid attention to. It's gotten much more fractured, interesting, specialized. And then also the platform media shift landscape has also changed a lot, too.
00:12:13.800 - 00:12:27.168, Speaker A: What do you feel like from that time at startup digest that was kind of like helped you, or I mean, even running a company as a founder, what were kind of like some of your key takeaways or learnings from that experience?
00:12:27.304 - 00:13:18.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say off top of my head, probably three, like community distribution, and then I guess like the sort of ecosystem side of things again, like tech startups weren't really like a thing. And like, a lot of this had to, like, really develop mostly through a lot of like, hackathons and stuff like this. There was also, most of these weren't huge successes, but it was interesting to see the progression of it. I remember Facebook, when they opened up their platform for non college student users and developers to use it, they started the Facebook platform group, and then they actually called it a name, it was the Facebook fund. And then they invested in a bunch of companies to be built on top of Facebook. Some of those were Zynga and Lyft and a bunch of others which they actually caught. Right.
00:13:18.090 - 00:13:54.218, Speaker B: And it was just down the street. So I was there helping out for like, kind of unofficially for them and kind of the program as well. Twitter kind of had a very similar one, too. So similar to what you see today of all the layer one ecosystem, starting funds and trying to sort of develop this ecosystem around it. We were sort of the distribution funnel point for a lot of these things. So the Facebook platform team didn't talk to me because of me, they talked to me because we reached a ton of people. And those developers were very important to the things they were doing, similar to like a Y combinator or like a Techstars or 500 startups.
00:13:54.218 - 00:14:35.456, Speaker B: And so I got to interact with a bunch of these things that were trying to create ecosystems around their own platforms. And then community, because for each one of the newsletters that we did, we actually had specific curators who would pick and curate all the events and news for their specific, either vertical or location. And so we had to build out a whole ecosystem of people, too, to help kind of curate this on a weekly basis. And so the operational complexity of all these things was quite high, and we had to build a whole lot of internal tools for ourselves, which that kind of led to, like, the second coming I did, of a lot of the things we built for ourselves that we didn't really have.
00:14:35.568 - 00:14:45.808, Speaker A: That makes total sense. And a lot of those are directly transferable skills to web3. And I'm sure helped you turbo charge a lot of the things that you've done since then.
00:14:45.944 - 00:15:22.070, Speaker B: Yeah, it just, I don't know, it's always made much more logical sense to me. Like, I kind of got it right away versus I think people may be coming in from more traditional inside. They don't really understand, like, why the community, why this external group of people, like, why are these validators? It feels very odd and very different to how you would normally run a company. But given we did not have a lot of funding. We had to do a lot of this community stuff, and that was the only way we were able to convince a worldwide network of writers and curators to do it with us. We had to do it ourselves. And by the way, we had no token incentive to do this.
00:15:22.070 - 00:15:27.418, Speaker B: We had to do this the good old fashioned reputation based way. There was nothing to, there was nothing to use.
00:15:27.514 - 00:15:33.842, Speaker A: That's funny. The token does help accelerate some things.
00:15:34.026 - 00:15:36.354, Speaker B: In hindsight, I wish we would have had that.
00:15:36.522 - 00:15:55.870, Speaker A: That is funny. Maybe pivoting a little bit from there. After startup Digest, what was your next venture? And kind of like continuing along the path, like how did you get into the vc space?
00:15:55.950 - 00:16:39.356, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll try to shorten this one a little bit. But as I mentioned, for Startup Digest, we had all these curators, and so we built a whole bunch of internal tools for ourselves to help manage a lot of our community and stuff like that. And so our natural thought is we were going to take all the stuff we built specifically for startup Digest, generalize this, and turn this into a platform for managing external groups and communities and all that. You can kind of like think what people are trying to use, what people are trying to use discord for today. We were doing a lot of this back in like the 2011 1213 timeframe. We were trying to sell this internal to companies for companies to manage their external communities. And the number one question we got from most of these companies is what external communities? Again, it was a very unnatural motion for a lot of these folks.
00:16:39.356 - 00:16:55.028, Speaker B: At Doohan. We did raise money. We had companies like Microsoft, et cetera that used it. But one of the biggest, most active groups was a much smaller one called the Thiel Fellowship. The Thiel fellowship, started by this guy named Peter Thiel, founder of, people may.
00:16:55.044 - 00:16:55.960, Speaker A: Have heard of him.
00:16:57.020 - 00:17:45.092, Speaker B: He started this crazy idea called the Thiel Fellowship, where he would give college students, I think it was 20 or $100,000, to drop out of school and pursue whatever they wanted to pursue. It could be a company, it could be research, it could be whatever that may be. And so this whole format of fellows, mentors, the people running the program, they actually used, the company is called Grouptie. They actually used all the tools to manage this ecosystem of people. So all of the fellow communication mentor, fellow communication, all the newsletter stuff, all of that, they used it. They were the ones that kind of used it the most out of all the customers that we had, not the biggest from an economic side, but the most by usage side. And one guy in the group who used it a lot was this guy named Dan Petio, who was a partner at Greyhawk.
00:17:45.092 - 00:18:25.130, Speaker B: And every week Dan would message me and say, hey, can we use this tool for Grelock? And every week I would tell him no. And the reason why I would say no is I wanted to be very careful from a founder perspective, if Greylock was using the product, the number one question I would get is, is Greylock investing? And if I said no, that would be a very negative signal towards me and the company. And so I basically forbid any VC investor to use the product. But if VC's love being told something more than anything else, it's being told no. And so Dan would, like, literally message me all the time. We tried to do the company for a year and a half. We got to 1015 people.
00:18:25.130 - 00:18:49.328, Speaker B: Long story short, it didn't work out. I helped all the team kind of find other things. I was thinking what I wanted to do next, I guess. And Dan Pertillo messaged me again, saying, hey, can we use it now? And I messaged back saying, hey, literally, we're shutting down the company. I'm happy to come by the office and show you, but this is pretty much dead dead. If you want to, I'm able to walk through you through it, but there's nothing to use anymore. He's like, it's okay.
00:18:49.328 - 00:19:27.708, Speaker B: Come over. We came over sort of to a room like this, and there's a whiteboard at the end of the screen. And Dan wanted to brainstorm about how you might apply this group, community network based thinking to a venture fund. How would we take what we did for the fellowship? How might you apply that to a venture fund in Greylock context? And so we whiteboarded a whole bunch of stuff on the whiteboard. And at the end of it, Dan was like, how would you like to do that here? And I was like, what do you mean? He's like, all the stuff you just wrote, just do that here. I was like, you want me to work here? And he's like, yeah, come hang out and do all this, whatever you want. We'll give you a lot of freedom to do so.
00:19:27.708 - 00:19:33.100, Speaker B: And so. Honestly, I didn't have anything else really planned out to do. And so I said, sure, I guess so.
00:19:33.180 - 00:19:33.780, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:19:33.860 - 00:19:35.268, Speaker B: That's how I ended up at Graylock.
00:19:35.364 - 00:19:36.564, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:19:36.732 - 00:19:38.540, Speaker B: Which is a very non obvious path.
00:19:38.620 - 00:19:54.298, Speaker A: No, no. I mean, I'm just thinking about it going back even to, like, straight out of undergrad. You're just like, I need to be in Palo Alto and that series of decisions ultimately leading to this opportunity, it's a super cool story.
00:19:54.394 - 00:20:11.490, Speaker B: Yeah. Again, a lot of things always make sense in hindsight rather than foresight. I would have never predicted that to be there. And by the way, when I joined Grelk, I thought I was going to join there for, I don't know, maybe a month or two and help them with this community thing and probably start something else. I ended up staying there for almost five years, so I was there for a while.
00:20:11.570 - 00:21:10.624, Speaker A: That's amazing, huh? That is super interesting. I think just kind of all the cumulative knowledge that you, it's interesting, just like the skills that you pick up over time, like sometimes you don't necessarily think they're relatable to other things, but how you can apply them and maybe they don't always seem obvious to you, but other people can see them as well. No, that's very cool. So at Greylock, what was kind of like your not biggest takeaways, but just like what you learned there, what you learned about the venture capital space? Because I think that's very interesting from the founder side, they're very focused on building and obviously getting to lots of users and growth and all that stuff. And you've already went through that process once. What did you learn or the takeaways that you learned at Greylock from the venture capital side?
00:21:10.752 - 00:21:47.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess maybe a little context on both Greylock and sort of what I did there. Greylock is one of the biggest, most well known sort of traditional venture funds. It's been around for, I'm going to get the day wrong. It was, I think, 69 years at the, somewhere between 50 and 60 years old. It's a very old firm, one of the most original sort of venture capital funds areas. They invested in Facebook, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Airbnb, pretty much everybody sort of, you can think of. And so the one thing they had, which at startup digest we had to develop this, but Greelek had it, is brand reputation and network.
00:21:47.478 - 00:22:42.270, Speaker B: So to layer on community onto this thing that they already had was a very, I guess, interesting exercise for me. And then I guess the two kind of main things which both tie into each other, really all around the network side is we built a whole bunch of groups and communities around different operational areas and different market spaces. So operational areas included all sort of the core operational lines of a business growth, product engineering, infrastructure, engineering, security, customer success. We had groups and communities around all the sort of best people in Silicon Valley in these particular roles, both for Greylock, portfolio companies. And more interestingly, for non portfolio companies, we mostly just wanted to pick for design. It's like the most amazing designers. We didn't really care where you were because again, for us, we wanted this to be for Greloc, we wanted this to be a more sort of network based activity to get to know people over time.
00:22:42.270 - 00:24:04.656, Speaker B: For operational ones, it was more around TalentFo, and then the more interesting ones were all around the different new emerging market spaces. So VR, AR esports, autonomous vehicles, robotics, bitcoin at the time, and this was to get to know all the people in these ecosystems, working on these new market spaces for us to, for Grelock to kind of get better, learn more about these spaces, and then also, most importantly, to build relationships with the people who are most likely to start companies in these spaces. And so coming at Greylock, you have sort of a huge situational advantage of, for example, in the VR space, if we wanted to invite all of the top headset makers, all the top video game publishers, the people running sort of VR at sort of Google and Facebook and all that sort of stuff, me with a Graylock email address, I could literally email everybody. And 60% of people that I emailed would show up, which is a ridiculously high conversion rate. Not that they would just open an email, that they would literally show up to these small groups and gatherings that we did. And so from a network based perspective, like, we really got to pick, like, the who's who and all these different things. And I guess to tie in the second part, this also really got me to understand, appreciate, and also kind of led into kind of crypto and the whole bitcoin side.
00:24:04.656 - 00:25:04.410, Speaker B: So Greylock actually made a handful of early investments in the bitcoin space in the 20 1314 timeframe. That is so blockstream, Zappo, Coinbase, all within that timeframe. But from a network community perspective, all the groups, AI, autonomous vehicles, robotics, blah blah blah, it was generally the same set of people. It was people who worked at Facebook, Google, Amazon, blah, blah, blah, tenured, Pedigree, Stanford, Cme, you know, whatever. This bitcoin thing, though, was a really oddball cast of characters that, like, did not have any typical association with, like, anything else. It was just like, you know, cryptographers, like, core bitcoin developers, like people from, like, really left field. And so, you know, because I was doing this community thing, like, you know, everybody else sort of looked normal except this one really weird sort of network that had no tie in, no network graph, no location graph.
00:25:04.410 - 00:25:33.102, Speaker B: It was just odd. It just kind of sat by itself. This got me thinking, what is this bitcoin thing? There must be something. There's something just different about this thing. While Greylock was making some of these investments, I just thought, I don't know, maybe I should just buy some of this bitcoin thing, I guess, see where it goes. This was back in early 2013. I think at the time, bitcoin is maybe 100 ish, or maybe several hundred dollars or something like that.
00:25:33.102 - 00:25:46.762, Speaker B: Again, I didn't have grand plans of what I thought it would become, but I was just really fascinated by the type of people working on this new thing were just classically not like anybody else. It just sort of sat on its own.
00:25:46.866 - 00:26:26.660, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree. And I think that's one of the other things that I've appreciated about itself. I feel like today it's one of the very few industries that is similar into the Internet. In regards to if you have a laptop, you don't have to have a lot of money, you can build an application or a DAP or a protocol, whatever it may be, and that can scale to hundreds of millions of users. Where a lot of these other fields you either need with AI rich datasets, a large amount of compute or genomics, a lot of these things just have a higher barrier to entry. I very much appreciate that about the crypto world as well.
00:26:27.660 - 00:27:14.794, Speaker B: And generally, yeah, I guess. How do they typically like to explain it? The move from sort of desktop to mainframe to mobile to whatever? It's a single paradigm kind of all built on classically, like similar sort of infrastructure technology. The really interesting about all this web3 stuff is it really is like an infrastructural paradigm shift. It is a new thing. Not saying it's better or worse, but it's just a new thing with different characteristics, different tools, different language. It's just different whether you like it or not. And so that gives the space and opportunity for net new people to come in and try new things in the beginning, in 2013 1415, this is mostly people on nights and weekends playing around with these.
00:27:14.794 - 00:27:41.118, Speaker B: Now it's gotten a lot more formalized and there's official companies and everything around it. But like one thing I think Chris Dixon always says, you always want to follow the developers and what they're doing, not during their day job, but on nights and weekends, because that usually signifies where things might be going. Again, it's not saying all these things will be commercial success, but you want to see where the energy, effort and time is spent in. And again, you're not waking hours, but all these, all kind of the more interesting stuff.
00:27:41.214 - 00:28:16.510, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I totally agree. It's now definitely much more of a full time activity for many people. But I think it's interesting now though. Like even still just looking at the developers today, I can't remember the latest metrics on the slitty devs. I think it's still less than 1020 thousand, which, I mean, down the street, Google or Apple have that many engineers in one office. I think as far as we've come, it's so interesting just because it still is so early. But it's exciting to.
00:28:16.510 - 00:28:51.184, Speaker A: Definitely exciting to watch. I definitely think personally it's the most interesting thing going on in tech today, but maybe like to jump off that. So you're following these early communities. They're a little bit cyberpunk ish. How did that process evolve? Or maybe after Ethereum's foundation or Ethereum's accretion and smart contracts, were you so, like, heavily involved in the space at that time, and what was the progression as it kept growing?
00:28:51.232 - 00:29:26.182, Speaker B: Let me try to give you the short summation of all that. Yeah, so, first of all, Bitcoin didn't really think that much of it kept in touch mostly, like, through the groups and communities and all that. Another long story, but very short. At the time, when I was a young single, no kids, I used to live in this big hacker house in Cupertino called the Rainbow Mansion. And one of my roommates, I won't say who he is, but he wasn't a founder, but he was one of the early Ethereum core protocol developers. And so he kept telling me about this, like, ethereum, the smart contract thing, whatever. Again, also contextually, keep in mind, Ethereum was not launched, not live, whatever, it's still in development.
00:29:26.182 - 00:29:55.380, Speaker B: And smart contracts were a very abstract concept. There was no Dap or anything to look at, and so people could only talk about them generally. And my roommate, he was really, really into the whole, like, code as law abstraction. And so he kept saying, like, we're gonna automate lawyers, we're gonna put all this, like, logical stuff inside the contract. And I'm like, I don't know what the hell you're doing. I was like, I don't know, you're my roommate. Like, you're pretty smart.
00:29:55.380 - 00:30:52.416, Speaker B: And so he kept telling me to participate in this Ethereum ico thing. So I was like, all right, I'll just do like a tiny little bit and see where really. And so obviously that kind of took off into life of its own. And I got to meet a lot of the sort of early developers building on top of the Ethereum ecosystem, the Xerox guys, Will, Warren Auger, sort of joey, all that sort of stuff again, before any of this was cool, and it was really, really small. And then I also participated, another long story, I'll try to give the short version in this little thing starting up called Binance, I participated in that kind of pre sale ico thing. And then at the time, I was trying to kind of get greylock to take a lot of this more general web3 smart contract stuff a little bit more seriously back then. I think there is a little bit more bitcoin maximalism bent to most of the stuff that they did.
00:30:52.416 - 00:31:36.500, Speaker B: And so I realized I wasn't really going to be able to do it to its full extent there. So after five years, I decided to kind of leave and pursue this kind of on my own. This was the best timing of all time, because this is right in 2018, when everything fell down on the cliff. And then one of my really good friends, this woman named Edith Young, she was at 500 startups at the time, and she was starting this thing called the 500 Startups blockchain accelerator track to take their accelerator program and work with a handful of early stage founders to build web3 companies, or sort of crypto companies at the time. And then, so she asked me to be an advisor for the program, and so I helped her pick all the companies to be a part of it. And the very first company we picked to be a part of the cohort was Raj nanitoli from Zachary.
00:31:36.540 - 00:31:40.592, Speaker A: Wow. Wow, that's amazing.
00:31:40.656 - 00:32:10.106, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess that's what led me to do this more, I guess, professionally, like 24/7 not just nights and weekends, but seeing the progression from kind of bitcoin to ethereum to some of the kind of early dapps like cryptokitties get distribution, realizing the sort of existing scaling solution just fundamentally wouldn't work. And the meeting, Anatoly, who came from Qualcomm, had a lot of crazy ideas at the time on how to fix that, but nothing built yet. We decided to back him as a person. And yeah, that became Solana.
00:32:10.178 - 00:32:55.752, Speaker A: That's amazing. So I'm super curious on high level how you think about some of your investments. You don't have to get into too many specifics and just broad strokes. I think it's super interesting, obviously, being in the Ethereum ico, then being in the right place at the right time with Anatoly and meeting him and then also the binance team. Is there anything that you feel like is kind of like a string that would pull all these together? Is that there's similar characteristics? Is there a specific thing that you're looking for? I'm curious how, on a high level, you think about some of these things.
00:32:55.936 - 00:33:36.672, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a hard time answering that because we're far more systematized. I don't know if our system, it says, but we're far more intentional about it now. But I think back in when I was doing this on the nights and weekends, so to speak, I don't know if I was intentional about it. I was mostly just following things that I thought were interesting to me or friends that I thought were doing interesting things, but I wasn't actively hunting these things, so to speak, versus now, I think, you know, running a fun, like, we have to be a little bit more intentional about the stuff. I can't just wait till I'm roommates with somebody and hope it all works out. So maybe I'll speak now as opposed to a little bit later. And I guess for the fun.
00:33:36.672 - 00:34:29.402, Speaker B: We're the early seed investors for Solana, FTX, databricks, lightning Labs, a whole bunch of other companies in the portfolio. We mostly look for, I guess, a few things. One, I guess we're super specific on what we do. Pre seed seed typically lead most of the things that we do, and we're very infrastructure centric, so we like low level system software type tools. It tends to be our sweet spot. So anything around data infrastructure, transaction systems, developer tools, payment infrastructure, financial infrastructure, computation infrastructure, low level system type stuff, this tends to be our sweet spot. And because pre seed seed, these things are generally pretty early, sometimes maybe even idea stage early, we're very biased towards the person, and so we're trying to make less calculated bets on the product or metrics or the market you're building into, because generally at the time, there really isn't any of that to look at, even if we wanted to.
00:34:29.402 - 00:35:23.526, Speaker B: And more, we're trying to really figure out the background experience, why, like why the person's fascinated about this problem, why they need to solve it, what's the more fundamental motivation? What drives them? Why do they care about this stuff? Because that's going to be the stuff that sticks with people through the long term. We care less. Like what platform with L1, whatever we're using. I think people always, because of Solana, I think people always assume we're like a Solana only, or like a Solana specific fund or something. And the best example I always get to that one is, yes, we were early seed investors for Solana, but also lightning labs, which is the most hardcore bitcoin, too. So we're not religious people. I guess we mostly try to fine and back and work with, like, the person and the biggest north star guiding question we have for this is even we do this today in all of our investment memos.
00:35:23.526 - 00:35:56.792, Speaker B: The core question for us is, do we see ourselves, or could we see ourselves as being co founders with a specific person? And if so, then, yes, we jump in. And if not, even if we like a lot of the dynamics around it, we don't. Because we, especially in this early stage, you have to be, you have to be willing to kind of get your hands hurting and roll up your sleeve sometimes. And some things aren't always as clear. And so companies, they move past, they meander, they kind of figure it out. So you have to be very comfortable with the journey. Again, we could do this because we're very early stage.
00:35:56.792 - 00:36:09.162, Speaker B: We don't have a big liquid portfolio. We don't do trading, we don't do market making. We don't do any of that sort of stuff. So different funds have different things and stuff they look for. But for us, we tend to be infrastructure early stage, very founder centric.
00:36:09.266 - 00:36:40.944, Speaker A: That's amazing. How has, I think 2017 was interesting, just with all the icos and then obviously the two, three year bear market, what kind of did you see, I mean, especially starting the fund during that point, how did you kind of see the development from the bear market, like the founders and like, the projects at that point to what happened, like the last year or two?
00:36:41.112 - 00:37:13.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess, to clarify, yeah, we started, even though, I guess I started helping out Edith at 500 in the 2018 timeframe. And then Alfred, our other partner, he was also an advisor. We both really liked each other, decided to start a fun together. That was in 2019. So a little bit later on, we were around and I was doing a lot of stuff from a more personal basis in 2018. This is a tough time. I think people now like to talk about how hard things are, our valuations gone down or whatever.
00:37:13.890 - 00:37:36.500, Speaker B: I think when we invested in Solana, the market was down like 75% plus. When we invested in FTX, I think it was like 80, 90% plus. People are depressed now, at least even in depressed times. Solana is getting 2 million plus active daily users on the platform. Back then it was like 101,000 maybe.
00:37:38.160 - 00:37:42.024, Speaker A: There was no really applications. It was just icos.
00:37:42.192 - 00:38:53.278, Speaker B: It was unclear how much if any of this stuff would survive versus now I think you have the question of what will this turn into, what survivability? I think we probably, probably pass the hump on this. Like, I think most of the stuff will be here, whether we like it or not in some form or fashion, but back then it was really survivability. But you had a lot of people working on a lot of really interesting concepts and ideas which have bled over and into why a lot of these things worked. One example I like to give, which I don't know if there's enough people who actually know about this or appreciate this here, but when I left Greylock and was helping out with the 500 startups accelerator, one of the things I always wanted to do is Greylock was always for better or for worse, was always very San Francisco Bay Area centric. So almost all the investments, all the things, all the people, everything was here, Los Angeles too far, it was very here. And while I appreciate that and I like that, and I built up a huge network here, even with startup Digest, like, we were global by nature. And so when I left I wanted to do something for myself.
00:38:53.278 - 00:39:06.246, Speaker B: So me and my wife and our first kid, we actually moved and we lived in China for five, six months, mostly in Beijing, straight up in Beijing again, I guess like moving here. I had no plan, no idea, no anything. Show up in Beijing, just repeat that.
00:39:06.278 - 00:39:07.822, Speaker A: Process in another country.
00:39:07.926 - 00:40:11.978, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going? Luckily my partner now Edith, she speaks Mandarin, she spends a lot of time in China and so she came out there for, I think two or three months. We just sort of be there and meet companies. One of the most interesting, fascinating stories that, again, I don't know if a lot of people in western world know about was the biggest company protocol at the time, which got ridiculous traction in the worst of times, was this exchange called FCoin. FCoin was started by, it was the former Hoibi CTO and they wanted to build a radically new Dex and Dao and all this sort of stuff again before a lot of these concepts were talked about all around this thing called fcoin, which is the core native token for it. And the way you would earn it was by, through. The more you traded, the more you earn it was basically the prototypical, what we call liquidity mining. They developed this in like 20, 1718, again, before any of these concepts were known or talked about or developed on in a very short order, they basically became the biggest exchange in the world by volume, like times, a few multiples.
00:40:11.978 - 00:41:13.958, Speaker B: Again, most of it was probably heavily wash training because you were incentivized to trade. But the amount of copies and sub copies and copycats and people partners and all this sort of stuff, it was this ridiculously huge thing that everybody talked about. And I remember when I came back here, almost nobody even heard about this company or what it was called or anything like it. But this core concept of liquidity mining and the pitfalls, upsides, downsides, and all that sort of seeing it, experiencing it, seeing the firsthand kind of results of it, and seeing it now being tried, like, I think compound was like, probably the bigger Us western company that tried it, like, many years afterwards, probably took some lessons learned on what to do and what not to do. But during these periods, you get these more experimentation on things that you don't necessarily see elsewhere. A few other things that I thought they did that were, again, is maybe more common today, but less so. Then one, they publicized all of the company treasury accounts so you could see their balance at any point in time.
00:41:13.958 - 00:41:50.192, Speaker B: And then there wasn't like, gated Token voting, but they basically allowed their holders to vote on initiatives or what to spend them on. So a lot of this, like, prototypical Dao stuff we kind of take for granted. Again, most of it did not work very well. So I'm not hailing this as the example of one that worked. In fact, it really burned and failed, and there was a lot of reasons on why it did so. But we actually got to meet the team while we were out there, by the way, also, just like, the work culture ethic in China is very different than here. I remember we were.
00:41:50.192 - 00:42:11.344, Speaker B: I forgot the name, but we were staying at this hotel, meeting most people just in, like, the lobby floor of the hotel. The fcoin guys were, like, scheduling back and forth a meeting with them, and it was really tough to find a time. And they're like, hey, what if we meet on Sunday night at 01:00 a.m. i mean, I'm not really doing anything. It's a little late. But, like, sure, people will literally, they don't care. 06:00 a.m.
00:42:11.344 - 00:42:20.064, Speaker B: 01:00 a.m. saturday Sunday. Like, literally, time and days, like, do not matter there. It's just. It's a very different culture. It's a very different.
00:42:20.112 - 00:42:35.370, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I mean, at Tesla, I was working on the global supercharging network, and I worked very closely with our team in China, and I can definitely echo the same sentiments 24/7 all the time.
00:42:35.910 - 00:43:08.890, Speaker B: The famous line that they're trying to get away with 996. Yes, 9 hours a day. I forgot what the second nine is for six days a week. Yes, around the clock. It's really true. Again, I felt tired and old, like being there, like I could not necessarily keep up. And so again, like a lot of these new concepts and things and experiments and all this sort of stuff even probably now is kind of being fleshed out and worked on, that will probably be indicative of the next four or five years and things that we pay attention to.
00:43:08.890 - 00:43:26.406, Speaker B: Again, it will probably be non obvious. It might not come from the markets that we're paying attention to. It might not even come from like within web3. It might be somewhere else outside. But I think it's really important to try to keep a very open mind and pay attention to a lot of these things because again, you just never know where the stuff comes from.
00:43:26.478 - 00:44:16.626, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And how, I mean, so that was kind of like through the trough to the bear market. What things about this like last bull run kind of surprised you or caught you off? Not caught off guard, but just was interesting that I think there was a lot of things personally. Wow, is that Tesla just observing all the stuff that was going on with Defi summer and composability and all the yield, farming and even the food tokens, that was kind of wild. But I think I was even more surprised like how quickly after that I feel like people were talking about nfts and how they're still like the next thing but a little bit further away. But how quickly nfts caught on, especially with the masses. I think that was unique.
00:44:16.626 - 00:44:24.874, Speaker A: Or for me personally just people I think like jpegs and so it was definitely interesting to watch.
00:44:25.042 - 00:45:14.446, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess maybe a few comments there. One is again even bitcoin and Ethereum and to even some extent Solana. It was mostly like the crypto ecosystem doing things with cryptocurrencies and trading and stuff like that. But over probably the last cycle we went from just crypto things to now we have gaming things, we have art things, we have governance related things, we have financial things, payment things, wallet things. Like it's starting to actually starting to see industries and sub industries and some of these things related or not interrelated to each other. For example, I have a former colleague of mine, Greloc. We do a lot of stuff together, although he does a lot more things than the consumer side and he looks at a lot of these gaming projects.
00:45:14.446 - 00:45:30.526, Speaker B: We just don't tend to infrastructure centric, we don't tend to do as much consumer things so his name is Mike Dubois. Sometimes Michael text me. He's like, hey, what did you think about this company? This company, this company? I'm like, I've never heard of it in my life. And I'm like, hey, what do you think about this one, this one, this one? He's like, I've never.
00:45:30.638 - 00:45:31.690, Speaker A: That's funny.
00:45:32.110 - 00:45:51.472, Speaker B: It's now big enough. That's actually possible. Again, back 13 1415 1617. It wasn't like I remember first. What was that exchange called on? Totally blanking. When I first looked up tokens on an exchange in 2017, the whole exchange in its entirety had like 30 of them. That was it.
00:45:51.472 - 00:46:21.122, Speaker B: That's all they had. That was all that existed. But it's not like that anymore. So we're starting to see specialization in sort of industries and all that. Two, I was also very surprised about the, I guess, mainstream uptake. Not in terms of users, but even in terms of investors and investor bases. Like you have the likes of Sequoia and Greylock and Benchmark and Excel and all these really huge funds taking this stuff legitimately seriously.
00:46:21.122 - 00:46:58.220, Speaker B: If you would have said this was possible in 1718, people would have thought you were joking. I don't think people would have. People would assume this would probably take five to ten years out, not two to three years out. It happened a lot faster than I think people happen, both in terms of just the investment and capital market side. But even on the user and user adoption side, again, it's not perfect. We have a very long way to go, but even getting through this very early user adopter hump is a pretty big one to cross. Whether or not we can sustain that and all that is all other set of questions, but it happened pretty fast.
00:46:58.220 - 00:47:37.670, Speaker B: And then I guess the other thing, too, more on just like the core sort of financial side. One, you have countries like, literally adopting bitcoin as legal tender. Again, if you would have said this in 2013, people would have thought you were freaking nuts. You just never would imagine it. Now we kind of just take it for granted. And then, two, you have companies like our portfolio company FTX, like literally rivaling not just the coinbases of the world, but like potentially even like the Nasdaqs of the world and really doubling down on, you know, this isn't just a crypto thing, this is going to touch real financial markets. Again, for people to think this back then, I think, would have been really hard.
00:47:37.670 - 00:47:54.162, Speaker B: And again, this has happened pretty fast, so I think it's pretty natural to have a digestion period in this I don't think we can be as crazy and extended for that period of a long time. I think it's very natural to come back and see what's real or not. A lot of the dog food coins.
00:47:54.346 - 00:47:57.802, Speaker A: I don't know about those good memes.
00:47:57.906 - 00:48:05.882, Speaker B: Yeah. But we, as an industry, we're starting to touch real core system things, whether we realize that or not.
00:48:05.986 - 00:48:44.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. I'm excited now that there are users and there are applications at least beginning to emerge now that we're building out the infrastructure and that is becoming more robust, that it is almost possible to, or starting to be possible to have tens of millions or hundreds of millions of users participate in web3. And I think that's been the most interesting thing to me, is just watching the user adoption metrics. No, but it's been very interesting.
00:48:44.170 - 00:48:52.458, Speaker B: Yeah. Internally, we always say we love tracking things like user metrics over TVL. I think it's much more indicative of where things are going.
00:48:52.514 - 00:49:19.202, Speaker A: Yes, I think TVL. I mean, I think TVL is. No, I won't get into it. Yeah, the user side is much more interesting. I think the people that are actually using the blockchains and interacting with them, I think is paramount. And it's very cool to see. I mean, even now in the bear market, I believe Solana is the only blockchain that has increasing user adoption metrics, which I find interesting.
00:49:19.202 - 00:49:39.392, Speaker A: But it's cool to see the space continue to progress maybe a little bit. We've kind of touched upon the investment process and how you got here, but maybe you talk even a little bit more high level about race and the stuff that you've been doing here and the stuff that you're excited for going forward.
00:49:39.506 - 00:49:57.084, Speaker B: Yeah. Again, I guess to recap, yeah, we do pre ct. We typically lead most of the investments that we do in all infrastructure centric in all regard. A lot of people don't know. We invest in Web three and we actually still invest in Web two. We actually do both. We're probably one of the very few funds that do both, but we intentionally do it.
00:49:57.084 - 00:50:22.360, Speaker B: And we especially love the ones where the lines blur a lot on, like, where exactly it is some people colloquially call it, like Web 2.5. I don't know if I love that, to be honest. But for example, we invested in a company called Zeet, which is building. Actually, the founder has a super interesting story. The founder, his name is Johnny Dallas. That is his real name. He started working when he was 13.
00:50:22.360 - 00:50:41.230, Speaker B: He was born and raised in San Francisco. He pestered his neighbor to work at his company, which was originally called Bebo. He was doing DevOps deployment at the age of 13, Bebo was acquired by Twitch, so he ran deployment at Twitch, and then Twitch was acquired by Amazon.
00:50:41.310 - 00:50:41.806, Speaker A: Wow.
00:50:41.918 - 00:51:02.934, Speaker B: So at the age of 16, he was a senior technical engineer on the deployment and DevOps side at Amazon, doing keynote talks at the main Amazon developer conference, which is located inside casinos, which he was legally not allowed to be in. And so the Amazon security team had to walk him out for a stock and walk him out physically, he's not allowed to be in there.
00:51:03.102 - 00:51:03.886, Speaker A: That's wild.
00:51:03.958 - 00:51:47.288, Speaker B: He started a company called Zeedsen. Zeet basically does all automated deployment for cloud infrastructure. All the stuff he was doing, he kind of productized it, which probably sounds like the most web two thing you could possibly talk about. However, a lot of people, what they use it for is running and spinning up ipfs nodes, spinning up validators, doing a lot of the stuff that, again, like a lot of this lower level stuff that we don't necessarily see, all these things have to be ran somewhere. All the computation is the sit somewhere, all the hardware is somewhere. Whether we like it or not, a lot of these things rely on each other, and we love things in the cross section or middleware section of this. And so for us, I guess, I don't want to sound too boring, but it's sort of the same thing.
00:51:47.288 - 00:52:10.852, Speaker B: Precedency, finding great entrepreneurs, building low level infrastructure stuff for areas that we think are very important going forward. Computation networks, sort of NFT related side, sort of the financial industry, payments related side. We like to try to find the core building blocks and the things that underpin and make these things possible and pick out and find the best and invest in those. It's really what we do.
00:52:10.916 - 00:52:19.172, Speaker A: That's amazing. And you started in 2019 and now just recently opened up the office in Palo Alto.
00:52:19.236 - 00:52:19.980, Speaker B: We did.
00:52:20.140 - 00:52:21.560, Speaker A: Very cool. Very cool.
00:52:22.740 - 00:52:31.540, Speaker B: We're doing the opposite of everybody else and opening a physical office. We're not based in the cloud.
00:52:32.200 - 00:52:55.780, Speaker A: That's funny. Awesome. No, it's very cool and extremely cool story. Maybe to kind of wrap things up. I'm super interested in your other skill. You recently, or a couple years ago won the National Geographic Photographer of the year. How does that happen?
00:52:56.490 - 00:53:31.344, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess. Let me say this, a few things. One, it's interesting, I've always done photography for a really long time, but I almost never talked about it because investing in venture capital, whatever, that's usually the thing that most people know me for. And photography for me, I've been doing it since 2009. I like to say before the bitcoin Genesis block, but for me, it was always more of a relaxing thing. I love being in the field, in the middle of nowhere, behind a camera, messing with settings, trying to get like a particular shot, not thinking about things, being outside of work and all that. My pictures was mostly just for me.
00:53:31.344 - 00:54:10.794, Speaker B: I just had like a portfolio and kind of posted things into. But as you mentioned, in 2016, I submitted and won the National Geographic Award prize in the nature category. And then after that, I started to do a lot more gallery showings, exhibitions, that sort of stuff in the traditional art world space. And that's when I realized, probably like a lot of other people, from the creator perspective first. A lot of these middlemen take a huge portion of what you would earn as an artist. Galleries can regularly take anywhere between 50 to sometimes 80%. And when you're talking about photography, stock photography, you're basically getting paid pennies or sub fraction of pennies for any of these things.
00:54:10.794 - 00:55:05.032, Speaker B: So to try to make a living as a photographer is ridiculously tough, almost near impossible, unless you're one of the best in the world. Even National Geographic photographer would not cut it if you wanted to make a living on the stuff. And so again, I was just treated as a hobby and I always just kind of kept it separate from work. Although when all this NFT stuff started, that's when, I don't know, it just made me bring up my own personal experience from this stuff can be used for and applied from creators doing artistic works of art. And this really does solve a lot of the problems and issues from the creator perspective. And the royalty stream is really the thing that makes it really interesting. Plus the direct connection to your audience not being intermediate by the gallery, but how actually having your own community, it's almost turning the creator into their own project, so to speak, which is a very different way than viewing it as just the artist and somebody else kind of handles all the other stuff.
00:55:05.032 - 00:55:26.258, Speaker B: And so I first did some experimentation on the Ethereum side with unique ly. I did some of my collections out there. And then this is also when I realized that trying to do NFT stuff on Ethereum was ridiculously expensive. By the way, it's really expensive as a purchaser of these. It's really expensive as the creator of.
00:55:26.274 - 00:55:27.562, Speaker A: These things to mint the NFT.
00:55:27.666 - 00:56:00.874, Speaker B: Yeah, these things can be depends on gas fees. I'm sure it's lower now, but anywhere between tens of dollars to hundreds to sometimes thousands of dollars to actually mint these things, depending on the file size and all the stuff you're working with. So this is what piqued my interest of. I was an early investor in Solana, and Solana is faster, cheaper, all that sort of stuff. And so back at the time, I was thinking, well, I wonder what exists in Solana NFT space. At the time, there was only three projects. There was the solpunks, which is basically a copyright of the cryptopunks.
00:56:00.874 - 00:56:27.030, Speaker B: There was the Solarians and creatures. And I couldn't buy the rip off thing, and I didn't really fall in love with the other two things. And so I was waiting for something, and one of my friends told me about this new project coming out called the Solana Monkey business. It was these cute little monkey pictures. And so I looked up like, the monkeys look kind of cute. It seemed like they didn't rip it off from anybody else. It was going to be natively on Solana.
00:56:27.030 - 00:56:49.146, Speaker B: And so I decided to mint a few on mint day. So I minted 34, which I own. I've never bought. I've never sold one since then. And then after that, I started exploring more in, like, the generative art space. I started this thing called Playground waves, and we worked with the outside artist named Echo, which is epoch. I did some of my photography stuff on form function.
00:56:49.146 - 00:57:11.800, Speaker B: Honestly, all this stuff is mostly just for me, too. I think as a investors, sometimes you always get a very abstracted view of these things. Like, it's easy to talk about metaplex and candy machine and all that. But have you actually tried to, like, actually do one of these things? It's not easy, by the way. It's gotten a lot easier back then. It's very not easy. It was a giant nightmare.
00:57:11.800 - 00:57:52.134, Speaker B: But, like, to actually try to use one of these things as a real person, as a developer, as a creator, I really wanted to go through the whole end to end process. And so again, it's a little separate from the funds, though, in the fact that we don't necessarily do consumer related things. It's more of just my own personal hobby. But I think it informs us a lot on how these things work, what is necessary, how these things function. It's helped us find companies because of metaplex and all this stuff. We found an enabling technology in the Arif ecosystem called Bundler, which bundles and processes all the transactions that get passed through when you're uploading files. They basically handle.
00:57:52.134 - 00:58:05.222, Speaker B: 98% of all of Arweave's transactions pass through. Bundler started by this kid named Josh. So we invested in Bundler, and we met it kind of in part through that way. So, I don't know, I just find it fun, I guess.
00:58:05.286 - 00:58:55.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I mean, if I were to summarize it all, I think it's just one super impressive being able to put yourself in the correct cracked place, continue to build and iterate on the first company and the skills that you picked up along the way to kind of apply that to the venture capital space, and then kind of learning those traits and being able to apply those to picking investment founders, and also on the community side, but also not only doing that, but doing the photography side and kind of being world class at that as well, and then kind of how that all wraps into, like, the web, three ethos and community. I think it's just super interesting. So it's. It's a very cool story.
00:58:55.334 - 00:58:56.334, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you, man.
00:58:56.422 - 00:58:57.170, Speaker A: Of course.
00:58:57.950 - 00:59:28.188, Speaker B: What's funny is I was on, I think, like, two or three weeks ago, I was on CNBC talking about FTX or whatever. And with the reporter beforehand, you usually normally do, like, a 15 minutes call briefing with the reporter that's going to be live with you. And so the guy, I'm totally forgetting his name. I probably shouldn't forget his name. Anyway, we did a pre call, and we had all these questions we were supposed to go over, and he's like, I don't want to talk about any of these things. Tell me about your photography. Okay, sure.
00:59:28.188 - 00:59:34.800, Speaker B: So we did 15 minutes on that, and then, like, 10 seconds at the end, like, okay, yeah, I'm going to do this. Show me all your pictures.
00:59:35.740 - 01:00:01.362, Speaker A: Very cool. I mean, I'm glad it's finally getting the limelight that it deserves. No, that's very cool. Well, thank you again, Chris. I really appreciate your time. Really happy to be one of the first to see the race office and, yeah, appreciate you telling your story and what you're looking forward to and crypto space and excited to see what you guys keep doing.
01:00:01.426 - 01:00:05.290, Speaker B: Yeah, and thanks for having me on the podcast. Looking forward to listening to some of the other ones as well.
01:00:05.330 - 01:00:06.514, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks, Chris.
01:00:06.562 - 01:00:07.330, Speaker B: Cool. All right, bye.
