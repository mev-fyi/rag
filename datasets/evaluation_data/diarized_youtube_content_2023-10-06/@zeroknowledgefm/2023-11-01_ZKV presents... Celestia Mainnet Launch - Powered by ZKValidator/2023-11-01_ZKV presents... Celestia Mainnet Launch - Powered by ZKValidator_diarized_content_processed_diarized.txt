00:00:28.980 - 00:00:45.610, Speaker A: You. Hello. Hey, everybody. We're going to get everyone join our screen. Hey. I think we're going to add actually everyone to this one. Perfect.
00:00:45.610 - 00:01:13.924, Speaker A: Okay, so we seem to be live. This is very exciting. Okay, so I want to welcome everyone to this very special, somewhat spontaneous live event. We are here to celebrate the launch of Celestia. And we're joined by a group of the Celestia team. I just want to make sure we got everyone on that should be on. Yes.
00:01:13.924 - 00:01:38.284, Speaker A: Perfect. Okay. Do you guys want to just say hi? I want to hear you, and I want to know that you can hear you. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. So today what we're going to be doing is we're going to be basically catching up with the Celestia team about what's just happened with the launch and talking about some of the things that are coming up.
00:01:38.284 - 00:02:05.056, Speaker A: I want to just quickly introduce us, the ZK Validator and myself. So you might know me as the host of the Zero Knowledge podcast. I have the cool logo here, but today I'm actually wearing a different hat. I'm also the co founder of the ZK Validator. And today we're actually going to be yeah, we're gonna it's the ZK Validator who's bringing you this live event. We're currently streaming on Twitter on the ZK. Validator Twitter.
00:02:05.056 - 00:02:29.736, Speaker A: The Celestia twitter. The Celestia YouTube channel, and the Zero Knowledge podcast. YouTube Channel and the ZK validator YouTube Channel. So, yeah, we're kind of trying this new format of, just know, streaming to multiple places at the same time. We hope you like it. But yeah, a little bit about ZK Validator. We run Validators on strategically aligned networks, which we feel will be or we are actually already a Celestia Validator.
00:02:29.736 - 00:02:57.188, Speaker A: And separate from this, what the ZK Validator tends to do is we are advocates for privacy in ZK. We participate in governance where we can. We build tech tools, and we launch initiatives to promote and fund ZK tech. We are also like ZK Validator and ZK Podcast co created the ZK Hack event, which I might tell you about a little bit later. We have an event coming up around that. And here with me on stage is Agni and Hector from the team. I just want you to meet them.
00:02:57.188 - 00:03:24.850, Speaker A: I think they're going to be coming in and out of the event today, but also you may have met them at other events that we've done. And we hope to do more events like this going forward. So, yeah, thank you so much for all of you for being here. I think we can now kick off our spontaneous interview with Ismail and Mustafa. So I'm going to invite everyone, some other folks, back later. But for now, I think we can kick off. Perfect.
00:03:24.850 - 00:03:34.930, Speaker A: Nice. So I think just to start off, how are you feeling? Like it's been a big day.
00:03:38.440 - 00:03:58.280, Speaker B: Pretty relieved. And yeah, actually the launch went pretty smoothly. The validator community is pretty awesome. I feel very relieved that, like, four years of work, like a team, contributors, and community leading to this day. So, yeah, pretty relieved. Very excited.
00:03:58.700 - 00:04:00.970, Speaker A: Nice. How about you, Mr.
00:04:03.120 - 00:04:18.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm also very excited. I think the launch went pleasantly in an uneventful way. It was very uneventful in the sense that it was all very rehearsed and we had multiple test sets, so it went very smoothly.
00:04:19.220 - 00:04:35.910, Speaker A: Very nice. Right now, your taglines are implementation details. Ismail and Janitor Mustafa. I feel like for our audience, it might help to learn who you really are. Yeah. Why don't you quickly introduce yourselves and your kind of connection to this project?
00:04:37.240 - 00:04:45.850, Speaker C: Sure. So I'm co founder of Celestia and CEO of Celestia Labs. I co founded Celestia, which was formerly known as legiledger with Ismail and John.
00:04:47.980 - 00:05:11.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm Ismail, also co founder and CTO of Celestial Labs. Yeah, the implementation details is a reference to an internal joke, which we were always making. The paper was written, like, over four years ago, and yeah. As a CTO, I had to deal with the implementations, and in the beginning, everything was like, it's just an implementation detail, which took four years.
00:05:13.940 - 00:05:40.730, Speaker A: Nice. So you just said you had kind of rehearsed a lot of these things. I have to say, I've never actually been backstage to a launch of a network, which I kind of am bummed that I haven't had a chance to know what it's like in the room while you're pushing the button. But can you share with us a little bit about what that felt like, even if it was rehearsed? Go back to and actually, what time exactly did it happen today?
00:05:41.100 - 00:06:11.204, Speaker B: So, first of all, there's no pushing of a button. It's, like, in the hands of the community to actually launch the chain. So, yeah, we were nervous still, despite the fact that we launched many testnets and as Mustafa said, pretty rehearsed the actual launch. But in the end, it's a decentralized project, which is not in our hands. So you cannot just push a button and launch it so things can go wrong. Right. Like, it's a distributed system.
00:06:11.204 - 00:06:15.910, Speaker B: So yeah, for that, it was pretty smooth and amazing.
00:06:20.520 - 00:06:35.150, Speaker A: Nice. Tell us a little bit like you had sort of talked about going over the steps and figuring out exactly what you needed to do. What did you do over the last few weeks in prep? What was that sort of planning, like?
00:06:36.160 - 00:06:56.800, Speaker C: Yeah, so this was after we finished the AirDrop. We had an AirDrop last month, and then after we finished that, kind of started the work of actually trying to assemble the genesis file and recommending that to validators. And then we had 75 validators at launch, which were the winners of an incentive session that we did for the box based race.
00:06:57.780 - 00:06:59.360, Speaker A: I think we were yeah, just like.
00:06:59.430 - 00:07:21.236, Speaker C: A lot of coordination with hundreds of people were involved in this launch. And the Celestial lab team is just a small part of that. Ultimately, it's the validators everyone who participated in the testnets. The entire roll up ecosystem is building roll ups and Celestial testnets and testing.
00:07:21.268 - 00:07:37.920, Speaker A: Them as well as very nice. In the blog post announcing this launch, you had said that this version of Celestia would be experimental. Can you share a little bit what that means? Like, what is already ready and what isn't?
00:07:41.300 - 00:08:24.940, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's experimental because we're the first chain to actually launch a production version of data ever sampling, and that's a massive kind of milestone or achievement. And so there's a sort of like a lot of no one really knows how that will kind of pay out in a real live network. So we have database sampling protocol, and there could be bugs, there could be other issues that need to be resolved and the community will kind of discover and fix. But ultimately, what you can use Celestial for today is you can actually deploy roll ups on it. You can use it as a data availability layer. And we also have Blob Stream, which is like a data bridge to Ethereum.
00:08:24.940 - 00:09:02.400, Speaker C: And effectively, Celestial as of now is the only chain that supports data, like significant size data blocks for roll ups. There's no chain where you can just post data blocks for roll ups at this size and scale. And so that's kind of like something that people took for granted before. Oh yeah, just dump the data on the blockchain. But no blockchain actually supported data blobs at this scale, like more than like 10. So that's what you can use Cersei for today. And of course, anyone can now run a light node.
00:09:02.400 - 00:09:24.400, Speaker C: You can go on Celestial.org and you can spin up a light node very quickly, and that light node will actually do data. But some parts of data sampling protocol are full experimental things like buffering construction and bad encoding. That's something that will evolve over time to make it more stable and reliable.
00:09:25.620 - 00:09:45.240, Speaker A: I actually saw, I think it was today that you sent it. Maybe it was today or yesterday you sent a tweet a little bit about how this idea is sort of a continuation of Satoshi's original idea. I want to kind of like, can you explore that a little bit with like, explain how Celestia fits into that picture?
00:09:45.900 - 00:10:37.172, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's actually a pure coincidence, but today, which is the day that we launched, is exactly 15 years after Satoshi launched a Bitcoin White Paper. And that wasn't planned or anything. That was just like a pure coincidence. But Satoshi also released a bitcoin white paper on October the 31st, 2008. And in the white paper, there was a section about what's called simple payment verification, which was like another name for light nodes. And the idea was that instead of having to run a blockchain node or a full node that download every block users could just run live nodes, and they could detect invalid blocks from the miners. If the miners decided to misbehave and have invalid blocks, they could detect that by something that Satoshi described as alerts.
00:10:37.172 - 00:11:41.164, Speaker C: And alerts is kind of like the predecessors of fraud proofs. And then Satoshi obviously had a 1 MB block size limit on bitcoin, and there was this whole block size war within the bitcoin community around 2013, 2014, where a part of the bitcoin community wanted to increase the block size, and then they span out bitcoin cash. But the core bitcoin community didn't want to increase the block size. And the reason for that is because if you increase the block size, it's more expensive for end users to verify the chain. But at that time, no one really thought that fraud proofs or this alert system was really practical. The state transition fraud proofs part of it was not that difficult. But the unsolved problem at the time was, how do you prove that data was actually published? How do you prove data availability? And so now with primitives, we have primitives like data availability sampling that allows lightweights to prove that data is available.
00:11:41.164 - 00:11:48.544, Speaker C: And so I would imagine that if these technologies were more mature back then, the debate might be very different.
00:11:48.742 - 00:12:02.470, Speaker A: Yeah. Did that somewhere inspire the idea, or was it something that you kind of were thinking about and then realized that that had actually existed in that time?
00:12:05.800 - 00:12:57.860, Speaker C: I've been researching layer one scalability for a very long time, and to me, it was always about, how do we increase the throughput of a blockchain without increasing the resources required for end users to verify the chain? Because scalability and throughput are different things. Just increasing throughput isn't scaling. You also have to increase throughput while making it cheap for end users to verify the chain, because that's what fundamentally differentiates web3 from web two. So I kind of made it my life's goal to figure out how to maximize secure block space in a way. And at the time when I was researching this, the purpose of research was execution sharding. So this was back when ethereum had ethereum 2.0. It was like, let's have 1024 execution charge on ethereum.
00:12:57.860 - 00:14:16.704, Speaker C: And it was kind of like this very complicated, very complicated proposals, but very complicated. And I actually had a co founded project called Chainspace, which was also a childhood system that was ACU hired by Facebook and that became part of the libra team. But I didn't join that team, and I started lazy ledgers to list it instead. But as part of that research I was doing, the core problem that it always boiled down to was, okay, we can shard the chain. You can add more execution shards, but how do we actually make it so that you can verify the behavior of your shards? Because what if one shard misbehaves? And then it came back down to, well, how do we prove data availability so that you can prove this behavior using for ability? Something was proposed in the Ethereum community by people like Vitalik. And then I decided I wanted to take this idea even further because I realized that that was actually the core primitive of blockchains. If you can scale this ability, you're basically scaling what the main purpose of blockchain is, which is ordering data and making it available and using that.
00:14:16.704 - 00:14:24.880, Speaker C: You don't have to embed sharding directly in your system. You can use roll ups because roll ups are basically execution shards for the population.
00:14:27.300 - 00:14:37.350, Speaker A: Ismail, I want to hear a little bit from you about kind of what got you inspired. Do you have any sort of ideas from the past that you feel like very much influenced your thinking around this?
00:14:38.620 - 00:15:29.510, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. When I worked with the core Cosmos team, I really much like the idea on how the state machine and the consensus is separated in software in the Cosmos SDK, which runs the state machine, and Tenement, which does the consensus. And when I understood Lazy Ledger back then for the first time, when I read the paper and talked to Mustafa and John about it, it's like, oh, this is basically a continuation of that paradigm. But instead of putting it separating that and abstracting it into software, it's basically a logical next step in abstracting that into different layers, essentially. So, yeah, this wasn't like my thinking around that.
00:15:29.880 - 00:15:53.790, Speaker A: Nice. Let's talk a little bit about the roll ups and kind of what the whole I mean, everything about, like, the build that was launched today is kind of that core that the roll ups will connect to. But yeah, tell us a little bit about the roll up landscape for Celestia today and how that came about. What tools did you need to build for people to be able to lock into your system?
00:15:55.680 - 00:16:48.080, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's a very kind of rapidly growing roll up ecosystem outside of Ethereum, specifically in the Cosmos ecosystem. When we were first building last year, we have an internal project called Roll Kit, which is kind of like a replacement tendon that allows you to create your own Cosmos chain, but without having to create your own validator set. You can replace Tenements with Volkit. So instead of having to create your own consensus network, you can just plug in some third party like Celestial for your consensus or database. And so that will allow you to launch Cosmos chains and roll ups. And you can use up today if you go to orcate dead. But since then, there's been a lot more roll up frameworks that have been developed that support sedestia and kind of like more not EVM centric, but they support arbitrary execution environments.
00:16:48.080 - 00:17:40.284, Speaker C: One of them is Dimension, which has a full control kit called diamond, and they actually have an incentivized testnet with around 700 roll ups running on Celestial. And because the ultimate goal here is we want to make deploying a roll up as easy as deploying a smart contract that's actually possible today with a lot of infrastructure that's being built out. Dimension is one of them. But there's also other projects called that kind of offer as a roll off as a service solution. So you can literally go on the website and fill out a form and immediately deploy a roll up. And you don't have to trust that service because it's a roll up with fraud proofs or GT proofs. We also have integrations with Opsack so you can deploy an Optimism roll up on Celestial.
00:17:40.284 - 00:18:03.012, Speaker C: And last week we also announced an integration with Arbitrum. So now you can deploy Arbitrum Orbit roll ups using Celestial. There's also various other roll up frameworks like the Sovereign SDK, which is pretty hall. They use Risk Zero, so you can deploy risk roll ups that use Celestia for DA as well.
00:18:03.146 - 00:18:28.624, Speaker A: Cool. I actually didn't realize that. I know the last time we talked on the show we talked a lot about roll kit and I didn't realize that there had been these sort of like variations on that roll kit being something where you can easily deploy a roll up. What you're talking about are kind of other SDKs that have been have they had to be modified to be able to work with Celestia? Like was there work that had to happen or were they kind of ready to use out of the yeah, like.
00:18:28.662 - 00:19:18.690, Speaker C: For the existing SDK frameworks, like Optimism, Arbitrum, we had to modify them so that you could use them for Celestial. But we're also working very closely with various follow up teams to kind of create a standardized data availability interface for these frameworks. So like for example, we've contributed modular data availability interface to Optimism that other daily are also now using and adopting. But for other frameworks they will kind of build ground up built from scratch. For some of them, Celestial is the first DNA they support. Like for example, like some of the SDK or Dynamic Volkit. And that's in many cases because they want to try and build something that just isn't feasible with the current Blob space that Ethereum might offer.
00:19:21.140 - 00:19:42.584, Speaker A: I just am curious here in terms of the roll ups. Do roll ups who want to engage already, I'm assuming they already have to be kind of ready to go. Are there already roll ups on Celestia now? Like it's day one, so I totally understand. If not, not on day one.
00:19:42.622 - 00:20:05.212, Speaker C: But there's various roll ups that have already deployed. They're currently on Mainnet now, but they originally deployed on Celestial testnet and one of them is Banter. So there's various roll ups that have been waiting for Celestial to launch mainnet so they can just switch over to Celestia. One of those is Banter. They're an off site roll up that have used our Celestial DA integration.
00:20:05.356 - 00:20:07.650, Speaker A: Who was it? I couldn't hear what you said.
00:20:08.020 - 00:20:12.080, Speaker C: It's called manta, which is like a ZK EVM chain.
00:20:14.340 - 00:20:20.210, Speaker A: Okay. Manta, that was like okay, polkadot polygon. Okay, that one.
00:20:21.060 - 00:20:23.196, Speaker C: No, it's like manta pacific.
00:20:23.388 - 00:20:47.800, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Okay, exactly. Got it. Yeah, I know that team. Cool. So there's a lot of these roll up teams who are I think, just to paraphrase what I think you just said was, like, there's been a lot of these teams already operating on testnet, and what are they waiting for to be able to move what they're doing over to the main net? And Ismail, feel free to jump in anytime.
00:20:48.880 - 00:21:22.650, Speaker B: I think most of them were just waiting for us or not for us, for the chain to be live. That's the first thing they were waiting mean. The second thing is, as Mustapha said, it's pretty experimental. I think a few teams might wait a bit until and experiment a bit more on testnet until they deem the network stable enough to actually deploy on mainnet as well. But, yeah, most of them have been just waiting on for us to be live. That's it.
00:21:25.020 - 00:21:43.150, Speaker C: In the meantime, there's been some fun people have been posting some fun things on the in blocks. Like someone posted the satoshi white paper satoshi white paper as a blob on Celestia and various other images as well. But maybe on those.
00:21:44.180 - 00:21:56.640, Speaker B: Yeah, satoshi white paper apparently an image of James Preswich. I don't know why, but someone found it and it's an image of James Preswich.
00:21:57.080 - 00:22:30.572, Speaker A: Nice. Forever enshrined, I guess, together with the bitcoin white paper. Yeah. Nice. What does this launch, do you think, mean for cosmos? It's a separate ecosystem, and it's inspired a lot, I know, by Cosmos, but it's also inspired a lot by ethereum. But I want to maybe first talk about the cosmos ecosystem. How does Celestia's launch? I know there's a lot of people in the ecosystem who've been very excited for it.
00:22:30.572 - 00:22:31.884, Speaker A: That's all I can say.
00:22:32.002 - 00:23:49.910, Speaker B: But, yeah, I think for Cosmos, it mainly means that you can use the Cosmos stack, which is like comet BFT, known as Tenement as well, and the Cosmos SDK to deploy something that goes beyond the actual original vision, which is just single chains with different security notions interacting with each other. It's pretty cool for me, having worked on that stack as well, to see, oh, you can actually build something that's potentially where you can deploy very different execution environments on top of that not related to Cosmos at all. So that's pretty awesome. I've said that in the past as well. For me, Cessa is a bit like what the Cosmos hub could have been because it comes directly with, like, here's a chain and here's a vision on how this chain can be useful for other chains, for other sovereign chains. Very clearly, right, like, from the beginning, there's a notion of shared security. I'm very excited to expand that ecosystem, basically.
00:23:51.640 - 00:23:55.160, Speaker A: Mustafa, what are your thoughts on the Cosmos connection.
00:23:55.820 - 00:24:48.120, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, Celestial is supposed to be synthesis between Ethereum and Cosmos in the sense that Cosmos was very forward thinking, in the sense that they had a multi chain division. Anyone could launch your own chain, but that didn't have shed security. But then back in the day, at the same time that Cosmos was launched, ethereum had these execution charts where it's also sort of multi chain ecosystem, but it had shared security. So Celestia is kind of a synthesis of these two visions where with Celestia, you can have the best of both worlds, where you can launch a sovereign chain, just like you can launch a sovereign Cosmos chain, but you can now have shared security, just like with the FBA.
00:24:49.820 - 00:25:09.570, Speaker A: Nice. What does it mean for Ethereum? You position yourself between them. But just looking from the ethereum state and I know we're actually going to talk in our next section a little bit about the Blob stream stuff. But yeah, tell us a little bit about how do you see Ethereum reacting to Celestia? How does Celestia fit in that?
00:25:11.620 - 00:25:38.890, Speaker C: I mean, mainly Celestia provides data block space to Ethereum via blockstream which will just consume. But one of the interesting things about Celestial is that, unlike Ethereum, it does not have an instrument smart contract environment. And so it's not a supplement layer like Ethereum, but only does data availability. So you can use another settlement theorem. If you need a settlement layer, you can use Ethereum for that and use Celestial for the eight.
00:25:41.360 - 00:26:07.090, Speaker A: Nice. I want to ask something. I don't know if it went out yet. I know there was going to be a tweet about this, but how people can already engage. What can people do? Right now? We know that the validators can run validators. We know that there's roll up teams who are about to deploy a roll up. But yeah, how can generally people engage with this?
00:26:07.940 - 00:26:41.550, Speaker C: Yeah, there's several ways to engage. You can kind of stake the tokens. You can run a light node that's very easy to do, be one of the first people to run data. And you can even deploy your own roll up. It's easy for users to even deploy their own roll up. If you go on the roll kit or dimension docs, you can do it very quickly, five minutes. You can actually deploy your own roll up and deploy a dow wherever you like.
00:26:42.880 - 00:27:13.640, Speaker A: Actually, this ismail, I think we did an interview in Paris a few months ago where it dawned on me what you were saying about these small roll ups. Like a roll up can also each application could have its own roll up. I had always thought of these roll ups as like, know, general purpose VM, kind of like an environment where people would deploy things on top. And it was in our conversation where you were like, no, each one roll ups become much more there's going to be a lot more of them, I guess.
00:27:13.710 - 00:28:08.200, Speaker B: Yeah. They can be like sovereign roll ups that have their own, like an own Cosmos zone, so to say, but with a shared notion of security. Right? Yeah. My dream is basically that also the tail end of applications that are currently either too expensive to deploy on Ethereum or too expensive to deploy in terms of work you put in and resources too expensive to deploy as its own chain will be feasible to be deployed on Celestial. So you think of that as the tail end of decentralized applications that are currently nowhere deployed because it's not feasible, not practical. And this, ideally, would become practical with Celestial.
00:28:08.780 - 00:28:09.288, Speaker A: Cool.
00:28:09.374 - 00:28:50.916, Speaker C: Yeah. There's around 700 roll ups on Dimension deployed that use Celestial. And there's kind of like various fun different roll ups that people are experimenting with. Like, there's various kind of games that people are playing with various different ideas as well. So you can check that as well if you want to see what people are experimenting with. But yeah, the ultimate idea is it's very similar to the web in the sense that just like how every organization or every community has its own website, and those websites or our communities, they don't all share the same server. They all employ those virtual machines on EC Two.
00:28:50.916 - 00:28:57.880, Speaker C: Anyone right now can go on EC Two, deploy their own virtual machine in five minutes and install whatever they want on it.
00:28:58.030 - 00:28:58.440, Speaker A: Wow.
00:28:58.510 - 00:29:21.968, Speaker C: So roll ups are very similar. Like, roll ups are like virtual blockchains. Instead of having to share execution environment with everyone, you can deploy your own virtual blockchain. And you're not limited to the EVM. You can do something that's more suitable for your application and experiment with that. Just like people can deploy virtual machines on the web.
00:29:22.134 - 00:29:36.150, Speaker A: Nice. So I guess what you're saying anyone can now, is this almost like a call to action for folks to go try this, to try it themselves? How complicated is it actually? How technical do you be to do this?
00:29:37.240 - 00:29:56.620, Speaker C: There's some services that made it extremely simple. One of them is called Vistara. You literally fill out a form, you click a button and it deploys a roll up for you. It's very easy. It's the same as deploying a merger, which is on DigitalOcean or ETP. You just fill out a form, click deploy, and it's deployed.
00:29:56.960 - 00:30:15.840, Speaker A: Crazy. But do you feel like most of the users, most of the roll up folks will actually be doing much more kind of custom roll ups? Is that sort of the thing you envision? Or do you actually envision these roll kit like things basically being like the most used format?
00:30:17.220 - 00:31:11.590, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the way I see it is that kind of like protocol developers will create different execution environments, but the actual users deploying those roll ups. They obviously are not necessarily going to be creating execution environments, but they're going to be using it. It's just like how you might deploy a virtual machine on DigitalOcean or EC Two, and you might install root like Python or Rust or Golang, or install a forum software like Discourse, or install a block software like Ghost. The users haven't created that software, but they can enable them thanks to Virtualization. Without virtualization, it wouldn't be possible because before virtual machines were popular on the web, people had to use shared web hosting providers like GeoCities or Bluehost, and they were only stuck with one environment, like PHP and My team.
00:31:15.000 - 00:31:33.210, Speaker A: But then eventually these kind of tools emerged where they didn't have to. I guess they had more options. I wonder, just like in other this is sort of an aside, but in Ethereum, is it possible to also just deploy like a small personal roll up? Could you do that?
00:31:33.580 - 00:32:17.530, Speaker C: Yeah, you can arbitrage Orbit or you can do with Opstack as well. Yes, it's still possible. It's just like with Ethereum, it's very expensive right now. Even with the IP 44, it only supports something like three blobs per block. So it's not like I think it's still only going to be suitable for these big general purpose roll ups. Yeah, because if you only fit three blobs per block with Celestial, there's no limit to how many blobs because Yaki bought it for four. You can only buy like 100 data at a time, but with Celestial you can buy a minimum of 500 bytes of data.
00:32:17.900 - 00:32:37.870, Speaker A: Cool. Nice. Well, folks, I want to say thank you to both of you for this interview and sharing with us a little bit about your experience in this launch and also kind of what people can do today, I think. Hector, you jumped on I don't know if Hector's still there. He jumped on for like a hello.
00:32:38.400 - 00:32:39.390, Speaker C: Hi, guys.
00:32:40.740 - 00:32:43.792, Speaker A: Yeah. Hector, is there any questions or anything to add here?
00:32:43.846 - 00:33:09.960, Speaker D: Yeah, actually there are two questions that I would like to ask you guys. The first one is what type of governance proposals can expect the community members to see on Celestia coming up in the next few weeks or a few months? We know that people from the community, especially in Cosmos, is very active on governance, so what can we expect in the sense of governance?
00:33:12.560 - 00:34:32.230, Speaker B: So we actually want to do like we want to have very little on chain governance. The philosophy is a bit different from what we used to on Cosmos, and it's more like what people are used to on Ethereum and Bitcoin. So to say, there will be like Celestial improvement proposal process which is put into place, and soon we'll have core dev calls with these improvement proposals. That's the main governance basically for the protocol and the onchain governance is literally very limited to things that are related to on chain governance. Like there's a community pool, there's a few parameters that can be changed, some of them related directly. To governance and others are like, for instance, you can increase the block size without hard forking or without upgrading the software via an on chain governance proposal up to a certain limit only. And then above that limit, you have to resort to the improvement proposal process.
00:34:32.230 - 00:35:14.770, Speaker B: So yeah, we don't know that. It's up to the community to govern the on chain parameters. I would recommend people, before submitting a proposal, obviously to read our specs and see which parameters are changeable via governance and whatnot and which not. And I would also recommend to check out the improvement proposal. There's a repository for that that only has like one or two improvement proposals, but that will be more active moving forward, I guess.
00:35:15.940 - 00:35:45.150, Speaker D: Thank you. That seems pretty interesting, like that switch, like the way you guys are going to handle governance. And then there is another question. I know you mentioned a couple of names here and there of people building on Celestia, but can you walk us through a little bit more through the Celestia ecosystem? Like what teams can we expect to be live on the coming months and so on?
00:35:50.000 - 00:36:10.672, Speaker C: Yeah, so if you go on our website, we actually have an ecosystem page where you can check out the various project ecosystem. There's like different categories of projects. There's role officer service providers. There's like five different role officer service providers that are going live on Sedestia. There's outlay. Caldera and Eclipse. Snapchain and Vistara.
00:36:10.672 - 00:37:01.412, Speaker C: There's also various shared sequencer networks, shared sequencing, that's been a hot topic Astria Fairblock Radius and also like various settlement layers. Neutron is one of them and others like Dimension and Bear Chain. And of course there's the roll up frameworks like Opsack and Bulky and Supplement SDK, which is what I mentioned. There's also various DeFi primitives interacting with suggestion. Some of them are as roll ups, like Present, for example. They deployed like a Dex roll up on yeah, and then there's cool experiments in gaming as well, especially with Argus and Curio. So for example, with Curio they're doing some cool experiments with they have a real time game engine.
00:37:01.412 - 00:37:17.210, Speaker C: They've managed to modify the EVM to have a real time game engine. They've managed to put like Warcraft on chain. And you wouldn't normally expect that because that's like a real time strategy. It's not like you have to do a transaction and then wait 10 seconds. It's like 0.5 seconds. And that's only possible.
00:37:17.210 - 00:37:24.270, Speaker C: That's possible due to we're using roll up sequences because roll ups can have faster block times than layer one themselves.
00:37:27.200 - 00:37:27.804, Speaker A: Nice.
00:37:27.922 - 00:37:28.876, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:37:29.058 - 00:37:51.232, Speaker A: Thanks Hector. All right, and thank you to both of you for this part of the kind of event and for sharing with us all of this info. And I guess the message from this very much is if you want to try deploying a roll up yourself, you can do it now. So maybe go do it. Very cool and congratulations. Actually, I want to say. I don't know.
00:37:51.232 - 00:38:02.470, Speaker A: Do you have a glass of anything? I want to definitely do a cheers to you both for putting this together. I know we're going to do it. We'll do another cheers later on. But I want to do a first cheers to you.
00:38:03.340 - 00:38:04.650, Speaker C: Empty glass here.
00:38:06.940 - 00:38:10.984, Speaker A: You guys are going to jump off. When you come back, bring full glasses. Okay, cool.
00:38:11.102 - 00:38:11.432, Speaker C: Okay.
00:38:11.486 - 00:38:11.844, Speaker A: All right.
00:38:11.902 - 00:38:13.608, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks a lot, Anna.
00:38:13.704 - 00:38:27.680, Speaker A: Bye bye. All right, so now we're going to invite to the stage evan and John Adler. Hey. Hello. Nice.
00:38:27.750 - 00:38:28.370, Speaker C: Hello.
00:38:28.980 - 00:38:44.150, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I didn't get to see your taglines. Okay. Evan, lead bug writer. My goodness. And John Tweets on occasion. Welcome to the stage and our spontaneous live event.
00:38:44.150 - 00:38:47.380, Speaker A: Yeah. It's really great to see you guys. How are you feeling?
00:38:49.900 - 00:39:26.412, Speaker E: I'm feeling amazing. I'm so happy to finally have it out. I'm excited to actually write more bugs and more features instead know, doing a lot of stability work. It feels rather routine, kind of like what Mustafa was discussing, where this was very rehearsed. We had done this a bunch. If it didn't work, I would be very we've we've done a lot of debugging on the testnets recently, so I was very confident in our ability to debug things if something did go wrong. So I felt really relaxed there.
00:39:26.412 - 00:39:57.400, Speaker E: And it feels like it's just the start just because we picked very conservative things, I think, at first. So we're using standard Tendermint and the Cosmos SDK and things like this. And now I think for future versions, as the community has just had a huge number of ideas that are just super exciting and we actually have users now, or we will have really excited and just happy, grateful.
00:39:57.480 - 00:40:08.720, Speaker A: Amazing. Evan, since you sort of started talking a little bit about the work you're doing, can you actually introduce yourself and tell us what you do other than write bugs?
00:40:10.100 - 00:40:37.800, Speaker E: Occasionally I do fix bugs as well. I'm a core developer. I was very lucky and happened to be one of the first engineers hired. So I have been working almost three years for mainly working on the application and ARF work of Tendermint or Comet, and that's pretty much it. I have also done a little bit of work on, of course, Blobstream.
00:40:40.060 - 00:40:48.508, Speaker A: Nice. John, you've actually been on my show a long time ago. This project was called ledger still. Yeah.
00:40:48.674 - 00:41:22.810, Speaker E: Oh, wait, wait. That was actually the first time that I heard about with John on that the at the I remember exactly where I was. I was going for a run, and I remember hearing John for the first time, and I was like, oh, John sounds smart. Oh, these are good takes on roll ups. This makes a lot of sense, right? And then at the end, John mentioned Lazy Ledger, and I remember vividly, and I stopped what I was doing and actually stopped running. I was like, oh my God, this is the way. And I actually went and applied right after that.
00:41:22.810 - 00:41:28.170, Speaker E: That's when I got hired, was because was on that podcast with John talking in my ear.
00:41:29.260 - 00:41:30.904, Speaker F: Epic world.
00:41:31.102 - 00:41:36.190, Speaker A: Wow. Crazy. Okay, john, why don't you introduce yourself?
00:41:36.960 - 00:41:37.324, Speaker C: Sure.
00:41:37.362 - 00:41:56.316, Speaker F: I'll reintroduce myself since I've been here before. I guess I'm a different podcast. So I'm john. I'm one of the co founders of Celestia. I direct protocol. Engineering at Celestia Labs. That means, I guess I'm responsible for doing our best to help out the node and core app teams.
00:41:56.316 - 00:41:59.810, Speaker F: Evan, of course, being one of the lead of the core app.
00:42:03.000 - 00:42:28.830, Speaker A: Mean, I think this section of the event we planned on talking about Blobstream, which we sort of mentioned and hinted at before we even start and describe what it is. Or actually, maybe we should describe what it is. But really, one of my burning questions is, like, what's up with the name Blobstream? Because it's something, but yeah, so let's describe what is Blobstream? What is it?
00:42:29.760 - 00:42:30.510, Speaker C: Sure.
00:42:31.600 - 00:42:34.912, Speaker F: So we'll describe it first, then we'll get to the name, if that's what you're saying.
00:42:35.046 - 00:42:35.680, Speaker A: Yes.
00:42:35.830 - 00:43:16.888, Speaker F: So it's essentially a one way attestation of data being available on Celestia to Ethereum. In the more generic case, you can say a Celestia like chain to an EVM chain. But in this particular case, we're talking about stationary relay from Celestia to Ethereum. And it's unidirectional, which makes it different than other bridges. Many other bridges or bridges, as people traditionally talk about them, are bi directional. So you can move assets to and from chains, things like IBC, Axelr, wormhole, et cetera. Sometimes you move them one way and then they get lost forever, like wormhole.
00:43:16.888 - 00:43:50.788, Speaker F: But usually they're supposed to go two ways. The Blobstream relay attestation relay is unidirectional, so it essentially allows contracts on Ethereum, such as things you would call layer, you know, variations of arbitrage, optimism, starkware. Those kind of protocols can use Celestia to post their data availability while still settling on Ethereum. That's essentially the TLDR of what it aims to achieve.
00:43:50.964 - 00:44:01.450, Speaker A: But you mentioned this, like, unidirectional. Okay, but you mentioned this unidirectional. What part of that is unidirectional? And are you deploying a smart contract on Ethereum yourself?
00:44:02.620 - 00:44:18.460, Speaker F: Yeah. So the unidirectional part is ancestions of data being available on Celestia are relayed to Ethereum in a completely trustless manner and permission one way, I guess, but nothing is sent back to Celestia.
00:44:18.540 - 00:44:18.832, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:18.886 - 00:44:29.590, Speaker F: So there's no assets, there's no messages, there's no just the Attestation that data is available on Celestia, is sent to Ethereum in that direction only.
00:44:30.040 - 00:44:39.280, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay. Now, what's up with the name? One of you has to take it.
00:44:41.170 - 00:45:07.194, Speaker E: As far as I understand. I believe the name is supposed to elicit something. It's kind of playful in the fact that it's like a stream. But just like John said, like a stream goes one way, it's unidirectional. I think the more technical term as at least how John first described it to me was it was a light client relay. So it's exactly what John just said, and it's Blobs. So it's like Ethereum at least.
00:45:07.194 - 00:45:20.730, Speaker E: Roll up developers are very familiar with what a Blob would be. The same exact concept applies to Celestia Blobs. So you're literally streaming Blobs from one chain to a different chain.
00:45:20.890 - 00:45:41.380, Speaker A: That's Blobstream. I think this works, but actually, can you describe I know we're going to actually keep this pretty short, but what is the Blob for non roll up developers? Is it a package of transactions that are being kind of sent? What is it exactly?
00:45:41.750 - 00:45:45.126, Speaker E: It's literally arbitrary bytes of data.
00:45:45.308 - 00:45:46.040, Speaker A: Okay.
00:45:47.290 - 00:46:21.070, Speaker E: The smallest Blob on Celestia is about 500 bytes, and the largest ones at the moment that you can get is the size of the block, which is about two megabytes. But the block size will almost certainly increase in the future depending on what the community decides. And the Blob can be as big as whatever the block is. Completely arbitrary, literally anything. Like, you can have images of James Prestwich if you want. That's a great example of a Blob, another Blob.
00:46:23.250 - 00:46:24.570, Speaker A: Say that again, Josh.
00:46:24.730 - 00:47:02.762, Speaker F: Or you could have the bitcoin white paper. But also in the context of a L2, the contents of the Blob would, for example, be the block for that L2. So if it's like an EVM based L two, like Arbitrum, for instance, it would be, for example, the Arbitrum problem, one block in the Arbitrum chain. That would be an example of something you could put in there. But as Evan said, it doesn't have to just be that. It's completely uninterpreted data. And this is one of the value propositions of Celestia, right? It doesn't execute blobs.
00:47:02.762 - 00:47:34.310, Speaker F: It doesn't execute these quote unquote transactions. It just orders them. So it takes the zeros and ones and puts them in the Celestia Blob, but doesn't actually execute them. So from Celestia's perspective, it can be anything because it doesn't actually care what it is. So it could be an image. If you're doing something like some sharing social media, something like that, it could be some sort of machine learning model. You could put the weights there, might be a bit big, or it could be the block of a blockchain.
00:47:35.930 - 00:47:54.510, Speaker A: But in the case of Blob stream, what is being sent? Maybe can you walk through that again? Because now that I sort of understand what a Blob is, you were saying sort of this unidirectional Attestation. Is that the Blob? Is it a blob of attestation?
00:47:56.610 - 00:48:13.326, Speaker F: So not exactly. Now we're getting into implementation details. What's really being relayed over is not the Blobs themselves, but rather commitments, which you can think of, like hashes commitments to Blobs, because a commitment uniquely identifies its pre image.
00:48:13.358 - 00:48:13.602, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:13.656 - 00:48:35.750, Speaker F: You'll uniquely identify a Blob, but you don't have to really relay in fact, you probably shouldn't relay the entire Blob over to Ethereum because that would be very expensive. So you just relay the hash of the Blob. Or we want to get very technical and more into the weeds, more into the implementation details. You relay the merkel route of commitments to Blob, so you relay them patches.
00:48:35.910 - 00:48:36.426, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:36.528 - 00:48:38.170, Speaker F: To save even more gas.
00:48:38.670 - 00:48:52.260, Speaker A: This is the data availability basically being brought, as far as I can see, to the Ethereum network, kind of like larger network. But is this specifically for the L two S or is it for the main chain as well?
00:48:56.650 - 00:49:00.870, Speaker E: I'm not quite sure what is meant for the main chain.
00:49:03.050 - 00:49:20.590, Speaker A: Ethereum main net, like the base Ethereum? Or is it just for the L two S living on Ethereum Attestation? Would you use it from Celestia testing to something on Ethereum being deployed directly on Ethereum or just on just the roll ups?
00:49:21.250 - 00:49:29.770, Speaker E: The Attestation is of course, over all the block data in Celestia and that goes presumably to the contract on Ethereum.
00:49:29.930 - 00:49:30.350, Speaker A: Okay.
00:49:30.420 - 00:49:41.410, Speaker E: And then the roll ups will post their block data to Celestia and then they prove when they need to, depending on the roll up, they prove the inclusion on Ethereum. So on the blockstream.
00:49:41.910 - 00:50:01.850, Speaker A: Yeah. So but I guess I'm kind of like trying to figure out who's the customer for this. And I know it's not really a customer, but it's the roll ups. From what I understand, it's the roll ups who want this data availability extra. It's not the Ethereum main chain that's using this for its own data availability because I guess it has it built in, right?
00:50:02.000 - 00:50:02.810, Speaker E: Yes, definitely.
00:50:02.880 - 00:50:05.818, Speaker A: The L two S. Okay, got it.
00:50:05.904 - 00:50:49.078, Speaker F: Yeah, that's correct. And we've seen a lot of excitement among the various L two S to greatly increase their capacity for data availability because Ethereum as it exists today, it kind of has the throughput of dial up Internet. Meanwhile, Celestia as it's launched, has the throughput of broadband and potentially in the future as block sizes increase and could easily go up to fiber speeds potentially comparative orders of magnitude. So various L two S have had a lot of excitement around the possibility of having much higher data throughput which can unlock broader range of applications for lower costs, et cetera.
00:50:49.254 - 00:51:10.738, Speaker A: Cool. I don't know if this goes a little bit outside of the scope of this interview, but I know when the Zkv team, when we were talking about this interview, it came up. We know that Succinct is doing something with you guys, blockstream X. Can you share a little bit about that? Also? If it is out of scope, just say so. But yeah, I wondered if we could talk a bit about it.
00:51:10.904 - 00:52:15.954, Speaker E: No, definitely not. I think the Blobstream X is potentially the future of Blobstream. So currently Blobstream works as the validators are signing using a different key. And the reason why they have to use a different key is because of gas. Like it just costs a lot of gas to use the standard key that we use in Tendermint or the standard curve but with Blobstream X is they actually just throw a Stark over everything and prove it natively. So there's a few different advantages to that besides the fact that the validators only have to sign using one key. That's one huge advantage but it's easier to prove things like equivocation, like double signing things like Liveness and perhaps most importantly from a user perspective lobstream X enables or will have this sort of server and response model whereas now we sort of have relay commitments at a consistent time period.
00:52:15.954 - 00:52:35.340, Speaker E: So like every so often we'll just constantly relay commitments where with Blobstream X, like for example if it gets very busy or if there is enough demand for it you can push it even faster and you don't need any permission to do any of that as long as you create a valid proof, it's good.
00:52:35.950 - 00:52:49.600, Speaker A: I want to just go back to something you said right at the beginning of that you sort of said you could prove it natively but I didn't actually know where natively. Can you say where is it happening? Is that on ethereum? Yeah or on the L two?
00:52:50.610 - 00:53:11.670, Speaker E: No, by proof natively I think I was referring to that you would have the exact same signatures that are in the commit of like the Tendermint header those exact same signatures are being verified in the Stark which I think is Snarked or something on top and then included in the Blobstream contracts.
00:53:12.010 - 00:53:18.342, Speaker A: Okay, I guess I don't really know what the other version yeah, I was.
00:53:18.396 - 00:53:23.450, Speaker E: Probably getting far into the details and that was probably a mistake I wasn't going high level enough.
00:53:23.600 - 00:53:48.580, Speaker A: No problem. Yeah I'm sorry I'm not deep in the weeds enough to be able to follow up but yeah, I think for me at least well, actually is there anything else that you feel like the audience should know about Blobstream? Because if not I think we actually have a couple of questions but let's first see is there anything else that you think they should know? Can they already engage with it? Should roll ups be using it?
00:53:50.070 - 00:55:10.750, Speaker F: Yeah so with respect to engaging with it is not currently live on Mainet. That being said, the Blobstream architecture due to the fact that it's unidirectional and there's no assets involved unlike other bridges it means that there's no form of custody. Other bridges like the bridge contracts or the bridge operators can be considered as custody of the fontans. In this case there's no funds, it's unidirectional, so there's no custody which leads to the very nice property that relaying of these Attestations is completely permissionless and also completely trustless. You only have to quote unquote trust the celestial validator set as long as that is honest. Whoever relays the Attestations, you don't have to trust them because they can't forge signatures assuming they don't have a very powerful computer. And this also leads us to potentially the next point, which is that one of the benefits and very important advantages of Blobstream or Blobstream like systems over the kind of short term solution that some L two S have been looking into called Data Availability Committees and also restaking type data solutions.
00:55:10.750 - 00:55:36.690, Speaker F: Those Data Availability Committees and restaking, those do not support slashing, or rather they don't support slashing without trusting some other set of people. And that's because for, let's say, a Data Availability Committee, how would you slash them? They're just, let's say, seven trusted parties. There's no mechanism for penalizing them. They don't even have to put up a bond.
00:55:36.770 - 00:55:37.910, Speaker A: There's no stake.
00:55:38.650 - 00:56:18.050, Speaker F: There's no stake for restaking, okay? You can say they're staked. So we can slash them except because of the fact that you don't want native stakers to also fully validate everything that's being restaked. Otherwise it's not restaking, it just like a block size increase. Essentially, you can't expect native stakers to slash the Restakers if they do something malicious. So how do you slash them? You can only slash them by invoking ultimately token holder governance. So protocols like Eigen layer, for instance, how would they slash Restakers? That misbehave. Well, you need the Eigen layer token, and the majority of token holders have to vote on something.
00:56:18.050 - 00:57:16.150, Speaker F: Well, that's not the same security model as, let's say, Ethereum, or even if the majority of Ethereum validators Equivocate, or if they sign over a malicious block, they are not going to trick nodes. That assuming, of course, the implantation of fraud groups, et cetera. They're not going to trick nodes, especially they're not going to trick full nodes. They will get slashed, but they won't get slashed inside of consensus. They'll get slashed through social consensus because that is the ultimate kind of guardian of these protocols. So with a protocol like Blobstream, the nice thing is that since Celestia is a layer one, the Celestia community can get community can get together and slash Celestia validators, even if the majority of them sign over some malicious block or sign over a block that is not available, for example. So this is like an additional crypto economic security guarantee that is impossible to achieve with Data Availability Committees or restaking.
00:57:18.970 - 00:57:38.720, Speaker A: Nice. Cool. All right, thank you for sharing with us a lot about this kind of upcoming part of the Celestia stack, I guess you could call it. I don't know if you already shared this, but is there a timeframe for when we can actually use or when teams can actually engage with this?
00:57:42.050 - 00:58:03.986, Speaker E: I believe that we already have versions live on our testnets. So on the Arabica testnet, I believe we already have it live. We will have it live soon. TM on the other test net on Mocha. So within a month, I think is a very safe bet. And then for mainnet, I believe that's just up to the community. I have no clue when that would.
00:58:04.008 - 00:58:16.874, Speaker F: Be because both deploying the contract and operating the relay is completely trustless and completely permissionless. It's up to the community to start running this, essentially. But please don't start running it now.
00:58:16.912 - 00:58:18.940, Speaker A: Because it's not ready.
00:58:20.590 - 00:58:21.914, Speaker F: Audited first.
00:58:22.112 - 00:58:34.030, Speaker A: Sounds good. All right, thank you. Thank you for this interview. Thanks to both of you. Let's see if I don't know if Hector, if I actually saw a couple of questions, so yeah, I wondered if you want to share.
00:58:34.100 - 00:58:34.430, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:34.500 - 00:58:58.694, Speaker D: Hi, guys. One of the question is I don't think it's related to Blobstream, but since we are CK validator, I think it's fair to ask it. Can Celestia have a fully private roll up on it? That's a question that someone is asking on the chat. And I think since we are CK validator, why not ask?
00:58:58.812 - 00:58:59.480, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:01.210 - 00:59:15.020, Speaker E: Definitely. You can, of course, have a private roll up. You can build whatever, the execution, the actual logic that goes over the block bytes or the bytes in the block is completely arbitrary, which is kind of amazing.
00:59:16.750 - 00:59:17.210, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:59:17.280 - 00:59:17.770, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:59:17.840 - 00:59:43.350, Speaker F: Basically, if you can build something, then you can build it on Celestia. I used to call Celestia, like, a universal something. I forget exactly what, but as Evan says, you can build whatever. So if someone tells you, oh, I can build a private roll up on System XYZ, you can build it on Celestia as well. Celestia allows you to literally build anything. You can build on any other protocol.
00:59:44.250 - 00:59:44.950, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:59:45.100 - 00:59:58.250, Speaker D: And another question is Blobstream. Right now it's focused on ethereum, but will it be available for any other ecosystems in the future, or it's only focusing on ethereum.
00:59:59.710 - 01:00:40.294, Speaker F: So the nice thing, like I said, because everything is trustless and permissionless, there's nothing stopping anyone from, say, forking the solidity code and, let's say, porting it to Rust and running it on Solana. There's nothing stopping anyone from doing that. And there's also nothing stopping anyone from relaying attestations from Celestia to any chain of their choice. EEG salana. It's all trustless and permissionless, and the code is all open source, so you can take the code and put it on another blockchain that's not EVM, and it'll still work. And this won't require any permission, even from the Celestia Validators. You can just take the signatures that are there.
01:00:40.294 - 01:00:42.920, Speaker F: You take the signatures and just put them on a different channel.
01:00:43.770 - 01:00:44.760, Speaker D: Thank you.
01:00:48.330 - 01:01:08.590, Speaker A: All right. Nice. I know that. Yeah. So I guess, Hector, thank you for those questions. Someone had actually suggested another name, quantum Gravity Bridge. I guess this is an old is this sort of like what it used to be or something? Okay.
01:01:08.590 - 01:01:33.190, Speaker A: Got it. But yeah. Thanks so much for sharing with us this insight into what this is. And yeah, and congrats to you. I actually think now would be a great time to invite all of the folks who are here kind of backstage with us back on the stage to do maybe, like, a bit of a cheers. We want to say congrats to everyone. Yeah.
01:01:33.190 - 01:01:41.514, Speaker A: Maybe if you're okay. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. Here's everybody who's been backstage this whole time. Very cool. Yeah.
01:01:41.514 - 01:01:54.334, Speaker A: I think we're hosting this from the ZK Validator. We're going to be very active in the Celestia ecosystem. We already have been. We've been on the testnet. We've been part of the incentivized testnet. We actually ranked. Yeah.
01:01:54.334 - 01:02:15.080, Speaker A: We're really excited to see this happening. We're so excited to be able to celebrate this with all of you. I guess we can now raise our cup. Mustafa, I saw you filled it up. Very good. Congrats to the entire team for all the work that you did. I can just imagine that you feel a lot of relief and excitement, but obviously there's still a lot coming.
01:02:15.080 - 01:02:36.090, Speaker A: So yeah, since I see a few folks from kind of the community side, like Yaz, it was actually, I think, you and I who kind of brainstormed this to do this event. But yeah. Tell us a little bit what to expect from the community or what's next? Is there any events we should be looking out for? Is there anything on the horizon?
01:02:37.710 - 01:02:55.970, Speaker B: Yeah, so DevConnect is coming up, so we have a lot of exciting events happening. We got game night. It's going to happen at the Istanbul Cistern. It's like a really beautiful venue. Very historic. We're going to have a lot of on chain games, a lot of board games. Super Smash Bros.
01:02:55.970 - 01:03:23.094, Speaker B: And we're also participating in Istanbul. There'll be a hackathon with a bunch of bounties happening. So, yeah, it would be really exciting in terms of events long term from the community side. Ismail mentioned the celestial improvement proposal process, so everyone look out for that. We're going to kick start that soon with the core devs. It's going to be really big moment for Celestia. Really excited.
01:03:23.142 - 01:03:37.134, Speaker A: Very cool. Amazing. And hi, Renee. We just wanted to bring you on because we're friends. Congratulations. Thank you. Nice.
01:03:37.134 - 01:04:03.240, Speaker A: All right, well, I think that mostly wraps up. I don't know if anyone else has anything left to say. If people are looking for Validators to stake to and you like what we do, please do stake to us. We're called ZK Validator just so you know that it's actually a different company from the podcast behind me. Thank you. Validator is the group that's hosting this. But yeah, please do stake to us if you can.
01:04:03.240 - 01:04:08.598, Speaker A: And I don't know if we have anything else to say, so I guess we'll sign off. Thanks, everybody.
01:04:08.764 - 01:04:09.846, Speaker B: Bye. Thanks again.
01:04:09.948 - 01:04:10.274, Speaker C: Bye.
01:04:10.322 - 01:04:10.854, Speaker A: Congrats again.
01:04:10.892 - 01:04:11.540, Speaker E: Thanks for having us.
