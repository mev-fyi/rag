00:00:07.290 - 00:00:47.820, Speaker A: Welcome to Zero Knowledge, a podcast where we talk about the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web. The show is hosted by me Anna and me Frederick. In this week's episode, we have a special crossover episode between this podcast and the Uncommon Core podcast. Hasu Tarun and I will be discussing the emergence of governance tokens and share a play by play recap of the Sushi swap saga. To date. Part one of this will be on this channel and part two will be on the Uncommon Core podcast. So be sure to check out both.
00:00:47.820 - 00:01:36.278, Speaker A: Just a quick note, the majority of this episode was recorded the day before the uniswap Token launch, so we added a short amendment at the end to capture this. But before we start in, I want to say a big thank you to this week's sponsor, Least Authority. Least Authority is a security consulting company known for their work on privacy respecting solutions. They are a team of security researchers, open source developers, privacy advocates and cryptographers. They specialize in security audits, design, specification reviews and security by design. They're most known for these security reviews, which includes work with zero knowledge proof systems as well as having implemented zero knowledge access passes with the distributed storage systems. Tahoe Laughs it seems fitting then that they are now working on a step by step guide for building ZK Snarks.
00:01:36.278 - 00:02:10.534, Speaker A: It's called the Moon Math Manual, which you can find and donate to on Gitcoin right now. In fact, as an aside, the Zero Knowledge podcast also has a grant on Gitcoin. And so that gives you two reasons to head over to Gitcoin.com during the clr matching and donate. If you are interested in working with Least Authority on anything zero knowledge related, do reach out to them. Whether you want an audit on your project, want to collaborate on security research, or even if you just want to learn about ZK proofs, they would like to hear from you. I've added the email in the show notes or you can also visit them@leastauthority.com.
00:02:10.534 - 00:02:46.702, Speaker A: So thank you again. Least authority. Now here is the SushiSwap saga with Hasu, Tarun and myself. So for this episode, we have a special crossover episode planned today. We have Hasu on the call or actually it's hasu and I are going to be doing this podcast together. The first part is going to air on the ZK podcast and the second part is going to air on Uncommon Core Hasu's podcast. Oh yes, and our special guest is the sometimes guest host of the ZK podcast.
00:02:46.702 - 00:02:50.450, Speaker A: I know he's been also on Uncommon Core. Tarun, welcome back.
00:02:50.600 - 00:03:03.346, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. I think the crossover episode thing is totally a throwback to the when, you know, different TV shows would have one character show up in another one's episode.
00:03:03.458 - 00:03:06.326, Speaker A: I know the universes are colliding a little bit for people.
00:03:06.428 - 00:03:07.080, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:08.970 - 00:03:14.518, Speaker A: We have the ZK folks and the actually, how would you describe your audience?
00:03:14.614 - 00:03:16.460, Speaker C: I have no idea, to be honest.
00:03:16.990 - 00:03:18.838, Speaker A: I think everybody should be pretty technical.
00:03:18.934 - 00:03:20.650, Speaker C: People who follow me on Twitter.
00:03:22.270 - 00:03:32.926, Speaker A: The point of this episode is actually we're going to be talking about governance tokens and diving into the recent events around the Sushi swap. What do we call that? Vampire attack.
00:03:33.108 - 00:03:35.482, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess that's the simplest.
00:03:35.546 - 00:03:38.434, Speaker A: Or the Sushi swap events or something.
00:03:38.552 - 00:03:51.318, Speaker C: Takeover attempt. I mean, yeah, I think the term vampire attack is actually quite nice when it refers specifically to draining liquidity or capital from another project, which was the case here.
00:03:51.484 - 00:04:03.674, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think maybe to kick off, we should all very briefly introduce ourselves for any new listeners who might be hearing this podcast for the first time, or anyone who isn't familiar with you guys yet. So, Hasu, do you want to start?
00:04:03.712 - 00:04:34.100, Speaker C: Sure. So, yeah, I guess most people would know me from Twitter, where I'm pretty active. I'm a researcher in the space. I've done some longer form research, mostly into the security of layer one blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, but I also run the research desk for Derrybit Insights, do that together with Suzu, who's also my co host at the Uncommon Core podcast, which will air the second part of this episode. And I hope you are going to check it out.
00:04:34.550 - 00:04:41.346, Speaker A: We'll be adding a link to this in the show notes to anyone who's listening. So for sure you're going to be able to hear part two. And how about you, Tarun?
00:04:41.538 - 00:05:08.094, Speaker B: I'm the founder of a company called Gauntlet. We do sort of multi agent simulation to stress test DeFi protocols and proof of stake protocols. When I say multi agent simulation, think like AlphaGo or, you know, previously I worked in finance and hardware, so I've kind of somehow been in the intersection of this stuff and have spent a bunch of time writing some of the early peer reviewed papers of understanding why a lot of DeFi protocols, actually.
00:05:08.132 - 00:05:33.160, Speaker C: You might know Tarun from his paper on how DeFi can actually challenge the security of proof of stake networks by creating higher yield opportunities. And that leading to and that's the segue to this episode, actually a vampire attack. So how mad are you, Tarun, that you didn't come up with the name vampire attack? Because you basically described this 100%.
00:05:34.010 - 00:05:57.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's more I'm not the meme type of person. I'm just not good at coming up with memes. I guess I should feel kind of bad. Maybe my Halloween costume is going to be a vampire this year, but I'm happy. Something that was meant to be an academic exercise to convince cryptographers that these types of attacks can happen turned out to happen in practice.
00:05:57.802 - 00:05:58.922, Speaker A: It's now a meme.
00:05:59.066 - 00:06:06.226, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ETH two is certainly going to be that launch is going to be very exciting because of this type of stuff.
00:06:06.408 - 00:06:10.046, Speaker C: So you think that E two is a vampire attack? On DFI.
00:06:10.238 - 00:06:16.030, Speaker B: Oh, e two might be a vampire attack on DFI. It's also sort of a vampire attack on miners.
00:06:16.110 - 00:06:16.494, Speaker C: Totally.
00:06:16.542 - 00:06:33.658, Speaker B: In some ways the difficulty bomb is a little bit like yeah. So I think it's going to be great to talk about this stuff because I think the next generation of networks are sort of going to have to grapple with this at the layer one level. Wow. Anna, you run a validator that aims to support zero knowledge research.
00:06:33.744 - 00:06:34.474, Speaker A: It's true.
00:06:34.592 - 00:06:41.574, Speaker B: How do you feel about vampire tax? As someone who's like running infrastructure that potentially could get attacked?
00:06:41.622 - 00:06:51.674, Speaker A: I'm Anna to anyone who's kind of new to this episode. I'm the co host of this podcast. I do something called the ZK Summit. I do a lot of things with ZK at the beginning of them. And one of them is the ZK.
00:06:51.722 - 00:06:53.774, Speaker C: Validator, a Twitter user.
00:06:53.902 - 00:07:30.314, Speaker A: And I'm also a Twitter user. I have been cited as a Twitter user in a publication. Actually. The thing is the ZK Validator, we get to actually work across a bunch of different networks. And to your mean, I think at this period in time there is know funds are being generated through the validation action, but we are obviously looking very closely at what DeFi is doing and how that might be interacting in the future. So yeah, I would say like I'm keeping an eye on it, ready to pounce whenever there's a great opportunity. I don't know.
00:07:30.352 - 00:07:38.880, Speaker C: So you would only do validation with the funds or would you also explore other opportunities with the money that could potentially get a higher yield to your customers?
00:07:39.730 - 00:08:26.910, Speaker A: Yeah, so here's the thing with the validator that I'm doing is actually we have no tokens, basically no tokens of our own. We're a community funded. All of the funds are generated through the commission from the validation for other people. So in a way, if we find opportunities where people can actually potentially validate or do something like validation through us, and we can use some sort of commission to fund the zero knowledge research, advocacy and all of the work that we're doing around that, then we would. And we assume that the people who are staking to us on some networks, if they happen to have other kinds of tokens, they might be interested in also supporting it there. So I don't necessarily see it as like a deep threat, but it's going to be interesting to see how it evolves. Anyway, that's our intros.
00:08:26.910 - 00:08:39.010, Speaker A: But let's move on to the main topic of this episode, which is going to be about governance tokens and specifically the SushiSwap attack. So let's first define governance tokens, maybe Tarun, you want to do that?
00:08:39.160 - 00:09:29.854, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So I think the correct way to think about governance tokens is imagine that you own equity in a company and it's like shares in a company, like stock. What do you do with your stock? Well, one is you hold it and hope for number go up. But number two, which is way more important in the normal world until sort of now has been much less important in crypto, is you use those shares to vote on governance changes. And so proof of stake protocols, I think in particular have spent years over engineering to some extent governance protocols so that they're adversary resistant in a lot of ways, but no one uses those protocols or votes in their governance. There's just no usage and so you didn't really see many people actually exercising those votes.
00:09:29.854 - 00:10:41.786, Speaker B: Governance tokens, however, in DeFi correspond to smart contracts that are acting as banks to some extent giving users equity in the protocol. And that equity, these tokens it gives out allows you to vote on parameter changes. So you can vote on changing the interest rate curve, you can vote on changing the emissions, how fast it gives out equity, you can vote on what types of collateral are allowed to be used. And these governance tokens, unlike shares, unlike a stock, let you vote on code that gets executed. And so this is the first people in the cryptocurrency space to really talk about this were probably Tezos in 2014 or 13 and their system can execute this, but no one really cares. There's a very small set of voters and very small set of proposals in proof of stake governance because a lot of proof of stake coins are their own governance token. And what we found is that in DeFi because people are voting on cash flows whether explicitly or implicitly and the implicit is usually because no one wants to be called a security.
00:10:41.786 - 00:11:57.714, Speaker B: And so if you say that these tokens have rights to cash flows or securities automatically, so you say they're valueless tokens that only are used to change parameters and vote on changes to parameters to these protocols. But a lot of them, I'd say, let you execute changes in code. And why this is sort of revolutionary versus evolutionary is in the normal market, if you own 10% of Goldman Sachs shares and you want to say hey Goldman, I want you to do a buyback because this share price is too low, I want you, the company to go buy stock on the open market, increase the price. You have to propose a new board of director, like a new director for the board, you have to get people to vote that director in, that director has to go convince the company and the CEO and management to go do a buyback and then they have to do the buyback. That process can take forever and involves a lot of politics. Whereas with governance tokens, people can just vote based on the amount of tokens they have on doing a buyback as a piece of code and then once the code is voted on, it gets executed. And it's a much more efficient way to do certain types of processes that exist in the normal market.
00:11:57.832 - 00:12:08.482, Speaker A: But governance tokens in this context, they're not pure like you just sort of said that. It's like they're not actually valueless that's an SEC avoided.
00:12:08.546 - 00:12:25.050, Speaker C: I've never understood this meme that governance tokens are valueless because if you have a token that can vote to direct yourself dividends like a stock, then it's of course not valueless. Right, but the sum of all these governance tokens is actually all of the future revenue of the protocol.
00:12:26.430 - 00:12:42.394, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's all avoiding the SEC coming after you mechanism to say they're valueless. That has nothing to do with the truth of them being valueful or not. A lot of proof of stake protocols got in trouble with this and they have a weird tax classification.
00:12:42.522 - 00:13:39.780, Speaker C: I want to go back to something that you said. So you said it's revolutionary that in governance tokens, basically the votes can vote directly on any decisions that are implemented by the company protocol. And it seems to me like this is basically the distinction between direct democracy in crypto where each share is like one vote and whatever the votes directly decide it's going to be implemented. And representative democracy, which you would have in a traditional company where the votes basically vote for a representative and that representative can then go and do that thing, but they are largely left unchecked most of the time. So do you think that the direct democracy is actually the better form of governance or do you think that this is also unscalable for the same reasons why direct democracy has never scaled in the traditional world and thus we in crypto will also end up with representative democracy governance in the long run.
00:13:40.390 - 00:14:36.500, Speaker B: I think that the correct way to at least the way I think about it is for financial decisions like buybacks, it was actually just hard to mechanically do direct democracy. If you think about how share buybacks work, it's like a really convoluted process created in the 1930s and every exchange in the world adheres to it in the same way. We see a lot of copy pasta DFI protocols as we're going to talk about with sushi swap. There's a lot of copy pasta legislation that has happened for exchanges and basically there's no technology to do most of this stuff. And part of it has to do with regulators kind of being slow and not adopting technology and part of it has to do with inertia on the part of exchanges and companies because they don't want the extra scrutiny. And I think that this is revolutionary in the sense that it's like forced the issue.
00:14:37.030 - 00:14:53.622, Speaker A: And actually what we're about to hear is we're going to basically be covering a story of quite the opposite of what you just described, something that moved extremely quickly. I mean, the entire story is we're kind of going to think about it a bit like a case study, but it all happened within a three week period ish.
00:14:53.766 - 00:15:26.340, Speaker C: I think that in itself shows why people should pay attention to DFI and ethereum. Because in this space, the thing that wasn't able to happen in the last 90 years in traditional finance for a variety of reasons, you can just go and do it here, there's no one to stop you. And if you're anonymous, then there's also, even if you do it, there's no one to come after you later, even if it blows up. So I think that's why we see all these fascinating experiments play out.
00:15:27.050 - 00:16:06.590, Speaker A: So let's introduce sort of the players in this scenario. Let's actually start with uniswap. Uniswap is a decentralized exchange where tokens can be sort of traded back and forth without a centralized middle person. And you can also provide liquidity to uniswap by basically providing both sides of a trade. So you can put a certain amount of ETH and a certain amount of another token. That's how uniswap exists. They don't have a governance token and so far, as far as we know, don't necessarily have public plans for a governance token unless something's been announced.
00:16:06.590 - 00:16:22.834, Speaker A: But I don't think so. Right, okay. So the way that people are actually rewarded for providing this liquidity is to charge a liquidity fee that is then given back to the liquidity providers. So in the form of the tokens that they actually put up, not in any other sort of token.
00:16:22.882 - 00:16:34.310, Speaker C: Yeah, right. So as a liquidity provider, when someone basically trades against you, then you get 0.3% of that trade as a liquidity.
00:16:34.470 - 00:16:37.046, Speaker B: Provider fee, is that always fixed?
00:16:37.078 - 00:16:38.214, Speaker A: Actually with uniswap?
00:16:38.342 - 00:16:39.690, Speaker C: That is always fixed.
00:16:40.190 - 00:16:43.518, Speaker B: For uniswap it is. For a lot of the other protocols it's not.
00:16:43.604 - 00:17:04.260, Speaker A: So this model of kind of incentivizing people to provide liquidity that started definitely to pick up steam, at what point was this idea of instead of only providing and dealing out that liquidity to the liquidity providers, at what point did somebody think about introducing a second token to that model?
00:17:05.110 - 00:17:55.214, Speaker B: So actually the sushi swap concept of adding a token has existed in other competitors uniswap earlier. So Bancorp, which is famous for its kind of failed, I mean, failed in the sense that they raised hundreds of millions of dollars and delivered basically a useless product and then eventually they kind of stumbled their way into copying uniswap. Bancorp had this thing where they added a token to try to incentivize people to move to Bancor. And the idea is that one of the kind of very weird properties of these uniswap types of automated market makers, they're called constant function market makers. And the reason for that is on each trade you preserve an invariant which is that you have to keep a certain function constant. There's some details as to whether that's really true or not. It actually only has to be strictly increasing.
00:17:55.214 - 00:18:31.360, Speaker B: But the interesting thing about these kind of constructs is that they have a type of loss that a lot of users are not familiar with when they trade on a centralized exchange. And this loss is called lack of creativity. People called it impermanent loss, which is kind of stupid in some sense because you still lost money. It's kind of weird to call a loss impermanent. But the reason for this is that Uniswap itself kind of acts as an options underwriter. It's really selling you something that's a little bit weird when you're a liquidity provider. It's selling you what's sort of a straddle in options.
00:18:31.360 - 00:18:56.678, Speaker B: And so you pay what options traders would call the Greeks to hold that position. And so people, once they started using Uniswap, realized that for certain assets, it's actually really bad. Like this loss can dwarf you're earning fees on every trade. But the loss can be quite large in normal finance. By the way, this thing has existed for a long time. It's called volatility harvesting. But crypto is very good at reinventing things.
00:18:56.678 - 00:19:59.110, Speaker B: So this loss, people sort of in kind of March and April of this year were like, hey, how do we subsidize this loss so that we get as much liquidity as people have on centralized order books or as much liquidity as Uniswap has. And so the history is actually Bancorp trying to claw their way out of a bunch of getting hacked a bunch of times and copying stuff, decided to kind of add in a token to compensate you for this loss. So you stake your liquidity provider share and you get this token. But around the same time Bancor did this, synthetix, which is this derivatives platform on Ethereum, also created this contract that became the ultimate copy pasta of the FoodCoin revolution, including SushiSwap, which is the synthetics reward contract. Synthetixreward Sol is probably the most copied contract in the last few months. And what it does is it lets you do the following. You provide liquidity to a uniswap pool, so you provide Ethereum and SUSD.
00:19:59.110 - 00:20:22.286, Speaker B: That's like synthetics dollar coin. When you provide liquidity to a uniswap pool, you get minted shares. The shares represent what percentage of the pool you own. So let's say you own 10% of the pool. You'll get 10% of the shares and the pool basically automatically mints and burns shares. So when you withdraw money, it buys your shares back and destroys them. And when you add liquidity, it mints shares.
00:20:22.286 - 00:20:59.274, Speaker B: Once you get the shares, the shares are kind of your voucher for getting your assets back plus fees. You can take those shares and show it to another smart contract and say, hey, smart contract, smart contract, I'm providing liquidity proof of liquidity. Here is my shares. And you can stake these shares just like proof of stake. And when you stake these shares, the other smart contract will reward you. And the idea is that protocols can pay you for providing liquidity, almost like market maker rebates in centralized exchanges by you staking your liquidity provider shares. And so that whole rigamar role was invented by synthetics.
00:20:59.274 - 00:21:46.526, Speaker B: And then a bunch of other protocols started trying to because synthetix very successfully was able to bootstrap a stablecoin that has no reason to actually stay at a dollar out of convincing enough people to join the system. And basically all the elements for the sushi swap drama have existed actually since march or April. It's just that people didn't kind of put the social puzzle together. And I think compound making liquidity mining and yield farming, a meme led to combine that with the fact that all the contracts exist led to sushi swap. One thing I just want to add is the synthetics contracts have gotten to the point where it's almost if you don't leave in the comments in the smart contract that's written by synthetics, everyone will think you made it up.
00:21:46.708 - 00:21:47.440, Speaker A: Why?
00:21:48.130 - 00:21:54.434, Speaker B: It's like a proof of authority, type of security. Like, oh, you wrote your own LP share staking thing.
00:21:54.632 - 00:22:10.774, Speaker A: Okay, so I think we've covered just the run up to sushi swap. So let's talk about how this project first appeared. So it wasn't the first food based project or food name project named after a food. There had been yams, was it?
00:22:10.812 - 00:22:12.774, Speaker C: I would say yam was the first.
00:22:12.972 - 00:22:15.046, Speaker A: The first food, first food group. Okay.
00:22:15.148 - 00:22:16.710, Speaker B: Bottom of the food pyramid.
00:22:17.290 - 00:22:28.300, Speaker C: Someone actually tweeted out that there are a bunch more food based companies that are extremely valuable, such as apple, and there were two more, but I forgot about them.
00:22:29.550 - 00:22:30.830, Speaker A: Burger king.
00:22:31.490 - 00:22:34.830, Speaker B: I don't know if dairy queen's particularly valuable.
00:22:35.170 - 00:22:35.920, Speaker A: True.
00:22:36.530 - 00:22:41.694, Speaker C: The point to this was that they were specifically not food companies. I got it.
00:22:41.892 - 00:22:43.730, Speaker A: Like tech companies with food.
00:22:43.880 - 00:23:31.678, Speaker C: So naming apparently projects after food has a rich history with some very successful outliers. We could talk about yam for a second here. So the way I understand it's, basically a fork of ampleforth, which is basically a money coin with rebasing mechanism. So that means instead of the price going up and your account balance of that particular coin staying constant, they do the opposite. The price stays constant, but your account balance constantly fluctuates. And sane person could ask, why would you possibly want to do that? It has no benefit. But nobody in the world is used to this sort of user experience when dealing with money.
00:23:31.678 - 00:23:52.274, Speaker C: And the response would be, yeah, it makes zero sense. The point is to deliberately confuse basically investors. You could say there's not really any point to it. So yem did this and a bunch of other things, and they utilized the synthetics staking contract. At least I think it was synthetics.
00:23:52.402 - 00:24:02.410, Speaker B: They copied pasta, comp governance, ampleforth and synthetics. Sorry, I love the phrase copy pasta because I just mean copy pasting contract.
00:24:02.910 - 00:24:33.582, Speaker C: Totally. Yeah. So those are actually the recipes. So you had ampleforth, you had synthetic staking, and you had comp governance. So this was the idea of having a kind of coin that has these attractive to some parts of the market like elements of a Ponzi scheme which is ampleforth. And you have this thing where the community owns all the coins. There's no pre mine and you can govern it yourself via governance and where you can farm it via the synthetics contract.
00:24:33.582 - 00:25:10.378, Speaker C: So it combined these three very in itself, very attractive and very successful components into something new. And I think the demand to farm this asset via these synthetic Staking contracts was insane. Right within the first 24 hours, over half a billion dollars went into these contracts that hadn't been audited. So it was basically brand new project that did not afford, because of the Fair launch, also did not afford to get an audit. And that's how it basically kicked off the hype around Yam.
00:25:10.554 - 00:25:30.834, Speaker A: But the hype around Yam didn't last particularly long. I remember it being about 24 hours before the sort of bug vulnerability was discovered and people, I guess, started to take all their money out if they could. What was the actual bug? What was the thing that broke Yam? And I know that the project is still alive, so maybe it's not actually broken. But what broke it then, at that launch?
00:25:30.882 - 00:26:09.234, Speaker C: I can take a shot at explaining it. I think the rebasing mechanism was broken. It minted too many new coins. And the problem was that some of these coins were actually minted in the Yem Treasury, which is like a place that governance can control. But the thing is, because so much of the supply was actually in the treasury, it couldn't vote for getting it out of the treasury. And that's how basically a lot of all the supply got kind of messed up and that's why they basically had to go back to the drawing board. So that's how I understand it.
00:26:09.432 - 00:26:31.100, Speaker A: But I do think of it as sort of a precursor to SushiSwap because it was this extremely exciting moment where this thing comes out and everybody jumps on it very quickly. And I think if we now turn to the SushiSwap launch and how that within, I don't know, two, three days generated such excitement, it has sort of a parallel, it seems.
00:26:31.550 - 00:27:21.020, Speaker C: One more thing that we should maybe mention is Yearn Finance and Wifey. So wifey is the governance token of Yarn finance. And it is, I would say, probably the blue chip kind of token blue chip project of this particular market cycle so far, in the sense that it's just a very good project and it has performed incredibly well since launch. And a lot of people have missed out on this because it went so far so quickly and there was just a lot of regret in the air. Like everyone you talked to was very regretful about kind of missing the run up on Wifey. So suddenly that increased the risk tolerance a lot, right? So there was a lot more to get in early, basically FOMO to get in early on any kind of new project.
00:27:21.470 - 00:27:45.246, Speaker A: Like how did SushiSwap actually start? I don't really remember the first time I saw it. Announcement on Twitter blog post. I guess there was someone named Chef Nomi who was the developer and as far as I know, like the sole developer behind this thing. Right. There was no team really. I know that there was somebody who joined for Community soon after, but the actual initial thing was just one developer.
00:27:45.438 - 00:28:37.522, Speaker B: I don't exactly know what the Chef Nomi timeline was, but more or less I was in a bunch of telegram groups and all of a sudden it's like everyone by the way, are you hungry for Japanese food? And I was like, what the fuck? And then I looked at the site and I'm like, this thing is a fucking joke. It's just like we have the finest omakase that you can make with your LP shares. Like the entire thing was like reading there's a menu. Yeah. One interesting aesthetic thing about yield farming is it brought out these 1980s video game vibes at first and then Yams changed that aesthetic to this. Like, how do you make a narrative around food? And then Sushi really took it one level further of like there was almost a plot. So it feels like you're in a video game.
00:28:37.576 - 00:28:37.938, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:38.024 - 00:28:53.394, Speaker B: And I think that's the thing that has really been the driver. A lot of this stuff feels like it's a video game. And the types of people who I are like I'm going to put tons of money in and not think about it are people who I kind of view as thinking of it as a game, less so as an investment.
00:28:53.442 - 00:29:26.770, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, if we compare this to something like another big project that has a lot of people's money in it, which is bitcoin is extremely user unfriendly and even hostile in many ways. But this is thought of by design because it shows you that you are responsible for your money and there are consequences to your actions. Whereas DeFi is taking like the new breed of kind of DeFi project is taking the exact opposite approach, which is kind of it is the gamification of basically financial applications.
00:29:27.270 - 00:29:37.080, Speaker A: There is a word for that by the way, casinos. It's not totally new that you make it shiny and flashy and fun.
00:29:39.690 - 00:30:01.710, Speaker C: Yeah, that is exactly what DeFi is doing. This stuff is just as risky or more risky as all of the other cryptocurrencies and projects that we had in the previous years where people lost funds sort of by user error or because something went wrong. But people feel a lot better about putting their money, the same money into stuff that looks very cute and gamified.
00:30:02.370 - 00:30:15.706, Speaker A: Totally. So yeah, the SushiSwap kind of let's define what SushiSwap was or is. Sorry, I shouldn't say that. It's still around. Let's define what SushiSwap is then. So SushiSwap is. A fork of uniswap.
00:30:15.706 - 00:30:18.542, Speaker A: Although, to start, was it actually a fork?
00:30:18.686 - 00:31:26.818, Speaker C: So yeah, that is actually something that I've seen a lot of people get wrong. So a lot of people started saying that SushiSwap is a fork of uniswap or it's an exchange, while it was really just the staking contract for uniswap LP tokens. And that's why so many people were confused. So why is uniswap's volume going up? Why is the total value locked in uniswap going up when there's this new competitor? How does this make sense? And the reason is that all of the money, quote unquote in SushiSwap was actually in uniswap because SushiSwap was just the place to stake your uniswap FP tokens. So uniswap actually saw a huge boost in capital and in trading volume from SushiSwap. That's what happened initially. And then the idea would be that there's a quote unquote migration where people agree that SushiSwap is allowed to go to uniswap with the staked uniswap LP shares, withdraw the money from uniswap, then put it into a forked version of SushiSwap, but that did not prior to this exist.
00:31:26.818 - 00:31:33.706, Speaker C: And that is the moment when actually the exchange SushiSwap would go I mean.
00:31:33.808 - 00:31:45.406, Speaker A: We kind of mentioned this, but when one would provide liquidity in uniswap, you don't receive governance tokens, but you do receive these LP tokens. What did you just call them?
00:31:45.428 - 00:31:49.498, Speaker C: Liquidity providers, LP tokens. And the LP stands for liquidity provider.
00:31:49.674 - 00:31:58.930, Speaker A: Yeah. So the liquidity provider tokens. And that is what you would actually take and then stake or put into the SushiSwap contract.
00:31:59.270 - 00:32:47.406, Speaker B: One maybe slight nuanced technical detail about the SushiSwap contract is that you had to authorize a transaction that allowed for this migration to work. And what that means migrate basically means imagine you put ETH and I don't know, what could you stake? I mean, there are tons of things. Imagine you put ethan and not maker ethan and synthetics into a uniswap pool. Share. SNX you generate some LP shares. Say you have ten shares, you stake it in Sushi swap, but you also sign a bunch of transactions that say, hey, when the SushiSwap admin key calls migrate. It takes my shares, destroys them, and then makes the exact same version in SushiSwap.
00:32:47.406 - 00:33:04.774, Speaker B: And you sign a transaction that allows that, which is a slight difference in normal staking where you just get paid. And it doesn't take mutation rights like mutability rights on your LP shares. So that mutation thing is quite different than the normal staking. That's where the vampiric part comes in. On a technical level, it's very good.
00:33:04.812 - 00:33:18.890, Speaker C: That you point that out because usually uniswap could not take the capital from your LP shares and migrate them somewhere else. Right. So that is something that you signed exclusively with SushiSwap.
00:33:19.630 - 00:33:22.318, Speaker B: It's a little bit like investing in an activist hedge fund.
00:33:22.404 - 00:33:24.158, Speaker C: Yeah, in a sense, yeah.
00:33:24.324 - 00:34:00.280, Speaker A: So once this liquidity provider, someone with LP tokens, had moved or put their LP tokens in the Sushi swap contract, they started to receive what did we call them? Sushis. Sushis. So the Sushi token, I say this like, it happened so long ago anyway, but we started to receive Sushis, or one would start to receive Sushi token. They could actually take that out at any point and sell it if they wanted to. A small marketplace, or actually, I guess a pretty substantial market bloomed out of that.
00:34:00.650 - 00:34:06.986, Speaker C: It was the most traded token, the highest trading volume token in DeFi for the initial like three to four days.
00:34:07.168 - 00:34:14.880, Speaker A: And at the time, I guess you have this brand new token that's kind of being dumped on the market, like, who's sitting there being like, give it to me at $10.
00:34:15.250 - 00:34:44.674, Speaker B: So there's a bit of a really amazing game that goes on in almost all of these things that's recursive, which is every one of these launches realized that once you're paying people for all this liquidity, they need somewhere to trade it. But there's nowhere to trade it. There's no, like, binance isn't going to list you. Coinbase isn't going to list you. What you do is you give people a bigger bonus for minting uniswap LP shares of that token to ETH or that token to USDC.
00:34:44.722 - 00:34:52.806, Speaker C: You're basically market making the token against other existing coins such as ETH or USDC.
00:34:52.998 - 00:34:58.314, Speaker A: And that's how they provided the liquidity for those people who are trying to sell it. Oh my god.
00:34:58.432 - 00:35:43.894, Speaker C: Yeah, but I mean, you have to go a step further and realize that we talked about impermanent loss right on uniswap. And when you provide a token like ETH or USDC and then provide Sushi against that, then Sushi is a token. We have no idea where it's supposed to trade. Right at any moment, it could go five X or it could lose 95% of its value. And when that happens, you actually stuck with basically the worthless token of the two. So you incur a lot of impermanent loss. So nobody would really market make these tokens, these super illiquid tokens, if they wouldn't get a large extra incentive in the form of even more Sushi swap tokens.
00:35:43.894 - 00:35:57.120, Speaker C: And that's why you would earn 100 Sushi tokens in a regular staking contract. And at the same time, you would earn 1000 Sushi tokens in the LP contract if you put it there.
00:35:57.650 - 00:36:06.094, Speaker A: If you had put your LP tokens over, were you still actually generating any of the liquidity provider fees from uniswap.
00:36:06.142 - 00:36:12.226, Speaker C: At the same time you were still a uniswap LP the entire time?
00:36:12.408 - 00:36:21.240, Speaker A: I don't know if you can tell, but I did actually experiment a little bit with this, but not clearly didn't fully understand everything that was happening. Also was not very much money.
00:36:21.770 - 00:37:05.054, Speaker B: So one of the great memes that the link marines have come up with for this idea that, hey, you're providing liquidity for this new token and ETH, and then all of a sudden the token price crashes and you hold a huge amount of losses is the rug pull getting the rug pulled under you? And there's so many ridiculous memes I've seen of Pepe the Frog having another Pepe the Frog pulling the rug under them. And it's like, I mean, the level of artistic creativity that's gone into these things might surpass anything I've ever seen in crypto. It's like, truly, the memes have made their own economy.
00:37:05.102 - 00:37:17.590, Speaker C: Yeah. And I mean, it goes back to this kind of gamification of any kind of financial application, right. Because it's not fun to incur, like, large amounts of impermanent loss to your LP shares.
00:37:18.090 - 00:37:21.078, Speaker B: But it's fun when you can tweet that I got rug pulled.
00:37:21.174 - 00:37:29.274, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So I generally think it makes you feel better about yourself when you have these kind of memes to fall back mean.
00:37:29.312 - 00:38:05.062, Speaker A: So there was this one kind of tweet or narrative that I remember about three, four days after this launched, which took it in sort of a different direction, which was this idea that Uniswap was a VC backed kind. Of, even though it's such a new project, it was like the man that the community needed to take down and that by using SushiSwap, you were making the community driven version and you were actually taking the funds away or taking the power away from the VCs. What did you think about that?
00:38:05.196 - 00:38:33.406, Speaker B: All I have to say is this is a nonsense assertion. Uniswap is the only public good that exists in Ethereum other than the chain itself. In some ways, the liquidity providers get all of the revenue. There's no company getting the revenue. Right. Uniswap, it just boggles my mind that you've convinced yourself that you need a community which ended up being an exchange owner and nine, eight other people as like the owner. Yes.
00:38:33.428 - 00:39:04.746, Speaker C: I mean, you can really like an image that I like to draw is imagine you live in a city and there's like a public park that everyone can use, okay? And then there comes a group of activists who basically take over the park, say, we are taking it away from the men, we are giving it to the people. But they create like fences all around it and they charge $5 entry. Because that is exactly what SushiSwap is. They take Uniswap, they make it worse, they charge money for it.
00:39:04.928 - 00:39:14.390, Speaker B: But the beauty of such vampiric capitalism is that there's always another Japanese food, aka sashimi swap, which eventually kind of.
00:39:14.400 - 00:39:16.298, Speaker C: Took a ton of liquidity sake swap.
00:39:16.394 - 00:39:17.514, Speaker B: And then sake swap.
00:39:17.562 - 00:39:20.958, Speaker C: Yeah, there were like a bunch more Kimchi swap, I think I saw.
00:39:21.044 - 00:39:26.754, Speaker B: But that one had a bug. Kimchi swap had a bug and people got very hard going.
00:39:26.792 - 00:40:36.310, Speaker C: Actually, back to the example with the park. So let's actually say there was someone who made fences all around the park and started charging entry. So it's not all stupid, right? Because privatization is actually a valid strategy, a valid solution to many strategic problems that exist in the real world. So because once you have someone making money from that park and people paying money to enter the park, you actually have someone who is in charge of the park, who is the sole owner of the park and who is incentivized to make the park. Better to guess, like, what might the people want to do in my park? What kind of food can I offer, what kind of drinks, what kind of activities? They make sure that the park is kept clean. Right? So that is really the idea behind adding ownership tokens or governance tokens to a project, because it basically attracts people who care about the project and who want to make it better. So that is what I would say is the bullcase for any kind of governance token in crypto.
00:40:36.650 - 00:41:19.622, Speaker A: So the migration originally was planned for two weeks after the project launched. I remember that. And then at some point, the migration date got moved up, and that was just around the time that the market took a little dive, not a huge one, but all crypto prices went down. And that day, Chef Nomi started to sell some tokens, some Sushi tokens for ETH that it seems like the community was not entirely aware he had access or he or she had access to, or full access to, because there was never really talk about this pool of tokens. Was everyone aware that there was like one key, basically one individual who owned who had access to this?
00:41:19.676 - 00:41:52.106, Speaker C: So I wasn't aware of it. I mean, I think in hindsight, it was added sometime later. I think actually some people on Twitter suggested that they create a developer fund where 10% of all Sushi is created, is actually siphoned off into this fund and put away for future development efforts such as security audits, but also contract work, design, marketing, that kind of stuff. That is basically the money, or part of that money that Chef Nomi then took and withdrew.
00:41:52.298 - 00:42:30.026, Speaker A: Yeah. So Chef Nomi started to sell off a lot of the Sushi that was in their possession, and it dumped the price even further. People noticed it was sort of two big sums that were dumped on the market and people started to get very angry. The reaction was odd. Chef Nomi, during this entire time was tweeting with people and saying like, oh, no, I don't want to worry about the price anymore, and I'm too conscious about the price, so I'm going to take my winnings and then I'm going to keep doing this thing. Don't worry about it. Any theories? We don't want to go conspiracy theory, I get it.
00:42:30.048 - 00:43:23.978, Speaker C: But to me, it seemed like we had a very inexperienced person on our hands who was suddenly in charge of a big project that maybe got a lot more attention than they thought. And they maybe had all these kind of ideas and dreams, what they would turn it into, what they would do with all the money that they earned. And then a few things happened, right? So I guess the biggest one is that the price started going from like $10, $11 to around $4. And well, they basically lost their nerves, I would guess. I mean, they saw it going to zero and saw basically the experiment failed and thought, before it goes to zero, first let me actually try to pull up the migration. And when that didn't work out, I think there was a bug found in the migration contract. So they said we have to fix that first, and they just cashed out and ran.
00:43:23.978 - 00:43:26.480, Speaker C: So that would be my interpretation of it.
00:43:27.010 - 00:44:03.526, Speaker B: Something very important to note is that there was a very aggressive listing of Sushi on FTX first, like within 24 hours, and then finance within another 24 hours. That doesn't happen very often, and I think that furthers a lot of the WTFing because finance used to charge people million dollars plus like blockstack, which is a little bit of a zombie project land. They had to pay a crazy amount to finance because they had to publicly declare it because they did a reggae.
00:44:03.558 - 00:44:03.706, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:03.728 - 00:44:19.166, Speaker B: They paid like $3 million. Right. And somehow now they're just like listing food coins without thinking something was very don't get me wrong, I think the exchanges are run by smart people and they were very opportunistic when they saw.
00:44:19.348 - 00:44:21.966, Speaker C: Mean and they didn't just list the.
00:44:21.988 - 00:44:24.494, Speaker B: Spot sushi the futures.
00:44:24.542 - 00:45:19.570, Speaker C: Yeah, they also created perpetual swaps for Sushi. For years, Ether didn't even have perpetual contracts on the largest exchange or so. And I mean, some of the coins actually in the top ten don't have perpetual swap contracts on these exchanges. And then you get a token like Sushi, which gets a perpetual swap contract on the first day. So you really have to go and think, so why did this happen? The idea was, or like what many people suspected, and there was actually a lot of evidence for this as well, is that elementa is basically, I don't know if FTX is like a subsidiary of them or whatever, but they are basically a market making firm, trading firm that have a lot of capital. And they were most of the liquidity in SushiSwap. So they basically went and put their power behind this project and their capital and they just farmed it.
00:45:19.570 - 00:45:43.340, Speaker C: Right, but when you farm a lot of a token that is very new and that doesn't have a lot of organic demand, then what happens if you try to sell even like 10% of your tokens? Then you would just crash the market to zero, basically. So they knew that they couldn't sell their stake at least immediately, so they would have to sell it.
00:45:43.710 - 00:46:11.730, Speaker B: Well, they were selling it and the price dumped to $0.50. Right, from like $5. And then remember on day one, there was like $60 million from like three addresses that in Nanson, for instance, you can see are tagged as Alameda, which is a lot of money for unauthorized smart contract. And now no one seems to blink an eye at doing that. But there was a lot of money in there and they were farming like 80% plus 80%.
00:46:11.800 - 00:46:15.026, Speaker C: Wow, okay. That's even more than I thought in.
00:46:15.048 - 00:46:47.694, Speaker B: The first 24 hours before, all of the kind of dumb fund managers just were like, oh, Alameda is doing it, we'll do it too. Which is like I think my messages were filled with people like, hey, what's the Sushi thing? I heard that Alameda is going in it. Should we just go in in size? And I like, what? Yeah, but in the beginning, they were farming, like, most of it, but the problem is they started selling in it. The thing is, you're incentivizing people to take this impermanent loss by having them stake their LP share to make sure there's a market for it, but they were really crashing it and then the future comes out.
00:46:47.892 - 00:47:10.214, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. That's what I was going to say. So you really can't exit that position in a normal way. But what you can do if you're an exchange and I mean, I think FTX is partially owned by Binance. Yeah, or fully no. So they actually have like a hot wire to Binance as well. Right.
00:47:10.214 - 00:47:39.920, Speaker C: So what Binance and FTX both did was list the token and all this. You can assume that all of the sales side of the order book was probably FTX or Elementor selling their own tokens. The entire sales side of the futures order book was Elementa hedging their long position in Sushi. So they really did this as a way to offload their Sushi tokens to their customers? Yes. It is crazy.
00:47:40.290 - 00:48:11.034, Speaker B: There's a reason there's a lot of regulation that exists in non crypto land of like, exchange owners shouldn't be prop trading on their own. Exchange, which happened in the early electronic markets. Dats, which is the third largest US. Exchange, was made by high frequency traders as a way to compete with Nasdaq and Nizi. And FTX is know, don't get me wrong, FTX technologically is by far the best exchange. Like, the other exchanges are boomer finance. But FTX is probably, I would say, of the caliber to know what they're doing.
00:48:11.034 - 00:48:47.090, Speaker B: And they also saw this opportunity to take away liquidity from uniswap, which had been starting to eat away at a lot of exchanges. Right. Like, the thesis is the following. There's the big cap crypto, so ETH BTC going to be dominated by Binance, coinbase, Kraken, whatever. There's the mid cap of like 100 million, market cap to a billion. That's going to be dominated by the FTX of the world, people who provide really good technology for trading shitcoins. It's not going to be provided by someone with a terrible API that doesn't respond correctly, like Binance.
00:48:47.090 - 00:49:36.946, Speaker B: And then there's the really low cap, the long tail, as unisop users would call it, of assets. That who knows if people want to buy my Supreme Sneaker NFT Tokenized, but I can make a uniswap market because it doesn't really cost anything and people can go buy it. And this fat tail thing, this food coin and precursor to Sushi swap, made the long tail seep into the mid cap where you can have a yam coin that reaches 100 to 500 million dollar market cap range. And all of that liquidity and all of that trading is not at finance, it's not at FTX, it's not at Coinbase. It's all on uniswap. That's scary decentralized exchanges. So they're very much incentivized and they're also not idealistic in the way that I think a lot of the developer side is.
00:49:36.946 - 00:49:45.126, Speaker B: And they think about adverse selection, they're much more incentivized to try to do these vampire attacks, especially as the market caps go up and the volume goes up.
00:49:45.148 - 00:50:05.822, Speaker C: Yeah. So something maybe to mention is that in the weeks before SushiSwap, uniswap actually had some of the highest trading volume in all of crypto. So they actually had higher trading volume than Coinbase. Not just Coinbase pro. Also like Coinbase and Coinbase retail combined. So they actually had insane trading volume. Right.
00:50:05.822 - 00:50:36.920, Speaker C: I think that many centralized exchanges were generally like shit scared about them and still are. Can we can speculate? Of course, but from the vantage point of being a centralized exchange, it would make a ton of sense to fork Uniswap and try to drain their liquidity, but in a way that you at least either fully or partially own the exchange yourself, right, and can actually get these profits for yourself.
00:50:37.370 - 00:50:51.434, Speaker A: So let's talk a little bit about the aftermath of like I think we're still at the point of the exit scam right now and people are freaking out after Chef Nomi has left. Right? We haven't actually done the migration yet, like just in terms of our narrative.
00:50:51.482 - 00:50:52.320, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah.
00:50:52.690 - 00:50:57.434, Speaker B: In case you're wondering, Anna's going to make a movie about kidding.
00:50:57.482 - 00:50:58.640, Speaker A: Who will play the.
00:51:00.530 - 00:51:04.486, Speaker B: Would she's like the narrator in the movie?
00:51:04.538 - 00:51:06.100, Speaker C: I'd watch it. Sure.
00:51:07.030 - 00:51:25.266, Speaker A: Okay, so this aftermath but actually, maybe even before we do that, there was one other point that was often mentioned, which was not only what you're talking about the threat to the centralized exchange, but it was also this idea of potentially solana or like what is it? Serum, which lives on a different blockchain.
00:51:25.378 - 00:51:47.354, Speaker C: Is another layer, one blockchain. They'll hate me for this, but in terms of their design philosophy, you can kind of compare them a bit, like to EOS in the sense that they have a few validators and they run extremely powerful expensive machines. So they are basically very high throughput low latency blockchain.
00:51:47.482 - 00:52:05.262, Speaker A: And they had on top of them serum built like there's a DAP or something that lives on their blockchain. And there was some talk and I guess that never happened, but there was some talk of migrating Sushi and this, I didn't actually understand how this would work, but when the migration would happen, they would actually happen on this serum.
00:52:05.326 - 00:52:11.830, Speaker C: It would basically fork it and create basically a fork of SushiSwap on serum.
00:52:12.330 - 00:52:14.950, Speaker A: How would it then interact back with ethereum?
00:52:15.850 - 00:53:06.326, Speaker B: This is an interesting thing that covers many of your prior guests on this show, Anna, which is that know, I think when Sam's founder FTX first mentioned it to me, I was like, oh, so how are you going to do the cross chain stuff? And he's, you know, Solana is going to figure it out. And Solana was like, well, Prestwich is going to figure it out. And so theoretically, and I don't know exactly how this is going to unfold, but theoretically there's supposed to be a safe cross chain bridge, kind of like things you've talked about many times on the ZK podcast, which is a very hard thing to build, extremely hard. And lots of people have made really crappy ones that have been exploited and people lose funds. And serum is supposed to actually be cross chain to Bitcoin and ETH theoretically. And so the idea know, SushiSwap could basically take advantage of that.
00:53:06.348 - 00:53:09.874, Speaker A: But then is it built out of smart contracts that live on Solana?
00:53:10.002 - 00:53:15.702, Speaker B: It's built off smart contracts that live off both Solana and like there's, there's a relay contract.
00:53:15.766 - 00:53:16.106, Speaker A: Got it.
00:53:16.128 - 00:54:08.822, Speaker B: So the relay contract is like something that relays the state between the two. And the problem with this type of stuff is that a, a lot of the fancy cryptography people use on the new chains is extremely slow or incredibly gas expensive on ETH. So you can actually see there's a bunch of EIPS that people have proposed for pre compiles of like BLS and other cryptographic primitives so that these relays can be faster. Otherwise they're really expensive. And the way they get over the expensive thing is by lowering the trust model of having a relayer. And you trust that there's enough relayers that I won't lie about the state transition, which whatever, but that's what people are doing. So my point is FTX hasn't solved this problem, solana hasn't solved this problem, and a lot of the scalability solutions really rely on good relayers.
00:54:08.822 - 00:54:14.122, Speaker B: And as we all know, our friend Preswich is the expert in all of this.
00:54:14.256 - 00:54:22.750, Speaker A: I don't know if I just missed it, but did you mention what the relationship between FTX and serum actually is? Because I don't understand you speak about them in tandem.
00:54:23.330 - 00:55:18.066, Speaker B: I'll give a little background because I've known Sam for a while and I know a little bit of the backstory behind this, which is so Sam in May was really interested in DeFi and he was like, this is actually going to potentially eat our lunch because okay, Sam is like order of magnitude smarter than all the other exchange owners. So remember this. He's like a math person. Sam was the first exchange operator to view liquidity mining, the synthetic style thing, as a threat and realize that, hey, this could actually take away a lot of volume from my exchange. And he was the first one to really spend a lot of time reading code, reading the papers, because he's a very technical person compared to other folks. And he basically, in May was like, shit, we need to build a Dex. We need to actually be on top of this.
00:55:18.066 - 00:55:55.834, Speaker B: Because Binance Dex is a joke. They run all the nodes. Pobi's whole thing is like it's kind of complicated and involves Nervos. And Chinese government is slow. I don't know. There's like a lot of complication with the other exchanges because they're in China, right? So they can't quite do the Dex thing as well. But FTX was in a good position and they were like, okay, what should we use? And because they're HFT people, they were like, okay, what's the lowest latency layer, one blockchain we can find? And that's Solana, because Solana is written with latency in mind, right? Because it's a bunch of telecom engineers.
00:55:55.834 - 00:56:17.454, Speaker B: I kind of told you. And basically he was like, I got to do this now. And so he set up the whole thing. He was like, okay, here's how we're going to do it. We're going to do on Solana, someone's going to build a bridge to ETH and Bitcoin, and then we're going to have a Dex. There's going to be all the Solana validators are going to earn some rewards. And he set it up within a month, like, I think in June.
00:56:17.454 - 00:56:53.306, Speaker B: Was the announcement something like, you know, I think for better or worse, he's the only exchange operator who realized that this was going to come. And he announced everything at the right time. He also owns a prop trading firm that was farming in June like they were the biggest comp farmers, for instance, for a while. And it's very clear that the personalities involved, there's a huge lead up to the Sushi thing. And I think he knows an opportunity when he sees it versus some of the other exchange operators. Just like, we're way too late to the game to realize that it's possible for DEXes to eat their lunch.
00:56:53.418 - 00:57:28.442, Speaker C: Yeah, that's such a great explanation. And I think what most people don't appreciate about Sushi is they just look at these events and maybe see them as some standalone thing. But with every great event that kind of happens, it's almost like you only see the very tip of the iceberg when you look at the event itself and don't look at everything. All the parties involved, their motivations, and maybe how two of them felt a corner, two of them felt like they had to make a move now. And that's always what leads to an eruption like this. And so someone like Chef nomi. Right.
00:57:28.442 - 00:57:42.510, Speaker C: He's someone the media ledges on to, like, the crypto media. But he's a pawn. Like, he's a tiny pawn in this story. He's irrelevant. Like, completely irrelevant. The money he took is irrelevant. He, as a person is irrelevant.
00:57:42.510 - 00:57:53.506, Speaker C: There are, like, whales basically fighting against each other, like large exchanges. Extremely intelligent, well capitalized people are dueling it out.
00:57:53.688 - 00:58:20.730, Speaker B: We should say extremely intelligent, well capitalized versus follower people. So another dynamic that's very important is that people kind of are like, oh, Alameda's doing it. I'm going to do it too. And there's kind of this dumb follower mentality, which is what made Sushi's volume grow so high, is that like, oh, they're doing it. Like, oh, we got to go in too. There's this herd mentality that's also quite an important dynamic in the Incentives.
00:58:21.150 - 00:58:39.340, Speaker A: Okay, so I think we're going to stop the episode on the ZK podcast here, but this episode is not finished, so please head over to Uncommon Core. I'm going to add the link in the show notes, and there you can actually hear part two or actually the rest of this interview. So see you there.
