00:00:05.770 - 00:00:41.802, Speaker A: Welcome to zero knowledge. I'm your host, Anna Rose. In this podcast, we will be exploring the latest in zero knowledge research and the decentralized web, as well as new paradigms that promise to change the way we interact and transact online. You. So welcome back. As some of you may have noticed, there was no episode last week. This is the first episode of 2021, and actually that week off was the first break I took since this podcast started three years ago.
00:00:41.802 - 00:01:28.440, Speaker A: And it was pretty good, to be honest. Now, you may have also noticed that the intro is a little bit different, and for anyone who missed the end of year podcast that we released two weeks ago, there's been a pretty big change here at the Zero Knowledge podcast. So Frederick, my long standing co host and the other voice you are very used to hearing on the show, will sadly no longer be joining me on the show every week. In the end of your episode, frederick actually shared why he felt he wanted to leave the show. And so if you want to hear more about that in his own words, you should listen to that episode. I'll add the link in the show notes or you can just look at the episode that came before this one. It's been a great run and I am super proud of the work we did and it's sad to see him go.
00:01:28.440 - 00:02:14.834, Speaker A: But like all change, this also offers up an opportunity to rethink the podcast and maybe take it in a new direction. So during my time off, I was able to spend time reading and learning about new ideas and get inspired, and I feel I've come back more inspired for sure than I felt at the end of 2020. So I think this coming year should actually be an exceptional one. And it's clear that the work we are doing in the field of zero knowledge and decentralized tech is more relevant and valuable than ever. Enjoy this first episode of the year. My guests are Tarun Sheetra, james Prestwich and Josh Cincinnati. We chat about where we are at in the field of zero knowledge.
00:02:14.834 - 00:02:46.254, Speaker A: Applications blockchain privacy and DeFi, and we also try to imagine where this could be going in the near future. So hope you enjoy it. If you haven't yet, please do subscribe. Maybe tell a friend who you think might get something out of this. Yeah. So here's my conversation with Tarun, James and Josh. So today I will be doing a catch up with some friends you may be familiar with if you are a regular listener to this show.
00:02:46.254 - 00:02:59.830, Speaker A: Tarun, James and Josh are here to kick off the new year and set 2021 on its course. So you have all been on, but let's do a quick round of intros so that people know who's talking and what you're all about.
00:02:59.980 - 00:03:14.822, Speaker B: Sure. It's nice to be back on the podcast. My name is James Prestwich. I'm currently a protocol engineer at Celo. We work on the Celo blockchain, which is a proof of stake chain with EVM.
00:03:14.966 - 00:03:42.738, Speaker C: So I'm Josh Cincinnati. I was previously the executive director of the Zcash Foundation, and prior to that, I was the developer advocate at BlockCypher a Bitcoin and Ethereum API Company. And now I am what I like to call Gainfully unemployed. And I'm just doing a bit of advising and some fun stuff on the side and have just had my ear to the ground with all things cryptocurrency for quite a while.
00:03:42.904 - 00:03:49.198, Speaker A: Also, the co host of the acclaimed twadcast Josh's Dumb Voice is what it is.
00:03:49.224 - 00:03:59.910, Speaker C: Perhaps the only one of its kind. I don't know that there are other is. You know, this is new for me because I'm used to the two minute format constraint, but I'll do my best.
00:03:59.980 - 00:04:08.922, Speaker A: Hopefully there'll be some bangers. Okay, now, Tarun, you have already guest hosted quite often, so people should be pretty familiar with you, but maybe you want to just say a little hello.
00:04:09.056 - 00:04:09.450, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:09.520 - 00:04:09.802, Speaker B: Hey.
00:04:09.856 - 00:04:27.410, Speaker D: I'm Tarun. I am founder of a company called Gauntlet. We kind of assess economic attacks and economic security in proof stake protocols and also in DeFi protocols. And I also do a little investing on the side with robot ventures.
00:04:27.750 - 00:04:46.600, Speaker A: Nice. So it's funny, I think Tarun, James, Frederick and I did do one of these kind of more catch up y episodes. Do you remember? This was like, Stanford stanford Blockchain conference right before it all went down, man.
00:04:47.050 - 00:04:56.540, Speaker D: But do you guys remember how amazing it was that everyone for who was there from Asia was just like, WTF, Americans, what are you doing? And everyone at the comfort is.
00:04:58.270 - 00:04:59.318, Speaker B: Yep.
00:04:59.494 - 00:05:13.998, Speaker A: Man, I was just thinking about that, though. That was sort of the last time I did an episode like this, which was more just kind of casual and catching up with folks and I think what were we talking about back then? It was the flash loans or something. Yes.
00:05:14.084 - 00:05:16.980, Speaker C: Oh, my gosh. Remember flash loans? I do.
00:05:17.510 - 00:05:18.914, Speaker A: Well, I feel like they're still kind of happening.
00:05:18.952 - 00:05:20.850, Speaker B: They do happen. Yeah, they're huge.
00:05:20.920 - 00:05:23.730, Speaker D: Yeah. They're like a regular part of the ecosystem now.
00:05:23.800 - 00:05:25.038, Speaker B: They've just become normal.
00:05:25.134 - 00:05:26.946, Speaker D: They sometimes are used in attacks.
00:05:27.058 - 00:05:41.260, Speaker B: We've seen flash loans really catch on. They're pretty much standard attack vectors now, but we haven't seen flash minting yet. There's a proposal to put it in WETH version ten, but we'll see if that happens.
00:05:41.790 - 00:05:44.570, Speaker A: What would that mean? What's flash minting?
00:05:44.910 - 00:05:52.558, Speaker B: It means that you can not just borrow tokens that exist, but create tokens that don't exist as long as you burn them again before the end of.
00:05:52.564 - 00:05:59.326, Speaker A: The transaction, but of a certain type of like an existing token, as long.
00:05:59.348 - 00:06:11.266, Speaker B: As the token contract supports it. So the idea of putting flash minting in WETH is that you could have an infinite amount, for all intents and purposes, of WETH for one transaction is.
00:06:11.288 - 00:06:21.154, Speaker D: That a good also maker actually tried to add this and really for MKR and it did not succeed.
00:06:21.282 - 00:06:22.102, Speaker B: I missed that.
00:06:22.156 - 00:06:25.554, Speaker A: Wait, it did not succeed in being implemented because of the governance.
00:06:25.602 - 00:06:27.314, Speaker D: It did not succeed in passing governance.
00:06:27.362 - 00:06:30.874, Speaker A: Okay. It's not that it failed on the no, no.
00:06:30.912 - 00:06:33.146, Speaker D: The code is out there. Code is out there.
00:06:33.168 - 00:06:41.280, Speaker C: It's in their should if only they could have minted an infinite number of governance tokens there you go.
00:06:42.610 - 00:06:45.550, Speaker A: For that one transaction of voting.
00:06:47.090 - 00:07:29.706, Speaker D: Well, that actually also happened, by the way. MKR has just maybe a slight aside, has a continuous voting mechanism. So like, imagine if you put up a proposal that says, hey, make Anna like Queen of Berlin who says I'm not already? And basically people vote on that. And anytime the percentage of the vote flips from below 50 to above 50, then the answer let's say it's like 52% no initially and then it flips to like 45% no. Then all of a sudden you will be anointed queen. But if people remove their votes to that proposal and it falls back down, you lose your queen test. So it's kind of continuous voting in.
00:07:29.728 - 00:07:34.090, Speaker A: Order so that a flash wouldn't work. Like you'd have to keep it up somehow.
00:07:34.250 - 00:07:42.202, Speaker D: Although yeah, although there was a bug that actually someone found a way to do some a flash thing that sustained at the very last minute.
00:07:42.266 - 00:07:42.686, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:42.788 - 00:07:45.006, Speaker D: Yeah. Basically they like front run someone and.
00:07:45.028 - 00:07:54.898, Speaker A: Did a flash oh, at the very last minute to get the vote in. Because then even though it's been going over, it's not like an average of that time. It's just like whatever, it ends up on. Oh, wow.
00:07:54.984 - 00:08:01.014, Speaker D: Yeah. So they changed that to have but anyway sorry, maybe that oh, this is.
00:08:01.052 - 00:08:47.190, Speaker A: Actually exactly the kind of stuff I want to talk about today. There is a little bit of a schedule that I put together of kind of a few topics that we can talk about. But this is kind of the purpose of this episode. It's a bit of a checking in where we're at, maybe talking about some of the things we expect to see. I don't want to do a big prediction for the year, but maybe like this quarter and get some general thoughts about what's up. And also given that it's a zero knowledge podcast, given that there's this changed format, one of my goals is also to start talking about potential topics or ideas that are exciting things that we could even cover in future episodes in depth. So first is a quick rundown of where we are at.
00:08:47.190 - 00:08:55.398, Speaker A: We are currently recording on what is it, january 9? What is going on right now?
00:08:55.564 - 00:09:31.070, Speaker C: It's pretty boring. Not much. Nowhere. Nothing interesting. Well, I mean, I guess other than the botched coup in America and crypto assets exceeding a trillion dollars, but that's yeah, it is sort of nuts though. I mean, it seems like we seem to be at the beginning of, at least from a pure interest and speculation perspective, it seems like we're in the beginning of another 2017 style run, which may be good or bad, depending on your perspective.
00:09:31.150 - 00:09:57.610, Speaker B: You just said beginning of really when Bitcoin in 2016. 2017 eclipsed its previous all time high. It went on to just about ten X after that. So if it follows a similar pattern, there's still a ten X in the future. That seems pretty crazy to me. I don't think that's actually likely to happen.
00:09:57.760 - 00:10:09.230, Speaker C: Yeah, I would agree. And I guess by beginning of Bull Run, I don't know that it's going to match that same cycle. I mean, I don't know anything about price, to be honest.
00:10:09.300 - 00:10:09.582, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:09.636 - 00:11:00.686, Speaker C: I'm just purely based off of the kind of sentiment and interest that you see from people in and outside of our little niche industry. And in that regard, it does feel like we're still somewhat early in this stage and I don't know if that means and I agree with James, I think it's very unlikely that Bitcoin is going to breach that insane amount of money this time around. My big interest and focus, I think, for the next quarter is going to be really about what the and this is, again, obviously, like a US bias from my perspective. But seeing that new proposed rule by FinCEN and the incoming administration and how they might know cryptocurrency regulation differently is going to be something to watch very closely for the next couple of months.
00:11:00.788 - 00:11:31.270, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah, that's something. So far that I haven't covered much on the podcast, but I'm curious about that a little bit myself. I want to understand a bit more where things are at because I think the last time I really did any in depth look at that was in 2018 or something. It was quite a while ago, we've just been sort of rolling along, kind of under the radar and now all of a sudden I like that. Yeah, me too. I think there is this feeling I was talking to someone.
00:11:31.270 - 00:11:54.740, Speaker A: I was talking to you, Tarim, the other day and it was like the bear market was kind of nice. It was like this little crew and we'd see each other at conferences and there was nobody. We didn't have the random acquaintance pinging us about. What do you think about should I buy some bitcoin now or should I? Like, that's a tricky question. Whenever I get it, I'm just like I'm always like, no, too high.
00:11:55.350 - 00:12:00.770, Speaker B: You know how to stop those, right? What, don't have any friends outside of crypto?
00:12:01.430 - 00:12:03.620, Speaker A: That's my approach. God.
00:12:06.090 - 00:12:26.282, Speaker D: The best part is the relative ones, which are like, hey, can we talk? And you tell me how I should invest my crypto asset portfolio. I'm like, no, or I tell them random shitcoins that are guaranteed to go down.
00:12:26.336 - 00:12:26.650, Speaker A: No.
00:12:26.720 - 00:12:28.860, Speaker D: I'm like, these are definitely going to go down.
00:12:31.490 - 00:12:33.998, Speaker B: But most of those are going to go up first.
00:12:34.164 - 00:12:40.446, Speaker D: Yes, but don't tell people about reality. Tell people about the dream other than.
00:12:40.628 - 00:13:25.774, Speaker A: So I think to define this moment is a little bit like we're in a moment. There's a change this month than it was three months ago. Even with the DFI kind of excitement, this is definitely like, in a different space, I think. Another interesting thing that's happening right now, though, is there's a lot of projects that I've mentioned this a few times on the podcast, but a lot of the projects that raised in 2017 came out in the last quarter in Q Four, and now going into Q one of 2021, you have, like because some of them launched, but they didn't fully launch. Like polka Dot launched, but it didn't launch. Parachains and Cosmos launched. Actually, it launched a little bit before, but IBC hasn't launched fully yet.
00:13:25.774 - 00:13:39.806, Speaker A: So this is where I'm very curious. Are there any things that you know are going to actually happen this quarter that are something for us to pay attention to in blockchain and crypto and zero knowledge?
00:13:39.918 - 00:14:48.938, Speaker C: Something that I think will be interesting to look at. And full disclosure, I advise these folks a little bit, but I think that it's very likely that the Mina main net is going to launch. And that I think will be a very interesting test of well, it's going to be an interesting test for a number of reasons, but the biggest one, I think, is really like the approach of using their approach to recursive zero knowledge proofs to enable a more scalable blockchain of sorts. And I think that kind of is going to echo throughout a lot of different projects. Whether you're talking about like Rolex's L2 or the stuff that's happening with Halo on the Zcash side, you're going to see more people approaching it. It's cool to see, but there's also like, these I don't think it's it's the case that a lot of, like, the L2 approaches are premature optimization, right? Like, it's clear that that's sort of desperately needed on various places. But there is a question of like, whether these sort of base layer, scalability things for base layers that don't have as much usage or are brand new, whether that is a premature optimization to start.
00:14:49.104 - 00:14:52.742, Speaker A: What about you, Tarun? What's on your horizon for the quarter?
00:14:52.886 - 00:16:02.446, Speaker D: The interesting thing that I've been thinking about at least, and this goes to Josh's point regarding privacy, we saw all this growth in spite of the fact that we have piss poor privacy right now, which is what is the ImageNet moment for crypto. So if we look back like ten years ago, the thing that caused kind of the boom in AI stuff and facial recognition and eventually the surveillance capitalism stuff in general was ImageNet, which is like 2010 actually, when people realized that you could throw more hardware at neural nets and actually classify people's cat versus their dog poop. And so basically, ImageNet set off this huge kind of boom. And that boom came from the fact that people actually saw how this could be useful in practice. And it set off this thing about making good developer tools, making good UX, hiding things. It's shitty for privacy, but good UX is like Alexa. Anyone can use Alexa and they have to think about it.
00:16:02.446 - 00:16:28.070, Speaker D: But it's actually doing all this stuff behind the scenes. So I kind of feel like the ImageNet moment has got to be some combination of privacy plus I'll call it DeFi in the sense of it needs to have more operations than just transfer. It needs to have some notion of trading, and he says, some notion of borrowing. Hopefully, this boom will actually push us across the finish line on that and we'll have that moment.
00:16:28.220 - 00:16:37.594, Speaker A: Do you think are there any projects that you've noticed kind of happening right now that are doing that, or is this something that you foresee for the year? Like a goal almost?
00:16:37.712 - 00:17:33.130, Speaker D: I think I've noticed a lot of zero knowledge researchers start looking into actual DeFi applications that are private, which I think is to me, that's like the Holy Grail. Barry has been on a bunch of forums writing about how do I make some approximation to a zero knowledge version of Uniswap? There are a lot of reasons you can't directly, but I've just noticed there's the ZK folks who we had the last wave, funded a lot of the ZK innovation, and we're kind of getting to some of that in production. And James can, of course, talk about some of that stuff, actually. But I have noticed a bunch of people starting to look more into DeFi, and I think that is the moment. We kind of have this switch that really makes it useful. I don't have a particular project. It's some combination of aleo, Aztec, maybe.
00:17:33.130 - 00:17:36.814, Speaker D: Starkware. I don't know. Starkware is doing things. It's, like, really hard to say.
00:17:36.852 - 00:17:56.478, Speaker A: Do you think Barry's post, in a way, was seen as a challenge to some of the ZK folks? Because it was pretty much saying, you can't do it, right? Like it's DeFi and privacy don't mesh in a way, at least in this particular example. And I know of at least two projects that are trying to do something in that direction using zero knowledge proofs and privacy.
00:17:56.654 - 00:18:22.634, Speaker D: I think it just says you can't do something as simple. Yeah, it doesn't say you can't do it at all. It just says that something that is really gas efficient, which is the real reason uniswap is good. It's just, like, simple compared to a real exchange is hard. But I don't think there's, like, an impossibility theorem. But to me, I think that's the thing. I think there's an image that Moment for.
00:18:22.634 - 00:18:38.450, Speaker D: And so I don't have any particular projects. I can tell you all the DeFi projects because I think they're doing a ton of new stuff, but they're not going to be the thing I think that actually crosses the chasm. I think you actually do need private versions of these for it to be useful.
00:18:39.670 - 00:19:20.842, Speaker B: To kind of trune's point, there's no impossibility theorem for all of this stuff, but we can make it for a bunch of specific applications. Like if you're trying to trade, you can't keep the current market price private because no one will trade if they don't know what the market price is. There have to be some kind of bounds on that. There has to be some way you can query and know what trade you're going to be making before dispatching your trade. So there's a lot of these additional constraints on any DeFi application with privacy. There's a bunch of things you can't do and a bunch of things that get much harder, but there's no reason to believe that it's all impossible.
00:19:20.986 - 00:20:16.180, Speaker C: I was just wondering because I think there is this motivation. There's clearly a motivated interest, I think, from people like us that see a need for that kind of privacy embedded in DeFi applications. I don't know that if it's just a bunch of very nerdy people who want it. The main example I have here, from my own experience, is just how hard it was to get people to use these super efficient Zcash privacy features. There wasn't as much priority in the Zcash ecosystem to push people to shielded adoption as I think that there should have been. There are other things at play there, but I could imagine something similar happening when you have like uniswap that's super gas efficient and then you might have some other cool deck. Private one manages to yeah, private one, but it's like, oh, it's going to cost ten X gas to do it.
00:20:16.180 - 00:20:50.666, Speaker C: Does it matter to me? I can see very large, very on chain hedge fund types wanting that privacy, but I don't know that it's going to trickle down to average users if it winds up costing more. But anyway, all of which to say, I'm just sort of curious. Do you think that there will be a push from protocol developers to figure out ways to encourage that to be the default? Is there going to be like a UX narrative push to try and get people behind it or something else or.
00:20:50.688 - 00:20:56.062, Speaker A: Maybe something from the actual from the business side that actually forces it?
00:20:56.196 - 00:21:46.062, Speaker B: I think it's a really interesting question because one of the outcomes we've seen from all of this DeFi summer and yield farming craze is that the blockchain itself does not really trickle down to the average user with even a moderate amount of usage. Like we're seeing the gas prices are too high for normal people to take advantage of all of this yield farming and the returns. And this fact is what kind of drove the development of YFI and harvest and all of these kind of vault things that batch hundreds or thousands of users into single fee payments, but you can't do that effectively with privacy. There's no good design for a private WiFi vault yet.
00:21:46.196 - 00:21:50.782, Speaker A: And is there a demand for it? It's kind of the question if people.
00:21:50.836 - 00:21:57.342, Speaker B: Can make money using it. One of the huge drivers for privacy in traditional markets is making money unsurprisingly.
00:21:57.486 - 00:23:07.830, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. I think that when you're saying kind of like from the business side, I think these protocols need to somehow have a much more concrete incentive to people producing privacy and spending resources on generating proofs or generating contributing hardware to doing that. And I think right now, if you look at most designs in privacy preserving networks, there's not really something that truly, actually rewards the people who actually have to spend extra resources. And so, in some sense, if you actually were able to somehow implicitly or explicitly tax the whales to pay for privacy for the naves and then somehow promise the whales future inflation or something look, I'm not saying I have an answer, but there has to be some way of forcing kind of like, hey, look, you whales. You can collect inflation, but you can only collect it if you somehow are, to use James's favorite phrase, if you're somehow providing privacy for the rubes.
00:23:09.930 - 00:23:11.618, Speaker A: When have you said James?
00:23:11.714 - 00:23:15.610, Speaker B: Oh, I've been using the word rubes a lot lately.
00:23:16.670 - 00:23:19.020, Speaker A: What is a rube? I don't know this word.
00:23:19.710 - 00:23:45.090, Speaker B: This is used to mean redneck down where I come from in the south, okay? But these days it means like the target of a scam, some naive person that you're going to go take money from. And just like in 2017, I think a huge amount of the market this cycle is driven by taking money from rubes.
00:23:46.870 - 00:23:56.920, Speaker A: A word that I want to bring back, and I actually have been using it all week, is calling someone a yahoo. I don't know if you know, it used to mean something other than a search engine.
00:23:57.690 - 00:23:59.206, Speaker C: Yeah, actually, I don't know what was.
00:23:59.228 - 00:24:35.374, Speaker A: The meaning of rude or something. It's an obnoxious person. It's a group of yahoos. I feel like old men used that term in the 80s or something, but then they turned it into a search engine and we lost it to the world. Another thing that is and I'm curious, one of you might know a bit more about what's going on with that, but last year, Libra was like, on the radar of everyone. Like, it's going to happen. Oh, no, libra now diem.
00:24:35.374 - 00:24:36.766, Speaker A: Okay, so Libra is no longer libra.
00:24:36.798 - 00:24:37.814, Speaker C: Is no longer our best friend.
00:24:37.852 - 00:24:45.480, Speaker A: Libra is deem. What's up with the project? Is it happening this year? Does anyone know?
00:24:46.570 - 00:24:47.542, Speaker D: Probably not.
00:24:47.676 - 00:24:48.710, Speaker C: Probably not.
00:24:48.860 - 00:24:50.034, Speaker B: Seems unlikely.
00:24:50.162 - 00:24:56.474, Speaker D: Yeah, I would say the Attrition personnel wise seems to be high. That would be the main thing I would point out.
00:24:56.512 - 00:25:10.474, Speaker A: All right. There was also a project that it was actually one of the first projects that I ever, I think that we ever did a deep technical dive on. And that was DEFINITY three years ago. What's going on with Launch?
00:25:10.522 - 00:25:11.822, Speaker D: They launched this week.
00:25:11.956 - 00:25:12.640, Speaker A: Really?
00:25:14.870 - 00:25:19.166, Speaker B: They put scare quotes around the word mainnet in their own blog title.
00:25:19.358 - 00:25:27.460, Speaker A: In the ZK context, the zero knowledge roll up rollouts have been happening. Do we know is there anything coming up?
00:25:27.910 - 00:25:33.382, Speaker B: Zcash just pre announced the announcement of their new proving system.
00:25:33.516 - 00:25:36.162, Speaker A: Okay. This is the one based on Halo.
00:25:36.306 - 00:25:39.718, Speaker B: I believe there is.
00:25:39.804 - 00:26:07.060, Speaker A: In terms of the roll up world, though, I know like Hermes should be. I mean, I know that there's a trusted setup going on, I think for them as well right now that I want to potentially participate in. And that would be another L two ZK roll up coming online soonish. I'm just trying to think, are there any other projects like on the L two ZK side that we think that are coming? I'm kind of thinking of some of the previous guests and stuff.
00:26:08.390 - 00:26:14.018, Speaker B: There's going to be a major upgrade to ZK sync at some point, but I'm not sure if it's scheduled yet.
00:26:14.184 - 00:26:16.790, Speaker D: Okay, you mean the addition of their token?
00:26:17.770 - 00:26:27.998, Speaker B: I'm sure that's going to happen, but they're looking to add some scripting or smart contract functionality.
00:26:28.194 - 00:26:32.154, Speaker D: Yeah. I am actually pretty excited though about the case.
00:26:32.352 - 00:26:33.450, Speaker B: About the token?
00:26:34.590 - 00:26:51.920, Speaker D: No, the code. I mean the token. I don't really understand why at the end of the day, this goes back to the thing I was saying earlier. It was like if you could somehow make the whales subsidize privacy, then that's like the ideal privacy token. But I have yet to see anything that looks like that.
00:26:52.690 - 00:26:55.650, Speaker B: What do you think of the tornado cash token?
00:26:56.630 - 00:27:24.714, Speaker D: I guess mixers are a little bit like that in the sense that the whales are contributing, at least if they're contributing the most liquidity. Mixers make a little more sense for this than ZK stuff right now. Although there is this weird thing with, for instance, NIM has a token for their mixer, but there's something weird about it because if the distribution of the token gets really concentrated, you can identify who the main mixers are.
00:27:24.832 - 00:27:26.540, Speaker A: Oh my gosh. True.
00:27:26.910 - 00:27:29.082, Speaker B: NIM is the mixnet one, right?
00:27:29.216 - 00:27:50.162, Speaker D: Yeah. Which is like really there's like some trade. Like someone actually does have to quantify this trade off of like if it's too concentrated, you actually can never really have too much privacy. And this gets to what Josh is talking about. There's some trade off surface. But I do really think that somehow you gotta get the whales to subsidize privacy for the like.
00:27:50.216 - 00:28:14.218, Speaker A: But that idea that by participating a lot in the network and then being rewarded after the fact with these governance tokens, kind of the model that was popularized by Uniswap, that potentially that would actually undermine a private system because then somehow the identity of the most active users would be revealed by the balances in the wallets. Unless those two were done in private setting, I guess.
00:28:14.304 - 00:28:24.750, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think the UX is also annoying because you would basically be forcing the users to constantly be splitting their assets if you're going to try to make it look like it's not concentrated, but then they're paying fees for that.
00:28:24.820 - 00:28:44.020, Speaker A: Yeah. A question to all of you, and this is another kind of topic for this is a little bit thinking more about this podcast and actually any listeners who have additional ideas, please do get in touch about this. But it's ideas that you personally want to explore this year, things that are exciting to you.
00:28:44.870 - 00:29:32.034, Speaker B: I mentioned this earlier, I'm really interested in all of the kind of user and fee batching and pooling that's going on recently. So a lot of these DeFi projects are pooling users and splitting up the pool to get the highest return for everybody. I think that that kind of model can have a bunch of applications. So maybe trying to at the lowest interest rate on borrowing for a large pool of users or kind of other things in that area. This way that we're saying, okay, the layer one is not scaling, it doesn't serve all users needs. So we're providing a way to batch users and fill all of their needs together and that's more efficient for everyone.
00:29:32.232 - 00:29:40.520, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess examples, would you put ZK roll ups in that category or would you think more on the DeFi yearn kind?
00:29:41.290 - 00:30:03.870, Speaker B: Know, I've been thinking more about the DeFi yearn harvest kind of thing, but roll ups also fit that bill is you're letting users opt into this other system with different trust assumptions in order to get group benefits. Rollups also do this nice thing where they allow people who aren't part of that system to avoid paying for it.
00:30:04.020 - 00:30:09.310, Speaker A: What about you Tarun? What's in your mind? What are the ideas that you want to explore?
00:30:09.650 - 00:30:19.170, Speaker D: Well, I guess as they would say, Alpha leaked my top thing I wrote in my little notes, which was how do you finance privacy?
00:30:20.070 - 00:30:22.100, Speaker A: Alpha leaked it earlier in the show.
00:30:22.710 - 00:30:23.460, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:26.090 - 00:30:28.520, Speaker A: Not a big wide Alpha there, is there?
00:30:31.290 - 00:31:12.562, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. I think kind of a related question to what James was thinking about. It's something that I started thinking about around SBC with some people I met at Stanford and then of course the world blew up and then somehow it got lost in March and I don't know if it's coming back, but it's kind of like pre yearn. There was this idea of like, okay, if L2s that are optimistic or not, ZK force validators to place collateral and then they're validating many people's transactions, they're effectively doing the same batching thing.
00:31:12.616 - 00:31:12.834, Speaker A: Right?
00:31:12.872 - 00:32:13.042, Speaker D: Like everyone who's using the L2, all their transactions are getting approved by the layer one in a batch. Like on. Every little infrequent right to the main chain, whether it's during a challenge or whether or not there's some way you can view that validator main chain interaction is batching all the L2 users. And so the question was, what does the transaction fee market look like? If you say x percent of transactions are L2, and you vary X from zero to 100, at some point when it's all L2s, the competition is quite different versus it all being individual users. And so that was kind of something I was thinking a lot about because the zero knowledge proof generation market is quite different and we couldn't put our finger on exactly why, but there's some quantitative difference between batching many L2s competing for blocksface versus ZKP roll ups.
00:32:13.186 - 00:32:20.870, Speaker A: But it is an L two. Wouldn't it also need to be batched in what you described? It's just one of what is batched.
00:32:20.950 - 00:33:07.078, Speaker D: No, it is, but the security model is weird. Like, theoretically, it really doesn't even need a token. It could just be someone relaying a single ZKP for a sequence of state updates versus optimistic style stuff. You actually have to lock up collateral almost in the same way that when you deposit to urine, you've given them your collateral. Okay, so there's less of this finance game and more of a timing game. And so somehow quantifying that spectrum, and that includes these urine type of things. There's kind of this simplex triangle of these three things, and I don't know exactly how you describe them, but there's probably some way to describe all three of them, and each of them are limits of that.
00:33:07.078 - 00:33:15.546, Speaker D: So anyway, I was thinking a little about that in March, but then kind of got wrecked and so maybe now I'll think about it again, in a.
00:33:15.568 - 00:33:38.226, Speaker C: Sense, in that framing it would make a lot of the l. Two collateral lockups competing with the Staking lockups for L One in those systems, which would is that sort of what you're alluding to tarun? That there would be this new, currently unknown equilibria between those economic actors? Or is it something else?
00:33:38.328 - 00:33:48.840, Speaker D: Yeah, it's exactly that. It's that plus, if you add in something like a yearn, then it's like I have the same capital that's theoretically fungible over all three. How do I allocate to it?
00:33:49.210 - 00:34:24.034, Speaker B: There's a bunch of really non obvious engineering details around this, too, that are going to come into play. So, for an example, a ZK roll up that can't pay for layer one gas just stops making new blocks. An optimistic roll up that can't pay for layer one gas probably gets everything stolen after a while. And a kind of yearn or vault like thing that can't pay for gas. The funds are tied up and getting a suboptimal rate.
00:34:24.232 - 00:34:29.682, Speaker D: I mean, also, actually, if they're levered, there's potentially losses. Oh, yeah, right.
00:34:29.736 - 00:34:32.050, Speaker B: If they're levered, there's huge losses potentially.
00:34:32.550 - 00:34:33.010, Speaker D: Right.
00:34:33.080 - 00:34:38.520, Speaker A: This is a topic is there any project or anyone that you think is actually working on this right now?
00:34:39.370 - 00:34:41.960, Speaker D: Well, I mean, I did say it was something I was thinking.
00:34:44.330 - 00:34:48.630, Speaker A: There's no project. You don't know of anyone who's actually doing anything like this, do you?
00:34:48.700 - 00:35:32.466, Speaker D: I think we have to see a couple more of these things come online. I think the DeFi data actually is the best data set for trying to predict this because we had urine and it grew and then there was like a million copy pasta clones and the L2 wars are probably going to look kind of similar. It's just that because there's so much engineering effort, we don't think of off chain labs as a copy pasta version of optimism, but to validators to miners economically, they're just wow auction bidders who are all competing with each other. And so it's this harvest versus yearn versus rari verse. There's like 500 of these things. They're not even named after food anymore. So it's hard to just call them food coins.
00:35:32.578 - 00:35:35.080, Speaker B: I know, it's terrible. Go back to food.
00:35:36.730 - 00:35:37.730, Speaker D: Food was easier.
00:35:37.810 - 00:36:25.560, Speaker C: I could just say they ran out of food, emojis didn't. And I don't understand that realm nearly as not even in the same magnitude the way that Tyrone, you and James do, but the way that you start to describe it, my head just immediately starts wandering into oh, God. This is an overly complex system where no one has full visibility into what's going on and there is going to be some catastrophic tail event at some point. And that's just what winds up big red alarm bells without any real like I can't back that up beyond just gut feeling, but that's what it feels like, right?
00:36:26.250 - 00:36:30.250, Speaker B: Are we going to see the rise of systemically important food coins?
00:36:34.830 - 00:37:08.246, Speaker D: I will say another thing you're seeing a lot of is insurance funds in DeFi protocols. And I think L2s okay, this is a crazy prediction because although L2s are very like, they're all fighting with each other, like psyops wise for mindshare. But I think they're going to actually have to pull together an insurance fund for the reasons James is mentioning. They're basically like they're going to realize it's cheaper for them to socialize an insurance fund over multiple L2s for potentially losing block space versus trying to always compete against each other.
00:37:08.268 - 00:37:15.080, Speaker A: Wow. How many insurance funds are there? I am only aware of one, I think. But are there quite a few now?
00:37:16.010 - 00:37:22.238, Speaker D: Each DeFi protocol that has leverage right now basically has one ave and synthetics.
00:37:22.274 - 00:37:31.186, Speaker A: Have it explicitly like internally they have their own or do they outsource that? Is it within their protocol?
00:37:31.318 - 00:37:32.442, Speaker D: It's in the protocol.
00:37:32.586 - 00:37:37.214, Speaker A: When you say insurance fund, you mean like a pool of funds in insurance?
00:37:37.412 - 00:37:37.822, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:37.876 - 00:37:40.960, Speaker A: Okay. Not like an external insurance.
00:37:41.970 - 00:37:46.420, Speaker B: The same way that there's the Safu fund or whatever.
00:37:46.950 - 00:37:49.698, Speaker D: Or like the BitMEX insurance. Exactly.
00:37:49.864 - 00:37:50.482, Speaker A: Got it.
00:37:50.536 - 00:38:26.878, Speaker D: Yeah. Like an on chain visible insurance fund. So to Josh's point, there is a little more transparency to these insurance events versus like financial crisis where I think one kind of benefit of the current technology is in the financial crisis, all these homes were underwater in 2005 or six, but it takes forever for the mortgage payment person to not collect. Maybe they didn't collect for six months and then they have to go tell the person above them. And there's this whole bureaucracy that made it not clear. Whereas in DFI, if everything collapses, it's like it collapses in like five transactions, right?
00:38:27.044 - 00:38:28.080, Speaker A: So at least.
00:38:30.690 - 00:38:40.100, Speaker D: The market gets the information faster rather than having these kind of actors who are kind of taking forever to figure out whether they want to tell the world everything's blowing up or not.
00:38:40.870 - 00:39:07.606, Speaker B: The root of that problem is all of this hidden information in the bureaucracy is you have the mortgage which has been sold to someone else and a third party is collecting the payments and it takes time for information to become public through that process. Whereas if it's happening on chain, it is immediately public exactly when you miss your payment. All we need is people watching for that information. They have access to it, whereas previously.
00:39:07.638 - 00:39:11.398, Speaker D: They didn't on purpose. It was like purposefully obfuscated.
00:39:11.494 - 00:39:15.978, Speaker B: It was obfuscated so that they could create these incredibly profitable instruments.
00:39:16.074 - 00:40:10.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I wanted to share one of the new ideas that I want to explore, which was this is something I actually will hopefully find a way to explore on this podcast. But it's the ZK game episode I found just really fun to do. And that project I find super fun. And this is like moving a little bit, maybe even away from blockchain necessarily. But it's this idea of zero knowledge procedural generation and the fog of war and the connection between those things and where zero knowledge proofs could potentially actually lead to a decentralized gaming experience without no need for a central server and yet a kind of a trusted truth. And maybe you do need a blockchain in there, but I'm not sure. I think the most exciting part here is that idea that the Xeronoledge could provide the privacy to the fog of war but having truth be underneath it and shared truth among different participants.
00:40:10.270 - 00:40:53.390, Speaker A: So that's just a topic that I am curious about and want to explore. I don't know if you have any ideas for people who I should invite on. I mean, I think ZK, the folks that did ZK game are awesome, but I would love to see more people doing zero knowledge proof or to be playing with zero knowledge proofs in games. So I was thinking even of inviting some game expert and seeing if I could convince them to use it or like getting some ZK expert and a game person together so that they can start to brainstorm that. That was one of my to dos this year. And things that I'm thinking about. Another one that I'm thinking about exploring further is the Flash bots and mev stuff.
00:40:53.460 - 00:40:55.422, Speaker B: Oh, I was going to bring this up.
00:40:55.556 - 00:40:56.240, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:40:57.490 - 00:41:39.100, Speaker B: One of the things I'm kind of excited about is accelerationism. Like that. The goal of Flashbots is to kind of accelerate this mev system so that we don't build up a huge DeFi infrastructure, assuming miners are your friends, so that we start designing much earlier for the adversarial world, that we will eventually end up with. This kind of ties back to what we were talking about earlier, about this equilibrium developing between on chain vaults, ZK roll ups, optimistic roll ups, and other end state chain users is we should probably be trying as much as possible to accelerate these things, get there faster, so that it is less of a.
00:41:39.470 - 00:41:48.574, Speaker A: Shock when it happens, when you find out about it. Yeah, because it had been happening for a while. Right. But it was just more recently where it was discovered how bad it was.
00:41:48.692 - 00:41:58.658, Speaker B: Well, I think the thing that brought it to most people's attention was the Phil Dan's paper from I want to.
00:41:58.664 - 00:42:00.850, Speaker A: Say it's like yeah, it's actually 2017.
00:42:01.430 - 00:42:03.362, Speaker B: Oh, my God, it's been so long.
00:42:03.416 - 00:42:06.230, Speaker A: Flash Boys was The Flash Boys 2.0.
00:42:06.300 - 00:42:11.640, Speaker D: Yeah, we're old, James. It's okay. Just get used to it.
00:42:13.770 - 00:42:14.950, Speaker C: We're ancient.
00:42:15.610 - 00:42:27.658, Speaker B: So it's really great to kind of see a concrete accelerationist project for that. And the work like Georgios has been doing on mev Geth is really interesting.
00:42:27.824 - 00:42:54.770, Speaker D: I think the only thing I would add to that is there's a fallacy that I think other chains may run into, which is that they may try to over optimize for this before they have usage. And I actually think you should be accelerationist like, assume it's going to happen, but you shouldn't do it cart before the horse style, before you have any transactions because you're just going to make the UX terrible for your end users.
00:42:56.950 - 00:43:07.414, Speaker A: Is the Flashbots actually, I haven't talked with them, so I don't know what the exact project is. But is that like a research project or is that like designing new L1s to not have this?
00:43:07.532 - 00:43:12.822, Speaker D: It's a revenue sharing model with miners and transaction submitters.
00:43:12.966 - 00:43:17.894, Speaker A: But so it would need to be implemented into a oh, no, it doesn't exist.
00:43:18.022 - 00:43:18.902, Speaker B: It does exist.
00:43:18.966 - 00:43:19.830, Speaker D: It is implemented.
00:43:19.910 - 00:43:21.102, Speaker A: Is it an L1?
00:43:21.236 - 00:43:27.690, Speaker B: No, this is a modified version of Geth. So it's an Ethereum full node software for miners.
00:43:27.770 - 00:43:28.206, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:28.308 - 00:43:58.200, Speaker B: And what it does is it accepts transactions without transaction fees, checks if the transaction will pay the miner, and then executes them if it does. There's a lot more complexity there and a lot of interesting things you can do with it. But essentially what it's doing is it's checking transactions for mev and optimizing based on mev. And it's a normal Ethereum node that runs on the network today. And at least one pool is running.
00:43:59.290 - 00:44:11.086, Speaker A: Okay. So if a mining pool uses this node software, then it is actually already implemented, but it's not a hard fork and it didn't have to do any of the Ethereum governance stuff.
00:44:11.188 - 00:44:22.414, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not a hard fork. It's not a change to Ethereum. It is a change to the software to recognize this extractable value and extract it interesting.
00:44:22.532 - 00:45:04.430, Speaker D: And then do a revenue share between the submitter and the miner. This has already existed in bitcoin land forever. Like transaction acceleration has sort of like I don't mean to disabuse the kind of idealist notion that, oh, like miners non consensus part things, of course they follow whatever bitcoin core does. Absolutely not. Right. The mempool in transaction ordering is kind of the thing in general that is never in consensus because too expensive to ever be in consensus until we have some crazy ZK world where I can ZK snapshot my mempool ordering as I get transactions or something. There's really no way that you're ever going to put that in.
00:45:04.580 - 00:45:16.020, Speaker B: There's a really intuitive way to say that, which is the mempool is what you're going to come to consensus on. If you want to come to consensus on the mempool, you need a mempool mempool to do that.
00:45:16.630 - 00:45:18.660, Speaker D: And it's turtles all the way down.
00:45:21.350 - 00:45:56.750, Speaker A: All right, I want to continue on with some of the topics that I wanted to cover in this. And there was basically three terms I threw out to you kind of in some notes in preparation for this. It was the highest potential. So that's like highest potential outcome this year in zero knowledge blockchain, whatever in that category. Highest potential, stretch dream. Something that could happen, but it would be unlikely, but might be interesting or awesome. And then what black swan possibility do you think people might want to look out for? So let's start with highest potential.
00:45:56.750 - 00:46:03.678, Speaker A: This could be kind of anything. Josh, do you have a highest potential idea?
00:46:03.764 - 00:47:12.520, Speaker C: What I think would be interesting to see as something that would be the most, like the highest value that we could all bring this year or see this year, is if actually that some of those chains that are built with the multi blockchain blockchains that allow a great deal of interoperability, actually have some privacy focused chains on them, and that the inclusion of that might accelerate more private versions of DeFi. Maybe not in the way that we were talking about earlier, but a lot of that is like it's incumbent on those chains launching and being successful and getting enough usage to be meaningful. But yeah, I would love to see that. I don't know if it's going to happen, but yeah, craziest low probability event that could happen is just we follow the same cycle as the rainbow chart predicts and all assets rise in tandem and we wind up with a $10 trillion market cap for this funny money that we all have.
00:47:13.050 - 00:47:16.886, Speaker A: Is that your stretch dream yeah, why not? Sure.
00:47:17.068 - 00:47:38.622, Speaker C: I just want to see what all of just to be blunt, there are a lot of terrible people in our industry, but there are a lot of really wonderful people who I think would do amazing things with life changing wealth, and I would love to see what they do. Cool. So that would be great. And then Black Swan is like, wait.
00:47:38.676 - 00:47:43.082, Speaker A: Actually, hold your black swan. I want to do everyone's highest potential stretch dream. And then I'm sorry, into the dark.
00:47:43.146 - 00:47:45.074, Speaker C: Doing them all serially. My bad.
00:47:45.112 - 00:47:55.090, Speaker A: No worries. No to. I'm just changing courses. We're going through it. Yeah. Tarun, what's your highest potential likely thing to happen? And a stretch dream?
00:47:57.290 - 00:48:05.494, Speaker D: The highest likelihood is the gentrification of ethereum due to L2.
00:48:05.532 - 00:48:07.094, Speaker A: All the normies move in.
00:48:07.212 - 00:48:47.214, Speaker D: No, as in like some protocol, the protocols start clustering to different L2s. And in this fragmented ecosystem, it's like you have the DeFi L2 neighborhood, which is like the upper crust neighborhood. You have the CryptoKitties NFT neighborhood, which is kind of like trying to be cool, but it's kind of like is it like La. You know, it's like Williamsburg. It once was cool, but it kind of just is filled with sycophants who don't realize they're and then you have the remainder, which is, I don't know, just different neighborhoods.
00:48:47.262 - 00:48:47.858, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:48:48.024 - 00:48:51.878, Speaker D: I feel like the L2s are basically turning a single chain into a city.
00:48:51.964 - 00:48:58.360, Speaker A: Okay, what's your stretch dream? This would be like crazy shit that could happen. That would be kind of awesome.
00:48:59.930 - 00:49:01.586, Speaker D: Private decks.
00:49:01.778 - 00:49:04.970, Speaker A: You think of that as a stretch dream and not a possibility.
00:49:05.390 - 00:49:15.578, Speaker D: I think a lot of the people who are doing it are very smart. But I also think that you need to have a little bit of the delusion that you've already solved the problem before you realize all the pitfalls.
00:49:15.754 - 00:49:18.506, Speaker A: Okay, James, throw in the ball.
00:49:18.538 - 00:50:32.230, Speaker B: To know kind of in the same vein as Tarun thing I'm excited about and think is likely to happen is a bit of this disaggregation of DeFi and all of the Ethereum layer one stuff. We had Compound announce their app chain. We're having these L2s come online that won't be directly interoperable and composable. The way layer one is we're going to have to kind of completely change the way we think about DApps and DeFi and the way they all fit together to account for this. And I think it's going to be really fun and interesting. The stretch goal that I think won't happen in the time frame is a cheap, simple standard for connecting these layers. I think that we're going to have a bunch of bespoke bridges that don't work together with no standards around them for the foreseeable future and we're going to have all of these bridges to Ethereum which is an extremely inefficient bad environment for running a bridge and a huge amount of effort and resources is going to be spent bridging to Ethereum.
00:50:32.570 - 00:50:37.110, Speaker D: Unfortunately, I'm excited for this to be called project to come unarrow.
00:50:38.270 - 00:50:54.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm predicting disaggregation, and what I would like to see is efficient connections between all of these different neighborhoods in the city. But I don't think it's likely that we build a good subway system anytime soon.
00:50:54.308 - 00:50:59.018, Speaker A: All right, let's now talk about black swans. Bomb. Bomb. Bomb.
00:50:59.114 - 00:51:00.026, Speaker C: Bomb. Bomb.
00:51:00.138 - 00:51:08.674, Speaker A: I think the definition of a black swan is like, you're not supposed to be able to predict it or something, right? It's the most unlikely bad thing, something.
00:51:08.712 - 00:51:10.020, Speaker B: We all pretend is.
00:51:10.790 - 00:51:15.380, Speaker A: Do you what do you have in mind as a Black swan nation state?
00:51:15.750 - 00:52:19.990, Speaker D: OOH on a like, yeah, because I feel like everyone's kind of getting complacent, like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. PayPal is buying a ton of bitcoin and GBTC is buying a ton of bitcoin. I don't know, at some point I feel like on the march to 10 trillion, I guess, is eventually surpassing the GDPs of Germany and France. So starts to seem a little bit like, I think there might be some likelihood for that. The other two things I think that are black phones the end of the Moore's Law for zero knowledge proof stuff. Whether if you think of it in terms of pure algorithmic or whether it's like in terms of the coding, like the actual implementations kind of like if that peters out and we kind of are stuck with what we have. And the last thing is the ultra rug pull, which is like, somehow DeFi collapses due to insurance cascades, oracle failure.
00:52:19.990 - 00:52:46.978, Speaker D: And as much as I love how chainlink has somehow vacuumed researchers in a way that I'm kind of still no one predicted that, like, two years ago, if chain link somehow fails, there's a lot of blood in the streets or a lot of blood in the layer, two, whatever. I don't know what's the equivalent of street blood in the blocks, blood in.
00:52:46.984 - 00:52:51.378, Speaker A: The chains, blood in the mempool. I don't know.
00:52:51.544 - 00:52:57.590, Speaker D: Blood in the mempool already is being splattered. I mean, mempool is know, fight Club.
00:53:00.410 - 00:53:40.610, Speaker B: James black Swan events. So Trin brought up nation state attacks. Back when I started working on this, everyone was afraid of Finsen. This was back in like, 2013, 2014. We've gone through phases where everyone's afraid of the SEC and everyone's afraid of the CFTC, and now we're kind of back to Finsen and the SEC. I think, know, a black swan could be a new administration with a aggressive regulation policy. I don't think that's very likely, but it would kind of knock the wind out of the sales for most of DeFi.
00:53:40.610 - 00:54:35.694, Speaker B: What we saw last cycle was this innovation in token sales. We saw a bunch of different models of token sales, of direct on chain smart contract sales moving into these long term auctions, moving into SAFTs and other off chain instruments. We saw a lot of experimentation around how do we sell these tokens directly to customers. What we're seeing this cycle is a lot of innovation around Airdrops is how do we distribute these tokens without doing a sale. I think one of the other Black Swans I have in mind is that we kind of settle on this standard for distribution that is retrospective, and it causes a lot of problematic and unhealthy behavior that attracts attention or attracts regulators.
00:54:35.822 - 00:55:02.800, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. There is one new mechanism that I just recently learned about for that. I think it goes into this category, but it's like these work locks, like the lock drops on the Kusama network. I think this changes names sometimes, but it's like the crowd loan, because you have to secure parachain slots with a certain amount of KSM and participants could help you.
00:55:03.890 - 00:55:44.540, Speaker B: The progression from these work locks and lock drops and stake drops and through the SNX rewards contracts and into the Wi Fi rewards has really been, like, this fascinating amount of experimentation with how can we unfairly distribute tokens and call it a fair distribution? And we've seen some amazing innovation on that out of the Merkel drops and the retrospective distributions, and I think we're going to keep seeing innovation until some sort of Black swan happens.
00:55:45.790 - 00:55:47.942, Speaker A: All right, Josh, what's your black swan?
00:55:48.006 - 00:57:00.130, Speaker C: Well, I was actually going to approach it from the regulatory side as well. But the specific just to get to drill down and maybe suggest another horrifying scenario involving privacy is that let's say something maybe not the current. FinCEN rules, but other rules like it pass, and all of a sudden, every single centralized exchange is required to basically document the Second or even Third Order and acquire those people's identity. The big maybe Black Swan there that I think could have tremendous negative impact is not so much that they're doing that data collection, but that the data collection itself. Because let's get real. If it's done by banks and exchanges, what are the track records of banks and exchanges at securing this kind of data? It's not great. And I can foresee if there's ever any kind of hack that doesn't actually result in people losing monetary value, but instead results in, like, a complete data release.
00:57:00.130 - 00:57:28.234, Speaker C: Yeah, complete data release of all of these and effectively fills in the gaps and makes it possible for anyone to be chain analysis for a minute. I don't know. I kind of worry, like, if that happens and then all of that becomes very public, I think that people will there will be this illusion that people had about the privacy of these systems that just gets shattered, even though we all know that it works that way.
00:57:28.272 - 00:57:36.666, Speaker D: Now, to take the maybe Leninist view on this, maybe you need that to actually have the revolution.
00:57:36.778 - 00:57:40.366, Speaker C: Yes, that is totally fair, actually.
00:57:40.388 - 00:57:42.186, Speaker D: I mean, that is the silver lining.
00:57:42.218 - 00:58:11.350, Speaker C: Of that Black swan is like, okay, well, all this is out. Why were we not building these systems with this in mind to begin with. But yeah, I think that's the craziest. Oh, and the other one, of course, being like on the nation state side, what if there is some sweet quantum computer somewhere that someone's running and just decides to spend all the early bitcoin? What would that kind of I kind of want to see that happen.
00:58:11.500 - 00:58:20.902, Speaker B: Even a non nation state, just Satoshi showing up again with all this bitcoin would be a pretty interesting black swan. Hasn't happened yet, though.
00:58:20.976 - 00:58:30.126, Speaker A: Whoa. Yeah, when I thought of black swans, it's interesting. Mine was much more focused on the narrative crashing and crumbling and burning, which.
00:58:30.148 - 00:58:34.580, Speaker B: Would be perfectly predictable. That's 100% going to that's happen anyway.
00:58:35.110 - 00:59:37.910, Speaker A: But it's the idea that in a polarized place, some side gravitates so heavily to this technology that it becomes a virtuous thing to really try to stamp it out across the world, that governments across the world agree that this is not only is it dangerous to the infrastructure, but it's run by dangerous people. And I know there's hints of that, obviously, but so far it's a wide range of people who are part of it. There's a lot of different actors, kinds of politically, it's very broad. But my concern or this is like a black swan is that it becomes too much associated with one of the sides or quadrants or what have you. I hope it continues to be something that people are open to and not that it becomes sort of like the world closes their mind to it.
00:59:38.060 - 01:00:31.830, Speaker D: Actually, I want to add one positive, more positive black swan because I feel like we're all focusing on the nation state one, but I think there's a lot of people who are in the neck this year in particular, but between this year and next year who have been extremely oppressed by technological progress. People in Xinjiang especially, I would say COVID, kind of actually made it significantly worse as far as we can tell in terms of the internment camps, can't use money freely. And I actually feel like those people will drive usage for real life usage. That's like a black swan. That like the response to kind of the AI technocracy repression of, like, certain people actually leads to real payment usage.
01:00:32.250 - 01:00:34.134, Speaker C: That would be awesome to see.
01:00:34.332 - 01:01:07.140, Speaker A: I think we've reached the I mean, we've we've actually covered a lot of ground and we have some fantastic ideas to explore further in the coming episodes. I do want to ask each of you just kind of a quick I don't know if you have something to share, but what's next for you? Like, you personally? What are you excited about? What are you going to do this quarter? Do you have any projects or anything you can also shill? I shilled in the last podcast episode. So I feel like now we can do that.
01:01:07.590 - 01:01:12.846, Speaker B: Now that Frederick's gone, anything rules the shackles.
01:01:12.878 - 01:01:26.502, Speaker A: Are off, I'm going to be a crypto trading. What is new? What's next for you? Which one of you wants to start?
01:01:26.636 - 01:01:27.942, Speaker D: Josh. He's the mystery.
01:01:28.006 - 01:01:31.820, Speaker A: All right, what's next for you, Josh? I guess.
01:01:35.630 - 01:02:13.574, Speaker C: I am taking it a little easier than I have in the past, and so I'm advising a few folks here or there. But actually, my main output is, and I think I speak for a lot of people where I'm sort of disappointed with the quality of Troll and the lack of highbrow satire in our industry. And so, I don't know. I really love doing that, as many of you who might follow the twadcast on my Twitter account know, and anyone.
01:02:13.692 - 01:02:21.290, Speaker A: Who saw you present at ZCON One oh, yeah. With the black turtleneck. Full apple.
01:02:21.790 - 01:02:23.434, Speaker C: Full apple gear. Yeah.
01:02:23.552 - 01:02:27.066, Speaker A: Channeled, steve Jobs right there on stage. It was amazing.
01:02:27.168 - 01:02:27.770, Speaker B: Great.
01:02:27.920 - 01:02:31.578, Speaker C: Yeah. And I super chat on Libra. It felt great.
01:02:31.664 - 01:02:32.518, Speaker A: So funny.
01:02:32.614 - 01:02:37.262, Speaker C: Sort of an easy target, but, yeah, that was fun. That was fun. And I love doing that sort of stuff.
01:02:37.316 - 01:02:38.702, Speaker A: It was very good. Thank you.
01:02:38.756 - 01:03:01.240, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a great time. But I'm going to be doing more of that in a long form context, and my personal stretch goal, once I get that site out is going to be trying to become a little bit more like a Matt Levine of the cryptocurrency industry. So that's my little project.
01:03:03.210 - 01:03:06.486, Speaker D: Will you have text? Like, what media are you thinking?
01:03:06.588 - 01:03:20.230, Speaker C: So the media, it's just going to be like a real bare bones I'm not even going to use JavaScript, honestly. It's just going to be like text and an audio file of my voice reading the text.
01:03:20.400 - 01:03:21.694, Speaker A: That's pretty much it.
01:03:21.812 - 01:03:37.970, Speaker C: That's it. And it's an RSS feed, so you can plug it into your substac if you want. Doing RSS readers now, I know the future is in the past. We just have to go back, return everybody.
01:03:38.040 - 01:03:40.980, Speaker B: Can we get the Josh Cincinnati VR experience?
01:03:42.470 - 01:03:43.570, Speaker A: That's the future.
01:03:43.720 - 01:03:51.602, Speaker C: That's v two. I'm going to go from text and audio files into full VR. It's going to be immersive.
01:03:51.666 - 01:03:52.680, Speaker B: VR text.
01:03:53.290 - 01:04:01.610, Speaker C: Full immersive. Yeah, absolutely. It's just going to be like Microsoft Word art, but you need a Valve index to see it properly.
01:04:03.310 - 01:04:05.366, Speaker A: All right, throw to you, Tarun, what's.
01:04:05.398 - 01:04:18.058, Speaker D: Next for, you know, working on building a product? Also really know. I think I have a bunch of papers to write, but I feel like I do miss conferences.
01:04:18.234 - 01:04:19.120, Speaker A: I know.
01:04:19.890 - 01:04:24.190, Speaker D: Unfortunately, it has been less inspired lately.
01:04:24.690 - 01:04:29.362, Speaker A: I don't know if you've ever said anything about the product on the podcast. Do you want to say something about it?
01:04:29.416 - 01:05:00.140, Speaker D: Yeah. So we're building kind of like a prediction engine, risk engine for DeFi protocols that we're calling automated governance. So what it does is we read a bunch of on chain data and market data, run simulations every few minutes, and then kind of make some prediction. And if something is going. Wrong in your protocol. We'll submit a proposal automatically that's like, hey, here's the statistical reasons. Like, this thing is out of whack and here's the before and after.
01:05:00.140 - 01:05:04.974, Speaker D: This is why we chose this parameter. And then people can vote on it.
01:05:05.012 - 01:05:12.160, Speaker A: And it would be like, would it provide the resolution to that issue as well? Like the exact change needed?
01:05:12.610 - 01:05:45.340, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it would generate the code. It would generate the solidity code needed to do that and then it would basically submit it. A lot of the changes aren't even actually deploying a new contract. A lot of them will be like, change the interest rate slope to 0.8 and look at the results for y. It's kind of like people aren't really monitoring this stuff. But if there's going to actually be this $10 trillion thing, then Stretch Dream, someone needs to actually pay attention to being the Fed Black Book or whatever.
01:05:46.030 - 01:05:47.386, Speaker B: Cool. Very cool.
01:05:47.488 - 01:05:50.506, Speaker A: All right, James, what's next for you?
01:05:50.688 - 01:06:24.818, Speaker B: A lot of my time for the last few months has been spent prepping for the upcoming Sello Hard Fork. So that's going to be out in March and then I'll have a lot more free time and a little less stress. I think what I'm looking to work on for the next six months or more is trying to build that cross chain connection layer that I want to see in the world. We have some interesting designs for this and a new approach and I think we can make something compelling and try to get people to use it. So I'm going to be spending a lot of time working on that at Cello.
01:06:24.914 - 01:06:25.558, Speaker A: Cool.
01:06:25.724 - 01:06:26.534, Speaker C: Very cool.
01:06:26.652 - 01:06:30.010, Speaker D: James, the ethical Robert Moses of the blockchain.
01:06:31.870 - 01:06:37.270, Speaker C: I want to take that like 1950s, 1960s New York City analogy to the fullest.
01:06:37.430 - 01:06:44.320, Speaker D: Yeah, you need to make a subway map of Blockchains, James. It needs to have that iconic subway map like feel.
01:06:44.770 - 01:07:09.266, Speaker B: I think one of the nice things here is that I think I can maybe obsolete that pattern of these point to point connections and not need to subway map. I think that we have finally a good model for single producer, multi consumer channels. So we could maybe eliminate the need for that multi hop subway transfer routing map.
01:07:09.458 - 01:07:12.998, Speaker C: Anna, what's next for you in 2021?
01:07:13.164 - 01:07:56.606, Speaker A: So I guess 2021, I actually spent some time over the last two weeks taking that week off, thinking about what this show can be like, what kind of ideas to pursue, what formats to look at. Going forward. I will be returning to a weekly. I think it's a really good routine for me. I will be inviting all three of you to be guest hosts on various episodes on various topics. There's also going to be a ZK podcast blog where hopefully I will actually write some of these. But we're also going to get really smart guest writers to start writing deeper, deep dives on some of the topics that are covered in the show or have been covered.
01:07:56.606 - 01:08:16.058, Speaker A: We might also look back at some older episodes where we did this really great podcast but then never produced anything else with it. And it actually could use some extra reference material and all of that. So we're going to be playing around with that. I have Alex Pruden who's helping me on the blog and he's going to know, working with, coordinating new authors and all of that.
01:08:16.144 - 01:08:17.078, Speaker B: I love Alex.
01:08:17.174 - 01:08:58.482, Speaker A: Yeah. And the ZK Summit currently, I'm thinking of actually doing it one time per year and a bit later in the year and hopefully when we can actually do it in person. But I also think there's something worthwhile in having us get together around these topics for sort of like more like in a meetup setting. And so actually I'm planning on doing a monthly ZK sessions event, quote unquote, an online event, kind of like a meetup, kind of like a mini summit. And I want to do that. I want to kind of try to link that a little bit closer together with some of the podcast topics. It's going to be a work in progress like the blog.
01:08:58.482 - 01:09:31.166, Speaker A: And so this will be sort of coming out regularly. The first few might be a little awkward because we don't know what they are yet. But yeah, that's the plan. And then that would lead up to a new ZK Summit. The ZK Summit has been awesome and I did two online ones last time. But the online doesn't quite get that feeling of the in person. And it's sort of heartbreaking in a way because everyone's there and you want to chat with everyone in the way you would have normally done in a live event, but you can't.
01:09:31.166 - 01:09:53.754, Speaker A: And so that's why I'm going to push that back a little bit. I also think that online events, I did two days of 6 hours, which was like a lot. And I think a three hour once a month might be a little bit easier. We can all get together and stuff like that. So look out for those. I'm actually going to be releasing a blog post with the whole spectrum of things that we're going to do around the podcast. But I'm pretty excited about it.
01:09:53.754 - 01:10:21.042, Speaker A: I feel like this year I want to be a little bit more thoughtful in the programming and work a little bit more on having series like episodes that really grow off the other ones like our previous ones. So that's the current plan. I am so excited that you all came on this first episode of the year with me. Really looking forward to co hosting and yeah, likewise digging into new topics with you.
01:10:21.096 - 01:10:46.794, Speaker C: No, I'm tremendously excited this year just for it being not just a new year and it not being 2020, but also for Zero Knowledge in particular. And Zero Knowledge, the podcast as well as the research space, but I'm excited to help where I can, too. So thank you for hosting and having all of us on Anna Cool would.
01:10:46.832 - 01:10:58.720, Speaker D: Be remiss without giving you at least one dumb math fact, which is 2021 has a nice quadratic structure as its prime factorized, as 43 times 47.
01:11:00.850 - 01:11:01.918, Speaker A: Very nice.
01:11:02.084 - 01:11:10.100, Speaker D: 45 plus two. Times 45 minus two. So if you've ever had to go to interviews where they ask you to multiply numbers, that one is a nice.
01:11:10.470 - 01:11:12.900, Speaker A: We'Ll never forget that 2021.
01:11:13.590 - 01:11:27.640, Speaker B: Beautiful. Well, I'm really excited to be part of the show more often this year. And I also have a math fact, which is that seven is not divisible by three. Wish it was.
01:11:30.410 - 01:11:43.980, Speaker A: All right, so thank you all again for joining for this first episode of the year, and to our listeners, thanks for listening. You close.
