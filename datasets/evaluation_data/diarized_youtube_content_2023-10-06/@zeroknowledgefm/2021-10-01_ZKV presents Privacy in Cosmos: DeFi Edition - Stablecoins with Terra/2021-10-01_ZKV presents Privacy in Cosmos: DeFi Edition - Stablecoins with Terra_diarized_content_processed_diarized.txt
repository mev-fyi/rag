00:00:00.410 - 00:00:59.914, Speaker A: Hey, guys, I'm just setting up for the panel, actually, which is going to be right after me, and the panel is on privacy, obviously, and on stablecoins. I just wanted to give a quick overview of Terra to the extent anybody on the session is unfamiliar, and also how we think about privacy within TfL. So for anybody who's uninitiated, terra is a layer one chain that we launched in 2018. We are built on Cosmos SDK, and we use Tendermin Consensus, and we've seen a lot of growth over the past few months, even. There's more than 12 billion locked in our staked assets, as well as roughly five to 6 billion in TDL in our main protocols. So we've seen a lot of good growth in our decentralized stablecoins as well as our financial primitives. We're backed by some of the biggest names.
00:00:59.914 - 00:02:45.538, Speaker A: So I'm sure you'll recognize a lot of these names here, but whether it be Galaxy Digital, Hashed, Arrington, Capital, Polychain, Coinbase Ventures, we're very happy to call these our partners and investors. So to give a very brief deep dive into Terra, at Terra, we like to say that our main product is our stablecoins, and everything we build is essentially to make our stablecoins more useful. So at the outset it was a bit contrarian, but we felt that building a stablecoin and a thriving ecosystem is dependent on having decentralized monies, and we didn't see anybody innovate in the space. So for the initial couple years, we spent a lot of resources to build our suite of algorithmically pegged coins, as well as a use case for it, which was the U wallet and payment gateway called Chai, that is active in Korea. So for those unfamiliar, chai currently has more than 2 million active users in Korea, has a run rate revenue of more than $2 billion, and has been a source of inspiration for similar ideas to build out in different regions. So we have apps like Kado and Alice and Cash, Capult and Tick all building in respective regions that they are based in, off of a similar idea of enabling stablecoins for everyday use to hone in on the stablecoin themselves. We are an algorithmically pegged stablecoin, so we like to think of Terra stablecoins as being very different from the other solutions that are in the market.
00:02:45.538 - 00:03:46.466, Speaker A: So obviously, Tether and Circle are the leading stablecoins and they are fiat backed. And by their design, there is risk of centralization, whether it be the fiat that is deposited into traditional institutions or into securities that are traded in traditional finance, such as commercial paper or corporate bonds. For UST and our suite of stablecoins, they are all fully decentralized and dependent on really on chain parameters. And what that means is, for instance, UST, which is our largest stablecoin. The mechanism for stability and maintaining the peg is set by game theoretic incentives. So on chain, you can always redeem a dollar's worth of UST for a dollar's worth of Luna. And what that means is to the extent UST variates from the peg and let's say UST trades higher than a dollar, people can burn Luna and mint UST and sell that in the market to capture that arbitrage.
00:03:46.466 - 00:05:10.954, Speaker A: And to the extent that UST is trading below a dollar, people can do the same and mint more Luna and capture that market opportunity of buying discounted USD. So underpinning all of this is Luna, which is our secondary asset that weathers short term volatility. And personally I think there is a lot of elegance in the design of our stablecoins and Luna and in that Luna weathers these volatilities and is enabling these game theoretic incentives to play out. We are very proud of the fact that we've really never depegged by much. I think the most recent crashing in May, we depegged similar to other stable coins but have really rebounded since and have maintained a very tight peg to the unit value of each and every one of our currencies that USD trades on. And some of what that has been made possible by is our major protocols. So for instance, we have a protocol called Mirror, which trades synthetic assets and I'm just flying through these slides here and we also have a protocol called Anchor which is built on a savings protocol that is 1000 times better than what's available in traditional finance markets.
00:05:10.954 - 00:06:35.574, Speaker A: And what these two protocols as well as Chai have done is essentially build a mechanism and an ecosystem whereby there is organic demand for our stablecoins. I think there has been a lot of different attempts to build algorithmic stablecoins that are decentralized, which is really good, but a lot of these efforts have hit a dead end as it pertains to shoring up a lot of organic demand for the use of those stablecoins. Whereas for us, we've really operated like an app factory over the past couple of years, spinning up mirror, spinning up anchor, and have really created a need to hold UST. Because there are these different ways in which you can utilize UST to either invest in synthetic assets or earn 19 and a half or 20% yield fixed on your deposits. What we like to really say, and just to bring it back to the topic of the session, is we are truly decentralized and we believe that if DeFi truly stands for decentralized finance, it has to be built on decentralized monies. So UST and our suite of stablecoins enables that. I think many of the people who are familiar with our ecosystem would know that today is actually the day that we are pushing out our Columbus Five main net upgrade.
00:06:35.574 - 00:07:48.580, Speaker A: So with that, as well as some partnerships with cross chain bridges like Wormhole, we would expect UST to continue to flourish and really proliferate, whether it be within the Terra ecosystem or in the Solana ecosystem on ETH, on BSc. And our ultimate vision is to have a decentralized money that underpins all of DeFi. There's definitely aspects of which DeFi and being decentralized translates directly to privacy and secrecy. And that's why we have a partnership with secret network. We also have had a couple protocols in our ecosystem come up to the fore over the past couple of weeks, whether it be terabay or void protocol to build similar solutions for terra. So we're super excited about the roadmap for terra, and I personally can't wait for there to be more privacy within our chain, as that would be super beneficial for me personally, too. I know that we're kind of tight on time, so I just ran through those slides, but I'm happy to take any questions or leave it to the.
00:07:51.350 - 00:08:28.480, Speaker B: To for this panel. It's a little different than the previous one because we're actually going to be inviting three teams up who have built either with terra or on terra. In terms of privacy, we wanted, since this is privacy, this is like the zkv presents privacy and cosmos, but DeFi edition. We definitely needed to touch on this topic of stablecoins. At the same time, I know that terra itself is in no way private. Maybe before we invite everyone up, though, do you plan on ever being in any way private, or is that such a no no because it creates way too much regulatory legal issues?
00:08:28.930 - 00:09:36.246, Speaker A: No, I think we've been public about this before, and I think this is applicable not just to us, but a lot of protocols building on DeFi, which is the future of DeFi, should be that it is truly decentralized. And I think over the next couple of years, we will see a lot of developments in DAOs to truly enable the future of DeFi. So it wouldn't be a surprise to me if us as an organization follows a similar path to shapeshift or maker in dissolving and handing over the reins to our community. And we're already seeing a lot of that happen. Because I want to say, when I first encountered terra, there were two protocols, right? Like chai and anchor, or chai and mirror and now anchor. But there's hundreds of teams building on terra, and we're actively taking initiatives to continue to decentralize. So in addition to us, I would think that whether it be secret network or whether it be void protocol, all of these guys are thinking with that very specific goal in mind of only being here to set the foundation got it.
00:09:36.246 - 00:09:39.766, Speaker A: And letting the ecosystem do its part, that's pretty cool.
00:09:39.948 - 00:10:16.226, Speaker B: All right, I should probably invite the other speakers up to this. And in the meantime, I actually have one other question for you, but it might be so this was a question. If you had an algorithmic like you mentioned, there's some algorithmic stablecoins that you've created, how does that possibly work over IBC? Does it have to always peg back to something that's algorithmic in one chain this is what I'm not entirely clear on because I just can't imagine how it works when you move it outside of its so.
00:10:16.248 - 00:11:07.300, Speaker A: So if you think about the monetary policy of UST and our other asset luna, it only needs incremental, senior ridge, if you will, to maintain the peg. So it's not as if just because there's national export of UST onto different chains or via bridges that having too much of that spread away from our native chain exposes us too much risk because all it takes is, let's say, incremental amounts of luna to be burned to bring UST back down to peg or vice. You know, I think there's a lot of comfort in us having kind of the depth of liquidity obviously on our chain, but also knowing that the variance can be kind of fixed by activities on chain as well.
00:11:07.750 - 00:11:16.310, Speaker B: Cool. All right, I'm just waiting for some folks to join. Okay, here's one person joining.
00:11:17.450 - 00:11:20.406, Speaker C: Hello, how's it going?
00:11:20.588 - 00:11:27.110, Speaker B: Very well. All right, we have another person joining. Let's see if we I think we have one.
00:11:27.180 - 00:11:27.858, Speaker D: Hello.
00:11:28.044 - 00:11:35.180, Speaker B: Hey, how's it going? There we go. I think we have our last participant now.
00:11:36.510 - 00:11:37.078, Speaker A: Hey, Corey.
00:11:37.094 - 00:12:01.874, Speaker B: Hi everybody. So, yes, as I mentioned, this kind of panel is a little different. What I want to do is understand what each of you are working on and kind of how that relates to terra and to stablecoins. And I know that they're all privacy projects here today, so I think yeah, I'd like to maybe get started. Let's start with void, what is void? And maybe quickly introduce yourself.
00:12:02.072 - 00:12:56.930, Speaker C: Yeah, of course. So I'm BitSquid working on void protocol at the moment. Still very new. We sort of noticed that terra was a little bit lacking in the privacy space, and we're big believers of decentralization, and obviously privacy comes kind of side by side with true decentralization. So we're really keen to get properly stuck in. Really the base idea is still building a mixer, but we're really focused on trying to minimize the opportunity loss or the opportunity cost loss from essentially locking up your funds for six months, waiting for them to become anonymous. So we really want to make sure that people aren't being penalized for choosing to try and anonymous their money.
00:12:57.000 - 00:13:04.726, Speaker B: Really when you talk about so you're thinking of doing it's more of like a mixer, is it in the style of like tornado but only focused on.
00:13:04.748 - 00:13:36.850, Speaker C: A stablecoin so it is in the style of tornado. We essentially are mainly focusing on UST because, well, initially there's the anchor earn on terra already built, ready to be utilized, such a beautiful nearly 20% return. So we're really hoping to be able to actively utilize that on the protocol, plus other mechanisms which can offer people good yield while obviously anonymous their funds, protecting themselves as well.
00:13:36.920 - 00:13:42.130, Speaker B: Is there any special challenges that you found building this on terra?
00:13:43.270 - 00:13:47.794, Speaker C: There will be challenges in the reward claiming system.
00:13:47.912 - 00:13:48.302, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:48.376 - 00:14:29.298, Speaker C: We want to be able to obviously keep that completely anonymous and not have the yield just tie up exactly to what you already were looking at. But I think there's probably so many more advantages to being on this network in terms of the collaboration potential. As SJ was saying, we're essentially building the tools for the foundation. And the way we see it is especially being like a mixer, being quite a basic, simple principle, really. If we can build the foundation that allows other protocols to interact and use the anonymous features that we can provide through our pools, then it's going to be really cool. That's what we're excited for.
00:14:29.384 - 00:14:34.494, Speaker B: Cool. All right, so now I want to hear oh, somebody has some funny background noise.
00:14:34.542 - 00:14:37.350, Speaker D: I don't know if it's your chair.
00:14:38.250 - 00:14:43.880, Speaker B: But I want to hear from you. I'm not going to know how to pronounce this manger home.
00:14:44.650 - 00:14:46.322, Speaker E: Manga. Just call me Manga.
00:14:46.386 - 00:14:52.954, Speaker B: Manga. Cool. Sorry. Yeah. Do you want to introduce you're coming from Tara Bay, right?
00:14:53.152 - 00:14:54.474, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely.
00:14:54.592 - 00:14:57.100, Speaker B: Cool. So why don't you tell us a little bit about this project?
00:14:57.470 - 00:15:09.774, Speaker E: All right, hold on. I'll try to share my screen real quick because I got sort of world's first for the roadmap. We got well, it's not actually first we posted in a discord before, but.
00:15:09.812 - 00:15:15.186, Speaker B: Yeah, cool to share screen. There's just a screen with an X through it.
00:15:15.288 - 00:15:31.782, Speaker E: Yes, I just had to find the screen. I got small eyes. I'm sorry. So there we are. So where the bonus is basically where we are right now. We're trying to get the white paper ready and just put everything together we want to actually do.
00:15:31.916 - 00:15:32.358, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:32.444 - 00:15:34.760, Speaker B: Do you want to tell what you are?
00:15:35.450 - 00:15:36.150, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:15:36.300 - 00:15:36.758, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:15:36.844 - 00:16:11.810, Speaker E: So basically we're your bitcoin mixer that you already know from all the other bitcoin mixers. But we take advantage of what Terra has to offer and make sure users are incentivized for providing a pool of money that we can shuffle around to keep things as private as possible. So there's incentive rewards. We were planning on a burning mechanic for then lowering mixing fees.
00:16:12.950 - 00:16:46.350, Speaker B: Yeah, that's very nice. I see one of your slides here has this question about IBC and this is something we haven't really talked about. I also didn't just mention that with like what I see here is something that would sit on Terra specifically. But what does happen in the case of these when you're trying to get would you actually be bridging yourself to other networks or would everything happen on the Terra network? And this actually goes to both of you, to BitSquid and Manga, I don't know if I said that right.
00:16:46.500 - 00:17:17.494, Speaker E: Yeah, no, you did it's okay, cool. So we're still looking at this, but this is only like we put this up there as vision because we want to get the blade and the swap mix done first. Got it. But after that we'll be looking into the whole IBC thing because moving things into different chains perhaps definitely adds another layer of privacy. We don't have a specific method of implementation yet, though.
00:17:17.692 - 00:17:30.606, Speaker B: And as we learned, it might be an added layer of privacy, but it might also not be some reveals the minute you leave. What about you? BitSquid from void. And then after this, I'm going to talk to you.
00:17:30.628 - 00:17:59.714, Speaker C: Carter yeah, at this stage, 100% planned to just be on the Terra blockchain, really just focus on that one use case. We've been longtime fans and followers of Secret Network as well and absolutely applaud what's going on over there. So, yeah, we're focused on just providing a solution just native to the Terra blockchain. And yeah, just keeping it simple but giving people access to good yield.
00:17:59.842 - 00:18:18.794, Speaker B: Very cool. Carter, I want to hear from you. Let's hear about secret. We have had you speak or not you, but Asaf from the Secret team spoke at the previous zero knowledge validator Cosmos event, but not in the context of Terra. But why don't we hear a little bit about Secret and what you guys are up to?
00:18:18.992 - 00:19:20.462, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the opportunity with IBC for cross chain smart contract calls is going to be super interesting with how Terra applications are going to be able to interact with a privacy layer. We're already seeing like, wrapped privacy for UST, which is amazing right now, in DeFi, it's very clear that institutional investors, retail investors, in the next two, three, four years, we have to have privacy attached to, like, we have whale trackers. More and more people are being pushed to OTC. So I think one of the biggest visions of secret network is build out an entire application layer that starts private by default, public by really. I think a lot of these talks today, they're trying to solve the problem that we have these transparent chains and we're trying to make things private and so trying to go that route. I applaud the efforts and there's going to be amazing innovation we see on that front. But the best way is starting private by default and then moving to transparent chain in many ways.
00:19:20.462 - 00:19:36.870, Speaker D: So specifically, one really cool project. I'm the lead economist and researcher for Shape Protocol. We're actually building an algorithmic stablecoin similar to the Terra Luna model. So that's super fun. We have that in the works and also privacy preserving synthetic assets.
00:19:37.530 - 00:19:44.962, Speaker B: Carter, what's the relationship between Secret and Terra today? Like, how would it interact with Secret.
00:19:45.026 - 00:20:20.658, Speaker D: Or vice the we have a bridge in the works. So Columbus five hooray, right. Plus plus IBC, and it's going to give people the opportunity to move UST into a privacy preserving version by default. So the dream would be really two options. People start building applications, like, tied to the real world on Secret Network that utilize UST. Right? That would be a great option. Second option is we utilize those cross chain smart contract calls to do something specific with application data, like authentication, stuff like that, just on secret network with a cross chain call.
00:20:20.658 - 00:20:38.906, Speaker D: But then we still have the public version of UST being utilized. So I think a lot of people, as IBC is emerging, are realizing there's a crazy amount of opportunities with cross chain smart contract calls, but we don't fully know what it looks like yet. And that's part of the like it's it's all going to unfold in the next year or so.
00:20:39.008 - 00:20:54.442, Speaker B: So you just mentioned though, like secrets privacy by default, but when you're interacting with these non private chains, what does that do? How does that actually affect secret? And is there a way for people to actually trace through it potentially?
00:20:54.586 - 00:21:24.582, Speaker D: Oh, for sure. I mean, the instant you leave like a privacy preserving ecosystem, you're shifting tech stacks. You can't just magically have your token on the other end have privacy. So I think with Penumbra and some of these other mixers, I think there'll be an opportunity to have a layer of secret network mixer UST, I think that'll be we could see an entire ecosystem emerge on that front. But you are correct, you can't just magically wrap privacy onto public blockchains yet there's solutions for it and we'll see what happens.
00:21:24.716 - 00:21:33.722, Speaker B: Is there any way that terabay or void and secret have some sort of interaction? Is this something that's being should they.
00:21:33.776 - 00:21:39.180, Speaker D: Should reach out to me? Guys, we got some amazing developers on secret network. I'd love to see what we can make happen.
00:21:39.870 - 00:21:54.830, Speaker B: Yeah, and kind of going back to the topic we talked about in the previous session with bridges, you're building these bridges, are your bridges special or would you say like you kind of go into in secret, you go into sort of a transparent format and then bridge over?
00:21:54.980 - 00:22:31.206, Speaker D: Well, we have one of the world's first privacy to privacy bridges. So people don't know, but there's an XMR to secret network bridge, a Monero to secret network bridge. So some people are calling it Darkfi, like some very interesting stuff. I know, it's an interesting name. We've also seen there's a bitcoin bridge coming out called Shinobi Protocol and they're trying to do a trustless bridge with contract to contract calls, with hash verification. There's some really interesting architecture emerging that utilizes SGX, utilizes the fact that we have a guarantee, albeit there's plenty of privacy maximalists out there that are concerned about SGX. Totally fair criticisms.
00:22:31.206 - 00:22:36.750, Speaker D: But we're building, we're doing the interesting applications and we're seeing a lot emerge on that front.
00:22:36.900 - 00:22:58.594, Speaker B: And I was actually about to mention that know, at the beginning in Sonny's talk, he was kind of going through a run through of these different privacy techniques on the mev front. SGX is being used by some teams for that. I guess I have two questions here, like are you doing something with mev? Does it matter in your context? And also, are you looking for alternatives to SGX ever?
00:22:58.712 - 00:23:13.370, Speaker D: Mev is just like solved, period. Like when you're private by default, all of our applications front rings, just like, literally not a thing. So that's why it's interesting to watch these transparent chains. They're desperately trying to solve it, and then it's just like our application layer. It's just not really a problem.
00:23:13.520 - 00:23:18.940, Speaker B: Okay, and then the other question was, are you ever going to not use it?
00:23:19.710 - 00:23:49.830, Speaker D: I mean, the cool part about all this stuff is you can have smart contracts on secret network that are totally transparent if you want. You don't have to have it's up to the programmers. You have granular control over what is and isn't publicly visible. So that's kind of the beauty of it. We give that freedom and that choice to users, but everyone collectively likes what we call the Snip 20 standard. It's like an ERC 20 token equivalent, but like privacy preserving. And yes, Patrick just linked an article where I talk about SGX and kind of that whole discussion, if anyone wants to read that.
00:23:49.980 - 00:23:58.970, Speaker B: Given that this is the ZK validator event, I do wonder if there's any ZK or plans for ZK in any of your projects.
00:24:00.510 - 00:24:36.200, Speaker D: We talked with some people from Zcash Foundation@main.net 2021. This is ref huge fans of Zcash, so who knows where that could lead? No promises right now, but I think the privacy narrative is going to be so strong in the next year or two. So collectively, every single mixer, every single privacy layer one, layer two, whatever have you, we all should push together to connect because it's inevitable, it's an unavoidable problem and there's so much value locked up in solving the privacy problem. And so many people today, privacy and cosmos are doing that.
00:24:37.290 - 00:24:39.510, Speaker B: What about Void and Terra Bay?
00:24:41.290 - 00:24:57.754, Speaker C: It's a good question. Honestly, not 100% sure yet. We probably been three weeks since we've formulated the full idea plan and started hiring, but yeah, much to think about.
00:24:57.952 - 00:25:04.880, Speaker B: But what kind of privacy techniques are you looking at? Like, do you have a few options on the table that you're thinking about?
00:25:06.850 - 00:25:10.400, Speaker C: Yeah, really?
00:25:11.810 - 00:25:12.560, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:25:13.750 - 00:25:30.680, Speaker C: Really? Just using the essential idea of the base chunk deposits to give the set amounts, and then of course, after it being stored for X amount of time, then yeah.
00:25:32.330 - 00:25:36.386, Speaker B: What about manga for terabyt?
00:25:36.578 - 00:25:37.538, Speaker E: Yeah, you said it right.
00:25:37.564 - 00:25:45.258, Speaker B: Don't worry, you can see every time I'm like, I know French anyway, sorry.
00:25:45.424 - 00:25:52.878, Speaker E: No, I'm German. The question was if we're going to implement Zcash or no, if you're going.
00:25:52.884 - 00:26:01.150, Speaker B: To implement zero knowledge tech, basically zero knowledge tech, or what kind of privacy tech are you thinking of exploring?
00:26:02.450 - 00:26:24.326, Speaker E: That's also something I'd say for the future, right? I mean, I don't really see how we would implement something like that into your standard Bitcoin mixer with reward incentives and a swap involved, but it's never good to say, no, I'm going to just do my homework today on how we could possibly implement this today or.
00:26:24.348 - 00:27:07.270, Speaker B: Not today, but a little bit longer than a day. But there's a lot of people in the zero knowledge community, which Zkv is kind of like, at least the podcast that I'm doing, and Zero knowledge Value, that's, like, a lot of the people in our community are focused on zero knowledge stuff. So you have plenty of people in this event and also in any of the other channels if you want to find out more. Cool. So, listen, I don't know if there's anything else that any of you want to share, but I kind of want to, like I think we're almost at the end of this session, at the end of this event, actually. Yeah. Is there any sort of last thoughts you want to share about privacy or the projects that you're working on or terra or stablecoins or IBC?
00:27:11.210 - 00:27:47.906, Speaker D: I know we labeled this as specifically for stablecoins, and I think it's one of those things where we cannot if I went and bought an ice cream cone one day with a stablecoin, and suddenly, you know, my entire balance and my entire transaction history since the beginning of time, we can't have that. Web Two has more privacy than Web Three does, so we have to have privacy. And I hope we keep having privacy and Cosmos events, because I think we're seeing institutional Interest head in the privacy direction too. So that would be my final thing. Check out Secret Network and really interesting talks today.
00:27:48.008 - 00:27:50.020, Speaker B: Thanks so much. All right.
00:27:50.710 - 00:28:03.640, Speaker E: I got something similar to that. I recently read an article on how I think it was a Swiss insurance company is now letting you pay insurance with Bitcoin so they figure out how much net worth you actually have.
00:28:06.010 - 00:28:08.282, Speaker B: It's a little poison pill right there. That's interesting.
00:28:08.336 - 00:28:13.770, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. So that's why we need privacy.
00:28:14.510 - 00:28:17.834, Speaker B: Understood. BitSquid last thought.
00:28:17.872 - 00:28:49.318, Speaker C: Yeah. On that. I think when it comes to the real world and privacy, I think as soon as you want it, people automatically assume that you're being nefarious or dodgy. But in the financial world, I don't think a lot of people think what it means when you sign up for a bank and they've got 25 years of your entire life just automatically there of your entire financial career, and there's no it's all transparent for them, which is no good for just a little guy then.
00:28:49.404 - 00:28:56.050, Speaker B: And imagine it was all transparent to everyone, and now imagine your business. I think that's where it's very powerful.
00:28:56.130 - 00:28:57.510, Speaker C: Little guy gets screwed.
00:28:57.930 - 00:29:07.334, Speaker D: Or institution that wants to take a massive on chain D five position. But they can't do that when the whole world knows exactly what they're it's just you have to have privacy.
00:29:07.462 - 00:29:22.058, Speaker B: Cool. All right, I want to thank all of you for coming on this panel. I want to say maybe, Susanna, you and I could say a few last words before we wrap up. Oops. I'm just going to thank you, everyone. Oh, you're muted, eh?
00:29:22.074 - 00:29:59.482, Speaker F: Susanna yeah, everyone was, like, disappearing as I was trying to, but, yeah, no. Thanks, everyone, so much for joining us. And as, like, posted in the chat below, please fill out the feedback form. If you want to support DK Validator, then you can stake your Atom and Osmo with us. And, yeah, we've got our website, our Twitter, our Medium, and if you have any questions that you want to ask directly, then feel free to send an email to the email address here. And yeah, Anna, if you have anything else.
00:29:59.536 - 00:30:26.290, Speaker B: Well, I think there's been a few questions about how to find out about our next sessions. Basically, we do these events every quarter. This was all funded through the hub, and that was amazing. And this is know, we're basically here to create, or not only create, but push the privacy community in Cosmos. And that's what these events are really for. So I'd love to see you back at the next one. I think we're planning it for, like susanna yeah.
00:30:26.360 - 00:30:29.400, Speaker F: So, yeah, it'll be about quarter one.
00:30:31.370 - 00:31:16.760, Speaker B: And the other thing I wanted to mention is that in the event chat, I also put something called the ZK Jobs Fair, which we're actually doing tomorrow. So this is separate from the Zkv. This is done through the podcast, but there if you're looking to dive into zero knowledge tech and work in zero knowledge tech, this could be a cool event because we have a bunch of hiring teams. You'd get a chance in a virtual environment to come up and talk to them, maybe as you're applying, or maybe you've already applied and you want to meet them before you actually set up meetings. So this is just a cool way to get to know a lot of the projects working in the space. And yeah, generally follow ZK Validator, stake to us on Cosmos, stake to us on Osmo, stake to us on anything else that might be coming in the pipeline. And hope to see you next time.
00:31:16.760 - 00:31:21.490, Speaker B: Cool. Bye, guys. Bye.
