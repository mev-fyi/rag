00:00:00.240 - 00:00:17.062, Speaker A: GM. So just a quick one before we get started. So still early is podcast for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Any investment decision you should make should be based on your own research and your own understanding of the risks involved. So, yeah, that's it for me. Let's get on with the show.
00:00:17.158 - 00:00:50.324, Speaker B: And they invited me to their private channels on discord, and there was like six of them. They all called themselves Dev. And, you know, I was like, tentative. I was like, new guy, didn't want to step over any toes or anything. And then after day two, I was like. I slowly realized, like, these guys really had no clue whatsoever of what they were doing. And I was, like, honestly astonished that they managed to, like, create all this buzz and get, I think they had, like 50 million tbl on the first day, which was insane.
00:00:57.584 - 00:01:10.840, Speaker A: All right, welcome to still Ellie and this guy who we brought on, as I say, I'm just buttering him up, needs no introduction, but he's saying to help the podcast grow, we're gonna have to pick on great guests. So fish from Trader Joe. How are you doing, sir?
00:01:11.032 - 00:01:14.164, Speaker B: I'm very good, thank you. Thanks for having me here.
00:01:14.624 - 00:01:35.484, Speaker A: Yeah, anytime, anytime. I feel like we've been passing ships on Twitter for quite a while. We never actually sat down and had a conversation. So this is the first time that we're having that conversation. I've had blue and Davide on previously and speak to blue quite a bit. So, yeah, finally landed the big fish, pardon the pun.
00:01:37.184 - 00:01:38.764, Speaker B: Yeah, you finally called me.
00:01:42.584 - 00:02:16.114, Speaker A: I said this when Blue came on the Block mates podcast. But I've got a lot to thank Trader Joe for, and I don't think that you might understand this, so. And a lot of people might be pissed off at this for the same reason. But when I first initially started block, Merton was churning out content and creating articles around emerging projects I liked, liked maybe two and a half years ago, three years ago now, I was just hitting a brick wall. And then I was like, right, I'm just going to do this one final article on no other than Trader Joe.
00:02:16.414 - 00:02:18.154, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I remember this one.
00:02:20.254 - 00:02:33.700, Speaker A: That blew up. So I. I don't know if that's a good thing for the industry or a bad thing for the industry, but after that, everything started to kind of fall into place from a bachelor's perspective. So thank you very much and, no, thank you.
00:02:33.732 - 00:02:58.954, Speaker B: Actually, I think, you know what? I think a lot of people should follow your footsteps and write good articles about us. Maybe that's the cut it will propel your status. Yeah. Become an influencer. Funny enough, we never pay any influencers. Like, people always shock. So, yeah, I mean, organic marketing, you know, we really appreciate it.
00:02:59.334 - 00:03:15.954, Speaker A: Yeah. That's amazing. How. How do you capture that in a bottle? What you guys have got from a brand identity perspective and why people like myself want to shout from the rooftops about you guys. Like, what? What? Can you put your finger on that?
00:03:17.154 - 00:03:48.982, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, you know, I think compared to the average DeFi protocol, we probably spend a lot more time and money into. I don't say marketing. I think marketing is such a big umbrella term. Like, there's so many different areas of marketing, but specifically branding and brand identity. You know, when we first started trader Joe, it was. I think we started, like, started working on April 2021 at the height of sushi forks. Right.
00:03:48.982 - 00:04:28.260, Speaker B: It's like every. Every day there was, like a new food decks or, like, you know, on BSc and Polygon, then Phantom, and then, you know, we are obviously a fork as well. But from a branding point of view, I was like, okay, you know what? I don't want to be an animal. I don't want this to be a food. Let's think of a character called basically Joe. Right? And we created this idea of. It was supposed to be a young guy because I wanted to resonate with people in crypto, and everyone in crypto is young, so it'd be like a young guy who's tending to the fields.
00:04:28.260 - 00:05:00.756, Speaker B: He's farming yield, and then at some point, he starts accumulating wealth, and he starts to, you know, do stuff with that money by lending it out. And then he eventually becomes bankruptcy, which is supposed to be our next product, the lending product. And then, you know, later on, he becomes like, this, you know, rich guy. So I pitched that idea to this artist I found who is from Russia, and he. He understood none of it. And I kind of gave him the.
00:05:00.780 - 00:05:02.584, Speaker A: Name of the guy with a whiteboard.
00:05:02.964 - 00:05:45.278, Speaker B: Yeah. I said, like, hey, like, you know, a farmer, like, kind of american style, maybe wearing, like, some, you know, what's called, like, plaid shirts and stuff and overalls. And then he just came back with this drawing of this pretty old fat guy, which looked like Santa Claus. And you just looked at it and you just, like, you look at him and I think maybe you remember that original drawing, but, like, the second you look at him, you're like, wow, that's so funny. And, yeah, I think, yeah, just simple things like that, like, really resonates with people. I think we've always wanted to be different from a branding point of view. And, yeah, it's definitely just paid off 100%.
00:05:45.446 - 00:06:04.404, Speaker A: So what? I think I might have heard you maybe tweet about this before, but I'd love to just hear about as much or as little detail as you want to go into, but on your kind of origin story into the space, I'd love to just kind of hear that from straight from the source, as it were.
00:06:04.784 - 00:06:35.234, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I got involved. So I used to be a doctor and I did med school. I practiced for a couple of years, did a bit of general medicine, general surgery. Then I was kind of like, sure. I was not going to complete my training, so I was just jumping around stuff, trying to figure out things, and I just decided to pick up coding just because, you know, I've always just enjoyed doing stuff and building stuff. Like, you know, I see a lot of art and stuff. So I thought, oh, maybe I might enjoy building something with code.
00:06:35.234 - 00:07:08.892, Speaker B: That whole act of building something is like, I never got that satisfaction from medicine. Most of the time you're just like, diagnosing and giving people medicine and stuff. And then I picked it up and then I learned, actually, I discovered bitcoin around the same time. So this was like a few months, just before the ICO boom in 2017. And obviously I felt like I was a genius. I bought bitcoin in it and I learned about altcoins. And then I found out, like, some of my old school friends were investing and were just like, degenering and grinding ICo whitelist.
00:07:08.892 - 00:07:34.064, Speaker B: And I was like, man, life is easy. And then 2018 hit and obviously I round tripped the whole thing. I kind of realized, shit, I'm a really fucking bad trader. I should probably just stick to building instead. So I decided, you know what? I want to come back to space. But trading was just too stressful. I want to be building.
00:07:34.064 - 00:08:30.094, Speaker B: And I had the opportunity to. I was basically a self taught dev at that time, and I had the opportunity to go work in some startups and stuff, but I wanted to really get into nitty gritty of, like, how blockchains work, like, the consensus algorithms, you know, like, I could make web apps, but I didn't really understand, like, the EVM, for example. So I went back to school and did a master's in computer science. I actually got two degrees because I just wanted to, like, do as many courses and catch up as much as possible because I was like a 30 year old versus, like, all these, you know, young and 20 somethings. So, yeah, I mean, I did that for two and a half years. I literally did not touch crypto for a long time, until I met a guy at school and in the last year, and he was, like, a big chain lake Marine fan. And, yeah, he got me back into crypto.
00:08:30.094 - 00:08:52.124, Speaker B: Like, I just liquidated everything I had left, which wasn't much. And, you know, he was, like, telling me about this thing called avalanche. Like, oh, yeah, like, Eamon and, you know, sir Sergey, you know, the prophet is, like, they're, like, best buddies. I didn't really get it. I was like, whatever, okay. I'm just gonna.
00:08:52.164 - 00:08:53.384, Speaker A: A link disciple.
00:08:53.844 - 00:09:13.926, Speaker B: Yeah, basically, I didn't get any of it. I was like, okay, you know what? I'm just gonna put my money into it. And luckily, yeah, I remember that day I got into the IC. I was really lucky, you know, got an allocation. Like, I think only maybe one third or 25% of people got into the ics. I was actually one of them. Fingers crossed.
00:09:13.926 - 00:09:22.514, Speaker B: Yeah. After that, you know, things went well. I graduated from university, got a job at Google.
00:09:23.374 - 00:09:23.806, Speaker A: Nice.
00:09:23.870 - 00:09:59.374, Speaker B: I was grinding, like, the tech interviews and stuff, and, yeah, I was like, okay. You know, my plan was, like, maybe I worked there for a couple years. Years, like, find my way up, learn, you know, how, like, big tech does it. It was a very good education there. I really learned. Like, previously, I did a lot of internships in startups, which was fun, but, you know, it's like the blind leading the blind. So I was glad to work in somewhere that was much more structured and people that are really good, and it's, like, so much infrastructure and stuff, but it was also really, really slow.
00:09:59.374 - 00:10:32.768, Speaker B: You'd spend, like, you know, I had to do front end, and you'd spend, like, a whole month just trying to render a box. And you think it'd be easy, but, like, the amount of tests you have to write just to render a box is ridiculous. So, anyways, after a few months, I was like, kind of. I think avalanche mainnet just came out, and some dapps were starting. This is February 2021, and Pangolin was there, and it was also well before penguins. Another one, I think it's called. Fuck.
00:10:32.768 - 00:10:50.024, Speaker B: What's called? Relay. Relay. Yeah, that was the first Dex. That was pangolin. And there was a bunch of other, like, dexs, and then. And then there was one called pandaswap, and everyone was like, oh, pandaswap. It's like a new uniswap v two fork, and everyone was playing the Dex rotation.
00:10:50.024 - 00:11:12.154, Speaker B: So I was like, okay. Like, I was like, fuck, I want to go, like, big on this. I put, like, six figures into that thing. And then I was like, so sure I was going to make multiples. And then the first day, I went up a lot right now. Yeah, such an easy game. And then within a few hours, it was like, people were like, rumors are spreading.
00:11:12.154 - 00:11:42.154, Speaker B: Like there was a bug in the smart contract. And literally, like, within a few seconds, like, everything just started dumping. I was, like, sweating and stuff. Like, fuck, what's happening? And then, yeah, I mean, it was not good. I was already, like, contributing to some projects at the time, so I had a kind of. I wasn't really working that much for the project, but I had an idea of, like, how smart contracting works. So I decided to volunteer myself to pandas off in their discord.
00:11:42.154 - 00:12:03.084, Speaker B: I was like, yeah, I'm a dev. I've been working for snowball and some other projects. Like, we'd love to help you debug this. And they invited me to their private channels on discord, and there was, like, six of them. They all called themselves Dev. And, you know, I was, like, tentative. I was like, new guy, didn't want to step over any toes or anything.
00:12:03.084 - 00:12:50.228, Speaker B: And then after a day or two, I was like, I slowly realized, like, these guys really had no clue whatsoever of what they were doing. And I was, like, astonished that they managed to, like, create all this buzz and get, I think they had, like, 50 million TVL on the first day, which is insane. Like, I don't think we have 50 million TVL right now on the quitting book. And they all called themselves devs, but I think only one of them, two of them were devs, the others were not. Definitely not devs. And the two devs, one of them was, like, one of them was a business student who learned some python for some data analytics classes, and the other one was, like, a computer science student. So he knew a little bit, you know, of some front end.
00:12:50.228 - 00:13:39.214, Speaker B: But I was still honestly shocked that they managed to even fork sushi or uni, whatever it was, and, like, even change the colors and deploy contracts. And I was really, like, trying to help them. And I was, like, working, you know, 14 hours a day, and they were giving me, like, a, you know, a small cut of the pandaswap tokens, which all eventually went to zero after a week. I was like, there's no end to this. Like, this is not going to end well. I kind of just cut my losses short and I just quit. And then, yeah, I decided after that, like, if these six idiots can create Dex and get that much buzz and volume, then really, this whole crypto thing is not so hard after all.
00:13:39.214 - 00:13:43.124, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's my origin story.
00:13:43.824 - 00:13:55.724, Speaker A: That's amazing. That's the best origin story I've heard. People just usually gloss over it and be like, oh, yeah, I did this, did that, and then that's it. But that was a. That was great. Thanks. I love how.
00:13:55.724 - 00:14:00.644, Speaker A: I love how Pandaswap has led to this monster that is Trader Joe.
00:14:01.464 - 00:14:02.360, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:02.552 - 00:14:04.976, Speaker A: Could you see how incompetent people were?
00:14:05.160 - 00:14:16.444, Speaker B: I think, honestly, if you ask anyone who is there at the time, like, pandaswap gave everyone PTSD, we still. I think about it. I'm like, fuck, I can't believe it went through that. That was just horrific.
00:14:19.104 - 00:14:54.228, Speaker A: God. Yeah. But then the. What, what happened with me when I first bridged over to avalanche and immediately looking for where people trading and what token can I buy or farm or whatever? And seeing pangolin, obviously, because pangolin, when I. When I first got over there, that was. I don't know if it was number one by TVL or volume or what, but I think a lot of people put a big bet on pangolin. And then you guys were there and I was like, this is like, I know it's a Dex, but this is like something like just the UI, the UX of it was just like nothing I'd ever seen before.
00:14:54.228 - 00:15:08.524, Speaker A: I was like, fuck it. I'm just gonna go with this one. I'm gonna go with this one. Obviously that played out very, very well because you guys kind of flip them. And then in the heat of avalanche, Roche, that was the glory days.
00:15:09.184 - 00:15:34.648, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, when we first started, we were like the 12th Dex in Avalanche. And Pangolin had like 200 million tvl. And then the second next Dex had like maximum five. So I told Murloc, my co founder, I was like, man, we can't just like, stealth launch and expect people to notice us. Like, we were pretty aggressive with our marketing. You know, like, we came out with, like, all these, like, I don't want to say fud.
00:15:34.648 - 00:16:14.434, Speaker B: It was more like comparison marketing. Like, you know, I was very much inspired by, like, the early two thousands adverts of Apple versus PC. I don't know if you remember those. Yeah, there's comparison marketing, right? So I was like, basically saying, oh, these are three things that penguin is doing wrong and these are three things that we're going to do better. And obviously there was like, a lot of drama because everyone in avalanche at the time was a penguin holder, right? So, like, oh, how dare you fud the number one Dex, you know? And then I was like, hey, I'm just, like, trying to improve what I see they're doing wrong. But, yeah, obviously I wanted to also make a marketing push and make it known that we were there.
00:16:15.654 - 00:16:35.336, Speaker A: Not gonna lie, it's like every pitch deck in the world now, though. Everything's gonna. It's like a box, that project. It's all got green ticks next to every. Every point on the chart. Yeah, yeah, no, I know. Those were.
00:16:35.336 - 00:16:54.288, Speaker A: I think if you could. If I could time travel back to any time, I think that was the most fun time ever on chain. I think it was just like chaos, but good chaos. There was, like, new shit popping about. You guys did obviously extremely well. Yeah, those. Those were.
00:16:54.288 - 00:16:55.324, Speaker A: Those were the days.
00:16:55.784 - 00:17:34.334, Speaker B: It was. It was unforeseen. Like, I think two months in, like, we had an initial traction to 20 million, 25 million TVL and they were like, oh, yeah, we have a chance here, but we're still, like, ten or 12% of penguins TVL and then after the first month, like, things started to trickle down and we were going down to 18. And then I think our token price started dropping to, like, you know, hitting new lows. And even my co founder, Murdoch, he was, like, worried. And we were thinking, like, we started making, like, you know, started, like, drawing up doomsday plans, right? We're like, shit. Like, if we don't make it, we're going to do.
00:17:34.334 - 00:17:53.914, Speaker B: And we were going back to fund us all. We have this project and people relying us, but, like, what if we just fail? You know? And then we suddenly, like, within a month, we just. Everything just skyrocketed. We're like, the fuck, like, what's going on? You know? This is absolutely insane.
00:17:54.494 - 00:18:18.270, Speaker A: Was it. Was it the bridge or was it the. Was it rush that, you know, like, what do you think? The initial, I suppose it was a culmination of a lot of things, like Ethereum gas was just fucking bonkers at one point, but I think the bridge got a lot of people over. I was, like, still fucking around with the X chain to see chain bridge. And then I was a bit butthurt that I didn't get, like, the GB token, airdrop shit like that.
00:18:18.422 - 00:19:02.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, definitely the, like, before the. The bridge and avalanche rush happened, we had been speaking to, like, some VC's, like, just through, like, friends of friends and stuff. We do have, like, some connections. And they were always like, oh, what are you guys doing? I was like, oh, you're a fork, you know, it's like, it was like one of those conversations, right? And then when the bridge happened and Avalanche announced all these like rush incentives, suddenly they were like, oh, we want to invest in you guys. Like they were like, I'll just throw money into anything, right? And we were the SEC number two deck. So we're like, okay, yeah, we'll fucking do it. You know, like, and then like, you know, it's funny, like we receive so many no's and then once you get like one yes, like everyone else wants to join.
00:19:02.120 - 00:20:01.164, Speaker B: And then they told tell all their friends because all these VC's they have like you know, they know each other, they, they often help each other with deals and stuff. So like they get, you know, their buddies on board and stuff and next thing you know is like you're oversubscribed and you have to tell people like first of all you increase around, like you increase the raise and then you tell people like as we can't let you in anymore. But I do think like having the backing, it wasn't necessarily like we needed the money, but it was more just the credibility, right? Like I think Pangolin had that stamp of approval. We were like this, we were still known as the meme Dex with funny memes and anonymous founders. So having like at that time like you know, three ac and mechanism and stuff like willing to back us with like a big stamp of credibility, you know. Yeah, people like, okay, these guys are, have at least been somewhat vetted by you know, well known VC's.
00:20:02.824 - 00:20:38.094, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And so how, how did the amm and trader Joe evolve to liquidity? Book what was like the main push for you guys to you know, start innovating and developing? Because there's not many who've truly innovated around concentrated liquidity. They can probably bring up a handful and everyone else is just forking shit left, right and center. So like at what point was it like you were looking at it and thinking right, this is the time to go and push some, some real innovative shit?
00:20:39.984 - 00:21:30.502, Speaker B: Honestly, we started quite early. It was like literally January last year. Like when the bear market started hitting, you know, we were like unanimously by that time. Like the number one Dex and AV lunch. But we, I mean, I don't want to say we, I'd say the smarter guys on my team started seeing, started foreseeing that, know, uniswap v two model was going to phase out and the Cl am model was like the way forward but at the same time like you know, we didn't want to just do a carbon copy of uni three. So we just got down to, like, researching and ideating. Honestly, I can't take any credit in, like, building liquidy book.
00:21:30.502 - 00:21:46.844, Speaker B: My job is to be, like, the coach and just make sure that I get all the smartest guys in the room. And, you know, honestly, like, we. I think the strength of our team is incredible. I guess that's. I'm, like, self bragging here. I'm a good recruiter.
00:21:49.544 - 00:21:52.684, Speaker A: Professional recruiter. You want to get yourself on LinkedIn.
00:21:53.544 - 00:22:45.568, Speaker B: Honestly, like, we don't do, like, the whole, you know, we do have a job support, but most of the guys, especially in the early days, were recruited just through, like, telegram and discord and Twitter. Like Mountain Farmer, for example, he's our, you know, our head researcher, and he's the guy who basically architected most of the liquidity book. He was just a guy in telegram from day one, and he was commenting on, you know, our mission and liquidity pools and giving us suggestions. And then we kind of noticed, oh, this guy seems kind of smart. So we just, like, dmed him kind, kind of like, throw some curveball questions to see, you know, where his head's at and, and then, like, ask him, like, oh, what's your background? Turns out he, you know, he's a quant for Tri fight. And it's like, okay, like, you know, and then this is usually how we hire people. And then we offer them, like a, like a part time gig.
00:22:45.568 - 00:23:19.714, Speaker B: Hey, you want to come on board? And eventually they're like, they like it, and then they join full time. So, like, we had, you know, I think we've been blessed to hire some fantastic guys, not just mountain farmer, but also engineers. And, yeah, my job in early last year was basically just to start a research group for job. And I think there was about five of us in total. You know, I don't have any experience in research. I don't never publish the paper. I mean, I have written.
00:23:19.714 - 00:24:10.614, Speaker B: I've had, dude, I've had to do, like, you know, journal clubs and stuff. So I have, like, a little bit of experience. But, like, I basically said, like, hey, let's just start doing case studies and start seeing what's around, right? So we started, like, doing case studies on uniswap e three, obviously, and curve e two, also looking at some other interesting things, like GMX at time was rising. There was also, like, other names, like primitive, Croc swap had just announced they were going to do something. So we're kind of just like, scouring the landscape and then you know, also thinking fundamentally like what is an amm, what is a bonding curve, what is an imp, what is impermanent loss? And yeah, we did that over a couple of months. And then you know, eventually the team, you know, decided, okay, this is what we're going to do. We're going to create the liquidity book.
00:24:10.614 - 00:25:00.954, Speaker B: It will be country liquidity amm, but instead of using constant product pricing curve, the whole price curve will be already pre discretized into constant sum bins. There's obviously trade offs, it's not necessarily better than Uniswap V three, but there are some pros and there are some cons and we felt like we want to build something different. But also we felt like this kind of architecture allows you to build interesting things on top of it that you're not, you can't really do with Unisoft v three for example like native limit orders, which we've now implemented, Unisoft v three, I think they now, well they will have it with Unisol V four, but in the old version it wasn't possible.
00:25:03.614 - 00:25:47.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's going to be, it's going to be a while away as well. I think I can imagine that. So, but from, from my personal usage and experience of liquid ebook, it's been fantastic from, from start to finish. It's been great. Um, was the, was there a large learning curve in, in the trader Joe community or did people, you know, throw themselves at it? Because I know you guys have done an awful lot of explainers, tutorials, videos, like, like all the literature around it to try and help on board people. But was there a, you know, that steep lining curve there for people to like initially give it a whirl or what were you hearing back like around the initial launch?
00:25:48.114 - 00:26:57.734, Speaker B: Honestly, when we first launched it? Like no one gave a shit. It's like, oh, we clean up this white paper, it's like oh great, like how is this going to pump Joe? You know, that's all they care about. I mean I feel like with anything in Defi, no one really understands what's going on, but what people usually do is they usually follow some, one smart guy, some super bigger brain who will look into it, right? And if this guy gives you the standard approval, then they will think better of you, right? You know, everyone does it, I do it, we probably do it too. So our job was to make sure that like we came up with some articles and content. Also documentation is very important so that, you know, we really knew what we're talking about, right. I think we made things a lot easier by having really good documentation that goes through how everything works, even down to like, you know, the code. Because if you go to contracts, it can be a little bit esoteric.
00:26:57.734 - 00:27:29.414, Speaker B: We tried to explain everything and a lot of developers were like, hey, like they would say on Twitter, like, you know, Trader Joe's documentation for liquidity book. It's amazing. And I feel like also the whole DeFi space was coming to grips to concentrate liquidity. So over time, as they got used to say, uniswap v three, then it made more sense of how it works with, you know, liquidity book because at the end it's still liquid, concentrated liquidity anyways.
00:27:31.134 - 00:28:00.774, Speaker A: Yeah. Now I think I know the answer to this, but with the likes of auto pools and kind of automating the liquidity management on what could be perceived as a more complex product, was that always going to get built in house? I kind of can see that you guys like to just build shit and keep everything under one roof. But was there any thoughts of let's, let's outsource it? Like, where's your head up with that one?
00:28:01.594 - 00:29:05.824, Speaker B: Honestly, we would love for people to build it, but like, it's, it's really hard to, for people to build on your platform when the de facto standard is unisoppy three. Like all these vaults, right? Like gamma, gamma strategies, Arrakis. I get them. Like, for them it's like, why should we spend the resources to build a vault on a completely new amm when the rest of the world is using a uniswap v three style fork? And the issue was we couldn't find people to build on top of liquidity book, where we found some, we had stake cut and stuff, but unanimously, like, most people would choose to build on uniswap e three. So we kind of decided, okay, you know what? We're gonna have to do this ourselves. It's part of the battle, I guess, and that's why we, we chose that path.
00:29:07.004 - 00:29:45.584, Speaker A: Yeah. So what, what do you think? Because it feels like it's an ever, ever evolving landscape and particularly the, and you're starting to see people look at different variations on top of it. Obviously, uni v four landscape opens up entirely. Like what? Even like RFQ is starting to creep into the conversation of everyday dexterity now as well. Like, what do you think it looks like in even two years, three years down the line? Like, does the Amm still reign supreme? Like, you probably thought about this a lot more than me, so I'd love to hear, like, where your head's at with all that.
00:29:46.254 - 00:29:57.014, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going through a lot of these questions because we're currently working on Joby three. I would say that.
00:29:57.174 - 00:29:58.206, Speaker A: No rest at all.
00:29:58.310 - 00:30:32.650, Speaker B: Yeah, just honestly, it's the thrill and the pain of crypto. Everything moves so fast. I would say that the problem statement that we're trying to solve now is much more complex than it was last year. Last year, it was relatively simple. It's like uniswap b two is not capital efficient. We need to build country liquidity, and that was it. Nowadays, I feel like in the amm level or Dex level, there's, you know, country liquidity is pretty much as good as it gets.
00:30:32.650 - 00:31:16.274, Speaker B: I don't think you get any better. There can be some improvements, like, say, dynamic fees to try and mitigate LVR, which is loss versus rebalancing, which is, like, the better metric to use instead of implement loss. But you're starting to see that AMM design has reached its limits. And if we want to optimize Dexs, it won't be on the app level, it will be on the protocol slash infrastructure level. So things like l one, l two block space constraints, you know, finality makes a difference. Right. You know how MeV is dealt with.
00:31:16.274 - 00:32:06.914, Speaker B: I personally think the next level of Dexs, that's where the innovation will be. Also, like, not every dex is an amm. You can also be a club, right? A central limit order book. I think there's a, you know, if you speak to a lot of, like, traditional market makers, they all tell you that clubs are the way to go. Like, they would never market make on an amm. Clubs are the way to go. It's just way better for, like, you know, if you want to market make well and profitably, you need to be able to create a lot of limit orders and then cancel them at the same time very, very fast on the sex level.
00:32:06.914 - 00:32:36.994, Speaker B: Like, they're doing this, you know, every, like, you know, dozens per second, right? This is how they do it. They would never market make on amm. It's just, you know, it's just very unprofitable. So. But on the other hand, it's like, amms became so popular because liquidity was so easy. Like, there was not much thinking to it, right? You just dump a bunch of tokens in there and you're good. You know, it's speed ran the whole defi adoption curve.
00:32:36.994 - 00:33:16.664, Speaker B: So I think there's trade offs here at some point. You know, I don't I actually don't know where the space is going. I do think that judging from what we're seeing in the latest developments with like, say, unisol four, Uniswap X, you're starting to see dexs start to resemble a little bit more like sexes. Some parts will become more centralized. The whole RFQ system really is just basically. I can see why it's good for traders. They're getting better prices.
00:33:16.664 - 00:33:51.014, Speaker B: But for liquidity providers, if you're a Dex liquidity, AmM liquidity provider and you're also competing with RFQ, it's pretty crap because during low times of volatility, the market maker is going to get a better price. They'll get all the fees, and then when it's volatile, that's like when you suffer the most LVR, they're going to be like, okay, see you later. And then the Amm LP's will suffer most of losses there. So, yeah, I don't know what the future beholds, but I think. I don't know. It's really hard to say, really. I think.
00:33:51.014 - 00:34:28.515, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a, there's a. If we really, you know, I think the goal of Dex is the eventual vision of Dexa should be to. To be better than sexes. And I do feel like a lot of amm, like Dex design is. We're always thinking about Ethereum, right? Like how to make it better on Ethereum. But the problem is, like Ethereum, the blockchains are way too long. You know, like the pool price on a usual pool in Ethereum does not get updated for 1215 seconds, you know, and that makes you really prone.
00:34:28.515 - 00:34:46.623, Speaker B: You have stale prices for that long, which is a long time. Get prone to arbitrage, whatever. There is probably a good possibility that the future of Defi will be on a chain that is not ethereum. It could be an l two. It could be another l one. That's personally why I think.
00:34:48.163 - 00:35:12.743, Speaker A: Interesting point. Yeah, I kind of agree with that. Are you following anything? What people are building on? Concentrate liquidity around like idle liquidity and any liquidity that's sitting outside in the current tick and like how people can leverage up. And there's a lot of new novel products that are coming out of it. Are you following any of that or.
00:35:13.204 - 00:35:22.944, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm actually supposed to do a presentation on Wednesday for it. It's the new narrative, right? LPDFI.
00:35:23.884 - 00:35:30.740, Speaker A: Yeah, we've, we've just got, well, we're not releasing yet. We're waiting for the new website to be live. But we've got a full report on it as well.
00:35:30.812 - 00:35:33.744, Speaker B: Yeah, because I need to use that for my presentation.
00:35:34.684 - 00:35:38.024, Speaker A: I'll send you, it's ready. It's just, we're not giving it away for free.
00:35:38.604 - 00:36:14.212, Speaker B: Yeah, I looked into, like, limitless logarithm, infinity pools. I really like it, you know, panoptic, too. I really like the idea. It's like, I think that's a cool thing about defi. It's like, you know, I think when we look at lever, it's like, how do we reduce lever? Oh, dynamic fees. Oh, do like, you know, rebate the LVR from MeV auctions, whatever. But I think only in Defi can you say, oh, what about, like, using either liquidity to lend it out and LP's gaining, you know, earning borrow fees.
00:36:14.212 - 00:36:17.424, Speaker B: Right. To mitigate the LBR. I think that's very interesting.
00:36:18.084 - 00:36:43.216, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very, very cool. Can money markets play a role in maybe idle liquidity, or is there a way that money markets can actually play a role with concentrated liquidity? You see what I'm getting here? Like, is that, is there anybody that could be. Yeah. Like, does that, does that factor into any, I mean, I think, I think.
00:36:43.240 - 00:37:30.934, Speaker B: There'S some, like that some new protocols are doing that. Right. You know, it's, it's like, what happens if price is so volatile that it hits that high liquidity? That's, that's the big question, you know? Yeah. I mean, technically you can, but you're also taking a risk. There's definitely going to be risk involved, and you can say that risk is minimal, but it's definitely non zero. So, you know, I personally think that I wouldn't want to do it just because it's so risky. It requires you to monitor things, like, really, really hawkishly.
00:37:30.934 - 00:37:39.134, Speaker B: You know, if you're not solvent, then that's gonna be bad. Like, people can't withdraw liquidity, right?
00:37:39.434 - 00:37:44.294, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, don't let me design a protocol.
00:37:46.034 - 00:38:04.560, Speaker B: I mean, it's an interesting idea, though. Like, I do like the idea, but, yeah, there's a lot of considerations. It's not a simple case of, oh, like, you know, the price, like, evacuation will never hit $1,000. Like, we can just lend that out, you know, like it could do. Crypto moves past, like, you know, never.
00:38:04.672 - 00:38:11.312, Speaker A: Possibility is the open on that avax for $1,000. I could really do with that right now.
00:38:11.448 - 00:38:12.684, Speaker B: I think we all can.
00:38:15.424 - 00:38:34.634, Speaker A: So on that, what have you thought about stars arena and obviously, recording this on the 9th over the weekend, the annoying exploit has happened. What have your initial thoughts on the app and the whole consumer social app kind of movement that's happening at the minute?
00:38:35.974 - 00:39:32.690, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the whole stars arena versus friendtech basically confirmed to us that actually friendtech was cool because you can tokenize your private access to your private access, like, people can buy you, but really, like, the real fun in all the social fi is not to have a lot of private chats, is to basically post publicly and share stuff and shitpost and have fun. Right. And I feel like stars arena did that way better than friendtech saying that, though. Like, I feel like the guy who built it, his name is the builder. I think, um, he obviously built this not thinking that people actually use, like, a lot of people use it, and it completely blew up. So I don't blame him. Um, I do think that, you know, a lot of the criticism, criticism towards him is a little bit unjustified.
00:39:32.690 - 00:40:15.180, Speaker B: I was like, yeah, I mean, he's not going to audit something, like, before he's launched. Like, this guy's probably just decided to pick up a toy project for his spare time. And even if he did have, like, I don't know, 30,000 lying around, it's not like he's gonna put his whole life savings into a project that might not even flourish. Right. But, yeah, I'm glad that, you know, it seems like people are gonna be made whole, and I think their top priority right now is to really hire good developers. You know, I think I heard some rumors that now, like, some people have joined, but I hope this, it's not like a part time contributor gig. I don't believe in those kind of roles.
00:40:15.180 - 00:40:21.424, Speaker B: Like, you know, team is important. Right. Like, have guys who are full time committed to the project.
00:40:23.124 - 00:40:54.604, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. I thought that the experience was great, and I was. Money comes and goes in crypto. That wasn't, I wasn't bothered about any of the airbags I was stuck on there. I was just more bothered about the fact that it was something that had, like, really taken hold, kind of captured the imagination of a lot of people, and then it was just like, fuck. Like, there was something really good there, and I think it will get, get revived and reboot, and it looks like it's moving that way, but it was just more like a bit of a focus that we're not going to be using that for a while then.
00:40:54.904 - 00:41:17.074, Speaker B: I mean, a lot of people are complaining. Oh, yeah, just a fintech for it. But, you know, astute product managers will know that there were, like, a couple of features that really changed it for Stars arena. Number one, the public feed. Right. That was a huge game changer for them. Number two, the fact that you didn't even need to buy your own ticket to start playing.
00:41:17.074 - 00:41:34.014, Speaker B: Like, it doesn't sound like a big feature, but small product features or UX features are really, really important for onboarding. And it just proved how pivotal it was. Because I think the growth in the first seven days was even faster than fintech. Right?
00:41:34.994 - 00:42:05.208, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. How are you guys thinking about. Because it's top of mind, because I interviewed the guys from privy, we've been doing a lot of account abstraction and consumer app and even mobile first research behind closed doors that we're going to publish. Is that a consideration from you guys? How do you get it in the hands of people? There's a lot. Huge part of the world that are mobile first. Is that any part of the conversation going on?
00:42:05.376 - 00:42:46.700, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, like, when we first launched two and a half years ago, we thought everyone used, everyone did defi on laptops and stuff, right? But we had a lot. We looked through our analytics and I think, like, more than a third of our users, you know, were, like, from countries like Vietnam. And a lot of these guys don't have laptops. They, like, they'll say, like, oh, can you optimize my mobile? The mobile version, please? And then, like, at that time, we didn't have a mobile optimized version, so all these guys, they had to, like, go to the Cyber cafe to buy joke. So that was like a big learning lesson for us. We're like, oh, okay.
00:42:46.700 - 00:43:16.108, Speaker B: We got to, like, really, you know, care about mobile. So, yeah, I mean, this is like, more Murdoch's domain. He's a very seasoned product manager. So we're always thinking about how to make ux better, how to make things easier. I think, for example, I'm sure you and most people are sick of going onto a landing page and then clicking launch app. Small things like. That's annoying.
00:43:16.108 - 00:43:24.124, Speaker B: And, yeah, we got rid of those things. But, yeah, anything to. To reduce the friction to get people on board is, like, always a plus for us.
00:43:25.464 - 00:43:34.184, Speaker A: Yeah. The recent switch to Rabi is. I still think, obviously, I love this app.
00:43:34.344 - 00:43:34.944, Speaker B: It's amazing.
00:43:34.984 - 00:44:06.628, Speaker A: Yeah, it's fucking great, isn't it, for an EOA? And I know we're gonna get to a point with account abstraction wallets and smart contract wallets that even some of the points that we use and accept because we're hobbyists and tinkerers, like, but even just switching from Metamask to Rabbi recently, if I'm going from. I don't know if I've just bridged from Ethereum. My metamask was still on Ethereum. Then I go to trader Joe on. On avalanche, and metamask pops up. Right? I'm going to switch a churn. Robbie's just like, yeah, we've already done it.
00:44:06.628 - 00:44:16.474, Speaker A: We've already done it for you. You don't need to do that extra click. But it's all those extra clicks add up and the user experience for it, it's just like a pain in the ass. But Rabbi probably doing good. Shit.
00:44:16.774 - 00:44:27.662, Speaker B: No, they're killing it. I think. Um, honestly, when D Bank came around, I don't think people took much notice of them because people back in the day was using, like, was it zapper or Zorion or some stuff?
00:44:27.718 - 00:44:28.286, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:28.430 - 00:44:29.422, Speaker B: But now, like, Zappa.
00:44:29.438 - 00:44:30.566, Speaker A: Zaryon. Yeah.
00:44:30.630 - 00:44:35.874, Speaker B: Yeah. Now that Deepak is, like, the standard, it's amazing. Kudos to them.
00:44:36.534 - 00:44:42.494, Speaker A: Yeah, they've absolutely nailed it. Um, so some quick fires for you.
00:44:42.834 - 00:44:43.338, Speaker B: Sure.
00:44:43.426 - 00:44:51.014, Speaker A: I've already asked you the first one. Rabio Metamask. I couldn't help myself. Apple or Andrew?
00:44:51.514 - 00:44:52.334, Speaker B: Apple.
00:44:53.794 - 00:44:56.134, Speaker A: Which stable coin do you prefer to hold?
00:44:56.554 - 00:45:03.454, Speaker B: USDC books or audiobooks books, actually, neither.
00:45:04.794 - 00:45:11.636, Speaker A: Books don't do. Learning how many copies my attention span.
00:45:11.660 - 00:45:12.784, Speaker B: Is, like, so bad.
00:45:13.524 - 00:45:16.704, Speaker A: Mine's terrible. Audiobooks on two x speed for me.
00:45:18.804 - 00:45:25.664, Speaker B: Yeah. I used to watch everything on two x. It's like, yeah, I can't walk into that.
00:45:26.044 - 00:45:28.704, Speaker A: Crypto's warped our mind. That's what it is.
00:45:29.124 - 00:45:29.984, Speaker B: Basically.
00:45:31.524 - 00:45:34.284, Speaker A: How many coffees do you drink today, if you do at all?
00:45:34.984 - 00:45:36.404, Speaker B: One, maybe two.
00:45:38.144 - 00:45:41.324, Speaker A: And finally, pineapple and pizza. Yes or no?
00:45:42.184 - 00:45:44.484, Speaker B: I don't mind it, you know, I think it's nice.
00:45:44.984 - 00:45:49.472, Speaker A: I agree. I agree. People need to stop being little bitches about it.
00:45:49.648 - 00:45:55.604, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, salt and sweet has always gone together in, like, history of food cuisine.
00:45:57.504 - 00:46:18.948, Speaker A: I agree. I love it. I don't. I don't get why everyone's a little bitch about it, but they can each of their own. So thank you very much for joining us. And as I say, you're one of the first guests we wanted to reach out for for Stellari is being one of the first guests. And if there's anything you want to leave the listeners with that I might not have asked, being a bad interviewer, please, the floor is yours.
00:46:18.948 - 00:46:30.804, Speaker A: But again, thanks so much for doing this, and I'm glad we've finally been able to sit down, have conversation as well. It's been. Feels like it's been around ten years, even though it might have been two years. No, it's been bumped into each other.
00:46:30.844 - 00:46:32.664, Speaker B: Absolute pleasure. Thank you so much.
00:46:33.614 - 00:46:56.102, Speaker A: Very welcome. Very welcome. So all the links about what we've talked about will be below. I might even do some self shilling on the block myths, trade your articles. There is even a liquidity book tutorial that I sat down and did. So if you want to go and watch it on YouTube, let you go, and if you listen to still early for the first time, please give us a like subscribe. We'll get killed by our editor for not saying this on air.
