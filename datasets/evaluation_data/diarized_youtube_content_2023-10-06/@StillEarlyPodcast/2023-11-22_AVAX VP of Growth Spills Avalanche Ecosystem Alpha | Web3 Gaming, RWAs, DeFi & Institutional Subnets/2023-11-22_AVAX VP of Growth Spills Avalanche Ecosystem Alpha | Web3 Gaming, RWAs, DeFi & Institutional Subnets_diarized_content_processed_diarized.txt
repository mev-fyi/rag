00:00:00.560 - 00:00:43.922, Speaker A: We're also seeing a lot of other players jump in on the stable side and TBD on, like, how that turns out. But it's good to see that this is not, like, a done and dusted market, right? That, like, circle and tether, like, are still being challenged. Like, they're not the defacto winners everywhere. And, you know, like, we were out in Singapore, we've kind of been talking with various. With various organizations and governments on how to create stablecoins, and I think that stable coins are a very real focus area for us. And it's good to know that there's still room for new competitors to pop up in that market.
00:00:43.978 - 00:01:07.418, Speaker B: GM. So just a quick one before we get started. So, still early is podcast for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Any investment decision you should make should be based on your own research and your own understanding of the risks involved. So, yeah, that's it for me. Let's get on with the show. Right.
00:01:07.418 - 00:01:36.814, Speaker B: Take two of episode seven of still early. Dan, that's your fault for not putting on local recordings. But, yeah, we've got over the blip. Apparently, there's a statistic like, episodes five to six of a podcast is usually when people fizzle off. But, yeah, we've been going from strength to strength, and I'm kind of a little bit butthurt that it's going to flip the Blockmates podcast, which I've been, like, stewing over for the past two and a half years, but here we go. And some of you might know this guest as husky. We know him as Garrison, and yeah, we've met recently in Singapore.
00:01:36.814 - 00:01:45.706, Speaker B: I think we're on a similar wavelength when it comes to absolute degeneracy and debauchery. So I'm looking forward to see where this conversation goes. But, sir, how's the jet lag treating you?
00:01:45.850 - 00:01:58.014, Speaker A: Jet lag's good, man. Just came back from Taiwan. Like I was saying earlier, still recovering from that Singapore trip. Maybe we'll share some stories on the pod today. We'll see, see what we can talk about. But it was an absolute blast to the team out there.
00:01:58.174 - 00:02:03.954, Speaker B: Yeah, you must do, you know, get bent out traveling a lot. And, like, particularly when it's conference season.
00:02:04.334 - 00:02:25.092, Speaker A: Uh, you know, I I'm glad that it's calming down. Um, we. We had, like, a wild, wild Asia tour, but there. Nothing beats being on the ground at some of these events. And especially for. For the Asia push this year, I think we kind of realized that these are regions that really value Facetime. They do business differently.
00:02:25.092 - 00:02:53.374, Speaker A: The people on the ground culturally, very different. And the last thing that someone in Korea or Japan want to see is us company comes in to sell you their stuff. They really want to feel like you're investing in the region and that you're meeting their people and you're taking the time to build the community there. I think the few, I say few, maybe four or five months that me and some of the other folks at Eva labs spent going out to these areas. Super tiring, but super well spent, too.
00:02:54.034 - 00:03:13.860, Speaker B: I think it's very much a flip on what you know, from business. I think I was in kind of a biotech kind of sales role prior to banging my head a few times and coming into the industry. And it's very, very transactional, particularly in the west. And, like, it's. It's kind of a bit cutthroat. And this is what we need doing. You're going to pay this for it.
00:03:13.860 - 00:03:32.388, Speaker B: And then you kind of negotiate down over the. Over. Over in the east. I think it's very much a relationship driven, and it's. I know there's like the old adage of people buy from people and stuff like that, but you're completely correct in what you're saying from, like, personal experience. It's. It's very much relationship first and then the rest just kind of gets coaxed in.
00:03:32.388 - 00:03:43.504, Speaker B: But it is a complete flip to the senses if you've only kind of previously been taught that. And it took a kind of while for me to kind of walk to that idea as well. But it's great really, because, you know, it's not 100% transactional in the relationship.
00:03:43.544 - 00:04:28.226, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, I'll be honest, man. Early, early on in the kind of avalanche journey, there was a partnership that, I won't go into details, but there was a partnership that I think we didn't win, so to speak, because we weren't there physically. Now, this is very early on, right, in the journey as a firm. And so as a startup, you're really, you try to be smart about travel, smart about funds. You don't have a ton of people. Right. And so sending someone halfway across the world for a meeting can seem really daunting, but we've realized that, like, that FaceTime is so important, and at some point, we'll have to have some of our regional leads.
00:04:28.226 - 00:04:52.362, Speaker A: Right. We've got a team in India. We've got a team in Japan. We've got a team in Korea. Like these guys and gals operate completely independently of our team. Like, we share a lot of notes, but these guys are building their own communities out in these regions. And they're like, the only reason why we've had so much traction in Asia, right? Cause they're kind of like companies in their own right, as opposed to like, satellite offices of the main company.
00:04:52.498 - 00:05:14.410, Speaker B: And I think you need that as well. Like, can't remember who we were speaking to. I think it was a fund. But one of the. One of the people heading up the fund was just saying, there's so much happening in Asia. And he's like, I've lived around Asia. I think there was an indonesian guy and he was like, there's such a different way that you go about business and business etiquette, even in different kind of countries around, like these.
00:05:14.410 - 00:05:37.160, Speaker B: These pockets, pockets of Asia. And he said, that's kind of our. That's our USP. That's like how we kind of get into these emerging markets. Whereas if you're coming over just a big, big swinging dick with a shitload of money, it's like, doesn't necessarily work like that. And if you can kind of have those inroads, particularly if you're a VC firm, you're fighting for deal flow and stuff like that. And there's going to be so much that comes out of this side of the world, gaming particularly.
00:05:37.160 - 00:06:00.304, Speaker B: Like, it just seems to, like, have such a good pocket of community, particularly Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, like all these places, Korea, like Japan. It just seems like there's something really, really bubbling. And I think you guys having a huge focus over there is just makes a whole lot of sense. Particularly how well set up avalanche is for kind of the game explosion, I think.
00:06:00.844 - 00:06:23.988, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, even China. I mean, I think China is like the 9000 pound elephant in the room. Like, we have a team in China, right? Very, very small team. Completely disconnected from the rest of our company and completely disconnected from the rest of the crypto industry and crypto Twitter, right? So you've got a country in China that use weChat. They're not on Twitter. They don't have Facebook. They don't use Google for the most part.
00:06:23.988 - 00:07:22.974, Speaker A: Right? But then you have arguably one of the biggest economies in the world, and then you talk about gaming and consumerism. We were out there for China, joy. Through some weird back end relationships, we ended up being one of the only crypto firms with a booth on the main floor because they're very dodgy about crypto and the rules are unclear. I was shocked by how many people in China were talking about web3 gaming and avalanche and just crypto at large that we literally never hear of. The chinese community is so segregated from the rest of us and we don't really think about that as an open market. But then you've got companies like, I don't know, Netdragon, right, where you've entire gaming companies that are like, hey, we're not going to focus on any region except China because there's so much money to be made there. And I remember being at this conference and watching people buy stuff and the consumerism there.
00:07:22.974 - 00:07:48.794, Speaker A: Like, we talk about the US and western Europe having strong consumers that are saving the economy. The consumer activity in China is mind boggling. I'm sitting there trying to do the math and I'm like, these guys are selling millions of dollars an hour worth of figurines and collectibles and merch and digital merch. I just go, this is a hotbed for crypto, but we just haven't figured out a way to crack that.
00:07:49.214 - 00:08:25.914, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a total ballgame. And I think a lot of people are probably gonna be slow to react. And I think a lot of, particularly if you're a network or a game and you want to get in the hands of the masses, like if you know, if you're not looking over that side of the world, I think you're being a bit silly, really. But for the uninitiated, kind of, what's, what's your role at Avilabs? Like, give us, give us a high level, give us a bit of self shill. Like how did you get into this kind of role? Is there anything from a past life that's led you to where you are now? Or are you just a company degenerate and landed in one of the best, best roles in crypto?
00:08:26.414 - 00:09:07.560, Speaker A: I mean, I got lucky, right? So I was brought on to run marketing and growth for just the gaming and NFT, like kind of division of Eva Labs. And there's been quite a few personnel changes. And right now I'm running our just all of platform marketing, which includes gaming, defi and nfts and all of that, as well as our comms function. I think over the last couple of years we've kind of moved some pieces around, try to consolidate, try to be like a leaner team. But the last twelve months I've been officially at able labs. Before that I was the CMO of another tech company, VC Bag, Andreessen backed tech company. But I was building games on avalanche.
00:09:07.560 - 00:09:33.834, Speaker A: So you rewind a decade plus, I was a huge gamer. I played professional counter strike. I played professional dota. I played professional Starcraft. And I first got into NFTs and I first got into crypto because of counter strike. There was that whole EsEa scandal where people's computers were being botnetted. And then this whole thing about bitcoin mining came out and I had no idea what it was.
00:09:33.834 - 00:09:42.654, Speaker A: A bunch of us had bitcoin and over the years lost the hardware wallets, didn't know what we did with it. It's just huge shame. I think about it every day.
00:09:43.474 - 00:09:46.202, Speaker B: You could be flying me out first class to wherever you want to go.
00:09:46.298 - 00:10:06.314, Speaker A: I could not be for sure. Oh, my God. Yeah. The amount of people, I don't know if you remember Irc, right? Like, there used to be like, the, like, the chat. The chat thing. The amount of people in IRC that used to bet bitcoin on counter strike matches was insane. People were betting like 500 bitcoin on counter strike matches.
00:10:06.314 - 00:10:37.274, Speaker A: And I, and I kind of think about, like, where those people are today blows my mind. I was a big gamer. I started my career kind of on the product and engineering side. And so over the years, I always wanted to build games. And it wasn't until avalanche, or it wasn't really until like, a couple years ago, right, where web3 gaming and played, earn started taking off. I was like, this is a really cool industry. Like, I can sort of see how, like, esports and collectibles and gaming all can kind of work in this space.
00:10:37.274 - 00:11:15.110, Speaker A: And so I started building games and working with games that just happened to be in the avalanche ecosystem. And then a good buddy of mine who's now the head of gaming at Eva Labs was like, hey, maybe you should come work here instead. And so he pulled me over, and I will never forget when I took the job I walked away from. I was like the first marketer at early stage tech company that became a unicorn. And so I'm kind of, like, looking at this crypto opportunity, right? And I'm like, you know, I've got a lot of equity over here. It's worth, it's worth a lot of money. What's so great about crypto? And, you know, I'm just going to throw ed under the bus.
00:11:15.110 - 00:11:40.134, Speaker A: He's like, dude, you know, is this a huge, good opportunity? Like, it's gaming. All the, all the worst things that happened already, right? Like, you already had, like, the Luna blow up and all that. And at this point, I was like, I was deep in crypto. Like, I was in Cravata, like, luna ust, like loop farming anchor. I was time wonderland. I'm just, I was all over this stuff, right? Defi Summer was fun to me, and I was like, you know what? You're right. Like, it couldn't get anywhere.
00:11:40.134 - 00:12:07.154, Speaker A: So I joined at the beginning of November, and 48 hours later, FTX blew up. Like, literally, I joined Eva labs, and 48 hours later, FTX blew up. And I just remember thinking, like, now it definitely cannot get worse. So there's no point in leaving, right? Like, we're already here. But that's how I landed here. Was, like, big into gaming, built some early games on avalanche, and ended up coming here to run marketing.
00:12:07.694 - 00:12:15.874, Speaker B: You've had a couple of near misses there. Then if you ever, like, try, if you tell me you're going to sell something, just let me know and I'll make sure I purchase it.
00:12:16.574 - 00:13:03.214, Speaker A: I mean, I'll tell you. I think at the end of 2022, right? It was not long ago. I was kind of looking back and I was like, you know, I didn't dodge Luna, I didn't dodge the time Wonderland blow up, but I did dodge FTX, and I dodged FTX only to have all the money that I withdrew from FTX drained because it was an old wallet that I had connected to, like, just some dodgy stuff from defi summer that I never, like, thought about. And I never revoked the permissions. And so I withdrew my entire FTX balance, like, 24 hours before withdrawals got really funky, only to wake up, like, three days later and have nothing in there. Oh, super sad.
00:13:05.554 - 00:13:51.176, Speaker B: You know, when it's. I managed to get out alive of that as well. And then I think Jerry had a funny situation where he was actually borrowing from on FTX, so he was, like, under collateralized borrowing on FDX. So he managed to take money off that technically wasn't his. But, like, he got, he kind of got out alive as well. But the worst ones are when it's your own, like, fault and, you know, you should have just did your basic op tech and, yeah, it's like, it's kind of a rite of passage and you learn not to do it again. But, like, that's what I kind of worry about when I get, I'm starting to get those messages, like, you know, should I be buying something from kind of close friends and family? And because it has been such a minefield, I'm just like, you should probably just buy something if you're not gonna do it full time, you should probably just buy something.
00:13:51.176 - 00:14:26.700, Speaker B: Leave it. I know this is sacrilege to say, but you should just leave it on a coin base or some shit like that. And I know that's really bad to say, but people are gonna really struggle with key management, and particularly if they're gonna start fucking around in Defi, and they're gonna basically run a high percentage chance that they're gonna, gonna lose some funds. But I think there's some quite interesting stuff that's coming online that is trying to mitigate that. And I think, like, the abstraction movement is, is really, really interesting. I'd like to see a little bit more traction from it. I like the idea of kind of mobile first and opt in through social and stuff like that.
00:14:26.700 - 00:14:33.544, Speaker B: But is there anything in that kind of area that's, that you've came across that's in the avalanche ecosystem or maybe even a bit further afield?
00:14:34.524 - 00:15:51.580, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I really think that the account abstraction work is incredible and it's sort of akin to, well, I guess crypto is really funky in the sense that it is probably the only thing that has taken us ten years backwards in user experience, right? We've already had our mobile movement, right? Like you've already had all of Asia sort of leapfrog the west because they're a mobile first, right? Most developing countries are mobile first because they didn't have computers, right, when the Internet was first born. And you have these entire countries and nations that are basically going backwards because they're using web browsers increasingly, because mobile experience for crypto is so shit. And us, we now accept insane friction in the form of poor security. Key management, wallets, really dodgy web, three experiences, permissioning all this is. It's sort of clear and manageable if you understand the industry. But even some of us, we make mistakes sometimes that means the user experience is poor. Something like account abstraction probably should have existed before we built all of these things that people could do, defi and gaming and play to earn.
00:15:51.580 - 00:16:32.614, Speaker A: These are all nuclear weapons. We gave it to people without an instruction manual. Or it's like giving someone a car and saying, hey, go for it, without telling them where the break is. We've recently launched a couple of partnerships with third web, and there's a number of other games that are thinking about wallet management and key management and account abstraction and custodial wallets. In their experience, I think that's going to be key. At the end of the day, I'm unsure of what the web browser for crypto is going to look like. It may just end up being like Chrome and Safari end up incorporating web3 elements.
00:16:32.614 - 00:17:01.870, Speaker A: That's where my head goes, right? Makes wallets obsolete. And we want to think about this anymore, right? Like the whole piece is sort of. It's just early, right? You mentioned gaming and account abstraction. Like, I don't know if you remember like early days of Steam. If you like, rewind back to like 2013. There was an entire black market for Steam accounts because they were so easy to steal. You used to be able, there was an enormous amount of fishers involved on Steam.
00:17:01.870 - 00:17:47.306, Speaker A: They messaged you pretend to be Steam employees. So there was social engineering. But there was also the recovery mechanism was super easy. If someone stole your email or Sim swapped you, you could recover any Steam account. And some of these things have hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of games and items and things on it that really didn't get better until 20 18, 20 19, 20 20. I think about where crypto is, right? We have a bunch of things like two factor, like social logins, like identity management, physical key management, things like that. We're in our third or fourth year of mainstream really looking at this thing and the security will only get better, especially as more users come in.
00:17:47.306 - 00:17:57.814, Speaker A: That's the only way this works is if we provide people who aren't inherently, like, secure and suspicious. Right. With the tools that they need to be safe.
00:17:58.394 - 00:19:08.660, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny, isn't it? Because I think people are so in the weeds with hobbyists and I think the kind of gaming industry falls into that kind of umbrella as well as opposed to like the average kind of retail investor that comes off the street that wants to speculate on something because the Uber drivers told them about something like people who are building in the web3 gaming space, I think they completely understand and get that we better make this as low friction as possible, because one of our competitors is going to make it as low friction as possible and they're going to steal our users. And we're not going to spend tens of millions, if not more, on development for the. For the next five years to then fall out like such a simple hurdle. Whereas in Defi, I think it's because, as you say, we're kind of hobbyists, we're tinkerers, and everyone just accepts that that is the kind of ux. But I think you're looking at things that are coming online. I think the synthetics guys are looking at Infinix and how do we make this as seamless as possible? But I think those that push into and lean really, really heavily into making the UX as simple as possible. I think those are going to come up trumped in the next cycle.
00:19:08.660 - 00:19:10.622, Speaker B: If this is the beginnings of one, I think.
00:19:10.788 - 00:20:01.164, Speaker A: Yeah. And one of the areas where we're really focused, right. This is like a weird way to think about user experience, but it's stable coins. Like, you know, I think about this a lot, right. Is how do I get more users on chain? How do I get more users into avalanche? And how do I get more users to keep some amount of their capital in cryptocurrency? And if you think about it that way, stable coins is a really fantastic answer, because stable coins are the, the user experience is solid, right. You're not storing value in a cryptocurrency that you're unfamiliar with, where there might be, you might not be familiar with the volatility, you may not be comfortable with the volatility. And so even if you create a way for a user to easily buy avax, eth, bitcoin, whatever, on chain, the volatility alone might check them out, right.
00:20:01.164 - 00:21:17.494, Speaker A: And so one of the things that the avalanche ecosystem has been really focused on is building an ecosystem of stable coins, maybe even something like akin to a forex market, because people just feel comfortable having access to digital dollars and digital yuan and digital singaporean dollar, digital cad, whatever it is, they're comfortable holding their own currency in a digital form. Especially when you've got a player like circle reputable compliant guarantees one for one back in the the related fiat. And I really do think that the more we do to build and support an ecosystem around stablecoins, the more people are going to jump in and be willing to try it. Right now, because of where the market is, the value proposition of stable coins and the yield that you get for holding stable coins on chain, it's marginally better than government treasuries. But that will change. That will change in the next twelve to 24 months. If we can create products on ramps, off ramps around stable coins, if we can create things to do with your stablecoins, I think we're going to see a lot of people come in and play around with it, at least with some percentage of the money that they use to speculate, invest, or just save.
00:21:17.954 - 00:21:45.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's such an obvious one. And even going back to, I don't know, bitcoin white paper electronic cash bid appear, it. It feels like it was so overlooked and kind of came as a. As a. As an afterthought or kind of a bit further downstream of what actually happened in from Defi summer. But now it's kind of coming full circle. And man, if you could have.
00:21:45.454 - 00:22:26.098, Speaker B: I know, like, defi maxis will be kind of completely against this, but circle tether, those guys have got such a good business. And like, the upside of what that actually could be is quite scary, to be honest. But it's such a simple and effective product. And you even see UK government now considering stablecoins as an optional payment, like an actually regulated payment method. And it just seems like everyone's slowly warming up to the fact that this could actually be. Because one of my friends is, he's based out in Asia himself, he's got a business. A lot of people in the US want to send him crypto.
00:22:26.098 - 00:22:47.254, Speaker B: He doesn't have, he doesn't have a clear out. Accept it. And I was like, this is how you do this, how you do it. You'd see the confusion, like the horror in his eyes. When I was expecting something, I was like, look, trust me, when you do it three or four times and you realize you can just send an address, you don't have to wait over the weekend to receive it. It's going to be in dollars. You're not going to have any volatility or fluctuations in price.
00:22:47.254 - 00:22:56.292, Speaker B: And then like, as soon as people do it for a couple of times, they realize, shit, this is actually, this is a million times better. But yeah, it is.
00:22:56.468 - 00:24:00.514, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I, you know, I think, I think USDT, I think tether and circle, right? Like, there's very valid criticisms of how they operate. They've been super successful. And if they've been able to be successful, like, in this environment this early, it just goes to show what people are after, right? If you go to, you know, I think, I think in the us, I think, you know, Western Europe, like, these are, these are countries that have like really functional financial systems, right? Especially the US, right? Petro dollar, everything's valued against the us dollar. But you go to a lot of other countries, and I'm not talking about just like developing nations. If you were in Japan for the last twelve months, you probably wanted easy access to us dollars, right? I mean, the yen is like a 153. And most people just want an easy way to access digital currency and not be forced to store value in their local currency while also being able to optionally transact, right, and off ramp into their local currency if they need to buy things.
00:24:00.514 - 00:24:42.256, Speaker A: And it's really the optionality that people want. And the system today just doesn't totally support that. But I was just in Taiwan and you're able to go to ATM and you're able to withdraw the local currency by depositing tether. So I think we're already seeing some of. We're already seeing some of these countries in some of these areas start to adopt and the product market fit is amazing. And I think that sometimes we jump into the hyper financialized products. How do you get structured products on chain? How do you create? You have all these defi Ponzis, but then you also have like these borrowing lending protocols.
00:24:42.256 - 00:25:03.496, Speaker A: I think sometimes we forget that most people just kind of want really easy access to digital stables, right. Us dollars primarily, but also you got Euroseed, all these other currencies that. That people may want access to and they just want to be able to send, retrieve, receive, store in a really easy way. And if we can solve like the base need, everything else can be built on top of it.
00:25:03.640 - 00:25:11.632, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you know anything about this USDV, the verified USD? I've seen it come across. I think blue from Trader Joe might shared. Shared it last night as a new.
00:25:11.728 - 00:25:38.874, Speaker A: It's super new. I actually just popped on my radar this morning. I've got a bunch of reading to do on it, but it seems super interesting. And I think that we're also seeing a lot of other players jump in on the stable side and TBD on like, how that turns out. But it's good to see that this is not like a dun and dusted market, right. That circle and tether are still being challenged. Like, they're not the de facto winners everywhere.
00:25:38.874 - 00:26:05.854, Speaker A: And, you know, like we were out in Singapore, we've kind of been talking with various. With various organizations and governments on like, how to create stable coins. And I think that, you know, I think that stable coins are a very real focus area for us and it's good to. It's good to know that there's still room, right. For new competitors to pop up in that market.
00:26:06.674 - 00:26:45.346, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you think stablecoins standardization occurs? Because I know across every network there's going to be whoever's the bridging provider, whoever's basically primarily the bridging provider everyone's budding for. Do we have XLR USDC? Do we have just have native USDC from circle? That issue of fragmenting a little bit of liquidity across these different wrappers of stablecoins, how do you think about that? And is there any kind of internal discussions that you've got going on at Ava labs or is it not something that you've thought about?
00:26:45.530 - 00:27:30.278, Speaker A: It's really tricky. The fragmented ecosystems and fragmented liquidity issue, I think, is going to continue to happen because, let's face it, there's a lot of incentive for people to launch layer one, L2s, right? Like, it's a really, it's a really good way for people to create value. And because there's a financial incentive there, we're going to continue to see it happen. Right. I think in my mind, when I, when I think about Eva Lab's position on that, I think we ultimately feel like it is a multi chain future, right? Not just within the avalanche network. Ethereum is not going anywhere. Bitcoin is not going anywhere.
00:27:30.278 - 00:28:01.126, Speaker A: Arguably, ecosystems like Solana are not going anywhere. And we think that there's going to be a certain set of activities that are right for each ecosystem. I think about Ethereum. Super high security. You don't need speed, you don't need cost effective transactions, especially if you're sending large amounts. Then the fee to value ratio makes a ton of sense. Ethereum will probably exist as a place for really large transactions.
00:28:01.126 - 00:28:28.794, Speaker A: And the types of organizations and companies that need to have security, it will always exist to serve them. You've got Solana. The user experience is amazing. They've really, really done a great job connecting on the payment side and with individual users. Right. On the consumer side or retail side. Again, if you need a chain that's fast and feels fast, they're always going to be a really great solution.
00:28:28.794 - 00:29:23.426, Speaker A: Something like avalanche. We've always existed to be a chain of chains. And we think about a future where we're creating a ton of chains, specifically on the enterprise b, two b institution gaming, being a subset of enterprise. And we'll ultimately solve that bridging and fragmented liquidity problem with subnet to subnet communication, right? Like, within the avalanche network, you have a bunch of chains that inherently can recognize and mirror the assets on another chain through avalanche warp messaging. And I think, obviously, I would love to see a world where, like, we support, you know, we do have avalanche rust. Like, I'd love to see a world where, like, Solana operates on a subnet, right. For a lot of reasons like that, that may or may not happen, but the more we have cross chain communication, the better off the user experience is going to be.
00:29:23.426 - 00:30:11.574, Speaker A: We're going to solve a lot of these fragmented liquidity problems. Bridges should really be a kind of last resort type of motion. If you needed to bridge between ecosystems where you don't have something like circles, cross chain product, where you can have native USDC on multiple chains, that being said, if we're talking about stablecoins, I do think that stablecoins are a winner takes all market and inevitably the largest couple of players will probably support native assets across the chains where there are the most users. I don't think that there is a world where circle would not at the very least support chains like ethereum, avalanche, Solana, you know, your top, your top five by kind of users and activity.
00:30:11.914 - 00:31:00.074, Speaker B: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. So, you know, you said you had a couple of near misses coming into Yale career, leaving a tech unicorn, and then obviously you came to Ava labs. Then two days later, FTX collapses. But do you kind of feel like the beginnings of being vindicated now? Do you feel like, because it's a very attention driven space, people are getting dragged from shiny object to shiny object, but over the last, I'd say maybe six to eight weeks, and I might be a little bit closer to this than like the average kind of user in the space. But do you feel like the beginnings of people beginning to kind of come back and be like, yeah, why were we sleeping on this for kind of so long? Do you feel like that's happening? Because I definitely see it happening.
00:31:00.574 - 00:31:31.034, Speaker A: I definitely do. I mean, I always joke that, like, I have two jobs, right? My one job is really long term. It's my job to make sure that we're doing the things that are going to help us win and become a real functioning business over the next ten years. Because the truth is that no layer one, L2 ecosystem has really figured out a business model that's sustainable and is going to support mass adoption. But that's the target. We're all trying to figure out what it's going to look like. We're trying to figure out what it's going to be.
00:31:31.034 - 00:32:16.994, Speaker A: So that's on one side. And you know that we've got our enterprise b two B business. Ava Labs has, Ava cloud Avalanche has this infrastructure as a service type model. And I think that that b two B mode of providing blockchain infrastructure is a really good long term bet. On the other hand, I have to make sure that we stay relevant right across all of these different cycles. And so all the things that people are really excited about right now, we've just come off a really great week where the tech is getting better, people are really excited, and we don't know what the macro looks like. We don't know how long this is going to last, but it's important that we have things like Stars arena, even though that has its fair share of drama.
00:32:16.994 - 00:32:59.416, Speaker A: It's good that we have hype around web3 gaming in the short term. People need to understand that this is still relevant. Right? Like, yes, there's a long term vision that's not going to come to fruition for however many years, but there are really exciting things to tinker with and play with and experiment with right now. And I do feel like we're just beginning to see the validation of our very big enterprise. Bet. Avalanche has bet more on b two B and then consumer via those b two B businesses than most chains. But the trade off is that you don't focus as much on retail.
00:32:59.416 - 00:33:34.270, Speaker A: Right. And so a lot of our belief is you're going to have companies like shrapnel and companies like SK and Dreamus, which is like the Ticketmaster in Korea. Right. These companies will bring millions of users because they have consumer applications, whether it's a game or a mobile app or whatever that people are using. And they're going to put that in the Avalanche network. And when you think about something like a shrapnel, right, aaa game, you know, counter strike does a few billion dollars a year. Shrapnel might be like a more like mid market size shooter, I'm not sure.
00:33:34.270 - 00:34:06.872, Speaker A: Right. But let's say, like, shrapnel creates, you know, $100 million a year revenue. Right. Some of that value stays on chain as value in the network. And that's how you grow network value because you have these multiple products across various industries that consumers are spending money on that then generate and store value because they're selling consumers things. Crypto is not magical in the sense that we can constantly spin value out of nothing. The more we have these products that drive revenue, and some of that revenue goes to the business.
00:34:06.872 - 00:34:14.288, Speaker A: Some of that revenue stays on chain. The more we can create really sustainable network value that doesn't just disappear cycle after cycle.
00:34:14.456 - 00:34:36.184, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's a kind of self fulfilling prophecy slash flywheel. If, like, the likes of shrapnel does go on to do something great, which I've kind of got my opinion on that, and I think it's probably one of the games that we've all been waiting for for such a long time in the industry. And then they see that. They see that as a blueprint or they did it on avalanche. Right. So we should do that.
00:34:36.184 - 00:34:52.426, Speaker B: Let's fund a load of stuff to happen over on avalanche. And then it just, like, the cycle just continues and then something else sticks, and that brings in an additional 50% on top of what shrapnel brought in, and then you can just see how the network effects of that will happen. It's glaringly obvious.
00:34:52.530 - 00:35:46.720, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly right. I mean, I think that liquidity, the wonderful thing about crypto is that switching costs are very low. Right? Like we talked about bridging earlier, it's a pain in the ass. But, like, look, if I wanted to move all of my assets from avalanche to ethereum or Ethereum to polygon or polygon to slot whatever, like, it's actually not that difficult, right? And the switching cost is not that high. And so this whole idea of, like, captured liquidity today is like, right, like, we can spend a lot of money trying to incentivize liquidity to come on chain, but it's all just like, not very sticky. But if people come for a product like shrapnel, right, then the users are retained because they like the product, not because there's financial incentive, and that value stays on chain is very sticky. And if you run a b two b playbook where we ultimately believe we're going to win on the tech side, we're going to win on a practical tech side.
00:35:46.720 - 00:36:04.294, Speaker A: This stuff is usable. It's usable. AWS is usable. It's usable. Redshift is usable. Where you can just go and buy a product and integrate it into your product, you get to place a ton of bets. We bet on shrapnel, we bet on Godzilla, we bet on move, we bet on blitz.
00:36:04.294 - 00:36:46.294, Speaker A: A lot of games, but we bet on Dreamus and SKP. If any one of these businesses blow up, become multimillion or multi hundred or multibillion dollar businesses that value accrues to the network. And it is easier and more sustainable to bet on that than try to drag retail liquidity in through incentives, I think that will ultimately work. Um, that's sort of like the route that, that we decided to go. But like many other ecosystems, like, we got to land that plane right there. There still is no mass consumer business that uses blockchain and generates revenue consistently. There just isn't one.
00:36:46.294 - 00:37:00.264, Speaker A: You've got a lot of really great revenue generating businesses on chain, like GMX comes to mind. Right. Um, but your average consumer is not using that product. And so it's got limited tam and limited scale today.
00:37:01.364 - 00:37:41.132, Speaker B: So I think the way, and I think it's a part of where we are in the cycle where I think that strategy is 100% correct. And I think there's a lot more moving parts where, like, if we think back to avalanche rush, the industry was absolutely flying. There was new people coming in every single day. It made sense to then go and do an incentives program on chain people because there was such a budding Defi ecosystem getting built over there. And there was like unique products where when you got over there, you were only going to be able to use that product on avalanche. So you had that kind of stickiness and retention of users who were there at the time. And it made sense because you got a lot of eyes on, you've got new people coming in.
00:37:41.132 - 00:38:07.562, Speaker B: Not a huge amount of competition, particularly if you went to a lot of other chains and try to use them. And it was a bit of, a, bit of a nightmare and a bit of a shit show. I bridged to some ungodly chains, like there's some receipts of my bridging places. But now I think you've used that. That's a great customer acquisition cost and channel. You've used that, such a Trojan horse. Vast majority of people have used avalanche, who is still around now.
00:38:07.562 - 00:38:32.534, Speaker B: And now it's like business focus. How do we get stuff where the masses are going to want to use it? And then you kind of lean into the kind of business focus, then build it first and then they will come. And the vast majority of people, as I say, who've stuck around from that first cycle, they're going to be over there. They're going to draw attention. They're going to want people to have a look at, come see what I've got. Can you buy it off me for a higher price? The whole thing's going to happen.
00:38:33.074 - 00:38:35.146, Speaker A: I love some speculation, right? Yeah.
00:38:35.170 - 00:38:37.174, Speaker B: Well, who doesn't? That's why we're here.
00:38:37.514 - 00:39:12.752, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I think about it this way, right? There was this recent report that came out that said that there are like billions of dollars stored in Venmo accounts. Because people just like, you know, like, I've got a couple hundred dollars there. You got a couple hundred dollars there. We just store it in like cash app and memo and all that, right? And I think nowadays they give you like a very small like yield on it because rates are up. But imagine if you could like buy jpegs or speculate on things, right, with your Venmo balance. Like people will always have a certain amount of money that they are willing to go and use on these types of things.
00:39:12.752 - 00:39:43.720, Speaker A: And I think about our ecosystem kind of like that, right? What we really want is to have a series of products that people use, right, that are valuable to their everyday lives, not money that they're speculating with. But it's just, it's just their, it's just their value, right? Their money. And that can be a game. That can be a financial product. It can be that they're collecting something on chain. It could be loyalty points, it could be e commerce, whatever it is, right? Avalanche. And the businesses that we support with our infrastructure are part of your lives.
00:39:43.720 - 00:40:29.568, Speaker A: Like Venmo is part of your lives. And so you have some value on chain. And because you have value and because there's liquidity in the network, because everyone has some value on chain, people will build products like stars arena, people will build products like NFT projects. People will build products like meme coins, right? And they'll build it because you and I have some money on chain that most of it is for this other purpose. But hey, like maybe we carve out a little bit to go play in the meme coin casino or to buy some nfts. And that's what drives a hyper sustainable ecosystem. To date, most crypto ecosystems have been the opposite, right? Like we start with meme coins and nfts and other casino speculative type projects, and people try to bootstrap a ton of liquidity through those to go build the real products.
00:40:29.568 - 00:40:50.194, Speaker A: And so far, I mean, there's some really good, really good projects, but no one's really landed that plane in a way. Like, most people don't use GMX every day. Right. Unfortunately, we don't have that killer product that everyone uses all the time. That's going to drive a ton of liquidity in and keep it there.
00:40:54.174 - 00:41:17.606, Speaker B: Do you think we might see it? I know we've seen stars arena for NTRC and I think there's something like Blackbird for reservations and all that kind of stuff. Do you think we see a bit of a wave of consumer apps that are a bit of a Trojan horse to get people to use something that they don't understand that on the back end that is running on like, blockchain technology to think like, is there anything that you're seeing on your, your side defense where that could be a possibility.
00:41:17.710 - 00:41:18.998, Speaker A: Thing is already there?
00:41:19.166 - 00:41:19.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:19.534 - 00:41:55.008, Speaker A: Yeah, it's already there. And you know, the shitty thing about, like, global businesses is like, I, the US just doesn't really care, like, what's going on in some other country sometimes. Like, we just don't because we don't connect with it, right. It's kind of like, you know, if we brought grab, if we put grab on chain, everyone in the US would be like, what is this? Because it's not Uber. It's not Uber eats. So we. So we've been working with a company in Korea called SkPlanet, and they're a really good partner in this early stage because unlike the US, where you have, like, you know, Ticketmaster, and if you want to work with Ticketmaster, then you're going to go talk to, like, AEG, because they run the.
00:41:55.008 - 00:42:49.904, Speaker A: They run the stadiums, and you're going to go talk the record label, right? Because they're all these interconnected, connected companies. In Korea, you've got one conglomerate that owns everything, right? They own the record labels, they own the stadiums, they own the ticketing business, right? And so we work with them because they have this or one of the companies that we work with there is called Dreamus. It's effectively the ticketmaster of Korea, right? They also own a bunch of record labels for a bunch of big K pop stars, and they've already put ticket issuance on chain, and they've done hundreds of thousands of tickets already since this launch two months ago. And the people who use this product have no idea that they're getting issued tickets on chain. So eventually, when the marketplace, which is like a secondary ticket master marketplace, launches, all that will be on chain, and you get all the benefits of having on chain ticketing, right? Like, it's impossible to counterfeit. It's hard to scalp. You could have programmable rules where you can't transfer tickets, whatever.
00:42:49.904 - 00:43:53.200, Speaker A: It's really nice that way. And you've got millions of korean people who are buying k pop tickets at music festivals. They have no idea that it's on chain. So when it eventually converts on chain and all that value starts accruing into an on chain product, that's going to be really great for the network. And it's these kinds of things that I'm really excited about, because if you know that the product you're using is speculative, you're already thinking about when you're pulling your value out of it, right? So that capital is, like, really difficult to store. And because most speculative products don't yield any value except for speculative value, you don't get that smooth, consistent curve of revenue growth. You know what I'm saying? Right? Like, I'm not going to use the word ponzi because they're not all Ponzis, but, you know, if you have something where the primary value to the user is speculative as opposed to a product or service that's provided that liquidity is always really, like, unsticky and with those.
00:43:53.232 - 00:44:32.478, Speaker B: Tickets is they're kind of native royalty baked in if they want. Because a big issue with ticketing is tout. Right. And if you imagine if you play it out to the most extreme end of the spectrum, like Taylor Swift, tickets might go for 100 x what they got being able to snipe them on Ticketmaster or some shit. But if it's like ticketing is ripe for having a royalty based system baked in and people do when I go and sell them on the secondary, it actually, you're going to have kickback to the actual creator or whoever's actually distributing the tickets, the publisher or the agency. Is that a function of that?
00:44:32.646 - 00:45:19.462, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all on the table. I think what I like about what SKPlanet has been doing is they've been mirroring the existing customer experience as closely as possible on chain so that the user base doesn't have to, they don't have to adopt a new product. To them, it's always been the same thing. Eventually when some of these features come out, they'll just get baked into the consumer app that the person already uses. Dreamus is, or it's actually done through an app called Okcashbag, but, ok, Cashback is an app that already exists on 100 billion phones. And so far, I think it's like a percentage or two of those users have opted into the on chain product and created a wallet on this subnet. And so they know that they're opting into a web3 product, but most people don't.
00:45:19.462 - 00:45:59.830, Speaker A: And so as these web3 products roll out, they'll still get to access them, like whether it's royalties or secondary marketplace or something like that. But users won't have to adopt a new thing. So I do think all this stuff is on the table, but I like the way that they're doing it because they're going to bring in the users first and then start to chuck on chain features at them. There's another business in gaming that's doing this. TSM, which is an esports team that has pivoted into really focusing on tech and consumer products. Their blitz app, 8 million monthly actives, maybe close to 10 million monthly actives, 30 million total users. They've already integrated CS two and League of Legends as their most popular teamfight tactics.
00:45:59.830 - 00:46:41.808, Speaker A: Apex Valorant like this is an app that when it launches on Avalanche, at first it's really just going to be an on chain subscription. It'll be on chain subscription. You can pay with cryptocurrency, and eventually you'll have on chain tournament records and esports and prizes. And it's just going to be really. And the nice thing is people buy and sell in game items. And so I was talking earlier about how having value in game, right, or having value on chain, people just have like 1020, $3100 in their blitz account because they might need to buy some stuff with it. Once it's on chain, all that value in that product accrues on the Avalanche network.
00:46:41.808 - 00:46:55.674, Speaker A: That becomes network value. Right. And I think that that's a really great way to build an ecosystem because you have a product that people want to use and want to keep money in that creates value for them outside of speculative value.
00:46:56.774 - 00:47:31.172, Speaker B: I'm so bullish on, like, whoever can capture the and just use it as a Trojan horse and then, like, slowly drip feeds kind of the benefits of what we see from on chain transactions to the users. And then I think that's the way to do it. I don't think it's like crypto first. I don't think you go down that route. I don't think you go down, like, the crypto first route. I think you really do give them something that they're very, very familiar with and then slowly start drip feeding them different utility and different use cases and different kind of features and do it that way. And then it's like, by the end of it, it's like the.
00:47:31.172 - 00:47:41.664, Speaker B: What is it? What's the, like, the frog in boiling water analogy? Like, if you chuck him in boiling water, it'll just jump out. But if you slowly turn the heat up over time, like it wouldn't realize it was getting boiled alive.
00:47:42.204 - 00:48:15.074, Speaker A: I mean, I think that the major mistake that we've made, and maybe not mistake, but the kind of misstep that the industry has made so far is that crypto is an industry. And crypto projects and apps and things that you can do on chain are really geared towards people with a lot of money. Right. If you have a lot of liquidity, you have access to do more things on chain than your average user. Right. And you stand to benefit from things more than your average user if you have a lot of liquidity. Things like farming.
00:48:15.074 - 00:49:09.494, Speaker A: Right. Yield farming way more valuable. If you have a lot of liquidity, you can invest in certain on chain products, you can do certain things in Defi, and it's just going to be the product market fit is better, right. But the promise of crypto was always to be a set of products or an ecosystem that was hyper valuable to the majority, not the minority. And so all these products that are finding ways to get you know, a buck or two from 5 billion people. Those things are going to help us be more successful than the things that are, like, really geared towards, you know, again, social fi right now as it exists, defi as it exists right now. Like, generally speaking, if you don't have a lot of liquidity on chain, it's kind of useless, right? And if the actual value prop is like capital, efficiency, and speculation and yield, like, those things are always going to be.
00:49:09.494 - 00:49:33.164, Speaker A: Those things are always for people who have a ton of liquidity, and it's a turn off for people who don't. And we're never going to be able to get those people on chain unless we think about this a little bit differently. That's why gaming is so exciting. You have an industry where people are already geared to, unfortunately, lose money. Gamers just spend money and lose money. We don't expect anything out of it. And you get a ton of value even when you are losing money.
00:49:33.164 - 00:50:03.752, Speaker A: You spend money on items in games, subscription, you buy games and you're happy because you get this entertainment value out of it. And so gaming is such a great way for us to bring people on chain, because they're not here to make money, but they're willing to put money into it. And that's a really different set of behaviors and expectation than most crypto users who are willing to put money in. But their goal is to extract more out of it. Yeah, yeah. Their goal is to extract more. And, and when they.
00:50:03.752 - 00:50:14.484, Speaker A: When they do extract more, the ecosystem loses. And when they don't extract more, they leave. They churn. Right. And so it's. It's like lose lose over here, but gaming is super win win.
00:50:15.264 - 00:50:40.984, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I know we're getting to the top of the hour, so I don't want to take up too much more of your time, but I have some quick fires if you'll entertain me. All right, let me just find them where they are. So I asked Coop some of the same ones, but I've added one or two more in here. So because of the success of avalanche crocs. Sport mode or relaxed mode?
00:50:41.364 - 00:50:43.744, Speaker A: Sport mode. All day long, you gotta move fast.
00:50:46.764 - 00:50:48.224, Speaker B: PlayStation or Xbox?
00:50:48.564 - 00:50:52.624, Speaker A: PlayStation. Kingdom hearts, man. Like a kingdom hearts.
00:50:52.944 - 00:50:54.804, Speaker B: Call of Duty four. Call of Duty five.
00:50:55.424 - 00:50:56.564, Speaker A: Call of Duty five.
00:50:57.664 - 00:51:06.272, Speaker B: Prepared crypto wallet. And we obviously take core as your primary prime answer here. But aside from core, if I had.
00:51:06.288 - 00:51:08.244, Speaker A: To pick a wallet besides core, I'd pick Phantom.
00:51:09.064 - 00:51:12.408, Speaker B: Good answer. Phantom's so sick. Apple or Android?
00:51:12.496 - 00:51:20.970, Speaker A: Although. Although I will say honorable mention for Robbie, Robbie's a great wolf wallet man.
00:51:21.002 - 00:51:34.074, Speaker B: I keep finding like absolutely vaporware in random wallets because Rabi lets you kind of find all the wallets that are linked to your private key. And there's some absolutely horrendous vaporware tokens in those wallets.
00:51:34.114 - 00:51:50.422, Speaker A: Oh my gosh. I had like the dumbest nfts. I actually spent. I spent a whole day sending a bunch of these nfts to like the burn address because I just couldn't stand to see them anymore. Like, I looked at them and I just like, I think, oh my gosh, like, what was I thinking?
00:51:50.598 - 00:51:57.514, Speaker B: You should send them to like a public account that, you know, that's their wallet and just like plague them with your horrendous bad decisions.
