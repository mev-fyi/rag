00:00:00.600 - 00:00:19.526, Speaker A: We haven't seen well on the enterprise side. Like, I think that's what you're talking about, institutional side. I don't think an l two is going to be appealing. You know, they need to buy and burn eth. You know, the WeWork example is a really good example. Like, these apps already have product markets fit. Like, they don't need your security.
00:00:19.526 - 00:00:33.910, Speaker A: They have more security than you potentially. So, like, they don't care about that. What they do care about is I'm like, hey, how can I build a stable architecture and stable blockchain fast and subnets? Great example, GM.
00:00:33.942 - 00:00:59.974, Speaker B: So just a quick one before we get started. So still early is a podcast for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Any investment decision you should make should be based on your own research and your own understanding of the risks involved. So, yeah, that's it for me. Let's get on with the show. Alright. Welcome back to another episode of still early today.
00:00:59.974 - 00:01:05.594, Speaker B: We're joined by the one and only Luigi from Avilabs. So how are you doing? Thanks so much for jumping on.
00:01:05.894 - 00:01:13.022, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for having me. I'm doing quite well. Happy to be here. I know we've been planning this for a minute, so get up on here.
00:01:13.198 - 00:01:27.634, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's so much going on over your neck of the woods, so I'm finally glad we got to nail it down. There's a million more things we want to get into, but, yeah. How have you been the past couple of weeks? It's all been going on on your end.
00:01:29.174 - 00:02:07.934, Speaker A: So we're recording this middle of October. I don't know when it drops, but it's been a pretty crazy few weeks for me, to say the least. Obviously the stars arena stuff was thrilling, exhausting at the same time, and sort of picking up the pieces of all that and seeing how we could help. Support was definitely something that was definitely something that required a lot of time, a lot of patience. And so, yeah, I'm good now, I'm feeling better now. But it was, it was a crazy few weeks. I was actually traveling, I was in, I was at ETH Milan conference during the whole fiasco.
00:02:07.934 - 00:02:11.974, Speaker A: So it's a funny story about that, but we can get into that whenever.
00:02:13.274 - 00:02:51.540, Speaker B: You keep getting some sleep. And yeah, I've got a. Got a lot of questions around this because it's kind of took the full industry by storm, which is really impressive to see. So I'm sure we'll get into that in a minute, but why don't we take it a step back a little bit before we go full for all and go forward. So how have you came to be in this position? You are at Ava Labs? Was there any kind of. I know there isn't a traditional background to work in this industry. There's some kind of loosely adjacently corresponding industries that might lend itself well to working in this weird and wonderful world, but is there any kind of, like, interesting backstory that's led you to where you are now?
00:02:51.612 - 00:03:32.912, Speaker A: It's a good question. Yeah, I mean, I could give my, I guess, my brief background on my story. So there's always a finance sort of major out of school. First job out of school was at Citigroup. I was there for about six years or so in a number of different capacities. I traded credit instruments and equities and handled a bunch of different stuff initially in my career on the middle office side of things, because I actually graduated right after the crisis. So not a great time to graduate with a finance degree, but, like, got kind of exhausted by, quote, unquote, working on Wall street, so to speak.
00:03:32.912 - 00:04:09.524, Speaker A: It was very taxing on the body and the mind in a lot of ways. You know, I was very interested in crypto since, like, 2011, mainly bitcoin. I remember sitting on one of the desks and talking to one of the. One of my colleagues about bitcoin when I saw the white paper. And just like, being amazed by it, I bought it immediately and then sold it when Apple Pay came out, thinking that the whole thesis was over. So, you know, I revisited a number of times after that, but that was the initial foray. And then one of my really good friends told me about Ethereum, I think, in like, 2015 or so.
00:04:09.524 - 00:04:47.626, Speaker A: And I started attending a lot of the eth meetups. I was really fascinated by the potential of what we could build on something like EVM. And I actually started my own sort of startup in the crypto space back in like, it was 2017. We were building, funny enough, something like a social fi type of application, and we're actually building it on our chain using Rolang. So for anybody who's been around for a minute, that'll tickle some senses. And did that for a few years. And that's really where I think I learned a lot about number one, blockchain infrastructure.
00:04:47.626 - 00:05:05.794, Speaker A: Two, tokenomics. I just went down every single rabbit hole in the space at that time. And there was no real infrastructure, there was no uniswap. There weren't any oracles. There was nothing, like, to work with at the time. And so you really had to build a bare bones. You build everything bare bones from the start.
00:05:05.794 - 00:05:58.694, Speaker A: So just given my background with finance product in the crypto space and understanding a lot of the different elements, it's also scalable blockchains. When Defi came around, I was obviously very interested in it and engaged and also was probably one of the early people participating in Defi as a whole. And then when Avalanche was looking for somebody to come in and sort of spearhead that operation, that was something I was very interested in doing. Came in and did that about a little over two and a half years ago. Now I'm with the firm, so mainly leading our Defi operations. I had a lot to do with something like Avalanche Rush and then now also took over our Devrel sort of operations earlier in the year. And, yeah, it's been a fun ride.
00:05:58.694 - 00:06:12.002, Speaker A: Not for somebody who likes to sleep or likes to relax. But with that said, very rewarding, very exciting and I really enjoyed it.
00:06:12.178 - 00:06:14.654, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't imagine any two days are the same.
00:06:15.054 - 00:06:46.136, Speaker A: They're not, no. And, you know, it's like you could sort of feel things bubbling up sometimes, like, you know, something's gonna happen soon. Something's gonna happen since whether it's good or bad, you never know. And just kind of take everything astride that, you know, I have a great team. I love, you know, the people I work with. And we've got, we've got a great community, too. So it's been, it's been fun to watch sort of this really cool story of avalanche developed since I've been here, even from the beginning.
00:06:46.136 - 00:06:52.244, Speaker A: And, you know, I think it's got a lot to offer and, yeah, I'm really enjoying myself.
00:06:53.104 - 00:07:22.878, Speaker B: Yeah, we touched upon it a little bit there with avalanche rush. Like I always say, if you could drop me back into any point in time of my complete degenerate career, that would be, it was literally the best time to be on chain. I don't care what anyone says. It was every, like, as you say, no sleep at all. There was so much shit happening all at once. It was like, incredible. And what was it like from the inside when all that was going on? Because there was just like a hive of activity.
00:07:22.878 - 00:07:31.006, Speaker B: It captured everyone's mind share and attention and, you know, did you, did you expect it to be as big and as successful as it initially was?
00:07:31.110 - 00:08:13.170, Speaker A: It's a good question. I got hired, I think, in, like, it was April. And we dropped the program, like, announced it officially in August. We had it ready for a while. If whoever doesn't remember we had aave curve sushi, all these guys coming over and we sort of, I think, did a really good job of bringing attention to the chain. And the overall goal of avalanche rush was pretty simple. I don't know if anybody remembers, but pre l two s, like having fast finality on the EVM was very cool because using Ethereum mainnet was pretty slow.
00:08:13.170 - 00:09:04.706, Speaker A: Like, submit a transaction, you know, go grips, three sips of your coffee, maybe another five, and then you're like, oh, for the love of God. You know, it's. And so with this, it was like, hey, let's show everybody, you know, let's use this as a way to show everybody what avalanche consensus can do for the ux of using a blockchain. That was one of the ideas, obviously, notwithstanding building the defi ecosystem, liquidity, all these other things as well. And that was like, at the same time, we also deployed our bridge, which at that time was like best in class in UX. And I think the combination of that experience and that integrated experience in a lot of ways really made people excited. A lot of people have dropped different types of programs before, but they haven't gotten traction because the program in and itself isn't what gains traction.
00:09:04.706 - 00:09:29.944, Speaker A: It's like a combination of multiple factors. So we had, you know, Benki was already live with its own incentive program. You know, we had the promise of a future incentive program. We had great Ux in terms of the chain as well as the bridge. And like, everybody came and was just like, okay, wow, like, let's build on this thing. And so they did. And, you know, I guess we had a really good sense that it was going to make noise.
00:09:29.944 - 00:10:02.346, Speaker A: I don't think I had an idea that it was going to like, you know, take off like that. I mean, my life changed after that program was announced. In a lot of ways. It was funny. I don't know how many people remember this, but there was this one month, maybe a little bit longer of a one month period after avalanche rush was announced from when Aave actually deployed where, like, my life was not fun. I just got, I got absolutely crushed by everybody on a day in and day basis. I actually told funny story.
00:10:02.346 - 00:10:37.194, Speaker A: I told the stars arena guys, like last week, I was like, listen, you know, everybody's gonna come like, you know, to your doorstep and with pitchforks every day that the thing's not live, but like, once it's live and it's working, nobody's gonna remember that one week time that it was down and they won't really remember it. And that was, you know, from the experience that I had, but magnified times five and, you know, I think a little bit more public at the time. So just some, just some lessons along the way. You know, you have to be steadfast in the way you're thinking and just kind of, you know, be a big boy in a lot of ways, be able to handle stuff.
00:10:37.574 - 00:11:21.398, Speaker B: Yeah. How difficult is user and developer acquisition in such a short attention span industry that we, that we work in? Because obviously, like incentive programs around what you guys did with Rush have definitely had a positive impact on the, on the ecosystem. I've seen others try and do it and just because they're giving out incentives, there's been no retention or no kind of stickiness there. So, like how getting a user over is one thing, but again, if you're heading up developer relations as well, how hard is it to get great builders to be building in a specific ecosystem as well?
00:11:21.566 - 00:11:49.202, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. I think we learned a lot from the initial foray. A lot of people forget, but avalanche is not this EVM chain. It's not an EVM fork. It used an example of the EVM with avalanche consensus as it's first. Like, hey, here's an example of what avalanche can do with the EVM. And for better or worse, that actually has some certain trade offs.
00:11:49.202 - 00:12:39.774, Speaker A: One, developers are less sticky on the EVM in general because they can migrate to many chains or they're actually omnichannel, so to speak. They're deployed everywhere. So it's hard to actually calculate who's building on what chain. I think as the space migrates, what you're actually going to see, what you're starting to see is that developers will build on their own chains, and where they build on their own chains is where you actually have developed acquisition. So whether that's something like a subnet or something like op stack or Cosmos zone or whatever that is, that's where you're going to be able to get a better idea of where are the developers actually building. No difference in like, are you building your app on AWS or GCP or whatever? I think it's going to look like something like that. But developer acquisition is quite hard.
00:12:39.774 - 00:13:23.414, Speaker A: I think we've started to see some real traction this year with some of the initiatives that we've brought out. Like the Avalanche academy is one of the new things we've rolled out this year, which is a self paced learning, sort of learning courses. I think there's three courses right now with three slated to be added in the coming months. And, you know, you get your own certificate. You can show, you know, that you're competent in different types of things. This really allows us a better way to engage the developer from the perspective of, you know, something that's, you know, more fluid than documentation. You know, we've also noticed the drop off in some of the obvious questions that we were getting in the past for those who are taking the academy, which is really nice to see.
00:13:23.414 - 00:13:44.354, Speaker A: And so, you know, I think that's one basic thing. But we have a number of initiatives going on, on the technical side that are starting to really pique developers interest. So two things. One, we have precompiles for the EVM. So pre compile EVM, we call it. That's for a subnet. You want to deploy a subnet.
00:13:44.354 - 00:14:17.424, Speaker A: This is something that allows you to modify the state of the EVM and sort of have different types of triggers on the administrative layer that allow you to, like, get more performance or modify the actual environment a little bit. And that's something that some developers like to tinker with, and that's a differentiator. Outside of that, we have something called a hyper SDK. This is basically, you know, our in house built SDK for people who want to customize. This is non EVM at all. Just a caveat. Has nothing to do with EVM.
00:14:17.424 - 00:14:38.184, Speaker A: This thing is much faster than something like EVM makes different trade offs, and we're seeing a number of developers migrate and try to build on top of that as well. I think as we've differentiated our tech stack, we've sort of seen more developer engagement and interest with that stack.
00:14:39.144 - 00:15:18.564, Speaker B: Yeah, what's, what's really interesting about this is you're starting to see these kind of hybrid chains come online. I know Eclipse, like, launched a couple of weeks back, but I suppose with the infrastructure that's available on Avalanche and with the SDKs, something where they're creating this Frankenstein chain with like a rust developer environment and then consensus on Sylvester or whatever, however that stack looks. So how does Avalanche enable something akin to that in its current setup?
00:15:21.264 - 00:15:58.024, Speaker A: I like to tell people the subnet, the way it's designed right now, is very customizable. There's a lot you can do with it. There's actually a team called Node kit building. They're using a subnet with the hyper SDK to build a shared sequencer for a bunch of other roll ups. Outside of Avalanche, that's your example, if you want to use your Frankenstein analogy, that's entirely possible with the subnet as the back end leveraging avalanche consensus. So all that stuff is very possible with subnets. I think it remains to be seen which way the industry goes.
00:15:58.024 - 00:16:44.354, Speaker A: I'm really, really intrigued to see like sort of this modular stack play out and see like, okay, you can do all this stuff, but at the end of the day make it better. You know, I've seen us in this space take a lot of different approaches that are more complex, that, you know, have much more dependencies. And at the end of the day, like, people revert back to, all right, let me just deploy my own blockchain. You know, it's a, it's, it ends up being simpler. And so I'm curious to see that play out. I think we have the ability to sort of capitalize on whichever way the stack goes. With the hyper SDK, you have something super optimized akin to something like the Solana VM, but for your own blockchain.
00:16:44.354 - 00:17:25.184, Speaker A: And then with Subnet EVM, you have the ability to keep your existing application code and everything that you already have, deploy it at your own chain, and sort of get more scale from that. And not only scale, but you have like, the ability to sort of design your own chain is much more open. Whether it's tokenomics, whether it's like Ux, all this kind of stuff is definitely more open. And, you know, with avalanche warp messaging, you get the ability to interconnect with, whether it's a hyper SDK subnet or a move subnet or an EVM subnet that's all sort of integrated within the overall network.
00:17:26.164 - 00:18:02.296, Speaker B: Yeah, we recorded with Fish from Trader Joel last week on episode one of this. And he's obviously extremely close to what's happening in the deck space and how that landscape is going to develop. And he's kind of adamant that a lot of the innovation at the AmM level is kind of done. You've seen a lot of rfqs trying to sneak in there. I think Uniswap with Uniswap X are effectively saying, we don't know if this is going to work. We might end up pivoting to RFQ. But he was saying particularly what you were just saying at the kind of consensus layer.
00:18:02.296 - 00:18:44.468, Speaker B: I think the next level of innovation for a Dex is going to be being able to control what happens effectively under the hood and not just at the application layer. Anything that feels like that's going to be pivotal for the industry to move forward, particularly for Amm. So it's interesting to see that people who are so close to it are thinking in that way. And avalanche, obviously, with the flexibility to actually enable that, puts them in good stead. And, you know, I'm not really a fan of what's happening at Uniswap at the minute. I think they're just slapping a lot of business license and so on ip that's already been generated and there's a lot of talk about like how they're pivoting away from the Mm. So I don't know.
00:18:44.468 - 00:19:00.344, Speaker B: But it's interesting to see that people, if they wanted to build in that space and have the control of the full complete tech stack as opposed to just the application layer, then Avalanche X actually enables that. So interesting to see how that develops. But I don't know if you've had any conversations along those lines.
00:19:01.804 - 00:19:41.550, Speaker A: So, I mean, for anybody who was involved in finance when they saw uni v two, I don't think anybody was like, wow, like, this is crazy. You know, it's like, wow, this is pretty basic, you know, like, this is like not gonna work. It's cool because, you know, we were able to do stuff on chain and all that stuff, but like, it's not, it would never work at scale in something. You know, in finance, you know, we have clubs for a reason, central limit order book exchanges. And basically what you're seeing is concentrated amm basically in so many ways maneuvered to become very similar to a club. And I think that makes a lot of sense. It still provides benefits.
00:19:41.550 - 00:20:44.404, Speaker A: Like, I still think the composable nature of taking like, the LP token and being able to do things with it is new. That's an innovation. It's hard to do with a club in itself, but I think we're at a place now in the deck space where we have things like Dexalot, which is essential, limited order book exchange on its own sub that we have things like, you know, Trader Joe and their, you know, their amm, which is really cool and, and, you know, fast and very cheap, which is, you know, I've been, I've been really delighted to use that. And then we have things like cavalry, you know, which is a new avalanche app coming out and they're sort of finding their way and trying to build, you know, pools with tons and tons and tons of different assets. So, you know, there's still experimentation happening in the Dex space and there should be, you know, I would just say like, we're definitely squeezing, we're squeezing the last, last bit of juice out of there for now, you know, until there's, you know, different types of breakthroughs and research going forward.
00:20:45.384 - 00:21:06.572, Speaker B: Yeah, I suppose you must see a lot, a lot of stuff particular being in the position that you're in and before, I suppose, the rest of the industry and the user base sees it. But is there anything in particular that you're extremely excited by that maybe people aren't really fully aware of at this.
00:21:06.588 - 00:21:10.172, Speaker A: Point in time in general, or.
00:21:10.348 - 00:21:25.040, Speaker B: Yeah, just anything that's coming across the desk or anything. Yeah, we start in Defi and then maybe if there's anything broader, because I'm a bit of a Defi nut, but again, the consumer app and social application thing has kind of captured my attention an awful lot.
00:21:25.072 - 00:22:27.036, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, I've always had this opinion that DeFi is basically going to be like the top of the funnel for all the other applications. Like, it'll just work with everything else. I don't think it's going to be the focus point of everything else. And so, like, I have to be honest, like, I haven't seen much that's knocked my socks off in a while in Defi, you know, I think we've sort of had a innovation sort of lull for a while, you know, and I think that comes naturally. Like, we built the basic primitives, we're optimizing them, and, you know, now it's a matter of taking stock and be like, okay, like, you know, there is one app that I can't mention that is coming soon that I'm very excited about. It won't be the type of app that, like, you know, will blow your mind forever, but it's like a very, very well designed add on to a lending platform that you're like, wow, we brought in some real finance guys to build something that we needed, and here it is. So I think you're going to see continuous things like that.
00:22:27.036 - 00:22:56.648, Speaker A: But, like, you know, being able to borrow and lend, you know, under collateralized would be really cool. Nobody solved this. Nobody still solved identity, which is a big problem in terms of the space. Like, that was a problem, like 2016, you know, ico days. Everybody was, like, raising a bunch of money for that. Still, nobody's, like, shipped something that is, you know, that's gained, gained share. So I've been, I've been excited by the social stuff, you know, coming.
00:22:56.648 - 00:23:26.040, Speaker A: You know, I, like I said, I built a social app in 2017, so it's obviously near and dear to my heart. And I've always felt like this space was really well tuned for it. So I've been saying for a while internally, like, we're gonna see, like, I was like, we need a social fight team. I didn't call it social, but I called the social type social team. I'm like, this is gonna be, you know, a space that starts to eventually come together. Problem was, I said that, like, two years ago, so it didn't happen for a minute. I was still thinking about steam.
00:23:26.040 - 00:23:32.124, Speaker A: It, you know, if anybody's been around for a while, play with steemit. Back in the day, the old crypto app.
00:23:33.364 - 00:24:18.424, Speaker B: Yeah. It's always, you see a lot of people scrambling last minute and, like, the amount of, like, pitch decks I see personally that have came off the back of, like, friendtech and stars arena and stuff like that. It's like, God, here we go. But again, I'm at least, it's kind of, as you say, put a bit of, you know, a bit of interest into, like, new development and open the design space a little bit. Whereas I think we got to the point where as we both touched upon it was iterations of folks. And yes, there was some innovation happening, but it was very iterative. And this feels like it's kind of came out of left field and definitely captured some people's attention where, you know, people might have been getting a little bit bored with what was currently available.
00:24:18.424 - 00:24:32.754, Speaker B: So, yeah, what, what do you, what, why do you think it has captured the attention of so many people so much? And I think we should, naturally, we should focus in on stars arena and. Yeah, what. Can you put your finger on it?
00:24:33.894 - 00:25:19.324, Speaker A: Good question. When friend tech came out, I got pretty excited. I was a little scared initially just because I was a little nervous using my own personal account and all that kind of stuff. Didn't really know how everything was going to be sort of track and handle and all that stuff. But when it came out, I was like, finally, like, here we go. Now, people's minds can be open to the idea of what you can do with different types of social applications, because one thing crypto is really good at is accelerating the timeline to build a network like a human network. It's really, really good at this.
00:25:19.324 - 00:25:58.278, Speaker A: You know, it also accelerates the time to kill a network at the same time. So it's, you know, you need to, you need to, it's really good at bootstrapping, and then you need to get to a sustainable, like, pace. And you can do that if product is good, but if products not good, you know, it's sort of this up and down type of thing. So what I saw there was like okay. I don't know if the end game is like this idea of trading your friends, but I do know that, like, the idea of incorporating sort of defi elements into social is something that I think people will like. Right. People like to count their followers.
00:25:58.278 - 00:26:57.194, Speaker A: They like to, you know, look at how much traction their Instagram post made or their TikTok stuff. And, you know, there's no reason that you integrating number one, the crypto payment rails, but also the crypto economic stuff into that wouldn't work. Like, especially, and this is the key element, especially if you could solve for the onboarding, you know, because, like, that was the challenge, you know, being like, hey, want to use some crypto hinge app? And then, like, you go use it and takes like 25 minutes to just get set up like people, it's not gonna happen. So, you know, I think friend tech did a really good job leading the way there. And then I think stars arena did a fantastic job of making the onboarding really easy. Like, when I was in Milan for that week that I was exploding, you know, I must have onboarded like ten people who are friends just like showing them the app, and it was like 2 seconds. It was just like onboarding somebody on, like, you know, Snapchat back in the day.
00:26:58.974 - 00:27:28.586, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like anecdotes of people sat on planes and trains. I think they were coming back from the conference or going to the conference and like, yeah, just, just sign someone up, got a ref link out, and it's just, it's one of those things where it picture interesting. Like, I do not want to be late to the next kind of movement. So everyone's like, happy to jump on board. And I think where it really excelled, particularly stars arena, was opening up that public feed. The tipping was great. Genius as well.
00:27:28.586 - 00:28:20.574, Speaker B: I think it was some ridiculous number of traction transactions on seachain were primarily coming through stars arena at one point, and it was just like, yeah, this is, this is really, really, really cool. And I think it should be a more social experience, and I think the public feed really lends itself well to that. But, you know, again, that onboarding experience, the first time, like, with friends tech, I thought I must have missed a step here. This didn't feel like a crypto ux onboarding experience whatsoever, um, but it was, and that was, like, kind of refreshing to see after years and years of just painstakingly putting up with the likes of metamask. Yeah, yeah, I think that onboarding experience was, was enough to kind of get a lot of people's you know, mind and attention focused on the actual app in and of itself.
00:28:22.114 - 00:28:54.504, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it goes without saying, like, a lot of the features are quite good. You know, it remains to be seen, you know, sort of what comes out of this whole thing. But, you know, that's funny. I think the name, the arena name came from, like, obviously this Theodore Roosevelt quote, I think that I kept posting, you know, because, like, it's 2023. It's been a long bear market. You know, I remember 2019 distinctly. And, you know, there was nothing to do, really.
00:28:54.504 - 00:29:49.678, Speaker A: There was very little to do on chain, and it was hard to stick around. You know, like, your friends were all, like, getting better jobs. They were making money elsewhere. They were, like, having a chill life. And here you are grinding on, you know, like, the hopes of compound, you know, the hopes of uniswap eventually coming. And this is how this feels in a lot of ways, you know, and so being in the arena, trying things in the sense of, like, all right, like, this might not be the end form of the application that everybody ends up adopting or using, you know, but this, I feel like this is something to pay attention to at, you know, writ large, like this movement, this sort of, you know, new play in the space. And somebody, I don't know who, but I think somebody will take the basics of what has been developed here and build, you know, an application that can be used at scale.
00:29:49.678 - 00:30:10.822, Speaker A: And if they do that, you know, it'll be the first time that I think crypto has an actual widely used use case. And that's why I'm excited. I don't know who it'll be. I don't know which app it'll be. I don't know where it'll happen. But, like, it makes sense to pay attention, you know, in general, do you.
00:30:10.838 - 00:30:29.054, Speaker B: Think that vision comes from withinside the industry and then it cuts through, or do you think that comes from an established product that has ridiculous distribution and then integrates? Like, what do you think is more likely to happen?
00:30:29.434 - 00:31:27.290, Speaker A: Fantastic question. Like, I've sort of sort of debated myself with this, you know, over the years, whether or not the incumbents will adopt a tech or whether or not, you know, it's needed for the. I think it really depends on the business model in this scenario. Like, let's say, trading tickets or whatever becomes something that gets well adopted. It could work in a way where it doesn't disrupt the existing business model. And if somebody like Elon is, you know, you know, humble enough to look at it and use it, then, you know, there's no reason that they wouldn't be able to do it. But it does feel like in a lot of ways, and I didn't, I'm not sure I thought this would happen when Elon took over initially, but it does feel like that there's a growing sense of, like, tearing down the establishment of existing social media platforms.
00:31:27.290 - 00:32:18.074, Speaker A: Like, I have been saying for a long time that I thought that a lot of these sort of marketplace web two applications were the ones to be, well, disintermediated by crypto, like the Facebooks, the Airbnbs, the ubers. Like, I've always thought that these were, like, very obvious. I know that they're hard and there's like a million challenges with doing so. But the business model from the get go, you know, is very, you know, it extracts a lot from the users. And so because of that, crypto could build an interesting model and because of the acceleration of a network effect, like, you know, it has the best chance of sort of dethroning some of these other guys. So I think my guess today is it's likely not to be exist in incumbent, at least in the beginning, but I think either would be cool.
00:32:18.774 - 00:32:42.104, Speaker B: Agreed. So there's another kind of large, looming area of the industry that's been kind of flourishing, particularly over the past, I'd say twelve months. And that's real world assets and rwas, which I hate the terminology around it. And I got told off at Token 2049 about this by a big protocol that I building in this space, probably the biggest.
00:32:43.724 - 00:32:45.104, Speaker A: What did they say to you?
00:32:45.564 - 00:33:06.924, Speaker B: So I basically posted that real world assets has less syllables than rwas. So I don't know why we shorten it and abbreviate it. And both terminology is stupid and it's like marginalizes us again as an industry by calling them real world assets. And I don't think it's a great terminology, to be honest. I'll tell you who it was.
00:33:08.904 - 00:33:10.168, Speaker A: It's a bad term.
00:33:10.336 - 00:33:26.724, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think you've had a similar thought around this, and I'd love to kind of see what's happening in the avalanche ecosystem. If there's anything that you're seeing, if there's anything, even just your personal thoughts on it, where do you think and how do you think this plays out?
00:33:27.144 - 00:34:00.248, Speaker A: So, I mean, the reason real world assets is a bad, is a bad term is because, and, you know, RWA stands for risk weighted assets in tradfi. So when you go approach somebody new about this, they have no idea what you're talking about. You know, and also like real world assets, I think about that. You know, the US dollar is a real world asset. I don't know, is it like, it's just a bad terminology? Because it's, you know, I mean, it's literally called fiat money. So I don't know if we'd call it real world and it's based on faith. And so anyways, like, you know, not.
00:34:00.248 - 00:34:48.572, Speaker A: I do think as an industry we have a really, really, really bad way of having, you know, creating nomenclature. And as an industry, one thing we do really bad is sort of getting together and like pushing the overall agenda of the industry together. Instead, what you have is like 15 different entities trying to kill each other to advance something. And, you know, it's not great. It doesn't create anything super cohesive. So net net, what I'd say is like, you know, our terminology that we've adopted internally is when you tokenize something that already exists in the tradfi market, we call it tokenizing off chain assets, right? Ocas. It's very simple.
00:34:48.572 - 00:35:39.404, Speaker A: You tokenize something that's already off chain, you bring it on chain, right? And then when it's, when it's on chain, you can call it chained assets or you could just call it an asset. But I do think there will be a long term distinction between something that's on chain and not on chain, just like something's online and not online. And I think that's going to be the distinction versus real world assets. I think we're still very early on this world and avalanche as a whole has really led in this space. I think we've announced things like the Spruce network in collaboration with Wisdom Tree, Wellington and Tiro. We have a number of initiatives underway that'll be, you know, public in near future. And, you know, we have the Avalanche Vista fund, which is $50 million from the foundation dedicated to buying up sort of these types of assets.
00:35:39.404 - 00:36:42.248, Speaker A: But net net, like, there's still a lot of work to be done in order to make this, you know, a value add for the actual sort of existing industry. Like if you take something that's already off chain and you bring it on chain, now you're managing two ledgers, you're increasing the work. You're not actually getting the benefits of a tokenized asset. Like, you know, for example, automated cash flows, automated margin, all this other stuff, because you're still maintaining the second ledger. And I understand, like, this is a parallel process for the short term, but it still is, like, not not ideal from like a. Not ideal from like a longer term perspective. So until we can get native assets issued on chain, until we can get sort of assets being tokenized on chain, where sort of the data and the overall settlement of the asset is also comes with it, you know, we still have a long way to go.
00:36:42.248 - 00:37:07.424, Speaker A: I know everybody's excited about t bills on chain. I think it's cool, too, to bring some yield on chain with that. There's still, like regulatory uncertainty. There still is a gray area in terms of who can touch it. I'm in the US probably can't touch any of this stuff, but I'm excited to see us experimenting with different collateral in general, I just think we're earlier than a lot of people wanted on that front.
00:37:08.344 - 00:37:42.544, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. And another kind of what's been the talk of the town for the past 1218 months. But we see an awful lot of development in the ethereum l two space. Right. But my concerns around how rapidly this is evolving is I feel like a lot of projects are using as a bit of a scare patch to kind of say, look, we're still building. We're just going to create an l two. Is it necessarily needed? I'm not entirely sure a lot of them are.
00:37:42.544 - 00:38:04.752, Speaker B: We've also got a huge liquidity fragmentation issue, and obviously there's a lot of interop being built. But how does avalanche position itself against, or as like a kind of antidote to that increased fragmentation across what we're seeing across different other ecosystems? I'd love to kind of pick your brain and get the information straight from.
00:38:04.768 - 00:38:34.588, Speaker A: The source, effectively, yeah, there's a lot to unpack here. So with respect to Ethereum and its l two roadmap, this is something that they've been planning for a while, been working on for a while. I think l two s have certain merits. They're still as. It's all I get, a lot of people say, on training wheels, but the reason there's fragmentation is you're seeing ten different general purposes. Launching don't really need that. You know, there is a demand for this right now.
00:38:34.588 - 00:39:25.316, Speaker A: Like, we don't have demand for 20 different DeFi ecosystems today, you know, but what you have is a lot of, you know, people who want to sell tokens, you know, get rich, make money, you know, and also the, you know, there's the price to be one of the few standing is large. And this is what I was referring to in the beginning where, like, you know, as an industry, we don't do a good job of, like, pushing the greater good. Instead, we all try to, like, tear each other down and kill each other and, you know, see who stands. So I think, like, the reason we have liquidity fragmentation is because we have too many general purpose altos. Like, there is not enough activity on base, on optimism, on arbitrum, on whichever Polygon's live now. Like, they're not. There's not enough activity for all these defi ecosystems, let alone eth mainnet.
00:39:25.316 - 00:39:43.100, Speaker A: I think I saw Gwei drop below, like, ten. You know, there's. There's just not. There's no. There's no demand for this stuff. And we keep building the same thing. You know, I went to a conference, and I saw, like, five chains I've never heard of, you know, talking about their new Defi incentive program.
00:39:43.100 - 00:40:03.148, Speaker A: Like, it's 2021. I was just like, man. You know, just like, wow. Yeah, yeah, it's. It's exhausting, really, because it's like, man, like, you know, we're, we're just, this is a wrong. Like, the one thing the space hasn't done well is it doesn't have a good allocation of resources. Like, that's not what we need people to build.
00:40:03.148 - 00:40:24.564, Speaker A: Like, infrastructure is pretty good these days. Like, you know, avalanche works really well. Some l two s work decently. Salon is working better. You know, infrastructure is working. You want your own chain, you could deploy a subnet in ten minutes. You know, that's great, but you're not going to have, in my opinion, 100 general purpose subnets.
00:40:24.564 - 00:41:11.770, Speaker A: You have the avalanche c chain, which is a hub, you know, and then everything else will flow from there. So you have subnets like, you know, Godzilla building their game off the grid. You know, you have, like, the TSM subnet that's coming. Something like Hubble, which is like a perp exchange Dex a lot subnet. Now, these are, these are different use cases in app chains, but all liquidity flowing from the c chain and all those subnets being able to talk to each other in an interoperable way via AWM is the powerful nature. What's nice about something like AWM that a lot of people don't talk about is, let's say I have dexalot subnet, and then I have off the grid subnet or TSM subnet. You know, the only validators involved in that transaction between them are each other's validators.
00:41:11.770 - 00:41:37.576, Speaker A: So you don't increase. Like, you don't introduce this new trust assumption that third party bridges typically do. And that's really working in our conversations. With different folks about deploying subnets and, you know, there's still work to be done. I know there's a lot of community conversation on, like the cost of deploying a subnet and stuff like that. That's stuff that we hope to address. But in general, like, I would say on the infrastructure side, you don't need this many l two s.
00:41:37.576 - 00:41:54.484, Speaker A: I have a number of issues with l two s general, you know, as the preferred choice. If you want, we can go into those. If not, like, you know, I think we positioned. Why? I think Avalanche has a good sort of architecture to capitalize on an app chain world.
00:41:54.984 - 00:42:22.442, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd love to, again, just like double click on your own kind of personal reasons around that because as I said, a lot of conversations, particularly online, with algorithms and stuff like that, we find ourselves in an echo chamber and it's always good to open up the discussion and people get blindsided by a lot of stuff that they absolutely know nothing about. So I'd love to kind of just pick your brain on that if you've got the time to get into it.
00:42:22.598 - 00:42:57.110, Speaker A: So here's my thoughts. I have a few fundamental issues with the idea of l two s as a loan scaling solution. So I want to make sure I'm specific in my answers. And I'm not painting with a broad brush as a loan scaling solution. Fundamentally, everything built on one layer doesn't introduce much fault isolation, right? So if eth mainnet ever has an issue, the whole thing crashes. The whole thing, you know, comes to a halt. When I say an issue, I mean a real issue.
00:42:57.110 - 00:43:24.314, Speaker A: Like, and that's, that's possible. Like Ethu is, you know, a year old as a proof of stake network. So, you know, anything can happen there. So building on top of one layer to me is just inherently dangerous and creates this sort of house of cards, you know, whereas if you pull out one card, everything crumble. And I'm not saying it's going to happen. I'm not, you know, but fundamentally, I don't like that type of architecture. Like, I like fault isolation.
00:43:24.314 - 00:44:08.994, Speaker A: So that's one issue I have. The other issue I think they're going to have. And I don't think they came, I don't think they thought of the design. I don't think they thought of this in the design was the economic considerations that need to be taken, you know, that need to be taken into account when you think about N two. So let's say I'm something like TSM and I want to deploy an l two my own l two app chain and let's say today I have that deployed and I have a bunch of users and whatever the cost is, it is. But let's say today's FOmc day, Jerome Powell's going to get up there and have a big speech. Markets are going to go crazy geopolitically, like macro is going to move a lot.
00:44:08.994 - 00:44:52.270, Speaker A: How does it make sense that my gaming users on my l two all of a sudden at 02:00 p.m. eastern are paying a much higher price for each one of their transactions because ETH l one block space is totally enough. Fundamentally that is not an app chain. That doesn't isolate performance, that doesn't isolate costs and fees. And you know, I call this the variable fee issue for l two s and l three s. And I know that they have things to address this with like proto date sharding and stuff which should reduce the cost, but that the reduction of cost is just relative. And we're in a bear market.
00:44:52.270 - 00:45:30.676, Speaker A: Nobody's using you colon, when they're all using it, you know, and because it has the most liquidity, people will use it. Then I think that you're going to constantly run into this issue and so what their solution will be, the solution will be, okay, well let's move this to an l three. Great. We have now like whatever, I don't know, twelve day finality four times faster than tradfi and we still at a smaller scale. But we still have this fundamental same issue, that the fees are variable to exogenous activity. And that's not something that anybody ever talks about. For some reason that makes no sense to me.
00:45:30.676 - 00:46:03.826, Speaker A: A lot of times I use this analogy that deploying your own l two as an app chain is like renting an office and weWork. You might do this if you have no product market fit yet you don't even know if you're going to be here in a month. You might just roll your quick l two. But once you have users and everything's popping off, you're not going to be able to work anymore. It's too expensive. You're paying a huge premium for convenience and infrastructure and you're not going to pay that anymore. You're going to move over to your own office and, you know, which I think will be your own true app chain.
00:46:03.826 - 00:46:21.334, Speaker A: So that's my, that's my view, you know, at the current state of things and the issues that I see with it. With that said, I think a lot of the ZK tech on the, on the roll up side is really, really interesting, but just not sure it's like good. The right tech for scaling in general. Maybe it could be the right tech for like bridges.
00:46:22.954 - 00:46:37.828, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks a lot. Makes a lot of sense. And again, it's nice to hear both sides of the argument. So you touched on gaming a little bit there. I interviewed Mark from shrapnel the other day and that's legit. Oh, yeah.
00:46:37.876 - 00:46:39.664, Speaker A: Very legit. Very legit.
00:46:40.844 - 00:46:41.828, Speaker B: Very legit.
00:46:41.956 - 00:46:54.902, Speaker A: And great team. Great team. They are on top of their subnet and I've been very impressed with their, I guess, like, ability to think ahead in the architecture.
00:46:55.038 - 00:46:57.494, Speaker B: Yeah. Is. Have you been close to that much?
00:46:57.614 - 00:47:28.334, Speaker A: You know, I don't run the gaming stuff. You know, I sort of look at it from a periphery view. I'm excited for it to launch, let's put it that way. Like, I feel like, you know, off the grid has been in development for four years, so it's supposed to go live soon. But like, you know, these games take a long, they take a minute to build. And, you know, for Avalanche in general, we want to. We want to show what a subnet can do and we think that, you know, these might be a way to do that.
00:47:28.414 - 00:47:30.326, Speaker B: Yeah. And the TSM is huge as well, isn't it?
00:47:30.390 - 00:48:01.674, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Blitz app as a subnet is pretty neat. And they have some interesting, I think, surprises that, that, that'll engage a lot of users, a lot of non crypto users, to be very clear, that's who's going to use this stuff. And so I think one thing avalanche is doing as a whole is rather than fighting over the same hundred thousand crypto users, if even we're trying to find new use cases to bring different people in, that's been our focus for a while now.
00:48:05.094 - 00:48:23.214, Speaker B: You might be adjacent to this, but what is, what's the real, what's the main reasons that these big names are choosing avalanche over whatever else might be out there? Is there any kind of recurring theme that you guys are hearing internally that ticks the boxes for them? Like.
00:48:24.994 - 00:48:47.102, Speaker A: So I think we haven't seen. Well, on the enterprise side, like, I think that's what you're talking about, institutional side. Like, I don't think an l two is going to be appealing. You know, they need to buy and burn eth. You know, the WeWork example is a really good example. Like, these apps already have product market fit. Like, they don't need your security.
00:48:47.102 - 00:49:36.934, Speaker A: They have more security than you potentially. So, like, they don't care about that. What they do care about is I'm like, hey, how can I build a stable architecture and stable blockchain fast? And Subnet's a great example of that. Like with things like Alpha cloud coming online, you know, where you're able to, like, write into a GuI, deploy your own subnet in like five minutes with different customizations, you know, that's, that we're, we're, we have a team internally at avalabs that's thinking with that in mind. And also, you know, we've, we've inherited many different, I guess, deals from enterprises who have chosen a different, different provider and then used that tech and then said, you know what? Like, we're going to come build a subnet. This other stuff isn't really working. It's not ready.
00:49:36.934 - 00:49:46.282, Speaker A: I think just being the boring stable guy sometimes has worked for us and I think the team is very professional and that helps as well.
00:49:46.458 - 00:50:04.144, Speaker B: We've got around five minutes left. One question and then a couple of quick fires, if that's all right with you. Sure. If you weren't in this current position now with everything that's going on in the world, what do you think you'd be focusing your attention on and building?
00:50:04.804 - 00:50:30.998, Speaker A: That's a good question. I've been very intrigued by sort of the social fi stuff and different ways that crypto can, like, help. Third part, you know, like third world countries. That's. That's something that I've been really intrigued by. But I guess, like, I'm still in the mindset of, like, I want to build something that, like, gets the market in scales and, like, shows that this tech can actually be adopted. Like, that's.
00:50:30.998 - 00:50:55.914, Speaker A: That's where my head's at. You know, if I'm not doing that, I'm probably, like, going to become a chef or something like that. Like, I don't know. I mean, you know, like, I don't know what else I'd be doing right now. This is the thing that excites me and wakes, gets me up in the morning, so that's the thing that I'll, I'll do. And I feel like I'm adding value, so if I ever feel like I'm not adding value, I probably won't do it anymore.
00:50:57.654 - 00:51:02.794, Speaker B: Great answer. So quick fire. Apple or Android?
00:51:03.254 - 00:51:04.314, Speaker A: Apple, always.
00:51:04.934 - 00:51:07.314, Speaker B: What stablecoin do you prefer to hold?
00:51:12.134 - 00:51:19.014, Speaker A: No, because I am in the US USDC.
00:51:20.754 - 00:51:22.334, Speaker B: Books. Are audiobooks.
00:51:27.834 - 00:51:31.334, Speaker A: Interesting? I prefer audiobooks now.
00:51:32.114 - 00:51:36.094, Speaker B: Same. And how many coffees a day is the right amount.
00:51:38.194 - 00:51:40.294, Speaker A: For me? Three, maybe four.
00:51:42.534 - 00:51:48.994, Speaker B: I feel like this one's gonna be like, I'm gonna offend you with this last one. Pineapple pizza.
00:51:51.614 - 00:52:03.494, Speaker A: You know, it's. It's. It's interesting. I was in Italy a few times, and, you know, over the past few months, and they're. They're putting weird shit on pizza, too. And I'm cool for the experimentation. I get it.
00:52:03.494 - 00:52:15.394, Speaker A: But, like, don't. Don't come at me. Don't come at me with this, like, pineapple supposed to be on pizza. Stuff like, that's fine if you want that as an adjacent thing, but, you know, let's. Let's keep the margarita nice and clean.
00:52:16.694 - 00:52:20.782, Speaker B: I'm in Spain at the minute, and the. They quite like egg on pizza. Like a fried pizza.
00:52:20.798 - 00:52:23.126, Speaker A: Yeah, they do. Yeah. I'm not a fan.
00:52:23.310 - 00:52:28.222, Speaker B: No. Um, are you gonna. You must be in Barcelona soon, is that right?
00:52:28.358 - 00:52:34.994, Speaker A: Um, no, I will be in Istanbul for the Avalanche house that we have November 14 during dev connect week.
00:52:35.414 - 00:52:40.572, Speaker B: Yeah, we're gonna be coming out. I think me, Jerry, and Dan are gonna fly. First time in a stan bullet before.
00:52:40.668 - 00:52:41.044, Speaker A: Me too.
00:52:41.084 - 00:52:42.444, Speaker B: I'm really looking forward to it.
00:52:42.564 - 00:52:43.444, Speaker A: I've never been.
00:52:43.564 - 00:52:52.024, Speaker B: Yeah, my friends are there at the minute, and they've just sent me the food that they've been indulging on the past couple of days, and they feel, like, 30 kilos heavier.
00:52:53.124 - 00:53:21.464, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll have to, you know, travel in general. It's not good for the body. You know, I like to say I'm one. Maybe I'm, like, maybe older in this genre, in this space than many others. You know, I'll be 35 soon, so there's, like, you know, I can't really. I can't really grind with the rest of them, you know, in terms of the travel. So I'm trying to limit my travel a little bit more than I used to the last two years.
00:53:21.804 - 00:53:34.464, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. Is there anything I might have missed off that you want to kind of leave the listeners or viewers with? If there's anything that you kind of want to focus people's mind and attention on or equally, we can just wrap up.
00:53:34.544 - 00:53:44.760, Speaker A: Um, no, I mean, I think. I think we hit a lot of the. The cool points. The stars arena stuff was fun, you know, different stuff with different tech and infrastructure. So, you know, I think. I think we hit on a lot of different points.
