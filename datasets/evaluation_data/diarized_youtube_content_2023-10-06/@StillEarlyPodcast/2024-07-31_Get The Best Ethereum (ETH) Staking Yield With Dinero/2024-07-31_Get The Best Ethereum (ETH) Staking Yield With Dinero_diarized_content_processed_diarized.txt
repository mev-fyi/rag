00:00:00.200 - 00:00:02.854, Speaker A: I think that's massive. Like, it's huge.
00:00:02.902 - 00:00:04.846, Speaker B: Oh, fucking believe me, it was.
00:00:04.918 - 00:00:06.610, Speaker A: I bet that was a pain in the ass.
00:00:10.830 - 00:01:00.622, Speaker B: But it was worth it. We changed, like the distribution mechanism a little bit. So like with Butterfly, the old token, you would lock it for 16 week intervals, and every epoch, two weeks, we would distribute that ETH that was generated on all the products, hidden hand and whatnot, back to the users for participating in governance as an incentive. Right. And with Sdnero, we're going towards a more industry standard, single side stake solution. There will still be the incentive for you to stake and participate in governance, but the ETH that's getting generated on all things, we're not deprecating hidden hand or anything, but like, all the eth yield that's generated on ipxe, Pxe, pxusD, hiddenhand, all these different things that we're doing will be going back in the form of buybacks. Quick one, nothing here is financial advice.
00:01:00.622 - 00:01:09.770, Speaker B: It's for entertainment and educational purposes only. Always do your own research or speak to a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Enjoy the episode and like. And subscribe.
00:01:15.830 - 00:01:23.250, Speaker A: Alright, welcome back. This man needs no introduction. He's been on here more times than I have myself. I think the most recurring guest, Sami, how's it going?
00:01:23.770 - 00:01:25.710, Speaker B: What up? How are you doing?
00:01:26.090 - 00:01:39.190, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just saying there's, uh, I don't think, I think apart from, uh. Yeah, you're definitely the most recurring guest. I think it's been like three or four times now, so thanks for doing that. And, uh, I can only imagine how hectic it is on your end. So how's it going?
00:01:40.090 - 00:02:02.300, Speaker B: Um, yeah, no, I was just telling you before this, it's going good. Um, obviously, like, staying very busy, and I think most of it is actually just staying on top of telegram, um, responding to everyone. So I haven't had much time to, like, you know, relax. But, you know, I'm happy that, I'm happy that we're able to, like, start getting stuff out the door now. So.
00:02:02.380 - 00:02:30.812, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, man. When you change in the industry, you don't have much time to last, so. But, yeah, what's. From the outside looking in, it looks like there's been a lot. Can we start with, like, is it a rebrand? Is it a pivot? Is like, what, what is it? Where's your heads at with that? Obviously coming from redacted and now been known as Dinero. Is it more of a product update? Like film? Fill me in, like, where your head's at with this whole kind of reemergence of what you guys have got going.
00:02:30.836 - 00:03:14.886, Speaker B: On, I think it's multifaceted. Right. So the main problem that existed with redacted, specifically, was that it was too far down the rabbit hole in the sense that there was, like, a million things going on. Px this, px that, new hidden hand markets. And then there's this PXE Dinero product that was coming out, and it was just too complicated for the average person. And I think that while the revenue being diversified is a great thing, and I wouldn't change it, we got limited in the sense of having very low glass ceilings. Right.
00:03:14.886 - 00:03:53.474, Speaker B: Our niches and, like, the way and our angles were limited. Right. It's how big can a bribe market get? How big can the curve ecosystem get? How big can, you know, all these little things that we had a grip on? And that's what led us to do the De Niro product in general. Right. The dinero product is just like a much grander. And when I say the dinero product, I mean, what is now PX USD. And the opportunity was just in the hundreds of millions, if not billions, where everything else was so limited.
00:03:53.474 - 00:04:18.720, Speaker B: And on top of it being limited, it was not easily understandable. It wasn't digesting with most people. And at the same time, I'm sure we'll talk about today, the IPX eth announcement. We needed to put on a bit more of a serious face, right. So we needed to do two things. We needed to hone in the scope so that the product is easily explainable in one sentence. Two sentences.
00:04:18.720 - 00:04:46.016, Speaker B: And we needed to be a bit more serious because, like, everyone loves the, you know, retarded cartel brand. I love it. And the butterfly will. Will live on through PX Eth, but it was too crypto native. Right. And a lot of the. Our new angle and, like, a new place, we found edge is on the institutional side.
00:04:46.016 - 00:05:17.950, Speaker B: Right. And, you know, it's not like, dinero is much better because it's also, like, a slang word and it's not a whole lot better. But I think it was a natural sort of. You know, I looked at, like, the ribbon avo migration as, like, a big success, whereas I think, like, ribbon was also this kind of, like, confusing, even though it was vaults kind of confusing product with a bunch of different to it, and they moved to, like, avo, and it was just everyone understood it. Right. I want to do, like, the same thing here. And our avo is Dinero.
00:05:19.170 - 00:06:17.622, Speaker A: Was there any? I suppose that's a really good example, because sometimes it can get a bit messy. Like, I know aave is like, now they're under this kind of like, parent umbrella company with like, avara or whatever they call them. It's just like, what the hell is going on here? Are these all going to fit in together? But you guys like it? Look like you've really, as I say, simplified the offering. And I think with how complex it was, as you say, I think for the Defi nerd or the defi note, it was just like, right, this is the coolest thing on the market. But like, as you say, explaining that beyond the 1% of people who are in that bucket must have been quite difficult. But how far did you guys get down the road with regards to Dinero looking like it was going to be a stable coin to being like, this is a bigger fish to start concentrating on with IPX Eve, like, was it a difficult decision to go? Did you have to take a couple steps back and then go and attack it? What did that kind of focus process look like?
00:06:17.766 - 00:06:53.148, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think there's two things to that question, right? The first part is that the stable coin is still a core part of the strategy. It's just Dinero was like, too good of a name to waste on the stable coin. PX USD is the new name of the stablecoin. I think it just, it's easier. PXE px USD, it's a lot easier to explain to people. And Dinero always was, like, the umbrella that existed above all of those things. So now the umbrella is what the project's name is.
00:06:53.148 - 00:06:57.200, Speaker B: And the second part of the question was repeat it.
00:06:57.700 - 00:07:17.320, Speaker A: So, like, how far. How far down the road did you get? Or like, was it even like, you know, did you start at the same starting point with regards to maybe we go and chase institutions or chase the USD stable coin? Like, or did you backtrack a bit? Or like, how'd that work?
00:07:18.010 - 00:08:14.126, Speaker B: I'm never a big fan of roadmaps, and I try to, whatever I put my hands on, I try to make sure that people don't lock themselves into multi year roadmaps, because things just change. What changed with DeFi specifically was that DeFi exists in this market. DeFi exists in the middle of the curve, where it's not risk on enough to get people excited, like meme coins on Solana, and it's not write curve enough to get institutions excited like bitcoin eth or random finance launch token or something. Right? So DeFi just exists. It's around it's getting safer. The bull market came a bit too early, actually, in my opinion, for Defi, because a lot of the issues didn't get addressed. Multi chain didn't get addressed, hacks didn't get addressed, UX didn't get addressed, right.
00:08:14.126 - 00:08:52.018, Speaker B: And Defi is in this weird spot now where a lot of the energy that was being put on, making sure it's a working product is, is going to the extremes, right, of either being very retail focused or very institutional focused. But there is a few things that work in DeFi, right? Lsds. LSD's took over the market. Rwas are something I'm not too excited about, but people are really excited about. And just the more sustainable, compliant offerings are like, what's taking up all the attention in Defi nowadays?
00:08:52.194 - 00:09:15.590, Speaker A: Can I, can I just, can I double click on the RWA thing? Because it's like RWA one? I can't stand that fucking terminology. Real world asset. Like, it really pisses me off. But you guys are kind of going the other way, and I don't know if. Do you see that being the more, what's the word?
00:09:18.450 - 00:09:22.590, Speaker B: I have a better word than RWAs. We're doing fake world assets. That's what we.
00:09:25.370 - 00:09:28.826, Speaker A: I thought you'd have something. I was going to say, like non real world assets or some shit, but.
00:09:28.898 - 00:11:08.450, Speaker B: Yeah, fake assets, I think, like, okay, so the thing about fake world assets is that it actually is. Okay. My problem with RWAs is that they, we don't have the infrastructure in place on Ethereum yet to even create like a truly decentralized, stable coin, right? We can't even tokenize eth properly, right? So if we can't even tokenize a native asset that exists on the chain that should be conforming to what the developer needs, then how are we supposed to bring mortgages and t bills and all of these different things on chain? And it's very jank the way it's done, right? The thing about fake world assets, though, is that all the infrastructure that existed prior to RWAs becoming a thing was to get stuff like Ethereum yield in the hands of institutions and people who value compliance more, right? So I think fake world assets are overdue in the sense that Ethereum yield is uncorrelated. It's like a truly uncorrelated source of yield, maybe in terms of padditive volatility reduces and reduces as more institutions will get onboarded, but in terms of yield, it's truly uncorrelated. And people love that. I think that if you can come to the market with something like we offer with APX ETH, which is seven points, eight points, nine points, three fold, two fold higher than lido and some of the others on the market. It's very compelling.
00:11:08.450 - 00:11:56.012, Speaker B: And we've been building PXE with these guys. Maybe not galaxies much, but laser nomores crypto arm for, like, basically for over like, a year now. Right? And that's the reason it took so long to get to market, was because, like, it sucked, because, like, no one could talk about it. But the reason it took to market was because we had to jump through so many, like, unbelievable loopholes, kycing like, my dog, basically make this a thing. But we built it side by side with them. We made sure that it's, like, institutional grade. I think that's the easiest way to explain it.
00:11:56.012 - 00:12:30.736, Speaker B: And we had to put it on Mainnet also for, like, six months just to prove that the six months that we were on Mainnet were the highest yielding each solution. If you don't, you know, if you also are not a believer in points and other, you know, scams. Right? So, like, we've been the highest yielding eth solution on the market for five, six months, and we were able to, like, prove that with real data. And now the time is here to sort of get this product. Product out on the market. And. Yeah, I'll pause there.
00:12:30.908 - 00:13:09.486, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guarantee that the editor team, what we've got here now, are going to do some really clickbait title. So there might be some people that come in and see the titles, ethan institutions and Dinero in the title, and they might come across you guys for the first time. Can we start on what px eth is and Apx eth. And then I. I want to use that as a bit of a jumping board to get into IPX, even how that is kind of this huge announcement and why it's so kind of important what you guys have been building, but I just want to kind of set the scene for people who might be coming and called.
00:13:09.638 - 00:13:38.140, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. PXD is an LSD. Right. I think everyone in the market knows how stat works and some of these other products. Right. And the difference with our LSD is we don't naturally inherit any more risks than Steth or Reth would, but we have a yield abstraction model that plays a role in the LSD. You have two tokens, PXE and APX Eth.
00:13:38.140 - 00:14:46.098, Speaker B: All the eth that enters the system is staked with a validator, and then you receive back PX ethan PXE is inherently not receiving any of that Ethereum yield, right? They're forgoing all of that Ethereum yield to the other token, which is APX ETH, which you can single site stake PXE for the reason and incentive people hold PX ETH is because of the Defi opportunities we can create, because of what redacted slash Denero has done on the yield governance side. So we're one of the biggest holders of CVX. We use that to direct all of the yield towards PXE pools on curve. Where Ave NFT holder on velodrome. We use that to direct all of the yield towards a PXE pool on optimism slash velodrome ground table member on Camelot doing the same thing. Or we're one of the main players, and I think by delegates we have one of the most, I think we're one of the biggest controllers of aura through our delegates. So we do the same thing.
00:14:46.098 - 00:15:23.206, Speaker B: On balance, all the deFi opportunities for the more advanced user, akin to like a junior tranche, basically exists for Px eTH, right? And because all of those yield opportunities exist, people are coming in and playing those different games. Therefore going the Ethereum yield to everyone on the APX eth side, and APX eth now is yielding whatever, usually between like eight to 12%. Right. Because there's so many people that stay on the PX eat side, right. And everyone on the APX eat side is inherently sacrificing the defi yield to PxE. Right. So it's the exact same model.
00:15:23.206 - 00:15:42.550, Speaker B: There's no leverage. I know there was a few people that saw the system for the first time and said like, oh, is it Luna? And it's not because the system is collateralized at all times. Right? All you have is like an abstraction of yield, but you're not inherently taking on more risk than you would with a stat or rat. Right?
00:15:44.010 - 00:15:56.634, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. And now, before we get into IPX, how did this kind of, how did this come about? You said you kind of building with, we build with Galaxy for like over a year.
00:15:56.682 - 00:16:01.682, Speaker B: Did you know you, Galaxy came into the picture rather recently.
00:16:01.866 - 00:16:20.950, Speaker A: All right, okay, so you've been, so you've been like, was this always like a vision to kind of go after this side of the market? Or were you guys kind of like, approached, or did you have to kind of get in front of people and pitch? Like, what was that kind of BD side? Like, as much as you can, can't divulge, I suppose.
00:16:20.990 - 00:17:13.650, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I think it's a weird one because, like, we've kind of known these guys for like a while through a bunch of different university clubs and blockchains and school and, like, we've known them and worked with them for a while now. And the, like, we've always been waiting to do something together. And like I was saying in the beginning that there was, you know, not any, there was no opportunity to do so because our glass ceiling was so low. You know, a lot of these guys don't want to play bribe markets and convex and all of this sort of stuff that we were doing. So it would have been foolish for us not to, you know, shoot to dream bigger based on all the, you know, winnings that we had in the past, just on a smaller scale, try and do them on a bigger scale. Right?
00:17:14.870 - 00:17:37.030, Speaker A: Yeah. And now with like. So ipxife is institutional offering with regards to Pyrex ETH. Can you kind of just give people like high level, maybe just high level of what the announcement entails and like, how big of a deal this is for you guys and what it allows, I suppose, the traditional investor to get the hands onto.
00:17:37.450 - 00:18:20.740, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to preface to all of this, I'm not actually allowed to solicit the fund because I'm not a licensed broker, but speaker, I'll speak on it from the dinero terms. Right. One thing that we always wanted to do was be the yield base play of ethereum. And I think that because ethereum yield, like I said, is so decorrelated and so neutral, you have a lot of people who come in and try and commoditize that. Right? So Lido wants you to attach Steth to Ethereum staking yield. Right.
00:18:20.740 - 00:19:04.530, Speaker B: And Eigen Layer, Renzo, all these restaking place think that it's sort of just infrastructure behind like a restaking platform. And people view it in a bunch of different ways. But for us, I think, like, the easiest way for us to come into the market and make a difference that is not doing the stat approach of just being a replacement for wealth is to do what we're doing. Right. And I think that by this time next year, 90% plus of all the TVL in our products will be TVL in the products where a lot of the users don't even know that they're depositing into it. Right. So that could be in the form of branded lsts, which is going to be the next push.
00:19:04.530 - 00:20:56.882, Speaker B: It doesn't make sense to talk about it now, but branded ls tees with layer ones and L2s IPX E with laser and Galaxy, a few other PX USD using a stable coin that's like natively yielding. And there's a bunch of different ways that you can integrate in a theory. I'm staking solution and be there to monetize it without having to shove a specific token down their throats. Because when we launched PXE three realized that, yeah, let's go to scroll, let's go to block last, let's go to linea, whatever. All these different chains that people like, and it's just like, it's very PvP with like the other LST protocols, right? And I think that there's no, like, there's no point in competing because all everyone is doing is it's a race to zero in fees and it's a raise to sanity in terms of yield, right? So I don't know why I would waste time or waste my team's time on like, focusing on, you know, let's go after like kelp eat or one of these other. There's just no point, right, when you can come in and create a more permissionless, customizable sort of offering and then let other people who need specific things out of it come and build a solution on top of that, right? And that's what IPX eth is, right? There's a lot of people that we talked to when we wanted to go out and raise TVL where it's like, oh, it's not compliant and it doesn't fit into our regulatory guidelines and all of these different things. And what we've essentially constructed here on the dinero side is an offering where you have segregated yield, segregated collateral and segregated validator sets.
00:20:56.882 - 00:21:52.280, Speaker B: And because while still producing the same token, and because you can achieve those three things, what you have is an ETH can enter the system from you, or it can enter a system, or it can enter it from a family office, a family office or something. And in the end, both of you guys are receiving PX etH. But your deposit is not the same as another person's deposit in the sense that your deposit is going into the retail validator set. Their deposit is going into the institutional validator set. Now, the nice thing for us is that we can monetize it as a protocol and harvest our yield fee on your $1 of ETH versus his $1 of ETH the exact same way. Because it is the same token that's getting produced. Segregated deposit or segregated collateral in the sense that we recognize all KYC deposits that come in versus non KYC deposits.
00:21:52.280 - 00:22:32.660, Speaker B: Segregated yield in the sense that the segregated validators are producing a different, like, a different amount of yield than the retail side of things. And that's where galaxy plays the part, because galaxy will run all the institutional validators and voila. You know, you have like a completely segregated system within a greater system that is like extremely, extremely compliant, like, compliant enough for us to go out to a lot of these family offices that just want exposure to some digital asset with yield, and it meets all their compliance guidelines. Right.
00:22:33.480 - 00:22:49.220, Speaker A: And with. And does that, the yield performance fee, does that find its way back to stake the narrow, even from the institutional? I think that's massive.
00:22:50.180 - 00:22:52.740, Speaker B: That's huge. Oh, fucking believe me, it was.
00:22:52.820 - 00:22:54.520, Speaker A: I bet that was a pain in the ass.
00:22:58.740 - 00:23:59.120, Speaker B: But it was worth it. We changed the distribution mechanism a little bit. So, like with butterfly, the old token, you would lock it for 16 week intervals, and every epoch, two weeks, we would distribute that Ethan, that was generated on all the products, hidden hand and whatnot, back to the users for participating in governance as an incentive. With SD narrow, we're going towards a more industry standard single side stake solution where there will still be the incentive for you to stake and participate in governance. But the ETH that's getting generated on all things. We're not deprecating hidden hand or anything. All the Ethio that's generated on IPX, ETH, PX, ETH, PX, USD, hidden hand, all these different things that we're doing will be going back in the form of buybacks instead of just a distribution of ETh yield.
00:23:59.120 - 00:24:03.364, Speaker B: Does that make sense?
00:24:03.492 - 00:24:06.160, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. Really nice.
00:24:06.540 - 00:25:06.290, Speaker B: I think the market just like. And the problem is that we couldn't really. It was hard for us to build a liquidity profile on butterfly because, you know, we were doing very good in terms of like, generating yield and revenue and stuff. And, you know, 80% to 80%, 90% at times were like, locked, right? So we couldn't do any volume, you know, like, lock it and hold it. And, you know, this is, this is a different story. But I think the single side stake model, there's a lot of, like, people that, like, look down on it, but I also look down on it, but I think I realize the. The value in terms of, you know, like I said, breaking through these, like, low glass ceilings, making little changes, like, here and there, help you in terms of, you know, scaling and doing things that you need to do in order to, like, play the game of like, you know, running a defi project.
00:25:06.630 - 00:25:10.974, Speaker A: Yeah. What about. Is it like a one to 2000 split? Is that right?
00:25:11.142 - 00:25:20.290, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. That stuff is like I gave you. The main reason we're doing the conversion is because we have to be more serious and stuff. And then there's a few cosmetic changes that people.
00:25:22.870 - 00:25:31.616, Speaker A: So can you expand further on what Galaxy and laser digital's kind of position in this whole thing is just to kind of.
00:25:31.648 - 00:25:59.926, Speaker B: Yeah. The best way to think of it is that we are the service provider of the Ethereum tech. Right, of the LST. Right. Galaxy is the service provider for the validators, and laser is the one actually offering the product to accredited investors. So that's the easiest way to explain it. So laser came to us.
00:25:59.926 - 00:26:14.050, Speaker B: They wanted to white label it essentially for an institutional product. We built that hand in hand with them. We offloaded the validator side of things, validator operations to Galaxy. And it's this three pronged approach, essentially, to.
00:26:14.750 - 00:26:30.560, Speaker A: Yeah, and when could the. So what does the user generally look like for someone who's purchasing that? But if they kind of on the books with Galaxy, they can just purchase it directly from them and then it's all handled on the back end by you guys and.
00:26:31.860 - 00:27:14.410, Speaker B: Okay, well, first of all, not galaxy laser. Right? So laser digital asset management. Right, is the crypto arm of Nomura securities. Right. And all the crypto clients that come in through that investment bank are dealing exactly with laser digital. We will be onboarded onto, like, a few different platforms, which I can't disclose because it would be soliciting. But any of these clients that are onboarded, if you're RA broker, whatever, high net worth, individual family office, if you're looking to come into the product or the laser, Nomura sales teams identifies you as a potential client.
00:27:14.410 - 00:27:37.140, Speaker B: It's as simple as a phone call. Euros and other accepted currencies come in. It's a private OTC between laser and their counterparties to get the ETH in the system. And that is the KYC deposit that comes in, and then we can satisfy instant withdraws and stuff like that.
00:27:37.680 - 00:28:07.460, Speaker A: All right, sweet. So can you give me a little look behind the curtain of, like, what is the. Obviously, we've had Ethereum ETF a lot of conversations going on there. It's been like, top of mind shift for everyone. What is the appetite for ETH? And in particular, what are the conversations around ETH staking with regards to a yield? Because we know traditional finance loves a yield, but I'm just a little degenerate hobbit that sits behind this laptop slinging shit coins. All day. So I don't get to see, like, what the big fellas are talking about.
00:28:07.460 - 00:28:12.640, Speaker A: So what's kind of been your experience over the past year or so, speaking to these kind of people?
00:28:14.370 - 00:28:16.630, Speaker B: That they're a lot more degenerate than you think.
00:28:18.010 - 00:28:19.510, Speaker A: There's still hope for us.
00:28:21.370 - 00:29:08.414, Speaker B: Actually. You know, the thing is that a lot of them know exactly what's going on, right? All right, they know about restaking. They know about Ethereum yield. You know, this billions and billions of dollars of TVL that shows up on eigen layer and all these different things doesn't come out of nowhere, but there's hundreds or billions of dollars that knows about it, that doesn't show up on Eigen layer out of nowhere. That is just completely sidelined because of the lack of rails. Right? And IPX ETH is a rail in the sense that it meets all the compliance guidelines that all these guys, potential investors, want and need. It opens the door for them to come in and play the game that they're already very familiar with.
00:29:08.414 - 00:29:53.136, Speaker B: Right. I'd say, like, a lot of the people backing this product at Genesis either have ETH on the books that they got somehow, some way. They have a mandate now to have digital assets on the book, but everyone knows about it. You know, there's not, like, I think we're past the stage of people like, oh, this is interesting. Let me explore this. You know, if you're coming to someone and you're saying, which I didn't do, I haven't been soliciting the fund, but if someone comes to them and says, there's this ethereum yielding solution, you don't have to explain Ethereum yield to these people anymore. I think everyone knows about it, and everyone's sitting on their hands because they're just waiting for the right rail to enter the system.
00:29:53.136 - 00:30:22.026, Speaker B: It's much easier to go through a due diligence process if onboarding into it is as simple as, you know, buying another Nomura fund or something, right? This is a process that people understand. You know, they don't understand, you know, go on metamask and, you know, check the smart contract and all these things. They know, oh, I called this broker, and he does this, and, you know, I understand this. Right? So that's what it boils down to, really.
00:30:22.218 - 00:31:12.448, Speaker A: Yeah. What I think is really interesting about this, I think you guys are the first people to crack it where others have kind of tried it, but in a different setting. I think Aave had, like, Aave Ark, if I'm not mistaken, and there's been a couple of people being like, oh, let's build institutional blockchains. But it's. Then it's just like, well, who's going to come interact on Ave Arc's private, private Dapp when there's no one else? It'll just be complete PvP nightmare. But this makes sense to, to have that as like a siloed product because it is kind of a PVE situation where you generate yield from the overriding network. What do you think? And obviously you've kind of, you guys have laid your hand here, but do you think institutional rails have to go that way as opposed to.
00:31:12.448 - 00:31:22.570, Speaker A: I know we spoke about Rwas kind of going the reverse way, but do you see this as the way that, um, more kind of institutions that are on board it, particularly on chain, because.
00:31:23.190 - 00:32:03.698, Speaker B: Like, well, I think everyone has a, I think everyone exists like in a different place on the risk curve. Right? Yeah. Majority of people are probably happy with, with just spot eth exposure, right. There was spot ETF, but it's about, but it's about finding the niches that people really want, right. I think that there's a very large amount of people that have eth out in the books already that don't need a spot ETF that are interested in ethereum yield. This benchmark rate of ethereum inflation. I think a lot of people are interested in that.
00:32:03.698 - 00:32:25.850, Speaker B: And it's not people in crypto. They don't get out of bed for two points, three points. But this is a big number. And I think that whether it's 90% of people are interested in the yield, or even 10% of people, 10% of these institutions interested in the yield is like $100 billion market in and of itself. Right?
00:32:28.070 - 00:32:43.824, Speaker A: Are you having a lot of interest with people wanting to come build on top of PXE? Because I can think of about three different kind of structured products or cash and carry that you could build on top of it. Myself.
00:32:43.992 - 00:33:24.296, Speaker B: I mean, um, look like the crypto market is like, I have no, like, envy towards any of the other projects that like have a ton of integrations that like roll in and stuff. I think we have what we need in terms of tax liquidity, basic money markets, all of these things. But it's a slow grind for us, right. We're not going to, like, we could have very easily, like, had this opportunity come to us and been like, fuck, butterfly, let's just do a new token. And there's a lot of people who did do that, man.
00:33:24.328 - 00:33:41.980, Speaker A: There's lots of v two. There's lots of v two tokens happened, and there's lots of v. Two tokens coming where they've just wiped the floor clean with their vesting terms and not just a nice facelift and a nice change of utility, a complete vamp of supply and vesting and shit show, really. But.
00:33:43.840 - 00:34:00.808, Speaker B: No, but I mean, like, even some of the LRT projects and LST projects, just same faces that are just, you know, doing it under a new thing, and they have, you know, 30% of tokens to give out and stuff. You don't have that advantage. Well, it's either an advantage or a.
00:34:00.824 - 00:34:03.560, Speaker A: Disadvantage, depending on short term advantageous.
00:34:03.590 - 00:34:04.804, Speaker B: Yeah, we.
00:34:04.852 - 00:34:07.720, Speaker A: We know how this. It's the same thing.
00:34:08.340 - 00:34:32.174, Speaker B: We're seeing, like, money, like, fly out of eigen layer now, and now there's competitors, and it's not going to. Whatever. I don't. I don't care. Right. Like, for us, it's like, you know, we know what we do good, and we know who we can service, and we know what our market is. And now the good thing is that it's billions and billions and billions of dollars that we can service, not just, you know, $10 million or something.
00:34:32.174 - 00:35:20.012, Speaker B: Right. And all that to say that there's more integrations on the horizon, whether it's for PX eth itself or for IPX ETH or for, you know, these, like, branded PX ETH releases that we'll be doing, which will operate the same as IPX eTh without the KYC and stuff. Right. So stay on the horizon. Like, we have a ton of stuff that we have to, like, get out the door. We have a ton of stuff that we have to get out the door that that'll be, like, very sustainable and very high ev in terms of, you know, growing and scaling PXE to the point where, you know, it becomes very nice collateral for PX USD. Right.
00:35:20.012 - 00:35:22.440, Speaker B: And then. And then it's on to the stable coin.
00:35:23.280 - 00:35:38.060, Speaker A: Yeah, a couple of quick ones on. How did the migration go in the end? Was it a pain in the ass? Did you want to get it done? Did you have to wait till all this announcement was ready? Like, was everyone happy in the end, or have you still got people asking questions in discord how to migrate?
00:35:39.040 - 00:35:55.006, Speaker B: I think everyone. I think everyone was able to do it relatively easy, actually, compared to the first migration. Well, the first one. The first migration wasn't really a migration. It was more like a stop free basis type thing. Yeah. This one was like an actual migration.
00:35:55.006 - 00:36:02.290, Speaker B: So you'd assume there'd be more questions. But actually it was fairly straightforward. I don't think. I think we learned from the first time.
00:36:03.630 - 00:36:12.770, Speaker A: And you guys continue to hire. I've seen Defi Dev and I can't remember who was. Who did you find for BD in the end?
00:36:14.310 - 00:36:15.166, Speaker B: Robert Chang.
00:36:15.238 - 00:36:19.740, Speaker A: Yeah, so we continue to expand the team.
00:36:21.320 - 00:36:59.400, Speaker B: I think we, as of like, this exact moment, I don't think we have any hires open. If someone really cool comes knocking, I think we're open to it. We still want to be relatively conservative with burn, but I think we're in a stage where we decided to, like, you know, on the brinks of this. On the brinks of this announcement. It made sense to, like, up the burn a little bit just because, like, we need people to, like, learn about this shit, like. Right. And we needed more hands on deck, especially on, like, the growth side of things.
00:36:59.400 - 00:37:20.910, Speaker B: Right. So we were able to tap Asia a little bit. First asian hire with Robert Dave is like a familiar face to a lot of people have, like, the original BD team focus more on, like, IPX. So we, we have everything, like, really situated right now in terms of the team, but I don't think we need to scale burn more than we just did.
00:37:22.890 - 00:37:34.390, Speaker A: So is there anything I might have missed that because there's a lot to unpack and I'm sure you've got a million different things raised around your head, but there's anything, like, really pressing that you want to get out, then the floor is yours.
00:37:35.430 - 00:38:03.130, Speaker B: No, my new thing is to be, like, whenever I talk to people, my new thing is to, like, bang my head against the wall before the call starts so that I know not to, like, go off topic and talk about a million things, but rather get the point across that, like, IPX eth is based, we just announced it's launching this week sometime. It's launching very soon and. Yeah, you should go check it out.
00:38:03.510 - 00:38:10.990, Speaker A: There you go. Well, I think you delivered that extremely well. You should be used to it by now. You've been on about 25 times and you probably come on another 25.
00:38:11.070 - 00:38:12.090, Speaker B: Missing Jedi.
00:38:13.550 - 00:38:26.050, Speaker A: Yeah, he's off hounding people for sponsorship and advertisement placement conferences. Any coming up? Any going to. Towards the end of the year, are you going to be in Asia?
00:38:27.820 - 00:38:58.260, Speaker B: Maybe. I was looking at KVW token, obviously. Yeah, I think I'm gonna Defcon. Yeah, I think, like, that time will be cool because we'll have more stuff to push also, like, it should be closer to, like, bear season. So I'm gonna, like, I'm basically gonna line it up with whatever. If you see me at, like, a conference in Asia, it's because bear chain's about to come out, so I want to be, like, very close to that.
00:38:59.160 - 00:39:04.360, Speaker A: Yeah, we've got a side event in Bangkok, so I'll get you down on that.
00:39:04.480 - 00:39:15.700, Speaker B: Yeah? Yeah. I like to know which ones I end up, like, pulling trigger on, but right now, I'm done with conferences. I'm happy I skipped out on Brussels. Sounded like a nightmare. Yeah, and a couple others, so.
00:39:16.200 - 00:39:36.866, Speaker A: Yeah, all right, perfect. Thank you so much, mate. And open invite whenever you want to come back on. And congrats on everything you've been doing. I was buzzing to see it from the sidelines, and you guys are very deserving of it happening to you, so and long. May I continue? And, yeah, we'll see you next time you come on for the 25th installment of sami mates grant.
00:39:37.058 - 00:39:38.190, Speaker B: Appreciate it.
