00:00:00.240 - 00:00:36.906, Speaker A: I think that at a high level, people want to trade attention, and, like, the modality for that can change. I think in 2021, 2022, there was, like, people trading attention on both, like, defi yield, incentive, and tokens, as well as pfps. But pfps were, like, in my opinion, the highest form of just, like, trading social attention. And I think people have kind of discovered that, like, meme coins are just better at trading attention than pfps are. They're more liquid, they're more accessible. They're easy to buy and sell. They're easier to buy and sell.
00:00:36.906 - 00:00:44.410, Speaker A: So I think the market is kind of, like, showing its maturity in a sense of, like, we used to trade social attention like this, and now we're trading social attention like.
