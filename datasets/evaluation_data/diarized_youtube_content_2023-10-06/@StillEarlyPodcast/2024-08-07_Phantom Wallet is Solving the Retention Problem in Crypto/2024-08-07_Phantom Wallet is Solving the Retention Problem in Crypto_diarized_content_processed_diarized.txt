00:00:00.320 - 00:00:36.486, Speaker A: A lot of people talk about, like, the onboarding problem in crypto. I think the more interesting problem and the harder problem to solve and the more impactful problem is the retention problem. Like the idea that you already have users, they already find ways to get crypto in their wallets. How do we keep them coming back and, like, finding interesting things to do? And we found that a very few percent of users, you know, early on in phantoms launch were actually interacting with dapps. Most people were just holding coins and sending it back to exchanges or to their friends, whatever, and they weren't interacting with dapps. But the few that were interacting with Dapps were the core users that stuck it out and were coming back every month, regardless of price. Action, finding new things to do on their own.
00:00:36.486 - 00:00:55.320, Speaker A: And so where we sit, we really think we can play a role in helping introduce the broader set of users to new things to do in crypto. Also help those power users find the next useful thing, next great trade for them to make, the next app for them to interact with. You name it. That's a big focus for us.
