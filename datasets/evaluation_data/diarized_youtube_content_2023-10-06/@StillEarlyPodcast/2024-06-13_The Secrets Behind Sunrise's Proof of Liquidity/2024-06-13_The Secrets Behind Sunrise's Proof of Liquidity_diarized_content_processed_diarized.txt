00:00:00.320 - 00:00:05.394, Speaker A: I think I might know who that project is, but I can't say anything because I think they announce it tomorrow.
00:00:05.694 - 00:00:09.390, Speaker B: Introducing data availability sampling technology you've mentioned.
00:00:09.462 - 00:00:13.014, Speaker A: Slightly on the rise token. What can you tell us?
00:00:13.134 - 00:00:17.958, Speaker B: Uniqueness of sunrise is that sunrise has a fee abstraction mechanism.
00:00:18.046 - 00:00:29.234, Speaker C: Quick one, nothing here is financial advice. It's for entertainment and educational purposes only. Always do your own research or speak to a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Enjoy the episode and like and subscribe.
00:00:35.504 - 00:00:56.570, Speaker A: All right, welcome back to another episode of Bury Mets podcast. And today we've got the gang from sunrise on who, as the protocol has really really been, piqued my interest lately. And I'm pretty sure everyone's going to be as excited as I am about it. So today we've got you. So how are you doing, sir? Everything all okay? You guys must be extremely busy at the minute, so thanks for taking the time out to come chat with us today.
00:00:56.712 - 00:00:58.674, Speaker B: Yeah, everything is okay today.
00:00:59.614 - 00:01:07.954, Speaker A: Awesome, awesome. So can you kind of fill us in with a little brief background on yourself and then what you guys are building at sunrise?
00:01:08.974 - 00:01:56.458, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Sunrise is a data availability layer specialized for pro liquidity. I have to explain what is probably liquidity very shortly. Many blockchains, especially public blockchains, have a civil resistance algorithms. For example, bitcoin adopts proof of work to prevent from spamming transactions by utilizing the mining mechanism. And in ethereum proof stake mechanism is adopted to prevent from transaction spamming and so on. However, in the prohop stake there is no positive external effect for the ecosystem.
00:01:56.458 - 00:02:24.754, Speaker B: However, in the prohop liquidity users have to provide the liquidity. In the liquidity pool it is similar to uniswap decentralized exchanges and to get a voting power you have to provide a liquidity and it leads to the positive external effect for ecosystem. And that is a basic idea of probability quality and we apply that technology for data availability layer.
00:02:26.174 - 00:02:43.254, Speaker A: Awesome. So can you kind of give people who they might have heard the term data availability, they must have seen quite a lot about the kind of modular landscape. But can you kind of give us a high level of what data availability is and why it's so topical at present?
00:02:43.634 - 00:03:49.514, Speaker B: Sure. All blockchain consists of four layers. Typically. The first is execution layer and second is settlement layer, third is consensus layer and the fourth is data availability layer. In data availability layer it assures that transaction data is surely published among the network and it sure that no one cannot withhold the transaction data. If Malzia's person withhold the transaction data, there might be a possibility of attacking the network and leaving the user's fund. However, by assuring that no one cannot withhold the transaction data, the security will be guaranteed and data availability layer or modular data availability layer works for that.
00:03:50.814 - 00:04:04.924, Speaker A: Awesome. And so why does this matter for the roll up business model? And why are so many rollups now looking for external and modular data availability?
00:04:06.304 - 00:05:45.964, Speaker B: Sure, to accredit a roll up, of course it requires the width layer. However, currently Ethereum upgraded to adopt the EIP 4844 so called prototype sharding and developers can utilize the blob space of the Ethereum to scale up the roll ups and compress the cost of running data. Very delay compress the cost of running rollups. However, there is a room to improve the data availability layer scalability by introducing data availability sampling technology in all the blockchains like Celestia Ave and so on, all are adopting data availability sampling technologies and in this mechanism light node it is completely different from full node can verify that the transaction data has been published without downloading the old data of the blocks. Only downloading the header of the blocks and the small size of the share of data, they can verify that the transaction data has been published. Surely, and the data availability sampling technology plays a role of helping the scalability of the data wave layer.
00:05:46.704 - 00:05:59.834, Speaker A: Yeah, and is there a like how much does it look like from a cost saving perspective as well as the scalability, is it like ten times the saving 100 times? Is it getting any higher than that?
00:06:00.414 - 00:06:42.254, Speaker B: Before the introduction of protodank sharding, some people say that by introducing Celestia for arbitram, for example, they can compress the cost about wait 20 times and the situation varied after the upgrade for tank sharing. Now however, Ethereum protunctioning doesn't have data availability sampling yet and there is still room to compress the cost to run the roll ups.
00:06:43.034 - 00:07:04.244, Speaker A: So when a roll up or an l two is submitting data to an old DA layer like yourselves or celestia, what is happening from a transactional standpoint there are you paying in native gas? What's the actual transaction that's going on under the hood?
00:07:05.304 - 00:08:26.078, Speaker B: Okay, so let's say I am a roll up operator and I'm using summarized data ability later. Then the sequencer of the roll ups collect the transaction of L2 from the L2 users. Then the operator bundle the transactions and post transaction data to the data aware published data published to the data aware. At that point the legacy operator have to pay a certain amount of gas fee into data availability layer and typically if I use celestia for data availability layer, I have to pay TIA token to Celestia network and if I use avail I have to pay avail token. And if I use eigenvalue I have to use ether token or something like that in sunrise. Of course, user Lias developers or liars operators can choose that I pay rise token to sunrise. They can choose that.
00:08:26.078 - 00:08:45.053, Speaker B: However, the uniqueness of sunrise is that sunrise has a fee obstruction mechanism and Liat operators don't need to pay the explicit fee only by providing the liquidity in the liquidity pool on sunrise.
00:08:46.633 - 00:08:59.973, Speaker A: Nice. Love that. So where did this crazy idea of proof of liquidity and an old da layer come from? And why is it such a good synergy of two new emerging technologies?
00:09:00.873 - 00:10:16.516, Speaker B: Yeah, when I was reviewing the architecture of Verrochain I noticed that it is vero chain's. There is a core wait. When I was revenue a version mechanism, I found that there is an ethereum virtual machine in the central ecosystem. They developed Polaris EVM at first, and then recently they announced that they developed a PCOM kit to integrate the Ethereum virtual machine to their ecosystem. So the blockchain ecosystem cannot be separated from ethereum virtual machine and prohab liquidity mechanism is also densely connected with ethereum virtual machine ecosystem. So smart contract and so on. However, by utilizing the IBC interoperability popular in cosmos ecosystem, we also can apply the liquidity or swapping function with interchange, not only for ethereum virtual machines.
00:10:16.516 - 00:11:53.694, Speaker B: So furthermore, recently a rollkit that is a software development kit to develop rollups with Cosmos SDK style can support IBC interoperability by utilizing the specific type of data availability layer like Celestia and so on. Then if we, if we combine the probable liquidity stable resistance and data abbreviated layer, the roll ups that utilize probably data aberrant layer can access to the liquidity of the probable liquidity liquidity pool and similarly can swap tokens through many blockchains only with one transaction. And it can realize the asynos ux even if it is a multi chain in the roll up ecosystem. The fragmentation of liquidity is a very big problem and still big problem and user experience of machines very bad. However, we can utilize the liquidity gather in the liquidity pooling or prohibit liquidity to solve that. And at the same time we can enhance the security economic security of the data availability layer by introducing the civil resistance of the liquidity.
00:11:54.674 - 00:12:12.314, Speaker A: Awesome. That's really really smart design. I really like that. And what assets will be accepted as proof for proof of liquidity would you expect this to be a small amount of assets first and then you kind of expand? Or have you got any ideas around that?
00:12:12.974 - 00:13:15.610, Speaker B: Yeah, at first we will prepare the certain types of the liquidity pool and we will detach the governance gate of the pool curriculum. At first, we will of course support the token that can be transferred with IBC interoperability. And at that time, at the same time we can support a token that has been transferred with Axelr. Because Axelr is now supporting ERC 20 tokens in some ethereum virtual machine, blockchains and transfer tokens can be transferred with ICS 20. That is token transfer protocol in Ibis ecosystem. So our sunrise blockchain, it can or manage the balances of the tokens that are transferred through axillar. So we can create a pool of the token transferred by accelera.
00:13:15.610 - 00:13:29.494, Speaker B: For example, we can create a pool of rapid ether or shib coin, pepe coin, any token made with either ERC 20 interface.
00:13:30.094 - 00:13:53.394, Speaker A: Nice. And so when I was doing some research on you guys, obviously you have sister project, sister product and I was just wondering if there's any kind of crossover there. I really like the idea of what you guys said on in your documentation of like yield and modularity. I'd love to just kind of pick your brain on how the dynamics of the two work together.
00:13:54.974 - 00:15:25.754, Speaker B: Yeah. To sustain the incentive of providing the liquidity in the liquidity pool. On summarize, we will distribute the incentive incentive token for the liquidity providers by integrating the mechanism that is improved through many protocols like car finance and Olympus Dow and so on. We introduced the mechanism similar to ve for the index cross and 33 mechanism, to make people more incentivized to provide a liquidity for a profitable pool and concentrate the incentive token to the profitable tokens. In that case, we need to improve the user experience of providing the liquidity to enhance the tb of the electricity pool and, and then it leads to the economic security of the prohibited liquidity.
00:15:27.454 - 00:15:49.824, Speaker A: Awesome. So with sunrise, is the kind of target roll ups more cosmos based with their sovereign chains, is it more looking at the l two space? Is it for everyone? Is there an ideal kind of roll up that you guys would love to be able to kind of work alongside?
00:15:50.564 - 00:17:39.034, Speaker B: Yeah, currently IBC compatibility is supported for the sovereign roll ups that is made with a roll kit. However, thanks to the external ecosystem like yeah, I can raise some name of the external project radio bar. Typically other external ecosystem are trying to support IBC for L2s on Ethereum or for Solana or the virtual machine to support to support the IBC compatible interoperability. At that time, we can of course access their token to the liquidity port on sunrise and they can access to the liquidity after the integration of such a software development kit or interoperability compatibility. However, currently. Wait, sorry, sorry. I'm thinking rocket is supporting IBC and UBM roll ups can be supported in the future and blockchains can be supported.
00:17:39.034 - 00:18:27.894, Speaker B: Okay, okay. Let me answer from the beginning. Okay, yeah. At first the roll kit is supported to be compatible with IBC. Hence we can very easily integrate the roll kit roll ups and they can access to the liquidity in the sunrise with IPC. However, wait. Furthermore, other external ecosystems are trying to integrate IBC for non rollkit roll ups, for example op stack or polygon, CDK and so on.
00:18:27.894 - 00:19:02.214, Speaker B: After the integration of that, we can support the IVC connection between sunrise and such layouts roll ups and they can access to the liquidity service. Hence there is a synergy of utilizing prohibited liquidity resistance, economic security of SaNRIs data availability, and at the same time to use liquidity. In some ways we can expand the support for any type of SDK for liatudes.
00:19:02.774 - 00:19:30.274, Speaker A: Nice. And so there seems to be two other extremely, extremely kind of trending aligned protocols that you guys seem to be very, very close to, and that is berichain and celestia. I'd love to pick your brain on the idea of the barrichain alignment and then following that, the celestial alignment and what that kind of means to you guys.
00:19:32.034 - 00:20:19.644, Speaker B: Here. In the version one summarize, the mechanism of data availability is compatible with Celestia and we will distribute the certain amount of airdrop for stakeholders of Celestia's Ti token and also for liquid staking tokens of Celestia, for example Milky Way and slice. Furthermore, we are collaborating with a burching team to expand the knowledge of rob liquidity. We have same goal, to expand and enlighten people to know more about the benefit of the probe liquidity.
00:20:20.584 - 00:20:44.014, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I love both of those teams. So it's a great kind of trifecta of protocols there. And you've mentioned slightly on the rise token. What can you tell us? What are the dynamics? What are the sinks? Is there any token flows? I'm pretty sure everyone listening is wanting to know a lot more about the rise token.
00:20:44.714 - 00:22:09.594, Speaker B: Yeah, very interesting point in probability is the very interesting point in proof of liquidity mechanism in sunrise and blockchain is that there are two tokens. The first one is non transferable governance token that can be retrieved only by providing the liquidity in the liquidity pool. The second token is a free token that is transferable and furthermore the non transferable governance token can be converted into the feed token and users can use the feed token to send a transaction in the network. Sunrise or parachain. Rice token is similar to para token in Parachain and v rise token is similar to the BCT token in blockchain where we can explain the relation between vrayz and raise token with the analogy of payroll token and PZT token. When the user pay riot token as a transaction fee or a certain portion of the rights token will be burnt, it will lead to the sustainable.
00:22:13.914 - 00:22:14.322, Speaker A: We.
00:22:14.378 - 00:22:32.654, Speaker B: Believe that it leads to the sustainability of the incentive of holding a token rise token and keeping the value of the rise token. You believe?
00:22:33.874 - 00:23:02.954, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. So like lots of utility for that. Anyone who's tapping into your old da layer is going to be kind of using the token, then it's going to portion of that's going to get burned. So yeah, additionally utility like that. And so what kind of, what stage of development are you guys at? Are you kind of like yeah, filmy and what stage of development are you at? Did you do any form of raise? Like what's the kind of lay of the land for you guys at the minute?
00:23:03.294 - 00:23:49.724, Speaker B: Yeah. Currently we have an internal testnet to experiment the core functionalities for data availability and now we are also working for publishing the Testnet for the functionality of liquidity pool and so on. At the time when we record this podcast, we are now preparing for publishing the public testnet for making people able to try out allocative functionalities.
00:23:51.384 - 00:24:20.954, Speaker A: Nice, nice. So is there a big push for business development and collaboration? And how do you make kind of sure that people, one, are aware of you guys in comparison to competitors and two, how do you kind of convince them? And what are the kind of unique selling points of going with you guys over the few other alt Deere layers that are kind of on the market? Currently?
00:24:21.614 - 00:26:08.104, Speaker B: Sure. Currently we in the business development side, we are talking with many roll up as a service providers because it is anticipated that many Elliott developers will use roll up as their services to mitigate the cost of building roll ups L2 blockchains. So we are talking with Rus providers to support SARS as a data availability layer. Furthermore, we are talking with many projects to do co marketing who has a similar goal to expand knowledge and so on. And we also are getting strong support from japanese companies because I am from Japan and I have are setting a presence in the japanese community and I got some support from japanese companies. And furthermore, just a moment, okay. Furthermore, we are trying to scale up the data availability in the current mechanism, current design of Alti, all including the block data into the block data of the blockchain.
00:26:08.104 - 00:27:31.774, Speaker B: Of course it is. Of course it is a way to guarantee the data availability, develop data, contain the block. But for in the perspective of expanding the use cases of data availability, not only for layered data availability but also for storage usage of the decentralized applications, we need a lot more scalability for data availability and typically zero, zero labs are trying to apply the data availability technology for decentralized artificial intelligence. And similar to that idea, we are trying to offload the block data off chain while we are still guaranteeing the availability of the data with a correct graphic way. And then it, we believe that it will lead to the application for many other usages of the data availability technology.
00:27:32.874 - 00:27:56.744, Speaker A: Awesome. And do you think obviously there's been a lot of new emerging, new emerging trains, a lot of new l two s, l three s, even beyond that, do you think we're still in the early days of that and do you think we see much more rapid expansion of new emerging chains and l two s and additional roll ups?
00:27:57.484 - 00:29:49.608, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. We believe that the modular expansion is still in early stage and there is still not many roll up as a services and the developer experiences is still worse than developing a vanilla smart contract. However, we believe that only with the smart contract there is a limitation to express the, there is still a limitation to express the flexible logic only with smart contracts to realize the flexible logic and for example usage of the larger storages, we need decentralized application realized with a sovereign network, typically sovereign roll apps or smart contract roll and so on. So only the smart contract. There is a limitation to express the logics of of the central applications. In that time we need more, we need more friendly developers experiences to develop roll ups and legal two s and at that time lag developers have to use the data availability layer to publish the transaction data and they at that time modular ecosystem will get a huge transaction, will get a huge traction that is anticipated by the early adopter of.
00:29:49.656 - 00:30:09.734, Speaker A: Modular ecosystem and for a roll up to integrate with you guys. How easy is that? Is it a heavy lift from your end? Is there a lot of developer work to be done? Like how easy can you make that for people that would like to integrate you guys?
00:30:10.994 - 00:31:18.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard that some projects are working to realize the data availability aggregator. So it is an idea like creating an adapter for the data availability and users can choose which data availability to use very easily and they can switch very easily or they can guarantee a fail safe mechanism. For example, if one data availability of blockchain halts in the time the substitutional data availability layer will be used during the housing time of the first data availability layer. By adopting such a data wave adapter, we think we can help the easy integration of our databuty layer. So we are also talking with such a project to expand our database.
00:31:19.404 - 00:31:45.352, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I might know who that project is, but I can't say anything because I think they announce it tomorrow. That's right, I'll confirm off air. I don't want to give anything away. Is there anything you want to leave the audience with? Where can they find you guys? Where would you like them to come check you out? And what should they be aware of in the short term?
00:31:45.548 - 00:32:02.084, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Today we are announcing a lot of news in our community, so please check out our discord server and don't forget to check the latest announcements.
