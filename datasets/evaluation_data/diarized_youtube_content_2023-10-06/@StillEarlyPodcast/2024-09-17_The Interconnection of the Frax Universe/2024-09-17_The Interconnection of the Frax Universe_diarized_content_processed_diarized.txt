00:00:00.240 - 00:00:56.025, Speaker A: People that are listening to this like later might not know but like we see a lot of other projects currently in the works building their own chains and roll ups that they haven't announced. Like I'm not going to say their names but there's like 3, 4, 5 off the top of my head now that you know there's like two of them in Q4 of this year there's another really big exchange that's going to launch something, you know, similar to base. I can't say it for lack of, you know, I don't want to give give their release but trust me when I say we're very confident that it's going to be a world and I think that you know, FRAX still will continue to go up the ranks and we have to play the long game so that's basically how we think about it. And, and the last thing I'll say is like everything in the frax, I call it a universe now rather than just an ecosystem because we have kind of the full stack of chain application, you know with frax finance and asset issuance is governed and secured by fxs.
