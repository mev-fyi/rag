00:00:00.200 - 00:00:31.498, Speaker A: Alright, just a quick one before we get going. So please don't take anything you hear in today's episode as financial advice. Please speak to a trained professional if you do wish to participate in markets. Crypto is inherently risky and you will lose all your money, particularly if you listen to us for financial direction. So enough of that. Please give us a, like, subscribe, enjoy the show, and see you next time. Alright, welcome back to another episode of still early, and it certainly is still early for August.
00:00:31.498 - 00:00:36.254, Speaker A: We've dragged him out of bed at 07:00 in the morning. Sorry, sir. How are you doing?
00:00:37.274 - 00:00:38.050, Speaker B: Doing good.
00:00:38.122 - 00:00:48.174, Speaker A: Before we get to it, just like, as I say, let's just set the scene a little bit. What's kind of taking up your mind? Shared, fill people in what you're kind of working on at the minute. And then I say, we'll just see where the conversation takes us.
00:00:48.674 - 00:01:15.686, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. What's filling up my mind at the minute? That's an interesting way to frame it. I mean, I've been in crypto as a dev since 2017. Kind of worked all over the place. Worked in Defi, worked in Icos a little bit back in the day. That was funny. Mostly just making contracts for people who are trying to launch stuff, you know, and been doing NFT stuff since 2021 mostly.
00:01:15.686 - 00:02:10.572, Speaker B: And so right now, NFT market kind of sucks. I think everybody knows. Um, and I got into like trading meme coins during when the craze was kind of warming up and that's turned out awesome, funny enough. So, um, basically I kind of saw this 404 thing pop up with Pandora and I've kind of been diving heavy into how do we take this and kind of make this the next NFT thing? Because I think it, it plays on a couple of different things. I mean, a liquidity is just good to have, you know, it, you know, there's a lot of positive things about being able to sell when you want to or buy when you went to or whatever. So I think, you know, like, we can get into that really deep. But that's kind of been, the big thing lately is, is four hundred four s and meme coins and meme culture.
00:02:10.572 - 00:02:43.274, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people who know me from the last couple years also know me as somebody who's, like, really passionate in the art space. And it kind of sucks in a way because I think that that's, that's not going great for a lot of people. Funny and not funny enough. But however you want to say it, like, it's just that part of the market, I think, maybe comes later in the cycle. So I've kind of been, I still love the art stuff, but it's definitely not on the forefront of anything really right now. So it's kind of weird.
00:02:44.474 - 00:03:52.554, Speaker A: Yeah, the, so the 404 stuff is super, super interesting to me. I mean, as soon as it launched, it's quite funny, actually, me, Dan and Jerry, who people might know as Jedi, we were sat on a team meeting and we were supposed to be doing like, all right, what, what content's coming through this week? Have we got any sponsors that we need to kind of fulfill our end of the bargain for? And, like, nobody talks for like two minutes. And I was like, is everyone else buying pandora? And all three of us were at the desk and we're like, yeah, yeah, we're all buying it as well because it kind of clicked on the meeting when we were talking through and I was just like, wow, this is, you know, one of those potentially game changing innovations that came to the industry and they don't happen as off the cuff as that usually. So when that launched and I kind of, like, did, like, the basics of digging into it, I was like, oh, my God, this is, this is, this is really, really great. Do you want to give, like, people like, you might be coming at this a little bit, call, like, high level of what the whole idea around ERc 404s are, and then I suppose we can just geek out over that for a little bit.
00:03:53.414 - 00:04:28.344, Speaker B: Yeah. First and foremost, it's not a real erc, so they call it that. And it's a little cheeky because it's like, we can make our own erc. We don't have to talk to you. So, like, I found that kind of funny in a way, but it also, like, it's interesting because what it basically does is it combines the idea of, like, an NFT and a token. I mean, if you're a super nerd, you're going to be like, t in NFT stands for token. But you know what I mean? It's like, there's like liquidity with ERC 20s where you can just go in, it's fungible, you can trade it on a Dex NFTs.
00:04:28.344 - 00:05:24.806, Speaker B: Normally you're relying on there to be bids on a marketplace like blur or something like this to actually be able to sell or listings to be able to buy. If you think about, like, meme coins in particular, like, I've been doing everything on avalanche for a while. Started on Eth, obviously, a long time ago, but been on avalanche for the last couple years mostly. So the meme coin, like, sort of method of launching a meme coin on avalanche has been to basically pair some avalanche with the meme coin and then put it in the liquidity pool and then burn it. So you have this permanent lp there forever that you can trade against. And so essentially with the 404, you can have, like, in our case, like, we have a PFP collection that I worked with an artist and we did, and we burn the liquidity. So, you know, you can trade this PFP collection in the same way you trade a meme coin or if you want, because it's also an NFT, you can trade it like, on an NFT marketplace.
00:05:24.806 - 00:05:52.094, Speaker B: So, like, that's kind of the fundamental breakdown of what's going on, is trade it as a token. Traded as an NFT. No, no. I had a friend yelling at me the whole time, like, you should give this. I was like, I don't know. And then that was, that was my indicator, like, okay, I screwed that one up. Now we're not messing up.
00:05:52.094 - 00:07:55.194, Speaker B: So it. Okay, so first of all, that's really cool that I think you're the first person I've heard articulate that that way. But I've been sensing the same thing is like, this. This is attracting a mixture of, like, yeah, defi people, people who like to trade tokens and stuff, but also the NFT people. And, you know, I think as far as, where does it go? Where's it going? So our not the shill, but I think it's useful in this case because it's my hypothesis. So, like, what I see with the pandora's obviously done really well. I mean, I don't know what the market cap is today, but, like, it came from nowhere and went to a huge market cap really fast.
00:07:55.194 - 00:08:33.584, Speaker B: So this isn't necessarily 100% true, but they were also first. So you have to kind of keep that in mind. Like, they're the first people ever do what they did, I think. Especially when you start mixing together, like, NFTs that are more like PFP focused or something like this, if you can lean into both metas at once and make something that's a good meme coin and also a good PFP, and they sort of play together like, that's going to be a big winner. So, like, ours is called king shit. And it's just like, I was picturing, like, what's going to be funny to see at the top of deck screener trending. And so, like, that's where the ticker comes from.
00:08:33.584 - 00:09:36.914, Speaker B: And then the actual PFP are these ridiculous ducks that just look like, you know, they have an attitude problem, basically. You know, it's like, that's kind of like the, and they all have crowns or some kind of hat or something, so they're all kings, you know, like, so it's just kind of like this is the, this is our sort of take on it. And I think that I always described it, like, okay, with meme coins, you have this intersection of people who, like, some of these people are defi people, some of these people are NFT people, but you don't necessarily get all of both crowds now as gains go up, you know, giant green candles attract everybody. So most people are. Yeah, most people are not fading at this point, I think. But, like, from just an interest level, I think you can actually reach a wider audience with these because you can get the people who just care about the NFT part and they can trade it that way. They can, like, have Twitter spaces and talk about, you know, geek out on all the traits and all this kind of stuff, and then you have people who literally don't care about that and they just trade the coin and look at charts.
00:09:36.914 - 00:10:31.770, Speaker B: So, like, I think you just have this potential to reach a wider group. I think where people are going to kind of, like, I don't know, like a lot of stuff's going to work. I mean, it's a bull market, so, you know, it's not like, I don't know, I've gone through a few bear markets and bull markets now. So in a bull market, a lot of stuff that shouldn't work just does, you know, so I'm not going to say, like, it's not going to. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I don't know, as far as predicting things go, that's a good way to get in trouble. But my kind of hypothesis around it is, like, if you could design something that functions well, sort of in both arenas, then you end up with something that could really catch fire, you know, because you have people who want to hold it for different reasons and that, you know, creates supplies, shock and whatever, because people don't want to sell the rare ones and so on and so forth.
00:10:31.770 - 00:10:37.730, Speaker B: So, um, I don't know, there's a lot. There's a lot to that I'd love.
00:10:37.762 - 00:11:39.034, Speaker A: To see, um, see, you know, like how some, some defi products where they get, like, traction and they start to build a community, then they may launch, like, the one off the top of my head, I'm thinking, like, GMX, so that I love Blueberry club. I'd love to kind of see a trend where a Defi product that gets relative product market fit, and I use that like lightly because I think people, we're still find our feet with regards to that. But if their actual token was launched as a 404, I think that could have some interest in dynamics. And I understand that particularly if there was any, if they wanted to do like Rev share or anything like that, the contract might start getting a little bit funky. But I think that could be a really cool dynamic if instead of just launching a bear ERC 20, even if it was just like a governance token, I think a 404 could be a really unique way to kind of just get that extra bit of juice out of the community and that aspect of the build.
00:11:39.694 - 00:12:31.062, Speaker B: I was talking to a DeFi protocol, like year and a half ago, I think, and they were working on something where they were gonna basically take their, like your liquidity position. When you add whatever the new v, whatever LP is they were working on, you get an NFT back. And I was like, how funny would it be if actually that was like part of like an art collection or something? Because now you get people who are like, well, if I burn this LP, I lose this nft that I really like. And it's like, I. Is that super meaningful? Like, I don't know. But at the same time, anything you can do to sort of like, create these weird pressures is like fun to experiment with. For me in crypto because it's just like, yeah, you're gonna get somebody who's got a whale position and he doesn't ever want to take it out because he's gonna burn some super rare piece by some artist that he likes or something.
00:12:31.062 - 00:12:34.470, Speaker B: You know, it's just goofy. But why not? It's crypto.
00:12:34.622 - 00:13:24.160, Speaker A: Well, they like, if you open a uni v three position, you get like a terrible, like, representation of what your position looks like in NFT format. But like, it's really interesting, you say, about the pressures, because when I was first purchasing Pandora and like a lot of 404s came onto the market like a couple of days thereafter, it was just like, there was this weird kind of round number theory, like playing into my head. Every single time I was like wanting to sell, I wanted to buy. Maybe I was like, at 0.95 and I was like, well, I'll just pay the extra and round it up and get the NFT. Even if I was never going to look at the NFT or I might want to take half off, but that's going to leave me as like a non round number and then I'm going to lose. It was really strange, like that internal dynamic.
00:13:24.160 - 00:13:35.484, Speaker A: And I was speaking to a few other people and they're like, yeah, well, you can't not have a whole round number of it because you like. But there's no, like additional, you know, it was really, really weird dynamic that never experienced before.
00:13:36.044 - 00:14:04.204, Speaker B: Mm hmm. Yeah, I think so. My, my perception on Pandora is like, because it's, I don't know, the focus I don't feel like is as much on the NFT. Like, in terms of, like, what the NFT is. What happened with what we were doing is it's, it's a PFP project. So people kind of minted it from that perspective. And then they're trading it on a Dex and it's like they're getting, it's like, holy crap, this is easy.
00:14:04.204 - 00:14:54.124, Speaker B: This is the bet. And then Trader Joe, actually, to their credit, which is super cool, is like, for 404s, if you mint an NFT on their decks, like, it'll pop down now and show you which nfts you minted and linked back to their marketplace. So it creates this really fun kind of trading experience that most of the NFT people that were using this for the first time this way were like, holy crap, this is interesting. And what we're hearing is, I don't know. I mean, it's not like it's statistically significant data or anything, but I've heard from probably like ten people now who are like, man, once you do this, and these are like NFT maxis who like, they love the NFT market and stuff. They're going like, now nfts that aren't like this one guy said, it's like a computer without, like a laptop without the screen or something, which is a weird metaphor. I kind of like maybe it's like radio to tv or something.
00:14:54.124 - 00:14:58.304, Speaker B: Like there's something really noticeably different about trading like this.
00:14:59.604 - 00:15:43.046, Speaker A: Because it was interesting, isn't it? Because we've had, like, we had the, obviously the NFT boom and then you started to see the infrastructure get built out around it and then stuff like Sudoswap and NFT perp and, I don't know, Blair, with Blair lend and there was obviously an appetite to get those more financialized derivatives or products on top of it. Do you think we start to build out? Is it really, really too early to ask? Or do you think we start building out the infrastructure for the marketplaces or the products built off the back of it? The financialization aspect of it.
00:15:43.230 - 00:16:35.526, Speaker B: Pandora is building out their own marketplace for 404s, which is supposed to drop in the next day or two, I think, on eth, I would assume. And I think like we're working on some stuff on our side. I know Trader Joe's working on some stuff. I do think there will be some like sort of like trading tools built out. The interesting thing with it is since it's like functions as ERC 20 in a lot of ways, it can just slip into all the defi infrastructure that exists. So that's going to be interesting to see, like, you know, because it, in coming back to what you were saying, I mean, these things could launch a Defi product, could launch their token as a 404 and then just, it's like any other token. It just has this extra thing attached to it, you know, so you can kind of go both ways.
00:16:35.526 - 00:16:43.954, Speaker B: Like, I'm in the NFT world. So we took it from like, let's make a PFP with this extra stuff going in this direction, but you go the other direction too, you know?
00:16:45.414 - 00:17:06.914, Speaker A: Yeah. And how is like kind of avalanche community and users responded to what you've been building with kingship because obviously that's been like the Noah Trader Joe launched something similar. But like, this feels like the first one that's really kind of took, took hold and kind of captured a lot of my share over there.
00:17:08.534 - 00:17:47.194, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I think what was funny is like, you had mixed, mixed reviews, I would say, from the NFT crowd because there's, how can I put this? I don't want to like, piss people off too much. So. Okay, this goes back to a separate question. So one of the things I think is interesting and even like, the head of nfts for avalanche actually, let me answer the first thing. So we were the number one NFT on avalanche for like the last several days. Like, we do more volume than everybody else and almost everybody else.
00:17:47.194 - 00:18:12.802, Speaker B: There's one collection that we're sort of tied with which I'm a big fan of what they're doing. So I don't want to insult that at all. But, like, you know, a lot of the trading that's happened on avalanche for nfts for the last months has been incentivized very heavily by the Avalanche Foundation. I don't know where the rewards or whatever come from, but it's like there's, you know, millions of dollars allocated towards incentivizing NFT trading on hyperspace, for example.
00:18:12.858 - 00:18:13.494, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:14.044 - 00:18:51.838, Speaker B: So that's fine. I think it's cool. Like I'm happy to see them doing that. But we, all of those projects have been, you know, falling during the meme coin season because the attention just might, you can't fight the attention in a bull market. Like, it's just when there's a wave, if you're trying to scream at people that come pay attention to your thing, you're just gonna lose because everybody is going this way. So we've benefited from the fact that, like, we fit into that narrative and then whenever things switch back the other way, we're also going to fit into that narrative. So I really like, at least that's my thinking.
00:18:51.838 - 00:19:44.554, Speaker B: So I really like that. The thing that I think we did get some backlash on is there's a lot of people who really, really, really like the, like, ERC 721 model, and those people tend to be founders. Like, I had some people who, like, were prepping to launch who were like, a little bit frustrated by this. And it's because it's kind of like, in my way of thinking about it, like, meme coin launches are not like NFT launches. Like, if you get in early on a meme coin launch, you might get in for like, you know, when the market cap is $50,000 or something and then it goes to 100 million or something and you just made it, you know, like, that totally happens. Um, if you have to start off with giving out a million dollars or half a million dollars to an NFT project and then hope that the floor goes up from there.
00:19:44.714 - 00:19:45.454, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:45.874 - 00:20:01.894, Speaker B: And, like, what are you really paying the team for in most? I'm not saying no teams are good, but, like, most of the time it's, they're going to run a discord, you know, or whatever. The thing is, like, I just don't model.
00:20:01.974 - 00:20:05.086, Speaker A: Not every team's like lucanettes and put you back with no.
00:20:05.230 - 00:21:08.458, Speaker B: Now, I'm not saying people won't pay for a good project, because they will, obviously. But I just feel like there's so many people out there because, like, I say this as I'm friends with all these artists from the last couple years and I know there's people, because I'm working with some of these people to do this is like they're ready to drop sick collections and like, make no money and just keep back a small allocation and, like, launch it like a meme coin, you know? And I think this, this model will beat the other models because it's a lower barrier to entry at the beginning. You have a lot more potential for upside. There's a chart attached to it, you know, like just automatically, I don't know, I could talk on and on and on about it, but I think, like, fundraising, I mean, the idea of raising half a million dollars without giving anybody equity or any real promise of any kind of future return, like, this is not a thing that should exist long term. Probably like, you could never go to like a VC and raise a, you know, small, you know, seed round and offer them nothing. We're not going to give you anything. It's just going to be fun.
00:21:08.458 - 00:21:10.466, Speaker B: We're going to have good vibes, you.
00:21:10.490 - 00:21:12.614, Speaker A: Know, like be a hot pitch.
00:21:13.754 - 00:21:21.054, Speaker B: Yeah. So anyway, I have some opinions about that, you might say, but it's. I think that this is very disruptive.
00:21:21.704 - 00:21:47.604, Speaker A: 100%. It feels like it's, it's. The incentives are aligned for founders and whoever wants to get involved in much better way, like launching with a 404 as opposed to like standardized, how an NFT mint would go. It feels like a lot more. Yes. As I say, like, yeah, you're not. I suppose with an NFT it's.
00:21:47.604 - 00:22:16.160, Speaker A: It would be more like an option. Like you're gonna just give someone money. That money could just be completely written off or it could go to freaking 100 airbags or something. Airbags or whatever the fuck. Whereas with this, as you say, you've got the potential if you want to scale out. I know you might want to take some off the table at specific markups or whatever the hell you want to do, but it just feels like the incentives are a little bit more lined both sides of the fence. Yeah, sure.
00:22:16.160 - 00:22:33.432, Speaker A: Is this, in your opinion, is there still like some shortcomings with the quote unquote standard of 404s? Like a lot of kind of pushback on gas inefficiencies and, like, you'll know a lot more about it than me because I'm not exactly technical.
00:22:33.488 - 00:23:18.654, Speaker B: So, yeah, I would say there's definitely some, some drawbacks. I mean, we had to do some pretty deep dives with some other devs to get something that functions where you can basically have. So with Pandora, the ids are always going up all the time. So, like, what is it? There's only ever 10,000 in existence, but like, the number can go up and infinitely essentially with, like. So for a PFP collection, it doesn't make sense. You have to, like, if there's 10,000 items, you're only going to have 10,000 ids. So, like, if somebody burns one, it's got to go back into some kind of pool and then pull that back out later if somebody mints a new one, et cetera, et cetera, which causes all sorts of freaking weird problems.
00:23:18.654 - 00:23:36.672, Speaker B: So, you know, that. That took quite a bit to sort that out. And I think we're on avalanche. So I'm less worried about gas prices than I would be if I was on eth. But it's not, it's not. Not a worry if that makes sense. It's just not as critic, like, critical immediately.
00:23:36.672 - 00:24:11.322, Speaker B: It's like, down the line, it may be an issue. So, um, I have some, you know, people working with me to try to, like, gas, optimize it and stuff like that. But I think at the end of the day, like, we're definitely going to see some experimentation around. This thing I liked about it is sort of like a. It's a double edged sword because I think everybody who started in 2017 got burned by all these hacks, and then it kind of became like, oh, don't step outside of the boundaries because then people get hurt. That's true. It's a fact.
00:24:11.322 - 00:24:48.604, Speaker B: Like, you have to be very careful, I think, at the same time, like, we do, I did, like, the sort of experimental nature of this. Like, let's just fucking do it, you know, and, like, make it. Make it happen and. And, um, I don't know. There's always a pendulum with that kind of stuff. There's definitely some drawbacks, and I think that it will get better. I think that what it does, though, is just, it illustrated that there's really, really a market fit with this where, like, you have something people just enjoy trading more than a normal Nft, you know, like, fundamentally, I think it's just better.
00:24:48.604 - 00:24:58.346, Speaker B: So, yeah, we're going to have to, like, figure out how to, like, tighten all the things up over time, but I think it's worthwhile, if that makes sense.
00:24:58.520 - 00:25:26.500, Speaker A: 100% is, um, how far on the. Kind of. With the collection, how far, like. Or how far did you go with the differentiation? So, like, rarities, traits? Did you. Did you really lean into it? Is there, like, a subset, like, super rare? Because there must be some weird games that people play, like, with, like, lp and arbitrage on. On the actual marketplace itself. Like, if those rarities are really nailed down.
00:25:26.500 - 00:25:29.788, Speaker A: Have you seen anything interesting that 100%.
00:25:29.876 - 00:25:53.416, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a real, like, PFP collection. Like, it's full on. Like, there's one of ones and legendaries and rare and, like, all these. I mean, it's the whole deal. So what. What people have figured out is, like, there's you know, you can actually go check the null address. I think it's on Trader Joe, like on their marketplace for NFTs.
00:25:53.416 - 00:26:17.124, Speaker B: And you can see like, the order in which things are going to get minted. So, like, people play the game of like, they try to sell a little bit and burn an NFT and then like, wait, and then like, snipe, a rare one that somebody puts in, it's 100%. Like people are going to bought it. And that gets interesting because then that creates volume and all sorts of things. So, yeah, people are playing that game 100%.
00:26:18.274 - 00:26:31.810, Speaker A: Yeah. So what, what do you want to, what do you want to do next with it? You want to just kind of put it out there, see what, how people pick it up and run with it? Is there any kind of, know what kind of roadmaps can get you killed in this space, but just want to know where your heads are with, like, next steps.
00:26:32.002 - 00:27:00.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I think as far as, like, I have, there's two answers to this, really. So with King shit, it's like me and the artists are good friends and like, we're going to nft NYC together. And like, we, we realized toward the, in the beginning it was just like, hey, I want to do this thing. I'm curious about this technology. Let's see if we can put something together. And in like a few weeks we just put this together. And then toward the end, he and I were looking at the brand materials he was creating and it's like, holy crap.
00:27:00.454 - 00:28:04.060, Speaker B: Like, this is actually really high quality. Like, we have really funny memes, we have really good brand icons. Like, all this stuff is cool. So we're kind of exploring different ways we could build out some funny stuff with it. Like, one of the things this is, I don't know if it's alpha because it's just us exploring it, but, like, one of the things we were looking at is like, can we start like a whiskey brand with a giant duck on the front, you know, or something hilarious, you know, it's like we're really kind of investigating, like, because I've run other businesses outside of web3, you know, so. And have friends who've, you know, got distribution all around America in grocery stores and stuff like this. So, like, we're kind of leaning into our network and our interests and, like, how can we do something cool here that's a longer term play and that hopefully extends past even like, a bull market, right? Like, if you just have a cool brand IP and you can do something fun and that creates, like, longevity for the project in my way of looking at it, which is something we didn't necessarily start with in our heads, but it's just like, this is really fun.
00:28:04.060 - 00:28:40.784, Speaker B: This is really cool. We like what we've done here, so let's just see where we can take it. On the other side of it, like, I'm building out some, like, tools for trading and stuff like that for 404s. Excuse me. So I really want to help people who are artists who want to kind of lean into it and launch something so we can get more into that later or I can, you know, I'll share more information on my Twitter and stuff, but, you know, not talking about it too much yet, but some kind of, like, launchpad trading platform is something in the works.
00:28:41.204 - 00:29:03.454, Speaker A: All right. Sick. Is there anything, like, I don't know, you might see this, but, like, behind the scenes, is there anyone else who's building in the NFT space that you've chatted about around, like, 404? Is that, like, what's the kind of general consensus for people who've, like, already built in this space? Is everyone's interest really peaks? Like, is there any kind of, you know, general consensus behind the scenes?
00:29:04.874 - 00:29:34.242, Speaker B: You know, I think the only. So there's pandora, obviously, outside of them. And to be honest, I don't keep up with everything going on east super closely. So there may be people building things that I'm not aware of there. On avalanche, I know, like Trader Joe is, has built some stuff and is working on some stuff. They were working on some things for meme coins specifically. And I think they're, this is from afar.
00:29:34.242 - 00:30:01.986, Speaker B: Like, I don't know what their plans are exactly. I think they're trying to find a way to hook in, like, some 404 launchpad kind of stuff to it. If I'm guessing, not sure. Certainly. They've done some really cool things that are small, like little quality of life things on the UX side, which are really, really cool in general. I've been really, I was yelling at people for, like, weeks, like, even before we launched this. I was like, this is the next big thing.
00:30:01.986 - 00:30:41.980, Speaker B: You need to, like, like, some other marketing places and stuff. You need to take this seriously. And, and honestly, I think people are kind of fading it still, which is funny, I think as of the last week, like, it was really funny because, you know, we have a chart and so when you have your chart is up, everybody's happy and when it's down, everybody's like, oh, we told you it was gonna die. You know, so, like, we went from, we launched for like 0.1 Avax, which would have been like $4 or something at the time. So we went from that to like eight, $800 in a day, and then it fell back down to like 100 and 5200 bucks and just stayed there. And it was like, see, this is why 404 is like, it's not going to work.
00:30:41.980 - 00:31:08.604, Speaker B: Now we're sitting, we went to like eighteen hundred dollars a couple days ago and it's sitting in like 1400 right now or something in that ballpark. So now everybody's paying attention. But they weren't two weeks ago. So I don't know what all the other people is going on in their heads, but I think if this continues to grow, I just expect there to be like more and more and more people coming in, you know, and trying to build things, which is cool.
00:31:09.144 - 00:31:47.154, Speaker A: I think there's always a, that initial kind of explosion onto the scene and then people regroup and what's the best way to actually kind of take a fold. And it feels like we've had the, like, what's the word? We've had the kind of down period after the first initial kind of explosion and then stuff starts to, like, slowly hockey stick up. And I think we're just probably entering that phase now where people have had a little bit of time to digest. Anyone who came in for a grift is gone. And now, like, people who, like, really see the kind of the benefits and the vision of it. I think those people start coming to the fore now or I'd like to think about.
00:31:48.994 - 00:32:09.546, Speaker B: It'll go in waves, I think. I mean, I don't think meme coins are done with whatever they're going to do yet. I mean, avalanche is literally starting meme coin rush this week. I mean, it's like a whole. That's a whole thing that's gone live. Yeah. Like, and who knows, dude? Like, we have, we have.
00:32:09.546 - 00:32:12.374, Speaker B: Ohm. Forks are back. So, yeah.
00:32:13.084 - 00:32:15.224, Speaker A: Uh, mistake this morning.
00:32:15.644 - 00:32:29.716, Speaker B: Yeah, I was, if you're not familiar, just know that I got up this morning and did two prayers on my two wallets that, you know, to make sure that I'm receiving the faith. It's just. We're back. We're back.
00:32:29.740 - 00:32:30.824, Speaker A: We're definitely back.
00:32:31.364 - 00:32:53.922, Speaker B: Uh, so, yeah, I. So I don't know how long that's gonna play out. I would expect that to take some months. And I think this is interesting because, like, it can do well in this cycle, but I don't think it'll be the main focus. This is me just predicting things like I said I shouldn't do. I don't know. I don't think it'll like steal the limelight yet.
00:32:53.922 - 00:33:41.624, Speaker B: I think once meme coins sort of like have their moment, maybe their moment is the whole bull market. Like, I don't know. I haven't figured this out yet because this feels a little different to me than previous cycles as far as like the attention there goes. But this will at some point probably in the next several months like really pop up and like capture the limelight. I think that's just the gut feeling and we're just gonna kind of build cool stuff and see what happens. You know, it, it's, it's hilarious cuz like, you know, I didn't, I didn't expect it to get the, as big as it did as quick as it did for us, which, it's not huge. I mean, it's only a few million dollar market cap, but on avalanche, like, especially coming from a bear market like some months ago, like, that's crazy, you know, so we could get a lot bigger.
00:33:41.624 - 00:33:43.364, Speaker B: So we'll see.
00:33:44.264 - 00:34:35.198, Speaker A: Yeah. And what, so you've kind of touched upon some of your more artist focused pieces who are just building and just for the love of sick, for the love of it and just like pushing stuff out. What's, what's kind of happening in that area of the market because I tend to see certain stuff and then like some stuff just falls off. And I think it's really, really difficult for like an individual to capture market share and attention. Like, it's really, really difficult. Like, obviously to the extreme people did it. But like what's happening in that aspect industry because I still have like such strong opinions over, like if you are creating anything like in that aspect of the industry, you should be publishing it as nfts and stuff.
00:34:35.198 - 00:34:39.394, Speaker A: But I love to kind of get a bit of an insight into what's going on over there.
00:34:41.294 - 00:35:38.164, Speaker B: From what I can tell. It's just really kind of tough. I think some people are, I've seen some artists actually that I'm friends with like kind of jump into meme coins, funny enough, just because like they realize like this is where all the attention is. I think there's a, I try to say this without putting too much like opinion into it, but I think, like, I've observed a lot of artists who come in from like the art world thinking like this is the new place where they're going to sell art. They think of it rightly so as like, this is their work and they should get paid for their work and whatever. And I think that crypto just goes through these, like, cycles so aggressively where, like, all the attention is on this thing that, like, it's a very hard gig. And so, like, I kind of feel for a lot of people who are sitting by right now going like, man, why is.
00:35:38.164 - 00:36:22.664, Speaker B: And, like, I see this on my timeline sometimes. Like, some artists, like, really trying to garner attention and just, there's nobody there for it almost, because most people in the space, if they're gonna throw a $1,000 or something right now, if you think you could throw a something that's gonna 100 x and you can cash out in four days, you're gonna do that every time. And. And I think that becomes very hard to, like, you know, grab people's attention. My best guess is, like, later on in the cycle when everybody's made it, then they're gonna want to collect things and all this kind of stuff. And this is what I told my friend Scribble Warlock, his artist name on Twitter. He's the one who did the ducks, and he's a phenomenal artist.
00:36:22.664 - 00:37:06.270, Speaker B: He's done a lot of one on ones and all this kind of stuff, and he just kind of, like, took that hat off and put on the dj and hat and went full crazy with this. And it's amazing to watch, but I kind of think artists that kind of lean into that might do better in the short term. And it's hard to, it's hard to sell to people because, like, there is a mindset, which I think is not wrong, which is like, if I'm putting work out there, I should get paid for it. Fair enough. But there's also this aspect of web3 that's sort of like startup II, right? And like entrepreneur, whatever. And if this is what I was going, this goes back to the whole funding thing. Like, it actually aligns everybody's incentives really well.
00:37:06.270 - 00:37:54.590, Speaker B: If you're an artist and you say, I'm gonna create a collection and I'm gonna keep back a couple percentage of the thing, and we're gonna put it all on LP, and then, like, people can now, like, I'm invested in it like you are. I want this to go well, you know? And I think it's not how people normally sell art, and I understand that, and most people aren't going to do that, but it's an interesting opportunity for the few people who do dive into it in the short term. But, yeah, I would. I don't know. I think it's just kind of tough right now in the art space, I expect NFt NYC this year and NFT NYC next year to be very different experiences, you know, because, like, later cycle stuff, people made a ton of money, so on and so forth.
00:37:54.782 - 00:38:29.308, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it definitely is like a later cycle thing for that particular type of asset. Everyone's at a wealth effect. Everyone's wanting to put it into, like, anything they can get their hands on. Really. Like, it's. The cash is just burn the hole in people's pockets. And I think it must be really, really tough because it's difficult for projects that are building in this space with full marketing teams and building their own community around them to kind of even just keep being flavor of the week, because it's one thing, then it's the next.
00:38:29.308 - 00:38:34.424, Speaker A: For individual kind of content creator or artists, I can imagine it's super, super difficult.
00:38:35.884 - 00:39:26.666, Speaker B: I think it's got to be pretty disorienting because I think a lot of people kind of came in, I don't know, like every, there's people who came in at all different points, but I know for sure a lot of artists came in, like, middle end of last cycle because they saw some of their artists friends who were, like, on clubhouse or whatever. Like, there was this weird cohort of people who were, like, all on clubhouse in like, 2020. And for some reason, a lot of these artists just did amazing going into 2021, and then a bunch of their friends kind of came in after them and did okay. And now a lot of those people that I talked to are kind of like, what's going on? Like, why is nobody buying anything? Like, the market is dead, but everybody's making money. And it's like, yeah, it's hard to explain. It's just, it's just this. The attention cycles and crypto are nuts.
00:39:26.666 - 00:39:30.454, Speaker B: You know, it's not a, it's not a normal kind of business environment.
00:39:31.354 - 00:40:13.304, Speaker A: The one of the, one of the only people I've seen really stand out currently is that bold Leonidas. I think that's how you say his name. He's like the cartoonist, but he's very much, very reactive to whatever's going on in the space, and he can be really responsive to what's going on in the industry. And obviously, from the way that he's drawing and he's cartoon and his sketches, he obviously has a really good handle of how the space is operating. So. And it's obviously great for virality because if someone else is talking about, well, that could. That guy the other day was in the bitcoin masterclass, and then he can go and spin something up.
00:40:13.304 - 00:40:26.284, Speaker A: The algorithm is just washing that around. It's putting it in front of people. People are like, it's relevant. They've just seen it. It gets more engagement, and then obviously, the momentum just continues from there. But that's a total different game to what.
00:40:26.914 - 00:40:46.898, Speaker B: It's same thing with, like, this. What happened with scribble. I mean, he got, like, it's funny because avalanche, during the bear market, felt like a small town. Like, you knew everybody, and now there's, like, tons of new people in crypto, Twitter for avalanche, whatever you want to say, and. And you just don't know. There's a lot of new people. I don't know.
00:40:46.898 - 00:41:19.298, Speaker B: And I assume everybody knows me or scribble or whoever because, like, you know, small town kind of deal, right. What's funny is now that he's kind of leaned in on this side, it's the same sort of thing where he's commenting on all the meme coin stuff that's going on, and he's just making hilarious memes all the time. And it's like, now everybody wants his one of one art, which is funny. So it's. It's a limited opportunity, I would say, because not everybody's gonna be successful at that. You know? And it's. I don't know.
00:41:19.298 - 00:41:35.094, Speaker B: It's. It's kind of hard because, like, I love trying to help people navigate this stuff, but not everybody is going to be able to do it successfully. And it requires a certain personality type, I think, to jump in and just navigate all the degeneracy, frankly. You know?
00:41:35.174 - 00:41:57.674, Speaker A: Yeah, you've got to be terminally online, I think, just to be able to pick up, like, someone popped into our telegram earlier, and they were just like, right. I was. I was away from the desk yesterday. What have I missed? And I was just like, so much has happened. Good luck. But it really, really is. You take a day off, and you're just like, I feel like I'm the new kid at school again.
00:41:57.674 - 00:42:00.402, Speaker A: I have no idea what's going on. Mm hmm.
00:42:00.538 - 00:42:20.466, Speaker B: Now, you. You. Honestly, it's kind of. It is a meme or whatever, but, like, bull markets are not for sleeping or whatever. The thing is, you know, it's just like. No. Like, I spend, to the annoyance of my wife, most of my waking moments looking at Twitter.
00:42:20.466 - 00:42:30.738, Speaker B: You know, at least I'll be doing other things. And then, like, you gotta keep. You gotta keep in, like, I wouldn't have joined this cult if I was not, you know, what I mean, like, we're. Yeah, he knows what I mean.
00:42:30.906 - 00:43:18.746, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I'm not. What do you, what do you think, what do you think we're heading with, with meme coins? Like, I, I made a point at like late last year when I seen stuff happening on Solana and I was just like, look, every ecosystem should at least try to kind of cultivate something because I think similar to what we were saying with nfts. Nfts on boarded so many people last cycle because it was just like, ought to pitch in at my cup and value. Like a lot of kind of normie people who were kind of tourists that came in because with the promise of gold. I think it's a similar onboarding experience to what's happening now. And ecosystem should be cultivating that.
00:43:18.746 - 00:43:42.274, Speaker A: If that's a customer acquisition or customer acquisition channel, you might get 1020, 30% of those people sticking around and then adding true value to the ecosystem and investing in some of the projects that might be, quote unquote, building more of a legitimate space. I don't know what you kind of think about that maybe through the avalanche lens or just as an ecosystem as a whole.
00:43:44.694 - 00:44:08.814, Speaker B: I think the way you put it is really good. I think that's how I would look at it if I was. Avalanche is like, this is a really good onboarding tool. Some percentage of these people will become community members who stay. I mean, that's who was there during the bear market. So you're always trying to build that base of people who were here during the bull and they stick around and then they bring on their friends and whatever. So I think that's right.
00:44:08.814 - 00:45:19.398, Speaker B: I'm really, like, I'm really on a very much more macro scale curious about, like, if the younger generation just has very different ideas about younger generations, I should say, have very different ideas about investing. Like, if you look at, like, GameStop and AMC and all this kind of stuff, like, there's something about just rallying around something ridiculous and, like, having fun and like, like, because, I mean, yeah, there was the initial hypothesis around why that was gonna work or whatever, but most people weren't necessarily plugged into that. It was just like, this is stupid, let's just do it, you know, middle finger to the men and all this kind of thing or whatever. And I think there's something about, like, I'm not an advocate at all of, like, all these racist coins that have been popping off, but I think that some of that stems less from, like, actual racism and more from, like, just this kind of like, like, rebellious. Like, we're just gonna do the craziest thing possible. Attitude and like, just, just piss people off because we can. And so the, hopefully that one doesn't stick around.
00:45:19.398 - 00:45:35.304, Speaker B: But at the same time, like, I think think meme coins and, like, I don't know, like, like they may have more legs than people realize. Like, realistically, just because people like to rally behind stuff and feel like they're a part of something, you know? Like, I don't know.
00:45:36.084 - 00:46:21.744, Speaker A: And I think there's something to be said about. You made a good point with, like, younger, like, the next flock of kind of younger investors coming in. Like, I'm saying, like, there's some kid on the timeline the other week, he'd been, he was like 14, he'd been rogue, he'd lost all these d gods or some shit. And then I know there's like, this kid on, he was at Toka 2049 last year. He's like twelve year old and he doxed. And, like, he'd been creating these, like, incredible, like, threads on like, new projects and stuff like that. But I do wonder if, like, the TikTok of everything, where everything's instant gratification, lends itself extremely well to boom or bust kind of assets, particularly in the crypto space.
00:46:21.744 - 00:46:24.864, Speaker A: And you're going to get that with me and coins.
00:46:25.804 - 00:47:20.216, Speaker B: I mean, like, it's. I have have a couple of, like, different thoughts on this. I mean, like, the fact that you can actually have twelve year olds who have a bit of money from their parents and then literally within like a few months periods, they're have six figures or whatever, like, and they're. That can scale, you know what I mean? Over like a couple market cycles, you could have like a 17 year old who's like, got millions of dollars and is like, market making some like small cap coins or something. You know what I mean? Like, this is like, okay, so now that person who's 17 is in charge of, like, there's a lot of weird stuff that can happen when you have these kind of situations because it's not like, it's not a mature market with regulations and stuff, you know, it's like, it's crazy. Anyway, no, I. That's a.
00:47:20.216 - 00:47:45.952, Speaker B: That's a really, really difficult question to answer. I have no idea. I suspect, like, the left curve part of me is like, no, these are gonna stick around. Like, I kind of want to find a reason why this is going to pivot back to something more normal. And. And honestly, like, it may just pivot like, we have. We have Ohm forks buying meme coins that are incentivized by blockchain foundations right now.
00:47:45.952 - 00:47:56.644, Speaker B: Like, that's just. That's where we are. So I don't know what this bull market is going to look like because the Ohm forks didn't appear till the end of the last bull market. Yeah.
00:47:57.224 - 00:48:10.368, Speaker A: Yeah, that was fucking. Yeah, when you put it like that. This is. We're already, like, several layers down the onion. And. Yeah, stuff starts, like, ohm folks that we're bonding own folks. And, like, fuck me, it's gonna get.
00:48:10.368 - 00:48:12.244, Speaker A: It's gonna get wild really quickly.
00:48:12.864 - 00:48:28.004, Speaker B: Yeah. So I. I don't know. There's, uh, best bet, like, I can give you some, like, hypotheses, but, like, I. I think we're all on a little bit of a roller coaster, and we're not gonna know until we're. We're further along it. What's going on?
00:48:29.344 - 00:49:13.310, Speaker A: Yeah, what did you, um. So there was quite a lot of pushback after the Eva labs or Avalanche foundation announcement of, like, the culture fund. Like, the meme culture fund, where they're going to be investing. But then, like, what day is it today? We're recording this on the 26 march. And then, like, a couple of days ago, there was, like, an arbitrum proposal for exactly that. So I'm going back and I'm going to get receipts because I know for a fun fact the same people that were throwing shit at the culture fund, I definitely vote in on that proposal to get it passed because there's not a lot of life happening over there at the minute.
00:49:13.502 - 00:49:59.036, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think the Avalanche team people talk a lot of crap, and I see it, and I think they have actually been kind of on the forefront of some of these things right now. I think what. The way you described meme coins earlier is probably a lot how they see it, and it is a fantastic onboarding tool and kind of getting into the front of it and attracting a lot of that attention, you know, assuming that they can, is smart. You know, like, it's going to bring over a lot of users. You're going to see a lot more red triangles and usernames and now praying hands. So, like, it's. It's good for.
00:49:59.036 - 00:50:14.144, Speaker B: It's really good marketing. I mean, just at the base level, it's really, really good marketing. So, you know, I mean, I know Kevin isn't really a fan of meme coins, even, but, like, at the end of the day, it's. Yeah.
00:50:19.484 - 00:50:27.124, Speaker A: Like, if you put something out there that you don't like meme coins? Expect a meme coin to be made about you, like, in the next ten minutes.
00:50:27.744 - 00:50:45.124, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I got one made about me. That was an interesting morning. I didn't, I didn't like, luckily it kind of. After this, maybe it'll come back. I don't know. Not financial advice. I'm not buying it anyway.
00:50:45.904 - 00:50:59.014, Speaker A: Good. All right, so is there anything you want to leave the audience with regards to kingship or anything else? So I'm gonna go buy some now. So I'm gonna front run the episode and launch. I'm gonna go pick some up.
00:51:00.754 - 00:51:26.084, Speaker B: Man. I don't know. I think. I think we're just trying to do some, like, interesting, innovative stuff and have a really good time. I mean, I think that's kind of, like, with all the things going on, I don't think you can take it too seriously, if that makes sense. But we just gonna try to do some cool stuff. So if you want to hang out and enjoy the ride, that's pretty much, you know, what we're doing.
00:51:26.084 - 00:51:28.484, Speaker B: It ain't too complicated, you know.
00:51:28.824 - 00:51:41.644, Speaker A: There we go. I really like the more humble approach as opposed to everyone saying they're going to create a infinite metaverse and they're going to have, like, plushies in Walmart bar next week.
00:51:42.544 - 00:52:01.094, Speaker B: Man, if we actually managed to start, like, a whiskey company or something, it'd be the sickest thing ever, you know? Cuz, like, I just fundamentally, that's not a web3 business. Like, everybody wants to make it one, but it's like, people been drinking since, like forever, you know, like, it's hard to find an older business.
00:52:01.594 - 00:52:08.414, Speaker A: So investment from whiskeys as well. Some of the old stuff. Jesus Christ.
00:52:10.074 - 00:52:39.614, Speaker B: So anyway, I don't know, like, that's just kind of our mindset is like, what can we do that would be cool and not necessarily, like, I'm not gonna try to prop up the price, you know, of the token. Like, people are gonna trade it, whatever it trades at, and. And, like, hopefully goes up because I have some. But, like, we're just gonna do the coolest stuff possible and, like, we're gonna go to New York and hang out with a bunch of cool people and tell them about it. And so, you know, it just is what it is.
00:52:39.954 - 00:52:43.622, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks very much for your time, man. I really appreciate it.
