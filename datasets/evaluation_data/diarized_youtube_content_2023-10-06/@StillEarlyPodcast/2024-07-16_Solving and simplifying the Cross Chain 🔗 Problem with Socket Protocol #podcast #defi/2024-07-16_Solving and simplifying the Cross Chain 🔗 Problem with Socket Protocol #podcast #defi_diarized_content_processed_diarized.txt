00:00:00.200 - 00:00:43.472, Speaker A: And the thing that we kind of came to was there are so many chains right now that even if you solve the cross chain problem, which is like, you build the fastest bridge, you build the cheapest bridge, you are on every network that's out there, your users will still be in a very bad position because now you have like 20 chains, 20 gas tokens, 20 rpcs that may fail or may not fail, and you have assets all over the place. So often, even I was in this problem where I had $1,000, right? And I want to buy this NFT that's worth $1,000. But my $1,000 are split across chain such that I can't do it without clicking n number of times. Probably 30, 40 times. I feel so poor, man. I just want to buy this nft. I really like it, and I have the money, but it's everywhere.
00:00:43.472 - 00:00:59.540, Speaker A: And to get it over here, it's too much work. It's not worth it. That's how we basically came to this realization that we need something much more high level, something that elevates the users and developers to this chain abstracted world so that you don't have to interact with chains anymore.
