00:00:00.320 - 00:00:24.965, Speaker A: It's all coming down to what is the point of life, I think, for a lot of people, like, when do we bring life into this world? Why do we bring life into this world? Like now, I think in Korea, they're giving people 36k bonus as soon as they get married. They're giving them also baby bonuses. The amounts are getting bigger and bigger. So, you know, you're not far from a society where people may start to get paid just to reproduce. So I think all these trends are kind of going to come together that way.
00:00:30.875 - 00:00:47.315, Speaker B: Yeah, I've. I messaged, messaged sue the other day. I didn't know how serious he was about this whole Sperm five thing. And then I actually got thinking about it and I was like, might be. There might actually be something here. And then like, the old me was calling me and being like, go, go and have a look. Go and have a look.
00:00:47.315 - 00:01:00.345, Speaker B: Because that was like my background. Well, not particularly kind of fertility, but cancer research, immunology, stem cells and all that kind of. So there's still, still something there, you know? But yeah, I just want to kind of pick your brains on what your heads are.
00:01:01.245 - 00:01:29.463, Speaker C: That was exactly what happened to me too, is I heard about it and at first I was like, this is just goofy, man. This is like absurdly goofy. And then you start thinking about it more and you're like, hold up, wait, no, this, like, there might actually be like a viable market for this, but, like, more so it's like, even if there is no market, this is. This is itself like the most insane, like, viral marketing framework that exists for anything in the universe.
00:01:29.519 - 00:01:29.807, Speaker D: Right?
00:01:29.871 - 00:01:44.935, Speaker C: Like, it can just be advertised infinitely for free by angry people on TikTok, Twitter. Like, it would be able to just be the dating discourse driver forever.
00:01:47.555 - 00:01:49.347, Speaker B: Yeah, sue, where's the initial idea came.
00:01:49.371 - 00:02:43.045, Speaker A: From one of my friends, she is pretty early in crypto and has actually been theorizing about spur markets for many years. I think she first mentioned to me maybe two, three years ago, and I actually didn't understand how much of a buyer's demand there really is out there. But I think recently I've just thought, you know, as you get older, a lot of your friends start freezing eggs and they start, you know, coming into that part of the market. And one thing I realized is that, you know, when. When you think about fertility tech right now, a lot of it is focused on helping women freeze eggs, right? So there's a lot of apps on monitoring, monitoring cycles as well as freezing eggs. But, you know, eggs actually just don't survive that. Well, in general, a lot of times there's going to be need to, you know, doctors will push you to try to freeze an embryo as well, to freeze embryos.
00:02:43.045 - 00:03:33.955, Speaker A: And so, you know, the sperm market right now in the US is already multibillion dollar market. And you know, there's several top sperm banks that have been operating, you know, it's kind of legacy models for decades now. And you know, the market's really heating up. A lot of the demand actually comes from Asia to sort of buy sperm. So, you know, it kind of got us thinking about, you know, what would like a next gen sperm bank look like and also kind of what are the sort of both crypto adjacent and non adjacent kind of things that will likely happen. And we've been theorizing about natalism as well, you know, and I think natalism right now, at least the way it's been described, a lot of it has been very male centric. It's not really usually women who post about how, oh, you know, the birth rate's going down, we need to have more kids.
00:03:33.955 - 00:04:26.669, Speaker A: It's usually like some dude who's really like a bit red pilled who's talking about how, you know, like women should start getting married at 21 again and have six kids. It's obviously like a very revanchist kind of like a nostalgic thing. I mean, my view is that, you know, if you have female empowerment, you're going to have that less pressure on marriage to get married on women because they can support themselves. And so you're going to have different models for family formation in the future. And so I think that to the extent that natalism and how people will have children in the future, I think that structure will also change. I think it'll be ultimately driven by female choice because for all the larping that men do about natalism, women raise the children. So no child is being raised unless a woman woves it into this world.
00:04:26.669 - 00:05:13.401, Speaker A: So I think, you know, I think you're going to see a lot in general. I think you're going to see destigmatization of this as a market. I think, you know, just this year a lot of journalists starting to write about sperm markets and their experience trying to buy sperm. I think that as you get more and more kind of, you know, into the sort of elder millennial to like Gen z entering their 30s, I think this is going to be huge. I think that, you know, Eileen Gu was a famous sperm baby who, you know, her mother bought sperm Basically when she went to the U.S. and you know that that's something where I think as an aspirational thing, you know, if you're a woman freezing eggs right now, it's going to cost you 10 to 15K. It's actually quite, it's actually quite expensive.
00:05:13.401 - 00:05:48.337, Speaker A: Right. So you know, are you going to also freeze some embryos? You might, you may buy some sperm to freeze embryos. That's why you know, sperm mix. Now you're seeing it very difficult to buy high quality sperm. Especially there's a Guardian article about that part where you know, she said she kept trying to buy a specific one, it wasn't available and then she had a new one also not available and it you know, chronicles her, you know, exasperation at the system and so I think there's a lot of interesting threads to pull on. So. So it's something I've been thinking about especially with the amino chain.
00:05:48.337 - 00:06:04.545, Speaker A: I think they just announced the raise and they're obviously like biobank model infra layer on biobanks sperm and eggs being just one part of that. So I think you know, bio's always been interested mine for a long time too. So I think it's something that, that we've been brainstorming for. Sure.
00:06:05.605 - 00:06:36.891, Speaker B: Where do you think? Obviously there seems to be like a real swing in the demographics of where Beverick seems to be falling off a cliff. And is it like a lot of concentration around Singapore, South Korea, like some kind of more affluent Southeast Asia countries that it just seems to be sub one. What what's going on? Like what, what's, what's the perspectives there? Like why is it seems like China's.
00:06:36.923 - 00:06:38.175, Speaker C: Really going for man.
00:06:39.315 - 00:07:21.633, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think the main reason is that you have, I mean throughout history you've had a lot of strong like upward pressure on women to marry up. In other words they're supposed to marry into a wealthier family or at least the same wealth or the same status. And so that effect is kind of now quite difficult to reconcile with you know, just general female empowerment. Right. Because if you're empowering women, so fun fact but almost all self made female billionaires are from China. It's actually like kind of a, like a true bastion of feminism. Like American women think they're feminists like Chinese women.
00:07:21.633 - 00:07:24.001, Speaker A: China is the true, it's true feminism.
00:07:24.073 - 00:07:33.273, Speaker C: This was a statistic that really like you guys over the last like two weeks just completely convinced me of like yeah, the Chinese women won like everything.
00:07:33.409 - 00:07:42.145, Speaker A: If you think about, if you think about self made crypto women who have made, let's say eight or nine figures. I think they're almost 85% Chinese.
00:07:42.185 - 00:07:46.825, Speaker C: I didn't even really think that there were maybe 100% that many like as a category.
00:07:46.945 - 00:07:47.249, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:47.297 - 00:07:53.177, Speaker C: And then you realize, oh, like there aren't, I guess from the other races it's just all of the Chinese women, right?
00:07:53.281 - 00:07:54.361, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:07:54.433 - 00:08:13.323, Speaker C: So use that to say like, okay, well if the people who are using the donor sperm to have babies are all Chinese babies, billionaires who are typically like, they're, they're very well put together, very well spoken, very like thin. And you just advertise that in an American market, like you've already spun it as like an extreme giga premium.
00:08:13.379 - 00:08:13.875, Speaker D: Good, right.
00:08:13.915 - 00:08:31.003, Speaker C: Like it went from being this weird thing that like, oh, like it's associated with like, you know, you're too much of a loser cat lady to like find a husband with like now it's like, oh, this is better than like finding a husband. This is a bigger flexibility then. Yeah, actually pulled it off a traditional way.
00:08:31.139 - 00:09:11.275, Speaker A: I was actually discussing, yeah, like I was discussing this with my, with my Jewish American friend in Bali actually a few weeks ago and he said like, you know how, you know, there's some societies where as soon as they have any kind of ability to have a child, they will have it. It doesn't matter if they have no savings, no money, like nothing, they'll start having kids. Right. And I won't name them. But he named a bunch of civilizations that you thought were of that nature. And then you said, if you think about China, it's like this highly eugenics driven society for thousands of years where the idea is if you can't bring a child in a good situation, then you shouldn't bring it in at all. And so there's that kind of concept.
00:09:11.275 - 00:10:00.355, Speaker A: And so I think that's one part of it where, because there's that wealth inequality and urbanization, a lot of people think, well, if I haven't already bought a place and I don't have, you know, my, my stuff in order, I shouldn't be being, bringing life into this stressful world. Right? And so that's like a huge part of it. Huge in Korea is a huge part of it. And I think that the second part of it is like I mentioned before, it's just that women are very successful now, especially compared to the average man. If you look at just pure demographics of working people, a lot of men are not in work. So there's that big displacement and then I think that, you know, in Korea you have the 4B movement, it's called, which is like, you know, a post male society. They talk about how society in the future should be, should have no men in it, which is kind of really interesting concept.
00:10:00.355 - 00:10:23.745, Speaker A: So I think you get that fracturing of politics as well that comes along with that. So I think, you know, you're seeing these trends actually not just in Asia, you're seeing them in Europe as well. Like look at birth rates. Even in like countries like Italy, it's very, very low, even in Mediterranean places. So I don't think it's unique to Asia. Japan, which is known for low birth rates, actually isn't that low. I think it's on par with most European countries right now.
00:10:23.745 - 00:10:58.735, Speaker A: The ones that are really low is like mainland China, some parts, especially northern parts, Southern's a bit higher. But yeah, it's all coming down to what is the point of life. I think for a lot of people. When do we bring life into this world? Why do we bring life into this world? So I think that, you know, it's like now, I think in Korea they're giving people 36k bonus as soon as they get married. They're giving them also baby bonuses. The amounts are getting bigger and bigger. So, you know, you're not far from a society where people may start to get paid just to reproduce.
00:10:58.735 - 00:11:03.691, Speaker A: So I think all these trends are kind of going to come together that way.
00:11:03.803 - 00:11:26.209, Speaker B: But I see, I seen this. Let me see if I can find it. I've got like a thousand tabs open. But it was like arguing against paid incentive over status incentive. So this guy's like, let me see if I can zoom in here. So South Korea spent over $200 billion trying to increase its birthday. Hungary spends 5% of his GDP.
00:11:26.209 - 00:12:14.221, Speaker B: Both fail and yet the small country of Georgia spiked in its birth rate massively without spending a dollar. It basically goes into argue it's all about kind of status games. So kind of elevating families that are going into three and four like births and then there's like different kind of statues. So I think one of the highest, let me see someone in very kind of high power within the local religion would basically said he would be, he'd baptize any fourth child in a family and he'd personally be like equivalent to like a godfather for them and shit like that. So that goes into that. And there was also like this Mongolian one as well, where I saw that one. Yeah, that was really cool.
00:12:14.221 - 00:12:34.695, Speaker B: So like anyone who's like coming in call. So elevating the status of motherhood solves lo bar. It's the extraordinary case of Mongolia and basically like tldr of it. For 68 years, Mongolian leaders have given the order of maternal glory to mothers, raising the status of motherhood and health. Remarkable pro natal culture. And then you can kind of see the. It's definitely significant.
00:12:35.795 - 00:13:12.861, Speaker A: Yeah. Like Peter Thiel touched on this in his recent Rogan podcast where he says there's this way in which low birth rate begets low birth rate and high birth rate begets high birth rate. And you brought up the example of it like Israel, which has higher birth rates. And it's like, you know, if all your friends have kids and then you're the one who doesn't, you're kind of like an out, like ostracized. You're seen as like, you know, not contributing to society. Whereas if you're in like South Korea he mentioned like, and everyone around you is single and no one has any kids, then like when you have a kid, you become ostracized. And so there's that way where, you know, I think for Georgia and for Mongolia, it's like, can be very pro, like making the mother this figure.
00:13:12.861 - 00:13:33.145, Speaker A: But you think about like in, even in the States or like especially in places where the birth rate is already so low and you just have like maybe 90% of women not having a child at like age 30, then you're gonna have a very difficult time elevating the minority into the majority. Like it's, it's like how, you know, women don't like to have like, you know, if there's a supermodel, then they say we. That's an unrealistic standard.
00:13:33.185 - 00:13:33.361, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:33.393 - 00:13:38.385, Speaker A: I think you can have the same problem of saying, here's a mother, we should all like be impressed with her happening.
00:13:38.425 - 00:13:48.273, Speaker C: Actually, you know, like with all the videos and tiktoks of like they're sort of trying to do that where they'll have some very like hyper rich family showing the like trad housewife scenario.
00:13:48.329 - 00:13:48.521, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:48.553 - 00:13:49.871, Speaker C: But everybody looks at that now and.
00:13:49.913 - 00:13:54.363, Speaker A: Nobody'S saying like people get mad, right? Like it's an epic home unrealistic, like.
00:13:54.379 - 00:14:17.425, Speaker C: Achieve on my own. It's like this is only able to be seen by people who have like $15 liquid. They can hire like three servants to do various things and like prepare the, you know, like the food on the homestead or take care of the cows because like the, the trad wife, like the cute like flower dress. It's she's not the one going out and milk the cows at 4 in the morning, right?
00:14:18.245 - 00:14:27.277, Speaker B: It's like, what this is, this is all what men want. Like those memes that come across the timeline, it's like everyone, they don't even actually want it.
00:14:27.301 - 00:14:28.145, Speaker C: That's the thing.
00:14:30.165 - 00:14:30.941, Speaker A: Very true.
00:14:31.053 - 00:15:00.047, Speaker C: All these like, natalism conferences and stuff like that. But like, they're actually not reproducing, right? Like, they'll the same men that are going to like the trad con. Natal con and stuff. They get a girlfriend and they'll date her for like four years. And she's like sitting here like, looking at her empty ring finger and the guy's like, ah, yeah, I don't know, man. Like maybe next year. And then in like four years they break up and she's just like, what the dude? Like, I.
00:15:00.047 - 00:15:14.885, Speaker C: I watched, I dated him as he sat there writing for like six blogs about how he wanted to have like a conservative trad family with like eight kids and I have no ring now. And he just like fucking like went off and he's dating some podcaster now. Like, what the.
00:15:16.425 - 00:15:51.705, Speaker A: There was a. There was a provincial governor in, I think, song dynasty. And what he did was like, egregious, or not egregious, but like aggressive, where he basically created law where you had to get married before 20 and you had to have your first child before 21. And they. He also banned like, age gaps, so you couldn't have an age gap of over, like a certain number of years because at that time they were like under threat from the Mongol hordes from the north. And they were like, we needed to create lots of good soldiers, good fighters and change the norms. And so he did that within one or two generations.
00:15:51.705 - 00:16:15.295, Speaker A: And that was seen as a really, really aggressive thing. But you almost need to mandate it. You almost need to mandate it. You have to BE at age 18, you have to marry your high school sweetheart and have your first child. Only then can you go to college. Like, you'd have to do that bit basically to fix it. Because like you said, like, the norms are just so far now that like, and it's men and women that people just really push it very, very far into the future.
00:16:15.295 - 00:16:54.223, Speaker A: And egg freezing actually is a trend which ironically makes that even more into the future because it's something that, you know, how like, 30s, the new 2040s, the new 30s is like a common concept for people like that permanent adulthood. You know, you can be adulting for, you know, very, very long time or thinking that you're not an adult. So pretending to not be an adult for a very long time, I think. Yeah, yeah. So I think that's all very, it's all very bearish birth rate. Like I don't actually think you can turn around without government intervention or without kind of huge, very well funded cabal or something.
00:16:54.319 - 00:16:54.623, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:54.679 - 00:17:08.339, Speaker C: It doesn't matter whether it's a government or like a private group of like, there's a lot of people in like the, the Bay Area, like tech scene or something like that who can go and in their little circles create some sort of like a high fertility, like poly.
00:17:08.467 - 00:17:19.055, Speaker B: Isn't. Isn't Elon doing that or is he just keep getting caught cheating? Like he keeps, like he's. I don't know whether is he. It's because he wants to do it.
00:17:21.315 - 00:17:30.965, Speaker C: It seems that he's realized he can't just openly say like, I want to have like 1 million children by the time I'm dead, but that's obviously what he's going for.
00:17:31.865 - 00:17:35.125, Speaker B: Or, or he's just like super horny and just keeps getting caught out.
00:17:35.905 - 00:17:43.113, Speaker C: Oh, I mean, I think he does the donor stuff too. Like, I think he's just in any possible. It's like, oh, if I can make more kids mind, then yeah, I'm gonna do it.
00:17:43.249 - 00:17:44.073, Speaker B: Well, who is.
00:17:44.129 - 00:17:44.601, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:44.713 - 00:17:46.737, Speaker B: Wasn't it Pavel Durov?
00:17:46.801 - 00:18:16.395, Speaker A: Didn't that Pavel himself also? Yeah, he created a sperm bank in Russia where he's the sole donor, I think. And it's like over a hundred, over a hundred have been produced. There's a Netflix documentary as well about a Dutch guy who kind of armed the sperm bank system. Like he created fake IDs or whatever because you can only donate. You can only get your sperm used 10 times at each sperm bank. So he like basically kept doing this. And the Netflix documentary is very negative on him, obviously, and rightly so, but.
00:18:16.435 - 00:18:21.357, Speaker B: He'S not preventing like reduction of gene pool because too much spam in there.
00:18:21.501 - 00:18:42.397, Speaker A: Ostensibly they talk about, you know, incest risk, but I think it's also just like it's unsightly. I think it's societally unsightly to think that this guy's, you know, got. But in the US it's 25. That's the American medical guideline. In Europe is mostly 10. In like Singapore, Hong Kong, it's like 1 to 3. So, you know, that's why you have no real sperm banks in these areas.
00:18:42.397 - 00:19:06.055, Speaker A: Because even if you got the sperm bank, you can only create one child from it locally. So. But Yeah, I think that there's an interesting, there's an interesting market for offshore sperm banks also for decentralized sperm banks because you can potentially collect a much higher caliber of sperm also sperm, when you freeze it, it lasts forever, it lasts centuries. So highly investable. Highly investable.
00:19:07.795 - 00:19:23.019, Speaker C: No, sue first told me about oh yeah, it just lasts forever. And I was like what? Like forever? And it's like, you know, normally you Google stuff like this and it says like, well it has like a degradation rate of like this percent or like it gets this much worse every like time period.
00:19:23.067 - 00:19:23.419, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:23.507 - 00:19:28.935, Speaker C: But then you Google it with sperm and it literally just says like yeah, it just lasts forever. It's like, it's like unlimited.
00:19:30.195 - 00:19:44.877, Speaker B: What, what are some of the. I suppose if there is a market for it, is there any kind of like anecdotal evidence or like hard evidence on like characteristics like what people are kind of like, even if it's demographic or physical or.
00:19:44.941 - 00:19:46.205, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the money.
00:19:46.365 - 00:19:48.741, Speaker C: There's going to be a weird global difference, right?
00:19:48.893 - 00:19:49.245, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:49.285 - 00:20:30.527, Speaker A: I mean most women want to buy in a way that is they can hide the fact that it's sperm, that a sperm donor. So they usually buy their same ethnicity. They usually buy like the, in the articles down in the, in the Guardian, like, like she's Greek so she wants to buy Greek. So you have very specific trade stuff that people often go for. I think that it's actually not clear how much the market would expand. So right now one of the biggest firm banks, California Cryo and they have four campus sites where they recruit on campus. And so they get, they try to get like the college grad, the higher IQ kind of pitch, maybe college athletes.
00:20:30.527 - 00:21:00.831, Speaker A: But even in those cases they're mainly doing ads on social media and they're doing ads on the subway and they're offering people hundreds of dollars. Right. So it's not like they're offering huge incentives really. It's more like if you're really bored, 19 year old, you want the money, you can try and they actually only, they only pay you if someone uses your sperm. So and the sperm donor acceptance rate is 1%. So it's very, very low. So actually when you go to donate sperm in like one of those places or they sell sperm, you're actually the likelihood of you getting paid is very, very low.
00:21:00.831 - 00:22:03.351, Speaker A: So it's almost like a lottery system. So it's not really incentivizing higher quality. So I think an interesting concept is almost intent driven where a woman is saying I want global search for these Traits, this one. And then men can kind of come up and say here, I offer you this, here will be the terms. I also think there's going to be interesting models for not daos but kind of cooperatives that like have child, child support funds together. Like you know, someone like Elon would probably, you know, if he's very pronatalist, he might say okay, if you use my sperm then I will give you some like Elon scholarship. Conversely, you can have like situation where people, you know, use that model to, to you know, experiment with, with different types of like, you know, there is not, there's a, I think there's a danger with some of this from being seen as eugenics, but it's really not.
00:22:03.351 - 00:22:23.473, Speaker A: Right. It's more about just choice, it's about preference. Right. And you know, it's also like trait, like trait driven dating would actually be more honest than let's say looks dating. Like purely looks based dating. Right? Because traits driven would be let's say like 100 year genetic, 100 year compatibility. Whereas you know, pure looks based.
00:22:23.473 - 00:23:16.695, Speaker A: Like it's very, it's very, it's very imprecise. So the problem right now people have is that it's too many. So you could even see this evolve into like eventually being like an actual dating market where, or like a dating site where people like she could like global search for traits, find those traits and then even not just try to buy the sperm but also try to date the guy. So I think it should be, you know, I think we're entering that kind of like female driven world. Like I think one of the founders of Hinge was on a sperm bank site and then the sperm bank site saw that basically or the sperm bank site had audio clips of the donors. So she saw that feature and then she added it into Hinge as well because she was so impressed by it. But yeah, so most of these sperm banks, you know, they give you like simple like profiles, nothing too fancy and audio clip at most, most are undocs.
00:23:16.695 - 00:23:26.471, Speaker A: Some can be doxed if you pay more. But that's the lay of the land. I think it's ripe for disruption. I think it's ripe for new, new kind of models of doing that.
00:23:26.623 - 00:23:44.465, Speaker C: It removes kind of like the hardest barrier to dating which is the actual like liking of the people. You know, if you just go into a checklist wise, right? Like who's a good checklist guy? There's a lot of good checklist guys, right. If you don't have to like with them or love them or whatever, then it's.
00:23:44.585 - 00:23:45.937, Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
00:23:46.121 - 00:23:47.845, Speaker C: There's a big market for that.
00:23:48.145 - 00:23:49.561, Speaker A: Absolutely, absolutely.
00:23:49.713 - 00:24:19.535, Speaker C: What's been, do you think the moat, I guess that's prevented anybody from attacking this is a global market because it seems like it's something that you would really obviously go after globally because you know, if there's limits on every locality in terms of oh, you can only donate like 10 times in this country or 10 times in this country or 25 or whatever, why wouldn't you just naturally say wait, I have to be able to, I have to be able to take something from every global market or else this is not sustainable at scale.
00:24:19.955 - 00:24:30.819, Speaker A: I think the number one thing is I think women's voices need to be heard. Like, I think that right now, you know, there are a lot of women just very quietly buying sperm, using it, raising kids.
00:24:30.907 - 00:24:31.203, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:31.259 - 00:25:37.415, Speaker A: That's already happening in size. That's why it's already multiple in our market. However, for the stigma to kind of come out of that and for that to be not just like an ODC broker market plus like traditional sperm bank, but to be like, you know, more commercializable, I think you need that kind of destigmatization which I think is happening very quickly right now, mainly as a new generation comes into having their voice heard. I think that also you have this really interesting trend of what are like if you think about kind of the woke top being in and then like what comes next and like what people do. I think there's an interesting hybridity where you know, the like what a woman wants out of like a dating market or out of something versus what she claims she wants is very different. Right. Like a, like a liberal woman may want, may claim she wants certain things, but when you look at her dating preferences or her like self presences, they're extremely specific and extremely, you know.
00:25:37.415 - 00:26:31.739, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So, you know, I think that this kind of stuff over time is, it desensitizes, you know, like right now you, you already have like, you know, women will say like I have a height cut off and I have this kind of cut off for like income, all kind of stuff. And I think that you know, in all societies this is already normal. So as this becomes like if there's a way they can actually put it into action and then say, you know, we don't need men anymore, but I'm still gonna have a child. That is something that could go mainstream as a, as a form of, you know, so it's like, you know, instead of the woman raising a cat on her own or a dog on her own, she may actually raise a baby on her own, right? Like, I went to a boarding nursery, so I was from one to one and a half to about like, you're actually at a boarding school. That's actually very normal at the time in Beijing. But, I mean, now it'd be considered less common.
00:26:31.739 - 00:27:02.205, Speaker A: But you could have these models in the future where, you know, they could bring that back in China, they could bring that back in Korea, where it's like, people are being raised almost by community, like by a village. And then the woman can still work, she can still have her, you know, her job. Like, I think that that configuration of, like, the woman having it all, I think is key to natalism. I think if you don't create those conditions, the woman's going to be like, you know what? I feel submerged, but at the same time, I don't care. Right. And that's really kind of the. Kind of the thing.
00:27:02.205 - 00:27:30.943, Speaker A: I think surrogacy is also something that's part of that discussion. As surrogacy costs come low enough, eventually, you know, career women will, you know, not only buy the sperm, but they'll also not, you know, carry the child themselves. They'll use surrogate. A lot of that market has been driven by LGBT demand. And then now it's become a very common thing for, especially for Chinese to have a child in, like, California, and then the child gets passport as well. So I think that's. That's something that, you know, California, being the most liberal, is kind of really pro.
00:27:30.943 - 00:28:12.065, Speaker A: And I think that that's something that also is like, you know, I think there was more stigma on surrogacy maybe 10 years ago, and now it's seen as like, you know, a lot of celebrities have done it, and then it's become almost aspirational as opposed to, like, well, I can't believe she did that. So I think that, you know, those trends are going that direction, and I think that you're going to see eventually, like, governments who want higher birth rates to be really supportive of this and say, you know what? I don't care how you have this kid. I don't care what sperm you brought in. I don't care, you know, I really don't care. If you're going to have a child and this child is a citizen and they're going to, like, eventually, you know, maybe serve in the army or, like, you know, help contribute to gdp, then let's do it. So I think that major shift is going to happen over the next five, ten years.
00:28:12.875 - 00:28:13.371, Speaker C: America.
00:28:13.403 - 00:28:13.571, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:13.603 - 00:28:25.571, Speaker C: Like, if people are willing to say, yeah, let's bring in like tens of millions of immigrants, why would you not just say, like, yeah, you can go and surrogate your baby, you can go and use donor sperm, you know.
00:28:25.763 - 00:28:46.731, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. Yeah. So you're seeing a number of countries start to explore legalizing surrogacy. Like right now, like Ukraine and California are the two big markets. But you know, that, that can, you know, I think within a few years you may see that being very common everywhere. Um, and you know that that cost of surrogacy can go lower and lower to the point where that, that market is actually interesting.
00:28:46.763 - 00:28:46.931, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:46.963 - 00:29:06.261, Speaker C: Because I do think that the donor sperm thing is going to be massive upward trend. Like, it seems that we are basically like at the cusp of exponential acceleration of things like donor sperm, gene editing of babies, stuff like that becoming very mainstream. But I do think also that a lot of this is going to rely on surrogate because of what you were.
00:29:06.293 - 00:29:08.013, Speaker A: Saying, like the women gene. Yeah.
00:29:08.189 - 00:29:21.805, Speaker C: Their own babies. But like, that's a weird market too now. Because basically what is going to happen is in order for that to open up at a global scale, like the actual carrying of a child has to be elevated now to a sort of lower status thing.
00:29:21.845 - 00:29:22.045, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:22.085 - 00:29:31.879, Speaker C: Like there's going to be a cast between like the women who can afford to not carry their own kids and the women who are being paid to birth other people's children.
00:29:31.967 - 00:29:32.595, Speaker D: Right?
00:29:34.535 - 00:29:35.315, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:35.975 - 00:29:38.395, Speaker B: It's like huntsman's tale kind of.
00:29:39.095 - 00:29:40.007, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:29:40.111 - 00:29:49.175, Speaker C: And that I think is going to have like. Yeah, like obviously that's a very up social effect that's going to emerge. And yeah, I mean, to be very country specific too.
00:29:49.215 - 00:29:49.391, Speaker D: Right.
00:29:49.423 - 00:30:01.121, Speaker C: Like certain countries are basically going to become like, like birth pens for other countries. And then also, like, if this does reach any point of like global saturation.
00:30:01.193 - 00:30:01.425, Speaker D: Right.
00:30:01.465 - 00:30:20.129, Speaker C: Like, who are these people that are going to be having the babies? You know, like, if everybody is relying on the surrogates to have their. Like, where are the surrogates that are putting up with like the 8 billion, you know, like, okay, it's half and it's not gonna be everyone, but like, you get what I'm saying, You know.
00:30:20.177 - 00:30:21.485, Speaker B: Played out to the extreme.
00:30:22.515 - 00:31:06.187, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think on the gene editing point, I'm kind of bearish on gene editing being approved because I think, I mean, in terms of like, I mean, you saw what happened with CRISPR and with in China. I mean, I think that gene editing is arguably much more controversial than sperm donor. Than sperm. I mean, sperm donor, what you're simply doing is the woman is using an alternative route to attract the genetic material to have a child. Right? And then embryo selection there's a little bit controversial, but still not that controversial because you're simply, I mean these embryos are alive and you're selecting the best, like the most fit of let's say, five, ten embryos. When you get into gene editing, you're, you're getting into a trickier part of bioethics.
00:31:06.187 - 00:31:43.797, Speaker A: I mean, it's not, there's no area effects, right? So from a point of view of like bioethics saying, okay, can this hurt other people? Maybe not. But I think that you're not going to see like fast legalization of like gene editing on embryos. Like that. That's illegal right now, like almost everywhere and I think probably will continue to be so. Whereas like sperm donor, like when you, when you as a woman, you buy the sperm, you can even so you can do it processed or unprocessed, right? So unprocessed means that they deliver. Like you get the sperm and you put it inside yourself to like natural insemination. And you know, like, there's no law in the world that can ban you from putting sperm in your body.
00:31:43.797 - 00:31:58.285, Speaker A: Like, it's not. There's. You couldn't create a law like that, right? It wouldn't make any sense. So, you know, you, you kind of get that basic, you get the ability to take sperm donor from like very basic freedoms that you already have. Whereas, like, that's not the case.
00:31:58.405 - 00:32:01.821, Speaker C: I'm thinking what the law would take the form of. And it would literally have to be.
00:32:01.853 - 00:32:06.421, Speaker A: Like, you must know who sperm it is that you're a woman.
00:32:06.493 - 00:32:13.715, Speaker C: Like, the man has to put it there himself by some function of his own bodily autonomy or something, right? Like.
00:32:15.935 - 00:32:20.875, Speaker A: That would, that would be hard to enforce. It'd be like, it'd be hard.
00:32:22.815 - 00:32:28.268, Speaker B: Did you, did you see this, do you see this 23andMe scam that happened previously?
00:32:28.381 - 00:32:31.595, Speaker A: You mean the 23Me site itself?
00:32:32.015 - 00:32:32.631, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:32.743 - 00:32:35.893, Speaker A: It went insolvent, right? I think so.
00:32:36.039 - 00:33:01.587, Speaker B: So, like, if anyone's listening. So this, this random account popped up on, on Twitter and at the time, it still doesn't have a lot of followers in this, this wasn't that long ago. So. Hello, Twitter peeps. My friend Elizabeth is looking for some unvaxed sperm donor. Her requirements are blue eyes, white 5 11, atoller, std 3, no Jewish African ancestry, follows a health healthy meat Focused diet must be natural insemination. She will not do ivf.
00:33:01.587 - 00:33:20.055, Speaker B: So as this unfolds, here are our details. Reads out all the details. Obviously sounds like, you know, the ideal kind of woman. And then this, this account gets inundated with kind of dms which like she shows here. It's just like literally thousands, thousands of.
00:33:20.135 - 00:33:28.205, Speaker C: My friend sending her the N word. My friend, like everyone here is like.
00:33:29.665 - 00:33:45.713, Speaker B: So, so the genius running a viral marketing app. Yeah, the genius in this is she says for you to meet the requirements of her friend, you have to fill in this 23andMe kit where she's got an affiliate link. So every person who buys it, she gets a 20.
00:33:45.809 - 00:33:46.725, Speaker A: I saw this.
00:33:50.345 - 00:33:53.445, Speaker B: Kind of, I kind of respect it, but it's.
00:33:54.005 - 00:34:18.365, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean you could do that now with, you could do that kind of a similar thing with Legacy. So Legacy is a US based male sperm kit model. They have 25,000 customers. But basically the idea is that they'll send you a kit. You can like take your sperm sample at home by yourself and you can mail it back to them and then they'll analyze it for you. They'll analyze the motility. They'll also freeze it for you in biobanks for a few hundred dollars a year.
00:34:18.365 - 00:34:37.153, Speaker A: That, that kind of a model, you could do the same where it could be like, you know, as the woman, I want your sperm sample. And then like I, I may use it in the future. Like I made like I may, like once I'm ready, I need it. But meanwhile you're paying Legacy to freeze your sperm. I mean it's, it'll probably work. Similarly does that.
00:34:37.209 - 00:35:01.301, Speaker B: There's the, I can't remember the name. I think it's a US based company where they're effectively offering the ivf. I don't know if it's free, but it's, it's a drastic discount. But the like, the kind of trade off is whatever they harvest, other than what they're going to use, they're going to get to keep. Which I don't really know how I think about that one, to be honest. It's a bit, that is.
00:35:01.413 - 00:35:41.041, Speaker C: Yeah, that was something that I thought also was going to be one of these sort of like horror story markets that emerges because like you have people saying like, I'm getting to the point where it's like this stops becoming an option for me in the future, but like, I don't have the money to do it on my own. Like you are, you are sort of putting people at like a gun to your head scenario here where they're willing to do like a lot of like ethically very gray things. And you know, if you get a woman who says like me, like I have like three months left of like being able to like actually produce a child, they're like, yeah, they would start like selling parts of their body effectively.
00:35:41.113 - 00:35:41.705, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:41.865 - 00:35:50.017, Speaker C: So. And there are a lot of like medical models that people have come up with this stuff for like pretend it's not like selling it.
00:35:50.041 - 00:35:50.201, Speaker D: Right.
00:35:50.233 - 00:36:10.347, Speaker C: Like everybody on every college campus is familiar with biolife and the way that they say, yeah, like come like donate your, your blood or your blood plasma, right. But it's not donating. You know, you're, you, you're selling it to them, right? Like everybody. The only reason people do bio life is because they give you hundreds of dollars. So is that donating?
00:36:10.451 - 00:36:12.683, Speaker A: You know, like, I think, yeah, bodily.
00:36:12.739 - 00:36:14.523, Speaker C: Fluids if you're paying me hundreds.
00:36:14.699 - 00:36:24.835, Speaker A: The other thing that like donating blood, they've been good at gaslighting is they've gaslight people into saying donating blood is so good for your health. Like it just cleans out your system. You got to keep doing it, right. Like you see it everywhere.
00:36:24.915 - 00:36:27.715, Speaker C: Oh yeah. Men need to do it because they have to lower their hematocrit levels.
00:36:27.755 - 00:36:28.033, Speaker D: Right?
00:36:28.099 - 00:36:33.861, Speaker C: Your, your higher needs. There's just too much of it, bro. You've got to give or else you're going to die.
00:36:33.933 - 00:36:34.549, Speaker D: Right?
00:36:34.717 - 00:36:40.665, Speaker B: Yeah. Meanwhile they're just injecting it into like Brian Johnson or fucking Keith Richards or something to keep him alive.
00:36:42.765 - 00:37:02.871, Speaker C: Using it to you know, like deriving like platelet rich plasma from it or like all these other weird things that, you know, it's, it's painted as you saying, wow, it's so amazing that like men can go and do this thing that it's going to prolong their health and it's going to go and it's going to save people.
00:37:02.943 - 00:37:03.199, Speaker D: Right?
00:37:03.247 - 00:37:19.935, Speaker C: Like there's like these orphans like bleeding out in the streets. They need a blood transfusion and then it's actually just like Brian Johnson, 16 liters of human blood every day with his various like new age health protocols.
00:37:21.105 - 00:37:23.245, Speaker A: I think, I wonder if they'll be similar.
00:37:24.865 - 00:37:59.175, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead. I think the way that the kind of male fertility kind of health rate is falling off a cliff as well. I think there was a study not too long ago, only 25% of male sperm on average was considered healthy and healthy and effective. I think there's probably going to be what we've seen with egg freezing as well. As males become more conscious around it, they're gonna have to kind of think about that a lot earlier in life now because it seems to be there's that many external factors.
00:38:00.355 - 00:38:00.859, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:00.907 - 00:38:49.143, Speaker C: For men matter too. Like, you know, like, we love all of the egg carton posting and like that. Like, everybody loves giving women for like, oh, you're hitting the wall, etc, etc. But like, the same stuff happens for men and women. It's just been like, well, like, men don't have it because you can keep like a guy at like 70 years old can keep impregnating people and it's like, well, I mean, yeah, you can impregnate them, but it's going to be like weird autism reviews from your autism sperm, right? And there are a lot of things that go into this that actually are very impactful on the quality of the sperm. And like, you know, like a good one that was brought up in the group chat is saunas. You know, like, if you're going and having a lot of saunas, you're basically cooking your and denaturing the sperm proteins to the point where it's like, ah, you don't really want to do that.
00:38:49.143 - 00:38:51.647, Speaker C: And you know, like, it's the same.
00:38:51.671 - 00:38:54.079, Speaker A: With finesse or like any supplements, right?
00:38:54.207 - 00:39:50.379, Speaker C: Like, or like all of the steroid stuff. And people will say, oh, well, you can still have babies on finasteride, like, I had mine. And it's like, yeah, you can, dude. But like, you're fucking up your hormonal profile to the point where the babies that you have are like, maybe they're not coming out, like, explicitly retarded, but there is going to be some, some impact, right? Like your kids are going to be worse. And when you start actually like telling people that, you know, like, you're engaging in this lifestyle that is like, functionally making your, your kids, your offspring, like, worse than they could. I think they are sort of forced to address it now. And the sperm markets do that on their own because women are going to look at sperm of that quality and just say, like, why the would I want it, right? Like, why would I pay money for sperm of some guy who's like, on all these pharmaceuticals and he's unhealthy and he's not doing anything to like, you know, fix it.
00:39:50.379 - 00:40:26.315, Speaker C: Whereas you have like the Soul bra, right, the soul bra sperm where he is out doing everything. He hasn't gone anywhere that has like radiation higher than, you know, like the. What, what was the, like a series a like Wi Fi router within like 100 meters over the last five decades of his life, you know, he hasn't seen an induction ever. Perfect, untouched. And then you have like me, right, like podcasting in this nest of wires and all like flowing through my balls and God knows what's going on here. Finasteride, like.
00:40:28.335 - 00:40:30.555, Speaker B: Villain lines of finasteride in the morning.
00:40:34.935 - 00:40:35.287, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:35.311 - 00:41:17.959, Speaker B: But I, I think people get a real shock because obviously like any, anyone who did like a, a test like sperm sample analysis and got kind of got their results back, if they were kind of planning around having kids or if they just left it up to chance, like towards maybe their, their wife of the partners at like late stages of their fertility cycle and stuff like that. I think there's going to be a lot of people that get caught out by surprise with stuff like that. So I, I just think they should be, you know, go, go and kind of test it as early as physically possible. And if you're in a good kind of state, then look at. It's not exact exactly expensive to depending on your situation really is really inexpensive actually.
00:41:18.007 - 00:41:34.439, Speaker C: So I was like, I was meming around a little. I've actually played around with this. I'm a little. My. Isn't that up? We do like to keep on top of the sperm game here, but there are a lot of things that impact it like really, really quickly with men.
00:41:34.487 - 00:41:34.671, Speaker D: Right.
00:41:34.703 - 00:42:09.779, Speaker C: Like, I don't know what it is for eggs, but I think that the effects are more like long term. But for sperm, you know, if you are to optimize your T levels in some way or just your hormonal profile, you stop taking some drug. Even just going out and like getting more sun for like two weeks actually does have like a very immediate effect on your sperm because they're created so quickly and it's such like a quickly refreshing process that you actually can do a lot to bring stuff up in a very short amount of time.
00:42:09.827 - 00:42:10.011, Speaker D: Right.
00:42:10.043 - 00:42:22.615, Speaker C: Like there's, there's a kit like you could basically write a PDF for men that has like the top 10 things that you can do and you, you will probably be able to at least double the quality of their sperm if they do them all for like a month.
00:42:23.515 - 00:42:23.867, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:23.891 - 00:42:56.565, Speaker B: So sauna is a big one as you're saying in the, in the, in the chart. That's, that can seriously. Not that it's kind of permanent, but if you're kind of planning and again pushing like the later stages of like a couple's fertility cycle, like that's going to take at least 75 probably 60 to 75 days for like completely non denatured reset of like what's, what's coming out of there. So but like, but then it's, it's like the opposite side of that is everyone's telling you getting a fucking sauna 40 million hours of the day at the same time.
00:42:56.695 - 00:43:04.725, Speaker C: Yeah, like, like it's the health, it's the health hack that fixes everything but also it like fries your, fries your balls.
00:43:05.265 - 00:43:10.217, Speaker A: My friends who do the infrared, the infrared sauna, like that can't be good for you, right? I don't know.
00:43:10.321 - 00:43:32.965, Speaker B: Well, yeah, exactly. It's still, it's, it's still UV, it's still radiation even though it might be 60 degrees. Like all you need to denature your protein is like 40 degrees consistent exposure. That's when proteins start denaturing and like the folding of the proteins start getting fucked up. Mobility, morphology, how viral they are. It's like. So yeah, knock that on the head if anyone's listening.
00:43:32.965 - 00:43:36.645, Speaker B: Who's wanting to get a kid on the way.
00:43:36.805 - 00:43:42.225, Speaker A: So what are Grant's like top five sperm tips? Like as an expert.
00:43:42.805 - 00:44:07.015, Speaker B: I'm not an expert but you need to like sauna is a big one. You need to like knock that on the head instantly. Exogenous testosterone, you probably need to start thinking about that. It's not kind of, it's not kind of proven that you can't actually go ahead and have a child to be doing that. Obesity is a huge factor that reduces concentration amount.
00:44:07.795 - 00:44:40.525, Speaker C: It's just obesity isn't even like, it's not even just one factor that does it like obesity you in every facet because it like adipose fat tissue is where you have the enzymes that not, not all of them, but it's where the majority of the concentration of the enzyme that actually converts your testosterone into the estrogens are. And so like your entire hormonal profile just gets giga merked if you're fat because you're cannibalizing your tea, turning it into estrogen and that has like that, that's where everything comes downstream from.
00:44:40.565 - 00:44:40.765, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:40.805 - 00:44:53.635, Speaker C: Like your testosterone then converts into like DHT and all the other androgens and stuff like this. And so now your whole profile is just broad spectrum bucked and it's, that's like one that you absolutely cannot do.
00:44:55.255 - 00:45:20.863, Speaker B: Yeah, like it's, it's, it's really easy like sleep in like low stress environments which is pretty difficult in our industry. But it's just like look after yourself and don't human Yourself too much human pill yourself too much and going in 200 degree saunas and shit like that. But like a lot of stuff is kind of reversible. If you start looking at yourself and like thinking right, is this the right decision to actually make?
00:45:20.879 - 00:45:29.235, Speaker A: What do you think about the cryo? What do you think about the cryo? You know what I mean? Like the cryo bath and the cryo freezer thing people do. What's your view on that?
00:45:30.375 - 00:46:10.785, Speaker B: Well, you wouldn't, you wouldn't like biologically speaking, you wouldn't expect that to be any damaging effects to like protein. It's all just about protein folding. How the pro, like how nucleic acids and protein folding actually comes out. And if it's folding in the correct ways and you create on the side proteins of what you actually want out of what the DNA is telling it to do. But if they get into like large scale proteins like obviously which like sperm is and you're starting to go like hotter and hotter temperatures or I think there was like some studies that didn't necessarily have like statistical significance where briefs or boxes and stuff like that. So even down to how it's. Because it's the temperature regulation of like of the balls really effectively.
00:46:10.785 - 00:46:22.561, Speaker B: But cold, cold exposure shouldn't like biologically and chemically speaking have, have too drastic of an effect. It's. It's more the temperature, the heat temperature. That's awesome.
00:46:22.713 - 00:47:17.749, Speaker C: Various, various drugs actually impact the rate of the. It's not really like a super. I'm trying to like say this in like the least vulgar way possible. The ball sacks ability to like contract and like expand to like raise and lower your testes away from the body because you know there is like, there's a range of temperatures that like are being sought there so that they don't get destroyed in the ways that you're describing. But someone was basically telling me that like you're your ball thermostat can be thrown off by various drugs and the result of that will be that like you. It's actually something that's. Overall a big problem with sperm is that there are things that you can do that like they get measured as decreasing your fertility because they make your sperm non viable as in they're not going to like be able to produce an embryo.
00:47:17.749 - 00:47:54.245, Speaker C: But then you also have things that make the quality worse without reducing its ability to fertilize that you know. So the first one everyone is familiar with when we talk about like the lowering of the fertility rate, that's what everyone is really Speaking of is like, what is your, like the sperm count in like a milliliter of sperm, right? And if it goes down, they're like, okay, well, your fertility is lowering. But what they have a harder time looking at is the quality of the sperm in that. And that I think is something that gets like, analyzed a lot in any sort of like, donor sperm environment.
00:47:55.945 - 00:48:10.113, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like this, this. There's even. There's even conditions. Like, I think it's. I think the word would be like polyzoo spermia, where you'd assume that like, high concentration of sperm would be really, really good.
00:48:10.249 - 00:48:10.495, Speaker A: But.
00:48:10.525 - 00:48:38.987, Speaker B: But then you get over competition, over competition for the egg, which is actually not great. And then you've also got like, stuff like agglutination, like how. What is the actual serum like? And then your tetrazoospermia and shit like that, where it's like abnormal shapes. Can they like, penetrate egg? Can they swim correctly? Like, so it's, it's not just like, how much load can I get out there? It doesn't work like that. It did be a lot easier.
00:48:39.051 - 00:48:51.159, Speaker C: But an R versus K selection thing I assume at some point too, right? Because, like, they are pretty, like, energetically intensive to produce. Actually, like, sperm is not. It's not free.
00:48:51.207 - 00:48:51.391, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:51.423 - 00:48:59.095, Speaker C: Like, it actually is really pulling a lot of like, nutrients and like, resources out of the human body. Which makes sense.
00:48:59.175 - 00:48:59.463, Speaker D: Right?
00:48:59.519 - 00:49:18.345, Speaker C: Like, if you're going to be investing genetically in yourself, it wouldn't just be like, oh, yeah, just dump all the seed oils and the, like, you know, the heavy metals, all that. Just put those in there, man. Like, you're gonna be wanting to take the most high quality of everything and.
00:49:18.385 - 00:49:37.681, Speaker B: Yeah, good, good, good fats. Like, every cell in the body is like a lipid layer around it. Like good proteins. Like, you don't be too low body fat. If you like training bodybuilding competitions and like that as well, that's kind of counterintuitive because that doesn't necessarily send out a signal to your body that you're in a really good reproductive state. And that happens for both male and female. You know, you can be.
00:49:37.681 - 00:49:41.765, Speaker B: Need a little bit of. A little bit of body fat on both sides.
00:49:42.305 - 00:49:43.153, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:43.329 - 00:49:45.485, Speaker A: So semen retention, you think it works.
00:49:46.345 - 00:50:19.935, Speaker C: It works. But like, you're. I. There's a thing where, like, I think everyone who's doing the donors for him stuff is going to realize very quickly that you, like, you don't want to be just like, okay, like, I haven't, like, I haven't ejaculated in seven years because you don't want the like seven year old dying grandpa swimming around in your balls. When you like go to give sperm, right? It's not going to be. You want to talk about like the autism. That's like how you get the autism sperm bro.
00:50:19.935 - 00:50:42.865, Speaker C: Terms of working, I'm saying like for the guys who are like going out and looking at stuff like this, like if you're looking up semen retention like it works for whatever you're looking up for, right? Like just mentally, you know. And if you don't think that it works then it's not going to work for you. But again you're not looking it up and you don't give a then so.
00:50:43.205 - 00:50:50.167, Speaker A: You think it's like all placebo effect basically it's like a, it's like a will. It's like a manifestation of your will. It's like a willpower game.
00:50:50.301 - 00:51:33.155, Speaker C: I think that that is very like large as an effect. But I think also that we're getting to the point now where like I was saying like it is very resource intensive to produce sperm and I think like a lot of men are just like sort of low life force and you when you add in the fact of like they had, they're like jacking off like five times every day and now they're also trying to produce these like very high energy like sperms all the time and like do anything else in their life. Like I just don't, I don't see it happening man. Like these people aren't even getting out to fucking like exercise on a daily basis. They, they simply don't have enough spare energy to be just coming it out.
00:51:35.775 - 00:52:11.379, Speaker A: You know what would be a crazy like come to earn model would be if you had like a proven regularity, like it proved that you weren't like masturbating like six times a day. Like you could do that and then I mean it'd be marketed like 16 year old boys I guess like 20 year old boys but 20 year old guys. But basically it's just like, like if you could ascertain those commitments to like semi. No, I mean it's not no fap obviously but it's like semi nofap. I don't know, it could be big. It could be big.
00:52:11.427 - 00:52:20.695, Speaker C: Really funny also to have like a sperm donor company pushing like semen retention. This is like hold up, wait, like.
00:52:24.115 - 00:52:28.987, Speaker B: Can we just go straight to the problem instead of seems to be like.
00:52:29.091 - 00:53:19.995, Speaker C: Not very efficient in this case, sir. Like the capitalists might have lied about this One. But I think the funniest possible situation would be one where like, you. Based on how, like, based on your life force, like, let's say like the world's most virile man, right? Like Soulbra can donate like, samples per day or something, right? Because he's just overflowing with like, life force and energy. And then you just have like the ultimate, like, soy Jack who, like, he can only build up enough energy to produce like one good sperm every like two years, right? So they. They say you can only donate once every decade, you know, so like, what if every guy gets certified based on like, how many samples they can do in like a year or something? And the more that you can give, the higher tier your life force.
00:53:20.935 - 00:53:37.743, Speaker A: Yeah, like, you could assemble this massive. You know how they have these seed banks that are like in the Arctic and stuff for the apocalypse which is coming. You could have that with sperm as well. You could have like decentralized, like, biobanks all over the world. Could be big.
00:53:37.879 - 00:53:40.595, Speaker B: Do you think they have. Do you think they have to be offshore soon?
00:53:41.575 - 00:53:59.993, Speaker A: Yeah, they don't have to be offshore now. They can be anywhere. I mean, you. You can legally freeze your experiment. And even when you put it in a, like a biobank, you still own it. It's like, unlike when you use a real bank, like you put your cash in a bank, you don't really own it in the same way anymore. But when you put your sperm in a bank, you actually still own the biomatter.
00:53:59.993 - 00:54:04.457, Speaker A: So, you know, like, you have title to it. I guess you can.
00:54:04.521 - 00:54:30.563, Speaker C: My first thought when we were talking about that, I think I said that exact thing. I was like, wait a minute, dude. I have more ownership over my donated sperm Weird private companies than I do over my US dollars that I give to the local bank. This is so up. No, but I also don't get that sweet, sweet point.025 interest on my sperm.
00:54:30.619 - 00:54:42.587, Speaker A: Like, imagine, like, imagine you get like you earn yield when you put sperm in the sperm bank. Like, you like, deposit it and you're earning like, interest somehow. I don't know how, but you're earning. Interest will tell you it's not sustainable, obviously.
00:54:42.651 - 00:54:44.935, Speaker B: But I mean, it's an Arab bar.
00:54:46.355 - 00:54:48.035, Speaker A: This is probably actually Norris Barrels.
00:54:48.075 - 00:54:57.815, Speaker C: Yeah, you're getting distributions from everyone else's firm who doesn't get accepted, Right? Like, you're now collecting all of the other donors.
00:54:58.555 - 00:55:00.251, Speaker A: Oh, you're like, you're like, just mogging.
00:55:00.323 - 00:55:03.739, Speaker C: Fractionalized asset quantities, right?
00:55:03.827 - 00:55:07.295, Speaker B: He's got a points leaderboard Whoever's getting requested the most.
00:55:08.835 - 00:56:00.049, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean you could have a basic bonding curve model too, right? You could have something where like people deliver sperm into the sperm bank through these like you know, companies. And then, and then when there's a buyer for it, like you essentially found the buyer, you then give the guy who bonded sperm in tokens and then the dao basically earns that money that was sold to the woman. And then you know, the tokens govern that dao. So essentially it's like this dao governed by the sperm that was chosen. You could have that kind of a simple model. So you know, the cool thing you can have with that is that you could also then have people who like stake eth or like stake sol. And then when they stake that they also earn points that gives them this like, let's call it like a life token.
00:56:00.049 - 00:56:30.195, Speaker A: And then so they're also earning and then the yield is used to pay child support for the women who buy the sperm. So then you have a model where she's buying the sperm but then she's getting child support from this DAO for 18 years. So you know, and so she's getting some kind of like father style service from this dao, like some, some post birth care and then. Yeah, exactly. Decentralized father. The all. The all father, as we say in Mongolia.
00:56:30.195 - 00:57:09.593, Speaker A: The all father. Yeah, like that, that could be huge, right? Because then you have solved like the child support. Like, like you already get the government support because the government will give you in the future like hundreds of thousands of dollars for having that child. Then you have the all father DAO giving you child support from having bought the sperm. And then everyone's going to bomb their sperm hoping that their sperm gets chosen like from this dao. Like from this decentralized sperm bank. Like that will be pretty epic where in the future almost every woman who freezes eggs, she'll also buy sperm to create embryos.
00:57:09.593 - 00:57:43.225, Speaker A: And you know, every time that happens, you know, whether the child gets made or not, like the, like whether the embryo gets implanted, you know, you, the sperm has already been sold. So essentially those tokens are already be earned by the sperm donor. So you know, it's, it's something where you know, by, by donating early you can be. And also you know, by being part of it, you can earn a percentage of the network of this all father dow. So it's percentage. It's probably. Yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:57:43.225 - 00:57:45.513, Speaker A: So there's a lot of.
00:57:45.529 - 00:57:54.561, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a lot of really funny financial models. I Do. I do think though that the physical, there's a bit of a physical question here too.
00:57:54.593 - 00:57:54.785, Speaker D: Right.
00:57:54.825 - 00:58:05.735, Speaker C: Because you can't get a bunch of like lubricants into the sperm sample itself when you're donating. So the stuff has to be donated dry.
00:58:06.435 - 00:58:06.963, Speaker D: Right.
00:58:07.059 - 00:58:39.729, Speaker C: Which, you know, I, again, like, I don't know how to say this without getting into the territory of vulgarity, but I think most men are used to there being some form of lubrication during their, their donation. And you know, I think, I think this could be, now that I'm thinking about it, the thing that like bans circumcision or. Right. Like this might be the thing in the west that like, it's like, oh yeah, it's going to be really inconvenient for you to produce donor sperm.
00:58:39.897 - 00:59:03.767, Speaker A: Have you, have you guys seen this? Have you guys seen this Chinese sperm collection machine I posted on the chat? Yeah. So it's a hands free solution to sperm collection for men who are too embarrassed to masturbate in the hospital. What this will do is it'll actually, you know, go in and out, if you will, and then, you know, it's more efficient.
00:59:03.911 - 00:59:06.715, Speaker C: You can get fucked by the wall machine.
00:59:09.615 - 00:59:18.155, Speaker A: Yes. So the wall pussy will, will collect it more efficiently. And without lubricant, you can control the speed.
00:59:19.345 - 00:59:36.257, Speaker C: They've got a, they've got a, like an actual. So it's in the wall obviously, but they had a wall of these in the sense that there's like 200 of them lined up. Like you're gonna have like, like just thousands of men in this room together standing at the, the cum wall all getting milked. Like, this is.
00:59:36.321 - 00:59:42.645, Speaker A: Oh yeah, definitely, definitely me.
00:59:43.705 - 00:59:45.895, Speaker B: That's terrifying.
00:59:49.795 - 00:59:52.187, Speaker C: Are you, did you pull the video up here? I'm.
00:59:52.371 - 00:59:53.531, Speaker A: Yeah, you put the video up.
00:59:53.603 - 01:00:02.815, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, I don't have to look at it in my own little personal browser here. That's good because I don't, I, like, I just don't want that on my web history frankly for, you know, like 10 minutes.
01:00:05.475 - 01:00:08.227, Speaker A: You're gonna start getting shown some funny ads. Yeah.
01:00:08.291 - 01:00:14.797, Speaker B: Yeah. Hell, oh my. Yeah.
01:00:14.981 - 01:00:31.509, Speaker C: Why did they make the machine shaped that way? You know, like, I, how would you shape it? I, I would make it just like as blocky as pot. Like make it look literally like, like don't even have like organic shapes on it at all.
01:00:31.597 - 01:00:33.825, Speaker A: Like an alien, like alien extraction.
01:00:34.125 - 01:00:39.395, Speaker C: Yeah, like make it like us Stainless steel, like metal rectangle that's sitting there.
01:00:40.415 - 01:00:42.835, Speaker B: Like the gong Jabbar from June.
01:00:47.335 - 01:00:56.075, Speaker C: You want to use like 50% of the power draw to have like an internal refrigeration circuit so that when you touch it, it's just unnatural and alien.
01:00:57.535 - 01:00:59.967, Speaker A: Sounds like. Sounds like your fantasy, Lucas. It sounds like.
01:01:00.031 - 01:01:00.869, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
01:01:01.007 - 01:01:08.845, Speaker C: You want the like, alien, like, entrapment, like sperm collection rectangle from the Borg.
01:01:09.425 - 01:01:23.685, Speaker B: I did. I did hear of a team building, like male sex. Sex aids in crypto. I can't remember the name. I don't think they've actually came out with stealth yet. But I'll send it over and find it after this.
01:01:24.505 - 01:01:28.387, Speaker A: What are they building? They're building male like, section collection.
01:01:28.571 - 01:01:35.135, Speaker B: I think it's. I think it's a sperm collection or. I don't know if it's just recreational, but I'll. I'll ask the guy I know who's. Who's building it.
01:01:36.035 - 01:01:37.735, Speaker A: You mean like a flashlight?
01:01:39.635 - 01:01:50.243, Speaker B: I'll have to get the full details of it, but it's. It's definitely in that realm. Like, like Puff Paul Puffball did vape to earn. And this like, this device is just like taking it to the next level of extreme.
01:01:50.299 - 01:02:01.121, Speaker A: So I mean, I wonder if you just buy a bunch of these bad boys and put them in cities like world Coin style and be like, come during. When you give them. When you give them the.
01:02:01.153 - 01:02:01.561, Speaker B: Aw.
01:02:01.673 - 01:02:02.209, Speaker C: Women.
01:02:02.337 - 01:02:05.297, Speaker A: You'll get banned everywhere, I think be abandoned immediately.
01:02:05.481 - 01:02:40.255, Speaker C: Women have had their, like, weird, like vibrator legalized in terms of like the social. The social consequences for a long time, right? Like, you know, like basically every girl, some at this point has like a Hitachi vibe or something like that. Or like some like, you know, like the Giga super, super powerful like 18 million RPM turbo vibe. And that's just normal. Or they'll have like a collection of them or something like that. Like, if you go over and you're hanging out with them, it's not even at the point where like, you're allowed to say anything. When they have like an entire second walk in closet filled with like.
01:02:40.635 - 01:02:53.415, Speaker A: I'm speaking of that. Speaking of that. I'm sure you've seen this. But it's like when the. When the. When the Bali immigration destroyed all the sex doll other. The sex toys that they confiscated from tourists because you can't bring them in.
01:02:53.575 - 01:02:57.263, Speaker B: It's hilarious. Honestly, it's just like.
01:02:57.319 - 01:03:06.835, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's been largely like, not a thing for guys. But like, if you have these weird, like, sperm donation outlets. Oh God, this is funny.
01:03:08.655 - 01:03:16.115, Speaker A: So they like destroyed all these in one huge press conference. Total value, like to 200k.
01:03:18.055 - 01:03:21.315, Speaker B: From January to July. Me, big market.
01:03:22.335 - 01:03:32.475, Speaker C: Did they do a breakdown of, like. Like the male versus female sex toys or, like, what was the value? Like, are men versus women willing to spend more on, like, masturbating?
01:03:35.855 - 01:03:40.655, Speaker A: I mean, I have to. I have to believe it's like all. All dodos now. Like vibrators.
01:03:40.735 - 01:03:45.423, Speaker B: It's gotta be. Gotta be. All right.
01:03:45.519 - 01:04:02.755, Speaker C: Imagine going to Bali too, where it's like the place that's known for being like a young chief, like, hookup location as a guy. And you bring like, your like, fake silicon ass, right? Use up like 50 of your suitcase on this. Like.
01:04:07.815 - 01:04:09.915, Speaker B: Take it. Take it in your hand luggage.
01:04:10.555 - 01:04:20.295, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, this is the guy who's the most dedicated to, like, he's the hustle grind set king, dude. Like, he hasn't thought about real sex once in the last three years.
01:04:22.755 - 01:04:34.975, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard they were selling. What was it like? There was this, like, ceremony in ubud which were resetting women's body count not too long ago.
01:04:35.875 - 01:04:40.055, Speaker A: Well, I saw that as well. Yeah. I wonder if it works.
01:04:41.845 - 01:04:44.425, Speaker B: Yeah. Placebo effect and all that.
01:04:45.965 - 01:04:47.413, Speaker C: Me, I should start doing.
01:04:47.469 - 01:04:50.653, Speaker A: That's actually also a great idea. Yeah. That's actually great business.
01:04:50.749 - 01:05:01.069, Speaker C: We absolutely have. Like, I will. I will formally, like, via the council of incels, I will wind your body count back to zero. Right.
01:05:01.237 - 01:05:18.713, Speaker A: It's like when the Catholic church sells indulgences. Yeah. You know how they sell indulgences, like pre Protestant reformation, that you're gonna go to heaven if you pay, if you buy the indulgences. Lucas is in Lucas's reset of body count. He will check your hymen again. He will zip it back up for you. He will.
01:05:18.713 - 01:05:22.965, Speaker A: But he will bless it with the. Exactly.
01:05:26.265 - 01:05:27.057, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:27.241 - 01:05:42.467, Speaker C: Well, I was talking to a girl recently, actually, who did. She came from a culture with. This is the norm. I'm. I'm not going to say which, but like, there are still people out there where they're doing like, hyman inspections and the me who does them is their dad.
01:05:42.651 - 01:05:43.867, Speaker B: Oh, no.
01:05:43.971 - 01:05:46.815, Speaker C: Just like, dude, what?
01:05:51.115 - 01:06:05.075, Speaker B: Hell, that's a bit rough. All right, so changing the world with spam fi. Centralized sperm banks coming to a offshore island near you by the looks of it.
01:06:10.695 - 01:06:21.375, Speaker C: Just sounds that much like, do you want the. The onshore sperm? Because it seems like you're gonna get some local stuff. It's just a worse selection. But the global sperm from everyone.
01:06:21.455 - 01:06:21.671, Speaker D: Right.
01:06:21.703 - 01:06:28.485, Speaker C: Like, this is the best of the best. The cream of the crop. So good it may be illegal even. Right.
01:06:32.865 - 01:06:47.969, Speaker B: Do you think. Do you Think there, there really is like the, the potential for like, I don't know, specific traits, like the like unvac sperm. And I can't even think of like another one off the top of my head, to be honest.
01:06:48.017 - 01:06:50.695, Speaker A: Like, I don't know if women will expert.
01:06:52.355 - 01:07:10.415, Speaker B: What about someone who's like mega, like mega, mega, mega rich. Do you think people are going to be queuing up for that and like paying for it? Because, like, where's the incentive for the person who's actually selling it? Or do you think it's just more of like a I want to go forth and spread the seed kind of deal with. You've kind of conquered life.
01:07:11.155 - 01:07:42.877, Speaker A: I mean, if you're like an Olympic athlete in like the US you actually can't make that much money. Like, how are you going to make any money, right? It's not that easy. But then, you know, your sperm might go for tens of thousands of dollars in the sperm market. Like, I think that what you'll see, like, you know how people make fun of women for having like, like delusional ideas, like the probability of traits occurring. So they're like, you know, a guy who's 65 and like makes certain amount and blue eyes is like impossible. The person doesn't exist. But like, actually with sperm markets, with elite sperm markets, that person does exist.
01:07:42.877 - 01:07:47.117, Speaker A: You can just find them and then you can buy their sperm. And so it's like kind of a.
01:07:47.261 - 01:07:58.989, Speaker C: Interesting isn't something that will ever be selected for, right? Like, why that if I'm a girl, why do I give a shit about the Olympic athlete if he's like, also sort of an idiot and like wound up being like a burnout later in life, right?
01:07:59.117 - 01:08:11.913, Speaker A: That's just because the US they don't like the Olympics anymore. Like, Olympics is passe, but like in China, like, they're all about Olympics, so it's like they'll buy it. Like the Asian market will buy the Olympic gene. They'll be like, wow, he's a gymnast. I'm gonna buy his jeans.
01:08:12.009 - 01:08:17.605, Speaker C: So they would buy his permission?
01:08:18.385 - 01:08:39.323, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. They would do both. They'll do both. But they would want like, like the cache of having like, Olympics would be higher, like absolute, like, you know, quality in that sense. I mean, there's just more opportunities if you're Olympic athlete. Think about Eileen Gu, right? Like, she won the gold medal in skiing and then she can do all these sponsorships. You can do all this stuff.
01:08:39.323 - 01:08:56.651, Speaker A: You know, it's, it's, it's a big, it's a Big, like, easy way to convert genetics into, like, power or money. Right. Whereas, you know, you do other trades. It's like more. It's more speculative. But I mean, I think each country, each type of person, they'll buy based on different things. Right.
01:08:56.651 - 01:09:05.477, Speaker A: Like, some. Some people might buy, you know, based on, like, a totally different set of, you know, parameters. Yeah.
01:09:05.501 - 01:09:29.031, Speaker C: This was my assumption early on was I assumed that the. The girls in the west who would try this would be. They would care about, like, how attractive facially that the guy is going to be. And I think in the east, that would be much less of a consideration. Like, the girls in the west might even want, like, some sort of, like, a celebrity who's like, he's 40, right? Like, he's washed his. His sperm, his. Hit like four walls by now.
01:09:29.031 - 01:09:36.903, Speaker C: Like, it's. It's limping along, like, going to make the most autistic babies in the universe. But, like, they would still want it just because they have, like, a celebrity.
01:09:36.959 - 01:09:37.247, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:37.311 - 01:09:37.903, Speaker C: On the guy.
01:09:37.959 - 01:09:38.199, Speaker D: Right.
01:09:38.247 - 01:09:38.967, Speaker C: Whereas.
01:09:39.151 - 01:09:42.755, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a weird one. Like, like, cameo, but for sperm.
01:09:43.255 - 01:10:24.921, Speaker A: Yeah, you could do that too. Because, like, if you think about, like, the adding of audio clips, like, I think a lot of women, they want to hear what he sounds like because they want to be like, okay, you know, the kind of. It's like a parasocial relationship with the guy. Like, I think you're going to see this in general, and that's why I'm pretty bullish on the idea of, you know, if you do these kind of global searches and you almost do like a decathlon, you know, you could get guys who won't, like, say, like, they win the decathlon. Like, it's like almost like a chess boxing, right? Like, you have, like, your psychometrics, you have your athletics, you have something else. And at the end you, like, oh, you're like, you won. You get to donate your sperm to this thing.
01:10:24.921 - 01:11:03.187, Speaker A: Like, then we can sell it, right? So. So that. So that is, like, really interesting because, like, you could get a lot of guys who wouldn't normally donate sperm because, like, you, like, why would I do that? To be more like, you know, it's like a celebration of, like, skill of, like, kind of a, like, combo traits. And I think that you're gonna get, like, at least in East Asian societies like, that. That wouldn't have the same stigma as, like. I mean, this would be like, very high stigma in, like, Brooklyn or something. Right? But I think in most of East Asia it would be like, of course, this makes a lot of sense.
01:11:03.187 - 01:11:03.935, Speaker A: So.
01:11:04.395 - 01:11:40.073, Speaker C: Oh, here we got another horror story type thing that's gonna come from this. You're talking about the voice samples, right? So what if you get like a 30 minute recording of the guy talking, right? And you can make like an infinite amount of like 11 labs AI voice samples from. You can now sell the woman an AI with like a real voice of her father, right? Like there's, there's an imaginary AI husband being produced for this male sperm donor that she's like inseminating herself with. That could like raise the kids.
01:11:40.209 - 01:11:40.841, Speaker B: Oh.
01:11:40.993 - 01:11:53.365, Speaker C: Like the company themselves could like put, you could put like advertisements in this husband in the AI husband that you sell to this wife. And he could be advertising to their kids.
01:11:55.185 - 01:11:56.965, Speaker B: All right, you gotta wrap up, Suya.
01:11:57.585 - 01:12:04.255, Speaker A: Yeah, but you guys can keep going if you want, I mean, and just record more. It's all good. All right, sweet.
01:12:05.155 - 01:12:23.019, Speaker B: I've got another meeting in a second anyway. I'm a little bit over, but. All right, gents, thanks so much and. All right, take it easy.
01:12:23.147 - 01:12:24.291, Speaker A: All right, bye.
