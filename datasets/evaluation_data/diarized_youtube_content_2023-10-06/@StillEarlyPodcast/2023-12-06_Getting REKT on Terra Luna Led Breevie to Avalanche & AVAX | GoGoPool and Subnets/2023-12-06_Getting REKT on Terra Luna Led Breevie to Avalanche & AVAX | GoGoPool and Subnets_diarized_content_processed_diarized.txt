00:00:00.520 - 00:00:42.467, Speaker A: You know, we're in a good place as far as like how early we are in this. As far as like financially speaking, we are very, very early. But and also being very early, very long term mindset with everything even, I mean, just beyond even the financials, like the technology in and of itself is going to be an absolute game changer. It's going to change the way that we just kind of live life. Like we're already kind of, we're already kind of seeing it now and I just can't wait for like it to be, let's say two years from now and there's like 5, 6, 700 subnets that are out there. And then like that avalanche thesis has been proved. I can't wait.
00:00:42.571 - 00:01:11.385, Speaker B: Jm so just a quick one before we get started. So still early is podcast for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Any investment decision you should make should be based on your own research and your own understanding of the risks involved. So yeah, that's it for me. Let's get on with the show. I've recorded five podcasts in the last 24 hours, so I'm a little bit delirious. So I don't actually know what number this is going to be.
00:01:11.385 - 00:01:37.335, Speaker B: So we've got Brie. Some of you might know him if you've been joining the Avax ecosystem spaces or, or you might know him from Google Pool or you might know him from anything but Web3 podcast. Like this guy is busier than me and that's something. And we're supposed to have tulips here, but God knows where he is. That guy is hectic at the best of times, so he might join us at some point. But dude, how's it going? Thanks for jumping on.
00:01:37.755 - 00:01:41.211, Speaker A: Ah, dude, no problem at all. And thanks. Thank you for having me on.
00:01:41.363 - 00:02:11.958, Speaker B: No, anytime, anytime. Like we were doing kind of like a, a scoop of who's got their ears to the ground and the avalanche ecosystem. And obviously Dan was pulling up a lot of research and you guys have, you know, doing what you're doing in the space. So it was like, yeah, let's do it. And like, selfishly, as I said to you before coming on, a lot of them have been, particularly on still early, have been a little bit more protocol focused. So now I just like get to relax for 45 minutes to an hour and just shoot some shit about the ecosystem. So thanks for giving me that kind of release, dude.
00:02:12.046 - 00:02:29.754, Speaker A: No problem at all. Thank you for giving me that release, dude. We're in a similar space. So I completely understand where I live. Dude, crypto is not a big thing at all in Chicago. Not huge. So it's hard actually getting people to actually want to talk about it.
00:02:29.754 - 00:02:31.914, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:02:32.334 - 00:02:54.385, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. It's a funny one. I suppose Chicago is quite a funny one because, like, you've got CBOE there and, like, you got like a big, like, traditional finance kind of melting melting pot, really. So you'd kind of expect a little bit more to come out of there, but maybe it's just so kind of indoctrinated with the incumbents that doesn't really flourish as much as it should.
00:02:54.765 - 00:03:30.881, Speaker A: Nah, it's. It's definitely not flourishing over here, my friend. My friends usually. I mean, granted, we've been in a major bear market for the last, like, however fucking long, so, like, you know, it kind of makes sense. The sentiment is really, really bad. Like, at the most, you know, most of the time, like, people are asking me, like, what do you do? And I'm like, oh, you know, like, I head up marketing for a crypto company. And they're just like, all right, we're going to fucking stop this conversation, you know?
00:03:30.953 - 00:03:50.225, Speaker B: You know, it was funny. I was at. We were in Singapore for token 2049, and, like, the down to the downstairs area was like, NFT focused. And they even had this, like, NFT gallery and these two guys walking in. They were quite, like, suited and booted. I was like, these guys look a little bit out of place here. And they were just.
00:03:50.225 - 00:03:58.405, Speaker B: They were walking like one, like one person in front of me. And one of them went, oh, that's like an NFT gallery. He went, oh, NFTs, that's cool. Are they still a thing?
00:04:02.245 - 00:04:16.745, Speaker A: Are they still a thing? Oh, dude, that is great. Actually, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the NFT landscape in Avalanche. Actually.
00:04:17.405 - 00:04:49.405, Speaker B: Yeah, well, we had Brando on like two weeks ago, and like, I left that conversation from Brando from Tokyo. And I left that conversation. I was like, yeah, I feel comfortable betting on these guys to do well. And this is kind of avalanche, like $1718 or some. And then, like, the floor was maybe 1718, and they just kind of been up only ever since. But I think it's like. I think people are sick and tired.
00:04:49.405 - 00:05:48.611, Speaker B: And it got extremely saturated by an NFT project launching with very optimistic roadmap, to put it kind of politely, and just stuff as soon as, like, the mint comes through. And, like, people just, you know, sack it often. Slow, slow rug it. But, like, I think what, what's interesting is at that same conference we interviewed Luca from Pudgy Penguins and I think they've set the standard now. I think anything like sub what Pudgy Penguins have done and kind of got into Walmart and got into Smiths and like the amount of like consumers that they're getting into the hands of and just kind of building this like IP brand identity around Pudgy Penguins, I think that is like the bar and I think anything below that is. It's just not worth people's time, money and effort, I think. So I think it's going to, it's going to create a new breed because that's a whole different ballgame and like what Doki are doing with like wanting to disrupt like boring businesses like noodles and stuff like that.
00:05:48.611 - 00:06:07.585, Speaker B: And they've obviously got the creative studio. I think those are the kind of people people should be paying attention to, not just people that are coming online. And this is a mint. This is a roadmap when like, it just doesn't make sense. I think it got very, very frothy towards the end. But yeah, the, the standard has been set higher by Luca and Pudgy Penguins, I think. What do you think?
00:06:08.885 - 00:06:56.041, Speaker A: So for one thing, yeah, Pudgy Penguins and what should we call Yuga are absolutely crushing it. Like to the point to where I've seen NFT projects say that like, literally like, oh, we're doing something similar to Yuga. But then of course they obviously don't do anything like remotely close. And it's exactly as you said, like it's dope to see NFT projects kind of expand out their branding. Like, like with Board Ape Yacht Club working very, like, working pretty closely with like Eminem and Snoop Dogg and they were a part of the. Was that the Grammys? It was either the Grammys or the Oscars where Eminem and Snoop Dogg had a performance and they were actually using their Board Apes in the performance. And that's the only, that's the only, that's.
00:06:56.041 - 00:07:31.055, Speaker A: Those are things that you only get when you have like a, like a very, very clear vision for your project and you're actually like doing the right things when it comes to branding on the, on the, on the dokyo side of things. Like, I love the artwork. When they came out, their marketing was just like a one dude. Just when they came out with the one teaser video and I, I just remember being like, what is this? You know, like, I didn't know if it was NFTs. I didn't know Actually anything about the project. But I. I knew in my mind I was asking myself, what is this? And I was really, really interested in what it was.
00:07:31.055 - 00:07:33.535, Speaker A: Very sad. I think that's.
00:07:34.155 - 00:07:35.135, Speaker B: You didn't.
00:07:35.595 - 00:07:44.015, Speaker A: I did not. I didn't. It was. It was too overhyped. Yeah. It was too hyped, dude. So I was like, nah, I don't know.
00:07:44.785 - 00:07:57.601, Speaker B: That's. That what they did with that video. And like, that was like the less is more. And. And you know, everyone can. You can go either like one way or the other with it. You can be like really minimalist with it.
00:07:57.601 - 00:08:34.275, Speaker B: And I think that that kind of reasserts what they're trying to do with that brand and vision and stuff like that. Or you could just be like, really over the top, everyone's talking about, or you've allocated to like X amount of kols or influences in the space that are going to just like ram it down people's throats. But I think that's a lot of a classier way to do it, to be honest. I think it's a little bit more artistic and I think it's a bit. A lot cooler anyway, just to kind of be like, here's the video. Let people speculate because the speculative industry. So it's like, is it going to be a game? Is it going to be just like NFT project? Like, what actually is it going to be? So I think it was like a really, really cool way to do it and it could have backfired because it's just like.
00:08:34.275 - 00:08:38.545, Speaker B: And what. But everyone got it and it was like, yeah, this is going to be. This is going to be cool.
00:08:39.285 - 00:08:58.325, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's. It was like a masterclass. And in marketing, especially in that specific, like you said, that minimalistic way. I remember going onto their profile that I think the only tweet on the profile might have been just the video. And then like, people, I mean, it was. It was such a. It was such a masterpiece of art.
00:08:58.325 - 00:09:18.135, Speaker A: Like, the video was that you really did have to share it and you did have to wonder, like, what is this? Is this a game? Is this. I'm like, it's almost like some final fantasy. I don't know what's going on. Like. Like this could be anything. It could be RPG if they wanted it to be. So, yeah, I definitely thought that they did a great, great job with the marketing.
00:09:18.955 - 00:09:23.695, Speaker B: Are you. Are you primarily in the market inside of like, Google school or.
00:09:24.195 - 00:09:44.895, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So marketing and content creation and a little bit of. A little bit of bd. I wouldn't say it's like my main kind of foray, but mainly, yeah, on the marketing side, you'll see me. I mean, you named a few things earlier. I got Avax ecosystem space that I host Wednesdays 3pm EST.
00:09:44.895 - 00:09:54.315, Speaker A: That wasn't a show, but it was a show. And then I got anything but web 3 that I also host every Friday at 12pm USD. Further shilling.
00:09:55.655 - 00:09:57.755, Speaker B: Best show name in the industry.
00:09:58.795 - 00:10:24.059, Speaker A: Thank you. So it's actually funny that you said that because I had one episode with John from Dex a lot where I like changed up the name just because I call it anything but Web three. Because we're supposed to talk about everything but Web three. But it's literally like every. I got these Web three people coming on and I'm Web three focused as well. So typically the conversation like still, somehow.
00:10:24.187 - 00:10:26.815, Speaker B: It just naturally converges to it.
00:10:28.515 - 00:10:35.267, Speaker A: But dude. Yeah, I love it though, man. Like, like what you're doing, like your setup is clean as. I know I said this earlier, but.
00:10:35.291 - 00:10:59.331, Speaker B: I just gotta say it, man. The. So I was running off like this really shit. I can't remember what mic it was. And this really shit webcam. And then I, as I say, I said to you before we went on, I really went down the YouTube rabbit hole of like home podcasting equipment. So that this mic, I think it's like the Shua SM7B.
00:10:59.331 - 00:11:21.413, Speaker B: I like looked at the price, but everyone was just telling me to buy it and I was like, fuck sake. I was like, 600 for a mic. I was like, I know I do this a lot, but it's a lot. But then as soon as like I recorded, I had to do like a, like a disclaimer voiceover for the podcast and like listen to it back. Even though I hate listening to my voice, I was like, it sounds so crisp. It's like so worth the money. And then it's just like lighting.
00:11:21.413 - 00:11:44.105, Speaker B: Like lighting is like absolutely everything. And like I know people bang on about it, but if you're struggling to get a good kind of image, just get a good soft light. And that's the cheapest thing you're going to buy as well. Like $20 or something. And just makes like the full setup look way, way better. And this is just running from the MacBook Pro, the new one for the, for the camera. But so it's not like a expensive setup by any means, but it looks all right.
00:11:44.645 - 00:11:57.215, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely a really, really good quality mic. Dude, as soon as you start talking, I was like oh yeah, he's got a fucking fire ass mic. I'm just using like the mic from the laptop like anything but Web3 is, is so just like.
00:11:59.355 - 00:12:12.163, Speaker B: That'S. Yeah, I mean we run like still early once a week and then like Block meds podcast can be as I said I did four yesterday, so it was.
00:12:12.299 - 00:12:12.975, Speaker A: Oh.
00:12:13.755 - 00:12:27.013, Speaker B: So I was just like, let's just bite the bullet, get a good setup and hopefully like don't have to buy twice, you know. So I don't know, there might be even a new podcast in the new year as well. We'll have to see.
00:12:27.149 - 00:12:30.105, Speaker A: Yeah, see a little alpha. Throw that out there.
00:12:30.485 - 00:12:37.025, Speaker B: I really can't. I don't want to host it. I don't mind producing it but I'm sick of my own voice at the minute and I'm pretty sure everyone else is.
00:12:39.365 - 00:12:42.555, Speaker A: So who else have you interviewed so far?
00:12:43.615 - 00:13:13.065, Speaker B: So I had dominic heads of NFTs and like arts. He had Brando from Tokyo, had Luigi. We had Fish from Trader Joe. Who else? We had Coupe for getting into some of the gaming stuff. Got had Jack on yesterday from AAN and yeah, Emin might be coming on in a week or two. So.
00:13:16.765 - 00:13:20.213, Speaker A: Yeah bro, I was looking at.
00:13:20.229 - 00:13:29.253, Speaker B: The calendar and it was like 1:00 in the morning is the only slot like my time and I was like, oh fuck sick, I'm gonna have to do it. I'm just gonna have to, just gonna have to stay up late and do.
00:13:29.269 - 00:14:00.545, Speaker A: It, do it bro. Like I, when I. So I used to have a podcast on Terra Luna and I was doing it while I was, this is before I was full time web3. So I was like, I was also like a liquor distributor salesman as well. So I would get off like five rush hour traffic back home, get home like 6:30, eat some food real quick. Now it's like 7:30. And then like I would just be doing podcasting, dude, as soon as I like had some, had some time.
00:14:00.545 - 00:14:10.415, Speaker A: So I've been there where people like can't book during the time you want and they're just like yeah, I gotta do it at like three in the morning. Like you're just like.
00:14:15.155 - 00:14:23.295, Speaker B: What was that whole fiasco? Like obviously you're quite close to it. If it collapsed, like what was it? Just chaos.
00:14:24.515 - 00:14:52.565, Speaker A: If. Yeah, for me it was dude. So, so I, I started my podcast maybe like two, it was like two, three years ago. And this is like basically when I first started in Crypto almost. I could say like when I first really could say I understood the Technology. I'm actually researching the projects. It's not just like a get rich quick scheme to me anymore.
00:14:52.565 - 00:15:30.285, Speaker A: And so I decided to start bringing on projects just so I can kind of just talk to them and, you know, just see what they're building and stuff. And did that, interviewed somewhere around, like, 40 projects. And so I did that for, like, I don't know, like eight months, almost a year, something like that. And then eventually started. There were a lot of content creators on Terra Luna, which is something we're missing in avalanche. I will say that we are definitely missing content creators in avalanche for sure. Just because, you know, what I saw in Terra Luna was just.
00:15:30.285 - 00:15:55.481, Speaker A: It was just such a massive ecosystem of, like, news. There's, like, terror news. There was people doing tutorial videos. There were people, like, doing Twitter spaces where they would just talk about different strategies that would be happening in the ecosystem. Well, different defi strategies, I should say. But so we had all these different content creators in Terra Luna. And so one day we all kind of got together.
00:15:55.481 - 00:16:26.725, Speaker A: It's maybe like 15, 20 of us, and we were forming a Terra Luna creator Dao. And so we had already started a whole YouTube channel with each other where we were putting out videos. We probably had like six different segments. So we had like, my podcast, we had another person's podcast. We had somebody did podcasting on just like the governed proposals. Mine was more like general kind of. Well, I had two.
00:16:26.725 - 00:16:49.455, Speaker A: I had one that was more like talking to the projects, and then I had one that was more similar to, like, what you're doing, where it's just kind of. We're just chopping it up, really, about what's going on in the ecosystem. And so we're meeting about this, trying to figure out, you know, like, how. How we should go. We have a meeting on a Monday. I have Covid during that meeting. So, like, I'm just like.
00:16:49.455 - 00:17:23.634, Speaker A: So I hit up one of your. Yeah, this is during the COVID Wave, everybody. This is right before the collapse. And so, like, I'm just sitting out and I told my. I had a co host who I was hosting most of my podcast with. I just said, hey, man, you know, can you just let me know what happens at the meeting? And then, so I'm laying in bed, man, you know, the meeting has to have passed. So I hit him with the message, like, hey, you know, how'd the meeting go? And he was like, well, the meeting went really well, but I think it's all over.
00:17:23.634 - 00:17:46.405, Speaker A: And I was. And I was like, what do you mean like, it's all over, Nobody wants to do the DAO anymore? And he was like, nah, dude. He's like, nah, dude, Terra Luna. I was like, what do you mean, bro? And he was like, go check ust right now. And I checked. And it's just this massive red candle.
00:17:47.425 - 00:17:48.605, Speaker B: Oh, man.
00:17:49.705 - 00:18:10.027, Speaker A: Yeah. So that's why it was funny when you asked, like, how was it? And I'm like, dude, I was so, like, financially I was heavily invested in Luna because I was a Terra Luna maxi, so it was the only thing I was invested in. So I was financially very invested. But like career wise, I was invested mentally. It was just, it literally was like my everything. And then just.
00:18:10.171 - 00:18:51.295, Speaker B: Yeah, I was gonna, I was gonna say that must be like, it's one thing like the money and then, but there's like what you spending all your kind of creative energy and time and effort on and like even the relationships that you're building around the ecosystem, it's. I don't know if that, that kind of gets taken out, if that kind of gets taken away, that's just, just as big of the hit, like kind of make the money back. You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, never going to get that time and effort and money spent back. But what was the. So you primarily spend your, your time in the Avalanche ecosystem? And what was. Is it just. Was that just like a natural, natural fit post that or have you always kind of been in and around it or.
00:18:51.635 - 00:19:40.091, Speaker A: Oh, dude, I didn't know about Avalanche. Really. Like, I mean, I knew Avalanche existed, but I didn't know anything about it prior to the Terra Luna collapse. What, what happened was after the collapse, let's say like a few months after that, one of my buddies, he shoots me a message saying, hey, this company is looking for podcasters. Are you still podcasting? And you know, I looked into them and I was like, oh, okay. Like this seems like a really, really good opportunity. So wound up interviewing for the spot and then Stephen, that's our Coco Pool's founders, that CEO, he tells me about like the vision and kind of gives me just kind of a primer on Avalanche, like what it is that they're building.
00:19:40.091 - 00:20:37.615, Speaker A: And then from there he's like, okay, well here's some like, kind of resources for you to check out. And I check them out and I'm just like completely blown away by Avalanche. And then once I got hired onto the team, now I'm a content creator for the team, so I had people doing like market research for me and Then they'd give that to me, I'd turn it into a script and then I'd make a video about whatever project. But in doing that, I started learning a lot more about subnets and specifically about how they're placed within the whole landscape of app chains. And months and months of just kind of continuously learning. I then started to get more and more bullish on Avalanche and then now I'm at where I'm at right now, which is I'm acting like I haven't learned at all and I'm once again another maxi, never learning.
00:20:40.435 - 00:21:17.831, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's because Ethereum L2s take a lot of people's mind share. I don't think. I think there's kind of an asymmetric opportunity where people beginning to look. Definitely. Because you're starting to see people's interest peak in the Avalanche ecosystem again. I know that for a fun fact that's happening, but I think like the whole subnets V L2S thing and Luigi had a really good segment on this on, on one of the episodes that we recorded. I just, I still think people are just sleeping on it.
00:21:17.831 - 00:21:59.455, Speaker B: But like, for me, like, I kind of like to invest in speculating off a lot as well. But that's just great opportunity for me because what you don't want to be doing is buying into like, like everyone's shilling like AI narrative now and shit up like fucking 10X. It's like, yeah, yeah, if you're hearing about that shit on Twitter, you're definitely way too late to that trade. But what I love is like finding something and going down a rabbit hole on something and be like, right, I don't think this is priced in. I'm just going to layer a couple of chips here because I can see kind of where this is going and it might take a little bit longer to catch on, but by the time everyone starts talking about it on Twitter it's just like, yeah, hopefully your thesis is being validated and number go up and everyone's happy.
00:22:00.035 - 00:22:52.751, Speaker A: See, I like hearing that because, yeah, pros and cons. A lot of times I say again, there's not enough content creators talking about Avalanche. But that does kind of give us this situation where we're in like a, you know, we're, we're in a good place as far as like how early we are in this. As far as like financially speaking, we are very, very early. But, and also being very early, very long term mindset with everything even, I mean just beyond even the financials, like the technology in and of itself is going to be an absolute game changer. It's going to change the way that we just kind of live life. Like we're already kind of, already kind of seeing it now and I just can't wait for, for like it to be, let's say two years from now and there's like 5, 6, 700 subnets that are out there.
00:22:52.751 - 00:22:56.543, Speaker A: And then like that Avalanche thesis has been proved. It's. I can't wait.
00:22:56.719 - 00:23:41.295, Speaker B: Yeah, like you're getting like complete like both ends of the spectrum. So you've got JP Morgan and Onyx and then City, which is like obviously heavily institutional, but then you've also got like tsm, TSM and like Blitz up and it's just like, like the full spectrum of like kind of what is possible on the subnet is quite like so impressive. Yeah. And then when as you say, as you go down the rabbit hole and you're like, right, yeah, this, I can definitely see this coming true. And then that announcement last week of J.P. morgan and City and it's just like, and you can see it in the chart. Everyone's just like, oh, oh yeah, that was a, that was true all along.
00:23:41.295 - 00:23:48.795, Speaker B: But it's like, but if you just actually look like this is like one of the whole reasons behind this podcast is look where other people aren't looking.
00:23:48.955 - 00:23:49.315, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:49.355 - 00:23:57.043, Speaker B: And there's like, there's abundance of opportunity. But yeah, that JP Morgan one was like huge. And City like the day after, absolutely crazy.
00:23:57.219 - 00:24:03.095, Speaker A: Now, you know, I haven't researched too much into the JP Morgan one. What's, what's going on with that specifically?
00:24:03.735 - 00:24:44.931, Speaker B: So basically JP Morgan have got a fund that they're going to put on an Avalanche subnet and I think it reduces like, I think the tagline and this might be a little bit of marketing manipulation, but like it gets the point across. So I think there's like 3,000 steps reduced to one because of how simple it is to actually deploy or buy or purchase or transfer on the subnet. And then they can also connect into like adjacent funds through layer zero. So it's like layer zero Avalanche. I think even Axel I was on there as well. But the b. I think why it makes sense like from a tech perspective not to get too bogged down in the tear.
00:24:44.931 - 00:25:22.705, Speaker B: Like the finality on Avalanche lends itself so well to layer zero. Like if, if there was any like projects that are going to heavily rely on like a seamless layer zero experience by being completely cross gen and composable and obviously if that's kind of what they're relying on, I think it makes sense to actually be building the core infrastructure of the product on Avalanche. That makes a lot of sense to me. But yeah, it was just like came out kind of nowhere really. And it was just like they're going to build a fund, put it on Avalanche Subnet, and any interconnected or adjacent funds that need to interact with it is going to be powered by Lazero and Axelar as well. So. Pretty big.
00:25:22.705 - 00:25:24.287, Speaker B: Pretty big.
00:25:24.421 - 00:25:35.295, Speaker A: Dude, that's so insane. And it's so funny because I don't. How long have you been like in like the Avalanche space, would you say? Were you here like the beginning of the year?
00:25:35.635 - 00:25:49.055, Speaker B: I was. Well, I've been here since before the Avalanche Ethereum Bridge opened. So prior to when Trader Joe was like 3 million market cap or some.
00:25:49.515 - 00:25:51.735, Speaker A: Oh, okay. So you've been here for a while. Okay, cool.
00:25:51.795 - 00:25:59.031, Speaker B: Right. I'll tell you what it was when Pangolin was the number one dex a while.
00:25:59.143 - 00:26:42.425, Speaker A: So you're fucking OG then. All right, so it was kind of crazy because in the beginning of this year, I think it was maybe like every other day Avalanche had like some crazy major announcement. Like it would be like Monday we announced that we have a partnership with Amazon, Tuesday, partnership with the International Chess Federation, Thursday. And it's just like, like kept going on and on and then. And this is what major. These are major partnerships, right? Like you partner with Amazon, they partner with Amazon. And I forgot what were the other hosting services they partnered with? I want to say 10 cents.
00:26:42.425 - 00:27:39.445, Speaker A: I want to say 10 cent. Yeah, but in those two partnerships that is like 60, 70% of the entire hosting market. So that was one thing that I just kind of noticed with that specific partnership is like they're locking down the hosting really, really well. And then when you kind of progress things into starting to think about subnets and about all of these different gaming studios that are coming, not just games, these aren't just one off games building on subnets. Like a lot of them are full on gaming studios using this as their kind of like playground. Like this is their first game that you're going to throw on a subnet and if everything goes well, then we're going to see a lot more games get put onto that subnet. And I think that's going to, I don't know, I think that's going to be a nice ripple effect to see across the landscape as it keeps going.
00:27:39.985 - 00:28:34.291, Speaker B: Yeah, I think like Coop said, the Coop is my like resident go to for anything gaming related, not just in like avalanche ecosystem, but like he's like just a fountain of knowledge. Yeah. And when we were recording with him he was like, yeah, like definitely keep an eye on the games. But there's definitely something to be said for the publishers and the studios as well. And I know like Beam have just recently like pivoted to well, Merit Circle, just recently pivoted to what they're doing now as a gaming studio. But all it takes is like them to create one like a killer game and they launch it on an avalanche subnet and then every single game off the back of that that wants to get funded and like took through the process with them, they're just going to use the same playbook and it's like. And everyone else around them like in all the VCs and everyone who's like a budding gaming studio is going to say, well that's the playbook, that's what we do.
00:28:34.291 - 00:28:49.627, Speaker B: And like there is a blueprint there because a lot of people like need a path well trodden to actually make something work. And I guarantee if Shrapnel takes off as well as I think it will if off the grid. Well off the grid's kind of. I think it's just a done deal. I think it's just going to be absolutely insane.
00:28:49.771 - 00:28:55.295, Speaker A: Oh my God. You saw the video with Dr. Disrespect.
00:28:56.075 - 00:29:01.747, Speaker B: Just, just next level. Just like the games we've been waiting for for so long and like it's.
00:29:01.851 - 00:29:16.291, Speaker A: It'S next level from a technological perspective and from a gameplay perspective. Like I've never seen a battle royale where it like integrates the campaign like within the battle royale like that. I just want to even see what that even looks like.
00:29:16.443 - 00:29:23.695, Speaker B: Yeah. I was saying to Dan, I was like when all this comes out, if like your productivity drops off, I'll know why. He's like.
00:29:26.565 - 00:29:30.825, Speaker A: Dude, I'm trying back into being a gaming nerd. It's not working.
00:29:32.885 - 00:29:38.265, Speaker B: We got, we got the mer. They got the ripples of a beginning of a bull market. You're gonna have no time for games.
00:29:39.365 - 00:29:50.545, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah. I gotta, I gotta like love the bear market while I have it because it's about to get very intense very soon.
00:29:51.865 - 00:30:09.485, Speaker B: Are there any other interesting use cases you're seeing? I know there's, I can't remember the subnet that's getting deployed but like there was one for ticketing which made a lot of sense I think in South Korea. I don't know. Is there anything that you guys have Seen obviously you're a little bit closer to that aspect of the industry than me.
00:30:09.985 - 00:30:28.955, Speaker A: See, the main industry I kind of pay attention to is the gaming space. I do have one that I would like to highlight and that's, that's block pay. Just because I feel like they're, they're not getting the highlight that they should necessarily get because that. How familiar are you with Black Pay actually, by the way?
00:30:29.335 - 00:30:31.079, Speaker B: I'm not, I'm not very familiar.
00:30:31.207 - 00:30:33.479, Speaker A: Oh, shit. All right, well, yeah, I got you, dude.
00:30:33.527 - 00:30:34.247, Speaker B: Fill me in.
00:30:34.351 - 00:31:17.759, Speaker A: I got you, man. So we're actually building their subnet right now. So the main net should be in like Q1. Really excited about them specifically because they're doing like payment infrastructure. So they are a Latin American based company and they have POS terminals at, I think it's like 1100 different businesses already that all can, you know, obviously accept credit cards, debit cards, but they also have a physical debit card to where you can actually spend your, your crypto, you can spend your avalanche. And it's all. I mean, obviously once we built their subnet, it'll all get powered on an avalanche subnet.
00:31:17.759 - 00:31:44.887, Speaker A: And like, that's, that's something like I can't wait for because one of the things that they're also planning on doing is doing like a digital card as well. And once we have the digital card here, then it'll just make things like, it'll be super easy and kind of seamless for people to start spending their avalanche gains, you know, because right now they're just, you know, kind of just locked. Unless you want to take them out, you know, go. But you got to send them over to. It's a lot of different.
00:31:44.991 - 00:32:13.887, Speaker B: It's too annoying if like I keep basically everything I have, like in my own custody. Like, and people think that's a little bit crazy and a bit mental. But if there was just like. And some like. The interesting thing about cards is you'll find a good one that works and then like it'll just be taken down for some whatever reason or they discontinue it and like, likes a block pair. I think holy hell is a pretty good one as well. You can kind of directly load it from your metamask.
00:32:13.887 - 00:32:21.675, Speaker B: So that's a pretty good one. But we just need, need more of them. Yeah, like, give me them all because I'll use them every single day.
00:32:22.335 - 00:32:37.925, Speaker A: We need more like on ramps because I don't know, like right now, right now the only one that I use right now is Coinbase. Like if you, if you know of any other ones, please make me privy to them. But that's all I got.
00:32:38.425 - 00:33:01.205, Speaker B: Well, I think a lot of people in the UK were using Kraken and then obviously I. Big GGs went after them again today. So it doesn't look, doesn't look great for Kraken at the minute. But yeah, we need a little bit more like on and off. I don't even know how you solve that problem. Like on and off. Rams director.
00:33:01.205 - 00:33:17.685, Speaker B: Yeah, self custody wallets. It's. That's like such a big opportunity but I think it's a bit of a minefield to be honest. But yeah, like the offer, I'm kind of the easy bit. Easy bit if you want to just kind of spend it. But yeah, a lot of. I use Coinbase, I'll use Unblock.
00:33:17.685 - 00:33:22.685, Speaker B: Kraken. Binance don't like the UK anymore, so we can't do that.
00:33:23.665 - 00:33:25.605, Speaker A: Oh, is Binance out of the uk?
00:33:26.465 - 00:33:57.565, Speaker B: So you can still offer it but like a load of their products just aren't available. Like they, they got rid of perps a while back and then it feels like every day you get an email. Like the FCA and Binance are just like, it's just, I don't know, I just keep effing myself in my own custody. There's enough on chain now, you don't need it. Like. Yeah, unless you're like trading like 20 million dollar notional perps. It's just like liquidity on chain but like I don't get it.
00:33:58.265 - 00:34:24.764, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, that and me, I'm. I've stopped trading completely. Like I, when I first started in cryptocurrency, that's like how I started was. I was like, I want to trade this and start learning how to do like technical analysis and stuff. And you know, got terrible at it. Not got good, got real. Like I just, just never won.
00:34:26.304 - 00:34:53.357, Speaker B: You know, everyone comes in and everyone wants their immediate. Got like ta and like five minutes scalping and stuff like that. And it's like you're better off just buying something and sitting on your hands. You're probably gonna just get chopped up and burnt a lot, I think. But it's a weird one, isn't it? Like no one comes in and goes, they want to be like a mid to long term investor. Everyone's like, right, I want to trade straight away. It's like, should I sell? Should I rebuy it back? While I was like, I got a lot.
00:34:53.357 - 00:35:00.981, Speaker B: Are you starting to get the texts? Like should I be buying Anything, like from friends and family. Like, I've started to get the text again.
00:35:01.173 - 00:35:04.425, Speaker A: Not this time around yet. You've started to get yours already?
00:35:05.205 - 00:35:09.785, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, but they were kind of like. They were. They were in last cycle.
00:35:10.085 - 00:35:10.517, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:10.581 - 00:35:17.105, Speaker B: Didn't speak to. Didn't speak me for a couple of years. And then like, it's like, what should I. What should I buy?
00:35:18.015 - 00:35:48.367, Speaker A: Dude, I haven't started getting those texts yet. I think I lost too many people, too much money because they're just did. I had everybody like Maxi and into Terra Luna. There's so many people that lost because of me. People don't realize, dude, when shit like that happens, it goes beyond just my financial losses. Like, I was. I was probably more shitty about losing other people's money.
00:35:48.367 - 00:35:55.155, Speaker A: I was like, oh, I had to go around my friends and be like, yeah, dude, I'm sorry, man. I thought I was going to win.
00:35:57.775 - 00:36:17.573, Speaker B: Yeah, we. One of the early Avalanche articles that I wrote was on like, Wonderland Time. And then it's obviously time did really well in the beginning. And I think when I, when. When it all said and done the article, I had like 300,000 unique views.
00:36:17.709 - 00:36:18.149, Speaker A: Oh.
00:36:18.237 - 00:36:41.751, Speaker B: And like, as soon as it started going over, like 150, 200, I was like, oh, shit, this isn't. This isn't going to end well. And like, obviously it was inevitable what was going to happen. It was always going to converge to zero because you kind of print more tokens every single day and like hyperinflate the way out of it. But, like. And like, people would just pop up. Like, if I was on Spaces and be like, what do you feel? What do you think about like, Wonderland Time or people that lost money or not.
00:36:41.751 - 00:37:11.981, Speaker B: It's like, look, I'm gonna. We're gonna report on what is new, what is topical, what is kind of emerging in the industry. Like, if you're not mature enough to read it and take responsibility for your own actions, then I don't really know what to say. Like, nothing would ever get reported on if, like, people were too scared to kind of create content around, like, new things that were happening in the industry. And I was like, no one was. No one was crying when everything was going up and everyone's like making 10% a week or whatever it was. I just don't get people like that.
00:37:11.981 - 00:37:22.477, Speaker B: Like, people want to take responsibility for when they win and then they want to blame it on you when they lose. Like, I just. Just be grown up about it and take responsibility for your own actions, dude.
00:37:22.541 - 00:37:54.017, Speaker A: That's how I feel too, man, Like, I'm such a proponent of make sure you do a heavy amount of research. Make sure you're reading into the docs before you invest in anything. And then you see people just kind of like, fomoing in once you know it. Oh, like, it's 10x. Like, I want to get in. I want a 10x. But you're not actually looking up the opportunity to see if it's even still a possibility anymore, you know? Yeah, I don't know.
00:37:54.017 - 00:38:14.263, Speaker A: It kind of sucks, dude. I have, like, a lot of my family, they're just super shitty about it, and I'm just like, dude, like, I told you to, like, I researched this when Terra luna was at 88 cents. I told you at like, $2. Like, hey, this is. This is the play. Like, it's looking really good. And then you.
00:38:14.439 - 00:38:15.847, Speaker B: What did it hit in the end?
00:38:15.991 - 00:38:25.625, Speaker A: 120, bro. 120. It was the craziest ride I've ever been a part of.
00:38:28.525 - 00:38:30.865, Speaker B: That is absolutely insane.
00:38:31.285 - 00:38:59.955, Speaker A: Yeah, it was. It was. It was bonkers, dude. But I feel like I'm already seeing it's going to be a very similar situation now where people are not going to listen to me. And then, like, the bull run is going to happen. Like, shit's gonna be, you know, going up, going crazy. And then next thing you know, man, around the same time next year, when there's, like, probably gonna be a top, people are gonna be like, you know, what should I be looking into?
00:39:01.415 - 00:39:06.115, Speaker B: You need to let me know when you start getting the texts. And I'll just sell absolutely everything and walk away.
00:39:07.215 - 00:39:15.445, Speaker A: Yeah, my texts are the top, for sure, dude. I got you. I'll probably. I'll probably be selling them their.
00:39:19.185 - 00:39:40.255, Speaker B: I've got loads you can buy off me. Oh, God. Yeah, I know. It's always the same, isn't it? It's like you start hearing it from, like, friends, family. People hear it from colleagues at work, like, Uber drivers talking about it. He's got, like, on his. On his dashboard, on his phone.
00:39:40.255 - 00:39:56.047, Speaker B: He's, like, looking at the chart while he's driving around. Like, always the same. There's always so many top signals. And then, like, in hindsight, it's, like, so obvious, but, like, when you. When you're in. When you're in Lost in the Sauce, it's like, pretty difficult to spot. But everyone's drinking the Kool Aid and everyone's part of the cult.
00:39:56.111 - 00:40:17.457, Speaker A: And, you know, dude, it's hard when stuff is going up, so your money's going Up. So you feel right. You're like, yeah, this is going to keep going up. And then it does. And you're like, okay, I feel right about this. And then you're researching more and more and more partnerships are getting announced. People are becoming more bullish on it.
00:40:17.457 - 00:40:32.045, Speaker A: So they're just. Every time you log on to Twitter, dude, you just see people are just like, fuck yeah. Like, this is gonna. Here's 50 reasons why this is gonna go to a thousand. You're like, sure, dude, fuck yeah. Hell yeah, it's going to 1,000.
00:40:33.065 - 00:40:44.181, Speaker B: And the algorithm as well. On Twitter, it's got a lot to answer for because you interact with a few of those posts in the early days and then all it shows you is like confirmation bias.
00:40:44.293 - 00:40:44.605, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:44.645 - 00:41:15.447, Speaker B: For the foreseeable. And then like, it's probably like a whole host of like Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision Maxis and like Bitcoin Cash Maxis and Cardano Maxis, like, and that none of them come across my like feed ever. But I know they're out there. Just I don't know where they are. Maybe they're hiding on like four channels some shit. But like, the algorithm is so good at showing you shit that it thinks you like. And it's very, very like self reaffirming, particularly if you're in a position.
00:41:15.447 - 00:41:22.303, Speaker B: It's just like, yeah, this is creative. These people are thinking it. They're a lot smarter than me. So.
00:41:22.479 - 00:41:53.393, Speaker A: Dude, that's exactly how you. That's exactly how I felt, bro. I was like, man, I mean, these people are way smarter than me, dude. Like, clearly, like, look at the research people are going doing on chain analytics. And like, I'm like, well, yeah, come on, let's keep going. And you know that mindset works for a bit until it doesn't. That's actually the reason why I kind of started thinking that we were at the bottom like within the last couple months, because it was just like so shitty.
00:41:53.393 - 00:42:19.363, Speaker A: Yeah, it was just. Hell no one, no one was fucking with Crypto whatsoever. Every single day there was a new negative thing coming out. You got Sam Bankman freed on fucking trial, saying random, saying wild things. Oh, dude, that whole saga was just great, by the way. I just needed to say that the.
00:42:19.379 - 00:42:22.413, Speaker B: FT thought he could talk his way out of it, didn't he?
00:42:22.579 - 00:42:30.565, Speaker A: Yes, he did. Yes. I'm just a kid, you know, I made some mistakes. Like, dude, what the fuck are you talking about?
00:42:32.425 - 00:42:53.765, Speaker B: He like. And you know when it all happened and all collapsed and like he was doing like Spaces and shit. I was like, he honestly thinks he can just, like, he's like, smarter than everyone else. He's the smartest man in the room. He can just like, convince everyone his way out of it because he's been. Because obviously everyone around him just told him what he wanted to hear. And like, everyone just, like kissed his ass for so long.
00:42:53.765 - 00:43:08.317, Speaker B: It was just like, obviously just ingrained into his head where he thought, I can just pull the wool over the, like, general public's eyes. And it's just like. And then like, he obviously wanted to take the stand in on the trial. It's just like, he's gonna try and do it again. He's like, have you just not learned anything?
00:43:08.461 - 00:43:30.175, Speaker A: Yeah, I did. Like, don't, don't just. Especially when he took the stand. That is crazy to me because you do not have to do that. And you had. It's. It's so weird, the hubris it takes to actually have done the crime and argue so definitively against you having done the crime.
00:43:30.175 - 00:43:32.935, Speaker A: Like.
00:43:34.955 - 00:43:37.027, Speaker B: Like self aware. Much like.
00:43:37.131 - 00:43:53.505, Speaker A: Yeah, dude, it's just like, I made some mistakes, like. No, you didn't, bro. Like, you. You actively did this. There's like, back doors in your code and shit, bro. Like, you like, literally had to actively, like, want to do this and did it.
00:43:55.285 - 00:44:06.585, Speaker B: All right, I've got some. I've got some quick fires to round us off, right? So with. Did you get a pair of Avalanche Crocs, by the way?
00:44:06.965 - 00:44:17.835, Speaker A: Fuck no, I didn't. And I'm so shitty, I got regular ass Crocs on. I mean, Apple ass Crocs, dude.
00:44:20.455 - 00:44:25.075, Speaker B: All right, so the, the first, the first question is sport mode or relaxed mode?
00:44:25.695 - 00:44:33.915, Speaker A: Oh, dude, it's sport mode all day. What's your. What's your favorite. What's your go to croc mode?
00:44:34.615 - 00:44:36.645, Speaker B: I think I'm more relaxed mode, you know.
00:44:36.775 - 00:44:44.445, Speaker A: Ah, you're relaxed kind of guy. See, I'm gonna get up and go, man. I want to go on a run in these things.
00:44:47.425 - 00:44:49.965, Speaker B: Call of duty 4 or call of duty 5.
00:44:50.345 - 00:45:03.485, Speaker A: Oh, I stopped playing Call of Duty after Black Ops 2. I want to say. Yeah, I stopped playing Call of Duty and then pretty much played Madden exclusively.
00:45:09.445 - 00:45:10.985, Speaker B: Preferred crypto wallet.
00:45:11.645 - 00:45:22.125, Speaker A: Oh, metamask. It's not. And I'm not a diehard. It's just literally like, what, what I was told to go to. Yeah, dude. Literally, I just. So I.
00:45:22.125 - 00:45:47.695, Speaker A: Only reason I even have a wallet is because when I first started in crypto, I had to send my money from one exchange to Another. Which is extremely complicated if it's your first time doing it and you have no one helping you whatsoever. Dude. So I had to make a metamask. I didn't know what the fuck that was. Like, I've literally, like, I have a metamask because I follow directions. I'll put it that way.
00:45:49.355 - 00:45:52.211, Speaker B: You need. You need to get Rab. You need to get a rabby wallet.
00:45:52.363 - 00:45:53.775, Speaker A: A rabby wallet?
00:45:54.155 - 00:45:54.627, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:54.691 - 00:45:57.545, Speaker A: Did I. What. What is. What does Rabi do?
00:45:57.845 - 00:45:59.785, Speaker B: It's change your life.
00:46:00.365 - 00:46:01.861, Speaker A: It'll change my life.
00:46:02.053 - 00:46:03.385, Speaker B: Future of Francis.
00:46:04.085 - 00:46:06.025, Speaker A: I'll get it if Avax pumps.
00:46:14.365 - 00:46:15.985, Speaker B: Apple or Android.
00:46:17.325 - 00:46:35.543, Speaker A: Oh, God, I hate that question. Because I'm. I really don't care. Honest to God. I have an Android. I don't like it, but I also feel like if I. I feel like when I got my iPhone, I also didn't like that as well.
00:46:35.543 - 00:46:37.767, Speaker A: I just. I just. I don't like either.
00:46:37.911 - 00:46:47.047, Speaker B: Can I say you need a flip phone? Yeah, dude, bring back the Nokias3210 indestructible.
00:46:47.191 - 00:46:53.555, Speaker A: Yeah, Brick, throw it against the wall. Like it just did not even get a scratch on it. Like, bring that back.
00:46:58.055 - 00:47:02.835, Speaker B: So digesting content. Is it books or audio books?
00:47:03.815 - 00:47:17.229, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Easily audiobooks. Oh, damn. Actually, that. Damn. I know I said easily, but that is actually a deeper question than I'm thinking because I am reading more books now. I put it like this.
00:47:17.229 - 00:47:38.181, Speaker A: I love the smell of a book. I love the feel of a book. Like, dude, you know what I'm talking about, man. You get you a fresh book and you're just reading it up close to your face and you. Actually, we're going to go a physical book, actually. Yeah.
00:47:38.213 - 00:47:40.093, Speaker B: You can't smell an audio book. That's it.
00:47:40.149 - 00:47:44.285, Speaker A: You can't smell. I mean, you can smell your phone if you wanted to, but I don't know, man.
00:47:44.585 - 00:47:50.805, Speaker B: Maybe that's. Maybe that should be the title for the podcast. I don't think it do well on YouTube for search, but you can't smell an audiobook.
00:47:51.425 - 00:47:57.445, Speaker A: You can't smell the audio. But dude, I wouldn't do well for the search. But good God, is that a great title.
00:48:01.585 - 00:48:02.845, Speaker B: Coffee or Tea?
00:48:03.945 - 00:48:08.169, Speaker A: Easily tea. I actually fucking hate coffee.
00:48:08.257 - 00:48:09.575, Speaker B: Like, really?
00:48:10.195 - 00:48:37.989, Speaker A: So this is why I hate coffee. I'm pissed because coffee smells so fucking great. Like, I remember when I was a little kid, my. You know, my grandparents, they would make coffee and, you know, I would smell it and I'd be like, oh, this smells amazing. And then like, I'd watch them while they're making it, too. Like, it's, you know, it's all calming and meditative. They're putting cream in it, like, and then it changes to that, like, softer brown color.
00:48:37.989 - 00:48:53.181, Speaker A: I'm like, oh, dude, that looks so fucking great. Yeah. Like, I'm like, granny, can I get some of that? She's like, yeah, sure. Pours me off a little cup, and I sip that shit. I'm like, oh, what the fuck? This doesn't look anything. I mean, this doesn't taste anything. Like it looks or smells.
00:48:53.181 - 00:49:01.065, Speaker A: It's just like. Like it smells so gentle and caressing, and then, like, it tastes like a punch in the face, dude.
00:49:05.205 - 00:49:07.141, Speaker B: Rugged by coffee, dude.
00:49:07.173 - 00:49:14.705, Speaker A: Yeah, so, yeah, not. Not a soft rug, either. It's the hardest rug. Fresh after the. I see you.
00:49:16.005 - 00:49:22.421, Speaker B: Right, so a tea it is, then. And how many is the right amount of cups a day of tea?
00:49:22.533 - 00:49:23.061, Speaker A: Infinite.
00:49:23.133 - 00:49:23.813, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:23.989 - 00:49:39.677, Speaker A: As many as my stomach will fit. I. I actually kind of judge myself a little bit because t. T is how I break up the day. Like, you know, I'll work for, like, reward. Yeah, dude. I work for, like, two, two, three hours straight.
00:49:39.677 - 00:50:03.681, Speaker A: And then I'll be like, all right, let me break it up with, like, a tea break, and I'll make some tea and have my whole process swirl it around in the cup. Dude, tea is so meditative. That's. I just love the entire process of it. So everything. If it's not tea and drink as much teachers water and honey. It's healthy.
00:50:03.713 - 00:50:13.245, Speaker B: And I. I've got the final one. Well, I've got Timo, actually, but this one's. I think this one hasn't been received quite well. Pineapple. Pineapple on pizza, yes or no?
00:50:14.425 - 00:50:25.735, Speaker A: Good God. Why is that even a question? That is an absolute. No. That sounds horrid. Oh, no, dude. What's your answer to that question? I'm curious now.
00:50:26.195 - 00:50:36.015, Speaker B: Right, so my answer is. I'm never ordering pineapple on pizza. If there's a slice going spare, this little fatty will definitely eat it.
00:50:43.035 - 00:50:43.347, Speaker A: So.
00:50:43.371 - 00:50:50.649, Speaker B: Yeah, never. Never like, as deranged to actually order a full one. But, like, you know, if there's a special going on, I don't mind it.
00:50:50.817 - 00:51:01.205, Speaker A: Okay. All right, I'll. I'll let you have that, bro. I'm. I'll. If there's a spare slice left, I'll throw that out the window. It's an abomination.
00:51:03.505 - 00:51:05.793, Speaker B: And then the last and most important one.
00:51:05.929 - 00:51:06.361, Speaker A: Yes.
00:51:06.433 - 00:51:09.285, Speaker B: And it's a simple one. Are we back?
00:51:10.345 - 00:51:25.095, Speaker A: Are we back? Dude, we never left, bro. We still here. Doug. Are we still here? Yes. Yes.
00:51:26.635 - 00:51:28.923, Speaker B: I don't know. We managed to survive, but. Yeah.
00:51:29.059 - 00:51:36.775, Speaker A: Are we going to the moon? Elon says yes. Okay.
