00:00:00.240 - 00:00:49.214, Speaker A: Fundamentally, if you want to agree on what Babylon is, we are bringing the highest security from bitcoin at the lowest cost of capital at the doors of proof of stake chains so that they can build their economy. They can build their use case because a majority of proof of stake chains, they fundamentally are aligned with the app chain thesis, right? That they have a use case and they want to really build it. But in order to bootstrap their security before Babylon came, they had to give out a lot of their incentives to try to bootstrap the security. This is where we think Babylon is kind of a game changing technology for app Gen thesis, that we want to incentivize every use case to focus their inflation more towards the use case than just for the security.
