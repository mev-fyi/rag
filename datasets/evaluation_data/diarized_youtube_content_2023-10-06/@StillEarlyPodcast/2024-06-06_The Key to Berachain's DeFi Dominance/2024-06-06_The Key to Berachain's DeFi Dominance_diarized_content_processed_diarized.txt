00:00:17.934 - 00:00:40.416, Speaker A: Welcome back to another episode of Stellali. Sorry, this isn't going out on a Wednesday. Blame KLM Airlines for making me delayed messing up my flight. That was the worst 30 hours worth of travel I've ever experienced and never want to get on a flight again. But this should be with you on Thursday. We'll be back on Wednesdays. As of next week, no flights should be getting in the way.
00:00:40.416 - 00:00:51.656, Speaker A: But we've brought on a return guest, but under a different, under a different banner this time. So. Indeed, Captain Jack, how are you doing?
00:00:51.840 - 00:00:57.124, Speaker B: I'm doing. I'm doing well, Karen. It's good to be back, man. Always a pleasure to be on with the blockmates, lads.
00:00:57.554 - 00:01:21.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I, um, I seen the announcement of, uh, you join in the bearer boys, and I was, uh, it seems, you know, when you see something like, right, that's a good fit. That's like, that's a real. That's a really kind of smart fit. They've got a good one there. Um, and I was just kind of like, happy, happy to see that. But, like, how's that came about? Is it been a. It's been a bit of a whirlwind.
00:01:21.874 - 00:01:23.966, Speaker A: Like, let me pick your brain on that one.
00:01:24.110 - 00:02:00.844, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I appreciate that. And it's definitely kind of come full circle for me. And so I'll give you guys the full lore, which is that back in the. Yeah, way back in the day, I actually minted an OG bonfire. Like, way back during the Olympus days and during the classic Olympus unwind, I, like many others, was over leveraged in Ferrari. And unfortunately, otcd my OG volk bear to try and dig out that position, which was obviously a huge mistake. But I did keep all the rebases and, like, stayed pretty active.
00:02:00.844 - 00:02:26.808, Speaker B: And so I've been around in the, in the broader eco for like two and a half, three years. Let's call it pretty actively. I've known Smokey for coming up on two years now, and even before I applied to Polygon, actually, like, he was the only other person I sent a resume to. It was literally like Polygon. And then Smokey. And Smokey always used to joke with me, oh, it's when, not if you come over. But he's like, yeah, but you're going to hate me if you join right now.
00:02:26.808 - 00:02:46.696, Speaker B: Like, we are just not ready to actually start doing aggressive eco work. And so about, like, eight weeks ago, he hit me up. He was like, hey, if you're ready, I'm ready. And so I kind of put in notice the next week. I was like, yeah, man, it was just too good of a culture fit. Like, I love the community. I like what they're building.
00:02:46.696 - 00:02:49.644, Speaker B: And so, yeah, the rest is kind of history. We'll see where it goes.
00:02:50.264 - 00:03:29.904, Speaker A: Yeah. What I love most about what those guys are doing, what you guys are doing, and in particular Smokey, who I've probably had more conversations with over the past couple of years now. I suppose on the surface I come across as complete idiots, but even, like, the fact that the man management of you're going to hit me if you come now. Because they could have quite easily just, like, had you sat round and, like, waiting in anticipation, like we all are. But no, it's. You always see that, like, under the hood, there's actually a couple of brain cells working together.
00:03:30.404 - 00:03:58.958, Speaker B: I always joke like that they did the opposite of what everyone else thought would be successful, right? Like, everyone always talked about the defi mullet. It's like, you got to be clean in the front and defy DJ in the back. And they were like, nah, I'm going to just do the opposite. Right? I'm, again, as DJ as I can, like, as stupid as I can on the surface. And then in the back, like, when you actually speak to me, it's like, oh, you guys are legit. Like, what? And that was my, you need to.
00:03:58.966 - 00:04:05.398, Speaker A: Have, like, the inverse. The inverse mullet, where it's like the shaved top and the long, long back and sides.
00:04:05.566 - 00:04:09.154, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the monk or something. I don't even know.
00:04:11.054 - 00:04:20.308, Speaker A: It's like one of those. Did you watch, um, what was that recent series, Shogun? Did you watch Shogun?
00:04:20.476 - 00:04:20.924, Speaker B: Man?
00:04:21.004 - 00:04:23.372, Speaker A: It's not good on that, okay?
00:04:23.468 - 00:04:35.624, Speaker B: It's on my list. Like, my girlfriend and I finally finished the other show we were watching, and so I think that one's going to be next because my really good friend and her brother keep telling us to watch it. So I think it's got to happen now.
00:04:37.284 - 00:04:57.362, Speaker A: So what I really wanted to pick your brain on is what the hell is going on with Defi? Why does everyone. Why is it. Why is it kind of everything else getting in the limelight? I know this is your kind of, this is your baby. Like, why the defi bashing? When's Defi gonna be sexy again? I'm ready.
00:04:57.378 - 00:06:23.282, Speaker B: Yeah, man. I think there's like two sides to this, for me the first thing, and this is probably the most important thing and it's something I've been talking about for like six to nine months now. But something I don't think anyone really fully has started to appreciate kind of until now is like before when we talked about Defi, it was like, I mean Aave, I mean uniswap, I mean farming on this platform, I mean x, Y and Z, right? And it was like I'm going to this individual application to do financial activities, I'm doing perps, whatever it is, right. Increasingly the more we get to maturity, a lot of people interact with markets on a day to day basis or they interact with financial applications on a day to day basis like a fintech app on your phone or a banking app on your phone or whatever it is. And they're not cognizantly interacting with finance. It's going to be the same thing. The same way the person who is buying games on the same store trading valve skins on counter strike or whatever else isn't like going oh, I'm going to go do stuff in finance, right? It's just like I'm using an application that will increasingly be true for crypto, right? And what's important about DeFi is that it's the infrastructure that's been battle tested that can handle the accounting and settlement of all these different applications as base primitives.
00:06:23.282 - 00:07:27.426, Speaker B: And over time that list of base primitives has expanded and expanded and expanded as they get more battle tested and we go through new cycles and they become kind of tried and true. And so I think part of it is moving away from just talking about Defi as like a standalone thing and gaming is a standalone thing and nfts are a standalone thing. To like the lines start to get really blurred. And like one of the things I was saying, especially at the end of like 2023 when people would ask me this question was like, look, like Defi is kind of everything in crypto right now, right? Like all of the new stuff that we're talking about all has Defi underpinning it, right? Like fantasy top took things from, took Defi elements across the board in terms of how the marketplaces are structured, in terms of how new mints are handled. Friendtech borrowed bonding curve structures and a lot of these other elements and then turned it into a social fi application. A lot of the different primitives that you've seen, even when they're consumer facing, end up being defi adjacent in some capacity. That's I think the first half of it for me.
00:07:27.426 - 00:07:59.974, Speaker B: And then the second half of it is. And this is like the part that I think is much more me kind of just spitballing and I'm not actually as confident in this is like we're at this. I think a lot of people think we're later in the cycle than we are. And like maybe that's true from like a majors pricing perspective. But what I. What I've seen in prior cycles, right, is you get like the first, it's like the major run up and then you get like the proper alt run up and then you get like the true shitter run up at the very end. And that's kind of the end of the cycle.
00:07:59.974 - 00:08:52.790, Speaker B: And so my perspective on this is like the reason some of these things like meme coins have been so turbo popular is because myself, I'm not exempt from this like many others, right? Like you get so deep into just like staring at this stuff for two years with like it feels like nothing really happening that you kind of just hit like peak apathy, right? And you're like, it's all the same. None of the tokens are worth anything. None of the stocks are worth anything at the end of the day, right? It's all just like growth proxy. Might as well just speculate on the narrative. And so I think like that's kind of where we hit. But at the same time, when I was looking and like talking to all these people building super sick new Defi primitives, no one was like, I'm launching Q 120 24, right? Right. That was really when like they had kind of started to build more aggressively.
00:08:52.790 - 00:09:31.422, Speaker B: And I'm seeing a lot of really new, I think, interesting narratives that are getting ready to come to the market. Some of them, I think are like more modern or more creative options designs, right? Like everyone wanted to build options protocols last cycle. Dovs are generally speaking terrible, right? Like the returns are not good. You're just selling covered calls. It's like, what are we doing here? Uh, and then more complex options products were kind of like squirting this weird line between like retail gamification. Like people want to trade perks on 100 x leverage, right? Like they don't want to figure out how to write like option strategies on chain with shitty lick. Uh, and then institutions were like, well, darabit is just better.
00:09:31.422 - 00:10:52.444, Speaker B: Why would I ever do this on chain? And so you had like this weird thing where if you looked at the majority of the options platforms and I think this is probably still true, you know, they take 30% APY to fuel the liquidity, they generate 10% in volumes. And so it's like kind of just one of the worst businesses in crypto. But now we're starting to see this rotation into new options platforms, which either take uni v three lp, so they don't have to redundantly bootstrap, and use this to replicate different options payoffs, or they might aggregate all strikes and expires across like a rolling liquidity pool, so that way you don't have to redundantly bootstrap, and it makes the protocol more efficient. Right. And so some of these minor changes start to become pretty important. And then also stuff like modular lending, I think is one of my favorite new things kind of happening. It's a little bit of a buzzword salad, but I would really think about that from transitioning from the aves to the morphos Euler Dolomite silos of the world, where you can start to use things like hook functionality to process longer tail assets, you can use asynchronous liquidations, which dolomite has done on, on their new GM assets, where you actually need to be able to effectively construct a liquidation mechanism that can actually handle things like rwas, even where you have to redeem directly with an issuer.
00:10:52.444 - 00:11:27.274, Speaker B: Those are things that we didn't have last cycle that I think are actually really, really meaningful from a composability and a risk tolerance perspective. Whether or not those individual things become the same way that we were working on them last cycle, where it's like, I'm going to this front end to farm this token to do this thing. I think that increasingly those applications will grow because other consumer facing applications will use them as backend infrastructure for what is the b two c element. And some Defi effectively becomes b two b in this universe.
00:11:29.334 - 00:12:07.462, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of impact there. My mind's racing. The first one, with regards to a lot of applications borrowing different aspects, and kind of having this kind of Frankenstein product from all corners of Defi. Like, you see it, like, I did something the other day, like on Instagram, I checked out on Instagram, I probably used someone else's Shopify store, and I used it to buy, like, I don't know, a hat or some shit like that. That's all like amalgamations and composability across these different apps. And everyone thinks like, oh, defi, yeah, composability. Do we ever really get to there? But there are kind of like murmurs of it actually happening, going on the scenes.
00:12:07.462 - 00:12:28.798, Speaker A: So I think that's. I think that's really important. I really did like that about Friendtech. I've seen a couple of protocols use and it can go either way. Like people saying friendtech bonding curve is a little bit too extreme and it priced people out at specific price point and then they shifted to being like a premium, a premium app now.
00:12:28.846 - 00:13:20.284, Speaker B: So only rich people actually like inverse bonding curves I think are a really cool model for something like this, right, where you effectively like reward a community for scale but then also reward people for bag holding, right? And so it's like, you know that meme, like if they have a thousand fans, I'm one of them. Like if they have 100 fans, they have one fan. Like I'm here, right? Like that's like what an inverse bonding curve is basically, right? And there's like some really cool applications that you can do there both across like pure DeFi but also especially for social fi where you know if you are the hardcore like first fan in the club, like you want to snipe it awesome, you can. And then as like more and more people join the community, it gets more and more accessible. And if people start dumping, like the marginal reward for dumping at the top is super low versus like if you're willing to outbag hold everyone else, like you actually get the marginal, the highest, like marginal value.
00:13:21.784 - 00:13:35.144, Speaker A: Yeah, because that was one of the main criticisms. And people like balking out like an ridiculous sum of money just to kind of. And then it just kind of turned into like who can get the best sniper bottom and then who can pick?
00:13:35.184 - 00:13:44.844, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, right. Like, and then you kill the sniping on launch, right? Cause if you want to snipe it, it's like super high cost and like low Roi. Yeah, I totally agree.
00:13:45.744 - 00:14:48.360, Speaker A: But what you're kind of touching on there is like something I've always thought about Barachin as well. And you probably have a much more unique insight into this than, well, a lot of people is. There seems to be this really healthy and I don't know if it's by feature or by design of this one, that the idea that there's going to be a lot of applications on t zero day, one at launch, but two, like we've had a couple of, we do like a separate stream called barometer and there's been a couple of protocols on there and there's been so much overlap between protocol functionality, token composability across tokens. Like some, I can't remember what one of the guys called it, thermonuclear gigaponse. Of course like all these tokens, because it was like layers upon layers upon layers of like, of yield coming from this specific kind of whirlpool strategy.
00:14:48.392 - 00:14:50.448, Speaker B: That was, that sounds like the Yeet guys, man.
00:14:50.576 - 00:15:34.982, Speaker A: Yeah, it was, it was. And I was just like, it's kind of unheard of that at such an early stage, even prior to launch, that all these kind of protocols and a lot of internal talk dynamics have been well thought out. It's in a collaborative nature, and it's kind of like, how do you. This is the only question I have around it. How do you foster a competitive ecosystem and environment without it kind of eating itself, if that makes sense. It's like you want everyone to collaborate, and the more composability and the more collaboration you get as an ecosystem, that's great. But then you also kind of want to encourage competition, because competition is good for the end user as well.
00:15:34.982 - 00:15:37.034, Speaker A: Like where's the trade off?
00:15:39.334 - 00:16:57.478, Speaker B: It's nice, because I think some of that game theory, both on the competition side as well as on the collaboration side, is actually built into the core chain logic with proof of liquidity, right? In that, as I really see it, and I'm sure you guys have covered proof of liquidity to death, so I'm going to kind of skip over that part, unless you think, unless you want to rehash it. But as I really see it, with proof of liquidity, there's almost two game theory outcomes that you can play either as a validator or even as an application. But I think in particular for validators, you can be either a purely profit, economically motivated validator, which is like, I'm going to only put BGT emissions on the applications that give me the most value in terms of their native token, or I can give to users the highest fee, revenue sharing, or whatever else. Or you can be almost like a socially motivated validator. And that might be saying, I am going to return 100% of the value I generate as a validator to projects that I'm working with. And in that case, users might delegate to you because they have native tokens in those projects, and so they want to align their interests in that way. And so it's not explicit profit maximization, but it might be kind of a derivative of it.
00:16:57.478 - 00:17:53.374, Speaker B: You may even have things like community venture studios or VC's running validators, and instead of selling to the highest bidder for BGT, they might direct admissions to projects that they incubate or support from an engineering perspective, or from a community growth perspective, or whatever it is. And so you can end up with different types of symbiosis there, right? And you have both the competitive of for profit motivated validators. I need to outbid the other people that are doing this thing to grow faster or for social alignment. You can say I can actually achieve the same exact outcome, but by working Kumbaya with these other people instead of trying to outbid them. Um, and so there's two different ways to achieve exactly the same end. Um, and you can go either route. And that's kind of, I think what makes it interesting, at different points in time, with different projects, with different validators, there can be different game theory, optimal strategies.
00:17:53.374 - 00:19:40.320, Speaker B: Uh, and then the second thing I think for us especially is like, I'm sure Smokey's talked about this to death, but we really have optimized for native projects, right? And so like, let's say there's between, you know, 100 to 200 people projects that are planning to launch on Vera chain either on Testnet V two or going into main net. And of those 200 projects, 25% to 35% of them are native projects. And so we are doing some basic work, probably to help ensure that the native projects have a very good chance at getting their wheels rolling before a lot of cross chain infrastructure comes in. It's like, let's give these people four to six to eight weeks in the sun to really build up some network effects before we bring over the aaves and the uniswaps and the others of the world, which I think is something a lot of chains don't do. And then you look at their top ten by TVL list and it's like, aave, Uniswap, whatever, sushi all the way down and it's like, okay, well that's why your growth is kind of capped, because there's nothing to do here that I can't do somewhere else, right? And so that's the first element is like actually giving people something unique to do on your chain. And then within that subset, how do you encourage competition and growth? I think it's partially having like altruistic VC mindset, right? Which is like, I'm going to take no tokens from you, but I will identify the narratives I think are interesting, the teams I think that are building really successfully on it, and modern novel mechanism designs and really put my eggs in those baskets. And partially it's going to be market dictated, right? Like if someone is building a native application, but it's a super basic fork of some other thing, the market will say, I'm not that interested in this.
00:19:40.320 - 00:20:02.164, Speaker B: And other builders will say, there isn't that much for me to integrate here. Versus if you're doing something, like, really novel and thoughtful when you have a high quality builder community, that's all really, really defi native, they know too, right? Like, it doesn't just fall to the bear chain team. The community themselves says, like, oh, that's super cool. Like, these are the people I want to work with.
00:20:03.264 - 00:20:09.404, Speaker A: You literally just answered my next question. Like, I've got my notes here. It says, native apps versus attracting the big boys.
00:20:09.784 - 00:20:27.544, Speaker B: Yeah, I do have, like, a little bit to add there, though, in that, you know, I think the big boys are still super interesting. But the mistake I think most chains make, right, is they bring over these big applications and they go, yeah, just do your thing. Deploy normally. This is enough for us.
00:20:27.584 - 00:20:32.016, Speaker A: Right, but usually with a ridiculous grant as well.
00:20:32.160 - 00:21:26.420, Speaker B: Exactly, right? Yeah, exactly. And in my eyes, I think it's actually the opposite. That's interesting for me. Right? Like, if I just wanted a vanilla deployment of these things, you can achieve that same end in a lot less work for a lot less money, right? And so what you're actually paying for for these chains is the brand which legitimizes your brand. I think that's a little bit silly, because at the end of the day, your brand legitimacy should be built on the strength of the work that you're doing, of which paying a ton of money to onboard a blue chip application to their 14th chain, I don't think actually accomplishes quite as much as people think it does. Versus for these cross chain apps, there are, I think, really cool use cases. But what really matters is if you have this Venn diagram of what can I only do on my chain? For some chains, this is a much smaller circle than it should be.
00:21:26.420 - 00:22:19.106, Speaker B: And then you have this other thing, which is like, what does this cross chain application do? What really matters is, like, the overlap of those two sections. And so when I'm talking to these, to these projects, it's like, okay, you know why aave would be really interesting to have on Vera chain in eight to twelve weeks after launch? Because I will have 50 assets that are only available natively on Vera chain. And even for the Verichen native assets, there will be unique functionality that you can run with, right? Like, whether it's with IPGT or whether it's with bear lsts or whether it's with any of these other things that we're working on. And when I ask myself about, like, why would we want Uniswap, right? It's not like, strictly for the Uniswap brand because, you know, v three is open source and all these other things. Right. It's because, you know, with proof of liquidity, I can accomplish different things using Uniswap LP's than Uniswap LP's can do on any other chain. Right.
00:22:19.106 - 00:22:33.974, Speaker B: And so the idea is, like, taking that core Uniswap user base that exists and showing them that there's different things that they can do with their application that they've never seen before. And that, I think, is, like, what's really cool about the cross chain apps, not just the vanilla deployments.
00:22:35.834 - 00:23:16.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely get that. Do you find, like, the larger scale protocols, though? They. They can't be as nimble and as flexible as, like, say, like a native app that's got, like, a little bit more to prove it's got a little bit less risk, can take a bit more risk, should I say? Um, so, like, notoriously, Aave has been like, say, if you're, I don't know, an emerging stable coin project you obviously want, or an emerging Ls. LST. Lido did exceptionally well because steak thief was available on. On Aave from quite an early stage. A lot of stable coins really, really struggle to get listed on Aave.
00:23:16.934 - 00:23:41.434, Speaker A: Things like that. Whereas if there was more of a neighborhood app and there was a burgeoning stablecoin or LST or something like that in the battery and ecosystem, those new emerging apps are more likely to be able to take on that risk. And hopefully they're all isolated markets now, which I'd like to see anyway. But I just think that usually bigger incumbents in the space are less likely to take additional risk and a little bit more gatekeepy, if that makes sense.
00:23:41.594 - 00:24:13.072, Speaker B: Yeah, it does. 100% right. And I think the larger you get, the more risk off you have to be, because the. Right, like, we've seen that from Aave, they've delisted a lot of the more exotic collateral types. They've gotten stricter in terms of listing new collateral types of risk, risk caps and all those other things. I think that's a natural progression, right? Especially as you get battle tested and you hit scale. What you care about is protecting the infrastructure and the network that you've already built out at the same time that then, like you said, opens up an avenue for new disruptors to come into the space.
00:24:13.072 - 00:24:52.302, Speaker B: And we started to see that. Right. Like, I. Regardless of what your intakes are, I've found the debates between Mark Zeller and the morpho guys to be really, really interesting, right? And I've been reading through the Euler V two white paper, and I find some of that structuring really cool. And I look at silo and Dolomite and some of the unique products that they're creating around Pendle or GMX or any of these other applications, and it's obvious that Aave can never do any of those things. And then even on bear chain, we have people like gummy coming, and they're going to be able to run Oracle. Less lending on long tail, more exotic assets.
00:24:52.302 - 00:25:46.026, Speaker B: And those are all niches that aave can never occupy. And so at the end of the day, as we get natural progressions in demand for new types of things, you end up being able to progress beyond that core functionality. But then the one thing I think also does matter is from a risk perspective on a new chain, you want to give people the opportunity. If they are aave, people that have bridged a bear chain at the end of the day, when they've had time to experience the ecosystem and they really enjoy using it and they want to move more capital over, but they're not sure where to deploy it immediately, giving them that place where they can put that capital in a really trust minimized way does go a long way. I think that's the component. And over time that decreases as new applications get to that battle tested hard in place. In the meantime, it means that you can do cool stuff where it's like, I want to launch a new token.
00:25:46.026 - 00:26:39.104, Speaker B: Well, if I have Oracle list lending that works with almost any amount of liquidity, then I can on token launch have, let's say an integration into exponents on the perp side that uses the uni V three liquidity to facilitate the leverage and then also have gummy on the oracle less lending side. And so now you can go long short with leverage and borrow against that asset immediately. And you can also do weird stuff within those applications where you can create PvP mini games where it's like eyes, a protocol will incentivize the user of the perp stacks to go short my competitor's token and long my token. And then like on the gummy leverage side, right? Like incentivize borrowing against it to loop it, right? And then all of a sudden you get like insane metagames that can be played that obviously like Aave would never be a part of.
00:26:41.124 - 00:27:17.782, Speaker A: I guarantee that will happen. Knowing, how do you stop protocols? Like it's like one last one on, like the kind of the old defi dinosaurs before we move on. But Ave curve, they begin to look like the same thing. They're gonna look like the same thing. At one point it seems like everything's convergent and it feels like there's only someone described as like the taco Bell recipe where there's like eight ingredients and there's only like a certain amount of ways you can repackaging.
00:27:17.838 - 00:27:20.834, Speaker B: I have a lending market stable swab.
00:27:21.684 - 00:27:28.344, Speaker A: Do they just get so big that they have to push into new revenue streams or what do you think is going on there?
00:27:29.404 - 00:27:57.670, Speaker B: It's a good question. I think the answer is no, by the way. I think there's different ways to approach this. I guess even just coming from trad five, you get to this point where it's like, okay, how do I continue to scale? How do I continue to grow my margins? I think we've seen from people like Uniswap, you don't really have to. Uniswap just keeps building new swap architectures and that's their lane, and it's working really well for them. And they continue to generate solid revenues off their front ends. Wow.
00:27:57.670 - 00:28:59.078, Speaker B: I'm going to try not to be too spicy here because I have to be semi political. I'll be a little spicy. I think that a lot of what these applications are doing is the downside of, like, having a Dao governance structure that's completely separated out from some sort of labs entity in that, like, sometimes the labs entity just like be doing shit and then it kind of ends up falling to the dow to actually help them execute on it. And at the end of the day, like, I don't, I really, really like a lot of, a lot of aave and I really like a lot of the team there, but I also look at go and I'm like, wow, this has been such a massive headache relative to the amount of value that it's created, which is very, very little. Right. And so it's like, did it really make sense to launch a stable? When I look at it, I wonder, like, regardless of how, you know, I don't want Mark coming after me. Like, I'm aware it's hyper revenue efficient and like all these other things, but at the same time, what does go really offer that other stables in the market can't? It's not more capital efficient strictly, it's not higher yield, it's not any of these other things.
00:28:59.078 - 00:29:29.742, Speaker B: And so it suffers from a lot of peg pressure as a result. Right. People want to borrow it to buy better stables, better stables and even shifting and splitting of focus across all of these different sub verticals where it's like Aave has lens now and Aave has Aave core and v three. Right. And then they also have go. And at the end of the day, everyone starts converging on some of the same products because that's what has product market fit. And you want to continue growing.
00:29:29.742 - 00:29:55.810, Speaker B: Do I think it's necessary? No. I did at least appreciate that. With curve, there's the core stable swaps. And then they also, with CRV USD, expanded into something that made sense. They had really deep stable liquidity. They built what I thought was a pretty novel architecture and Lama and some of the iterations that they've done there. And so there was cool tech to take away.
00:29:55.810 - 00:30:10.330, Speaker B: And so there were some minor advantages, but even still. Right, like CrvusD was more of a, Mitch is like the kind of guy that builds stuff that he wants to use. And so it was like, okay, right. Like there was clearly like a use case, at least for Mitch here.
00:30:10.522 - 00:30:11.786, Speaker A: Real estate market.
00:30:11.970 - 00:30:52.424, Speaker B: Exactly. And so, and so there is like that small edge there. But yeah, I think, like, your point is totally justified, and that's, I think, part of the nature of the beast. I would prefer to see these things be like, truly separated out over time. And that's the beauty of composability of the stack, is you don't need to have all of these things fall under the same umbrella. It can be effectively like a subsidiary or like a subdao maker style that builds on top of the core architecture, but it's fundamentally distinct. So that way there isn't as much like overlapping contamination and like, product scope and scope creep 100%.
00:30:55.324 - 00:31:13.444, Speaker A: How do we stop this whole cookie cutter points, airdrop, terrible attempt at half assed marketing. Like, how do we stop this? Because it feels like it's to be expected now.
00:31:14.224 - 00:31:25.912, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to leak too many good ideas, though. This is the hard part. I have so many cool ideas around this. I'll talk about a high level. Right. And so, like, yeah, don't give the.
00:31:25.928 - 00:31:30.640, Speaker A: Game away because people will listen and will definitely, I'll give some of it away.
00:31:30.672 - 00:32:01.130, Speaker B: I'll give some away. If you can replicate it efficiently, then hats off to you. I think at a baseline, points are, for me, if you remember from the Olympus nowadays, they had that shirt in that meme, which was the elephant sucking its own dick. That's points. It's like, I issue points before I have a token live. So people flock in and add value to my protocol. And then I do another private fundraise or I boost my baseline stats so that the theoretical value of my protocol increases.
00:32:01.130 - 00:32:47.960, Speaker B: So the future theoretical value of points increases that because they're tied to a governance token of some sort. And so the value of the governance token goes up and so the value of future expected emissions go up. So more TVL comes in, right? And you get like this, a little bit of like a recursive cycle that's actually anchored against literally nothing other than other people speculating on the points value, right? And so it's like this weird derivative market that I think does kind of very little and has a lot of Fugazi obfuscation behind it. It also, I think, really stretches out the cycle that you have to be committed to something for, right? And so we've seen, I think people do this better than others. I think Athena in many ways did a solid job of this. Like they said, here is our number. Once we hit this number, token will go live.
00:32:47.960 - 00:33:36.292, Speaker B: And they did that. I'm curious to see how the Infinix rollout goes out. It was basically like a one month pre deposit campaign. And so let's see, we'll see if they can stick to that. Some of these shorter timeframes I think are reasonable, almost as like pre deposits to seed. What I really don't like is when you have these three six month points periods, and then you launch 5% of your token supply and that's season one, and then you continue with another 5% for season two and it's just like the most value extractive thing. And it becomes this cat and mouse game of like mercenary activity where the users are getting increasingly jaded because they're getting strung along and the projects are recognizing that their users are mercenaries, so they want to string them along.
00:33:36.292 - 00:34:24.416, Speaker B: And I don't know, it's just like a really weird PvP dynamic. And so points in general, I think are not great. I think there's ways that you can achieve similar outcomes, though, while being more transparent, right? Where you can give like locked or vesting token models that still allow you to play pendle games on top of them, while giving users more direct visibility into exactly how many tokens they'll have and like what supply will look like and what the amount of emissions are over a certain period. I think for like pre deposit and lockdrop campaigns, like those like rub me the worst. It's like you just have capital sitting idle for literally no reason. Like it's not even deployable into an application and it's like, oh, but we're giving you the native yield like sick man. I have a massive opportunity cost of capital here.
00:34:24.416 - 00:35:29.832, Speaker B: Like that is not it. But I think there are ways that you can do it more creatively. One of the coordination mechanisms that's been going around lately, and Roico, I think there's probably a cool way to apply that to a pre deposit campaign where rather than just taking TVL and having it sit generically in a multi sig doing nothing, you can actually allow application. You can basically have this lock drop campaign going and then have applications start bidding for that liquidity, and users allocating that liquidity based on bids in that pre deposit period. Now it becomes like an order matching period where you as a user then know exactly what your payoff will be by allocating to different applications. And then rather than just seeing an ecosystem broadly and hoping that on mainnet launch, that liquidity stays there and people don't just instantly rug and withdraw and then making mercenary mechanisms against that, you actually have users commit to locking that capital for some period of time in an application on mainnet launch. And so all of a sudden from day zero, all that liquidity is productive.
00:35:29.832 - 00:35:43.704, Speaker B: And so there are much more thoughtful ways to do it. I would like to see us head there. I think the current meta is pretty disappointing, but I think borrowing pieces of it is super meaningful.
00:35:44.124 - 00:36:17.564, Speaker A: Yeah, you don't have to throw the baby out with the bath water. That I think there is, there is aspects to it where you could be a little bit more savvy. I just, I just get kind of sick and tired of people just, it's laziness out of anything when you just kind of see like just a recurring. And if particularly it's a, it's a points based program that is, I don't know, volume or tvl based. It's so undimensional that it's just like, come on. And like going back to using like Olympus as an example. Like after all the Olympus forks, everyone knew the game, like after the, after time.
00:36:17.564 - 00:36:41.554, Speaker A: And then there's like every new chain had an Olympus fog. Everyone knew, right, just get this thing as early as physically possible, feed it as many, see if you can keep it alive for five days and then you've made your maximum profit. It's like everyone knows how to play the points game now. Everyone knew how to play the pool two game, like, like it's just the same shit. Yeah, it's, it's liquidity mining where the team gets to decide how many tokens they give you at the end.
00:36:42.854 - 00:37:06.314, Speaker B: That's almost the worst part, right? It's like decided ex post and so the team can back into whatever math they made sense. And there was no initial commitment, right. It should be in an environment where like, you know, if you're expecting $10 million and you get $100 million, that should effectively be, be like a part of the game when now it's like, oh, I got 100 miles. Awesome. Sucks to be you guys.
00:37:09.734 - 00:37:41.854, Speaker A: What are, what are the, why is this such a, I've kind of got my own thoughts on it, but why is there such a huge developer activity happening on barrechain? Are people sick of the same, like, twelve users? Do they want like a large user base? Do they want that? Does proof of liquidity play into any kind of liquidity commitments there? Like, they want more liquidity. What do they want? And why are they so, like, why is this such a kind of burgeoning community over there with, in particular with developers?
00:37:42.194 - 00:38:32.850, Speaker B: It's a good question. I think there's a few elements to it. One is that the, if you'll pardon my french here, technical circle jerk of I want my chain to be faster and cheaper is good, right? Like, having a fast, cheap chain with good ux is super important. But at a certain point, right, the marginal reward of that relative to the incremental cost is very, very meaningless. And at the end of the day, it becomes more of like a game of technical alignment and validator alignment and vc alignment as it actually does, like user and builder alignment. And I think that was like a big portion of it, right? Like proof of liquidity. And bear chain generally aren't trying to be an ETH killer, right? Like, we're not coming out here and saying like, this is going to be what ends eth.
00:38:32.850 - 00:39:24.346, Speaker B: We're faster and better. It's like, no, there's a different metagame to be played here than there is on any other chain. And you will have a good time playing it because it will cause alignment in different ways. And even down to the perspective of like, I was doing some math a couple days ago just for fun, where I looked at how many of the new l one s pay more in yearly inflation to validators. And so that's staking market cap multiplied by yearly staking yield. Then they have TVL on the chain, and it's more than you'd think. And even for those that don't, it might be 20 or 50% of yearly staking yield paid to over TVL and so it's like, okay, well, that's clearly not value aligned.
00:39:24.346 - 00:40:32.334, Speaker B: And so ecosystems are effectively, like, overspending on economic security relative to economic activity. And so why not just build some level of, like, game theory and alignment there into the chain level? And so I think from, like, an intellectual and a crypto native perspective, those elements really appeal to builders because they're designed to cater to builders and users beyond just like, technical alignment, but it's like social alignment as well. And then I think the other thing is, Barachain is many things. There's a lot of words you could use to describe it, but I think the biggest one and the most meaningful one is probably authentic. Say what you will about whether or not you think the metagame is interesting or whether it will work, or whether it's a giant ponzi or whether the founders are retarded or whatever it is, but at the end of the day, everyone is genuinely themselves in the same way that I feel the early, like, my lady community had that feel of, like, I don't know what neo Chibi Tokyo aesthetics are, but I know it when I see it. Right? Like, bear chain's the same way. It's like, I don't.
00:40:32.334 - 00:40:58.654, Speaker B: I don't know what it means to be bear pilled, but, like, you'll know it when you see it. And I think a lot of the builders kind of, like, bought into that energy where it felt like there was a community that was beyond just like, oh, there's going to be a token launch here, or, oh, you know, this founder raised $2 billion from a 16 z. Right. It was really like, this feels crypto native in a way that I think, like, many other projects don't.
00:40:59.834 - 00:41:21.468, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think there's been a. Not just in this, not just in our industry, but I think globally, I think there's. People have just had enough of inauthentic bullshit, really. And you can't. I was saying this to Jerry, sir. You're seeing that kind of knee jerk from that and, like, the flip side of that coming out, and it's.
00:41:21.468 - 00:41:43.950, Speaker A: It's coming out in, like, someone's. As well as like, some. Some good ways. But I think people are just fucking fed up of, like, bullshit. Like I say, I order pivoted to, like, a parallel evm l two fucking ultimate availability. Some fucking shit earlier. And I was just like, what is going on? Like, what is happening in this space? And, like.
00:41:43.950 - 00:42:14.324, Speaker A: And I think that's in a roundabout way, like, why meme coins are completely ripping and have stole the show the past year. Like, people are just fed up with like, being authentic bullshit. And I know you can definitely argue there's a lot of insider information that goes on with regard to meme coins, but sometimes, like, they can be as pure as they can physically be off the back of just an image, do you know what I mean? And people are just like, I do. That's all I want.
00:42:14.664 - 00:43:00.874, Speaker B: I subscribe equally to the left curve and the right curve of crypto. I think when done in the pure form, meme coins can be super, super interesting and very, very culturally aligned in that it's like, there isn't anything more than this to what you want it to be. And it's up to the community to kind of make it that. And yeah, like there are whatever cabal coins and all these other things. But also I remember seeing every single NFT mint absolutely, like rigged for certain groups. And I remember seeing every single private round featuring the same 15 people that would then launch at like 15 x, right? And so it's not as though these games don't exist everywhere else as well. They just always take a different shape.
00:43:00.874 - 00:43:37.586, Speaker B: But there are like, as someone that was, I don't know, in wif at whatever two cent and in Costco hot dog at 250K market cap. Like, there are things out there where you see it and you just go. The way I always think about it is like the meme should be axiomatic, right? It refers to nothing other than itself, and that's all you need. And it's like when you saw whiff, it was like, yeah, it's a dog with a hat. Like, that's pretty funny. And when I saw the hot dog, it was like, yeah, man, like, that's going to a buck 50. And I remember I was even joking with my dad, right, who's not really in crypto at all.
00:43:37.586 - 00:44:12.936, Speaker B: And he, I was telling him about the Costco hot dog coin. He's like, oh, I heard they might raise it to $1.75. And I said to him, oh my God, that's so bullish. Now I have extra $0.25 upside. And he thought it was hysterical, right? And so there are like these elements of these things where even if they, even if people don't get exactly why it is, they kind of get the culture around it. And I think that's the portion that's good about attracting people to crypto, right? It's like give them a taste of like how non seriously the community takes itself and then allow them to use that to investigate a lot of the infrastructure that's been built.
00:44:12.936 - 00:44:28.118, Speaker B: Like, that's how I got into the space. I'm sure that's how many others. Like you start with food farms, and then you look at how pumped up fund operates from a bonding curve perspective and how radium operates and how all these other things work, and all of a sudden you're starting to get into the trenches.
00:44:28.286 - 00:44:30.478, Speaker A: Yeah, I wanted to ask you on pumped up one.
00:44:30.646 - 00:44:31.182, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:31.278 - 00:44:40.526, Speaker A: Because that's kind of like half a million tokens launched on Solana last month. They're bringing in stupid revenue.
00:44:40.670 - 00:44:43.354, Speaker B: Yeah, like a million bucks a day.
00:44:43.894 - 00:45:07.684, Speaker A: When I first I heard them, the alliance, not a pitching of podcast, but the alliance guys have got alliance. They guys have got a podcast. And I think they incubated pump fun and they had them on for like ten minutes to kind of like, tell people about the product. I was like, what? Anyone can launch a token. I was like, that's not going to end well. Five minutes later, I'm like, shit, I'm addicted to this.
00:45:09.504 - 00:45:13.244, Speaker B: Like, the flashing lights and it's constantly rotating and vibrating. You're like.
00:45:17.184 - 00:45:21.544, Speaker A: Do you think that's just like a. One of those. Right time, right place?
00:45:22.404 - 00:45:36.564, Speaker B: Yeah. Right time, right place. I think simplicity is always good. I think, like, a lot of people try and overcomplicate things. Like get something out to market, see what the reception is, see if it works, and then go from there. Right? Like at a baseline. What they created is so simple.
00:45:36.564 - 00:46:21.080, Speaker B: It's like the worst, best ux of all time. It's like curve in that way, right? It does exactly what you need it to do, but you look at it and like, og curve was disgusting in the best way, right? And so I think, like, it kind of nailed that niche. And most importantly, right, like, I think that a lot of people get lost in the sauce of building infrastructure, right? It's like, I need this, like, I was like we were talking about earlier, like, I need this to be marginally faster. I need this to be marginally more secure. No, it's like, what I need is to make interacting with all of this infrastructure as easy as possible and as fun as possible. And, like, they clearly accomplished that. And so I think it's one of those examples of.
00:46:21.080 - 00:46:37.424, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Like, right place at the right time, but also the right execution. Like, it's. There's. There's a lot of applications out there that I've seen where I'm like, okay, this has the potential, and I'm sure you've seen as well like this has the potential to do really well. It's launching at the right time, but the execution was just a little bit off. Right.
00:46:37.424 - 00:46:52.004, Speaker B: It felt inauthentic or it was too complicated or the UX was wrong or you know, whatever. There's just like so many hiccups and so at some point it's just about like getting lucky too, right? And having the right, the right moment.
00:46:52.704 - 00:47:09.262, Speaker A: Is there any. I know you, it's like you've got like many children in the bar chain ecosystem. So you can't have like a favorite. I don't, I don't mean a favorite. Is there anything. I know you're a complete defined nerd as, as well as me. Is there anything that's being like, yeah, this is, this is really cool.
00:47:09.262 - 00:47:19.502, Speaker A: This is cool as shit. Or something like you've just like never really seen before that you've seen like within the ecosystem. I had the puffball guys on, yeah, puffball is crazy.
00:47:19.598 - 00:47:51.812, Speaker B: I love that one. It's like, yeah, maybe I'll start smoking six just to quit with them. Yeah, puffball, super interesting, right? Like it's been funny because I've seen vape to earn come up on my timeline 50 times and I'm like, oh, we're building that. Or rather puffa is building that. I think there's a lot of really cool stuff and I'm going to miss so many thoughtful builders. And maybe next time I'm on we'll talk through more. I think some of the ones that right off the bat that I think have been really fun from an interactions perspective as well.
00:47:51.812 - 00:48:29.120, Speaker B: From a composability perspective is kind of what I mean are the overlap of things like a baseline model with an up only token, assuming they can get it working with the new launch. I think it went live actually last night. Like with a baseline model where you have up only thinner liquidity in the center range plus a gummy and an exponents, right. And so baseline gives you v three liquidity exponents, allows you to leverage on v three liquidity. Higher trading activity on the v three pair like ratchets your floor up so you get higher non liquidatable leverage price. Baseline has the built in leverage. Gummy can amplify that as well.
00:48:29.120 - 00:49:20.004, Speaker B: And so all of a sudden you have a product that's like up only token high volatility and convexity on steroids. Like that's going to be a good time, right? I think like one of the other ones, I've spent a lot of time on that. I think is really cool, is concrete. And so they're going to do some really cool work around offering like fixed rate, fixed term, almost like insurance or downside protection on things like lending. And some of these other markets, they have some broader plans in terms of application building, but also then from a structuring perspective, you can do some really cool stuff around, like taking all these fixed rate, fixed term loans across different durations and different rates and packaging them into structured products, right. Like basically mortgage, mortgage backed securities. And then based off of the underlying, like, creditworthiness as determined by the end consumer, right.
00:49:20.004 - 00:49:52.642, Speaker B: Like an aave or a compound will have a much lower fixed rate than something that's much more novel. And so you can end up with these kind of like differently graded assets within these packages and use them as variable yield products, right. Um, and I thought that was like really, really thoughtful and especially from the actual structuring perspective. You know, you talk to the, to the team over there and it's like, okay, these guys know what the hell they're doing. And I thought like, that, that one was, was really good as well. But yeah, it's like almost hard. I, I've been at Verichen now.
00:49:52.642 - 00:50:28.764, Speaker B: This is my fourth week. I've spent probably like six to 8 hours a day, every day, just meeting eco teams. And just the sheer like, breadth of it is absolutely crazy. And I think even trying to talk through them all would be doing a disservice just because the intensity and thoughtfulness of the builders is super, super meaningful. It's a different culture than I've seen literally anywhere since I've been in Defi. It almost reminds me of OG Defi summer, where everyone is just camped out in a discord talking through crazy ideas.
00:50:29.824 - 00:50:41.524, Speaker A: Love it. Is there anything that you want to bring up that we might have missed off? I know we've been on a couple of tangents and things like that there, but if there's anything on top of mind that you want to bring up.
00:50:41.944 - 00:50:43.684, Speaker B: This shows live tomorrow.
00:50:45.264 - 00:50:48.616, Speaker A: Yeah, 6 June 6 June.
00:50:48.680 - 00:51:09.640, Speaker B: All right. Berry chain v two testnet coming soon. Coming very soon. Uh, it's going to be exciting. Bear chainview one testnet, uh, obviously, um, million users in seven days has uh, a little bit of effect of breaking things. Um, and so it's going to be pretty meaningful. Like some, some really big changes in terms of the execution.
00:51:09.640 - 00:51:35.830, Speaker B: Client like, remains proof of liquidity. On the, on the consensus side, execution is now no longer, um, precompile compatible to evm. It's fully evm identical. You can use any eth client out of the box scaling RPC. All that good stuff should be orders, excuse me, orders of magnitude better. I think that's going to be really meaningful. View of liquidity basically will be out with the v two testnet.
00:51:35.830 - 00:52:02.854, Speaker B: And so people actually get to start seeing the effects of the pol flywheel, playing around with it, working with validators, all that really good stuff. I'm super, super excited for that, to go live beyond that. I think it's just like a pretty exciting time to be checking out vera chain. And things are moving a lot faster behind the scenes than you think. And so definitely will be a great summer, I think.
00:52:03.314 - 00:52:23.646, Speaker A: Well, there we have it. I'm going to have to get over and figure that shit out before mainnet goes live because there's going to be a lot of people scrambling to figure out what the hell is going on. And I want to be kind of ahead of the curve there because there's going to be so many moving parts, so many projects, so many talking flywheels that I'm not getting left behind. I'm not being that guy.
00:52:23.830 - 00:53:11.260, Speaker B: Yeah, there's going to be so many different metagames too around. Like, you know, you take your LP receipt tokens, you have to stake them in BGT station to earn your BGT. But then there's going to then be like an opportunity cost potentially of composability in the early days until people start building out all the adapters. And I think like, especially in the early days, it's really going to feel completely novel from like a discoverability perspective relative to a lot of these other things where, like you said earlier, with points and with food farms and with all these other things, right. Or Olympus, it became solved, right? Like, you knew what you were doing and what the game theory optimal decision was. And like, I'm excited for that moment of like, you know, back when I was a kid and playing Pokemon or whatever, and there wasn't like an Internet guide that you could turn to. And it was like, I have to figure out what the hell is going on.
00:53:11.260 - 00:53:20.004, Speaker B: Like, how do I do this? Yeah, exactly. And I don't know, I'm ready to go in with a sense of childlike wonder and whimsy into baritone too.
00:53:21.384 - 00:53:24.616, Speaker A: Also, I need that t shirt as well if they've got some match.
00:53:24.800 - 00:53:29.800, Speaker B: If you're going to be at ECC, let me know. I'll hook you up. All right.
00:53:29.832 - 00:53:42.994, Speaker A: Well, Jack, again, open invite whenever. I always enjoy these conversations. So you guys are pushing stuff. Just let us know. We'll run it back and we'll leave any of the links that we've chatted about below. And yeah, thanks a lot, everyone. See you next time.
