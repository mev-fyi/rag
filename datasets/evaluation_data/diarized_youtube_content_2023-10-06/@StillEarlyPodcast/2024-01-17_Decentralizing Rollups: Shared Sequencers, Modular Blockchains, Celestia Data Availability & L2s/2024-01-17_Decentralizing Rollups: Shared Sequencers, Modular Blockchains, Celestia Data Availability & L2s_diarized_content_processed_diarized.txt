00:00:00.200 - 00:00:55.900, Speaker A: So node kit, what we're building is we're building seq, which is our shared sequencer, L1, which allows ropes to easily decentralize their sequencing while maintaining flexibility as well as reliability while keeping low latency, which is crucial. That's the biggest thing about a shared sequencer is you're going from a centralized solution, that all you have to do is basically have as fast as possible connection to an AWS box of as low as latency as possible. And from that you have to go from there to decentralized. So latency is kind of the bane of our existence on all of this stuff. It's very tricky to figure out in a distributed systems manner. But that's the main thing that we're solving for is shared sequencing, which allows multiple roll ups to use the same network of shared sequencers so you don't have to bootstrap a secured network for every single roll up. Much simpler than trying to launch a new share new sequencer for every roll up a new distributed sequencer network.
00:00:55.900 - 00:01:11.660, Speaker A: So that's what we've kind of built. We're using snowman consensus, which is very reliable. It's been used in a bunch of different applications so far. Way we look at it, if it's good enough for JPMorgan and Citibank to use, it's probably good enough for loops around the world to be using GM.
00:01:11.692 - 00:01:38.222, Speaker B: So just a quick one before we get started. So, still early is podcast for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Any investment decision you should make should be based on your own research and your own understanding of the risks involved. So yeah, that's it for me. Let's get on with the show. All right, we're back still early. I think it's the first one I've done since new year.
00:01:38.222 - 00:02:13.324, Speaker B: So happy new year, everyone listening and thanks for all support so far. That subscriber growth is increasing drastically after me painstakingly asking and doing my job as a host of the podcast. But today I'm super excited for this one on an extremely selfish level because a lot of what nodecate are doing and Noah's going to get into it is primarily coming up in a lot of my own personal research. So this is like the perfect opportunity for me to be the idiot in the room here and honestly just pick, pick your brain of what's going on. But no, no. How's it going, mate? Are you good?
00:02:13.944 - 00:02:23.324, Speaker A: It's going great today. We're excited to be on your mind and in the minds of research everywhere currently, especially if all the roll ups going down lately.
00:02:24.094 - 00:02:50.784, Speaker B: Honestly, the amount of kind of. Sometimes it's quite difficult to. I don't like to over prepare too much. I think it can get a bit rigid sometimes. But on this one I was just like, needs to ask this, I need to ask that. And sometimes it's quite difficult to actually prep for stuff like this because sometimes it can often be a vanilla product. But there's so many angles to of go down here.
00:02:50.784 - 00:03:02.524, Speaker B: But I actually want to, want to get straight into it. Can you kind of give myself in the audience like a high level what you guys are doing and maybe even just touch on your role in delivering all this?
00:03:03.064 - 00:03:36.840, Speaker A: Yes. So currently roll up sequencers, which is essentially the thing that is making these sequence blocks for rollups. So think of a sequencer as a solo validator essentially for an entire roll up. So sequencer is typically centralized in a lot of these roll ups, and that can cause downtime because of any centralized component. If it goes down, then you don't have transactions. And we've done calculations in the past that not having transactions for an hour leads to a lot of trades not going through, a lot of markets being moved, and overall a lot of negative effects. So nodecate.
00:03:36.840 - 00:04:25.600, Speaker A: What we're building is we're building seek, which is our shared sequencer, l one, which allows ropes to easily decentralize their sequencing while maintaining flexibility as well as reliability while keeping low latency, which is crucial. That's the biggest thing about a shared sequencer is you're going from a centralized solution, that all you have to do is basically have as fast as possible connection to an AWS box with as low as latency as possible. And from that you have to go from there. So decentralized. So latency is kind of the bane of our existence on all of this stuff. It's very tricky to figure out in a distributed systems manner. But that's the main thing that we're solving for, is shared sequencing, which allows multiple roll ups to use the same network of shared sequencers so you don't have to bootstrap a security network for every single roll up.
00:04:25.600 - 00:04:47.664, Speaker A: Much simpler than trying to launch a new sequencer for every roll up a new distributed sequencer network. So that's what we've kind of built. We're using Snowman consensus, which is very reliable. It's been used in a bunch of different applications. So far way we look at it, if it's good enough for JPMorgan and Citibank to use it's probably good enough for roll ups around the world to be using.
00:04:48.524 - 00:05:08.014, Speaker B: Absolutely. So how do you fit into this personally then? So like kind of, what's your. I won't say day to day, because that's just like a silly term in this industry. We were even chatting about it off like, no two days are the same. It's kind of weird, wonderful and wild all at the same time. But kind of what, what's, what's kind of taken up a lot of your mind share data at Nokit?
00:05:08.954 - 00:06:16.154, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of my mind share on the day to day is live development, a lot of hiring stuff as well. And the biggest thing that we try and look at is how can we make this experience the best possible and making sure that any features we add are also usable immediately. Because the way we kind of look at it is you could build the best bridge in the world, you could build the best wall, you could build the best anything. But if nobody uses it, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. So we've really had a heavy focus on adoption and also making sure any features we plan to build out or are building out are easy to use for a user, seamlessly integrated at the closest level to the user possible. And really figuring that out, that's really the day to day. And also making sure anything that we're also building doesn't have negative side effects, essentially, because as you distribute these systems, you can run into things like mev as well, which is something that obviously it's pretty impossible to get it to zero, but there's a lot of different ways on how you can make sure that your users aren't just getting front run left and right, because going from a centralized solution, they typically aren't getting front run left and right.
00:06:16.154 - 00:06:27.070, Speaker A: So you want to avoid things like that. And yeah, it's a lot of planning, but also a lot of development as well. At the node kit team, we're still small, so everybody wears multiple hats.
00:06:27.262 - 00:06:59.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I can only imagine. So what's the kind of general consensus and pain points across? Because you do see it come up a lot in research forums, discussions on current established l two s, and like, what's the kind of sequence of landscape? And what's the kind of what's on, what's like from the inside out? Like what, what is everyone speaking about at the minute? Can you even give us a bit of a primer on what the actual sequencer does if someone's coming and called? And what's the current thoughts on that aspect of the network.
00:07:00.264 - 00:07:38.286, Speaker A: Yep. So currently sequencers, are these distributed, are these centralized systems that are essentially making the blocks for the roll ups? And that is currently what a centralized sequencer does. To kind of give you background on other people in the space as well, is kind of how nude kit differs. So there's Espresso systems, who's built a distributed sequencer, distributed shared sequencer, and a data availability network that they call Espresso sequencer. And then there's also Astra, who has their own sequencer as well. Espresso, as far as we can see from an outsider looking in, Espresso's secured by Eigen layer and they have. That's kind of the big thing.
00:07:38.286 - 00:08:09.770, Speaker A: It's also very fast finality, because they've built out their own consensus algorithm. And then Astria, I believe, is still using tendermint. And then Astra focuses a lot more on sovereign roll ups. And at nude kit, we focus on both sovereign and smart contract roll ups. We really have a heavy focus on flexibility and also reliability. We chose to not build our own consensus algorithm because we didn't want to have to go through all of the painstaking hard work that comes with that. But it also is the painstaking hard work of getting people to trust new consensus algorithms.
00:08:09.770 - 00:08:54.984, Speaker A: It's very difficult, and obviously you can make lots of optimizations, but the way we look at it is choosing to use snowmen consensus, which choosing to use something that has been proven to be very reliable, which Tenderman is also very reliable, but Snowman is a bit more performant. So that was kind of the choice behind that. So that's kind of. I would say that's the major players in the space right now. And we also focus on being very flexible around TA layers, which is very important for rollups, especially now that we've seen kind of the rise of different roll ups, having different partnerships with DA layers. They want that flexibility and they don't want to be very locked in. We looked at kind of the different market of rollups and saw a lot of vendor lock in initially when we were getting in the space, we really wanted to avoid that because we think that it needs to be decentralized.
00:08:54.984 - 00:09:17.084, Speaker A: But also you need to be flexible if you're having the modular systems. Otherwise, it doesn't make a ton of sense. You just lock people in and you run into the same kind of scaling issues as a monolithic design if you lock people into too many parts of the stack, because it can be modular. But if you're not flexible, we don't see how that makes a ton of sense. So flexibility is a big thing for us.
00:09:17.544 - 00:09:49.340, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just crafting the kind of 2024 outlook just to try and get my thoughts on the page of, like, where I think we're at, and even on the modular section of that. Exactly. Right. In what you were saying, I was looking at Celestia, I was looking at Eigen Da, and there's a couple of others that are coming onto the market. And I was like, I wonder if this becomes kind of like a BD kind of war? And then I was like, oh, Abbott and Orbit have partnered with Celestia. And I was like, let me see if I can.
00:09:49.340 - 00:10:21.784, Speaker B: Leia have partnered with optimism. It looks like they both had these separate announcement, but it feels a bit like. Feels a bit strange, doesn't it? Like, as you say, you'd want to completely leave that flexibility completely open. Obviously, one size doesn't necessarily fit all, even if there could potentially be a commoditized product that one day across the data availability layer. But, yeah, I don't know. These things seem to happen. You get the kind of benefit in the core marketing and association and all that kind of good stuff.
00:10:21.784 - 00:10:29.704, Speaker B: Good to hear that you guys have kind of had the foresight not to kind of box yourself off. And we never know what the end solution is going to be, do we? So good to keep that open.
00:10:30.604 - 00:10:32.944, Speaker A: Still very early. Still. Still early.
00:10:34.404 - 00:10:54.980, Speaker B: There you go. We'll chop that up and put it at the beginning. So. So, yeah, can you. So I had the. I had Cooper from movement labs on recently, and he, like, glanced over snowman consensus, and I was. We were getting to the end of the end of the hour, and I was just like, damn, I wish I'd ask him a little bit more about that.
00:10:54.980 - 00:11:04.064, Speaker B: But what's the beauty of it here? What's the kind of flexibility and how do you kind of foresee you guys using it and the industry kind of adopting it?
00:11:05.044 - 00:11:57.304, Speaker A: Yeah. So the main beauty of it for us is fast finality, because the roll ups typically want a very fast finality time on a sequencer, because otherwise you'll have issues of reorgs. And a reorg is essentially when the history of blocks gets changed. That's the simplest way of looking at a reorg, is we have block one at time one, at block two at time two, and somehow they get switched. Whether there's a double signing or some other issue of blockchain, reorgs can be caused by a variety of different things. So reorgs are kind of the bane of the existence of a lot of these roll ups, because if you have a reorg on the layer one or on the sequencer, you'll have an l two reorg as well, which obviously is, you're going to have a pretty bad experience, because most roll ups right now don't have great protection for Reorgs, because Ethereum doesn't have many reorgs. So that's really one of the big things you have to optimize for as well.
00:11:57.304 - 00:12:25.372, Speaker A: And that's why we like snowmen. Consensus is there's really a low, there's really almost no risk of reorgs. And that's one of their main things. That snome that the developers of SNOM can send to save a lapse built out, is that heavy focus on reliability, which we really loved. And we are also one of the first adopters of their framework, Hyper SDK, which we are actually. This coming soon, we're going to be one of the big contributors on HypersTk. We've actually hired out devs specifically for that.
00:12:25.372 - 00:13:05.094, Speaker A: We're supporting people in the community that we're developing on I breast decant, and they're now joining our team, which we're very excited about. So we're really are really. Core focus is making sure that we get this stuff as reliable as possible, while also making sure that people can use it however they want. We've spoken to people that want to use shared sequencer for rollups, for all different kinds of use cases. We have people that want to do privacy, people that want to do defi, people that want to do gaming, general purpose exchange roll ups, all these different things. So, flexibility is one of the main core tenants behind Nodekit, and that ranges all the way from the app level to the DA level. Do anything in between.
00:13:05.754 - 00:13:30.774, Speaker B: Yeah, that's really cool. I'm gonna have to do a little bit more digging on this, because a lot smarter people than me keep bringing it up. But so what is the. What does the top down kind of architecture of what you guys are building look like? From kind of l one to like to the applications that get built, or the roll ups that got built? Like, what does that kind of. Just so I can kind of picture it in my mind as a. As a bit of an architecture?
00:13:31.314 - 00:14:14.974, Speaker A: Yep. So if you have a roll up, essentially, of a roll up node, like, let's just say of a roll up full node that's submitting transactions to seek the l one, and then seek has basically an API interface on top of it that the roll up is able to communicate with to get back. You've submitted transaction, then you're getting back full blocks essentially. And you're able to use, able to get back the transactions only for that roll up. So you don't have to get back every single roll up transactions because if you did, the blocks would be really big, which wouldn't, wouldn't work as well. So that's how that piece of puzzle kind of works. But one of the main things you also need to do is the roll ups want to have commitments to the state on the L1.
00:14:14.974 - 00:15:07.264, Speaker A: So what we mean by that is there's this thing that we call the orchestrator that's essentially submitting commitments for from a seq block to the Ethereum L1. So in the roll up is able to look at that and derive it. It's essentially similar to celestial blobstream or I believe Avale has Vector X is what their solution is called, I believe essentially very similar to that. And the reason why you need that with a roll up, it's especially important for ZK rollups because they want to be able to prove using a ZK proof that hey, this block actually originated on seeking, which is why we're actually one of the first developers and this is a little alpha for your audience. We're the first developers of zero knowledge proofs of Avalanche warp messaging. And as far as I know, I believe we are first on that. So yeah, that is Avalanche's new primitive that is similar to IBC.
00:15:07.264 - 00:15:53.874, Speaker A: We're developing the first zero knowledge proof version of that which allows us to prove that this block originated on seek from the Ethereum L1 or any other l one that we're posting these commitments to just like blobstream or Vectorx. We're able to essentially prove that on a variety of L1's depending on where customers want to launch roll ups, typically they do want to launch them on the Ethereum L1. That is where we've seen the most rollups launch. But we have had people talk to us about different environments as well. So as we kind of maintain a very flexible viewpoint on that, we're glad to help people deploy these contracts elsewhere and we should be looking forward to that coming out in that feature. Should be available in one of our first testnets as well, which we're very excited about.
00:15:54.534 - 00:16:39.724, Speaker B: Sick. That's really, that's really interesting. And not to kind of go back too closely to the movement labs episode, but kind of like how, how kind of VM agnostic. Could these kind of roll ups be? Is it like, are you guys thinking about the landscape past the EVM? Like, what's your kind of thoughts on that? I've got my own thoughts on SVM, I think being excellent. I think there's been a lot of attention. And like some of the upgrades that happened on Solana have really showed that EVM might be, there might be a next iteration of it. And then obviously with Cooper move filling me weeks back, all I've been thinking about is different iterations on the VM.
00:16:39.724 - 00:16:41.744, Speaker B: Like how are you guys kind of thinking about that?
00:16:42.684 - 00:17:21.184, Speaker A: We're extremely agnostic on VM. The way it works is when you submit a transaction, it's just the transaction data and then a chain id. That's it. So, and that they're both represented as byte arrays, which is a very low level kind of primitive in programming in general, is a byte array. So essentially we can represent transactions from anything, whether it's Ck, WasM, EVM SEM is a little bit different on its own. We haven't had a customer really ask us for that yet. But yeah, we've looked into quite a few different systems and it should be sure work fine, any of them.
00:17:22.564 - 00:18:03.766, Speaker B: So obviously if you, even if you're kind of just part time hobbyists in this space, dipping in and out, the. The expansion of l two s is only going to increase, in my opinion. I think people are figuring out different weird and wonderful use cases for them. There's a big race for like a specific ethereum. L two obviously happening. We're starting to see some innovation on kind of less than fit, less than fair voltage that go into the market with like some maybe ponzi yields or people using them for specific use cases. But the issue obviously comes back to, and we kind of need to take a step back a bit before the expansion happens.
00:18:03.766 - 00:18:22.914, Speaker B: What happens with the interop, the fragmentation, composability across all this, because it's all well and good. Having more l two s than ERC 20 tokens seems like we might get there. But if they're all siloed away and the interop isn't there, like what's the point? So like how do you guys kind of play into this?
00:18:23.834 - 00:19:06.852, Speaker A: That's actually one of our core tenets is we've, we have a solution that we can't share super publicly yet, but we do have a solution for enabling cross rule interop. Building on top of roll ups that are using seek. And that we believe that does really help with the inter rule of composability. And we believe that, and I've actually spoken on panel about this in Turkey, we believe that in general, composable needs to get much simpler. It needs to be able to be done at the wallet level. It needs to be able to be done seamlessly and easily between rollups. And yes, there are different security concerns about abstracting away chains, but still, you can, you can somewhat abstract away some of these pieces of the puzzle.
00:19:06.852 - 00:19:39.084, Speaker A: And we believe that's really a crucial thing for blockchain architecture to scale, especially if app chains are going to scale, you need to be able to abstract away some of these pieces. Otherwise it gets very confusing. Like, you use your same bank account across a bunch of different things, you're using your same credit card across a bunch of different things. And what we see is there does need to be some abstraction, but you also still need to remain extremely safe. So it's that crucial balance, and we have different partners we work with on that as well. And. But we believe crossroad composability is definitely a needed thing.
00:19:39.084 - 00:20:00.504, Speaker A: And interoperability, I'm using interoperability and composability kind of the same way here. The way we view composability is kind of being able to seamlessly transact between different smart contracts across rollups. And we believe that that really should be something that is possible in the near future, and that's something we're working on every day at node gift.
00:20:01.204 - 00:20:43.292, Speaker B: That's really cool. Yeah, I think there's been like this talk for quite some time now, and I think we're finally kind of getting there. And the modular versus monolithic debate is only heating up with, like, the likes of yourselves, like Celestia, the plethora of projects that are coming trying to solve, like the modular stack solution. And then obviously Solana's the kind of the reverse of that, where it's also added to the other zone, and people are kind of seeing the benefits of both. But what's it like from the tech side if you are going to kind of create one of these? I don't know. The first one that comes to mind for me is eclipse. So like SVM Celestia data availability set l two and l two.
00:20:43.292 - 00:21:02.144, Speaker B: And I think they use, I can't remember what the integration they use, but what, is there any trade offs by integrating multiple different kind of third parties to kind of create this kind of Frankenstein chain or megazord chain or whatever it starts to look like versus kind of your monolithic kind of counterparts?
00:21:03.644 - 00:21:58.626, Speaker A: Yes, there is there's always trade offs and stuff like that and different roll ups in general. But one of the main things that I believe the modular space has done really well is allowing flexibility, but also still trying to maintain high performance. And one of the big things that I actually do day in and day out is I'm always reading new articles about different consensus algorithms and new ways of increasing performance, whether that's from Solana, SWE, Aptos or any number of other builders in the space. We think that there is still a major performance paradigm to be reached. And we don't think that blockchains have ended up optimized to their full potential yet. And we believe that, yes, the modular space helps in some aspects, yes, it does hurt in others. But as of anything, you do need the Lego pieces to be able to build out these massive distributed systems.
00:21:58.626 - 00:22:35.564, Speaker A: If everyone had to use the exact same instance of AWS, or the exact same setup on AWS to do everything, it'd be much harder to get people to all build it together. So building essentially a modular that are more. They are more fragmented ecosystems, but allowing interoperability between them, we believe was a good trade off for stuff like that because different people have different requirements for anything. If they didn't, we'd all just program in Java. But we don't. Everybody uses different things. That's a big thing for us, is allowing flexibility, but understanding that, yes, people are going to make trade offs on some things.
00:22:35.564 - 00:23:04.570, Speaker A: Some people want to use DAC, some people want to use DA there. Some people want to use Ethereum for DA, some people want to switch around a little bit. And allowing that flexibility is, we think, a really crucial thing. But yeah, there's trade offs. And I'm not really afraid to say it, it's obviously, there's always going to be trade offs in any system, but it's deciding what's the best solution for you. You can like both. I think that's the big thing people forget is you can like both, you can use both.
00:23:04.570 - 00:23:13.574, Speaker A: It doesn't need to be one or the other. You can. You can use both. You can enjoy both. And that's kind of how we see it, as different things for different people.
00:23:13.954 - 00:23:59.660, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And different use cases as well. I think. I think the space gets so tribal and kind of primitive over like, just like silly things at times. But yeah, there's also like a little bit nuance in the middle that are like the same of any situation, which is kind of hilarious. But what's it like? You'll have a bit of a unique perspective on this, actually. What is the collaboration with other teams like, that are building? Is it very much a general consensus towards building towards a common goal of opening up the modular landscape? Like, how's that kind of been received? Like, what's the initial conversations being like? It helps if everyone's kind of pulling the cart and say, all in the same direction, because everyone's pulling in different directions at different speeds, you're kind of not going to go anywhere.
00:23:59.660 - 00:24:03.064, Speaker B: But is everyone generally collaborative or what's been the experience?
00:24:04.404 - 00:25:01.754, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a lot of collaboration, I would say, in the modular space with different people, kind of all going towards the goal of let's be very modular, while also maintaining high performance and decreasing kind of the cost to launch one of these applications. But you also have to remember, everybody has slightly different goals on different things of this. For example, some people might be optimizing solely for gaming, gaming applications, and some people might be solely optimizing for defi. So obviously, there's different things that people want in this space. But I think that overall, the modular space has a pretty cohesive kind of idea of, okay, we're trying to build rollups to scale theorem and scale application chains in general. And after that, it does get a little bit fuzzy if you look at, like, Cosmos Cosmos roll ups or versus Cosmos app change versus Ethereum roll ups. But at the end of the day, everybody wants to make applications that are cheaper to use, easier to use with.
00:25:01.754 - 00:25:03.914, Speaker A: Interrupt Billy, from the beginning.
00:25:04.534 - 00:25:05.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:05.934 - 00:25:08.550, Speaker A: Yes and no. Like any industry.
00:25:08.742 - 00:25:49.694, Speaker B: Yeah, it makes. It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Because, like, I suppose I keep using Solana because it's obviously the most top mind kind of monolithic chain. But you can imagine coordination to actually work towards a common goal is a little bit more streamlined, if anything. But again, the flexibility is. Now you're kind of a little bit screwed. But, yeah, makes a lot of sense. What's the lift like for applications or l two s that kind of want to integrate your stack is like, how heavy of a lift is it? Would you like to see more built out from you guys before integration gets super simple? How are you guys thinking about that?
00:25:50.314 - 00:26:34.430, Speaker A: Yep. So we're integrating a few different roll up stacks ourselves. We're integrating opstack, as well as a few different other ones, such as Polygon, CDK, Sovereign, SDK, Rolekit. There's a bunch of integrations we've kind of planned out. So the way that we kind of see it on our end is we want to make a lot of these roll up integrations, but we also. There's only so many roll up stacks you can integrate, and we'd much rather have better features and a more streamlined experience for a few of them than try and support every single one of them, which is hard because obviously you want to support as many as possible, but you also have to make sure that you're given the best possible experience to customers. And that's one of the biggest things that we want to do, is get the best possible experience.
00:26:34.430 - 00:27:17.294, Speaker A: So sorry to say we may not be able to support every single stack. We are a smaller team, but we are going to try and support a lot of the main stacks and then also deliver on features such as interop building and better integrations for that interrupt building up potentially, like the wallet level and stuff like that, and different TA integrations, rather than trying to focus on every single roll up integration ever. Because if you do that, the way we kind of see it is we didn't want to end up with a master of none kind of scenario where you can support every single one of them, but if it's only kind of surface level deep, you'll end up just solving bugs for the rest of time. Because every roll up stack has to update eventually. So that's kind of how we see it on our end.
00:27:17.594 - 00:27:39.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I could see you very quickly getting into a situation where you spread extremely thin. Particular of all the innovation that's offered in. Yeah, as you say, there seems to be a little bit of a power law that is happening with the stacks anywhere where people are opting for specific uses, so. But yeah, I'm glad that's a problem that you guys are fixing and not me.
00:27:40.014 - 00:28:25.530, Speaker A: Yeah, well, one of the nice things about that is most roll up stacks do use geth or Reth. So Geth is go Ethereum, the main client, and then Reth is actually rust Ethereum. And that is built by the paradigm team. So that's the nice thing is most roll up stacks, there's some exceptions. Obviously CDK does it a little bit differently, but that was because they were one of the first CK vms. Most of them do stuff a little pretty similarly on some of these levels, so that does help out a bit. But I'm always excited to see new innovations in the roll up space, whether that's with movie vms, svMs, WaSM vms is all interesting to me, and I think that it helps the flexibility on the app level, which is always nice to see.
00:28:25.530 - 00:28:27.442, Speaker A: Gotta build more cool apps.
00:28:27.618 - 00:29:18.454, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. Honestly, I know it's been a bit of a demise since, but, like, forensic, when it first came out, was a bit of like a breath of fresh air. It's like, oh, it isn't the 10th MasterChef Uni V two decks that I've seen come across the desk in quite some time. And I think it kind of sparked a little bit of, oh, yeah, there is stuff beyond the financialization of stuff. And what other interesting apps can we actually build? And I suppose if you want to build an app, truly at scale, like a consumer facing app, like real consumer level, the infrastructure that you guys are providing would be a great use case for it. Is there anything that you guys, even just on a personal level, you'd love to see get built using node kit?
00:29:19.474 - 00:30:11.938, Speaker A: I'd love to see more gaming frameworks adopt shared sequencers. We think that there could be a lot of interoperability between them as well. As we have a unique advantage. We can do permissioned or permissionless deployments, which we had a partnership with Benkei Finance and Benkei ignite just this last, this will be out a couple weeks ago at this point, so. Well, at the time of recording, it came out yesterday, but yeah, so Benkit Ignite allows us to seamlessly deploy both permission and permissionless versions of node get seek, which allows us to have a lot more flexibility at different rollups, because some roll ups actually want a permission version of a decentralized sequencer because of compliance purposes, which that's some of my background is in doing compliance data analytics. So I'm. I understand all the headaches that it can come with, but gotta solve for all these different issues as well.
00:30:11.938 - 00:30:21.054, Speaker A: So I would say the biggest things that we wanna see is gaming applications, defi, and always just social and novel apps as well.
00:30:22.114 - 00:31:14.022, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we're only gonna start to see more of the permission stuff. And I know it's a couple of years back now, but even Aave had like, Aave arc, I think it was called. I don't know how they've rolled out, bundled their new product up, but I spoke to a couple of app specific derivatives products. If anyone's kind of read out or listened to our content, they follow. They might be able to read between the lines. But I think a lot of these people are thinking, well, how do we really tap into the big liquidity? And the big boys who want to come over, they're going to want to know counterparty, and they're going to want to assess counterparty risk before they start throwing serious liquidity around. That is needed for, I don't know, to get an efficient options market or to get an efficient futures market or a purpose market.
00:31:14.022 - 00:31:36.126, Speaker B: So it's coming, whether people like it or not, this thing's happening. And like, it's not as easy as just kind of a way go. There's a permission chain, is it? So it's like, it's really interesting to see. And again, I'm just like you. I just like seeing cool shit get built. Like, you don't, you don't have to go down like a maximalist route if it's not 100% permissionless defi, you know. So, um.
00:31:36.126 - 00:31:38.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we see a lot more of that.
00:31:39.254 - 00:32:11.592, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And I also think we are going to see the rise of Eth or Tia being used for everything in the modular space. And this isn't disclaimer. Now, financial advice. Any opinions on this podcast are of my own, not of anomaly incorporate or node kit. But the way that we kind of see it is rollups are going to want the flexibility. They're going to want the flexibility of saying, hey, I don't need to manage 15 different things just to be able to pay for my transactions.
00:32:11.592 - 00:32:38.934, Speaker A: So that's another. I'll give the audience a little bit of alpha. We're actually allowing rollups. The production version will allow rollups to be able to pay in ETh on the node charge sequencer. Still looking at different security models as well. But that is how transactions will be able to be paid for. And we're also one of the first chains of multi dimensional fee markets, and that is due to the contributions of Ava labs on hyper Esther.
00:32:38.934 - 00:32:50.574, Speaker A: So multidimensional fee markets will essentially allow us to essentially a version of local fee markets so we won't have as much of a noisy neighbor problem, which is nice.
00:32:51.914 - 00:33:49.064, Speaker B: Damn, that is interesting and crucial for options. Yeah, absolutely. I was gonna kind of ask on stuff like that, but I think it became like super. Again, I apologize to keep bringing up, but like, the isolated feed marks on spanner definitely kind of piqued my interest. And I know, like, they had the mad lads mint, which had like some ridiculous number of transactions going through to those specific hotspots. But then they also had the helium migration happening at the same time from its own network to Solana. A few rpcs went down, don't get me wrong, but the priority fee situation where helium migration touching specific points of network wasn't interrupted or wasn't exponentially increased by the model ads that was happening on the opposing end of the network which is completely fascinating.
00:33:49.064 - 00:33:58.584, Speaker B: And I think you guys are one of the first kind of information people I've spoke to that are building in this specific ecosystem that are actually working towards that. So that's really cool.
00:33:59.884 - 00:34:42.116, Speaker A: Thanks. Yeah, we look at a lot of the stuff that the major l one s are kind of doing and think about how we can improve our systems while maintaining, obviously, the modularity and neutrality of seeking. Because the way that we see it is obviously these l one s that got backed with millions and millions of dollars and have some of the best distributed systems engineers in the world. They may have a point on some of these optimizations. I think a lot of people in the modular space throw out some of these ideas and they're like, well, we don't need to be decentralized. We don't need these fast consensus mechanisms. And it's like, we should, we need this, and this should be the default, but somehow it became not the default.
00:34:42.116 - 00:35:36.194, Speaker A: And the way that we kind of view it is, yes, you can learn from other people in the space. It doesn't need to be, oh, we're just moving these vms over into the modular space, and that's as far as we go. You can move different consensus algorithms into the modular space, you can modify these things to work in different manners, and you can make them be as highly performant as possible. And the way that we see it is, yes, some of these optimizations can be applied. And obviously we love the work done by Solana, Suia, Aptos, and all these different large scale projects on consensus research, because we think that moves the entire space forward. And we think overall, we should be decentralized in general for rollups. It shouldn't be a question of, oh, am I going to decentralize or centralize? We should be decentralized in general, because otherwise, what happens when a company goes bankrupt? They just kind of shut down the sequencer.
00:35:39.334 - 00:36:10.278, Speaker B: Yeah, good point. So what, um, so immediately, like, when I'm asking these questions, I'm kind of thinking, new l two s, new apps. What about, like, existing infrastructure, existing apps, existing l two s? Like, what does that world look like? If a, like, hypothetically, you were to kind of start conversations with those guys, is that a mess to kind of rejig? Like, what does it look like? I'm speaking from a completely untechnical level here, so apologies.
00:36:10.406 - 00:36:52.754, Speaker A: Yeah, so it is and it isn't. It's a little bit less messy depending on where the DA is sent and also which roll up integration it's done on. So for example, like on Opstack, it's less messy because Opstack has the batcher and the sequencer, so they're separated, but on different stacks they're done different ways. So I would say basically it depends. Some of them get really messy and really complicated, and you're like, wow, wow, this gets really confusing. Very difficult, but something that's very drop in. And we've also seen some, I've personally seen some crazy work done on the migration of l one style two s and all these different things.
00:36:52.754 - 00:37:36.714, Speaker A: I don't know if you saw and not related, we don't work with them, but just cool tech. I saw online palm network, I believe, was the one they forked from an l one into an l two, which is crazy to see, in my opinion. I think that's just like one of the craziest innovations I've seen yet was being able to fork l one to l two. So I think that a lot of this stuff, obviously it seems complicated at like a service level, but if people are able to do that, it gives me faith that we will definitely be able to essentially reconfigure, rejig all these different l two s that want to be able to use a shared sequencer, it's possible. If we can figure out forking in ten l two, anything's possible.
00:37:38.294 - 00:37:50.034, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. That seems I get a little bit scared. I'm sending a large transaction to one of my other wallets, never mind forking an l one to an f two. So, so that my cause is doing that.
00:37:51.094 - 00:38:24.180, Speaker A: Yeah, that brings up a good point. We do need better wallet infrastructure. I think in the modular world and in crypto in general, it's scary right now. We've had to use gnosisafe before, and even that gets scary to use because it's, oh my gosh, I'm receiving money or I'm paying somebody. How is this all supposed to work? How can I super safe multiple signers double check the address. I really think that there does need to be better solutions, hopefully soon. And that's why I'm happy to see that more consumer based applications are receiving funding as well as infrastructure.
00:38:24.180 - 00:39:21.228, Speaker A: Because hopefully during this next market, in these next few years, we can really get better infrastructure on this stuff. Because it's very difficult. Because if you don't have that core infrastructure that works super well and people just use it freely and they say basically the venmos, the cells of these different things, and being able to say, I'm going to use this, it's going to work the exact way I want it every time and I never have to worry about it. I don't think there's a lot of applications in crypto where you can say that, where it's like this can work every time. I have no concerns ever about using this at all versus when you're using Zelle or Venmo, you see a picture on the other end, you see your friend's face, you see everything there. I think obviously those solutions are centralized and they have their own downsides. But I think trust in crypto applications and more seamless applications is a big way that we can also move the space forward as well as having a modular vision as well.
00:39:21.228 - 00:39:28.144, Speaker A: These aren't things that are separate. You can have both, and I think both need to be improved to kind of move the whole space forward.
00:39:28.764 - 00:40:05.054, Speaker B: Absolutely, 100%. I mean, been banging that drum for a long time now. It feels like we're getting there, though. I don't know if it was the last 18 months, maybe close to two years, where we've had a pretty harsh crypto winter, particularly in the markets. And then people have had time to reassess, regroup. What didn't work last time around, what drastically needs to change UI, Ux, a lot of account abstraction stuff getting funded, a lot of wallet stuff getting funded, um, like in private markets. And you might one day get there.
00:40:05.834 - 00:41:04.176, Speaker A: Yeah, it's looking, it's looking way more likely now, which I'm happy to say, especially now that we're also seeing like bigger organizations using account abstraction on things as well. I saw a few of the different bank partnerships using contraction partners as well, which that's cool to see because then you know that hey, this contraction part company is probably going to get a lot of funding and revenue through these different places as well, and hopefully that can help them sustain for longer. Because I think that's the biggest issue. One of the bigger issues as well, on the consumer side is how to monetize long term, because you can't, as much as everybody in crypto likes to pretend you can't just raise forever, especially for a lot of consumer facing applications. Everybody has to maintain some level of either revenue or other paths to sustainability in crypto. And I think that's one of the biggest things I'm happy to see. And this was happy to see.
00:41:04.176 - 00:41:31.534, Speaker A: Coming out of this bear market is a focus more on sustainability for different applications and different infrastructure players. Because the L1's like the core infrastructure can survive off of different ways as well. But if all the infrastructure on top of you, isn't there? And getting built, you can't really use it. That's why we always say that, like, if nobody can use it, does it really matter if it's the best thing ever? Built needs to be useful.
00:41:32.474 - 00:41:50.434, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, there's always that. Even towards the end of the last cycle, it was like, oh, profitable crypto applications. It's like, is there any. I know there's a few that. There's a few that have kind of like Brentuck. Yeah, I think half of that got sent to coinbase the other day, didn't it?
00:41:51.294 - 00:41:55.598, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I must have missed that one. It's been a busy past few days here, but yeah.
00:41:55.686 - 00:42:41.714, Speaker B: Yeah, well, GMX was kind of the darling of the bear market, really. Like that was getting sustainable revenues, obviously coming from quite, quite high fees for a purpose and stuff like that. But like, sustainable to the point where it was like, that's actually really cool. What I don't like seeing, like, exactly what you've touched upon. Like, there's one thing continually raising and there's another thing just solely relying on an extremely low float for like a ridiculous number of years and just like inflating everyone's kind of value where. And getting high on like ridiculous kind of token distributions and stuff like that all comes out in the wash as well. And I think there's going to be a lot of projects that.
00:42:41.714 - 00:43:03.178, Speaker B: I think there's going to be a lot of token v two s this year. I actually included this in. I think there's going to be a lot of people think, shit. We're running to the end of our mission schedule. We might need to. There's actually a, there's actually a big l one in the space going through this now. But yeah, I think that might look at it in like rejigger around.
00:43:03.178 - 00:43:11.814, Speaker B: So we might need a little bit of utility and extra couple of tokens, but, yeah, can't get high on your own supply for too long because it all comes back to roost.
00:43:12.554 - 00:43:35.828, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting to see it all play out. I think we're finally seeing kind of. Okay, you work good in a bull market. How do you maintain long term? Because there's kind of like, the, people like to call it Boomer defi. Like the initial defi stuff that came around. The initial l ones came around and now it's like, okay, you did good back then. You kind of fell off a bit.
00:43:35.828 - 00:44:01.684, Speaker A: What's happening now? And we're starting to see different l one s and l come back as l, two s or do different things or specialize in different manners, which I think is good. It shows the industry is starting to mature more. And then we're not just having these just die off into the abyss. They're figuring out what to do, how to fit, how to get product market fit, and really how they fit in this new markets landscape that's always shifting, as we all know.
00:44:02.384 - 00:44:40.744, Speaker B: Yeah, and I kind of like it and I kind of respect like, Polygon get a lot of shit for like, seemingly edging their way into every, like, emerging narrative. But like, if you're a traditional, like, fintech startup, you're gonna like, adapt and change as new information is presented to you. And I, I kind of get it. I kind of be doing the same thing. Like, you can't just set out with like, imagine like ethereum's initial kind of go to market like that. No one, no one said that they were going to have everything figured out. They still don't have everything figured out and it's going to be a long time, so they actually do.
00:44:40.744 - 00:45:01.852, Speaker B: But it just, it's just strange to me that people are like, oh, they're just kind of trying to leech on scenarios and stuff. Like, oh, it's just like, no, like, if you're a company, you need to pivot to what's where. You think, like, the industry's moving and you want to be a part of it. And it doesn't necessarily mean you don't have your shit together. It's just like any normal company. Just because inside this industry sometimes it gets a lot better flak and you're.
00:45:01.868 - 00:45:13.824, Speaker A: Always learning new information and to touch on, like, fintech, trying new things. Like, people seem to forget that you can use stripe for everything from credit card processing to filing an LLC.
00:45:14.984 - 00:45:15.928, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:45:16.096 - 00:45:21.724, Speaker A: So, yeah, same site for everything.
00:45:22.584 - 00:46:08.584, Speaker B: Yeah, it's absolutely mental. One of the big kind of dyno Defi projects was another one where we were just saying, like, sustainability and like, with makerdao and obviously throughout the bear market, like, ridiculous amount of their treasury satin t bills and money printed machine. And like, again, they'd, they're initially a CDP backed by ETh. And then like, as I say, like, new opportunities arise. You hit a point in time where interest rates are ridiculous. So it's like, well, we need to tap into that. Like, we need to survive and we need to, and obviously extremely profitable off the back of it.
00:46:09.124 - 00:47:00.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that that's looking like it was a pretty good move on their part. So I think that they've done a pretty good job on sustainability and they're one of the main, like big DeFi projects that has done a great job on it. And I think that's how you get like a long term adoption on this stuff is being able to figure out sustainability and figure out all these different issues of lending because some people got blown up. Whether there was some stuff in real estate that had some issues when the real estate market changed around. Having that flexibility to move into different markets, just because you're one thing doesn't mean you can't move into different markets. Obviously there's some markets you can't move into, but some you can. So having the flexibility and having the nimbleness in crypto is always something that I think is needed for a lot more projects and typically follow that.
00:47:00.260 - 00:47:05.424, Speaker A: You need to be nimble, you need to be able to move quickly because otherwise you can kind of get left behind.
00:47:05.924 - 00:47:15.984, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. What can you tell us about the raise? Recently gone through a raise. How was that experience? What's the partners been like? What's the VC's been like?
00:47:16.684 - 00:47:36.072, Speaker A: Oh, it was great. We raised 1.2 million led by borderless capital with participation from Polygon Ventures, Blizzard, as well as the wormhole cross chain ecosystem fund and a few different angels as well. It was a great process. It took a few months. We're young, we're called dropouts. So that was definitely tricky.
00:47:36.072 - 00:47:59.146, Speaker A: We are dropouts from Iowa State University. Me and Nick dropped out from Iowa State. I was in my junior year, Nick was a senior, and then Ricardo dropped out from Wisconsin Madison, he was a junior as well. So it was definitely a tricky process raising. But overall it wasn't too terrible. The biggest thing is you have to find a lead, which is very tough in this market. But yeah, that was kind of how our race went.
00:47:59.146 - 00:48:35.934, Speaker A: It was pretty good. We also went and we were down and we did this thing called the lbank bootcamp for kind of student builders that really helped out a lot as well because we were able to kind of get prepared, meet VC's, get feedback on our idea. So I definitely encourage people to do stuff like that and get resources and really take advantage of resources, especially as students. There's a lot more resources out there for student founders than they think most people will take your call. The biggest thing I did was I said yes to everything for around six or seven months. Just take every call. And people think that's kind of crazy and they're like, oh, that doesn't work.
00:48:35.934 - 00:49:03.904, Speaker A: Like whenever I talk to people in Iowa, about how we raised our run. They'd say, like, oh, that doesn't work. Like, you just took every call, and it's like, yeah, I would go on 30 calls a week, and at a certain point in time, you figure it out. That was just how it was for us, at least. I know it's a very difficult market to raise in, but biggest thing I would encourage is just put yourself out there and take all these calls, say all these introductions. You never know where it's going to go. And that's kind of how it all led to all of this.
00:49:05.084 - 00:49:33.756, Speaker B: I think that's great advice. And it's kind of just becomes like a game of numbers. And if you're not putting in the reps, you're never going to be able to find you in that pitch. And you never know who, as you say, even if someone isn't going in on the round just by being able to have those, cut, that contact, that initial conversation, you never know what, what the hell's gonna happen further down the line. Like, absolutely, you have no idea what's gonna happen. So, yeah, I always don't get that. I don't get, there's been a few projects where we've been initially interested in.
00:49:33.756 - 00:49:39.064, Speaker B: Like, unless there's been a soft commit, they don't want to have a call. I'm like, who the hell are you guys?
00:49:40.924 - 00:50:24.864, Speaker A: On integration partners as well? I think the way that we kind of see it is like nobody's hit product market fit in crypto. Somebody wants to use your tech or invest, you should take the call. Even if, even if you're thinking, oh, maybe not, just take the call, figure it out. Because I've actually met more customers and stuff, I would say because you meet all these different VC's, you meet so many people, even when they say no, because they meet you and they say, oh my gosh, I love this guy, I love this girl. They're so great, they're so smart. I want to introduce them to all my friends, and they all have big group chats, they all talk to each other. So we had a few that we met, like one person, and then we'd meet like six or seven different VC funds out of it, and then we'd meet like three or four out of that.
00:50:24.864 - 00:51:05.376, Speaker A: And you grow your network exponentially quicker than it, than if you try and shoot for the perfect vc and shoot for, like, if you're trying to build the perfect round and trying to shoot for perfection, that's always much more difficult than take a lot of calls, and at some point good VC's will notice you, good investors will notice you, and you'll get in touch with them. But the biggest thing is you can't be picky. As a founder trying to raise, you need to just. It's a game of numbers. Once you hit a certain inflection point, you're going to know a lot of people and that helps out a lot. It's been one of the. I would say that's like the, that's the thing that propelled us.
00:51:05.376 - 00:51:25.284, Speaker A: The strongest at Nokit, obviously, the tech as well. But our unwavering commitment to take as many calls as possible, meet as many people, and just put ourselves out there has helped us get enshrined and involved in this industry as quickly as possible. Starting from people that really didn't know anybody and went to non target schools.
00:51:25.744 - 00:51:48.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's so important, particularly for the kind of, kind of product you guys have as well. Like going forward, it's going to be a lot of conversations, a lot of kind of bd, a lot of this is why we're the right kind of solution for you guys. So, yeah, a lot of people think it's just build it and they'll come and it's. Man, not at all. If you're competing against those guys, you're in a very good position, I think.
00:51:48.864 - 00:52:08.984, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Building they will come has always been tricky because, like, I've tried that before in other startups. It doesn't work and we've definitely not tried it here. You need to get stuff out there, you need to get people using it, and you need to get that feedback loop going quickly. Otherwise you're just moving nowhere.
00:52:09.404 - 00:52:28.074, Speaker B: No, 100% like. And sometimes you need that kind of candid feedback. Sometimes you don't actually want to hear. Maybe you thought about it deep in the back of your mind sometimes, but. So what's, kind of what stage of the rollout you're on, like where you guys are currently? Like, what's, what can we expect in the next? That's all, I suppose, short to medium time.
00:52:28.734 - 00:52:43.950, Speaker A: Yep. So we're having a Devnet come out in the next couple of weeks, and then we're going to have a testnet. We'll be onboarding validators for that. And that'll happen in q one. So that's kind of the short term. And then we do have a few different announcements. We're going to have a few different roll up integrations come out that people can try out.
00:52:43.950 - 00:53:12.980, Speaker A: So that'll be very exciting. A lot of stuff happening in q one. In general, different DA integrations, whole lot of different stuff coming out. And we're also hiring. We are hiring. So if anybody's interested to work on building the next generation of rollups, we are currently hiring and we're looking for developers in networking and cryptography basically building out seek itself. So that's kind of the current roadmap as well as we also have the zero knowledge proofs of avalanche warp messaging that we're working on as well.
00:53:12.980 - 00:53:33.344, Speaker A: So a few different things going on, but overall the core vision is just getting roll ups to be as easy to use as possible while maintaining decentralization and integrating it into a few of these different existing stacks is really core stuff. And we also do have some community stuff that should be getting announced in the next couple of weeks as well. So stay tuned for that.
00:53:35.364 - 00:53:55.894, Speaker B: So who just is like a final one, who would, who's the net getting cast out to here? Like, who would you really like to start these early discussions as you go into Devnet for applications roll ups? Anyone and everyone? Is there anyone in the specific that you'd like to start bringing conversations with?
00:53:56.914 - 00:54:36.452, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a big focus on dapp developers and figuring out what they really want in app chains and figuring out what their needs are. So obviously those roll up frameworks and also existing rollups as well, so it's a pretty wide net. Also gaming developers as well. We've had interest from gaming studios to use decentralized sequencers and shared sequencers, so we'd love to talk to more of them. So it's a pretty wide net. But the main thing for us is maintaining compostability and flexibility of a lot of these different applications, da layers and rollups in general. So pretty wide net for node kit.
00:54:36.452 - 00:54:44.004, Speaker A: But if you want to use our tech, we are glad to talk. So never going to turn down a customer.
00:54:44.944 - 00:55:24.574, Speaker B: Well Noah, thanks so much for your time. I'll just try and include as much info in the description if anyone's listening as possible, and if you are a builder or you are looking for any of those roles that node kit have currently got available, then I'll leave Noah's info below as well. But yeah, that was great. I think I got all the stuff that I needed to, as I say selfishly ask out of you. So I look forward to seeing what you guys pull out in the future. Again, I say this to all guys, but open invite, you guys are pushing stuff out. Shoot me a message, let's do it again because I'm sure it looks a hell of a lot different in twelve months time for what it looks now.
00:55:25.914 - 00:55:32.254, Speaker A: Thanks for having me on today. It was great talking about all this stuff and going into the entire modular space and crypto as a whole.
00:55:32.554 - 00:55:47.914, Speaker B: Yeah, awesome, right? Thanks a lot everyone. As you say, I still see those 80% on YouTube analytics and subscribe who watch regularly. I will hunt you down if you don't subscribe. Do me a favor, just press subscribe. Right. Take it easy. See you next time.
