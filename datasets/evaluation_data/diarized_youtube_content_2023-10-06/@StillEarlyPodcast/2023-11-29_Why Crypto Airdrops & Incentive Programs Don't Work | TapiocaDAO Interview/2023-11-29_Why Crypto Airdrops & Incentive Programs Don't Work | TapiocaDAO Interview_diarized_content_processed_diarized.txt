00:00:00.200 - 00:00:44.884, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, so, obviously, like, you know, we're. We were just talking about, you know, the need for crossing interoperability, you know, and how far that issue and how dire that issue has become. And Tapioca is really about solving many of the. Of the largest problems in DeFi. I actually think economically, the problem with DeFi is probably. Probably larger than the. Than the cross chain problem or the fragmentation problem, just because what we've been doing with liquidity mining is so nonsensical, it's so counterproductive, it's so negative some that it.
00:00:44.884 - 00:00:51.900, Speaker A: No matter really how great of a protocol you may release or whatever, you're going to continually see failure jam.
00:00:51.932 - 00:01:21.568, Speaker B: So just a quick one before we get started. So, still early is a podcast for educational and informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Any investment decision you should make should be based on your own research and your own understanding of the risks involved. So, yeah, that's it from me. Let's get on with the show. We've got El Jefe, El presidente, creator of socks, the freer of palsy, Matt from Tapioca. Welcome.
00:01:21.568 - 00:01:22.464, Speaker B: How are you doing?
00:01:22.624 - 00:01:38.004, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. Gm. Gm. Yeah, no, I think I'm also now the CEO, according to airdrop farmers. So, El Jefe, CEO, sock man, a number of titles. A number of titles.
00:01:41.264 - 00:01:48.372, Speaker B: What's been going on your side? I don't think we've spoke on the phone or even on a podcast or anything for quite a couple of weeks now, so.
00:01:48.468 - 00:01:48.652, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:48.668 - 00:01:49.556, Speaker B: Have you been.
00:01:49.740 - 00:01:55.184, Speaker A: Yeah, no. Great. Great. Yeah, we're. We're getting. We're getting ready for Genesis here. We're really excited.
00:01:55.184 - 00:02:10.988, Speaker A: You know, the. The puzzle pieces have been arranged, that they're all in place, you know, getting ready to go here. So that's been great. You know, just. Just kind of. Just kind of hitting. You know, hitting the fever pitch here, getting it.
00:02:10.988 - 00:02:29.968, Speaker A: Getting into the. Getting into the final gear on the racetrack. You know, it's really exciting for us just because, I mean, a lot of people know this, but, you know, this. This endeavor started two years ago on. On. In February 2022. So it's been a long time coming.
00:02:29.968 - 00:03:02.874, Speaker A: A lot of code. 14,000 just in solidity. 30,000 altogether. No blueprint, nothing to copy off. Just all brand new. So really excited about that, of just releasing something that people can finally get around, something that's new and just completely different that I think offers a lot of features that people will want. So, yeah, I mean, it's definitely just a big weight off all of our shoulders.
00:03:02.874 - 00:03:07.554, Speaker A: We've been building this thing up, lugging it around and it's fine. Finally come into fruition.
00:03:07.634 - 00:03:13.202, Speaker B: So, yeah, nothing good worth having comes easy, does it? So, um, no, it doesn't.
00:03:13.258 - 00:03:14.294, Speaker A: No, it doesn't.
00:03:14.994 - 00:04:01.690, Speaker B: We just say before, uh, before we hit record, could have been just as easy just to be a serial falker, an anonymous serial falker who actually looks after ten projects at once. But uh, no, we also both saying that wouldn't be in, in the team's nature, would it? It's just like, you guys want to build something that's novel and unique and kind of put the industry on the right track. And I think we're all waiting and in anticipation to see this thing go live. And it's, you know what the funny thing about it is, obviously we want to see it go live because, you know, you guys have been working on for so long, but the amount of times where I just need to use that specific instance of a product and I just can't be, can't be bothered to actually go and do half of this shit manually and I'm just not messing around with it. I'm just going to wait.
00:04:01.832 - 00:04:54.554, Speaker A: Um, no, I mean literally, um, gray was telling me he, he was trying to uh, leverage up sigh and he was like going on, he was bridging to ethereum and then he was like, you know, buy and die. Then he was depositing invest I, and then he was like manually looping like on Aave where you like, you borrow, then you borrow again, you borrow again, blah, blah, blah. And he just was like, man, I couldn't even finish it. And I was like, yeah, like, you know, that's, and that's just one, and that's just one thing. Like, not to mention like there's been times where I'm checking out like some of these new networks and like I think like mantle, I was just checking out or in scroll, you know, it's like I have to like go to this weird stable coin wrapper and then I got to go over here and it's just like, screw it, I'll just wait.
00:04:56.064 - 00:05:26.458, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually a good point. I didn't even think to bring soap. But what do you make of all this? You know, you're seeing kind of even a single stablecoin product get fragmented across different bridging providers and stuff like that. I think we've seen it recently with everyone wants to be the provider of wrapstick teeth. So like, what's your take on that? Because you see an Axla USDC. You're probably going to see a few other iterations. You've got kind of circle CCTP and.
00:05:26.458 - 00:05:40.422, Speaker B: And it's just like, not only do we fragment stuff across different protocols and different change, it's now like the assets in and of themselves begin to get fragmented because people want monopolies over there, bridge in and out. It's crazy, honestly.
00:05:40.598 - 00:06:18.314, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's like. So there was two problems of why I was so, like, cross chain, cross chain when we first started this, you know, again, back in 2022 was number one. You know, I knew L2s would be proliferated, meaning everyone would have a L2. There'd be app chain, L2s. There'd be like, weird, like Solana VM roll ups, like eclipse. I knew there would be hundreds and hundreds of L2s. So you first have that fragmentation, let alone all of the l one's, like an avalanche, Solana, ethereum itself, etcetera.
00:06:18.314 - 00:06:44.066, Speaker A: Um, you know, so you have that problem already. Then you have the. The bridging fragmentation, where you have, you know, you had rather multi chain, then you had, um. Now you have Axlr, you have layer zero, you have, or rather Stargate. Um, you know, you have all of these freaking, um. I'm trying to think of a few more router, you know, umas across. You have all of the.
00:06:44.066 - 00:07:26.244, Speaker A: And it's just all fragmented. And now, like, when you have, like, a rap state teeth, it's like, okay, now I need liquidity pools for all these wrappers. And, you know, how do I get back to native? Oh, there's no liquidity pool. It's like the same issue we had back in 2020 when, like, BNB chain and stuff came out, but made even worse because everyone in town has a solution. And why I felt layer zero was the answer, and even more so is the answer now and will become the de facto answer. In my opinion, now is over. Even a Ccip is freedom of choice.
00:07:26.244 - 00:08:08.698, Speaker A: Obviously, we've seen every single monolithic bridge fail, and different providers want different things. Like Uniswap showed they want a specific way to control their own canonical bridging services or cross chain services. Lido wants their own. Aave is going to want their own, synthetix is going to want their own, tapioca wants their own. So you're only able to do that with layer zero. And the level of customability that's out now is only like one 10th of what you're going to be able to do in the future with. With like a layer zero, I think.
00:08:08.698 - 00:09:08.408, Speaker A: Anyway, you know, we see all of these verifiers like Google Cloud just hit. You have ZK proofs from polyhedra, you have project essence, which means you can spin your own verifier up. I mean, you literally, you could use chain link, you could use whatever you want. So that kind of allows us to have one standard with many, many different implementations of that standard. So we all use like ofts, omnichain fungible tokens. But how the oft is transferred chain to chain is up to us as protocols, which I think is the best solution possible. And I think that's why like a rapstake these, when it went with, when layer zero deployed there, oft, it became so dominant and that the other bridges were crying is because they know it's better tech and they can't compete on the tech layer, they can only compete socially.
00:09:08.408 - 00:09:18.484, Speaker A: So that's what they're trying to do. But nonetheless. Long answer, but yeah, that's kind of the full, full thoughts there.
00:09:19.584 - 00:09:22.136, Speaker B: Fragmentation on fragmentation on fragmentation.
00:09:22.320 - 00:09:25.604, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Too long didn't read. Exactly.
00:09:27.344 - 00:10:03.286, Speaker B: So I've mentioned this a million times. I'm not just saying it because you're here. The death of liquidity mine in part one, which I didn't know was a part one at the time, because you've obviously just recently released part two. There's few pieces and there's a few pieces of content that I really have a strong memory of actually reading the first time around. And that was one of them. And primarily, primarily the options, the idea behind options token was like, oh shit, that makes so much sense to me. But you've recently, you've recently did part two.
00:10:03.286 - 00:10:13.846, Speaker B: Yeah, but before we. Before I want to pick a few parts of that apart, can you kind of give people a recap of part one and some of the tidbits in there and we can, we can segue into part two as well.
00:10:14.030 - 00:11:18.304, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, so obviously, like, you know, we're, we were just talking about, you know, the need for crossing interoperability, you know, and how far that issue and how dire that issue has become. And tapioca is really about solving many of the, of the largest problems in DeFi. I actually think economically, the problem with DeFi is probably larger than the, than the cross chain problem or the fragmentation problem. Just because what we've been doing with liquidity mining is so nonsensical, it's so counterproductive, it's so negative some that it, no matter really how great of a protocol you may release or whatever, you're going to continually see failure. So that's why we really started focusing on that. And then I really just released my research piece with it. There was always supposed to be three parts.
00:11:18.304 - 00:12:08.554, Speaker A: There probably won't be a third, maybe, I'm not sure yet. But basically in the first piece, what I described was kind of the history, like how we got here. Like, IDEX started liquidity mining in 2017. Then FCoin, which was a centralized exchange, did trans fee mining where people would pay fees on, in bitcoin and ETH in trading fees on the centralized exchange, and then they would be repaid in FT tokens. Not ftt, but ft at the time. And funnily enough, that Ft went insolvent from the exchange using customer funds to hold the price of the token up. Foreshadowing, right.
00:12:08.554 - 00:12:58.736, Speaker A: But yeah, I mean, then we kind of went to, then we went to basically synthetix with the staking rewards contract, which was actually built by one inch, the founder of one inch. You know, then you kind of go to MasterChef, which sushi created to vampire attack uniswap. And then I think kind of we ended up with yam, where they kind of borrowed the rebasing mechanic from ampleforth and like, pool one staking. And then that was kind of taken to another level with Olympus. And so that first piece was kind of to describe all of that in great detail, but. And why all of them failed in their own ways and then kind of start sprinkling. Okay, well, where.
00:12:58.736 - 00:13:25.764, Speaker A: Why is this model not working and where could we take it to work? And I just kind of vaguely described the o token model, which was started by Andre Crony, kind of left to the wayside with keeper network and then us kind of bringing it back. And the crazy thing is, after that piece was released, 20 protocols have done their own o tokens. 20.
00:13:26.864 - 00:13:28.724, Speaker B: Is that a bit sweet for you?
00:13:29.074 - 00:14:30.924, Speaker A: Um, well, you know, so, of course, when I, when it first started happening, I was like, you know, I was angry about it to some degree. Like, oh, these guys are copying me. Why is that? But, you know, after thinking that way for a little bit, I quickly kind of pivoted to going, okay, you know, they're like, let's think of like, mitch from curve. Every protocol is a ve token today. Is that bad? Well, I don't necessarily think so because every time you use a ve token, you know, that that was curved, that propagated that entire model. So now I kind of look at, I released a freaking mirror article and I have 20 protocols that are basically showing that we created the model forward. And, you know, kind of basically, you know, every time someone uses one of those o tokens, they know tapioca brought this back, tapioca iterated it and that's who it's from.
00:14:30.924 - 00:15:01.218, Speaker A: So it's kind of a stamp of approval on our idea and our thesis that this is where things could go. And also it's been great to be able to look at how they failed, which namely the biggest problem with 99% of them is they're not really call options. But that's besides the point. You know, they definitely tried their best, but, um, you know, I think it just really proved, again, like just what we were doing was the right path. And a lot of people obviously agreed with that.
00:15:01.266 - 00:15:27.254, Speaker B: So it's kind of, it's kind of, it's kind of great way to think about it. Like if people are trying to. I'm not going to say that they're purposely trying to front run any, the idea or anything. Maybe they are. But, um, you, you do get to see it in a live production environment and then take any of the learnings from that without putting any damage on to tap itself. It's like, like have at it.
00:15:27.714 - 00:16:24.610, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. But yeah, and then, and then just to finish that off. So the second part of death liquidity mining was to really go in depth on like, what is the goal of this model and more. So take a look at, I think, three things, which the first is, is the call options aren't really the reason why we think we've made a better model. The reason we think we've made a better model is really twaml, which is time weighted average magnitude lock. Because the whole problem comes down to basically what is the correct reward for the market at the current time to continue growing, but without growing to a point where you're harming yourself. Meaning like compound grew their TVL 600% when they started liquidity mining.
00:16:24.610 - 00:17:38.390, Speaker A: But the problem with that is they brought in, they expended $400 million in comp in the one year time span and they only brought in 45 million in fees. So you kind of have to. So you have a ten to one ratio there. So a lot of times you have to look at are we incentivizing the right thing? That is like with what compounds doing is they're incentivizing what is actually a negative feedback loop because they're basically incentivizing people to deposit as many tokens as possible to then farm and dump the comp rewards and then to withdraw as soon as the comp token loses enough value. So they're literally incentivizing people to act as parasites and just suck all the value they can out and leave. So it's actually completely paradoxical to what they want to do. So that was one of the first things is like, what is tapioca trying to obtain here? And the goal basically is to obtain protocol and liquidity, but also what I sometimes call real TVL.
00:17:38.390 - 00:18:32.006, Speaker A: As far as TVL that's actually locked and that actually has estimable value because once you have actual locked capital, like I have a line in there that says, like if I said I give you a million dollars for 10 seconds, or I'd give you 100 grand for a year, you'd probably take the ladder. And that shows that money isn't just money, it's time and money that matters. Like how long do you have access to that money? So basically if we have a year lock of 100 grand, well we know how much we can extract from that and fees of, you know, borrowers on the platform and everything like that. So it really comes down to a more nuanced approach that we don't care about TVL. We're trying to get locked liquidity, and then we're also trying to get protocol on liquidity. So that was kind of one of the big things. The second, like I was saying, is that the call options aren't the sole solution.
00:18:32.006 - 00:19:39.558, Speaker A: It's twaMl as far as the system that AML is basically measuring the locks, like against where so all the users control the AML measuring stick that basically measures new locks and what the reward should be to them. So like every time you have a new lock, AML goes up and then you have to lock longer and longer to get higher rewards. And then if locks start ending and nobody's relocking, then AML start to decaying so that basically, then we can keep growing. So its basically just continually incentivizing growth, which is the goal. Because on the flip side, if you just give a call option with a 50% discount, then its just like liquidity mining with more steps because youre requiring the person to settle the call option, everything like that. And then its like youre just giving everyone 50% anyway. So theres a lot of nuance in it that I think the part two basically entails of to explain to people how it's a lot more than just, okay, it's a call option and that makes everything great.
00:19:39.558 - 00:19:40.874, Speaker A: Now all of a sudden.
00:19:42.534 - 00:20:11.374, Speaker B: Yeah, I spoke to a like we'll speak to tens of protocols every single week and the amount of people that are tapping into options, options, tokens. But then it's, I have to, I have to just say to them, I was like, but the other aspect is the ML as well. And they were like, yeah, we're just going to do like 50% discount. I was like, have you like really fought this through? Because you can't really have one without the other. It just starts to look like an OHM fork without the rebase.
00:20:11.534 - 00:20:31.104, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly my point is a lot of people just go, okay, there's no token. Wonderful. It's a 50% discount. Okay? And that's not really the case. That what makes, what makes OTAP so great is it's a variable discount. And actually the discount can be 0%. It goes from zero to 50.
00:20:31.104 - 00:21:23.862, Speaker A: So it comes down to appraising those locks. And it's like, okay, if the, let's say the average lock is two years top of a bull run, everyone's locking as far as they can to get as much otap as they can. Well, if I come in here and I'm going to lock, you know, $1,000 for a week, then I'm going to get a 0% discount because my lock has no value to the tapioca protocol when it can get these huge locks all day long. So that's really where the secret sauce is versus just a call option. Because again, call options have a lot of problems too. As far as the user needs to settle the options within the expiration. There's redeeming, there's, you know, settling it to ETh or USDC or whatever when you're done, like, you have a lot of steps involved here.
00:21:23.862 - 00:22:04.044, Speaker A: And it's like if I give you, like, it's just like I always give this like example where it's like if I give you like a $10 bill versus I give you, you know, a call option that gets you, and I give you two call options that gives you $5 apiece, then we're still at the same thing. Like, you know what I mean? You've done the same exact thing. So a lot of people think this is the solution to all their problems are very much mistaken because it's useless by itself. And it actually could, as I was just saying, can create more problems ux wise from people needing to have all these extra steps.
00:22:05.104 - 00:22:40.730, Speaker B: What? So like, let's in, in that example there, two years, let's say you've locked like a million dollars two years and there's a 50%, there's a 50% discount at that current time. What's the user process and user journey going to be like to actually redeem the tap at that discount? Like what? Like let's say it was a Monday and I've locked a million dollars for two years. Like, what's the next steps there? Like, what actually happens to, I receive all tap in the wallet and then I have to redeem it? And when can I redeem it? And like, how does that whole process work?
00:22:40.872 - 00:23:24.324, Speaker A: Yeah, this is where it's gonna suck up front. So basically if you lock for a year, you're going to get 52 distributions of OTap each weekly epoch. And basically you do what's essentially an OTC buy over the counter, buy from the dow at your strike price. So if your strike price is a buck, you know, you buy your, your tap at a dollar directly from the dow. That's how we create the protocol on liquidity. And then basically once that's completed, then you have basically two options. You could sell the tap to realize the profit, or you could hold it or you could lock it in the TW tap to get USDO rewards.
00:23:24.324 - 00:23:56.824, Speaker A: So based on the fees. So that obviously is not great because you're going to have to literally settle these in every 52 weeks. Every week for 52 weeks. You're going to have to know what's the current market price of tap. So, you know, because the mark, the strike price is fixed, whereas the market price obviously can do whatever it wants. So if your strike price is at a buck and tap, let's say, is at $2, but maybe it's dropping and now it's a buck 25. Like you have to be able to look at that.
00:23:56.824 - 00:24:28.612, Speaker A: So that's why we're going to introduce a sub protocol. Probably the first thing we're going to build after Genesis will be TW pro. That's going to do a lot of stuff. But the first thing it's going to do is automated settlement. So you could just transfer your, your locked lending position over the TW Pro and then it'll automatically settle it for you. No capital needed, nothing. It'll use flash mints, settle the, settle the options for you.
00:24:28.612 - 00:25:09.378, Speaker A: You can pick strategies to settle it to eth, settle it to tap. You can have it settle to tap and then lock it automatically for you. Like basically all these powerful automation steps. This will also be white, labeled, kind of like an Olympus pro where other protocols can come and create their own AML and have their own o token and have their own automation, everything like that. It's also going to have where you can liquidate a lot, a lock position with a dutch auction. You can trade your lock positions like, you know, all this type of stuff. There's a few other features I don't want to mention yet, but.
00:25:09.378 - 00:25:52.470, Speaker A: And we're going to have some launch partners with as well who are going to do some o tokens and they're really heavy hitters, which is great. But yeah, I'm really excited for that because that's going to fix the UX issue of the o token and one last little piece of alpha too. It's not just going to settle all the options upfront, it's actually going to act kind of like a to maximize your yield. So it's actually going to use a pricing algorithm to settle your options throughout the week when it's as profitable as possible to do so. Maybe black skulls, I can't really talk about too much, but that's basically going to be the first protocol we put out after today. Abioca.
00:25:52.502 - 00:26:41.994, Speaker B: So nice. So like in theory I could be, let's say I just wanted to compound as much tap as physically possible and just continually lock. I could be claim redeem my option at the highest point based on, I don't know, whatever black scrolls model or whatever is implemented on TW Pro and then auto convert to tarpon auto lock for whatever TWML is at that precarious. Or if you have been a bit of a leech, redeem if it's in the money. If it's redeem if it's in the money to ETH and then do whatever you want to do with the ETH? Like could you do that and then set it to not redeem if it's out of the money. Could you sell out the money calls if you felt like there's a big catalyst coming up? I suppose time duration be a little bit short.
00:26:42.774 - 00:27:48.236, Speaker A: So right now for out of the money calls, we're just going to let them expire. Because the thing is, is they roll over to the next epoch and that's how we extend out the length of the incentive model is because every time an option goes unredeemed, it just keeps rolling over, rolling over, rolling over. So instead of six years, which by the way is like about five times the amount of length of a normal defi protocol these days, like you always see, Prisma is going to shoot out 60% of supply in a year, whereas this is defined to do six years. If there was 100% redemption every epoch, which is basically impossible. But so basically that's supposed to just go unredeemed. The big thing and the final update to the token economy will be based on defending the price floor more because basically call options, what they do is they create a price for, due to the strike price. Like the lowest strike price is basically the price floor of tap.
00:27:48.236 - 00:28:23.552, Speaker A: Because once it, once tap goes lower than that, your options are all out of the money. So basically that's kind of the final piece of the puzzle is once there's enough pull, we can establish a liquid backing of tap. Well, rather an on demand liquidity at the, at the price floor. That's all I could say. That's also a little piece of alpha for the blockmates listeners as well, that that's going to come in. I think it's absolutely freaking revolutionary. This will be copied ad nauseam even more than probably my other ideas.
00:28:23.608 - 00:28:29.804, Speaker B: But yeah, you're not gonna have DCF coming in and trying to rfp it back to.
00:28:32.624 - 00:29:11.304, Speaker A: No, he has enough tap already. But yeah, but yeah. So basically anytime a user wants, they could, they could get on demand liquidity with their tap at that floor price. So if the floor is a buck, you could get on demand liquidity at that dollar, which I think is powerful. And there'll be more info on that. But basically. But basically, yeah, I mean I think the, the model is structured so far beyond anything that's been done in Defi, that it's actually, it's actually pretty, pretty insane.
00:29:11.304 - 00:29:21.804, Speaker A: Just when I think about comparing this to like what else is out there. It's like little Pikes cars versus like a Bugatti. It's almost comical.
00:29:24.304 - 00:29:33.800, Speaker B: I even seen there was a provider that is providing options token infrastructure. I can't remember the name and I don't know if I forgot to send it to you.
00:29:33.832 - 00:29:50.562, Speaker A: Oh, I've seen it. I've seen it. Yeah. It's called zero x transmute, I think is what, what they're calling themselves. Basically. It's pretty simple. Just flash loans to settle a call option mostly with the current coupons throughout.
00:29:50.562 - 00:30:25.468, Speaker A: Because I don't think they have the logic to actually do like strike prices and check if the options in the money. Because right now all the o tokens that are out are perpetual discounts. Like, so they're not even bonds, they're just like. You can always get a 50% discount against the market price, which has nothing to do with an option or a bond. It's literally just like a coupon. So I don't think that model will work for ours, but thankfully we're going to do our own anyway with a much lower fee. Their fees, insane.
00:30:25.468 - 00:30:30.464, Speaker A: It's like three to 5%. Ours will be one basis point. So a little bit of a difference.
00:30:31.404 - 00:30:37.984, Speaker B: So could you license out the O token and AML to other projects?
00:30:38.324 - 00:31:00.730, Speaker A: Yes. So that's what TW pro is going to be doing is. Is basically allowed. They could get their own o token, have their own twaml, you know, have their own automated settlement. People could trade their lock positions, like everything. So that's going to be really exciting. And like I said, we got, we got some really awesome partners lined up for that already.
00:31:00.730 - 00:31:15.882, Speaker A: We're probably going to do six. So there's some slots open, but. But yeah, basically we're just trying to pick people we think are actually going to actually build this. Yeah, spend the time to do it. Exactly. Yeah.
00:31:15.978 - 00:31:45.510, Speaker B: So, yeah, so I wanted to bring up a few points and just kind of pick your brain on and expand on them from def liquidity mining. Um, too. Yeah, so the, we've said the fees versus kind of, um, expenses kind of model. And he brought up Aave GMX and Lido. And I remember a while back now what we had Kavas on tap talk and I joined that time and I think that was primarily his role at Lido to.
00:31:45.582 - 00:31:46.022, Speaker A: Yes.
00:31:46.118 - 00:32:05.984, Speaker B: How much can we fork out in LDO? And in comparison, what do we actually get back in return from that? So you brought up like Aave GMX and Lido, and are they the three that have kind of did it the best? Was that the reason behind that? And was there any kind of shortcomings or any kind of recurring themes that you've seen from those three during the research?
00:32:06.924 - 00:33:01.376, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question, actually. So what I saw was Lido had probably the most advanced analytics on their liquidity mining. I mean, I basically think why Lido's been successful, besides being the front runner on liquid staking derivatives, was the simple fact that they have a team of people who are looking at how much ldl can we put out each week. Where do we put it? Like, you know, if you spend millions of dollars on, on where to direct these emissions, you'll probably come up profitable, especially with a protocol like that that's just pure profit. Like there, you know, there's very little, you know, you know, kind of like, you know, multiple liquidity pools, multiple functions, and, you know, it's just one thing, you know, basically state deep liquidity. That's the goal. So that's definitely a big one.
00:33:01.376 - 00:33:37.478, Speaker A: GMX was the. Was. I think their success is completely predicated on the fact that they just struck gold with having an extremely rich service with margin trading. And basically, they also had a great model with vested emissions. I'm not a fan of vested emissions. I think it's just a band aid to a bullet wound. But when you have such a fee rich protocol, you're able to really do that.
00:33:37.478 - 00:34:14.147, Speaker A: Now they're seeing more competition with Quinta and stuff like that, where there's competitors that are driving those fees down, because back in the day, GMX's fees were, like, insane that they had. So that's a big one. Aave, I think, was pretty much the most disappointing one on that list, just because they've. As far as I remember, they never had a profitable year. Now, they're also not. They're not, like, deep in the red, but like that. I think the Aave economy is very poor.
00:34:14.147 - 00:34:39.238, Speaker A: Like, I think it's very basic. And they didn't, like, really put a lot into it, which, you know, is what it is. More. What I was surprised by was just how God damn unprofitable these, like, newer protocols are. Like, radiant Libra velodrome. Like, operating at, like, near 90% losses. Like, it's just nuts.
00:34:39.238 - 00:34:50.634, Speaker A: Um, but I mean, you know, there's. There's definitely some stuff afoot there with, like, subsidies from, like, optimism or, you know, different stuff like that that holds. Holds them up a little bit, but.
00:34:51.094 - 00:35:04.350, Speaker B: Can'T rely on that, though. It's like a. If you were to put, you were to put. You're going to rely on subsidies and grants from ecosystems as a business plan. It's that you're not going to get funded no more.
00:35:04.502 - 00:35:30.174, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's kind of what Camelot did, which is fine, too. But I mean, the thing. The thing is, is just like, I think the. I think it just proves how, like, just idiotic the model is and that, you know, there needs to be, you know, something forward. Like, we have an idea for. For, like, incentives that we may receive at some point. And it's not.
00:35:30.174 - 00:35:56.828, Speaker A: It's not call options and it's also not liquidity mining. So I'll be excited to show that one off one day when we get there. But. But, yeah, I mean, just basically, you know, I really wanted to see, like, who is, like, a lot of the top players, what is their. What's their. Their sheet looking like as far as expenses versus revenues and balance sheet. Um, and the one.
00:35:56.828 - 00:36:43.694, Speaker A: The one that I think always stands out to me is maker, um, just because maker, um, were before SDI anyway, were literally just raking in money hand over fist with almost no expenses at all over than their company overhead. Um, you can kind of look at them as like a stable coin issuer, like a circle, more so than like a decentralized, stable coin issuer. I think that criticism may be valid. I don't personally think it is, per se, but, um, just how monstrously profitable they are is insane. Now they've kind of destroyed that with SDI. They've been, you know, basically all, a lot of, not all, but a lot of the profits they've created in the last couple years. They're slamming into SDI, which I don't think is really that smart.
00:36:43.694 - 00:37:25.644, Speaker A: But, you know, I mean, it's profit. So I mean, you know, and it has, it has increased their, their numbers overall. So there is that. But yeah, I mean, that definitely, I think was the most interesting part. But I think even more interesting was like if you took bonds or call options and applied them to like an AAVE or compound, they would literally have the biggest treasury in Defi right now. Like, it just blows my mind, like just one small little tweak. Just take liquidity mining, put bonds or options, they'd have the biggest treasuries by a factor of two, which is insane.
00:37:26.624 - 00:37:30.056, Speaker B: Because Olympus is number one, isn't it? 130 something.
00:37:30.120 - 00:37:31.104, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:37:31.184 - 00:37:36.952, Speaker B: And that's, that's like they weren't really offering anything else apart from all they did.
00:37:37.048 - 00:38:16.574, Speaker A: The only reason why Olympus was successful is because they knew the one thing in Defi that was broken, the biggest important, most important thing, the economic model was broken. And all they did was take one little twist and then with protocol on liquidity, and then take advantage of the old farmers that they could print all these profits on Olympus. They came in and then boom, you have the biggest treasury now. They haven't done much good with it, I will say. But I mean, still, hats off to them. They still got to where they are just doing one small change and, you know, now they're sitting at the top. So.
00:38:17.294 - 00:38:39.966, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think of, so a lot of like those early OG DeFi protocols, they're kind of coming to the end of their emission cycles and like second supply is about to reach FTV. If then, if they're not tapping into like real profitability, like what's going to go on there?
00:38:40.110 - 00:39:20.680, Speaker A: We're going to see they're dead. They're, they're dead because here's the problem. They have no, they have no way of incentivizing continued growth protocols like tapioca do. So the, the attractiveness for a user is going to start really tilting in our favor over like an aave or compound and compound. And that's, that shows the true problem with liquidity mining after all these years, tons of fees, everything like that. Top protocols, they have zero to show for it. Like literally zero.
00:39:20.680 - 00:40:10.554, Speaker A: They have next to no treasuries. Their TVL is falling. It just shows how broken the model is. And that's where I think when Olympus came out and there's this whole Defi 2.0 cringey type name that was applied to like Fay and um, you know, tribe, dow, Frax and all these guys who came in trying to apply better models than the liquidity mining, um, you know, they blew up just because they had that one small change. And, and, and that's why I always kind of say you take a big change like what we're doing and I think you may have magic just from that, let alone like, you know, all of our feature sets and things like that. So it'll be really exciting to see.
00:40:10.554 - 00:40:57.040, Speaker A: And especially applied to a stable coin. I mean, you know, we've always had like, there's all these like athenas now where they're doing this wacky voodoo stuff with stable coins to make them scalable. And it's just like, guys, all you got to do is get rid of liquidity mining. You keep it over collateralized and you could do whatever you want and you still have the scale, you have scalability, but you keep, you keep the stability, which is important. And you also keep the censorship resistance which is important. So that alone I think is a major thing about like if you just took Olympus and Om was a stable like that, that was, that's actually how I've heard people explain us. And it's like you're kind of on to something with that description.
00:40:57.040 - 00:40:57.684, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:58.784 - 00:41:19.274, Speaker B: Do you like, it was quite a while back, I don't think we spoke about it, but have you seen these kind of muted volatility kind of eTH derivatives that came out the market like f of X protocol where you deposit etH and then you can break it into like the higher beta reef and then like the lower volume. Have you seen, have you seen any of those products?
00:41:19.814 - 00:42:13.630, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I'll just say on pretty much across the board, I think they're very cool to people who understand that type of stuff, especially like rad five level people. The problem is, and I, and I hope I'm wrong on this, honestly, because I like a lot of the guys behind these protocols, but I just don't think they have any product market fit. Like, I still think Defi is about yield. It's more degenerate where, you know, unfortunately it's a lot of like essentially gambling. And I just don't know if the product market fit is there for things like these, like actual options trading platforms or you know, volatility trading platforms or, you know, different stuff. I just don't know if the market is there yet. I hope it is, but I really just.
00:42:13.630 - 00:42:15.674, Speaker A: Gut feeling. Don't think it is.
00:42:16.894 - 00:42:49.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I know it feels like we've said this. I had the privy guys on, you know, the kind of people who are doing like the, like, you know, the signup process, the friend tech and the NPC wallets and stuff like that. And we were saying kind of how far we've got with kind of financial innovation on chain and then like user experience has kind of just been completely left by the wayside. It's quite funny to see how many, how many like primitives and derivatives and onion layers that we built in this space. And then like, the basics of onboarding have just completely been neglected.
00:42:49.884 - 00:43:51.894, Speaker A: No, all this stuff, like the only way you're actually pushing the space forward as far as onboarding is account abstraction and intents. Once account abstraction and intents have hit, I think you could start seeing people play with those type of advanced tooling. But again, I just think DeFi is still, Defi still equals yield and people want the yield as easily as possible. And if I can go get, you know, huge yields on a lending market or swapping to altcoins and things like that, I just don't see people going out of their way to trade options or something at the moment. Like, you know, hundred x leverage on GMX, sure. But like going into options, which I understand with an option you can do like infinity leverage and all that, that could work. But yeah, some of these things I just think are too advanced for the market they're in.
00:43:52.194 - 00:44:21.564, Speaker B: Yeah. What, um, I don't think I picked up, picked your brain on this as well. What do you think about this kind of evolution of, and it's just another layer on top of an airdrop, but, and I don't know who pioneered it. Maybe it was blur, but like, what do you think about points? Do you think it's just a way of teasing an airdrop about like categorically stating you're going to have an airdrop? Like, you think it's net positive. I've seen people grind it out for points and then get given like some match. Yeah, I think thousands of dollars.
00:44:21.904 - 00:45:16.218, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. No, I mean I, the whole thing around airdrops, my problem is like however way you, you paint an airdrop and package an airdrop, if it's points or, you know, galaxy quests or you know, Zoe campaigns, whatever the hell you do, you're ending up with a very zero sum negative sum rather, you know, exercise in which you're giving free tokens away to Sybils who sell said tokens and piss off and never come back. You know, obviously they're a good marketing tool. So I'm not saying the airdrop should just be thrown away and just don't do it. I'm not saying that. And especially networks do need to do an airdrop. Like if I'm in a celestia, I have to get gas in users hands so they can use my network.
00:45:16.218 - 00:46:00.176, Speaker A: So that's important. But that's why I'm so, I'm waving the flag so strong on our call option airdrop. Because even if you're Larry the yield farmer and you pop up and you just want free money and then you're never going to use tapioca. Well fine, we're going to get protocol owned liquidity off you. Thank you for the deposit. You know, make hoards of hoards of yield on that and see you never like, so when, when do whatever you want. And the, the point that it is a call option instead of paying like analytics firms, you know, x amount of dollars to always is our wallet list have sybils in it.
00:46:00.176 - 00:46:20.592, Speaker A: Of course it does. Like the doing a call option airdrop immediately. Those people go, wait, I gotta, I gotta buy this. But discounted, I'm not doing that. And you immediately get rid of all of these. Most of the Sybils, the ones that are smart enough to know there's profit are going to do it and screw off. But at least we still get the protocol and liquidity.
00:46:20.592 - 00:46:28.408, Speaker A: So I think just that small shift makes a big difference on the outcome of an airdrop.
00:46:28.456 - 00:46:52.896, Speaker B: So yeah, I was going to say we, before we released like the final kind of quest campaign for the LArp NFTs, I made sure I put the price, I made sure I put the price out there and I was like, look, they're going to be, I think, 0.1 for allow list, 0.3 for whitelist and then public starting at 0.5 ETH and everyone like I had DM's upon DM's. Upon DM has been like, this is a bear market. How can you charge 0.5 ETH?
00:46:52.920 - 00:46:55.504, Speaker A: And I was like, well, there you go. If.
00:46:55.584 - 00:47:00.324, Speaker B: If that is, like, too high of a price point for you, the product's not right for you.
00:47:00.864 - 00:47:28.184, Speaker A: Yeah, no, no, no, that, that's exactly, it's almost the same thing. Like, you're not getting something for free. You have to pay for it and you should have to pay for it. Like the, like, that's why I think giving, giving a discount effectively is, like, such a big difference because you literally do get rid of a lot of these people who just have no interest in actually using whatever you're doing.
00:47:29.284 - 00:47:48.424, Speaker B: That's, it's separating people out. And, like, I seen in, like, the, and the lot, we got laugh channel in discord. It was like, wait, why do you need the website to be ready? And I was like, it's literally an access pass for, like, a research open. I was like, I was like, please don't tell me you've taken up, like, a whitelist space. And I was like, oh, yeah.
00:47:51.004 - 00:48:21.944, Speaker A: We'Ve had, see, and that's what makes it so great with us is like, when we put the pearls out and we said, yeah, they're gonna get a big waiting in an airdrop. The unique ownership is still, like 70%. So we actually did a good job, I think, on giving them the people who actually had interest in the protocol based on how we did it. But on top of that, the people who were just wanted the money, and there was very few of them, they sold it and got lost. And they were selling them for like, 0.20.30 .5 east.
00:48:21.944 - 00:48:23.884, Speaker A: They're sitting that over in eth. Now.
00:48:25.224 - 00:48:35.614, Speaker B: You can literally kind of work out if you like, sit down for five minutes. If you work backwards, there should be, like some kind of floor price on them based on the airdrop. It's just like, people is like.
00:48:40.034 - 00:49:09.076, Speaker A: I know of quite a few people who are rf trading them with, with a price in mind, which you can look at like, okay, there's 714 aotap a piece. Okay? If taps, you know, $5 in the price, then, you know, my 50% discount. Okay, so the face values this. Okay, so my RFP values this. Like, I have seen people doing that, which is funny, but do it, that's fine. I mean, you know, just, you know what, whatever works is great, but it's cool. There's one guy that owns 15 of them.
00:49:09.076 - 00:49:25.208, Speaker A: He bought, he just bought 15 of them when they were during the, during when the market was down and someone was like, why are you buying all these? And he's like, dude, I have like 7000 tap right now, which is cool.
00:49:25.296 - 00:49:30.168, Speaker B: And he's probably all, the tap belongs to him. Yeah, I think, I think I know what he's getting at. That.
00:49:30.216 - 00:50:03.804, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I mean, it's just, you know, so, so it's cool though. I mean, but yeah, I think, I think the, the airdrop will be shifted more already. I mean, we kind of went from blasting amount of a bunch of free tokens to like the blur model of like, seasonal seasons of airdrops, which is basically almost like vesting, you know. And then I think the final thing will be, you don't get free tokens. You get, you know, bonds, you get, you know, you know, whatever, just, you know, something that's not free, basically.
00:50:05.024 - 00:50:08.764, Speaker B: Have you got, have you got, do you need to jump off now? Have you got five minutes?
00:50:09.064 - 00:50:11.376, Speaker A: Oh, no, I got some time. Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
00:50:11.480 - 00:50:52.416, Speaker B: All right, so what was it, right, buy buck and burn wasteful? Or did it get connotated with kind of ponzis and are now looking like a decent kind of model? What's your thoughts on it? Because I was looking at the inflation of top ten assets from their previous market cap all time highs. And BNB, because of their buyback and burn mechanism, is like 5% lower in circulating supply than it has been at the previous markup all time high, which I found was really, really interesting. But do you think buyback and burns a good, a good mechanism or do you think it's kind of a bit ponzi ish?
00:50:52.520 - 00:51:55.104, Speaker A: So just in one aspect, like, I think I'm still like split on like EIP 1559 for etherium because, like, I think to some degree, Ethereum has a problem in which it's trying to serve investors and speculators, and then it's also trying to serve users. And I think it should be solely serving users. Um, but on, but besides that, um, I don't like buying burns. Um, I think because the whole problem is, is you're buying, you're generally buying the token at a higher price than what you could sell it at. So you're losing money. Um, I do think, like, so I was talking about Rollbit, and in the article, um, the thing with that makes buybacks great with like, a roll bit is it creates reflex in that people are going, oh, my God, rollbit's going to burn like $10 million worth of RLB a month. So then that gets priced in and then magnified like, oh, I got to buy it even more.
00:51:55.104 - 00:52:46.214, Speaker A: So now the buyback is affecting the price more than what it actually should, just based on reflexivity. So that's kind of what I was explaining there in the article anyway. But I just think the problem in general is with a buyback is if a protocol is trying to reclaim their tokens, it should be at the lowest price possible. And not just to like pump the price like we saw with fracs. Frax was doing a twap by a frax of like $5 and FXS was only like three. So it's like you're buying above just to pump the price like you're wasting money. And it's something I've toyed a lot with tap as far as like what do, like what, how is the Dow going to interact with tap? And how do we do a buyback that's profitable? The first thing I looked at was like reverse LBP.
00:52:46.214 - 00:53:23.556, Speaker A: So you do an LBP, but instead of selling tap, you're buying it. And the price is, the price is constantly appreciating. So, and then the more, the more people sell it, the lower the price goes that basically the Dow will buy back at. So like Temple Dow used to do this and that's where I found it from. And they used to do buybacks, like very profitably, like below the market price. But I shredded that idea for my on demand liquidity idea with tap. Now, it's not something that's built yet and the Dow will have to approve it.
00:53:23.556 - 00:54:18.840, Speaker A: But basically, I think the concept is just phenomenal. Just be, just because the Dow would effectively be buying tapback at the price floor, which it means a lot lower than the current market price. And I think that should be the goal of a buyback. And secondly, if tapioca is buying tapback below market value, we could turn around and inject it into the gauges so that basically that tap will be sold OTAP, so that we're actually making a profit off of all this. Like we're buying it back at the floor and then we're selling it at a discount against the market. So we could actually have a positive cost basis that we're actually making money doing these buybacks. So I've been really excited about that because I think it's, I think it's a really incredible model.
00:54:18.840 - 00:54:33.482, Speaker A: And like I said, I think people are going to copy it to death when, um, when I explain, uh, exactly how it works. But, um. But yeah, I mean, I just think it's really cool. Um, and I was going to say one thing else, but it would give it away if I.
00:54:33.498 - 00:54:38.778, Speaker B: If I said, no, don't do it. They're listening. They're listening.
00:54:38.866 - 00:54:41.050, Speaker A: They are. Sure.
00:54:41.082 - 00:54:47.418, Speaker B: There's going to be, uh, definitely over a thousand people who watch this one, so. And then definitely don't do it.
00:54:47.546 - 00:55:21.346, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to keep. Keep this one to myself. But you will see it pretty soon. Everybody will see it pretty soon. But no, yeah, I mean, and I think, like, the other big model right now is doing the staking the LP tokens, the bouncer 80 20 stuff. And I just think it's kind of stupid because you're basically forcing lockers to eat impermanent loss, or rather, loss versus rebalancing LVR and also bouncer as a swap.
00:55:21.346 - 00:55:43.934, Speaker A: Currently, you're getting way less swap efficiency than if you were on like, a uni swap or a maverick or, you know, something like that. So. Also not. Not a fan, you know, I don't think LP should be like, I don't know, it's just, it's just something that never. That never clicked with me for. For those reasons.
00:55:44.694 - 00:55:50.582, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. What? Um. So why is go acting like it.
00:55:50.598 - 00:56:02.558, Speaker A: Is so very, very. Yeah, very. Yeah. I was memeing on Stan, either a little bit. He said. He said, rune bought. Ruhn bought a drink at the bar with go.
00:56:02.558 - 00:56:07.874, Speaker A: And I said, did the waiter, did the bartender value go at a dollar?
00:56:09.934 - 00:56:11.702, Speaker B: And is that going out his paycheck?
00:56:11.838 - 00:56:29.104, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. But it's really simple. They released an extremely derivative stablecoin. Like, just something that. It's just a fixed interest rate. Here you go. And with a fixed interest rate, you can never match the market.
00:56:29.104 - 00:57:08.844, Speaker A: And the second problem is, why would I hold go? What is my supply side incentive for go? Like, my. There is none. Like, do I lp it and lose because it's deep? No. Do I? Like, there's nothing to do with it. Like, so of course people are going to swap out and it's going to remain deep pegged. Their idea, I believe, is to go on the maverick and then put a liquidity range only at a dollar. But then I just see people keep swapping it on uniswap and they'll just keep swapping it at $0.96.
00:57:08.844 - 00:57:18.604, Speaker A: They also have a PSM they want to do. But I just think, like, who thought this out? Like, like, this is very basic of, like, supply and demand.
00:57:19.104 - 00:57:20.936, Speaker B: It was a bit off back, doesn't it?
00:57:21.080 - 00:57:39.156, Speaker A: Yeah. It just feels like they rushed it out and there's no. There's just no reason to use it. I mean, if I was them, quite simply, I'd open. You know, like, I'd incentivize the lending pool of. Of go with Aave tokens. Like, just something.
00:57:39.156 - 00:58:47.272, Speaker A: I mean, that's pretty simple, but just something I've seen they wanted to go to, like, aura and convex and stuff like that. And my problem with both of those is, I think you're just shifting the onus of liquidity mining onto someone else and acquiring in a liquid token that has a high carry cost because it's inflationary. And secondarily, you're not really solving the problem that yield farming is parasitic. You're just cycling it on to someone else. So I just don't really think that's, like, the whole point of the tapioca model is we're locking up USDO from lenders, and then borrowers can pay more to get their USDO and then use it in, like, yield strategies, leveraged yield strategies, et cetera. Like, I got some SDI I can go over to tapioca, go borrow against it, go get some of these guys locked USDO, and then boom, they're getting real yields. I'm getting a good borrow rate on a really attractive asset that I can get one click leverage on.
00:58:47.272 - 00:59:17.606, Speaker A: You know, bada bing, bada boom. And then, you know, GLP, GMX, V two, LP, you know, other strats that we have that I can't really mention yet. But, yeah, I mean, you know, that's. That, I think, is an economy around the stable coin. Not. Not so much what Avi is doing, unfortunately. But I hope they figure out something, just because I think people kind of look at this as, like, I don't think CDP stable coins work, and they really do.
00:59:17.606 - 01:00:24.986, Speaker A: It's just, you got to understand supply and demand, and you have to understand how interest rates affect things and all that type of stuff. Which, last thing on tapioca for this one, one of the most ingenious ideas we got from Chaos Labs was to institute a mint fee. So, like, we had an interest rate, but then they said, okay, well, what if you instituted a mint fee by which, if USDO is below peg, that you have to pay an additional 1% upfront to mint or an additional 2% upfront to mint? And I was like, that's a great idea. Then we're actually making money if USDO is de pegged as well. The other thing as well is with our UI guy, the great idea, he was like, wait, why don't we just tell people to go swap on uniswap for USDO instead of minting it? Because you could go on uniswap and mint it. I'm sorry. You go on uniswap and swap for it.
01:00:24.986 - 01:00:47.414, Speaker A: If it's dpeg that say, like $0.98, you'll get it for 98. Whereas if you mint it, you're minting it at a dollar. So, like, why don't we recommend people to go over here? And I was like, oh, that's a great idea. And we actually found out Lido does that where, like, if stake deep is below peg, they'll say, no, no, no, don't mint it. Just go buy it on uniswap or curve.
01:00:48.974 - 01:00:54.622, Speaker B: Makes sense. Just a simple ui trick there. And that's like, yeah, you know, that's a beauty of good design, isn't it?
01:00:54.758 - 01:00:56.194, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
01:00:57.894 - 01:01:12.114, Speaker B: What? Just one or two more from me. What did you think of the Celestia Airdrop? And did you think people faded it? And do you think it's as a big of a deal as people are making out?
01:01:12.874 - 01:02:37.656, Speaker A: Oh, man. So, you know, one thing is, you know, with, with Celestia that I've is like, once EIP 4844 comes out and also like, blob space and all this type of stuff, why would I, like, once that's out, why would I use, like, a Celestia over using like, ethereum's data availability and, like, secondarily with like, eigen layer and things like that? It seems like the space is getting a little bit crowded and I'm not quite sure on who's going to be a winner. If it's going to be ethereum, people start using ethereum, data availability if people start using Eigen layer, which I think is very probable, or if people use Celestia, I'm still a Giga Cosmos bear. I think it's an ultra fragmented space, um, that has just one of the worst UX's in, in crypto and defi period. Um, like, I just don't, I'm just not a fan of it in general. I am a Thor chain fan, but that's kind of that, that's a big one. I'm actually a fan of IBC, but, yeah, I mean, it's just, it's just, you know, one of those things for me personally that I've never been like a big Cosmos guy, but.
01:02:37.656 - 01:02:48.804, Speaker A: So I'm excited to see what, you know, how the stuff works out and who's going to be the dominant player right now. I think it'll be Eigen, but. Yeah, we'll see.
01:02:49.184 - 01:03:05.348, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is getting recorded on 20th November and we got the PiF airdrop tonight, I think. Do you think there needs to be much more competition to chain link in the Oracle space because it feels like they're a little bit monopolistic?
01:03:05.396 - 01:03:05.932, Speaker A: Yes.
01:03:06.068 - 01:03:07.252, Speaker B: Dare I say it?
01:03:07.428 - 01:03:50.024, Speaker A: Yes. The biggest need right now is for huge competition against chain link. I don't know if Python is going to be that competitor, honestly. I mean, basically you're talking like a push versus a pole oracle. So, you know, they're very diametrically opposed on, you know, how they work. And actually chain link V two is going to more of a push model, kind of like pipe. But I don't know, I'll just say with Google entering with Layer Zero, my dream is Google becoming, offering price feeds and things like that and becoming dominant.
01:03:50.024 - 01:04:36.480, Speaker A: I think that would be really great for the space just because of the type of network, the behemoth of the network that Google has. And I think that would be a game changer. I think it's going to be very hard for any, like web3 player to come up and amass the type of capital and connections that Chainlink has. But I think a Google could just stomp them out and, you know, I'm not going to say I'd love to see it, but I'd love to see competition is what I'll say. And I think it's really highly needed. I think a lot of people understate like chain link as far as the danger it poses to defi, as far as if those feeds stop working and a lot of people go, oh, it's too big to fail. It's too big to fail.
01:04:36.480 - 01:05:23.828, Speaker A: Nothing is too big to fail. And the second thing is there is a multisig, I think right now it's like a five of 20, if I'm not mistaken. It's changed a few times, but nobody knows who the signers are. I'm kind of standing on my Chris black soapbox here and the CCIP guys are going to be writing me death letters here after this. But, yeah, I mean, I'm, you know, I'll just say I, you know, I like CCIP. It's just I am fully a proponent of the future is, is modular and not monolithic, but yeah, I mean, and then also I love chain link oracles, obviously. Tapioca uses chain link oracles with uni v three oracles in an aggregate.
01:05:23.828 - 01:06:16.300, Speaker A: So if chainlink ever fails, Tapioca keeps functioning with uni v three oracles forever since they're immutable. But basically if a Google came in or another player like that, pipe some, you know, somehow gives a big punch to chain link. I think obviously, like I said, competition is good. It's kind of like geth or different, you know, client softwares. For Ethereum, if everyone's running the same client software just like everyone's running the same oracle, you are creating a catastrophic event waiting to happen versus if everyone's using different things, you know, you could, you know, you, you can have basically that defense mechanism like, okay, these protocols aren't running this oracle, they're running this. You know what I mean?
01:06:16.492 - 01:06:46.936, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's like one of the main bull points of like Solana and Fire dancer. I know it's going to be like even more performant than it is, but just that second client, obviously just a bit of a backup if anything were to go wrong with the original. But yeah, I don't think I have any more questions to pick your brain with. I'm sure there are a million things I will come up with, but no, I really enjoyed the chat and it's, it's good to catch up again and hopefully we can turn back on soon again and run it back.
01:06:47.120 - 01:07:14.530, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I hope everybody had fun listening to this. I tried to give a little bit of alpha here and there. Obviously always a great conversation, but yeah, no, always a big pleasure to come on the block maid show. So glad you had me on. And shout out everybody listening. Our genesis is coming up soon, so come check out, come check us out. Discord slash discord.
01:07:14.530 - 01:07:26.214, Speaker A: GG, tapioca dow x, tapioca underscore Dow. And then you can find me ship posting at twmat with three t's. So there you go.
01:07:27.834 - 01:07:32.846, Speaker B: Right, I'll leave all that in the description as well. Thanks a lot, everyone, and we'll catch you next time. Take it easy.
01:07:33.010 - 01:07:33.750, Speaker A: Gn.
