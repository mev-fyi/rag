00:00:00.320 - 00:00:25.294, Speaker A: Alright, just a quick one before we get going. So please don't take anything you hear in today's episode as financial advice. Please speak to a trained professional if you do wish to participate in markets. Crypto is inherently risky and you will lose all your money, particularly if you listen to us for financial direction. So enough of that. Please give us a, like, subscribe, enjoy the show, and see you next time. Alright, welcome back.
00:00:25.294 - 00:00:48.484, Speaker A: Another episode of still early, a little bit of a change this time, I think the last episode where Jordy wet my appetite to get some more market participants on, as opposed to founder series and all that kind of good stuff. So being joined, fortunately, by salsa, who you might know as raging hot chili Pepper, who outroids every single one of you who listen to this salsa. How's it going, bud?
00:00:49.064 - 00:00:51.364, Speaker B: Doing great. Thanks for having me.
00:00:51.824 - 00:01:02.494, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. As I say in off, it feels like I've been following your account for what feels like a lifetime now. But when did you make the account?
00:01:04.474 - 00:01:17.614, Speaker B: I think it was 2013, something like that. But I never posted until 2017. I never even logged on Twitter much. So. Been posting since 2017. Really?
00:01:18.434 - 00:01:30.164, Speaker A: All right, sweet. Yeah. So was really early. What was the, so when were you kind of coming into your crypto origin story? What were you, what, what rough year was that?
00:01:31.184 - 00:02:05.110, Speaker B: The origin story is, I think I said many times, so I don't want to go too deep in details. Roughly speaking, I got into BTC because it was a necessity for me. I was transacting online. I was doing some, some, some sort of betting online with an edge through video games, and I was selling the currency for real money. And PayPal didn't like it. I was a miner at the time. They locked me and they didn't allow me to appeal.
00:02:05.110 - 00:02:37.162, Speaker B: So I found bitcoin and that was the solution for me and that's why I got into it. I wish I seen it as an investment back then, but I really did not. I did many mistakes, did not hold, and I only started getting into the investing and trading through the 2017 bull run. So when I think late 2016, it start moving, but I really only start trading 2017. Buying Ethereum investing, having a more long term value appreciation. Opinion on crypto?
00:02:37.298 - 00:03:06.866, Speaker A: Yeah, I think PayPal, I've got a lot to answer for. Everyone's adoption of this industry. Like mine personally, I got, I got banned from eBay when I was like 15, and I don't think I ever let that go. And then when I seen, because a lot of people come into it from a different, a couple of different lenses right. So it's one, born out of necessity, two, maybe it's a philosophical angle, three, maybe it's, you know, like a purely financially motivated decision. But yeah, I think PayPal, I've got a lot to answer for.
00:03:07.040 - 00:03:10.274, Speaker B: Lots of poker players as well, from what I understand.
00:03:11.254 - 00:03:19.174, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So did you learn kind of markets just purely from, from scratch? Just been kind of intrigued by the.
00:03:19.334 - 00:04:00.394, Speaker B: Intrigue I was trying to interact on was mostly Twitter 2017. I was asking a bunch of people questions. Peter Brand Cryptorica, those kind of people that were frequently posting back then. I was even watching YouTube crypto at the time, which I don't do anymore. I don't really put much weight on other people's opinion, but it's a learning curve. And at the time, I was just trying to ask question pointers and trying to learn from others. And what happened is I was extremely biased towards technical analysis because that's basically what most people point me towards.
00:04:00.394 - 00:05:32.566, Speaker B: But there was cryptorcha that also gave me book suggestions, reminiscence of the stock operator, those kind of, those kind of books where you have psychology added, which I think was, was really good advice to read those psychology book. And in hindsight, the more you trade, the more you understand the meaning of the book. So fast forward a few years, I think I did very good in 2017, which was all luck and blind left curve holding of coins, and then I lost most of it. 2018, and I think late 2018 is really where I started being good at trading, started making a bit of money and being somewhat profitable, and then joined Prop Shop in 2019, which is where I really went forward with a strong advance in the learning curve, where I kind of dismantled some biases I had, especially about technicals. My opinion on technical analysis, I think I posted about that before, but it's a marketing tool and it's extremely easy to sell technical analysis, and I think that's the only reason it's so popular. And I think that people focus too much on it. There's a lot of ways to gain edge over the market, and technical analysis is maybe you can gain a small edge, but everybody looks at the same thing and there's not that much of it that I use anymore.
00:05:32.566 - 00:06:15.500, Speaker B: Maybe a little bit, but it's not really my edge. And joining prop shop and seeing traders do very well without any technicals. There was a guy that used to manage a fund that I would come into office and see every day, and he would trade from just a ladder that shows basically the order book clicking and the newsfeed and he made money on a bunch of markets doing just that, just order book and news feed. That's it. And it shocked me that he has zero charts on this computer screen. So this really changed my perspective on trading a lot and debunked that bias, which helped me grow as a trader man.
00:06:15.612 - 00:06:52.636, Speaker A: That is so kind of topical for what's kind of going on with a lot of. So we took on like my friend who came from like a traditional CMO background. And obviously when you're in this space, you kind of, you can't help but like take notes of what's happening. And he's just going through, he's like, should I be learning like technical analysis? Like how do I approach markets? And he's obviously getting more and more intrigued as time goes on. And I'm just like, just keep it as simple as physically is physically possible. But I also think it's kind of a rite of passage to, you can tell people not to kind of go down that rabbit hole. And obviously there's a lot of benefit that can be derived from it.
00:06:52.636 - 00:07:22.892, Speaker A: But I think people get a little bit, they trip over themselves and they have all these weird magical indicators. Hopefully they haven't paid for these really weird indicators and stuff like that. But I think when you come full circle and you figure out your kind of approach to the markets, it just becomes, yeah, I'll look at Dexcreen and I won't even have to open the chart and I'll just see the price of something and think, all right, I might be start pay attention to that now. So it's weird, isn't it? I think everyone goes through the full cycle of having a chaotic chart and then just taking a step back.
00:07:23.068 - 00:08:07.788, Speaker B: Yeah, the chaotic chart is really a big trap that I eventually got rid of after joining prop shop. Like, if you have a bunch of indicators and lines on your chart, it's going to confuse you. It will confuse you. When you're in a trade, you will enter for a specific reason. Let's say you enter front running some guy that's buying on Coinbase, for example, and you try to front run their orders and then the trade goes your way and you lose the focus of, you enter the trade because of that coinbase buyer, just a random example. And you look at your lines on the chart and then suddenly it hits that line that looks like a resistance and you close the trade because of that line. But you didn't care about that line when you enter the trade.
00:08:07.788 - 00:08:24.224, Speaker B: So that's a mistake you need to execute because of your entry reason, your entry reason will be your edge on that given trade. And that's potentially, that should be the reason you exit the trade as well. So people lose focus because of it.
00:08:24.884 - 00:08:48.524, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So what's your kind of typical? Is there any kind of methods of madness now? If you kind of got your way of approaching like, is it primarily just looking at floors? Is there a, like a, not a checklist, but, and I know a lot of it will probably come off just instinct now because the amount of time you spent in the market. But is there like anything you're primarily looking for before you enter in?
00:08:49.344 - 00:09:23.082, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm a big believer in knowing what not to do. Everybody knows, everybody makes money trading once in a while, and eventually you find out what works and what doesn't. If you know what not to do and minimize the mistakes, that's a big part of compounding over time. I found many ways to do that for myself. I tend to over bet, for example, so I have ways to mitigate that. So knowing what not to do and learning it and not repeating the same mistakes is a huge aspect of profitability.
00:09:23.082 - 00:10:00.046, Speaker B: Like those small tweaks of just, let's say, the open interest gets really heated and you start feeling FOMo. And then you do Fomo. This is a big one. Like, you see bitcoin run from thirty nine k to fifty three k for me. And then I close my trade too early and I see the market start rallying and I feel fomo. And then you're very tempted to just smash the market buy, but you're not applying consciousness about the risk you're taking. The risk is that it can go all the way back to then.
00:10:00.046 - 00:10:24.684, Speaker B: If you get liquidated at 51k, you're fucked. You lose the account, and that's just not worth it. You need to enter on dips that can help you define your risk and small things like that, that you avoid those mistakes and you'll compound your portfolio way more over a year. And then obviously about what to do. It's all about edge. The only thing that makes money trading is edge. I find a lot of value in front running.
00:10:24.684 - 00:10:52.944, Speaker B: I use order books. I use open interest to kind of gauge. I think open interest has been good past few months to gauge in the short term. If you couple it with the founding rates, you can kind of gouge into positioning. So that's something that helps me. But ultimately, the way I trade is not really relevant to the audience in general is just pointers. You have to find your own edge, and there's many ways to find edge.
00:10:52.944 - 00:11:01.694, Speaker B: You just have to kind of click, look and understand what works over many trades and keep that going for you.
00:11:02.714 - 00:11:41.954, Speaker A: Yeah, that over trading thing completely hits home on me because the glass cycle did okay for myself. Kind of cut a lot of stuff, not like at the top. I'm not going to say I'm timing tops and timing bottoms or anything like that, but it's the boredom in between what's kind of happening now that I felt like I'm just giving way too much back. It's like, is there, is there anything you've kind of figured out to do? You take like a large amount off the table where you just can't get easy access to it, and then you just trade with like a smaller account whilst, you know, you're in these less than favorable markets. Like, how do you manage exactly how I do.
00:11:42.854 - 00:12:28.624, Speaker B: So, as I said, I used to have big problem with over bedding, risking the house, which I don't have anymore, and that's since I implemented this. So first of all, I'm in crypto because I believe long term it has a value proposal, specifically bitcoin. It's the one that I think has the most value proposal. I think it's going higher in a couple years. If I'm wrong and it's lower in two, three years, then I'll start worrying about that thesis. But if it has a value proposal, one of the biggest mistake I can do as a participant in this industry is not to have long exposure. So with the profits, first of all, I cash out so that I'm okay outside of crypto for about ten years.
00:12:28.624 - 00:13:05.844, Speaker B: That's my personal preference. I think everyone should have two years leeway if they want to go full time trading. That's a minimum to not feel stressed and make mistakes based off of that stress. So being comfortable and financially secure outside of crypto so that you can have your mind straight when you're trading and not worry too much about outcomes is a big thing then. Secondly, with that crypto portfolio, I put basically all of it. If I think bitcoin is going higher, I put 95% of my portfolio and spot bitcoin and eat ETH is a bit more speculative, but I think it's also a good bet. So only bitcoin and heat are my holding.
00:13:05.844 - 00:13:59.816, Speaker B: Maybe a bit here and there, a few percent, but it's negligible in comparison. And then with maybe one to 5%, I allow myself to deposit to leverage exchange. And how that works is that all these leverage exchange, they give you leverage for a reason. You can use that leverage to your advantage. A lot of people say leverage is bad, but if you make a habit of depositing one to 5% and building an account, the only way I will get to a sizable position is if I build that account from one to 5% to the equivalent of ten to 15%, then I can bet much bigger. So I deserve my size in that way. And typically, that means I will bet bigger when it's going well, and I tend to cash out when it reaches a certain size that I think, okay, I don't need that much to trade.
00:13:59.816 - 00:14:35.696, Speaker B: I pull out this much, and I'll just keep trading with that amount. If the account ever goes bust, I never redeposit before a night's sleep. So basically, every time I deposit, it's one to 5% of my crypto portfolio maximum. And then if I lose that deposit, I at least get a very good night's sleep before I redeposit. And that works pretty well because you're a different person after a night's sleep. You're not emotional, you're well rested, you're there mentally, and that can avoid a lot of mental mistakes. So that's the way it works for me.
00:14:35.696 - 00:15:11.804, Speaker B: That's the way I mitigate my risk. Obviously, counterparty risk is a big talk about why you should use leverage. But I think you, as a human, is the biggest vector of harm for your portfolio. I mean, if I have all my portfolio on buy bid at any given point, at some point, I will get huge fomo and conviction in a trade, and I will bet the house. I know it. And you need to mitigate that risk, because if you bet the house, at any point in time, you risk bankruptcy. And you risk bankruptcy over a long enough time, you will lose everything.
00:15:13.344 - 00:16:01.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's a really important idea, just to kind of silo it away and even having those kind of, what would you even call it? Just, like, little barriers to entry, you know, like, having it on a ledger that might not be within your vicinity or just kind of making the friction a little bit higher to actually go and redeposit. But I think getting a good night's sleep is a really good one, because, like, as soon as you just start, like I said, betting the house purely on emotion, like, all of your trading experience from years gone by, just completely goes out the window. And I think, I think it happens to more than people would admit, particularly, you can kind of see it in the bear market. People get up to some shady shit during the bear market, and I think they've kind of blown their accounts up. But how many times around did it take you to realize this?
00:16:02.794 - 00:16:48.374, Speaker B: I started implementing this when I joined prop shop. I had people monitor my risk and I noticed I do way better on the prop shop accounts because I had all those advice about risk management. And really what that helped me is just avoid the mistakes because I tend to have my biggest losses back then when I already had a big loss, so I had a big loss, and then I make mistakes trying to make it back. There's a million traps that I made many times, but it was around 2019. When you get that in check, it helps you focus on edge and not falling into mistakes. So it all comes down again to what not to do, and it helps me avoid what not to do.
00:16:49.554 - 00:17:21.056, Speaker A: Yeah. Did that help with, like, it takes a specifically disciplined kind of mindset to be accountable to yourself, but did that help working in prop shop, having that, like, adjacent kind of accountability there that way? Kind of because someone says, oh, I've got a trading journal, I can talk myself out of it. Like, you can't control the markets, you can only control yourself. That's all well and good. Like, when you're saying it and kind of people are putting out there, but unless you put it into practice, it's as good as bullshit, isn't it? Really?
00:17:21.200 - 00:18:11.110, Speaker B: I don't really journal anymore. Like maybe once a month I will write a bit about how, how it went this month and try to be reminiscent of what happened and, and try to understand myself and my trading a bit better. But I don't journal on a day to day basis anymore. I used to do that for a little while. It was mostly twice a week, not once a day. But I think having someone watch over you, especially your risk, why you take a trade, especially when you're on that undisciplined stage where you're uncertain about why you take trades, you're just trying to gain a bunch of experience. It really makes you think twice before clicking a button, and it makes you want to at least be able to justify why you clicked and they did not care about the outcome.
00:18:11.110 - 00:18:53.156, Speaker B: It's not about the outcome. You don't ever evaluate a trade as to if it made money or not. You evaluate the trade as to why did you enter it and was it a good trade? And some good trades can make money. Some good trades can lose money. Similarly, bad trades can make you money, and that's not a good thing. So I would say having someone watch over you your risk is great in the beginning phase. That keeps you in check, really, especially if they force you to implement certain risk management measures and that you see yourself over a year, two years, build that equity curve and that you're like.
00:18:53.156 - 00:19:29.828, Speaker B: In my case, I was running a personal account that just had some wild swings and did not even do better versus that prop shop account that was pretty continuous, like constantly grinding up. And I did not have those wild swings because I had those hard stops and risk measures in place. So you start to realize that it's really necessary, and risk management itself is not an edge. I say that many times. It's just a necessity for you to survive as a trader. If you don't have it, you will go bankrupt. It's as simple as that.
00:19:29.828 - 00:19:36.504, Speaker B: But it does really help you keep yourself from doing mistakes.
00:19:37.484 - 00:19:53.154, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. So where do you think we're at now? Obviously, we had sell off because GPTC overhang and all that kind of good stuff. But how are you thinking going into Q two, Q three, and even towards the end of the year.
00:19:56.054 - 00:20:48.782, Speaker B: I can give a bit of context as to the move we just had and where we're at right now. I'm a bit less confident. But one thing I've noticed in crypto, and that's since 2018, is that the best trades, generally speaking, are always when the market has some kind of a correction, and then it gets hit with bad news, and it doesn't dump when the headline is quite bad. So just now, for example, we had some very bad thought about grayscale. That was the main narrative all the way down from forty eight k to thirty eight point five. So that was quite a fright for many people. And I think it got overly priced in, in the sense that people were starting to front run the outflows heavily.
00:20:48.782 - 00:21:28.266, Speaker B: And then on the outflows, at some point I start noticing around the open, when you see the flows from grayscale to Coinbase, it starts pumping the market when you would expect the dumps. But my theory is that it's just people front running and being more aggressive, but the expectation of it is that those flows are people selling. When they come, the market should sell off and then it starts pumping on it. And then the next day, same thing. Pumping on the flow. Pumping on the flow. And then there was the us government sending some 130 m worth of BTC to sell and market pumps on that as well.
00:21:28.266 - 00:22:01.562, Speaker B: So at some point you've got something has to click in your brains that it's not going down. And I think we were around thirty nine k at the time. When that clicked in my brains, I knew it's very likely it goes back to new highs. And that was it. That was the bottom. So the bad news getting shrugged off by the market is a very, very good indication that we're going up. And in my opinion, the best trade in crypto the other way probably works to shave off some risk, but it doesn't work as well.
00:22:01.562 - 00:22:12.928, Speaker B: The long side is the best. So that's from my experience. I've seen it in ETF, denied in 2018, Tetrafud many times. I mean, we've seen Tetrafud at like 20k this year. Sorry, last year.
00:22:13.096 - 00:22:25.560, Speaker A: I think there's some more brewing as well. Isn't that it seems like, see that woman in Congress the other day saying like, tether and then USDC have cancelled deposits on a tron. That's, I don't, I don't know what to make of that, to be honest.
00:22:25.592 - 00:23:03.152, Speaker B: But I don't know what to make of that right now either. I think right now people have a lot of, like, they were looking at NVDA earnings, to name a few examples of what I was saying. There was Bitmex implementing KYC in 2019 with Trump announcing more restrictions. I think that was around, no, that was 2020, around like around ten K USD per BTC, if I recall correctly. And it just pumped on that to 69k after that binance. KYC as well, I think was at around forty k. And then it pumped higher.
00:23:03.152 - 00:23:37.172, Speaker B: And after FTX collapsed, there was some grayscale FuD, I think after the run up from fifteen k to eighteen k or something like that. And the fud hits and market just shrugs it off and starts having Dalai Lama for the first time in a long time. And those are the strongest signal in crypto. As to where we are now, I'm not exactly sure. I think the market has ran up since that bad news gets absorbed. We've seen some take profit on a few exchange. There's some resistance in terms of order book, purely.
00:23:37.172 - 00:23:56.702, Speaker B: I mean, I've seen some large bundle of orders on Bitfinex. Ultimately. I mean, to name one exchange, ultimately, I think it's mostly just ranging. Maybe it just chops around 50k is what I think is most likely. It's really just a guess. I cannot know that ahead of time. Ultimately, I think it will.
00:23:56.702 - 00:24:23.962, Speaker B: There's no reason to be bearish. It's more likely to continue higher. But the path to higher could make casualties. So it can easily dump 510 percent for bitcoin. And a lot more for altcoins, like 30% for some altcoins. And if you're levered long at this particular spot, you're at great risk of getting blown out. So I think it's the time to be patient to just try to buy dips and sell the ribs.
00:24:23.962 - 00:24:47.644, Speaker B: And if we get the bigger diploma, five to 10% on BTC, maybe like 47k, something like that, that would be great. I don't know if I get lucky to get such a dip, but those are kind of the opportunities that I value more. I wouldn't just fomo here, basically with leverage, that is, I think it goes higher over a period of one year. Hard to time the market short term.
00:24:48.584 - 00:25:02.354, Speaker A: See? So will you play in this range then? Will you get down into low timeframes and play around that? Is that or will you just kind of wait to see if you can get a high timeframe, better entry, and kind of just swing that way?
00:25:03.174 - 00:25:59.454, Speaker B: So I'm a big believer in monitoring a few things, like if there's a big dip, let's say we go all the way back to 48k, or let's say just below 50k. In order for me to buy, I want to see a few things. And one of the things I monitor is the open interest coupled with the founding rates to get a grasp. Like is the open interest rising? Is the founding rate ticking up while the open interest is rising? And that can indicate the general positioning of traders. Maybe more traders are, let's say the open interest is going up and the founding rates are going up. Most likely the average trader is trying to long on leverage because that's in essence, the funding rates, in essence just says it goes up. That means the futures are trading at the premium.
00:25:59.454 - 00:26:40.664, Speaker B: And so with the open interest rising, you can, for example, guess that on those futures products, the average trader is long. So that would make me not want too long with them because there might be a squeeze a bit lower. Those are the kind of things that tell me what not to do. It will not tell me to short. I don't necessarily act on what to do on those kind of weak indicators. It won't give me a trade, but this will really keep me in check from longing too early or shorting too early, depending on what happens. So it's very hard to say how the market will look if we go below 50k, because there's a few metrics like that that I want to monitor.
00:26:40.664 - 00:27:07.994, Speaker B: But ultimately, for sure, the market could easily go back below fifty k. And I think looking at how the sentiment tends to flip wildly from negative to positive on small fluctuations. Right now, the most likely scenario is we just chop around current price, maybe plus minus two, three k. And that would hurt many people who are trying to get a gamble in at the same price that trades for the past few days.
00:27:08.934 - 00:27:37.374, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. These are like the boring times where you just need to be a little bit more patient, I think from past experience anyway, because I can quite quickly find myself getting too caught up in just short term price action and then, you know, everything takes off without me. But is there anything like, aside from I know you, bitcoin Eve, I seen you mentioning stocks on the timeline the other day. Is that more of just a maybe a spot exposure way to get higher bet bitcoin or what's the thinking now?
00:27:37.834 - 00:27:58.370, Speaker B: I was trying to trade it and I actually lost money on it. I think I bought the top. So I'm not that qualified. Like, I'm not that qualified to give advice. I made a bit earlier on it because I was purely copying defi square. I think he made a thread about it and made me a bit of money. The truth is, I suck at altcoins.
00:27:58.370 - 00:28:23.590, Speaker B: I think that stack, like l two s and bitcoin, has potential as a narrative. There's so much money stuck on bitcoin and stacks is potentially one of those that has the ability to access that capital. Stacks is very close to all time highs. I think all time high is three point two, five cents and three dollars. Twenty five cents. And right now trading at 2.6 near the all time highs.
00:28:23.590 - 00:28:53.364, Speaker B: And we know that those coins tend to run hard when in price discovery, assuming the rally is real. So that's why it's interesting to me maybe to buy a dip on stocks. But again, instead of fomoing at the top, it's probably best to kind of wait for a dip. Like, let's say bitcoin dips below 50k, stocks can easily dip to like $2. And that's where I would buy it, basically. I think that's a much better trade.
00:28:54.594 - 00:29:11.574, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think going in, I think it's relatively unusable at the minute. It's great in, great idea on paper. And then I think middle of April, if I'm not mistaken, they've got this huge Nakamoto upgrade where it actually begins to actually be usable.
00:29:11.994 - 00:29:33.574, Speaker B: And I've seen projects raised for it. I've seen one project raise for it, which is a decentralized exchange trying to build on top of stack. We will see how that goes. But, you know, there's a lot of use case for this kind of idea. Whether they can morph it into a reality, that's another story. When did you say that Nakamoto update was again?
00:29:34.114 - 00:29:36.054, Speaker A: I think it's April 15.
00:29:36.954 - 00:29:38.454, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's quite soon.
00:29:41.354 - 00:29:42.654, Speaker A: Trying to find the.
00:29:43.274 - 00:29:49.130, Speaker B: A bit more like two months. About two months. So maybe that narrative picks up. I wouldn't be surprised.
00:29:49.242 - 00:30:08.414, Speaker A: 15 till the 29th. So it might be within that range. So potentially three to four weeks. I still think it's pretty, pretty far out. Enough to kind of catch another leg in my opinion. But as you say, you probably want to get a nicer entry if you listen to this.
00:30:08.794 - 00:30:13.894, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I think as well. Don't listen to the voice of FOmO.
00:30:17.104 - 00:30:32.512, Speaker A: Where do you, aside from the charts, where do you kind of look for your more fundamentals or even where you kind of sourcing your news from? Have you got a. Do you use tweet decks or how do you approach that aspect of the market?
00:30:32.688 - 00:31:05.344, Speaker B: Twitter and Telegram. Telegram. I'm in a few groups. Zoomer News, DB, those kind of outlets I get the main news from and then I'm on Twitter all the time, so I get a lot of news from it. Let's say the grayscale outflows I got from Acram. So I built alert from it, but the alerts were quite delayed. So I ended up going directly to the website and kind of following the address myself.
00:31:05.344 - 00:31:14.254, Speaker B: Refreshing when I expect the outflows to be. And then I kind of get the idea of exactly when it is. But mostly Twitter and telegram.
00:31:15.954 - 00:31:28.534, Speaker A: Yeah, it was funny when I think Arkham caused a huge sell off maybe six months ago when someone, I think they labeled a wallet wrong or something and then someone else picked it up. It just cascaded from that.
00:31:28.994 - 00:31:39.414, Speaker B: Those are the best trade when you know for a fact it's wrong and it just sold off like crazy. You just, if you're early to catch it on, you, you put the trade on. It's free money.
00:31:39.964 - 00:31:44.308, Speaker A: Can you remember the. Was it Walmart and litecoin? Can you remember that one?
00:31:44.476 - 00:32:04.444, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I long that. I long that litecoin. But I caught it live, right? Because at that time nobody was on the computer. It was like those dry times where not that many people are active. So I think I caught it like 10 seconds late, but that was enough for me to long. And then I re.
00:32:04.444 - 00:32:22.060, Speaker B: And then I text my friend, yo, Walmart, accept litecoin. He's like, there's no fucking way, man. Like, this is fake news. And it clicks in my head like I was drawn by FOMo. And because my friend takes me, that I realize, oh, shit, it's probably fake. And I market sell, and then people start selling. It's fake news, fake news, fake news.
00:32:22.060 - 00:32:32.624, Speaker B: And I took the short side. So that was one of the traits that I got very lucky to catch it both ways. If my friend didn't text me that, I would not have realized, I would have stayed left curve.
00:32:35.644 - 00:32:58.234, Speaker A: Yeah, it helps in this space. How do you tend to prefer perform in a bear? I know we've mentioned, like, I think there's just that muscle memory that kicks in and hopefully doesn't spill too much over into the bear where you feel like you need to be constantly on a position. But, like, do you. Okay, do you obviously. Do you sit on your hands and just walk away? Do you go and enjoy yourself for a little bit? Or.
00:32:58.774 - 00:33:27.074, Speaker B: It comes down to that tip I gave earlier that I keep for myself. Ten years leeway outside crypto. The reason for that is that I'm not a very qualified person outside crypto. I must admit I don't have a particularly high degree. Like, I could easily go back to school and learn anything in five years, but I got to put the time to get it because I dropped university to trade crypto. So if. Worst case scenario, that's how I think it.
00:33:27.074 - 00:33:59.554, Speaker B: Worst case scenario, everything collapsed to zero, which is not 0% chance, in my opinion. Although extremely low, I have to be ready to survive for that. And I think ten years is a very safe number to have as a leeway outside of crypto. Obviously, not everyone has that luxury. A couple years, at least two years, I think, is minimum, as I said. But if you have that leeway, you want to be very anxious in the bear, and you will be able to enjoy life. This was the first bear market that I had this leeway in 2022.
00:33:59.554 - 00:34:25.204, Speaker B: It was quite a pleasant experience. I did not over trade. I tried to kind of stay away and just click here and there with very small sight to keep my attention, but I did not over trade this bear market, the previous bear market, I did over trade. I did try to make some money here and there, and I just chased my tail and put myself in the wrong mindset to take advantage when the bull come back. So I think this time I did a lot better.
00:34:26.923 - 00:34:34.463, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Do you participate in private markets at all? Any seed investing or anything along those lines?
00:34:34.963 - 00:35:32.698, Speaker B: I try to do some investments when there's opportunities I try to avoid. I've noticed from being in contact with people doing it, there's some sort of pump and dumps going on sometimes, and I kind of get a better grasp on it. So I try to avoid the very short term coins that have no product going for them. I'm quite bullish on decentralized exchanges, I think decentralized exchange, especially with. I think I heard on Avi podcast he mentioned that the US is kind of quitting its war against crypto, just accepting the ETF and kind of went silent, and that Dexs got hit hard. And I think Dex has very big potential and especially if the US dont go after them, they can grow a lot in the coming years. So I see that as an opportunity in terms of DeXs, in terms of specific project here and there.
00:35:32.698 - 00:35:43.254, Speaker B: Im open to investing, but I wouldnt have as much conviction unless there is a product that I understand the business model.
00:35:44.964 - 00:35:56.344, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. Particularly. Perhaps, perhaps XB is pretty, pretty interesting one. Obviously DyDX go get in their own chain now. I think they've probably underestimated the barrier to entry.
00:35:57.244 - 00:36:02.660, Speaker B: DyDX is overrated compared to many. Dex is like, there's vertex, vertex is.
00:36:02.692 - 00:36:05.620, Speaker A: Great across the cross margin on vertex is vertex even.
00:36:05.692 - 00:36:49.194, Speaker B: I was trading on apex as my, as a Dex, I tried, I tried it and like, the maintenance margins don't make sense on apex to me. And the reason I stopped using Dydx was because I was trying to long some dodge coin, just try around a very small position. And I think I was on ten x leverage and my liquidation price was like 4% apart on ten x leverage. And the reason for that is the maintenance margin is something like 5%. So it's extremely high. And I don't know how that makes financial sense to like, basically, to trade on the YDX, you would need to have a lot of collateral there, and I don't want to put a lot of money on it. So that's why I stopped using it.
00:36:49.194 - 00:37:23.614, Speaker B: The main reason. And I think a lot of good dexs are starting to pop off where you cannot compete with binance or bybit as of today, because centralized exchanges still have a lot more liquidity and a better experience. But eventually it will develop into something competitive, at least little bit. And people don't like to necessarily put money on centralized exchange, and they just want the venue to trade and to have a good experience. So I think that will come eventually, that will be competitive.
00:37:24.434 - 00:37:33.978, Speaker A: We tried any products like Intent X, so it's like a more of a request for court style, perhaps. So it's obviously self custodial.
00:37:34.026 - 00:38:39.854, Speaker B: And then I think it's a good idea. It depends how they execute it and which market maker compete to give the quotations. But the core idea of it, from what I understand, is that you make market maker match the order of users and compete one against the other to give the best quote. And it does make sense. I think it was Jordy Alexander you had on your podcast last time who explained that basically, if they have vip nine on binance futures and they have way better execution than the average user than I could even get. Let's say you want to buy a bunch of litecoin at a given price and you send your quote, then they can buy it for you on binance futures with those better fees than you could ever have and better execution, and they keep a small cut and you still get better than you would if you executed it yourself. So the idea, in principle, I think it's good.
00:38:39.854 - 00:38:56.194, Speaker B: The execution of it will be everything. So I'm quite excited to see how it develops, how the quotations work, and if it's a product that I will adopt permanently in the future, we'll see how it goes.
00:38:56.734 - 00:39:33.572, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the only sticking point currently, and obviously they're just kind of rolling out the product, so there's always going to be room for kind of further development. But I think people are asking for more complex order types, even like just basics stops or maybe like cross margin and stuff like that. So it's going to be interesting. It seems like a really good stopgap in between the shortcomings of maybe an MM style perps decks or even on chain order book style perps decks. And like, as I say, in between that and the centralized exchange. So yeah, looking forward to seeing how that one plays out, I think. Right, last section.
00:39:33.572 - 00:39:54.464, Speaker A: A lot of people liked this one yesterday when we posted with Brian Pellegrino from Layer Zero. There's no right answer to these. It's more of a really fun exercise to see just how your mind works when you ask these questions. So the first one, how many chickens do you think it would take to kill a lion?
00:39:57.444 - 00:39:58.384, Speaker B: Infinite.
00:40:03.804 - 00:40:14.796, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been going back and forth. I think there's going to be a lot that need to be martyrs for that to ever be. I think maybe.
00:40:14.900 - 00:40:18.794, Speaker B: Maybe he will explode from eating too much.
00:40:20.854 - 00:40:35.814, Speaker A: Maybe that's it. Kill him from the inside. So the next one, are there more doors or are there more wheels on earth? The doors are wheels, dolls.
00:40:35.894 - 00:40:37.814, Speaker B: Like a doll, like a door.
00:40:37.854 - 00:40:39.550, Speaker A: Like a door that you walk through.
00:40:39.582 - 00:40:48.454, Speaker B: Oh, door. Yeah, this is a good one. I'll go with wheels.
00:40:51.234 - 00:41:21.234, Speaker A: All right. As I said, no right answer here, Brian. Trying to work out how many daw manufacturing companies that work compared to wheel manufacturing companies the other day. It took them about ten minutes to answer, and then the last one, which I think is the funniest, is, would you rather fight a horse sized duck? So that's a horse size, um, size of a duck or 100 duck sized horses?
00:41:22.254 - 00:41:23.918, Speaker B: A horse sized duck.
00:41:24.006 - 00:41:24.206, Speaker A: You.
00:41:24.230 - 00:41:28.590, Speaker B: You mean like, really a really you got.
00:41:28.662 - 00:41:36.514, Speaker A: Yeah, that. That's where answer. You got a really giant duck. So you get to fight one of those or you get to fight a hundred duck sized horses?
00:41:39.014 - 00:41:50.674, Speaker B: Oh, that's a good one. I would. No weapons.
00:41:51.214 - 00:41:56.234, Speaker A: No weapons. Hands. Hand to hand combat. Hand to hoof combat.
00:41:56.694 - 00:42:01.474, Speaker B: I'll go with 100 duckside horses.
00:42:02.414 - 00:42:07.126, Speaker A: I think you could kick a few of them as well. So, like, get a few of them out the way by kicking, because, like.
00:42:07.150 - 00:42:10.554, Speaker B: The dog, the dog with its beak, it just eats me.
00:42:11.934 - 00:42:13.878, Speaker A: That'd be a pretty big beak as well.
00:42:14.006 - 00:42:21.834, Speaker B: It's not that big, right, but no, I don't know that that's a tough one. I'll go with the hundred tiny horses.
00:42:24.374 - 00:42:31.654, Speaker A: So if anyone listening wants to see that, maybe we could actually crowd fund that and salsa can actually fight 100 ducks.
00:42:32.154 - 00:42:50.654, Speaker B: I don't know how big the neck of that horse sized dock would be. That's a big question. Right, because then you would attack the neck. But can I, can I even harm the neck? I would need to see it. I need the chat GPT to make me a simulation.
00:42:52.114 - 00:43:14.434, Speaker A: Yeah, you could do it on that new sora. You could probably get a 32nd clip of what it would look like. Well, salsa. Thanks so much. I really appreciate all your insight. I'm sure a lot of people have taken a lot from there, particularly if it's their first or second time around in the markets. There's so much wisdom to be taken from there and, yeah, thanks so much for doing this, and, yeah, really appreciate you coming on.
00:43:15.214 - 00:43:17.794, Speaker B: Cheers, man. Thanks for having me.
00:43:18.614 - 00:43:27.334, Speaker A: Very welcome, very welcome. Take it easy, everyone, and we'll speak to you next time. All right, thanks for listening. If you enjoyed the show, please give us a, like, subscribe and turn the notification bell on for next time. See ya.
