00:00:00.320 - 00:00:24.886, Speaker A: Alright, just a quick one before we get going. So please don't take anything you hear in today's episode as financial advice. Please speak to a trained professional if you do wish to participate in markets. Crypto is inherently risky and you will lose all your money, particularly if you listen to us for financial direction. So enough of that. Please give us a like subscribe, enjoy the show and see you next time. Welcome back.
00:00:24.886 - 00:00:31.618, Speaker A: Another episode of still early. Today's guest needs absolutely no introduction, so I'm not going to waste my time and yours doing that. Sue, how's it going?
00:00:31.746 - 00:00:33.650, Speaker B: Very good. How about you? Thanks for having me.
00:00:33.802 - 00:00:41.374, Speaker A: Yeah, very good. Very good. I like your nice serenic background. First time I went to Japan in November and I can't. So picked it up place.
00:00:42.074 - 00:00:43.106, Speaker B: It's a great place.
00:00:43.250 - 00:00:48.574, Speaker A: And how's Kyle doing? I see he's on his kind of lumberjack arc at the minute. He's just chopping wood on Twitter.
00:00:49.234 - 00:01:04.666, Speaker B: Yeah, I think he's exploring the great outdoors. He's getting a lot of good advice actually from the comments. It's actually really funny because half of them would be like, what are you doing? And the other half of like, no, your technique is all wrong. You got to cut it. Like, he's been improving a lot.
00:01:04.690 - 00:01:10.490, Speaker A: Actually, I was just in. Let's give you the right answer. I think what's, what's the Cunningham's law?
00:01:10.562 - 00:01:16.974, Speaker B: Cunningham's law, yeah, exactly. Cunningham's law. Someone will teach you by doing if you do it wrong.
00:01:18.354 - 00:01:44.848, Speaker A: So for people who listen, I'm just going to chat some markets. I've got a few um, kind of selfish questions of how position in the market and what kind of what Sue's take on what's happening in our recent as well. So gonna get in all that good stuff. Got some stupid questions at the end as people have came to know and like from this episode. Um, but yeah, we'll get into it. And um. So 1st, 1st off, I've been thinking about this a lot recently.
00:01:44.848 - 00:02:02.956, Speaker A: I think I've heard you speak about it on a podcast as well. But re halving in relative terms to where we are on bitcoin, close to all time high. What the hell is happening? Like are we compressing a cycle? Like where's your head up?
00:02:02.980 - 00:02:50.806, Speaker B: That? I mean, I think we're much closer to all time highs than a lot of people expected. But I don't think it means that it's a compressed cycle. Actually. I think it doesn't really make that much sense for that because I think you know, part of it can be that we need, let's say, a much longer cycle this time, because the cycles are kind of getting longer over time as well, in some bases. So I feel like if you think about the bull market having re begun in, let's say, early 2023, we're kind of already in a longer cycle. And I think that, you know, with the ETF flows, these are very unlikely to be one way. I mean, these are very unlikely to reverse that quickly.
00:02:50.806 - 00:03:19.286, Speaker B: But. But that depends a little bit on macro. So I would say I'm definitely not a believer in short cycle theory because I just think that this cycle, people have seen that crypto is here to stay, right? They've seen some extreme stuff happen in 2022, and it's kind of here to stay. A lot of the older folks in trad five that I talked to these days, they, you know, they just really respect the resilience of the asset class. And they say, well, I already have seen what happens when that happens, and that happens, and I'm not actually very scared. I'll just buy the dip next time. And, you know, they buy the dip now.
00:03:19.286 - 00:03:56.790, Speaker B: So I feel like that, in a way, has created a big Lindy effect in crypto. And also, just like the percentage allocations of older people, I think, has gone a lot higher. I mean, I was at a dinner where I think the average allocation was 15% to 20%, and these are people over 50, over 40. And so I think that, you know, it's something where people are just very comfortable with the price action. They know the chart well, they know the levels, so they're kind of, you know, you know, this one guy said, you know, this is less volatile than Nvidia, so I don't really think of it as particularly much more risky. And they kind of get the. I think people get the value proposition more cleanly now.
00:03:56.790 - 00:04:29.624, Speaker B: I think almost everyone at a certain, you know, cognizant level, they can now explain to you what is bitcoin, what is ethereum, whereas that was not true last cycle. So I think that the pure on ramps and inflows, that that creates this kind of much stronger supply shock than normally would be pre having. Pre having. You would normally see a little bit of minor, um, issues, possibly like a dip into it, but this cycle, you haven't seen that. I think that's caught a lot of ogs off guard because they're like, well, usually we get a dip into having, uh, here. We haven't yet, despite funding me really high. So I think that that's been very unique.
00:04:30.244 - 00:05:01.344, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an odd one, isn't it? Like, my parents, even my grandparents, like, he's. He's been, like, dabbling. He's getting more and more comfortable what it is. And like, if you'd asked him, like, five years ago, it's just like, might have seen it come across, like, Bloomberg on tv and stuff like that. But he never, never thought it was anything, like, worth of interest. But now he's just, like, so ingrained in it. My dad sending me, well, he sent me some complete degenerate shit as well, that he's fine across the Solana ecosystem.
00:05:01.344 - 00:05:20.180, Speaker A: Yeah. Like pictures of him with his hat on and stuff like that. But yeah, there's definitely. I seen all the pitches from East Denver this week. Like, all the Uber drivers going around accepting tips and just feels like just part of. I don't know, I'm just part of general culture across the globe at the minute.
00:05:20.372 - 00:05:21.744, Speaker B: For sure. For sure.
00:05:23.364 - 00:05:36.944, Speaker A: What are you thinking about seeing some of the polymarket prices for EFTF? Do you think that's getting baked in, or do you think that's just following bitcoin at present?
00:05:37.524 - 00:06:01.160, Speaker B: I think ethwab will form a lot. That's one of my main thesis for the next few months. Um, I think that, um, it won't go above, like, when I say a lot, I still don't mean, like over 0.08, but so, so take that with a grain of salt. But I think that, you know, Eth definitely lagged bitcoin. It's been a bitcoin led bull market for the most part. But, um, you know, like, ETF will open up a lot of inflows.
00:06:01.160 - 00:06:42.484, Speaker B: Uh, and I think that the best argument I've heard is that SEC will approve it because they don't want to get sued when they don't approve it, and they'll have to approve it anyways, so they might as well just prove it now. I think that's a reasonable argument. I've heard that from some smart people. I don't know any better than them. So the market seems to be pricing not that much in, because ETH versus bitcoin is not that, you know, it's not that high. I do think that, you know, if we get an ETF, we may see a general rotation from the new money that came in to buy bitcoin ETF to ether ETF, because some of these people may have bought bitcoin ETF because that's the only ETF. Then when there's ether ETF.
00:06:42.484 - 00:07:17.924, Speaker B: If they don't have too much of a capital gains issue, they may sell some bitcoin ETF to buy ether ETF. So that will also be some rotational flows. Thus far, the cycle, you've seen almost no rotational flows from bitcoin to ether. Just because bitcoin are pretty confident in the ecosystem right now, they're pretty confident in ordinal stuff is really going off. It's just a ton of activity happening, having sailor buying every dip, you know, nation states buying, so they haven't had much reason to rotate yet. And I think that's part of the reason why, you know, it's really only traders that have been playing the 0.05 level, just because it's a very basic technical level.
00:07:17.924 - 00:07:45.764, Speaker B: And you can see in the order books, too, when, whenever it gets close, people just put in bids and they just click it, and then, you know, it gets filled and then it goes up. We saw the same thing in the bear market in 2019 where it's like 0.02 people just put in huge bids on binance at BTC, and they just get filled and then it bounces off like 100% at some point. So something similar will happen this time as well, because the ETH supply shock is very extreme, and it's only made more extreme by Eigen layer. So that's kind of my broad view.
00:07:47.304 - 00:07:59.248, Speaker A: And do you think there'd ever be a time where you'd actually be able to bake in staking to a product that's on Wall street and, like, who, who are the main benefactors?
00:07:59.296 - 00:08:25.016, Speaker B: If so, that's a tough question. I mean, I think maybe not in the first year. I think it depends on the regulatory regime, because there is risk in staking. I don't know how to calculate that for the, you know, for the products. I think that you might get something where they can buy a wrap product. Maybe like you, you could have an ECF that gets approved, but I don't think you can have giant ETF stake. I just think it's a danger for the consensus as well.
00:08:25.016 - 00:08:57.880, Speaker B: I mean, restaking in general if it gets too big, it's a little bit of a consensus issue. I think it's a little bit of a technical issue, but I think at the current sizes, it doesn't really matter. So you may not want an entire ETF staking either. It just seems like there's some risk there. I'm not that technical on that, but that's how it feels. But I do think that yield products are only going to more and more come out. I think that in general, if you think about the ETF's they have in tradfi, they're pretty djen, you've got like three x volatility products.
00:08:57.880 - 00:09:32.872, Speaker B: You've got like five x ball. I mean, five x volatility products. Stuff that goes to zero, like every month, and it goes to zero again the next month. Right? This stuff that, the reason why this stuff gets approved is because the banks are the counterparties to the retail on this. So they're like, of course you're gonna get approved. And they pitch it as like, well, it's like it's a crash risk. Even though, you know, VxX goes to zero over the long term and you're trading as banks, who cares, right? Like, so from that point of view, if we get a, especially if you get like, you know, Trump presidency, you get laissez faire policy, you could see a lot of really weird ETF's come out, I think Andrew Coney that tweet, like, you know, people are not pricing the doge ETF.
00:09:32.872 - 00:10:11.694, Speaker B: You know, it's absolutely true, because the doge is POW. Fair launch. Why can't you have an ETF on doge if you have one on bitcoin? I don't see any reason you could have bitcoin cash ETF, have a litecoin ETF. These are all etfable. At the end of the day, anything can be ETF just a matter of what people buy it or not, right? So eventually, I think the ETF pump will stop because you can make ecfs on, you know, there are ecfs on many, many different things, but eventually people just say, okay, the fact that there's ETF on it does not mean that anyone will buy it, right? Whereas right now, people do demand that access products. That's why you see ETF pumps, because there's a lot of money that would buy bitcoin in ethereum if it could with, you know, retirement money or with like, you know, stocks rotate from stocks into crypto. So.
00:10:12.614 - 00:10:42.494, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. So also seeing options open interest all time high. I know you guys been, I think your investors in durability, if I'm not mistaken, they're absolutely killing at the minute. Why is it just market becoming more familiar with bitcoin and ethereum options? Like, why are we seeing all time high this time when we're at basically price parity to all time highs? And it's probably like 50% higher than open interest last time around?
00:10:43.794 - 00:11:18.884, Speaker B: I think options adoption was kind of our, one of our big theses last cycle. And it didn't actually play out as big as, as bigly as I thought it would be, just because I think it was still not that much institutional adoption compared to where it should have been. But this cycle, I think, you know, you've got a lot of interest on people. Uh, you know, see me, um, block trades on, you know, I think the FTX state even said, like, they're going to use options to hedge. They're going to use stuff to hedge. So I think that, I think the traditional finance guys are more active and that naturally the client base likes options. They like selling them, they like buying them.
00:11:18.884 - 00:11:54.276, Speaker B: I don't see the sense that retail is trading many options still on crypto, but I think that will change over time. There's still a product market fit for altcoin options, but they're just hard to market make. But I think that will happen. I think Defi Options has been one of those things which is the perpetual holy grail that no one ever builds because it's just too hard. Ribbon got closest, I think, last cycle, but it ended up being just not a great product because it's a passive product. You're selling covered calls, you're going to underperform a lot, you're going to do all this. That's not the greatest product.
00:11:54.276 - 00:12:05.412, Speaker B: But I do think that something could come out of that this cycle. I think options are huge in the traditional markets. TeSla options trade more than entire countries.
00:12:05.508 - 00:12:14.560, Speaker A: Volumes wasn't like Robinhood's main products that brought everyone in. Options, like when everyone was just djing, live things away.
00:12:14.592 - 00:12:36.668, Speaker B: And during COVID Yeah, GME options was a big gamma squeeze thing because essentially, you know, people, anything that's shorted enough, you can pump it because you just buy a bunch and then you, and then people, you know, in certain communities, they can say, guys, people are short, let's squeeze. And that narrative is always very populist because the long short funds are the ones who are shorting stock.
00:12:36.716 - 00:13:13.486, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, there's lot of really good, really smart teams building, particularly in defi options space, but it just never seems to, like, catch on. It's like more of an end of cycle. People are like, oh, this might actually run like the ribbon team, the Lyra team. I know there's like a few new products that are kind of using. It is like protected perps to like Trojan Horse people to get them to use options and like make a familiar setting for them. But I think as soon as people realize like you had some super leverage on them, they might be interested. But I don't know.
00:13:13.486 - 00:13:19.194, Speaker A: I think the muscle memory for people to go directly to, perhaps particularly on chain, I think it's going to be a hard one shift.
00:13:20.094 - 00:13:55.340, Speaker B: Yeah, it still may happen. I mean, I think part of it is regulatory as well. Like, you know, the, the best product would be like binary options. But obviously if you do binary options, you may face some regulatory risk there because there was a wave of these binary options in FX back in the day, and they're doing really well, making lots of money. And then governments really don't like binary options because they're like, this is just pure gambling, so there's more team risk there. I think when you go into that part of the market, I think a very simple product, like an up or down product, I've seen some smaller exchanges do, and that does well in their own local market. So, you know, but they probably don't want to advertise too loud.
00:13:55.340 - 00:14:17.370, Speaker B: They just want to offer, you know, it's like a sports bookie almost. It's like you don't need to shot from the rooftop. You're doing it. You know, like, you know, you make, you make some markets, you, you make people, you let people gamble. I think that, that people do do, but we haven't seen a mass adoption options protocol. Um, you know, the, the best one almost might be like a lottery style system. You get everyone enjoying it just because you give it like a huge airdrop to everyone who like, buys one call or something.
00:14:17.370 - 00:14:35.254, Speaker B: And then, you know, if you put some names behind it, it would not be a bad idea. Uh, like a pool together slash, like premium touch type concept, but it's just a lot of work. And then, you know, I think. I think there's always a lower hanging fruit. I think it's just a little bit too much work for Defi, always.
00:14:35.914 - 00:14:48.614, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say. So how much are you paying attention to what's happening on top of bitcoin? So there's some absolute degenerate nfts flying around. I've spent way too much money on the past couple of days.
00:14:49.194 - 00:15:13.646, Speaker B: Yeah, BRC 20. I pay attention to a decent amount. One of the early investors in Aux is David Bailey. His partner did a podcast with Kyle. But they are, I think, the earliest buyer of ordinals in the west by a long shot. Does Bitcoin magazine, Bitcoin conference. I think in the beginning phase, ordinals is really controversial because it's like, should this be allowed or not? But obviously you can't stop it.
00:15:13.646 - 00:15:35.570, Speaker B: And the chinese market, I think, is really, really hot on ordinals because it's like, you know, it's a very low ease of deployment because anyone can launch these. It's not. You don't. It doesn't take much that much work like ERC 20, comparatively. A little bit harder to launch your own ERC 20, but, you know, inscription is very easy to launch your own. So I think that's cool. Bitcoin L2.
00:15:35.570 - 00:15:48.910, Speaker B: I'm so not sure if any of these are real L2s. I don't know if I've seen any that are really L2s yet. They call themselves L2s. I don't know. I think it's a big meme for sure. Yeah, I don't know. Like ZK L2.
00:15:48.910 - 00:15:54.634, Speaker B: Starcore type stuff. Could be cool, I think. Yeah, we'll see.
00:15:55.054 - 00:16:18.680, Speaker A: Yeah, there's. Well, I've seen. Not going to name any names, but some of them came to market with very coordinated red attack for everyone to go and kind of purchase the token and that didn't end very well. And then salvage. It was cool of Mario and people on spaces, which. Yeah, but yeah, there's a lot of vaporware. We're trying to, like, collate a report internally of like, what the latest happens now.
00:16:18.680 - 00:16:38.368, Speaker A: There's only like one or two that we found of worth assault, to be honest. But it's interesting. Unless I'm kind of like, happy there's something happening on there and I know there's the argument for it should just do one thing and one thing. Well, I can kind of get that outrage, but at the same time, I can also appreciate the innovation that's happening there.
00:16:38.496 - 00:17:03.392, Speaker B: I think it's important. I mean, long term, people used to complain about bitcoin fees not being high enough. Eventually, I think now there's a lot less concern. I mean, maybe half of it was genuine concern. Half of it was like, the community pointing out that they have more activity than bitcoin. And I think now it's kind of almost equalized a bit because the bitcoin fees are actually really high sometimes to the point you're probably not going to use it for payments on l one ever again. But it does say, okay.
00:17:03.392 - 00:17:22.536, Speaker B: And it's kind of a natural argument, too, which is that given there's so much wealth in the community, if they need to pay some fees to some miners to do some stuff, they'll figure it out. Right. Like, it's. People will protect their own interests. So I think that's one reason, too. Like, a lot of the miners really support ordinals and BRC 20 in the beginning because they say, well, this is awesome. In the long run, we're going to have a halving.
00:17:22.536 - 00:17:29.128, Speaker B: So let's get people to do stuff because they essentially earn from the fees from all that activity, right?
00:17:29.296 - 00:18:15.904, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly, exactly. So again, something that feels, like, very pulled forward in a, quote, unquote, cycle is just, we've had this incredible explosion of meme coins. And when they cycle began to kind of come back and you had stuff like bonk and Pepe, and Pepe was a little bit earlier, but like, bonk and whiff and things like that have ran and people like, yeah, it's just getting a bit frothy. Markets aren't going to go anywhere after this, but that usually comes tail end of some majors moving. But, like, that's kind of been pulled forward. And I can't really wrap my head why that is. I don't know if it's like people using them as lottery tickets or whatever have you.
00:18:15.904 - 00:18:19.884, Speaker A: But it feels. Feels a little bit different this time around.
00:18:20.224 - 00:18:59.514, Speaker B: Does it? Does. Every time it's different. You know, when people say it's always the same as whatever, like, no man walks into the same river twice. Right? So, like, here, I definitely think that people have learned from the last cycle, which is that, wait, you can get stupidly rich from, like, meme coins, right? Because everyone knows someone who they think is, you know, not. Not very clever, but made a lot of money on meme coins. So this cycle, people, when they hear about it from your, like, now, I'm at the point now where, like, if someone tells you about a meme coin, you almost have to pascal, wager for something, because if you don't, and then it goes up a lot, you never hear the end of it. And you also will feel like, why did I just buy, like, you know, some amount? Right? So that that effect is happening around the world right now.
00:18:59.514 - 00:19:40.114, Speaker B: So, uh, because unlike, you know, let's say, a tech thesis, the other guy can say, well, I don't understand that, so I'm not gonna buy it here. They can be like, well, I understand it's a dog. And my friend just bought it, and he, you know, he might be richer than me if I don't buy a suit. So they have to catch up at buying it. Um, so that virality is extremely powerful, especially because bitcoin ether almost looks too expensive for a lot of retail now. They will still buy it, you know, the ones that are a little bit more conservative, but the ones who are, let's say, trying to, you know, make their way up or they, you know, do crypto more casually meme coins kind of, they feel more fair to them even though it's not. I mean, I'd argue that they're not actually that much more fair than, let's say, some of the other coins.
00:19:40.114 - 00:20:17.072, Speaker B: But you know, there's an assumption that there's no vc in them, assumption there's no unlocks happening and like dumping, there's no like weird price action type stuff. It's just like, you know, um, very, very clean. So I think that that has a lot of attraction to the man on the street. There's a man on the street, uh, you know, he doesn't want to be trading, let's say the EIp news with like the VC's, but he doesn't, you know, he, he doesn't have a view on like that kind of stuff, but he is happy to buy a dog coin that his friend, you know, he look at, you know, he can chart it and be like, okay, I think it can triple here. Why not?
00:20:17.168 - 00:21:12.640, Speaker A: So, yeah, I put in like we release a kind of market outlook at the beginning of each year and this, in this year round. I just looked at Pepe seemed to have bring in a lot of the NFT crowd that usually like poo pooed, like the idea of tokens. And I think some of them got fucking mega rich or maybe back all back down and now they're doing all right again. But I've just thought about the idea of NFTs on boarded so many people that last time around it was really, really easy. It's well getting past the kind of obscurity of it. It's an NFT, it's a picture, it can go up in value and it feels like this time around you've kind of meme coins and the shitcoin space are just completely stealing that onboarding tool. And people now have the ability to go and sell maybe half of it, or they can go and sell 90% of it if they want and then hold onto it and then they can actually chart as you previous mentioned.
00:21:12.640 - 00:21:16.844, Speaker A: But like that's the kind of gateway drug for new users coming in as well.
00:21:18.064 - 00:21:47.610, Speaker B: Definitely. And I think also just from a market structure perspective, like for the ogs in the space too, like they, it's much easier to get like meme coin traction, let's say, than to, let's say you build a normal product, you got to like, launchpad it. You got to, like, get it listed everywhere. You give away 10% supply each time you get it listed. You know, you have to do all this stuff. There's a lot of work, right. Uh, comparatively, a meme coin, you know, activity, launching one is.
00:21:47.610 - 00:22:24.376, Speaker B: Is a lot, a lot less work. It's a lot more creativity, I would say, but it's less work. So I think people will always be launching them. And because of that, uh, proliferation of meme coins, like, you would think that it detracts from all the original ones, but I think it enhances, because I think it's, you know, each meme coin that kind of makes it out of the spotlight or makes it into the spotlight, and it's like, you know, up a 10,000 x or something that just gives people the hope that, okay, well, I can buy a 10,000 x. I can buy 9999 coins, and if a one goes 10,000 x, I'm still even. Right? So. Which is true, but just very hard to do because how are you going to do it? You know, like, during 2017, it's like icos.
00:22:24.376 - 00:22:47.300, Speaker B: It's like, I had friends who, like, put in. Into every single ICO because they're like, it's just plus ev. Why was you not put in every ICO? Why would you read anything? Right? So that's what it feels like with meme coins now, which is like, anytime, you know, the snipers, anything gets launched on ERC 20, the fees are high, so all the snipers be like, well, you have to buy it because it's plus ev. Like, so you can just launch stuff. You can probably game the bots because they just like, well, we'll snipe it. You can just, like, not. Not do anything.
00:22:47.300 - 00:23:00.300, Speaker B: But of course, you know, it's. It's these bots because they're making money, because once in a while, they snipe something, and they make, like, you know, 300 x or something. And that pays for the nine, you know, the 90 other ones where they just, like, got rugged.
00:23:00.412 - 00:23:19.584, Speaker A: So can you remember that guy's dog spreadsheet from last cycle like that in practice, exactly what he did. And he was like, oh, I think it's like three pages or some shit. And he was just a ridiculous amount. I just pray and scraping.
00:23:20.164 - 00:23:20.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:22.764 - 00:23:55.404, Speaker A: So I seen your portfolio tweets. Yeah, portfolio tweets yesterday, and I was extremely happy that I seen our weave in there. That's super, super duper hyper parallel AI computer. They did some great brandon and buzzword thing the other day. But aside from that, there was another couple of interesting ones. Maker. Can you expand on Maker? And I know interviewed Roon in Singapore last year.
00:23:55.404 - 00:23:59.940, Speaker A: Got extremely bullish after just speaking to that guy. Because I think he's a. I think he's.
00:23:59.972 - 00:24:06.316, Speaker B: Yeah, I think he. The. The aggressive. I think the. I mean, obviously rune is a very OG founder. He's very good. I think he's very motivated as well.
00:24:06.316 - 00:24:23.564, Speaker B: I think there was a period where Maker was kind of, you know, poo pooed on as like Defi layer. Like the, you know, it never pumps kind of thing. But you know, the good thing is that the VBC is. Yeah, you know, the VC's exited around 1000, I believe. So that's really bullish. Well, a lot of people think when VC's sell, it's bearish. It's absolutely not bearish.
00:24:23.564 - 00:25:04.662, Speaker B: It's actually very bullish. You know, the same thing happened in like Solana, for instance, at a dollar, the same thing happened in many coins. So I think that that's from a supply point of view, it's just bullish. I think from the point of view of like, cash flows, it's one of the better ones that you can, you know, buy. I think also from the point of view of narrative, I mean, they. They have a lot of room to do stuff this cycle. I think that SDI a little bit steam taken away by Athena type products, which are just have their own risk profiles, but they're gonna be higher yield, but that won't last forever.
00:25:04.662 - 00:25:33.906, Speaker B: And I also think that there's potential actually for maker to do the same product. I don't know if people realize this, but many people, they put in their ETH and they borrow Dai. It's not the same as Athena. It's actually very similar. Right. I don't know if they'll do that, but I mean, I generally think that it's undervalued by quite a bit if you look at just from all time highs basis and also from the team quality. And moreover, I think that this cycle, you have to own the stuff that is a little bit out of the mainstream if you want better returns.
00:25:33.906 - 00:26:06.584, Speaker B: I think that Lido is a great example of everyone loved it, but then it's not really outperforming. ETH beta plays generally not outperforming. And part of the reason is because it's a little bit over owned, a little bit like Defi after a certain point last cycle, where it's just like people all own it for the outperformance. So then whenever underperforms, people capitulate it back to ETh. Capitulate it back to ETH. So I think that a lot of coins will not be that easy in the ETH ecosystem to outperform ETH, but I think that maker probably could. I think ribbon is also.
00:26:06.584 - 00:26:34.314, Speaker B: It's going to do the evo switch. So I think when you buy ribbon, you get evo, you get two month lock. But I think that, like, among Defi perks, I think evil is one of the stronger ones. I think it's. I mean, I think it's just a very strong core product. I also think that, you know, people want to trade on Defi perp Dexs in the future, generally speaking, because they don't have to KYC. They can, you know, move money on and off chain very quickly.
00:26:34.314 - 00:26:47.808, Speaker B: I think that there's still a ways to go on, like ui ux, like mobile, especially that kind of stuff, because a shocking large percentage of, like, korean market versus chase on mobile. But I think that'll all come.
00:26:47.896 - 00:27:08.084, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, I'm five six, three hour head of research is gonna laugh here and say that, because I bring up mobile first all the time, like a little bit too much because I'm based out in Asia and I got to see her firsthand. And I keep saying this to founders when I'm on interviews, and he's just like, shut up. You just, like, show up. You just keep saying the same thing.
00:27:08.864 - 00:27:13.020, Speaker B: People don't have laptops, they just don't own them. I mean, it's so, yeah, there's a few.
00:27:13.052 - 00:27:42.884, Speaker A: There's a few really good pub stacks products. I like vertex. I don't know. I think DyDX is obviously the king. I don't know what the movement over to its own network has looked like from a volume perspective, if that's increased friction for people getting over there. But again, when you said pep text, that's where everyone thinks. I've seen intent x recently, more of a RFQ like, intent style protocol.
00:27:42.884 - 00:28:16.292, Speaker A: And then I obviously seen the hyper liquid issue the other day, which I still don't know if they've made an announcement about, but yeah, the space is there. It's just, as you say, the UI UX for a lot of people, and I still don't think a lot of people have just tried it out and give it a go, because I prefer keeping infinite on chain, personally, and sometimes flips people's head and they don't get it. But I just like having access, easy access to absolutely everything, as opposed to like going over to a centralized exchange, I'm like, it's a pain in the ass to get there.
00:28:16.388 - 00:28:44.980, Speaker B: Absolutely agree. I think mobile is so key because if you think about the average like binance trader, they're trading on mobile a lot, even when they don't. Like, they may enter the position on their like desktop or laptop, but they'll check it on their phone. So PPM wants to like easily check on your phone, close it, you know, send more money in. I think the space is still lacking because right now it's still very much like the webpage where you like the wallet sign in. Most sites are not that optimized for mobile.
00:28:45.012 - 00:29:19.744, Speaker A: I feel there's definitely infrastructure there with privy that if you did the frontech sign up procedure, that was back end infrastructure for that. But again, I just think it's probably overlooked and a lot of people should be focused on it if they want to get in the hands of a lot more people. I think, I don't know, we'll have to kind of see on your portfolio thoughts as well. Worldcoin has been absolutely killing it, absolutely smashing it. But Sam Altman saying he wants to raise 7 trillion, it's good for the market.
00:29:20.324 - 00:29:46.186, Speaker B: That's right, that's right. Yeah. I mean, I think he's basically, it's like a social token, right? It's kind of his social token. And he doesn't own equity and open AI, so people can say, well, this is his thing. And I mentioned this on a previous podcast, but it's like he benefits far more from it being a really high price than from being able to crystallize it. Because if he sells it, what is he going to buy? He can't buy anything that he cares about that much anyways. He can also raise easily, so he doesn't need to sell to buy anything.
00:29:46.186 - 00:30:30.548, Speaker B: But if the value is really high at world coin, and that is a really good prestige factor for him, and I think that it's good for the overall thing. So I think that that's, it's a little bit like what SPF did with FCT, but just better executed because he also understood that if your exchange token is a high price, then people, it's like a bank stock. If your bank stock is high, then the bank seems safe, the bank stock is low, the bank seems dangerous. That is that baked in reflexivity, even without any more layers of reflexivity. And obviously if you can use FTT to trade with, and it's like the second layer of reflexivity, which is that someone's implicitly lending to FTT. When you're allowed to trade with FTT, everyone who put non FTT on the exchange is lending to the people who put FTT on it. Right.
00:30:30.548 - 00:31:12.976, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's a little bit like that, I think, where you have that effect where you know, and that's where you always want to look for these reflexivity loops where if the price is higher, then the, you know, price leads narrative. I always explain this, like, to, like, traders before, but like, you have to think of once the prices go up, then what will the new narrative be then? Like, don't think, like, what. What is the narrative now? Because that's based on what the price is now as well. Like, just close your eyes, wake up tomorrow and the price is higher, what do you then think? So people want to explain what happened. So I think world coins, very example, I mean, they have great traction, they have a million daus, I think. I can't remember the exact number. But also it's an ambitious thing where it's not that easy to put your hand up and say, I'm going to do one.
00:31:12.976 - 00:31:23.322, Speaker B: Also, it takes some lead time, it takes some distribution. So I think it'll have that kind of effect. It'll have that halo effect for some time. Yeah.
00:31:23.338 - 00:31:56.146, Speaker A: I think the orbs are quite expensive to make, so no one's going to, as we were saying earlier, like this, you can quite easily go and fork a lot of protocols that are existing in this landscape now. No one's going to go fork wellcoin. Yeah, I was saying. Can't remember speaking about this too. Yeah, he's just going to create another dot coin instead. Are you looking into any of it? AI or deep in stuff? I know it's a kind of wild west and it's a bit of a landing curve for me, particularly on the AI side as well.
00:31:56.170 - 00:32:46.344, Speaker B: It's a wild west. It's a wild west for sure. I mean, I'm not an AI specialist at all, so, I mean, I think for me, just learning some basics the last few months. But I think that it reminds me a little bit of 2017, honestly, because I think you're trying to get like white paper style pumps where there's no AI used yet, but it's like pumping because it's got AI in it. So I think that's not that sustainable, in my opinion, because ultimately the people who do that, they know that as well. So it's hard to get that final buyer in. Also, because I think retail may not actually buy AI tokens as much as they buy, like, meme coins, because AI buy an AI coin, if you're pure retail, it'll be actually a little bit scary because, like, what if I bought the wrong way? Like, what if I bought the wrong coin, right? So I think that I'd say I'm not as bullish on, like, buying a basket of AI coins, like, like small caps as some of my friends are.
00:32:46.344 - 00:33:12.544, Speaker B: But, you know, I think that bit tensor is interesting. I've been trying to understand it a lot better. One of my traders, before he actually went and started a bit tensor project. So I think that whenever I see young people build stuff that I'm like, okay, now I'm going to look because that takes some effort, right? Just buying the coin is no effort, but if you're actually building on it, okay, then you have to look and see what's going on.
00:33:12.724 - 00:33:49.028, Speaker A: We did like a Solana deep in AI report, and what our head of research came back with was there's so much like dog shit, but then there's, then there's also some shit that is going to market. But as you were saying, for you coming in buying retail, you're getting those AI price tags as well. And I always kind of think the best way to kind of grow community, whether you're like, wanting to be a top 50 project or an ecosystem, is you gotta leave a little bit of meat on the bone to allow people to get slightly rich and go and sing your praise.
00:33:49.076 - 00:33:49.956, Speaker B: Yes, agree.
00:33:50.140 - 00:33:53.544, Speaker A: Yeah, and I don't think a lot of them are allowing that.
00:33:53.844 - 00:34:05.104, Speaker B: Absolutely agree. I've seen some stuff that's kind of interesting just conceptually where you do the world coin concept, but you do, for instance, like proof of gamer, right? So you just say prove you're a human in some other way. So they have a gaming network.
00:34:05.764 - 00:34:10.700, Speaker A: So you niche that down into one specific product. Does that make sense?
00:34:10.852 - 00:34:37.482, Speaker B: Yeah. So for instance, if they already have the distribution, let's say they already have like, you know, millions of web, two users for some game. Or it's like game networks, you know, you could do something like, you know, by doing these actions on a game. And, you know, you link your steam account, then you prove you're a real gamer. And then I give you a token like that. That's a good way to give people some free money. And then they may come in like, you know, because that at least has a value prop because you could say, okay, then web3 games can come and airdrop these guys money and get them to play their game.
00:34:37.482 - 00:35:11.164, Speaker B: That's not a bad workflow. I think you can see that across a lot of horizontal type business models where it's very. B, two c. Customer acquisition arbitrage tokens are essentially arbitraging customer acquisition costs, because normally when you give away money, you don't really get it back. Whereas in crypto, when you give people tokens, you have this weird thing where people may buy more of it. Whereas if you give people free uber rides, they could buy more Uber rides, but they won't buy more uber stock, but here they buy more of the actual underlying. So that's a bit of a flywheel.
00:35:11.164 - 00:35:35.314, Speaker B: I think world coins benefit from that flywheel because anyone who gets some world coin, you know, if only 1% of them say, you know, I'm gonna buy more, it's kind of cool like that. That's like enough to. To keep the flywheel going. So I think definitely looking for stuff where that. That's a similar type flywheel. But yeah, gaming is an interesting one because, you know, the onboarding of users is a really hard problem. Wallets kind of stuff.
00:35:35.314 - 00:35:37.138, Speaker B: So, yeah, a lot of the gaming.
00:35:37.186 - 00:36:11.058, Speaker A: Stuff, I've, like, we had shrapnel on here. We had off the grid. There's a couple of others, like, they seem to have got the onboarding experience down to a t. The wallet sign up process is gone through your Google account. Are you going through your Apple account? Like, games aren't gonna fuck around? Like, on Metamask? So, like, I think people in the industry have got a bit of a sour taste. Yeah, got a bit of a sour taste in the mouth of what the first iteration of, like, quote unquote game fight was. I'll call that web3 gaming or whatever.
00:36:11.058 - 00:36:50.356, Speaker A: And then. But I think it's gonna catch a lot of people by surprise because I think there's a lot of really, really, really good teams that are building that space. But again, it's a really difficult one to get right on the token balance and the actual token syncs in a game to make it worthwhile of an investment, particularly if you're getting it in public markets. So just another one on customer acquisition cost. Do you think this points matter and airdrop farming phrases is going to be staying around?
00:36:50.540 - 00:37:27.840, Speaker B: I don't actually think so. I think the points meta is actually a stealth ICo. I think if you think about it, it's an ICo to your users. So they're basically like. It's like you go to a restaurant and then you pay like ten times more for a burger than you should. But you're, like, mining the shares of the restaurant, right? So you're just eating tons of burgers that you wouldn't normally eat. You know, you're paying like $1,000 per burger, and then at the end of it, like, I hope this restaurants share, someone will buy, right? So in the case of Friendtech, I think they took the farming meta way too far, and they're just, like, really focused on farming, which is a shame because I actually was kind of bullish on it in the beginning.
00:37:27.840 - 00:38:12.164, Speaker B: Like, I tweeted a bit about it and I used it. I thought it was, like, a good way to form communities. I think the x squared bonding curve is obviously very, very dangerous because people are going to buy the top and lose a bunch of money. But I thought the core idea was good. I was surprised by how quickly it just became, you know, because when the points meta is too strong, then you actually lose the initial product and you don't even know if it's good. You kind of, like, don't know how to iterate because you're just like, people are coming in and farming, right? That kind of is. And I think the actually, the creation of accounts which were created to specifically farm it were really bearish for they actually should have banned those if they were really thinking about it closely because there were some accounts where, like, know, you buy mine, I buy yours, and then I give away all my revenue from future points back to you.
00:38:12.164 - 00:38:51.274, Speaker B: Like, that sounds innovative at first, and it brings up capital, but then you look at the top ten lists and it's all like, just these kinds of accounts, and then you're just like, as if you're a new user. You're like, everything is to farm the thing, right? So that I think, you know, I think it's, who knows? Like, it may have a, like a small revival, I'm not sure. But that, that is, I think, a good example. I think points make sense if you want people to not to not know the value of what they're farming. But the question is, why do you want to not know it? Right? So there's two reasons why you might want them to not know it. One is you want them to overpay for it, and then they eat the burgers, and then they're just like, okay, I'm just fat now. I don't have any money, and then the restaurant closes down.
00:38:51.274 - 00:39:17.864, Speaker B: The second could be that they would do it anyways, and you give them the points that way, and that's much better if they would do the activity anyways. And you're giving them points, and it's more like a launch pool. Like Eigen layer at points I can tolerate because it's more like a launch pool. It's like an EtH launch pool. And people get together and they say, we're all smart, we're all early, so we get these points, and then we enjoy them when they launch. And it's like the end product is a thing. It's a data availability.
00:39:17.864 - 00:39:57.258, Speaker B: Play can be valued versus Celestia. It can be like 10 billion fTV. So that kind of makes more sense because, you know, you might put it in re staking anyways, and then you're simply getting rewarded for being part of the network. I think it's good for bootstrapping those kind of staking networks. I think that if you look at even perp Dexs, though, like points systems. Like point systems basically allow the team to do whatever the hell they want, right? Like they can at any point say, you know, I'm gonna do like ten times, boost 100 times, boost points. And then everything you did for the last three months is like inflated away in like, in like a day, right? And you can't do anything about it.
00:39:57.258 - 00:40:43.844, Speaker B: It's just points. So it's just like hyper centralization essentially, of the future token airdrop. So this gives them the, I think it gives them the flexibility to screw over the Sibyl farmers, right, where they, you know, do a bunch of civil farming and then they don't, you know, the point system changes and it re changes. But, yeah, I don't think it's gonna stay around because I think that if people get burned enough times, like doing this farming, like, like pool two doesn't really, is not a thing anymore, right? Like, you don't play pool two games either. You don't play games, for instance, because people just like, okay, I remember what happened, you know, and I think, like, there's like, no, there's no olympus forks I can make. Cause I know what happened there. There could be new mechanisms where it's not as obvious, but points eventually will be like, okay, I'm overpaying for an activity that I wouldn't normally do.
00:40:43.844 - 00:41:18.074, Speaker B: I get that. I'm getting points. But, you know, there's also this thing where people put a bid in whale market and then like, look at this bid in whale market that, that like, justifies you farming this for, you know, six months, right? It's a little bit, it's a little bit disingenuous because you can't sell anything there. And it's like you can use the money that you make from people overpaying for the burgers. Like, it's like, let's come back to the restaurant, right? If people paying you $1,000 burger, you take this money and you buy the shares of your restaurant in the market, then these shares keep going up. People eat more and more burgers. At some point, no one's gonna like, once the scheme is over, once the scheme is over, no one's gonna eat any thousand dollar burgers at the restaurant anymore.
00:41:18.074 - 00:41:28.214, Speaker B: And then the restaurant price, the shares are also going to collapse because it's still just selling burgers. So it reminds me a lot about Defi pool two, actually. It's a very obfuscated defi pool two.
00:41:28.834 - 00:42:02.458, Speaker A: Yeah. I really like how optimism just do the retroactive grants any of you've been contributing, whether that be a protocol, whether that be, I don't know, doing whatever contributing, and then. But the part I don't like about that is, like, bankless. I've got like, 45 different subsidiaries across the the planet, and they're all getting shit op tokens, but it's bankless Dao, so that doesn't matter. But I quite like that because it's ongoing. They're not kind of like blowing the load initially. It's like it allows people to be sticking around and kind of checking out what's going on over there.
00:42:02.458 - 00:42:51.394, Speaker A: But yeah, it's like the tapioca guys are going to do, like an options airdrop. So people who've been, like, farming the protocol are participating in the LBP. You'll get an options airdrop, but you'll be purchasing the token at, say, like 50% of discount. So even though the broke. Yeah, so people are definitely farming the protocol, or in return just giving away free tokens and immediately boost shopping your treasury that way. So there's some interesting players on it that I'm taking up to market, but I'd love to see some data on customer retention from some of these points programs, because there's that many going on at once, I think it's going to be extremely low. So what's going on with Oxfund now? Formerly open exchange formally, I love the name GDX.
00:42:51.394 - 00:42:56.774, Speaker A: At the time, I thought it was fucking hilarious. So what you guys build now?
00:42:57.994 - 00:43:21.384, Speaker B: Yeah, oxide fun is kind of a cd five exchange. So it's metamask, sign in, and then you can trade. So it's all aux collateral right now, which means that the exchange token is the native token of the collateral, that's the p and L currency. So you still trade bitcoin, USD, perps, Eth, USD, perps. But the p and L is settled in Nox. It's a model that no one's really done since 2019. There are some products that tried it then.
00:43:21.384 - 00:43:48.970, Speaker B: I think it's a super interesting model because it's a bit like mixing Olympus and DydX. Dydx. The problem is a bit that in the initial liquidity of mining, you don't have to own any DyDX. You can just farm it and then sell it, because you're just trade mining. Whereas here we have these mission yields, where if you do trading missions on the exchange, you get paid a yield and aux, but you can only get it if you. It's proportional. It's a linear thing.
00:43:48.970 - 00:44:32.944, Speaker B: So essentially, to get your yield on aux, you must do the missions each day. And some of them are trade a certain size or have a certain oi open the kind of stuff. So I'm kind of like abstracting out the farming element to saying, what is the thing that we want people to do and try? And then as the mission yield goes lower, they might still do it every day, or they may still do it quite often. So that's one element. The second element is that later we can add multicollat, so you can trade with ether or tether or whatever, but the system is still margin in aux. So essentially, when people get liquidated, or they need to top up, their coins actually get converted into aux. There's only one way liquidation is up, because you can only get liquidated that way since the system is aux denominated.
00:44:32.944 - 00:45:07.344, Speaker B: You know, if you deposit, someone deposits ether, they lose money, that that will. Basically, they have to buy aux in the market to then pay the guy in the, you know, his p and L, essentially. So that. That also, no one's really tried. So, you know, because I thought a lot about, like, solvency and like, Luna USC FTT, and what I realized is that, see, all Sam had to do was have a clause in there that, like, in a extreme scenario, everyone's getting FTT. And if you made that clear to people, they might have still traded there, because they might have said, well, FTT is awesome. You give me some FTT, who cares? In extreme scenario, right, like that.
00:45:07.344 - 00:45:40.694, Speaker B: That may have been the case actually, in many, many clients cases, maybe others would have not been okay with that. But that's kind of like an honest approach to exchanges, right? Because whenever you have exchange token, use this portfolio margin that already becomes a risk. So I thought, why not you denominate the p and L of it in Knox? Because then there's no solvency risk. The protocol always has enough aux to pay out traders. It's just a matter of what happens when that occurs. And the second thing is that there's a natural effect where, let's say, the mobile coin thing in 2021 happened here. A big trader comes and makes a lot versus market makers.
00:45:40.694 - 00:46:14.068, Speaker B: They would simply get the aux from them, but they would not be a big holder. They actually now incentivize to support the protocol because they can't dump it either. If they dump a huge amount, it's going to go down. So there's a weird, it's like a white hat kind of a thing, where if you make a ton of box, you actually then be like, okay, now how do we build, like, a better mechanism? So I think it has a nice auto corrective structure to it, and then there's like a, you know, a bunch of other small innovations where, you know, I think there's new ways to do copy trading that are kind of cool. Kyle and I will do or run some copy trading ideas. We'll have a battle vault. So we'll battle each week, see.
00:46:14.068 - 00:46:43.182, Speaker B: See who makes more money. We'll talk about our position. So it's just like a social. And also, I think because it's like, all the vaults are nox, I think copy trading, hyper liquid vaults, they are launched, but there's not that many vaults. And part of the reason is that you're kind of incurring, like, a blood debt when you open a vault and then your followers go in there, and then you blow up. So you just, if you're a good trader, you're just like, why would I want to incur blood debt by doing this, right? Like, I'd rather just trade normally. So that's a problem in the copy trading space.
00:46:43.182 - 00:47:13.914, Speaker B: So you end up with this thing where most centralized exchanges, their copy trading vaults are actually the internal team trading with the other team. So it's just like, not even a. There's no one really running them. It's just like, here are some things you could do, right? Here are some strategies you could do. And so it tends to be that kols don't like to do copy trading because it's too. The stakes are too high, right? Like, their reputation is at risk. But I think that that's actually a huge market because I think if you look at people talking about views, like, sharing stuff, like, as long as the stakes are lower.
00:47:13.914 - 00:47:47.594, Speaker B: They're happy to do that. Cause then it's just like, you know, I bet on the sports team to win, like, oh, I lost money. Okay, then we all lost, like, some money together. Who cares, right? So if you think about 2018 BitMax, at that time, the meta was, you put 95% of your bitcoin in cold storage, you put 5% on BitMex, and you hedge with it, you trade with it, whatever. But there was no idea that you put all your money on a perp exchange. That that would be completely insane at that time. Over time, I think FTX created this meta where with portfolio margin for every coin, with yield on everything, with fiat on off ramp, it just said, put all your money on a perp exchange.
00:47:47.594 - 00:48:25.986, Speaker B: And I think that that actually is not healthy for the space because it teaches people that they should gamble with their entire stack, basically. So you have this phenomenon now where people are in the space for many years and they have no money because they keep losing all of it on purpose changes. So I think that, uh, I think we'll be able to do copy trading vaults a lot smoother because, one, it's aux denominated that the vault sizes and dollars will be smaller. We'll have schemes where people, you know, it, they're. They're still putting on positions, and they're chatting about them and they're talking about them, but it's all like, uh, smaller scale. We do cool things where if you make money, then, like, the house puts more money in your vault, right? So you can kind of be proud. You can be like, I'm an asset manager.
00:48:25.986 - 00:48:56.086, Speaker B: I'm managing some auxiliary. So I kind of want to just, like, play into all the social fi elements of that. Because social fi is cool. Because, you know, when someone shows you an NFT and then it loses money, it's a lot better than if you, like, invest with him, right? You feel like somehow it's a little bit more like, okay, well, I bought it for the art. Whereas if you invest in the, you know, in a guy's fund, then you're like, okay, well, then, you know, it's a. It's a very grave thing. So I feel like, um, copy trading vault is somewhere in the middle of that.
00:48:56.086 - 00:49:34.658, Speaker B: And I think also, I guess the third mechanism we have is this idea of a second token called milk, where you earn it by realizing losses on the exchange. And at first, just the meme coin in the future, there can be more value, but basically, it's like a proof of work coin generated by losing money on the exchange. A bit like a point system, I guess you could call it. But just like you're getting tokens, at least it's an ERC 20 token. People can value it however they want. But I think that that's cool because longer term, it'd be cool if the people who lost money on exchange, they get a long term ownership of the exchange. Let's say people who lost a lot on bybit, all that kind of stuff, at the end of it, they're like, wait a second, I actually own a permanent piece of something.
00:49:34.658 - 00:50:32.648, Speaker B: Maybe they can't even sell it because it's not liquid, so they can't sell the last thing in their house kind of thing, but they have a permanent ownership of something. I think that's cool. I think also there's this idea of the affiliate fee model in c, five exchanges that that's a little bit, a lot of leakage of value out, right? Like when the Instagram influencer shows you the reflink and then 69%, 80% goes out to that guy and he's not using the platform himself. That's just money that permanently leaks. I think with the token model that we want to do longer term, like we want to just have as little leakage as possible. We want to have as much value accruals the token itself as possible. That way it's like a proper, you know, it's a proper standalone vibe, I guess you could call it, because our community has been through a lot, obviously, you know, the coin, when the GTX thing went out and flex went from $0.03
00:50:32.648 - 00:50:57.926, Speaker B: eventually to $8 and then Aux equivalent 100 x to 100 to one and went from $0.08 back to half a cent, or what Kyle calls the prison resistance dump, or, you know, so. And since then, you know, it's been bouncing between half a cent to $0.02. But we haven't broken the prison resistance yet. So hopefully, hopefully, hopefully. Bitcoin all time high break aux prison resistance break. But you know, it's, we actually have a great community.
00:50:57.926 - 00:51:31.464, Speaker B: There's like 7000 holders on chain, you know, it's, you know, to compare, like, you know, Trump token has about a 10,000 on chain mog, you know, so it's in that league. And I was really just surprised by how much people wanted to buy the coin on chain but didn't want to deposit tether to the exchange. And then, so I thought ox fund is a cool solution to that problem because you're saying take your aux and get some yield on it, trade with it, and then over time we can decentralize custody as well. But I think that this is kind of a nice, because the product works. So the product is clean.
00:51:32.174 - 00:52:23.962, Speaker A: Yeah, I think people want to be nimble and I think people want like the ability to, like if a new shiny thing comes up then they don't have to go and be rooted on or off an off centralized exchange. And I also think it must be, must be so difficult for like any product at the minute just trying to compete with the noise that's actually going on in the industry. Like there's about 10 billion L2s launching, there's a million other l one's launching. And like all of these have got their own like exchanges and perhaps x's and all this kind of shit on. But so I think teams who are just kind of resting on the laurels and just like building it and they'll come think they're fucked. And like, I just, I don't think, I don't think they've got any stay in power whatsoever. So having these kind of syncs and customer acquisition channels and like light incentives that kind of make people want to stick around, I think.
00:52:23.962 - 00:52:30.504, Speaker A: I don't think people are looking too much into that and I think they're leaving so much on the table because someone will just go and leave and use another product.
00:52:31.164 - 00:52:56.824, Speaker B: Absolutely, absolutely. And a lot of people don't realize this too. But naturally the newcomer exchange has an advantage over the old one. If you have the same exact exchange, you clone it. The new one has an advantage because this token hasn't pumped yet. So you take an example of an old mature exchange, a second tier one. I won't name any because I don't want to accidentally fund any, but the coins already up 100 x 200 x 500 x from its early days price, that community has gotten rich.
00:52:56.824 - 00:53:26.180, Speaker B: Now it's kind of mostly a sideways ish, sometimes up, sometimes down. But you don't get to offer the appreciation of the coin to people anymore. You have to then lower incentives and eventually you're just like, okay, it's kind of just like a treasury token that they have. So that tends to happen every cycle. And that's why in a lot of markets people are like, okay, what is the next new exchange? Because we can trade anywhere we want, but I want to get paid. Like I want to be early and I want to get paid. So there's actually an Olympus effect to exchange.
00:53:26.180 - 00:54:08.126, Speaker B: People don't realize this because people are like, okay, let's all trade on some new exchange, and then we all get the points from it, we all get the tokens from it, we all get the whatever. And Token goes up and new people join the exchange because exchange trading is so fungible. That's why there's been this insane cycling of the second tier and even the first tier. But you have that insane cycling in the offshore market because it's just, there's many vectors of customer acquisition from token appreciation that you can't do once you're mature. And there's a very deep concept in crypto almost, which is like the main use case of crypto is to be early. One of the main use cases, a meme coin is great if you're early. It's not a very good use case.
00:54:08.126 - 00:54:21.236, Speaker B: If you buy it late, then you're like, okay, I joined the community. You buy bored apes at 150 ether. The use case for you is you don't feel like you're using much. You're like, okay, I'm using my bored ape every day. I'm embarrassed. Whereas if you buy it cheaper, you're like, okay, that's awesome. I'm flexing.
00:54:21.236 - 00:54:49.900, Speaker B: So, like that, that is a great example of how looking for spots where the market structurally prefers the underdog versus the new one. I think that that's a really, really interesting thing. I mean, that's why you see a lot of new purposes get funded now. I mean, I think arguably too many, but because they understand this, they understand that it doesn't actually take that much. Everything, the product is about the same. You get some mind share. People all farmer at the same time.
00:54:49.900 - 00:55:17.952, Speaker B: People all come and use it at the same time. There's a price pump. If you want to enjoy the price pump, you know, that is a, it's a tried and true story, right? Thinking about last cycle, like two cycles ago, fcoin, right? They have the liquidity mining and the whole story is like up and down within like a few months, really. But you know that, that at some point had like, I don't know, like 10,000 bitcoin in it. Like a lot of ether in it. Like it was just like a, and it was all the liquidity mining, right? And so that's a great example of how it comes from nowhere. And people are like, okay, let's play.
00:55:17.952 - 00:55:36.992, Speaker B: So because people will trade whether it's here or there. They don't, they're not that sensitive to the basis points of comms, but they are sensitive to am I early and am I getting something out of it? And is it a noticeably better economic experience. So that's what I think we're trying.
00:55:37.008 - 00:55:47.030, Speaker A: To make few more. So lastly, like, have you been since obviously having some time away and you slip back into reality? Is it strange how quickly you can.
00:55:47.102 - 00:56:04.774, Speaker B: It's actually sad. It's quite sad. Like, I think now I sleep maybe 5 hours a day. It's hard to get much more than that just because you wake up in the morning, like, I want to check this. I want to see that. So I said on some other podcast, you know, I slept from 930 to basically 530 inside. And it's really peaceful and there's no distractions.
00:56:04.774 - 00:56:26.152, Speaker B: And now here, it's like, you know, it's absolutely impossible to do that. Yeah, but I mean, it's exciting. I mean, I would say I still prefer outside for sure. I mean, like. But there are days like, you wonder, like, can I, like, like, could I actually sit here and read a book for a day? And I don't think I can. I think I would just not have the focus. So it's sad.
00:56:26.152 - 00:56:28.880, Speaker B: That's what we lost, you know, this is what we gave up.
00:56:28.912 - 00:56:35.182, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I really struggled switching off on absolutely anything. Like, it's.
00:56:35.238 - 00:56:48.594, Speaker B: I think in Bali is better, I think. Yeah, I think in Bali is one of the best places. I think people are really into mindfulness in Bali. And, like, people actually try to take some time and say, okay, do I have time to heal my brain? Like, heal how? I.
00:56:49.014 - 00:56:55.646, Speaker A: You know, this, like, there's like, silent retreats you can do here and, like.
00:56:55.750 - 00:56:56.334, Speaker B: Have you done that?
00:56:56.374 - 00:56:58.874, Speaker A: Just don't think. I just don't think I'm ready for that yet.
00:57:00.374 - 00:57:03.794, Speaker B: You be the guy who leaves the second day having paid for the package. Right.
00:57:05.724 - 00:57:26.452, Speaker A: Like, um, I'd love to do like a. I've been trying to set myself up, like a three day fast or something. I seen someone on the timeline did 21 days just to try and, like, just to try and, like, I never do 21 days. That's fucking mental. But, like, I think I could do three days or just something a little bit more difficult, you know, so I don't have to get. Yeah, I don't know. I want to try something like that.
00:57:26.452 - 00:57:46.620, Speaker A: But a silent retreat for like, eleven days sounds like absolute hell to me. I seen someone on the timeline posting there was a retreat in Ubud and she'd just been and reset her amount of sexual partners that she'd been with.
00:57:46.652 - 00:57:51.584, Speaker B: Oh, that's. I saw that meme. That's hilarious. I wonder if it works.
00:57:53.724 - 00:58:26.714, Speaker A: Man. There's more pedal anything up that of that part of the world. It's some funky, funky people living up those neck of the woods. So we normally end things by asking a couple of really stupid questions that don't necessarily have any correct answers. So there's no right answer here. So first one, would you rather fight a duck that is the size of a horse? Of 100 duck sized horses?
00:58:30.694 - 00:58:41.446, Speaker B: One duck size, of course. I feel. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yes. I mean, it just seems like it's more tactile. Like you can.
00:58:41.446 - 00:58:45.154, Speaker B: You can see what's going on. I feel like you just get swarmed otherwise.
00:58:47.494 - 00:59:08.614, Speaker A: So this next one had Brian Pellegrino sat there for ten minutes trying to figure out if there was more. Let me ask you the question first. You'll figure out what I'm saying. So are there more doors? Doors is stuff that you'd walk through that you have at the front of your house. Like, you have all of those or are there more wheels? So, like wheels of a car, of a bike on earth.
00:59:11.354 - 00:59:28.104, Speaker B: Each car has four wheels. People have few doors. Definitely more houses than cars. But lots of vehicles, man. It's gotta be doors. I feel it's gotta be doors.
00:59:32.644 - 00:59:38.864, Speaker A: I love asking these questions because you gotta speak to, like, really smart people and you see how, like, rocking the brands.
00:59:41.004 - 00:59:45.024, Speaker B: They're like McKinsey interview questions. It reminds me of like the Jane Street McKinsey.
00:59:47.944 - 01:00:02.804, Speaker A: So this one's a bit more. I'm not really too keen on this one, but I thought it was quite interesting. So you have a 1 minute conversation with yourself either five years in the past or five years into the future. Which one do you choose and what would you say?
01:00:10.944 - 01:00:16.714, Speaker B: I mean, you just go in the past, right? And then. And then, uh, you know what already happened. That's definitely the easiest.
01:00:17.814 - 01:00:18.734, Speaker A: I was thinking about this earlier.
01:00:18.774 - 01:00:21.874, Speaker B: What do you, what would you even say to yourself in the future?
01:00:22.734 - 01:00:38.434, Speaker A: Could you go? Could you go? I got really stuck in this loop early. So you could go, like, from a purely financial perspective, you could go back in the past and tell yourself to buy something. Or would it be more positive to go into the future and ask what to buy?
01:00:40.834 - 01:00:42.614, Speaker B: Ah, true. Good point.
01:00:43.314 - 01:00:48.362, Speaker A: So it's like, are we bullish over the next five years of what's gone over the past?
01:00:48.538 - 01:01:18.994, Speaker B: Depends on your capital base. It depends on your capital base. If you have, let's say, $0 going, the future they tell you to, you know, depends on where you are, I think. But I guess go, okay, so if you go in the future, then you can like, build something you could, like, you'd be like, okay, you should go into like this kind of a business. Or you can avoid some pitfall. I think that's interesting, assuming that the pitfalls in the future are bigger than the pitfalls in the past. I think that's like a.
01:01:18.994 - 01:01:22.154, Speaker B: I know.
01:01:26.934 - 01:01:42.550, Speaker A: So one coin, you could hold the next ten years. Other than bitcoin, ethereum, and one NFT collection, it doesn't even have to be for financial incentive. It just has to be like, where you'd feel happy with solve for next.
01:01:42.582 - 01:02:00.682, Speaker B: It is really. That's really tough. I think. I mean, I think besides bitcoin and ether, it's gotta be Solana, right? Like, I think it's got the mind share to last several years. I think it's not much to. Yeah, I think probably Solana. I think nft set.
01:02:00.682 - 01:02:24.114, Speaker B: I mean, definitely milady Romilio. I think I actually just did an interview today with Charlotte Vaughn, the founder. It was only his second interview ever, but before we went through the whole founding. We went through the whole founding story. It's gonna be good, I hope. But, you know, I don't think people are understanding that it's not. It'll never become the cringe in the way that most nfts become cringe.
01:02:24.114 - 01:02:50.106, Speaker B: Like, punks never became that cringe because it was never that showy. It was more like the ethos was better, whereas board apes became very cringe over time. And then it's now less cringe. But there's like a cringe based kind of. But because malays are like, they've done so much like self referential cancels already. Like, you know, with the Nazi. With the nazi, like the nazi anorexia cult stuff.
01:02:50.106 - 01:03:15.130, Speaker B: And the journalists don't get the joke at all. So like, wait a second. Why are people supporting nazi anorexia cults? Right? And so that's just such a cool thing because it just, it just means that like, no actor can ever come and make it cringe because they'll just be like, I can't join that. Like, it's too crazy. And so it'll always, I think in over ten years, I think that's like a very, very strong. Otherwise punks is the natural answer, I think. I mean, punks is the most Lindy set.
01:03:15.130 - 01:03:20.054, Speaker B: I think it's, it's very, very safe, actually. I think.
01:03:20.924 - 01:03:22.864, Speaker A: Have you got a, have you got any throne?
01:03:23.804 - 01:03:25.984, Speaker B: No, I don't have Donna ether on.
01:03:27.204 - 01:03:34.024, Speaker A: Yeah, it reminds me a bit. Do you remember? No, no, no. I think my wife had killed me.
01:03:36.124 - 01:03:43.824, Speaker B: But those are. Right. What's the for now, the rocks? Um, a few hundred.
01:03:45.744 - 01:03:47.084, Speaker A: Definitely above 100.
01:03:47.824 - 01:03:58.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look at auto glyphs. The floor is what now? Like 250. So probably somewhere below auto east rock.
01:03:58.152 - 01:04:14.098, Speaker A: Floor doesn't want to come up. No, no, it's not showing. Yeah, but the, um. I don't know. I. I do. I need to pick up some maladies.
01:04:14.098 - 01:04:22.114, Speaker A: I need to. I've just been buying some bitcoin, nft stuff because I think a lot of, like, someone swiped like, 30 node monkeys today or something.
01:04:22.234 - 01:04:38.154, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I also like the node monkeys a lot. I think that's going to be really, really strong. Bitcoin puppets. Interesting. Also, I think the bitcoin sets, though, it's just a little bit early in the whole creation, so you don't know how it ends. Like, it's a bit like cryptokitties, right? Like crypto kitties.
01:04:38.154 - 01:04:53.424, Speaker B: Like, I would have thought, you know, in 2017, we'll be Lindy because it's just like the first one to get big, but somehow it doesn't matter because of a lot of reasons. But, you know, so in terms of ten years, it's hard to say.
01:04:54.444 - 01:05:17.574, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think, just like a side question on that. Do you think when, like, NFT projects start promising utility and like, overselling utility, is that akin to like a DeFi protocol getting hamstrung by it being actually revenue generating? Because these people started. People started doing weird price analysis on shit that actually has revenue.
01:05:19.354 - 01:05:54.010, Speaker B: So I think there's a set of things that can aspire to be, let's say, high art or high culture. I think punks is solidly in the high culture ethos. I think that all the sotheby's auctions only further fortifies that. I think that, however, not everything can be high art. So that there's going to be stuff where it is utility based and that helps it grow, like, for a while, like Azuki and bored apes, it got a lot of value from that. But the problem you run into there is that the utility in the end, will never be as good as the community hopes it to be. Because at the end of the day, these are pictures, these are jpegs that we're collecting.
01:05:54.010 - 01:06:29.514, Speaker B: So, like, you know, you can have in. In real life events, you can have stuff, you can have new drops, but there comes a point when, again, it's a little bit too mature. And then the use case of being early is gone. You can't be early anymore. You got to be early. There's a set of people who are like, maybe I'll rebuy for the next wave. But I feel like I'm already late here because the early vibes of an NFT community are very special people, you know, that's why NSK community is like notorious flippers, right, compared to, let's say, coins.
01:06:29.514 - 01:06:49.494, Speaker B: Because they, they also get that, you know, this is like collecting sticker packs, right? It's like when you go to recess in middle school and you collect sticker packs or something. Like, it's just hard to say. I'm gonna hold a sticker for like five years. Cause you're like, this might not be worth anything in like two days. Like, you know, like you're trading your food. You know, it's just not a. There's not a solid.
01:06:49.494 - 01:07:21.174, Speaker B: I think, and I think that utility makes it worse by making the disappointment of the community more, more, more real. Right. I think the elemental's launch was a great example of that. That was really. I think yuga labs also hasn't really, I mean, it's hard to say because it's honestly like a single pump will change the whole narrative. So if they just wait their time in a bull market, a single pump, and then we're talking about how great these things are. Again, that's the beauty of nfts, right? At some price, like, wow, penguins look amazing.
01:07:21.174 - 01:07:58.384, Speaker B: I think we, I think we bought hundreds of penguins in the early days and like, at that time we were like, is this investible? Is this an asset class like penguins? And like, I believe most of them were sold in auction already. But, you know, now it's like 28th floor. Like, that's so, so history is always. It's very hard to know. At that time, I don't think anyone thought penguins could go to 20th floor, actually. I think that people would have said many other things, but that's kind of the, that's kind of the cool thing about nfts, actually, which is that people who are normally good at NFC's are not actually the ones who are good at trading coins. I feel it's a different skill set.
01:07:58.384 - 01:08:47.854, Speaker B: I think that NFT collecting is on bitcoin is going to be really, really interesting because it's a whole, is a, it's a stronger holder, natural holder based than ether. I mean, ether guys are flipping a lot more because it's a naturally, you know, you put your Ethan icos, you put it in defi, you put it here, you maximize yield there. Whereas bitcoin is like, okay, I buy it now what? Right, so last cycle there were the paypays, right? Like the rare paypays. And that for a while was all right. And I think like the paypi token when it launched, you know, that gets a lot of, you know, and I think rare paypes, they also had the. I think they had the Matt Fury debate as well. But I think that longer run bitcoin and NFTs culture on bitcoin has tremendous value because at the end of the day, bitcoin is just scarcity.
01:08:47.854 - 01:09:23.188, Speaker B: So what's cooler than collecting scarcity on scarcity? There's just more ways to show how early you are because one of the main use cases of bitcoin especially is being very early proving that you didn't sell anything. 2013 utxos. 2012 utxos. Right. So that's why I think a lot of those Utxos, if they haven't moved now, they probably won't move because it's probably going to be worth more in some other, like, you know, they can probably get some nfts in the future off that. That's already worth more than, like, you know, like, that's. That's the cool thing about culture, right? It becomes a proof of holding.
01:09:23.188 - 01:09:28.112, Speaker B: It's almost like its own, like, launch pool. It's like a very stealth launch pool if you have like a very early UtxO.
01:09:28.308 - 01:09:59.038, Speaker A: Yeah. Magic Eden's QR UX at the minute is really, really interesting for that because they'll show you if there's. If there is like a bitcoin NfT where the inscription and like that, that specific sat was from, I don't know, the big bitcoin pizza original 10,000 that got, like, transferred, you know, so it's like, it'll show you, like little pieces of history, like, inscribed into that. In that. So that SAP. And it makes you think twice about actually wanting to go and sell it, you know what I mean? But the UI ux, they've done a really, really good job of doing that.
01:09:59.216 - 01:10:00.774, Speaker B: I'll check it out and it's cool.
