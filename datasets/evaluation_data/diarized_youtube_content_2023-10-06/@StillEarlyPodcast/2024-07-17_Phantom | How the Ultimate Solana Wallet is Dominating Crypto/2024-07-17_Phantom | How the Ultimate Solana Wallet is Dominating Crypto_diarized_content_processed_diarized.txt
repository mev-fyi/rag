00:00:00.200 - 00:00:01.294, Speaker A: It was kind of business as usual.
00:00:01.342 - 00:00:06.670, Speaker B: And I was gonna, like, be selfish and personally ask you guys to build, like, the best Solana portfolio truck.
00:00:06.710 - 00:00:09.918, Speaker A: When we do something poorly, like everybody really lets you know.
00:00:09.974 - 00:00:13.190, Speaker B: And I refuse to call it X. I'll call it Twitter.
00:00:13.270 - 00:00:15.286, Speaker A: Quick one, nothing here is financial advice.
00:00:15.398 - 00:00:17.646, Speaker B: It's for entertainment and educational purposes only.
00:00:17.718 - 00:00:24.410, Speaker A: Always do your own research or speak to a financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Enjoy the episode and like. And subscribe.
00:00:30.800 - 00:00:42.220, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of still early. We've got Brian. I've been pressuring DM's to come on and tell us all about how you build wonderful products. Brian, how are you doing? So thanks. Sorry for getting you up so early.
00:00:42.880 - 00:00:51.860, Speaker A: No, I'm doing great. This is good for me. Bright and early. I think it's 630 in the morning here when we're recording this episode. But I'm excited to talk Phantom and everything with you.
00:00:52.320 - 00:01:02.580, Speaker B: 100%. 100%. I've got to say, the past twelve months for you guys, it looks like you're just getting win after win after win.
00:01:03.400 - 00:01:03.928, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:03.984 - 00:01:04.980, Speaker B: What's it been like?
00:01:05.680 - 00:01:36.082, Speaker A: Oh, it's been awesome. I think anyone in Solana who stuck it out through just the brutal year post FTX that Solana had, there's a lot that I'd say unfairly was levied at the community. Everyone kind of knew that there was a lot of potential and it's just been really fun to see all of that come to fruition. Just tons of, you know, user growth and activity. And it's just been a really, really fun time to be a part of. And then, you know, now we're trying to take that energy just out to every ecosystem we're part of.
00:01:36.266 - 00:01:47.106, Speaker B: Yeah, I haven't really heard of, heard much on, like, the early stages and, like, origins of it. Is there, is anything interesting there? Like, where did it all span from?
00:01:47.178 - 00:01:49.038, Speaker A: Was there anything for fandom itself?
00:01:49.194 - 00:01:52.118, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, what, what was. What was that whole story like?
00:01:52.254 - 00:02:28.104, Speaker A: Yeah, happy to dive into it. Essentially, the. The core founding team of Phantom got their start in kind of the, at least in crypto, in like, that 2017 era of crypto. I think a lot of people came in then and very defi focused builders. Their team originally built an exchange on ethereum called Zero X. If you've used Jupyter on Solana, it's very similar where it helps you route orders across other exchanges, like a uniswap or some other pools as well. And through that process, really saw that.
00:02:28.192 - 00:02:28.464, Speaker B: Wow.
00:02:28.512 - 00:03:10.032, Speaker A: Wallets have a lot of power for just not only making apps a great experience, but just that whole first step of a user coming into crypto, being safe, having a really great experience. At the time, no one was really challenging metamask on ethereum. They made a bet that, hey, let's try something very different, a very opinionated design first approach. But rather than try to compete with metamask on their home turf, let's also make a bet on a nascent ecosystem at the same time. Solana was just starting. This was probably 2020, I think phantom launched in 2021, which kind of coincided with that first rise. And then.
00:03:10.032 - 00:03:12.940, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just been. It's just been awesome ever since.
00:03:13.440 - 00:03:48.284, Speaker B: Yeah. Was there any. Because it got a little bit scary at one point for Solana, even, even for, like, an ultra ball like me and obviously, you guys all. What was like, what I suppose we've. We've seen the past twelve months, you guys have absolutely killed it, and. But what was. Cause people will be like, oh, yeah, they've obviously benefited hugely from Solana success, but what people won't realize is there was that huge kind of doldrums in the Solana ecosystem, and, you know, it looks a bit shaky at times.
00:03:48.412 - 00:04:28.994, Speaker A: It was funny. I remember, like, so Solana's always done a really good job of hosting these community and builder events. And I remember being at the New York hacker house, I believe, sometime mid 2023, and there were all these, like, really negative headlines about Solana externally. But if you went to the hacker house, everyone was just very calm and, like, excited to be there. And, like, it was kind of business as usual. And there was some reporter that asked a friend of mine, a developer, that was like, oh, like, do you have plans, you know, to leave Solana because of these headlines, these bad news? And he was just like, I don't care about that at all. Like, it was a very, like, straightforward answer where I was like, there's such a.
00:04:28.994 - 00:05:07.256, Speaker A: That was such a clear disconnect between kind of what the narrative was externally versus what everyone was just building through. And, yeah, it's just been. It's been really awesome to see everyone kind of get their time in the sun there. And, yeah, there's definitely, I think, kind of, I think we're acutely aware that we work pretty hard to give a good user experience, but at the same time, you need, like, a really great chain, you need a really great ecosystem to show off. Like, so much of what we do is about discovery and, like, finding things for users to do. And, you know, now we're launching blinks and all this. And there's like, so much we can get into, too, about like, what the rest of the ecosystem is doing.
00:05:07.256 - 00:05:14.980, Speaker A: But, you know, us doing all the stuff alone wouldn't be enough. I think we need a really great ecosystem to build with.
00:05:15.400 - 00:06:02.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, you guys kind of like the now Reddit says, like the front page of the Internet, like, yeah, like, I look at you guys, like, in a similar light with regards to Solana. It's like the entrance portal to Solana, but with you mentioned. A key point, though, when there are so many shiny things happening in the ecosystem. I'll get onto a couple of them. I really want to pick your brain on. How do you decide which features and product to kind of focus on? Because that must be, it's like champagne problems, right? There's so many opportunities in the market where you could, like, all right, let's go all in on this. Like, how do you actually decide this is the feature we need to really focus on? Because this is what, like, totally.
00:06:02.280 - 00:06:03.008, Speaker B: Next.
00:06:03.184 - 00:06:37.810, Speaker A: It's a, it's a really good question and I think it's really hard and we don't necessarily have a perfect answer for it. And I think this trips a lot of teams up in crypto, too. It has tripped us up in the past, too, to be perfectly clear, because like you said, there is so much to build. And a lot of times we see what might be an end state solution like this sounds like it'd be a really good thing to have in five years. Let's just build it now. But you actually have to go backwards. And so one thing I'll kind of say on that is like, when Phantom started, almost all wallets at the time were like, oh, mobile's clearly the future.
00:06:37.810 - 00:07:41.262, Speaker A: And it is like right now, too. Most of our users are on mobile, but we chose to build an extension first because the core power user audience of crypto at the time, especially in bear markets, are like these defi power users, NFT power users, and they want a chrome extension. They want to connect their ledger and safely and have all that. And it was kind of like, it was a move that if you just purely looked at the numbers, wouldn't have made sense. But I personally think going to extension first was the right move, and now you see other wallets doing a similar thing. The way that we continue to do it now is there's a lot of sort of frameworks we have, but one is this concept of jobs to be done, which is essentially saying, take a step back. You don't necessarily know better than your users, but look at your current users and what are the jobs that they're hiring your product for? Essentially for a wallet, one of them is I need to be able to get funds into my wallethood very quickly.
00:07:41.262 - 00:08:27.376, Speaker A: On ramping. Like, that's a whole bucket. Another one is like, that we see very often is like, I'm just casually, like, checking my wallet to, like, see my balances. Did anything go up? And it's kind of like that monitoring aspect. There's a whole nother one around. Like, hey, I already know a really good dapp that I want to interact with and I want to be able to, like, find it safely, sign a transaction safely, make sure I'm not getting phished, all that kind of stuff. And then, yeah, I think what gets interesting and where we're kind of starting to focus now more on is that middle one I talked about where it's like users idly checking their wallet and there's, I think, so much untapped potential there of how do we help them define, like, the nest and the next interesting thing to do on crypto, essentially.
00:08:27.376 - 00:08:46.690, Speaker A: Like, that's one that I'm personally really excited about. So, yeah, I think it's to a large extent, it's a, it's kind of humbling because I think a lot of times we, like, myself included, get really excited about, like, oh, the future is going to look like this and let's start building this. And, yeah, taking that step back, kind of applying a framework really helps.
00:08:47.110 - 00:09:05.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to be selfish and personally ask you guys to build, like, the best Solana portfolio tracker. Because if I'm not just kind of, like, scanning from my phantom wallet, I'm, like, really struggling with any third party app. So if you could do that for me, that'd be amazing.
00:09:05.582 - 00:09:18.450, Speaker A: Yeah, love that, too. We kind of just dipped our first toe in that direction. We added charts to the wallet recently, which is just. And I find myself playing with that all the time. It's really fun. Yeah, there's just so much to do. Right.
00:09:18.450 - 00:09:37.612, Speaker A: That's like a whole rabbit hole where, like, you can get really deep into it. There's all this, like, tax stuff side, too. That's already teams doing really good there. Yeah. That I do have a personal opinion that I think kind of wallets will converge with those portfolio trackers over time. So. Yeah, I definitely hear you on that.
00:09:37.796 - 00:10:13.506, Speaker B: Yeah, there was something on that, like, kind of carrying on from that discussion you've just had. There is. There was like, a really interesting, and I don't know who runs the socials, like, for you guys, but there's really a mysterious intern. Yeah, there's a really interesting kind of interaction that happened. And I. I'm kind of a bit of a nerd for this because obviously we try and make our social feed look all pretty, and I think there's a real art to that and it's really, really subtle art. But when you released this kind of like the search bar function, you're talking people through it with a thread.
00:10:13.506 - 00:10:49.520, Speaker B: The other day on Twitter, and I refuse to call it x, I'll call it Twitter, someone had replied saying, can we not just search with the contract address? And then initially it was you can in the token search, and then like 45 minutes later or some shit, it was like, it was a retweet saying, no, actually you can, like, you, like, globally, like, in the search. I've now be able to search with a contract address. But what goes on behind the scenes, I don't know if it's a remote team or in office theme, but, like, what's going on when you kind of see that immediate kind of user feedback?
00:10:50.100 - 00:11:36.400, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I think in this case it was purely the miscommunication from our site was probably that we had temporarily removed that feature for some reason. I'm almost certain in that case it was also a security one or not a security one. That's really but a flow where users would accidentally, whenever we expose something in the wallet, we find that what can go wrong will go wrong. And a lot of times people are like, oh, the contract address, I just send money to it. Right? And so we were like, oh, yeah, let's take that out and then let's apply some safeguards to make sure that users don't actually do that and then turn it back on. But, yeah, to your point about, like, how that kind of works behind the scenes and the communications, like, we are a remote team.
00:11:36.400 - 00:12:29.716, Speaker A: We have a pretty core contingency, kind of like San Francisco, where I am, New York. And then I would say, like, over a third of our team is now international, a lot in Europe. And so there are people kind of around the clock, not only, like, shipping product, but, you know, we're always kind of, like, now trying to line up, like, what's the next, you know, like, product release? And how are we going to talk about this publicly? And we do like to try to create, like, turn little releases into things that, you know, get our users really engaged. We make, like, these really awesome hype videos for little features that kind of really just try to get users to, like, actually, actually do it and use it. And you'll notice a lot of the videos are about the usability aspect. You don't have to ask a question of, well, how do I use it? Because in the video, it's showing you this, that, that. And I think that's a really great way for us to get users to try it out.
00:12:29.716 - 00:13:28.872, Speaker A: And then we can see, are they continuing to use it? Is users dropping off? Are they having problems somewhere? We'll try to talk to users directly, get them on calls like this and do interviews, walk them through it. And so, yeah, it's, but it is fun because, like, we'll ship stuff and then I'd say we do a lot on, on slack as a team. And then, like, when there is that kind of release, you know, the, the intern is pretty prolific and they'll, they will be sitting on, on slack and they'll just be like, firing somebody's piping in these, these questions being like, hey, I replied to this. Is this right? And we'll just have an engineer, like, right away be like, yeah, yes, yes, no. And sometimes that turns right into, like, another ticket where it's like, you know, an order up for the chef and they just take the ticket and just fix it and ship it out in the next release. And when you get that velocity going, I think that's when, you know, it's, it's really fun when, like, Twitter is basically, like, lining up your next release for you. That's, that's when it's a really fun time to be building a product like.
00:13:28.896 - 00:13:50.848, Speaker B: That 100% and that immediately, like, product feedback. Some kind of traditional SaaS or web two company would kill for that. I mean, like, the, on the ball, like, can we have this? Can we have, this is rubbish. Can we, you know, it's, yeah, it's incredible invested, like, community is in this industry, isn't it?
00:13:50.984 - 00:14:20.412, Speaker A: It definitely. It cuts both ways, too. I'd say, like, when we do something poorly, like, everybody really lets, you know. And that was a humbling thing, too, to learn, because it's like, the initial reaction for anybody is to be like, well, you guys don't know, you know, like, blah, blah, blah. We've always made a really big point to not to very much respect, like, the user's opinion and be like, okay, they're probably right here. Like, what can we learn from this and what can we change? And then. But, yeah, you're right.
00:14:20.412 - 00:14:32.270, Speaker A: When it, when it goes well, and everyone's really hyped. It just, it makes you really excited to, like, keep shipping. And I think, thankfully, we've had a lot of those moments the last couple of months, and so it's, I feel really lucky to be part of that.
00:14:32.810 - 00:15:22.040, Speaker B: So the, I think there's a couple of teams that do this really well, but I think you guys with your mascot is really, really good and your whole branding overall, I think the trader Joe guys have got a good thing going on with their mascot. How strong of the focus internally is on brand and appeal and kind of just setting this overarching kind of tone of how you kind of deliver stuff, is that completely thought out? Because some teams do it by mistake and sometimes teams try to play it off as, oh, this is just how we do it. But I know fine well there is so much care and thought that goes into having a good kind of brand asset kit and how we deliver content and, like, consistency.
00:15:24.380 - 00:16:05.326, Speaker A: It's a good question. It is very intentional. So one of the three founders that I mentioned that kind of came over from those early Ethereum days, his name is Chris. He leads everything related to product and design at Phantom, and he drew the original Phantom Ghost. If you were around in 2021, we had this ghost that was, that looked very Mario ghost like and was, you know, facing the other way and very simple and people loved it. And then, and he was the one who, like, actually suggested he's like, I think we need to rebrand and have this new evolution of a ghost and make the colors later. And, and everyone was like, what are you talking about? Like, this is, you know, already a really good brand, but it's been very intentional from day one.
00:16:05.326 - 00:16:56.914, Speaker A: He sets a lot of the tone around that, but I think a lot of the thinking there is, like, wallets are one of the few things in crypto that people trust or like, have, need to have a lot of trust around and trust completely. And Phantom publishes its own audits, does all this stuff. At the end of the day, you really want users to continually look back to your wallet and expect you to be the voice of reason in the room to not get overly emotional. There's a reason why fandom and employees as well, stay out of a lot of Twitter beefs. Kind of when, when, you know, bad stuff is said, we kind of just let it be said and try to ship. Like, it's, it's very intentional because we want to be building a product that people, like, can rely on over a very long period of time. You know, hopefully their whole life and, you know, really put a lot of trust into.
00:16:56.914 - 00:17:26.302, Speaker A: They're putting serious money in here. It's like our responsibility. And so the trust, the brand trust goes there. But then at the same time, you know, it's like crypto is fun. It's supposed to be like this, like, light hearted thing. And so much can be very overly financialized in a negative way or a scary way. And I think bringing this really lighthearted ghost that's kind of flying through the world and showing it to you and being this kind of safe aspect, that's kind of what we want to embody.
00:17:26.302 - 00:17:35.238, Speaker A: And so as much as the brand kind of leads that and then the product tries to follow what the brand sets. Yeah, that's definitely been an intention of ours.
00:17:35.414 - 00:17:52.750, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it works really well. And I even still this day, I always see there'll be, like some random account and they'll bring up. They'll bring up the old ghost and the new iconography and, yeah, people got really attached. Some people got really attached to that old.
00:17:52.790 - 00:18:11.102, Speaker A: There's still a holdout community that want it back. Yeah, we have some old swag that we might give away at some point, some retro swag. But we need a name. We need a name for the new ghost. The old ghost's name was Sarah. We don't have a name for the new ghost necessarily yet. So if you have one, let us know.
00:18:11.102 - 00:18:12.050, Speaker A: We're all ears.
00:18:13.790 - 00:18:31.980, Speaker B: So I messaged following the launch of Blinks. Obviously, you guys are day one on that, but people coming in cold, they might have seen stuff coming across the Thailand. Can you kind of give us a high level and just any immediate thoughts? And then I've got some kind of follow on questions from that.
00:18:32.140 - 00:18:55.830, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. So I'd say what you saw, if you saw it, was like the very first alpha launch. That kind of proves that blinks are a thing. And now we're in this really cool phase where developers are trying their hand at building all kinds of different blinks. Blinks is like a. Is a Solana wide community initiative. It's not just a fan of initiative.
00:18:55.830 - 00:19:45.308, Speaker A: And how it works is it takes an existing protocol that already existed on Solana. It was called Solana pay transaction requests. It changes slightly and it rebrands it a little bit. And the goal of it is that now, as a developer, you can create these transactions for your users that can just live anywhere on the Internet. What that really means, which what I think is really cool, is that you don't necessarily need to go build your whole dapp from scratch and like build a whole website and build the infrastructure around that and find users to get there. You can just distill potentially, like the core thing of your dapp. Let's say it's make a swap, make a lens, you know, open a, like a Dex position vote, you know, do all these verbs.
00:19:45.308 - 00:20:30.166, Speaker A: You can distill that into like a link essentially, and just drop that link. One day it'll be anywhere. Right now it's on Twitter. And Twitter is great because most of your users are sitting on Twitter. So you can distill that core verb of your app, drop it on the Twitter, and then major wallets like Phantom can recognize, oh, this link is a blink and I can display it in a way that a user can now make a transaction on it. So instead of just seeing the normal link on Twitter where it's some URL and sometimes it shows, it unfurls on Twitter and it has a big image and it'll be like, the user will click it and they'll open a new tab and go to a site. That'll still be the default behavior if there's no wallet installed for a user.
00:20:30.166 - 00:21:09.352, Speaker A: But if there is a wallet, they can say like, hey, rather than. What's really cool about chrome extensions is they can say like, oh, rather than just leave this as is. Chrome extensions have the ability to selectively modify parts of websites. So if a user has phantom, we can say like, hey, do you want us as fandom to unfurl these blinks for you? The user says, yes, please do. We can see a blink and then we can change it right on Twitter to be like, here's a button, here's like an input amount, here's what you're signing kind of thing. And then if a user hits that button, executes, phantom pops up, gets a transaction simulation, sees what they're really signing, sends it on their way. I said a lot there.
00:21:09.352 - 00:21:21.000, Speaker A: So happy to go into any of that. But I think it's really cool because what it essentially is doing is it's distilling that verb of adapt into just a link that's easily shareable and can be found anywhere.
00:21:22.700 - 00:21:58.686, Speaker B: So on the receiving end user, and let's say, I don't know, there's a prediction marker in it and there's a blink from, I don't know, prediction marker. And then you can directly vote directly. Bet either way on Twitter, that's really low lift from like end user perspective. You just opt in within the phantom, Phantom Wallet. If you're using Phantom and then that gets split and then you can. Away you go. What is happening on the developer side to kind of streamline this? Is there kind of.
00:21:58.686 - 00:22:02.166, Speaker B: I seen something called like blink phone or something like.
00:22:02.238 - 00:22:02.854, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:02.942 - 00:22:07.370, Speaker B: Was trying to create like a no code environment because I'm like technically inept.
00:22:08.030 - 00:22:09.958, Speaker A: But really good question. Yeah.
00:22:10.014 - 00:22:32.906, Speaker B: If blockmates wanted to do. I don't know. So we have like premium research, like let's say solanapay integration on the backend. Premium research call action at the bottom, like premium article or tweet or some shit like that. And then you could check out basically without leaving the timeline, like, what's happening with regards to the ease of access for development?
00:22:33.098 - 00:22:56.064, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. I think the prediction market example is like a really good one. So this is where I said, like, it's not just a fandom thing, it's an all Solana thing, which is great. You mentioned blink, fun. There's another team dialect. There's all these teams coming in to basically help you build these things. It's early right now we're in this stage where I would say it's the alpha beta stage where there is this big focus on developers.
00:22:56.064 - 00:23:32.370, Speaker A: And I think over time it'll get a lot easier. But how it basically works when you distill it down. I mentioned that you don't have to go build this website anymore if you're going to build that prediction market. In the past you would have had to make this separate site and maybe on Twitter you could have dropped the link to it and just hoped that a user went to it, connected their wallet, did all that. Now as a developer, you can just take essentially the API that you had that powered that site. There is an API endpoint somewhere that says vote when a user is actually on your site. It would hit your servers and change.
00:23:32.370 - 00:24:06.218, Speaker A: They voted yes or no. Now you're just taking that, changing it a little bit and you're dropping it basically directly on Twitter. And what's changing is a way for the wallets like Phantom to just get metadata and display what they need to display right there. So that's a long way of saying it cuts down. It really cuts down what you're doing as a developer a lot. Distilling it down to what is that one API URL that you want? What's the core thing? Voting and yes and no. And then you're also throwing it away for others to see.
00:24:06.218 - 00:24:42.050, Speaker A: Like this is what I want you to display right here. Right. So on this link. So let's say it's, who do you think is going to win the presidential election, Trump or Biden? And you could say, and I want, like, for this link, I can drop a link in there that lets users vote between the two. And I want to have like an image, like a giant hero image with like both candidates, like facing each other, like, you know, boxing match style. And, and then like, phantom as a wallet will see that link and they'll go, it'll go through all the steps of like, okay, what's the image it wants? And it lives here. And like, let's populate the image.
00:24:42.050 - 00:25:29.010, Speaker A: What's the two options they want? They want like a, you know, vote for this guy, vote for this guy. Put those in there. A big submit button, like, to that there. And it kind of like, lets Phantom or someone else, like do the heart, do the harder work of like stitching it together, showing to users all that. And you're just very focused on, this is the core thing. What I think is really cool of it is the distribution side, because that world lets you as a developer, you could just be a one person shop coming up with cool ideas and throwing these out there and then relying on the Twitter algorithm and these major wallets to get you distribution. Maybe you can ride a hype wave and if you can put this out fast enough, you get it in front of users with just a tweet.
00:25:29.010 - 00:26:07.640, Speaker A: Rather than like, I need to go stand up a whole website and build this. And that's what gets me really excited and like making crypto kind of more part of the everyday discussion. And like so much of us already on Twitter and there's this kind of like, this plugged in Internet mentality and it's just shortening that development life cycle. So it's a long way saying like today it's fairly, you probably should be a developer to be creating these. There are no code solutions coming. I think linked out funds, one dialect is another one that we've worked with in the past. I'm sure there'll be more and it should just get easier and easier to build these things closer to breakpoint later this year, in September.
00:26:08.540 - 00:26:46.120, Speaker B: I think it's really interesting for, because every payments provider is, or every ecommerce store or even something a little bit larger is always looking to kind of how do we reduce friction? Like Amazon one click checkout, totally. I think they patented that. And like, apple Pay, like, if I, if I go on Instagram now and I get obviously tracked or whatever I'm doing, it suggests me someone I want to buy and I can't pay with apple pay. I'm like, jesus Christ, this is way too much friction. Well, I have to put my email in. That's a lot of shit. I'm not going to do this.
00:26:46.120 - 00:27:09.714, Speaker B: Like, you just get inherently lazy when you. When you're used to kind of totally low friction. I'm just kind of imagining a world where it's just like. Because there's already, like, the infrastructure for, like, Shopify and, like, the way the rate that shopify going and solana pain, stuff like that. So, like one Chicago one click checkout, like, on a timeline. Maybe it's not Twitter. Might not be.
00:27:09.892 - 00:27:10.390, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:10.470 - 00:27:27.318, Speaker B: Kind of browsing e commerce platform of choice, but, like an Instagram or maybe even like a Facebook or something along those lines. But, like, aside from, like, the financial aspects and prediction markets and trade, like that, like, the wider world, this could have greater implications for, I think.
00:27:27.494 - 00:27:49.576, Speaker A: Yeah, and that's what I said too. That, like, right now it's this alpha version. It's on Twitter. It's a little bit like, you know, it's not like a first party integration where Twitter themselves are doing these. Like, you have to ask your wallet to do this for you. Like, Phantom won't even do it by default right now because it is so new. Like, if they ask Phantom to do it or turn on a setting, I think it'd be really cool to think about, like, okay, what's a world look like where these are.
00:27:49.576 - 00:28:29.070, Speaker A: These are just part of every app that you use and they're done safely. And that's this really native feel, right? Like in. Yeah, Instagram, like, you know, already tries to serve you so many ads. But what if it was just, what if it was just like a better, like, version of that for you and it was direct, directly there, and you're bypassing a lot of middlemen there with a Solana transaction, you could be just being buying directly from somebody and cutting a lot out there. I don't know necessarily what platform is going to be next. Technically, at the end of the day, these are just links. You do need something that can recognize this.
00:28:29.070 - 00:29:10.290, Speaker A: Blink and unfurl, which is why a chrome extension on Twitter is a really good way to try it out. There's other examples to go off of, though. Obviously, Telegram would be really great if we could find a way to get something in there or an ethereum. There's a project called Forecaster that, to their credit, did a lot of this first with their own app. But they did in a way that's slightly different. They have their own app that you install that's very Twitter like in different, you know, forecaster unique ways. And that because they're like the first party of that app, they can be opinionated in how they display them.
00:29:10.290 - 00:30:00.882, Speaker A: And so I think there's, I think a lot of people are basically just trying this concept from a lot of different angles. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually, you know, teams started to work together and converge on a similar solution over time. But I think too, it like, as Phantom and wallets, there's a lot that we can do even if we see this really start to take off in a big way. And users want to find what are the blanks that people are interacting with. I spoke before about the trust and safety side of Phantom, and I think there's a role where we can help users discover really great blinks in the Phantom app in a trusted way. That would be a really good sign for me that this is really taking off. Yeah, I think we're just basically scratching the tip of the iceberg right now in terms of where this could go.
00:30:00.882 - 00:30:13.670, Speaker A: Different platforms, the potential, and from what I've heard, the developer pickup has been stronger than expected. So I'm pretty hopeful that we'll get some really unique ideas coming out of this.
00:30:14.010 - 00:30:21.364, Speaker B: Yeah, the frames on, well, Farcaster.
00:30:21.532 - 00:30:22.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:22.292 - 00:30:56.308, Speaker B: I thought that was really, really, really impressive. The only issue is it's like, it is pretty siloed away. It's kind of like that next funnel down away from kind of crypto Twitter. And I think that whoever came up with the dialect copy for what they had on the landing page of like putting crypto, putting the crypto into crypto Twitter, which is like, great. You need that one liner. The dialect team did that really, really well. He kind of meeting the users where they are.
00:30:56.308 - 00:31:59.690, Speaker B: And I think that was really important. I think Twitter telegram discord next expansion phase. I think it starts to look really, really interesting from there. I wonder what it could look like for kind of because this is really imagine like a traditional web two ecommerce store where you have your whole user journey, your click funnels and you can kind of track and monitor your traffic's came from here and they've converted from this specific link. And I just wonder if there's anything tethered to potentially like crypto native advertising bringing like off chain movements on chain because you could track that to kind of like a UTM link. Um, and then obviously if it executes on chain, then you can say for definite that this piece of content has directly corresponded to a conversion on chain. So I'm obviously putting, like, media head on here.
00:31:59.690 - 00:32:00.770, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:02.790 - 00:32:03.542, Speaker A: No, we need.
00:32:03.606 - 00:32:07.850, Speaker B: So it's just like, there's. There's something there, but I haven't really figured it out just yet.
00:32:08.230 - 00:32:38.544, Speaker A: Yeah, we definitely need those opinions and, like, experiences right now in, like, shaping that. You know, it's. It's a. It's a really good question of, like, what's the right balance there between the off chain and the on chain? Some stuff that we've tried in the past. We did. We had this feature that we launched in the bear market called shortcuts, where if you have an NFT already in your wallet, you can, like, imbue it with additional actions. And now that I like when this came out, I'm like, wow, these two are really similar.
00:32:38.544 - 00:32:57.776, Speaker A: It would make. It would be really awesome if we combine them over time. But, like, we've seen lots of things where, like, these e commerce stores or some kind of store, like, wants to do some loyalty program. Maybe you have some NFT that commemorates that. That's, you know, there's. There's all these. There's a lot that's been tried there, but then it's like, you know, in the wallet, if you're looking at it, we, like, gave you a.
00:32:57.776 - 00:33:20.000, Speaker A: Basically a way to, like, be like, oh, you're a holder of this. Like, here's all these interesting things you can do directly on these sites. I think the more that we can kind of, like, get those interesting things to do in front of a user in the right context and the right opportunity, that helps a lot there, but it's early, so. Yeah, if you want to try something, I think now's the time.
00:33:22.780 - 00:33:53.626, Speaker B: What, what do you think the kind of near future is for wallets? And I know it's slightly different on Solana as opposed to what you're kind of seeing in EVM land. A lot of push towards kind of abstraction. Smart. Smart contract wallets over external, well, in combination with externally owned accounts, put that way. But where do you think we're heading in the short term with regards to that?
00:33:53.658 - 00:34:31.782, Speaker A: Totally, we touched on it a lot. But an overarching theme is this idea of discovery finding things to do in crypto. I think that's going to be a broad theme that Fantom has underscoring a lot of its releases in the year ahead and upcoming features. You mentioned the searching tokens and portfolio and prices. We talked about blinks, finding interesting things to do. From where we sit, a lot of people talk about the onboarding problem in crypto. I think the more interesting problem and the harder problem to solve and the more impactful problem is the retention problem.
00:34:31.782 - 00:35:30.506, Speaker A: Like the idea that you already have users, they already find ways to get crypto in their wallets. How do we keep them coming back and finding interesting things to do? We found that a very few percent of users, you know, early on in Phantom's launch were actually interacting with Dapps. Most people were just holding coins and sending it back to exchanges or to their friends or whatever, and they weren't interacting with dapps. But the, the few that were interacting with Dapps were the core users that stuck it out and were coming back every month regardless of price, action, finding new things to do on their own. And so, like, where we, where we sit, we really think that's we can play a role in helping find more. Like, you know, introduce the broader set of users to new things to do in crypto. Also help those power users find, like, the next useful thing, next great trade for them to make, the next app for them to interact with.
00:35:30.506 - 00:35:53.946, Speaker A: You know, you name it. That's. That's a big focus for us. I think there's two other things as well. One is on that onboarding piece. We announced our first acquisition earlier this year called Bitsky. It's a great team that has been around crypto for a very long time, building lots of unique wallet and custody solutions.
00:35:53.946 - 00:36:44.420, Speaker A: They have a really awesome experience and all that. What we're going to be launching is an embedded wallet. Essentially, if you're an application that is going out there and already getting users on your own, maybe a lot of first time users who aren't in the crypto, and they expect that one click sign in with Google email, socials experience, we can help you power that. And there's a lot of crypto apps that try that today, but you end up a lot of times with these siloed wallets that live on this app tied to your Google, that it's hard to manage them or they kind of. That retention problem also really becomes a really hard thing for those wallets. Right. Like, are you going to keep using that address and how do you use funds? I think we have a really.
00:36:44.580 - 00:36:47.748, Speaker B: It's pretty siloed away when. Yeah, that's the case.
00:36:47.844 - 00:36:50.748, Speaker A: It's like, so totally. Yeah.
00:36:50.884 - 00:36:54.164, Speaker B: Solving one problem and creating another, like, you know, totally.
00:36:54.212 - 00:37:36.230, Speaker A: Yeah. If you ever use, like, friend tech, that's, that's, that was a really good example of that. And, like, I think we have a really, we're excited to do that in a way that, like, hey, you can do that on that app your first time, but we'll also help you then really easily, like, be like, hey, you can also use this with Phantom and bring the two together and just make it more seamless. Right. And have a user eject back out into Phantom and use their app like normal, or go with the app directly. And there's a whole world there that I think there's so many open questions, so much to build there that I'm personally excited about. But I think once we have those two things, kind of like the really easy onboarding, you're not managing seed phrases if you don't want to.
00:37:36.230 - 00:38:21.560, Speaker A: You know, you can just use your existing, you know, identifiers if you want is really great. Then the discovery and rechment problem, I think those are, like, the two big things we're going to solve. And then, yeah, I think the last thing is Phantom is a multi chain wallet. And we're just, we're going to be making just like how we made a very concentrated early bet on the potential of Solana. We're going to be making that for other chains. We just announced Monad this year, which I'm really excited about. And so it's, I would say, like, rather than, like, do it like, an every chain under the sun approach, we're going to try to provide, like, really world class support for the ones that we think have the best shot of getting users interacting with crypto.
00:38:22.820 - 00:38:40.636, Speaker B: And I don't know if this is just my vision of where great wallets will head, but do you guys think about messaging and wallets? All that messaging or social aspects at all? And I don't know. I just want to pick your brain on that, definitely.
00:38:40.828 - 00:39:01.530, Speaker A: I don't want to say too much. Messaging is really hard. A lot of wallets have tried it in the past. I think we're acutely aware of, like, you know, we talked at the beginning, there's so much to build. What do you choose? We definitely don't want to clutter the experience. There's kind of, like, this elegance of less is more in some ways. Again, security and safety is a huge thing.
00:39:01.530 - 00:39:41.806, Speaker A: Phishing, like, if we're going to open up messaging, like, how would that work? And look, and there's a lot there. I would say it might not be messaging to start, but there will be social components for sure in Phantom. And I think that's all I'll say. There should be more to be said later this year on it, but it'll be done in a way that I think that's really fun. And, yeah, if you already are using Phantom now, it's a good incentive to get your phantom set up now because you'll have the best experience with that. If you install it now, use it now rather than wait. That's all I'll say on the social side.
00:39:41.988 - 00:39:52.910, Speaker B: All right, well, that's maybe later in the year, but just to kind of wrap up, is there anything in the immediate future that you're excited about or people should be aware of?
00:39:54.690 - 00:40:38.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say that, like, blinks is probably the thing I'm most excited about in the short to medium term. And that concept of, if you're a builder, let's. Let's deconstruct the idea of adapt and, like, give, like, the one developer shop the ability to reach tons of users. We saw, like, pump that fund take off this year. I think it was still a small team, potentially, and they just ran away with all the hype and all the user volume. And there's this tiny team that just had a unique idea executed really well. And I think that trend of small upstart teams just becoming huge successes very quickly is going to accelerate with crypto in particular.
00:40:38.650 - 00:40:48.350, Speaker A: Particular. And Blinks is probably one of the. Or something like, blinks is. Is. Is one of the best ways to make that happen. Right. So, um, I'm excited for that.
00:40:48.350 - 00:40:57.230, Speaker A: Um, I I think that's a lot of untapped potential. So if you are a dev listener to this, check it out and, uh, hit us up about good ideas that you have.
00:40:57.810 - 00:41:14.918, Speaker B: All right, well, hope everyone's enjoyed that. Brian, thanks so much for your time. And, um, yeah, hopefully, like, later in the year, if you're rolling stuff out, we can do it again, but, um, yeah, appreciate it. And there's anything else I might have missed off, please. The floor is yours. And if not, uh, yeah, thanks again.
00:41:15.054 - 00:41:20.870, Speaker A: Oh, this is great. Yeah, let's for sure do it again. I'm happy to. This is good for me to wake up early. So let's.
00:41:21.030 - 00:41:21.470, Speaker B: Let's.
00:41:21.510 - 00:41:31.318, Speaker A: Let's. Let's do it again. Get in good habits now. But, yeah, I really enjoyed the discussion. Thanks for having me on. And, uh, yeah, I guess the only thing I'll say is check out phantom on Twitter. Give it a follow.
00:41:31.318 - 00:41:32.650, Speaker A: Give the intern some love.
00:41:33.450 - 00:41:47.258, Speaker B: There you go, everyone. We'll see you next week. And, oh, yeah, don't forget to subscribe. Editor keeps shouting at me. It's either that or my mic keeps breaking. They're gonna end up having a mutiny on my hands, and I'm gonna get sacked. Mike was good.
00:41:47.314 - 00:41:47.810, Speaker A: You're safe.
00:41:47.850 - 00:41:50.074, Speaker B: Yeah, Mike was great. I see everyone.
00:41:50.162 - 00:41:50.522, Speaker A: Bye.
00:41:50.586 - 00:41:56.210, Speaker B: All right, thanks for listening. If you enjoyed the show, please give us a like, subscribe and turn the notification bell on for next time. See ya.
