00:00:00.240 - 00:00:36.365, Speaker A: The way to think about kerosene is it can get you extremely. It could basically get you to a one to one loan to value or collateralization ratio. So 100% collateralization ratio. But you can keep putting in more and more kerosene so that the collateralization that the protocol sees for that 150% liquidation threshold could be much, much higher. So you could have a position where you've minted 100,000 dyad, you have 100,000 exactly of exogenous collateral, but you have a ton of kerosene. And so you could have an effectively 300% collateralization ratio. So you're basically one to one.
00:00:36.365 - 00:00:41.145, Speaker A: Very efficient position is pretty far from that liquidation threshold.
