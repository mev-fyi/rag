00:00:00.240 - 00:00:59.037, Speaker A: From nethermind and I'm here with Denisa from Nethermind as well, and Tessa from flashbots, who we are very grateful made some time to jam with us on MEV and today we're going to be talking about L2MEV and just kind of exploring and discussing some of the nuances of what's happening in the space, what Unichain is generating, what some of the challenges, et cetera. And to start off, how about we do a quick round of intros and I'm happy to start off just to set it. I'm John Church, also Iced. Cool. Some people know me as that in the Dao space. I got my start at Bankless Dao and actually excited to talk with Tessa because I first met her at the. At the group.
00:00:59.037 - 00:01:31.195, Speaker A: You don't talk about Fight Club and banquet style. And there was a. There's a fun meme for a long time. So, yeah, I think what I'm currently working on is focused on product at nethermind, both in the MEV space, in the ZK space, and also I sometimes teach or I weekly teach a class at Duke University. So that's me and Tessa. Would you like to be next?
00:01:32.495 - 00:01:50.219, Speaker B: Sure. So, yeah. I'm the head of market research at flashbots. My background is tradfi. I used to run a market neutral crypto fund and then I went into angel investing and started Fight Club, which was Bankless Dao's investment dao. Now we're kind of on our own because. Is there even a Bankless Dao who.
00:01:50.219 - 00:02:05.015, Speaker B: Who knows? But we just have some deal flow and it's. We have a newsletter that we send out with weekly deals and a monthly deep dive into early stage investing topics that we're seeing trends in. That's me.
00:02:05.755 - 00:02:09.291, Speaker A: Cool. And then Denisa.
00:02:09.443 - 00:02:44.477, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'm at core, I think I'm a fuzzy logician. But now I. So I joined nethermind at the beginning of the year and I'm super excited to be part of this wonderful team at nethermind. I work as a consensus researcher and the project I've been involved in are decentralized rollups. So I guess that's why Johnny invited me here. But I also teach at the University of Bucharest, but I teach formal verification and functional programming.
00:02:44.477 - 00:02:56.195, Speaker C: So yeah, that's. I really enjoyed that part as well. So. Yeah. And now I am very lucky to be in the mountains near Brand Castle celebrating Halloween with my family. So that's nice.
00:02:56.775 - 00:04:02.195, Speaker A: Yeah, very nice. Okay. So I think to kick things off, I wanted to Just do a real quick, like, what is mev? And I think that there's the, the default definition answer, which is maximal extractable value or strategies that block producers use, strategies that different actors use in the space. And I actually think that it's a definition that is very broad and disagreed with. But we all kind of know what we're talking about, and I think that it's actors using privileged information in different places in the network. And so this can be with swaps, supporting protocols, with liquidations, arbitrage, supporting price equilibrium with profit opportunities. And all of these different activities create, you know, costs on different places of the network.
00:04:02.195 - 00:04:40.965, Speaker A: And it's, it's a conversation that is very important in the, in the, you know, there's a, there's a special place for it on the Ethereum roadmap to try to align it to applications and then ultimately back to users. Because largely MEV is seen as a, as some, a net negative. And I say some because I think that there's positive MEV like arbitrage and liquidations, although I know that liquidity providers take the brunt of some of the arbitrage things. And there's a larger conversation there. Is there anything you'd add to that, Tessa or Denisa?
00:04:42.065 - 00:04:53.205, Speaker C: Well, you've taught me about this asymmetry of information, and this is what generates mev. Right. And. Yeah, but I'm sure Tessa has way more to say about this than me, so.
00:04:54.585 - 00:05:36.045, Speaker B: Well, I think an easy way to think about it is probably, at least on the Ethereum side of reordering transactions within a block. That's really where you extract some of the value. And it's kind of similar to tradfi terms. Right. You have front running, you have back running. Back running is traditionally what market makers do to get the price arbitrage from just the noise of trades. And then you have, I think, liquidations, which is like oev Oracle extractable value, which is as soon as there's a price update, say from your chainlink Oracle, you're trying to be either the next transaction to start your liquid liquidation or to do something else.
00:05:36.045 - 00:06:07.613, Speaker B: Same thing with NFTs. You know, once the NFT goes live, you want to be first in so that you can maximize, you know, you can get your, you can mint and get your hands on those NFTs. And those are similar concepts to what you have in hft. Right. You know, as soon as the market opens, sometimes you want to be first if there's like, been a big price move overnight, if there's a Closing auction. Sometimes you want to be the last one in on the closing auction because you know it's going to print different or you want to head at the last minute. So there's.
00:06:07.613 - 00:06:14.865, Speaker B: It's kind of very similar concepts to HFT and tradfi, just different terminology.
00:06:15.885 - 00:06:34.019, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super cool. It's. It's cool to bring the. Just your experience in tradfi into this. And the Oracle extractable value is an awesome point. That's a. That's one that I need to learn more about.
00:06:34.019 - 00:06:36.175, Speaker A: But I hear that's like the liquidations.
00:06:38.075 - 00:06:43.935, Speaker B: Yeah. It's actually quite a small piece of mev. Like if you looked at the entire picture of mev.
00:06:44.435 - 00:06:48.455, Speaker A: Interesting. And so what's the larger portion of mev?
00:06:50.115 - 00:07:19.775, Speaker B: The larger portion is sextext arbitrage, which some people may or may not consider mev, but they do want to get their orders into the top of the block. So there is some MEV on that portion of it. And then I think maybe if the market was more volatile, you would probably see more just atomic arbitrage happening within the same block. And that's where you get like your sandwich attacks or your back running if there's a lot of swap volume happening.
00:07:22.155 - 00:07:38.145, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. And because I think at least like. Because I know that the sex decks that supports the price parity between centralized exchanges and primarily the heavy competition happens in there because of. With mempool design. Right.
00:07:39.485 - 00:08:12.265, Speaker B: I think it just happens mainly because there's more liquidity in CEFI. So DeFi tends to be a lagger. So whenever you have a market that is the lead, which is. And there's a lot of CEFI markets too. Right. So there's a lot of momentum and arbitrage happening just in CEFI alone, but on very big moves, especially in very liquid tokens, like with USD or like usdt or like ETH usdt, you're. You're going to see like bigger price differentials within defi space.
00:08:12.265 - 00:08:14.053, Speaker B: And that's when you see a lot.
00:08:14.069 - 00:08:21.105, Speaker A: Of the arbitrage opportunities because of the block timing. Like the centralized exchanges are so fast, right?
00:08:21.465 - 00:08:24.329, Speaker B: Yeah. They're continuous. Yep.
00:08:24.497 - 00:08:53.165, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I think that starts. That brings us a little bit into our topic, which is L2Mev. So L1Mev is we have a mempool space and kind of. And it's a visible mempool space as long as multiple like and sometimes encrypted or private mempools. And that creates like people the ability to create private transactions.
00:08:53.165 - 00:09:04.925, Speaker A: I'D love to hear your thoughts on the current state of L2MEV, Tessa, because I think that you being at Flashbox, you're closest to the front line on all of this.
00:09:05.945 - 00:09:42.709, Speaker B: Yeah, L2MEV is still a little bit opaque. We're trying to shed more light on it. In fact, we have a couple of FRPs out for I think more L2MEV research, but it's still kind of a greenfield and nobody's really giving up their alpha in terms of searchers. So there are, you know, we have some academic research and I think Xerox podcast had a pretty good podcast maybe about a month ago about base mev. But the hard numbers, it's. It's very difficult to come by. So we're having a hard time actually quantifying it.
00:09:42.709 - 00:09:53.025, Speaker B: There's always estimates, there's dune dashboards with estimates, but nobody has like I would say a very concise estimate of what MEV is on L2.
00:09:53.885 - 00:09:54.533, Speaker A: Is there a.
00:09:54.589 - 00:09:55.545, Speaker C: For the moment?
00:09:56.205 - 00:09:59.745, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, for the moment, for the moment.
00:10:00.565 - 00:10:11.365, Speaker A: Well, is there a specific reason for that? Like, is it just like, because of the private sequencing or. I know that there's a lot more transactions that happen on L2s.
00:10:11.905 - 00:10:48.473, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a lot of different reasons. I think one of the major reasons is it's actually quite difficult to get the data. If you think of the number of transactions that happens because they have much shorter, I think 2 second for optimism, much lower than that for Arbitrum, the number of transactions that occur is just too much. So getting the actual data is quite difficult. And then a public repository of that data, because hosting all that is going to cost money. So that's One of the FRPs we have is trying to get a node operator and then find a pretty. Hopefully Google Cloud will do this for us.
00:10:48.473 - 00:10:53.281, Speaker B: A public repository for the status so everybody can use it going forward.
00:10:53.353 - 00:11:09.885, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I saw a statistic saying that. I think the peak was in August this summer in which 80% of the transaction on L1 were actually done on roll ups. Right. So that's a, that's a bigger piece of.
00:11:11.545 - 00:11:25.153, Speaker A: Yeah. And then hosting this data, I think it's, it's who. It always comes down to who's paying the cost. Like, and then who gets. Who. Who's paying the cost and then who gets to.
00:11:25.209 - 00:11:28.045, Speaker C: Who gets what, forgets what.
00:11:28.945 - 00:11:57.791, Speaker A: Which is in some ways, I think part of our talk here is that it always comes down to who's. Who's paying the cost for. For transactions, who gets to Be first, who wants to be last, et cetera. But okay, so we got. So L2s are looking opaque because we're missing data. I know that. So we're seeing a trend toward L2 like innovation in terms of sequencing.
00:11:57.791 - 00:12:33.725, Speaker A: And I'd love both your thoughts on this one because I know like Unichain is a big, like they're moving toward a decentralized sequencer because I think we'll right now centralized sequencing is probably because who's going to pay the cost? And so there's like the centralized sequencers are like, I don't know, we've got the data, it's not that important. But as decentralizes, the data will probably become like multiple operators will start paying attention to hosting the data. Is this, Am I, is my thinking right on this, Tessa, do you think or am I. Yeah, I think so.
00:12:34.665 - 00:12:39.405, Speaker B: Right. If the more operators you have that run.
00:12:46.345 - 00:12:47.085, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:47.865 - 00:12:52.325, Speaker B: Then. Then yeah, you should be able to record it and it should be able to be public.
00:12:52.705 - 00:12:53.445, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:55.265 - 00:12:56.525, Speaker C: Okay. So just.
00:12:56.945 - 00:12:58.953, Speaker A: Yep. Up to you. Sorry.
00:12:59.089 - 00:13:18.281, Speaker C: No, no, I'm just waiting. Okay. Let's speak about base roll ups. Let's speak about, let's speak about decentralizing roll ups and was. Because you were saying let's look at the future. So let's focus on that. John, I think you're muted.
00:13:18.393 - 00:13:19.559, Speaker B: Yeah. You're on mute.
00:13:19.697 - 00:13:38.375, Speaker A: I am muted. Thank you. I had a note. Yeah. So I think, Denisa, I know you're working on decentralizing some of Starknet. I'd love to hear some of your thoughts. And then we can kind of circle to what Flashbots is doing with Unichain because I think both of these are really, really novel.
00:13:38.795 - 00:14:13.183, Speaker C: Well, I think we can. So when you want to decentralize roll ups, you have three options at the moment. You either use the simplest one, which is escape hedges, which unfortunately, if you look on L2 bids, not all roll ups have a green wheel. Right. But that's basically giving some transaction power back to the L1 in case people want to take their funds out of the roll ups. Like, I don't know, they don't agree with some update that the rollup is doing and so on. So that's the simplest one.
00:14:13.183 - 00:15:17.475, Speaker C: Then there is the base roll up approach that Tessa was mentioning and MEV here. Yeah, I think it would be nice to explore and I think. Yeah, I've heard people mentioning that it may be MEV on base roll ups may be a bit more toxic. But yeah, let's digest this information. And then there is the Third approach that starknet is doing, which is I think we use the term but I don't know if there is a term yet for this. But we said like home rule sequencing in which you try to create your own network of stakers that will do like you divide the sequencer among a network of stakers that will be the proposers and Starkness for example, and Linnea I think is going to go the same. They announced that they're going to go the same, the same road because they don't care necessarily to have big network of validators and stakers.
00:15:17.475 - 00:15:48.705, Speaker C: They are engaging in classical BFD consensus protocols. Like StarkNet is using a version of Tendermint, the one is used on Cosmos. Blina is going to use QBFD I think again. But these are wonderful byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocols but they have the limitation that they don't scale to more than 200 nodes. Right. Because after that the communication it's a mess. Right.
00:15:48.705 - 00:16:01.249, Speaker C: So I think all approaches have pros and cons and yeah, it's. Yeah. I think this opens a lot of questions and discussion.
00:16:01.417 - 00:16:15.801, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think so to zoom in just a second on that is the it 200 is it validators and that can be in rotation. Right. Or like what's just. Could you share a little bit more about that?
00:16:15.993 - 00:16:31.356, Speaker C: Yeah, it depends on the strategy. Right. Because you can have a big network of stakers and from those you can use a committee that they will be your. Your two. Let's say, let's, let's. Let's say 200. Right.
00:16:31.356 - 00:17:06.575, Speaker C: Can be 100 or it can be more. It cannot be more than 200. Right. And you can choose a committee out of those stakers which will be your 200 and then it, it. It's a matter of how do you choose? Do you choose it randomly how you build a committee or you go Cosmos way in which you, you take the top 200 and that's okay. Then the impact is do we, do they all have the same stake or not? Do they have a limit on the stake but do they also have an upper cap on the stake? How does impact like if you.
00:17:11.115 - 00:17:13.491, Speaker B: Oh no. Denise is frozen for me.
00:17:13.643 - 00:17:15.015, Speaker A: Oh no, me too.
00:17:17.115 - 00:17:17.595, Speaker C: Can you.
00:17:17.635 - 00:17:21.379, Speaker A: All right, we're gonna. This is, this is the part of doing online.
00:17:21.427 - 00:17:37.902, Speaker C: Okay, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Mountains like what can the way. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I was saying that it's a matter of all the stakers will care about the healthy of the chain Right.
00:17:37.902 - 00:17:47.374, Speaker C: Of the roll up. Right. Is their stake at play. So they don't want to. They want to have a healthy chain. Right. Everyone is going for the healthy chain.
00:17:47.374 - 00:18:41.507, Speaker C: But then in theory, if you don't put an upper limit, there is a potential that one entity can have a trillion zillion of stake and then the other flow less. And the more stake you have, the more chances you're going to have to be a proposer. So you will have. Let's go back to mev. You will have the entire sequencing power. For example, I haven't seen for StarkNet was their sequencing strategy like first in, first out? How do you do this? Are there any specifications on the stakers like how they will on the proposal of the blog? Do they have to follow some rules or not? Right. And that gives a bit of a power and I think decentralizing the sequencer in order to avoid this OPAC MEV that Tessa was mentioning, I think it's a very good approach.
00:18:41.507 - 00:19:11.715, Speaker C: But let's not make and all of this we're going to be learning curves, but let's make sure that in a way we don't end up in one year and realize yeah, but we decentralize a component and we ended up with another centralized component because one staker can take it all or something like this. I think these are. I'm a very optimistic person but sometimes, yeah, some scenarios are a bit more dark than the others. But yeah.
00:19:14.305 - 00:19:15.725, Speaker A: Tessa, any comments.
00:19:17.545 - 00:19:21.689, Speaker B: On starknet? I don't really have any viewpoints on.
00:19:21.737 - 00:19:49.661, Speaker A: Starknet because at least for me, so that I think the thing that I want to highlight that I hear out of that is so there's the monopolistic power of proposing and that comes back to the point that you were kind of talking about of, of being able to order transactions. And so if you're able to propose with monopolistic power, you're able to order transactions any certain way. And is this right, Denisa?
00:19:49.853 - 00:20:32.783, Speaker C: Yes, but don't get me wrong, I am in love with the starknet protocol. So they found a very nice way of coupling block production and proving at the same time, at the same time of the underlying consensus protocol. Right. So they have a very beautiful protocol in which blogs a part of the transactions that you normally have on a blog. They will carry some ZK proofs and in order to optimize and have amazing performances, they are going to prove not the execution of the transactions that they are included in the block, but the execution of some past block that was already included. So I'M inviting everyone to look at their protocol. It's very beautiful.
00:20:32.783 - 00:21:11.089, Speaker C: Right. And ideally, you want to make it as healthy as you can from the tech side. Right. Like just avoid the social consensus on L2s is another different problem. Right. And yeah, as long as you can design by scratch a protocol that is healthy by nature and can recover on its own without making sure that you have social consensus, I think it's a nice world to be in. And I think roll ups will have this problem because they will not.
00:21:11.089 - 00:21:21.845, Speaker C: You can, you can use L1 consensus, but that will be a very big fuss. Right. L1 Social consensus for all decentralized roll ups.
00:21:23.305 - 00:21:28.865, Speaker A: Yeah. And that would be the, like the based. Based roll ups. Right?
00:21:30.365 - 00:21:38.629, Speaker C: Yeah. They will not have this problem. Right. But for. For base roll ups, that will not be a. A problem per se. Right.
00:21:38.629 - 00:22:09.175, Speaker C: Because base roll up, basically they are gonna use the all the L1 building block mechanism. Right. And okay, MEV is a. It's a MEV will be there. Right. But then if you go based, you have already all the mitigating mechanism that people work so much. And I'm sure Tessa can say a lot more on this one, but you will have all the mitigating power that.
00:22:09.175 - 00:22:23.809, Speaker C: To mitigate MEV and just focus on good mev. But then again, there is the question like, who gets the mev? Because it's not. Is it going back to the roll up or not? How is the economic there?
00:22:23.977 - 00:22:57.955, Speaker A: Yeah. And so I'm seeing there's some open questions here, you know, in terms of how does who gets to propose, who gets to do these different things? And I think so Unichain has a really novel approach to this, I think, and I'd love to hear more about that from you, Tessa, especially its relationship. It's flashbot blocks, Flashbots. So love to hear about that because I know that they're using their staking the uni token. There's a whole interesting spectrum happening there.
00:22:58.295 - 00:23:42.227, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think they did a very good job in their white paper outlining everything. But Unichain is based on optimism. So it should be a two second block time. But what we're doing with flash blocks is that we're kind of breaking it into four separate blocks within that two second time and giving essentially what are preconfs. You're going to have 200 to 250 millisecond blocks that are preconf and state is going to pass through from one block to the next so that it's going to be a little bit faster and Then ultimately they'll have the unit validators. I'm not sure how much detail was given within the validator set, whether or not what consensus they're using, but it's limited.
00:23:42.227 - 00:23:49.803, Speaker B: I think it's under 200 to start. So it might be Tendermint, I'm not sure, don't quote me on that, but.
00:23:49.819 - 00:23:54.215, Speaker C: This idea, I got it right, that Unichain is going to use tes, right?
00:23:55.475 - 00:24:05.935, Speaker B: That comes through the flash blocks process. So when we build those flash blocks that's going to be done duties.
00:24:07.635 - 00:24:32.375, Speaker C: Because I think using consensus like Tendermint, as you mentioned, so probably you use any kind of BFT consensus protocol that makes sense to have a consensus. I think having a network of at most 200 TEs, right, to run consensus among TEs using BFT protocols, that makes sense.
00:24:33.355 - 00:24:55.895, Speaker B: I'm not sure if the validator nodes are being run within tes. I see block builder itself because we did a little bit of a decentralized sequencer portion of it, like sequencer builder separation, that little block builder portion of it that's being run in tee, whether the validators are not.
00:24:58.885 - 00:25:05.705, Speaker A: And real quick, just so I know, tees, what is a tee?
00:25:06.885 - 00:25:54.929, Speaker B: TE is a hardware. It stands for Trusted Execution Environment. So you have it on your phones, like if you have an Android or if you have an iPhone, there's a little portion of your hardware chip and Apple calls it a secure enclave, I think Android calls it Titan. And within that programs can run, but nothing else can actually see into that program. So it's running kind of privately within that little hardware portion of it. So when you think about what applications work currently, it's usually your biometrics, like when you want to sign into your phone, that's kind of stored as a passkey within that secure enclave. So if you kind of lose it, you know, they have to reset everything, you have to make a new passkey, you know, that kind of process.
00:25:54.929 - 00:26:09.085, Speaker B: But it's the same same setup that Base Wallet is using for their wallet as well, where now you don't really need to rely on your see phrase or a password, you can just use your passkeys.
00:26:10.025 - 00:26:15.845, Speaker C: Does it make sense to phrase it like no one can tamper with the computation that happens?
00:26:18.155 - 00:26:38.295, Speaker B: Yes, in theory. I think in the SGX version of a te, Intel SGX that hasn't been proven. I mean they've broken it, but that's the assumption. And the other portion is that you can remotely attest that the computation happened within the TE and it happened the way it was supposed to happen.
00:26:40.435 - 00:26:47.415, Speaker A: And so how is this helping out with Unichain and how is this being implemented with Flash blocks?
00:26:48.115 - 00:27:09.815, Speaker B: So the implementation comes in the block builder process. We're doing this on L1 as well. So the block builder runs within a TE. So that way, you know, nobody can reorder it. You're the TE is just doing it automatically with. Due to the programming that you have in there and you can attest that it actually ran as expected.
00:27:12.795 - 00:27:29.995, Speaker A: Got it. So what I get is it's. So it's a private enclave where. Because I know that. I know that you know, bundles like people. There's a. There's a lot of like trust around bundle submission to like Beaver or Titan.
00:27:29.995 - 00:27:36.555, Speaker A: We're just like trusting that they don't abuse the bundles being sent. And it's like TE's kind of help out with this. Right?
00:27:36.855 - 00:27:37.635, Speaker B: Correct.
00:27:38.535 - 00:27:56.715, Speaker A: And so and I think because in flash blocks are using it to do their block building. So are they played into any other way than just making sure that it's like all submissions are private and safe?
00:27:58.975 - 00:28:02.075, Speaker B: I'm not. What do you mean by all submissions?
00:28:02.435 - 00:28:12.055, Speaker A: Oh, I'm assuming bundles are going in there so that. So that proposers can build in a private environment. Is that understanding wrong?
00:28:12.595 - 00:28:54.821, Speaker B: So we'll take the proposer term out of this because I think if you're talking pbs, there's a singular proposer and that's kind of in between the relay and the validators in this situation that's not quite the same. So you have a private mempool within the optimism stack. And what. I don't know the exact details, but what our builders should be doing is looking at this private mempool and running the builder logic to kind of create this sequencing block and that gets passed on to maybe the set of validators to validate. Maybe there's a proposer in there. I'm not exactly sure if they figured that part out yet. And then that will go to the sequencer.
00:28:54.993 - 00:29:27.185, Speaker A: Gotcha. So experiment, potential experimentation still happening around some of the details. Because that's it sounds. I'm aware that like privacy and making sure that submissions or just like execution on these things is private and that enables collaboration between actors that are oppositional. Is that. Am I still in the right direction there?
00:29:28.445 - 00:29:58.915, Speaker C: But I think, I think it also matter at the end of the day because it will. It's also. One has to look at the. What the proposer will do with the, with the block that is coming from. From the builder, even if it is run in a Te. Right. If the proposer can not touch it and deliver it, put it like commit to it as is or is able to add further stuff or sensor or add more transactions or.
00:30:00.095 - 00:30:06.295, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not sure there's a proposal in the L2 system. I think it just goes directly from the.
00:30:06.455 - 00:30:16.225, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is replacing the sequencer and that's correct. Okay. Oh, that's nice. Right. And I guess the only problem in a way will be spamming.
00:30:18.045 - 00:30:24.045, Speaker B: Yes, I think that's the problem with all of the L2s. Yeah, for sure there's definitely going to be spamming. Yeah.
00:30:24.165 - 00:30:39.161, Speaker C: But depending on the strategy. Right. Because if you have first team first, first thing, first served, there may be the spamming problem. But then if you have. If you go for an auction. Right. That can mitigate a bit the.
00:30:39.161 - 00:30:46.857, Speaker C: The spamming or at least you try and solve the spamming situation. If you have a priority auction. Yes.
00:30:46.921 - 00:30:48.553, Speaker B: The time boost, something similar.
00:30:48.609 - 00:30:50.605, Speaker C: Yes, yes, exactly. Exactly.
00:30:51.945 - 00:31:04.425, Speaker A: Do you know if uni. Do you know if unichain is planning to move toward an auction or if you can share. I know that there's a lot under development right now, Tessa, with flash blocks and the like, so.
00:31:04.545 - 00:31:19.005, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think so. Not within the optimism stack. I think optimism stack is pretty. Pretty set. I think. I think what they can only do is maybe kind of give these pre conf equivalents with the flash blocks.
00:31:20.505 - 00:31:27.405, Speaker A: Gotcha. And could you say more about the pre confs and how that's working with flash blocks?
00:31:28.505 - 00:32:10.225, Speaker B: Well, flash blocks are essentially a pre configuration because we have the state at the end of that block and then that little flash block gets pushed down to the validators. So in that sense, you know what, the state's going to be at the end of that flash block. So it's sort of a pre conf. And then when it finally goes down to L1, that's when it's truly kind of on chain invalidated. So it's operating as a precomp. Because as soon as that flash block is completed and you know the state, then we can give receipt notices or whatever notices to transaction users or projects or dapps.
00:32:10.885 - 00:32:17.945, Speaker A: And is this how Unichain is able to go so fast, using pre confs in the flash blocks?
00:32:18.925 - 00:32:35.355, Speaker B: Yeah, I wouldn't say pre comps in the flash blocks. Treat the flash blocks as pre comps and yeah, because we're giving states in between the normal optimism block. That's where the pre conf.
00:32:35.695 - 00:32:46.911, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. So allowing submission of transactions in between optimism blocks which are I'm not sure what the block time on optimism is.
00:32:47.103 - 00:32:48.591, Speaker B: It's two seconds.
00:32:48.743 - 00:32:53.875, Speaker A: Two seconds. Great. Okay, cool. And so that's how you all are getting your millisecond. Very interesting.
00:32:54.035 - 00:32:56.483, Speaker B: Oh, wait, sorry. I think it's one second. I take that back.
00:32:56.619 - 00:33:24.595, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, some. Some smaller than 12 seconds, let's say. And could you say what the impact on MEV will be on that? Because right now, so it's like L2s are cheap, so spamming and then they're generally first in, first out. And so you all are shortening the block time beneath like sub one second. And, and we have tees like how is this gonna. Or how do you think this will impact meb?
00:33:26.415 - 00:34:13.505, Speaker B: Well, just the fact that you're sort of shortening block times, that should reduce the price slippage between moves within CEFI and DeFi. So you're gonna have less like sex decks, arbitrage opportunities, or even between cross chain opportunities that should be less. I don't know for sure how it affects in other ways. You know, L2 has probably different mev than on L1. And until there's better data, like, we really don't know what's happening in a lot of the private mempools currently being run on, you know, these optimism chains. So it's hard to kind of gauge. Okay, is, are.
00:34:13.505 - 00:34:57.082, Speaker B: Is it being, you know, is there any reorgs or bundling happening within the sequencer? Are people bribing sequencers? And, you know, I think there's rumors of it, but I haven't seen any actual proven research. There has been a paper by Kristoff and the East, I think Zurich guys where there's some mev that exploits bridging between L1 ones and L2s. So that's a different, you know, that's sort of a cross chain kind of arbitrage in that sense as well. But again, they're seeing a transaction happen in L1 and they're going to get up front of it in L2 and just start spamming the hell out of the L2. So.
00:34:57.218 - 00:35:23.027, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. It's like as a, as a. Because things are so cheap on L2, you can, you can guess that, that a price movement will happen and you can try to do Solana style. Because that's, that's what I'm aware of is the, they know a sex price movement happens and people spam to try to get ahead of it. Is this is right correct?
00:35:23.211 - 00:35:30.585, Speaker B: Yeah, that's just hft. Like it's just low latency. Right. You're just trying to be the fastest in there.
00:35:31.885 - 00:35:54.905, Speaker A: Got it, got it. Any just to touch base with Denisa, any reflections as we talk about some of these different components? I know that like you've highlighted consensus protocol designers meeting with the economists and traders to make sure that.
00:35:55.725 - 00:36:19.375, Speaker C: Oh yeah. Oh that one. So anyway, speaking about the cross chain mev right. I don't know. I think I'm not an MEV perspective, right. But a big problem there is the non atomic nature of of all this flow of the information. Right.
00:36:19.375 - 00:37:03.373, Speaker C: But then I think it will be very interesting and I think we're gonna, we're going to see some more transparent maybe I hope activity and the MEV on L2s will not be so OPAC because of the. Because they somehow I think roll ups they realize because of several reasons that they should decentralize. Right. Most of the roll ups are aware of this and they should align if they are scaling solutions for Ethereum. Right. And I think so there are several reasons why you want to do this. First of all you have a single point of failure and you don't want to have a single point of failure in anything.
00:37:03.373 - 00:37:53.711, Speaker C: Right? But then there is okay, even if reputation for L2s is a very important factor and at a certain point it. Let's hope but maybe there are scenarios in which this will be out of door control because they are geographically entities that they are tightened to some regulations that can happen. You don't know, right. So if you decentralize geographically you will not be tied to a specific geographic location. So that leverage then there is also if you have just one entity like a single point of course it's more sustainable like you can try and do more attacks on one single entity instead of just going for decentralized. So we are all here for decentralization. This is what we believe in.
00:37:53.711 - 00:38:52.277, Speaker C: Right? But then a single entity is also more corruptible and that's also what that one has to take into account. Right. And because of this probably MEV on lpus let's hope it will become more transparent and more visible. But going back to what you are asking me John is yeah if you go cross chain arbitrage in this scenario is okay if you have access to Pre confirmations on L1, right. And you are a sequencer on a roll up like a tendermint, you are part of the 200, right? And if you have a pre confirmation from a Dex and you can put your own transaction there and then you are able to to see how the. You have the Full authority on how, on how the transactions will be in a block and in what order. Right.
00:38:52.277 - 00:39:02.505, Speaker C: And you'll not have all the MEV mitigation that you have on the L1, right. That's a lot of power. Am I making sense here?
00:39:02.885 - 00:39:03.717, Speaker A: You sure?
00:39:03.861 - 00:39:06.911, Speaker C: I heard people are not so scared of this scenario.
00:39:07.093 - 00:39:24.255, Speaker A: I. Yeah, I think this is, this is some of the interesting. It reflects to some of the interesting. Take that there, that there that Tesla shared that there may be prioritization happening.
00:39:24.755 - 00:39:59.279, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we will have, we will see more sophisticated MEV on the, on the, on the. When the roll ups will decentralize, right? And I think it's very important for roll ups when they will decentralize. Either if they go base or home rule, they should make sure they have a healthy sequencing strategy and everyone aligns with this, right. In order to avoid. So these for sure can help with this. Like you can't touch it. They will follow the specs, they will order the transactions in the order they are asked.
00:39:59.279 - 00:40:21.543, Speaker C: But if you have a single entity that is. No, sorry. If you have an entity that will be a proposer and they can do whatever they want and no one controls them, okay. Reputation is important and they will care about the healthy of the chain. I got this right. But I think having a sequencing strategy, it will be good. There's that.
00:40:21.543 - 00:41:26.035, Speaker C: And then going back to what you were saying, I think everyone agrees we need better consensus protocols. We have wonderful consensus protocols like Gasper and Casper. They're extremely beautiful protocols and they have a very strong economic finality and they're super secure for roll ups. They will not use. It will be quite hard for them to create the network of stake. Right? There are some solutions out there, but to create a network of stakers, it's a lot of effort, right? And okay, if every roll up and okay, if you go base, it may be easy, but if you want to keep your economics and your tokenomics around in your roll up, probably you will go home rule. And for that you will need stakers, right? And if you look at the problem, okay, tendermint or any PBFT consensus protocol, they are wonderful protocols, but they come from distributed computing, right.
00:41:26.035 - 00:42:22.185, Speaker C: They try to solve some specific problems and then you add the tokenomics on top of these protocols, right? You MEV appeared after you use you, you look at the consensus protocol. It's like you find some game that you can do. And I think it would be very nice if we put the energy on trying to build, to build consensus protocols that also take from the beginning also the rational players and game theory and combine come up with a consensus protocol that builds solve the distributed computing problem, but at the same time the game theory and take into account rational players. So you'll have them align at the same level, not add. Add it on top of how you deal with the distributed computer.
00:42:23.645 - 00:43:31.135, Speaker A: So I'm just going to circle all that back is that the issue is that some of the consensus protocols were designed without economic players in mind. And I think then this kind of highlights what Tess was talking about of if the data is opaque, you can get actors can act however they want. And then highlighting Tessa's point, which is. Or I'm sorry, Denise's point, which is we need to make sure protocols and information is transparent so that actors act in alignment with the protocol and all the different players at stake. And ultimately because it reminds me of some of. I knew that in the earlier Ethereum days this is even where the term came from minor extractable value is miners were colluding and I think maybe in Bitcoin too. My bitcoin history is a bit rough, but I think the big circle back is we have to have protocols and transparency to make sure that all these players act fair.
00:43:32.755 - 00:43:39.163, Speaker C: Probably we will encounter other beasts and other problems. Right. But yeah, you learn by doing.
00:43:39.259 - 00:43:48.015, Speaker A: I don't know any reflections on that. That Tessa. And then we're going to move into questions as just like the last item.
00:43:48.475 - 00:44:09.185, Speaker B: Oh no, I agree. I think, you know, if you look at bitcoin today, the miners do have a lot of power and there is MEV that's being extracted on Bitcoin. So yeah, I don't, I don't know the answer for Denisa on like how do you separate economic incentives from the validators. But that, yeah, that is definitely a consideration.
00:44:11.245 - 00:44:44.095, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So I've got, I've got. I have one question that was messaged to me directly and it. And they said they heard from Ed Felton. They said that L1 proposers are working for themselves, whereas L2 sequencing is serving L2 users. They see centralized sequencers not doing MEV, even though they are in a privileged situation. And is this the same equilibrium for L2 sequencing MEV? So a sophisticated question actually.
00:44:44.095 - 00:44:49.585, Speaker A: And Tessa or Denisa either can feel free.
00:44:51.125 - 00:45:08.037, Speaker B: I think, you know, Ed's quite right. I think the centralized sequencers of the bigger. Of the bigger chains have a lot of reputational risk. Right. Just because they're not doing MEV doesn't mean that MEV doesn't exist. So that that's number one. It could still exist in especially in an optimism.
00:45:08.037 - 00:45:21.855, Speaker B: Stack Arbitrum. I think they're dealing with it their own separate way. But yeah, I think he's right. If. If you have. If you are a big L2, your reputation is. Is worth more than MEV.
00:45:21.855 - 00:45:39.809, Speaker B: Right? MEV is not that much like currently, I think on. Even on base with the most transaction volumes. Most of that is from gaming from NFTs. It's not so much from actual swaps. So the MEV there is actually rather limited. But yeah, somebody's still collecting it.
00:45:39.977 - 00:46:07.865, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Centralized sequencer, they are amazing for users. Right. It gives a user experience, a very good user experience. But then at the same time, if the users can't withdraw their money whatever they want, like if they don't have no escape pages like in case of something bad happens. I don't know is that you sleep good on that or. I don't know, you're muted.
00:46:08.165 - 00:46:10.509, Speaker A: Oh yeah, we're right back into tradfi.
00:46:10.637 - 00:46:14.385, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, exactly. We do just circles. It's good. We like circles.
00:46:14.925 - 00:46:36.915, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. Okay, let me check. Do we have any. It doesn't look like we have any more questions. I think I'd love to end on maybe a. A fun question which is do you think MEV is solvable? Let's start with Tessa.
00:46:38.735 - 00:47:00.465, Speaker B: I guess I think it always comes down to what is your definition of solvable. I think it exists. It just moves from one party to the next. If you define solvable as being returned to the end user, then yes, you can do that. In Tradify, it's called payment for order to flow. Is that great? You know it's hit or miss, right. They might have a little bit worse execution or.
00:47:00.465 - 00:47:23.477, Speaker B: But they have no fees to pay. So, you know, that's great too. So net net, that actually might be a better result for the user. Right. In that situation. Also within, I think L2 space, you know, it might be the same thing. And also with like Unichain, I think there's going to be various ways for them to capture the mev.
00:47:23.477 - 00:47:47.325, Speaker B: How that gets redistributed back to the users is a question. They're offering no revert transaction costs, which is great. That could introduce other consequences that we don't know about quite yet. But you know, that exists currently today with MEV protect. So it might be a little bit different on a chain that you can just spam with zero costs. But you know, there's pros and cons. We're not.
00:47:47.325 - 00:47:51.559, Speaker B: We're not exactly sure. So yeah. Hard to say.
00:47:51.727 - 00:48:08.875, Speaker C: Yeah. I think it's a complex also. Complex. If you are a newbie like me and you, you get into MV and you learn that there are different types of. Right. So I guess we maybe want to eliminate toxic. Right.
00:48:08.875 - 00:48:31.453, Speaker C: And yeah, I think people are putting a lot of effort into this. But then I think always even if you let's say solve this one or patch it, others other part, other problems or phenomenons or consequences can appear. Right. And it's just life. You have to adjust and see what you can do at that point. Right.
00:48:31.509 - 00:48:57.233, Speaker A: So yeah and I certainly agree and I love the nuanced answers from both of you. All that. That's very perfectly and well said and I see some of the comments is, you know, it's Mev is not a problem and value needs to flow. Agree with all these things. I just, I like I wanted to kind of end on a. Something out of a. Of a maybe unsolvable question or we.
00:48:57.249 - 00:49:00.525, Speaker C: Don'T want to get bored. Right. We want problems. So it's fine.
00:49:00.985 - 00:49:04.169, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. Maybe we gotta have stuff to do.
00:49:04.337 - 00:49:05.125, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:05.865 - 00:49:24.355, Speaker A: Well I. So I think that's it. I super appreciate both of you joining us here to talk about mev.l2mev. Any final comments or shout outs you want to give Tessa or Denisa?
00:49:25.895 - 00:49:33.555, Speaker C: Well, I super enjoy this and thanks a lot for organizing and Tessai, it is nice. It's lovely meeting you.
00:49:34.415 - 00:49:45.715, Speaker B: Same to to say thanks to John Ice Cool and Nethermind and Denise, pleasure to meet with you. Definitely want to hear more about starknet from you and learn more about the different consensus solutions.
00:49:46.575 - 00:49:47.395, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:47.855 - 00:50:16.467, Speaker B: If you're interested in TE stuff, just follow. You know, Flashbust doesn't have a Twitter account, but there's enough Flashbots members within Twitter. Andrew Miller is like the godfather of te. So definitely give him a follow and I already do. Yeah, we have a lot of shenanigans. I think if you haven't heard about tehi, you know, that's something you should keep following. I think we get.
00:50:16.467 - 00:50:35.055, Speaker B: I think they get the account access back in like T minus six days maybe. Who knows. I don't know when the clock started of them getting banned, but there's definitely a lot of TE stuff that fast flashbacks are doing. So just kind of watch, watch our mates. And if you need a mate list, I have. I finally made a list on Twitter. I've gone.
00:50:37.355 - 00:50:38.255, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:50:39.195 - 00:51:02.045, Speaker A: Check out defi Noob with noobs spelled with zeros. And also the Flashbots forum is a great place. Also, check us out on our nethermind Stark Twitter. But that's a wrap, everybody. Thank you all so much for joining us and I had a lot of fun. I hope everybody learned something. I hope you all have a great weekend.
