00:00:03.050 - 00:00:40.758, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. I'm Anna, marketing and business development executive at Nettermind. And together with William, who is our marketing and partnership intern, we will be hosting today's Q A. So welcome and big thanks to our audience and our speakers for joining us today. We will have a great panel, Matt from Tilt team from Oturium foundation and Barbane from Oterium foundation as well. So to set the scene, maybe let's start off with a brief introduction from our speakers, starting with Matt, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your background?
00:00:40.934 - 00:01:06.530, Speaker B: Sure. Thanks, Anna. Hi, my name is Matt. I usually go by light client on the Internet. I work on a small team called Quilt. We're just about four people right now, and we do a lot of core development, core research. I personally work on some client development, some EIP development, and yeah, we've been doing this for about a year now.
00:01:06.530 - 00:01:23.960, Speaker B: Before that, we did a lot of work on e two, phase two. So we spent a long time thinking about how to communicate across shards and how to execute code in the Ethereum two world. And now we're kind of working a little bit closer on things that are happening on mainnet right now.
00:01:26.490 - 00:01:30.570, Speaker A: Okay, great. And Barnaba, could you tell us also a little bit about yourself?
00:01:30.720 - 00:01:58.930, Speaker C: All right, so my name is Barnabe. I am a researcher at the Ethereum foundation. More specifically, I work for the robust incentives group, which is a smaller research team dedicated to look at things that have more of a game theoretic flavor. So, like mechanism design, crypto economics, these sorts of things. So far I've been working mostly on EIP 1559 and some parts of proof of stake.
00:02:01.430 - 00:02:24.522, Speaker A: Okay, great. Thank you very much. So let's start maybe with the presentation that you guys had or will have on ECC. Could you give us a view from Mont Everest about what was your topic and what did you cover? And I know, Matt, that you will be probably presenting tomorrow, so maybe you can tell us what it will be about.
00:02:24.656 - 00:03:24.186, Speaker B: Yeah, so I am giving a presentation tomorrow with Onscar, my coworker, and we're going to be discussing an EIP 30 74. This is an EIP that our team, quilts, has been working on for quite a while. It actually started last summer during some discussions about gas changes that might affect how metatransactions work on Ethereum. And there was an idea that maybe we can have an EIP that unbreak some of the functionality that may have been broken with these discussed proposals. That kind of led me into writing an EIP 27 33, which would bring sponsored transactions into the protocol. And my coworker, Sam Wilson, who was the original author of 30 74, didn't like how I approached the problem and felt that he had actually had a better approach. So he wrote his approach in the winter of last year and was able to convince me that it was a better approach.
00:03:24.186 - 00:04:15.870, Speaker B: And so since then, we've kind of done some iterations on it. We've moved it. Originally it was this idea of having a pre compile where you would send a signature, and if the signature was valid, then it would send out a call based on the address that was recovered from the signature. And now we've moved it to become an EIP that introduces two opcodes, one that recovers a signature, and one that makes a call based on the signature that was recovered. And so we'll talk about it tomorrow. The specification itself is pretty simple, and in fact, Anscar led a workshop today where people actually fully implemented the EIP and geth in about an hour. And so tomorrow we'll talk about all of the nuance that comes with the security, things that can arise.
00:04:17.330 - 00:04:22.400, Speaker A: That sounds great. Can't wait to watch the presentation. Yeah. Hi, Tim.
00:04:23.570 - 00:04:25.554, Speaker D: Oh, hey everyone. Can you hear me?
00:04:25.672 - 00:04:39.480, Speaker A: Yeah, we can hear you. So we've been talking about, first a short introduction to all of the speakers, and then we were talking about the presentation on EFT that was happening. So could you tell us a little bit about yourself?
00:04:40.090 - 00:05:13.540, Speaker D: Sure. So, my name is Tim Baco. I work with the Ethereum foundation. The main part of my role is I run the all core devs calls, which are calls where different client teams who want to make changes to the protocol, like the ones Matt was just discussing, come together and discuss those. Aside from that, I was a heavy Twitter user, so much so that I deleted the app from my phone to try and limit the amount of time I spent on Twitter. And now I've just redownloaded it to join this space for the first time in five years.
00:05:15.110 - 00:05:18.020, Speaker A: No, sorry to make you redownloading it.
00:05:18.470 - 00:05:22.514, Speaker D: No worries. Yeah. If I'm addicted to Twitter again, that's on you.
00:05:22.632 - 00:05:26.580, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, that will be our fault. Well, you can delete it after the Q A.
00:05:27.190 - 00:05:28.740, Speaker E: Isn't that all of us?
00:05:31.130 - 00:05:36.280, Speaker A: Could you tell us a little bit about your presentation? It was yesterday. It was really nice.
00:05:36.650 - 00:06:19.170, Speaker D: Yeah. So the talk I gave yesterday was about kind of the history of 1559. So EIP 1559 is a big change that's coming to the Ethereum main net, and there's been a lot of presentations that kind of go over it and explain the actual change. But one thing that's interesting about it, it is like a pretty old change, as it was formally proposed three years ago now. But the first discussions go back almost five years. So my talk kind of went over that, like how it kind of went from an idea to actually getting proposed on Ethereum to then getting implemented as a proof of concept and kind of fleshed out a bit more tested and eventually deployed to Mainnet.
00:06:20.410 - 00:06:27.510, Speaker A: Okay. And could you tell me, because I was actually very curious, what was the hardest part of the journey?
00:06:30.010 - 00:07:28.922, Speaker D: So I wasn't involved the whole time. I actually started working on this kind of pretty. Not necessarily full time, but having it be one of my main focus at HCC in 2020. I think since then, one of the biggest challenges was to try and replicate the conditions of Mainnet, not on Mainnet. And this is something that the engineers on the Besu team worked on a lot, but they basically had to build a lot of tooling that could create kind of fake Ethereum networks that were as big as Mainnet to try and see how the EIP would perform, would perform under mainnet conditions. So that was a big one. I think the other big challenge we've had with 1559 is it's a very complex change that has a lot of implications, and it's hard to explain it to people in a way that they read about it for the first time and now they understand it.
00:07:28.922 - 00:08:01.800, Speaker D: It feels like for me and for most people I've seen try to understand this, you kind of need to go over it like five or six times to have a really good understanding of how it works and how it affects things. And so trying to find the right way to bring people, whether it's application developers, wallet developers, other obviously protocol engineers, but bringing people down that rabbit hole and figuring out what's the best way to lay things out so that it's actually clear. That's been pretty challenging as well.
00:08:02.490 - 00:08:13.834, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds super challenging. Okay, so, Barnaba, can you hear me now? Could you tell us a little bit about your presentation? I also watched it, and it was also really good.
00:08:14.032 - 00:08:36.814, Speaker C: Oh, thank you. So I gave two presentations, actually, at EFCC. The first one I gave was at the french track. As you can tell from my accent, I am french, though I'm not in Paris at the moment. So we went over kind of recent upgrades to Ethereum. So Berlin, London, the beacon chain. I wasn't alone.
00:08:36.814 - 00:09:02.810, Speaker C: There was three other speakers who were also researchers for ethereum or client teams. That was my first presentation, my second presentation. I just gave a brief overview of the kind of work that we've done at the robust incentives groups. So present our simulations, present our kind of methodology, and also present this new economic model developed by one of our grantees at the EF.
00:09:04.430 - 00:09:11.326, Speaker A: Okay, great. Thank you very much. So how was the experience of ECC joining online? Not to be able to go there.
00:09:11.348 - 00:09:22.880, Speaker D: In person, not as good as going in person. Not that the online experience is bad, but I really feel FOMO for not being there in person.
00:09:23.830 - 00:09:48.022, Speaker B: I think being in person is amazing for the side conversations, but I've actually watched some of the talks online even though I'm here, or like recordings of them, and they have done a really good job. So at least the core material people are getting really well. But it's like you can't really put a true value on seeing everybody face to face, the people that you work with.
00:09:48.076 - 00:10:01.850, Speaker D: Yeah, I will give it a plus one to that. I've been impressed how well set up the online stuff is and how quickly the talks have been available afterwards. Yeah, that's been really well done by the organizers.
00:10:02.590 - 00:10:19.860, Speaker C: It's very fantastic. And I would say EFCC. I went to the second edition last year already. I skipped it because COVID seemed to be on the, and ECC was really one of the best conferences I've attended and I'm really disappointed that I couldn't make it this year as well.
00:10:20.310 - 00:10:24.210, Speaker A: And Matt, are you able to be in Paris right now for EFCC?
00:10:24.790 - 00:10:26.210, Speaker B: I am in Paris, yes.
00:10:26.280 - 00:10:26.466, Speaker E: Oh.
00:10:26.488 - 00:10:28.450, Speaker A: And how is it? How is FCC?
00:10:29.210 - 00:10:53.950, Speaker B: It's been great. The venue is the same one as last year. It's amazing. I think yesterday I talked to like two, three dozen people that I either met with on person or acquaintances of acquaintances. And it's just been really great getting to put faces on people that I've only met online and then meeting new people and discussing things over coffee and meals.
00:10:54.610 - 00:10:57.710, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds amazing, especially after COVID.
00:10:59.170 - 00:11:18.310, Speaker E: Yeah, that's like two dozen more people than I met. Yeah. And what are the main block? I guess moving on to more Ethereum based questions, what are the main blockers for getting upgrades done? And especially this is a little bit relevant to you, Tim, but what's being done to streamline the process for EIP development and implementation?
00:11:19.530 - 00:12:40.570, Speaker D: So you might not like the answer to this question, but I think we're not necessarily trying to streamline the process as well as much as like providing more clarity. And I suspect the main challenge of making upgrades to Ethereum is just that the network grows and the community grows. And as that happens, it becomes harder and harder to get everybody to come to consensus on changes and to think through the impact of changes across the entire ecosystem. So I don't think there's really a magic thing we can do where upgrades just happen quicker. And I think realistically they'll probably start happening slower and slower as the network matures. That being said, we do have a pretty ambitious roadmap at the core protocol level for Ethereum. And I think one thing I've been trying to work on to streamline the upgrade process is trying to figure out what are the big things in that roadmap, like the things that really matter, things like obviously getting the merge to proof of stake, dealing with state growth, getting sharding eventually, and trying to focus on how can we set those things in our roadmap first and then try to fit all of the other kind of smaller initiatives.
00:12:40.570 - 00:13:21.680, Speaker D: Because historically, I think the way we've gone about things, we kind of focus on small things first just because they're sometimes easier to reason about or think through. And that means that sometimes bigger initiatives that are more valuable but potentially more complex and harder to approach or reason about don't get as much attention. Yeah, so I'd say it's not necessarily as much as about streamlining as about given that we know this process is going to be slow, how do we make sure the time and effort we're spending is on the highest importance things.
00:13:22.610 - 00:13:43.538, Speaker E: Okay, considering that question, I should probably not ask the next question, but I'll ask it anyway. So I'm a big fan of speed runs and watching, especially watching some of the stuff. And how quickly could you speed run like any percent from EIP, from idea to main net, try to sneak a.
00:13:43.544 - 00:13:48.420, Speaker B: Bug into another EIP, fix it.
00:13:50.470 - 00:14:02.810, Speaker D: To be clear. Right. If something is important, and this morning there was an issue found on Robston, we can get a fix for that out in a day.
00:14:02.880 - 00:14:03.162, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:03.216 - 00:14:24.740, Speaker D: I think the fact that we're doing things slowly does not mean that we're unable to do things fast when there's a clear and clear fix that we need to do. So. Yeah. If it was a security concern, you could probably get it implemented in a day, tested and released out within a few days.
00:14:25.910 - 00:14:49.500, Speaker E: Okay, that's pretty interesting. And I guess another thought is just like what are potential disruptors to the stability of Ethereum? This is sort of more open ended question. I don't know, stuff that might disrupt our tranquility. I'll start off with Matt, since Tim has done a lot of the talking.
00:14:51.150 - 00:15:45.530, Speaker B: That's a really good question. I was actually just trying to ponder the things that would upset the tranquility of mean. I think the whole Mev reorg thing, that was definitely rocking the boat to a degree. There is kind of this fine line that exists between things that are admissible by the protocol and things that the community generally is against. And like my coworker Anskar likes to say that reorgang the blockchain is generally something that crosses the line of things that people are okay with. And I think that begins to disrupt the tranquility of Ethereum, even though it's fully admissible by the protocol. It's something that's kind of frowned upon.
00:15:45.530 - 00:16:41.200, Speaker B: I don't know. I think, on a more meta level, I think I really liked Vitalik's talk today. There's a lot of things that are interesting outside DeFi, and I think that the amount of value being created in Defi is, to a degree, know, messing with the tranquility of Ethereum. It's kind of hard now to cut through what's real and the actual technical merits of things, because there's a lot of money involved, and there's a lot of money involved if you can convert an idea into something that a lot of people buy into, even if the idea is not technically superior or is a similar idea that other people have, but you name it, something different, or tweak something. And so that's something that I found, like, a little frustrating a couple of years ago. It was a lot easier to really see exactly what was happening.
00:16:42.050 - 00:16:43.434, Speaker E: All right, Barnaby?
00:16:43.562 - 00:17:15.590, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to go with the MeV Reorg stuff as well. But more generally, I think looking at how different entities are kind of forming. So I'm thinking of flashbots, for instance. There's many positive aspects to this. For instance, they make it much easier to separate out people who want very precise positions in blocks versus people who only care for inclusion. And that definitely seemed to have appeased the gas market a bit. So maybe more tranquility on this side.
00:17:15.590 - 00:17:39.680, Speaker C: But on the other hand, the idea that a certain amount of hash power is in the hands of not necessarily one entity, and it's an entity that I think is really outspoken about doing things that are in the interest of Ethereum as well. But beyond this, I think it's important to keep in mind that this exists and we are actually trying to do better.
00:17:40.210 - 00:18:09.580, Speaker D: Yeah. And one thing I'll add to that is it feels like when incentives are not aligned across the entire ecosystem. That's like, what causes these disruptions? That's one thing over the past year that's gotten me so much more excited about the transition to proof of stake. Even though incentives are maybe not perfectly aligned under proof of stake between everyone in the ecosystem, they are to a greater degree than, I think, what we have now with proof of work.
00:18:10.270 - 00:18:10.682, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:18:10.736 - 00:18:30.430, Speaker D: So I think most disruptions kind of come from a spot where people are maybe like 80% incentive to line, and then there's like a 20% where they can exploit and benefit. And I think we reduce the amount of edge cases there under proof of stake. And that's really valuable.
00:18:30.850 - 00:18:48.790, Speaker E: Yeah. All right, so some really good, really solid responses. And I guess another issue that I was thinking about is a potential disruptor, although I think there's a less potential because it's so far off. But how does Ethereum and a lot of other blockchains respond and tokens respond to quantum computing?
00:18:49.130 - 00:18:52.230, Speaker D: I don't know anything about quantum computing.
00:18:52.890 - 00:18:54.760, Speaker C: I'll pass on this as well.
00:18:55.610 - 00:19:48.620, Speaker B: I think that if quantum computing can really break the cryptographic primitives that we use, it's going to be very bad, and I think it's going to be very bad for us and for bitcoin and really the entire Internet. I mean, pretty much everything you use on a daily basis is based on some sort of cryptography that might be able to be factored quickly with quantum computers. And if somebody finds a machine that can do the factoring very quickly, then I think Ethereum is really one of the things that may not even be the top of the list for them to go after. And that's why this is part of the long term roadmap of Ethereum, is to find ways to move away from things that are not quantum resistant. But I don't think we expect that to become a serious concern for the next decade at least.
00:19:49.230 - 00:20:06.800, Speaker E: Okay. And speaking about that long term roadmap, what's next for Ethereum? If we were to have Ethereum 3.0, or if you know what the real name is, just please Alpha, leak it out. But yeah, what's on the roadmap for Ethereum 3.0?
00:20:08.050 - 00:20:59.450, Speaker D: So I can maybe take that starting from today and gradually going into the future. I mean, in like two weeks, we're going to have an upgrade on the current Ethereum chain, which brings the IP 1559 and a bunch of other changes. Then on the consensus layer side, they're going to have another upgrade this summer and sometime late next year, early next year, we're hoping to merge the current beacon chain with the current EVM chain, which we call the merge. And that'll be kind of the transition from e one and e two being separate things to the whole system working together from there. There's kind of two big things in the medium term that we need to do. One is dealing with state growth. So basically, the fact that when you store data on Ethereum, it stays there forever.
00:20:59.450 - 00:21:48.586, Speaker D: And so there's an ever increasing amount of data that's stored on the network, and that just creates a pretty high burden for nodes to stand the network. So we want to come up with ways to deprecate data or expire it when it gets old, but still allow people to bring it back if they want access to that. In parallel to that, we also want to add sharding to Ethereum. So to add data shards to the network, which roll ups can then use to store data much cheaper than storing on the current execution charts. So that's probably like the next two, three years of work. I think beyond that, the two things that are being looked at right now are adding better privacy. So technology around zero knowledge proofs and whatnot.
00:21:48.586 - 00:21:58.514, Speaker D: So if we could have some level of privacy potentially at the base layer of the protocol, and quantum resistance, which is maybe like a 510 year thing.
00:21:58.552 - 00:21:59.140, Speaker B: Out.
00:22:03.590 - 00:22:13.880, Speaker E: How would you implement zk stuff? Because isn't zk stuff like all about layer twos, or. I don't know. I'm trying to get my head around that.
00:22:14.570 - 00:23:00.246, Speaker D: So right now, the implementations are on layer twos. There's obviously a few blockchains that have layer one implementations of zero knowledge. But I think, and I'm not an expert here, the idea is, as those implementations get tested on layer two, and if we can have kind of zero knowledge EVM computations and be confident in those, eventually we might want to move those just as part of the core protocol. Right, like where it wouldn't have to live on layer two, but you could just benefit from it. The biggest challenge is, obviously this technology is still very early, and there's still kind of issues that get found in it from time to time. So before we move it into the base protocol, we want to be sure that it's much more battle tested than it is now.
00:23:00.428 - 00:23:34.546, Speaker C: There's a lot of things you can add to the protocol to do more efficiently if you have access to. So the zero knowledge part is what gives you privacy, but the snark part is what gives you these succinct proofs of computations. For instance, what you can do is attach to any block that is on the network a proof that the block is valid. And so you can make light clients, for instance, way more efficient. They can have this proof that the block is indeed valid when they receive it.
00:23:34.728 - 00:23:36.820, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that's true.
00:23:37.510 - 00:23:57.400, Speaker E: All right, so that's pretty cool regarding all the privacy stuff, but this is sort of a more broader question, especially for people that are newer to the space. How does someone get involved in Ethereum research? Maybe you can briefly touch on your story and how you got ethereum research.
00:24:00.910 - 00:25:08.160, Speaker B: I guess I can talk about kind of how I got involved. I would say, like in terms of people doing Ethereum research, I'm on the newer end. I really got involved at the beginning of 2019, and it turned out that I was kind of working this crypto product called Bounties Network. And one of the things that frustrated myself whenever I was more of a DAP developer was that even if someday we launch, post and goes onto hacker news or on one of these sites and the app blows up and we get 10,000 users, all of a sudden the Ethereum network couldn't really handle that kind of scale. And it couldn't handle it not only in terms of the bandwidth of really web scale applications, but also just like the UX at the time, and still to a degree, today just wasn't where it needed to be. And so that was like a frustrating thing as a developer. And then I had the opportunity.
00:25:10.370 - 00:25:10.782, Speaker C: To.
00:25:10.836 - 00:26:19.346, Speaker B: Start this small team called, quote, with another developer called Global on the WevA. And we kind of took this weird path where we started looking at Ethereum research, some first principles coming the opposite direction from far future e two related research. And so I guess to make that useful for people trying to get into this space, we spent a reasonable amount of time just trying to understand how do these virtual machines work? What does it mean to have a state transition function in Ethereum? And I don't think we had any kind of special favors done for us. We were fortunate to be funded to do this. And if you're doing research or you're wanting to get into research and you need funding, there are people at consensus, people at the Ethereum foundation who are willing to help sponsor that to get started or whatever. But we spent a lot of time as kind of outsiders, and we just posted on the places that the Ethereum researchers interact with. And back then, that was like e three search and Ethereum magicians.
00:26:19.346 - 00:27:06.030, Speaker B: And now it's still kind of those places, but also a lot on this Ethereum R and d discord. And so it's a very open and collaborative environment. And as you slowly build up your knowledge base and you kind of build up rapport with these people, you also kind of start to become a person who's understanding what the latest thinking of Ethereum is and where people think the Ethereum research is moving and going because it kind of comes in waves. There's like a few months where this is like the latest thing. We think that this is going to be how it's going to happen. And then there's another thing that comes up and it's like, oh, we can't go down that route for that reason. And so I think just generally the moral is that if that's something that you're interested in, you have to start out and you have to kind of learn the basics.
00:27:06.030 - 00:27:26.010, Speaker B: And the way that you do that, there's many ways, whether you go through a technical university or you kind of learn on your own from first principles, whatever, and then you want to try and get involved in discourse where you're at the place where the people are talking. And that's know again, the Ethereum magicians website, Ethernd Discord and the Ethereum research.
00:27:26.080 - 00:27:30.874, Speaker E: Site, Tim Barnaby, you guys just echoing a lot of the same sentiment.
00:27:31.002 - 00:28:27.066, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess this process of osmosis, as Matt describes it, is very much my experience as started. I guess I kind of randomly found it online. And at the time I was doing my PhD in Singapore on game theory and I went to my advisor and told him, hey, there's this really interesting thing, ethereum, like blockchain. And he's like, oh wait, did you say Ethereum? I just met these guys who are working on it and it turned out that these guys were Vitalik and a couple of other early researchers who were in Singapore at the time. And so I just started getting a bit more in touch. I attended the Eve Singapore hackathon where I worked a little on CBC Casper. Over time just build up a bit more research work in parallel of doing my PhD, which was not at all on blockchain.
00:28:27.066 - 00:28:49.560, Speaker C: So yeah, just being divided for a while. And after my PhD, I submitted a kind of research proposal, let's say, to conduct this game theory research at Ethereum. And I think this is something they probably had in mind to do before. So, yeah, finally got funded and joined the EF in January 2020.
00:28:50.650 - 00:28:58.920, Speaker E: All right, that's pretty cool. It seems like the onramp for most people was the grant. And I guess part of that was like really lucky timing as well, Tim.
00:29:01.370 - 00:29:58.422, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I took maybe slightly a different path, I guess also by virtue of not having a super technical role on Ethereum. So I'd been following the space about since the Dow hack got interested in it, after the Dow hack was scared that Ethereum would just completely go away because it felt pretty dead for a while there. But then after that, started seeing late 2016, early seventeen s a bunch of projects launching on Ethereum. So it kind of caught my attention again. In 2017, we had this massive wave of ICOs, and at that point, it felt clear that there was demand for Ethereum. Even if all these ICOs turned out to be scams, then something else would probably come and want to build on Ethereum. So, yeah, at that point, I had been kind of following for a few years, but hadn't been full time involved.
00:29:58.422 - 00:30:37.640, Speaker D: I thought it was kind of hard also because I wasn't like an engineer, I was a product manager. And I guess it took me six ish months. I found a product manager opening at consensus. I applied and I got it. So I was very lucky that they had kind of an opening that fit my skill set and that was on their protocol team. So I got involved kind of slowly in the lcore devs calls, and the process around the protocol changes that way. And then, yeah, after doing that for a couple of years, eventually moved on to the EF, where I still work on the same type of things.
00:30:38.350 - 00:31:11.620, Speaker E: All right, that's a pretty cool story, and why don't we move into some of the more specific questions? I guess this one's for Barnaby. You're working in a robust incentives group, and I saw that post that we had alongside with flashbots, that you had a hand in helping about Mev and how it would be affected by 1559. How much of the robust incentives group is worrying about MeV and how persistent should we expect? Mev after e two?
00:31:12.790 - 00:32:04.558, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a very interesting question. So far, I would say what we've been trying to do at the rig is to worry more about things that could affect the protocol. For instance, we look at DeFi, we kind of understand it, but we don't really devote active research hours to really dig into these protocols. MeV seemed to be this weird application layer phenomenon, but over time, it became really clear that actually, no, it had very important impacts on the protocol itself. The first way, I guess, that I was exposed to it is when I started working on EIP 1559. You would see that the gas market would go crazy because of his priority gas auctions. Flashbots came into the mix.
00:32:04.558 - 00:32:51.362, Speaker C: It's a very interesting set of incentives, very interesting. Let's say almost like a parallel system to the protocol, but that has very strong interactions with it. And so, at this point, I guess it made a lot more sense for us to really dig into it much more rigorously and to think about these effects. And to your second question about the impact of MeV on if two. I think there's a sense that the if two protocol is much more robust to things such as the Reorg. This is because the protocol is set in a much more different way. You don't have these kinds of timing games that you have in proof of work, of an ocean of a hash rate.
00:32:51.362 - 00:33:41.060, Speaker C: You have this random committee selection, which makes the block production and the kind of, let's say, guarantees you have when you publish messages much stronger than in proof of work. But it's still interesting to try and think about it and just make sure that the protocol is really sound. And to do this, we actually, at the moment, doing active collaboration with flashbots. The FRP number is 15. If you dig into the flashbots Mev research repo. And I think it's quite interesting to just get in contact with researchers who think very differently, who have a much more, I guess, adversarial view of a protocol, and really look for ways to break it. Yeah, it's a very nice experience.
00:33:44.070 - 00:34:14.726, Speaker E: Okay. All right, we're going to move on to a segment that I'm going to call long short, and it's a segment that I stole from the Financial Times. Another thing that we're stealing from tradfi. And it's basically sort of a lightning round on whether you're long or short on an idea. And the audience can participate as well. You can put the 100 reaction if you're long, or you can put the laugh reaction if you're short. All right.
00:34:14.726 - 00:34:31.060, Speaker E: Okay. What I'm going to say is, I'm going to repeat a bunch of. I'm not going to repeat, but I'm going to say a bunch of concepts and ideas, and you're going to tell me whether you're long or short on them. And then for certain ones, I'll ask you what your stance on that particular one is. Are you guys ready?
00:34:33.190 - 00:34:33.602, Speaker C: Yes.
00:34:33.656 - 00:34:41.400, Speaker E: Sure. Okay. All right, so the first one, social media on layer two, long short.
00:34:43.050 - 00:34:44.582, Speaker B: Is there anything in between?
00:34:44.716 - 00:34:46.390, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm neutral.
00:34:49.950 - 00:34:50.970, Speaker E: Barnaby.
00:34:53.550 - 00:35:14.800, Speaker C: Oh, I thought we were only giving the emojis. Do I have to give a reason? I guess, yeah. Any attempt to make social networks better and maybe to try and align the incentives a little better is for me long. I have yet to see one that I think catches my attention, but I also think it's very early to tell.
00:35:16.470 - 00:35:20.994, Speaker E: All right, ETH killers short I like.
00:35:21.112 - 00:35:27.190, Speaker B: New ideas and disruptions, but I don't like it being so aggressive and competitive.
00:35:28.570 - 00:35:39.980, Speaker E: All right, looks like the audience agrees as well. But this should be to be expected about an Ethereum conference. Any Ethereum killers that you guys find the most interesting?
00:35:41.710 - 00:36:18.840, Speaker D: I think anything that ends up being like a significant disruptor to Ethereum will not look like ethereum the same way. Ethereum was different from bitcoin. The bitcoin killer was not litecoin, it was Ethereum. I suspect whatever ends up being a competitor or something that takes market's share away from Ethereum will look as different from Ethereum as Ethereum looked from bitcoin. So it won't be just like something running get which some slight modifications and claiming they can reach 10,000 transactions per second.
00:36:21.210 - 00:36:25.398, Speaker E: Okay. All right. Sub 30 Gwe I was going to.
00:36:25.404 - 00:36:51.840, Speaker B: Say, I think that a lot of these interesting quote unquote ETH killers are using the same technology, the same fundamental technology at the bottom. And I think the fundamental thing for ETH two that really helps scale is the data availability sampling. If you look deep down in several of these killers, they are using this technology. And I think this is what is going to make these gen two chains really reach this level of scalability that we need.
00:36:52.770 - 00:36:56.020, Speaker E: Okay, sub 30 gray gas on layer one.
00:36:56.630 - 00:37:00.180, Speaker D: Short. I don't think it sustains for a long time.
00:37:00.710 - 00:37:15.110, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm curious to see what roll ups will bring in terms of the gas prices on layer one. I'm not exactly sure what the dynamics will be, but I don't think we should expect gas to be super low, at least until the data sharding is activated.
00:37:18.810 - 00:37:30.300, Speaker B: I think after data sharding is activated we'll see low gas prices for a little while. But I don't know, I think the long term, there's always going to be more and more desire to have ordered available data.
00:37:31.250 - 00:37:38.270, Speaker E: Okay, so you're short on it. Okay. All right. ETH as ultrasound money. It should be a slam dunk.
00:37:38.690 - 00:37:42.730, Speaker C: I'm pretty short on this actually, Sam.
00:37:42.810 - 00:37:45.090, Speaker E: Oh my. Tim.
00:37:45.240 - 00:37:46.770, Speaker D: I'd say I'm neutral.
00:37:48.630 - 00:37:49.890, Speaker E: Disappointing.
00:37:50.310 - 00:37:52.100, Speaker C: No, Tim, you have the bet.
00:37:52.950 - 00:39:02.842, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think there's value in thinking about how we can improve the economics of Ethereum. I think 1559 in that way, almost like fixes a bug in Ethereum the way I like to put this is if you explain Ethereum to somebody who knows nothing about blockchain, they would assume that the protocol captures value for what's happening on it. Right? It's almost like, I think people who learn about Ethereum without knowing it on a blockchain almost assume there is some 1559 like mechanism already on Ethereum where the more people build on it, for some reason that'll be valuable for Ethereum. And the truth is, before 1559, that's just not the case. And to some extent you can argue there's cases where a lot of demand for the network is actually worse for the economics, because if it just creates really high transaction fees and difficulty on the network increases because of that, it leads to selling pressure for the asset. I think there's probably too big of a focus on the asset from times to times.
00:39:02.842 - 00:39:13.710, Speaker D: But I do think we need to make sure that the economics of the network are sound and 1559 is like a massive step in that direction.
00:39:15.090 - 00:39:53.610, Speaker C: Yeah. If I had to expand a bit on my position, I would say I think it's very important and very cool that the protocol is able to capture the value. I also think burning was a strictly better alternative than redistributing to miners, for instance. But I don't think capturing value and burning are strictly equivalent. There are ways that we could capture the value without necessarily burning it. We could decide to do something else with it. We don't know really how and we don't really have probably ways to do it at scale, which is why maybe burning is a good idea.
00:39:53.610 - 00:40:07.840, Speaker C: But if we focus maybe a bit too much on the burn as a kind of fetishism, as okay, we have to burn it. This is how we capture value. I think we might be missing out on opportunities that could be interesting as well.
00:40:08.210 - 00:40:23.714, Speaker E: Okay, some good responses and I think they're pretty sound as well. Maybe not ultrasound, but all right. E by $4,000 or new all time highs by the end of the year.
00:40:23.832 - 00:40:24.930, Speaker D: No comment.
00:40:28.410 - 00:40:30.402, Speaker E: Cop out. Cop out. Barnaby.
00:40:30.466 - 00:40:32.360, Speaker C: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question.
00:40:33.530 - 00:40:35.160, Speaker E: ETH by 4000.
00:40:36.410 - 00:40:38.140, Speaker C: ETH by 4000.
00:40:39.390 - 00:40:44.620, Speaker E: Yeah, US dollars. We're going to hit new all time highs by the end of the year.
00:40:44.990 - 00:40:46.380, Speaker C: I won't talk price.
00:40:49.230 - 00:40:55.390, Speaker E: Fair enough, fair enough. Central bank digital currencies as ERC 20 tokens.
00:40:57.650 - 00:41:03.780, Speaker C: With privacy built in. I'm pretty long, but the way it's going, I think it's going to be difficult.
00:41:05.270 - 00:41:22.070, Speaker D: I suspect there's a non zero chance they end up with something that's an ERC. Probably not like on main net, but I feel there's probably a 2020 5% chance they end up with some private forked version of something that runs an ERC 20 token.
00:41:26.090 - 00:41:32.280, Speaker E: Okay, we're in a bear market right now. Long, short.
00:41:36.450 - 00:42:23.460, Speaker D: Not to like, touch. One thing I can say, I suspect I have no idea if we hit all time highs or continue going lower. I think I'm confident Ethereum doesn't go away. Even if we crashed 80 90%, which is something that I think I'd say now I'm like 80 90% confident about this. In the last bear market, I was like probably 50 50. And in the one after the Dow, I would say I thought Ethereum probably had like a 25% to 50% chance of survival at best. So I think even if we are in one, the ODs of this just going to zero and we all have to wrap up and go home and find something else to work on.
00:42:23.460 - 00:42:26.418, Speaker D: I feel like that's almost impossible at this point.
00:42:26.504 - 00:42:28.050, Speaker E: The merge by December.
00:42:31.830 - 00:42:33.202, Speaker D: These are all the spicy questions.
00:42:33.256 - 00:42:34.020, Speaker E: Long, short.
00:42:35.590 - 00:42:37.846, Speaker C: I know what the team says.
00:42:38.028 - 00:43:16.580, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm very neutral. I don't see a reason to have it in December if it's not safe to do so. Maybe there's a world where everything goes right and there's no issues implementing it and we feel confident. And sure, I don't want to delay the merge any more than is necessary, but if we get to October and we feel we still have a bunch of testing to do, then I think we should obviously do that. We shouldn't try to hit an arbitrary deadline because this is like a several hundred billion dollar network that we're moving over. So we really have to get this right.
00:43:18.550 - 00:43:25.000, Speaker E: Okay, that's a fair point. Ethereum 3.0 before 2027.
00:43:28.330 - 00:43:40.986, Speaker C: We still have to define what 3.0 is. I think in the mind of some people, 3.0 is CBC, or at least quantum resistance by 2027, hopefully, yeah, I.
00:43:41.008 - 00:44:04.180, Speaker D: Think CBC is pretty cool. As a non protocol developer who doesn't have to implement it, I think conceptually it makes a lot of sense. I know that the people who have to write it and support it in production feel like it's probably much more complicated. But, yeah, conceptually, I really like it.
00:44:05.350 - 00:44:15.480, Speaker E: Aren't there some issues with CBC, though? All the nodes have to have a low amount of latency or else CBC breaks down.
00:44:16.010 - 00:44:38.460, Speaker D: So this is why I said I'm not a protocol developer. I think the part I like about it, the idea of hierarchical sharding and having kind of a higher level shard that's kind of setting the pace for the rest of the system. That conceptually seems like a nice thing to have, but I understand in practice it might be pretty hard.
00:44:38.990 - 00:44:54.690, Speaker C: CBC has an interesting property that nodes can kind of set their own thresholds for finality, like the kind of things that they accept. So you don't necessarily need to be low latency. You can degrade your own, let's say, guarantees for the protocol.
00:44:58.870 - 00:45:07.526, Speaker E: All right. And then the second to last one, wag me. We're all going to make it. Long. Short.
00:45:07.708 - 00:45:10.840, Speaker B: We already made it long.
00:45:11.610 - 00:45:14.280, Speaker C: I'm an optimist. We should all make it.
00:45:17.350 - 00:45:18.820, Speaker E: Tim. Long. Short.
00:45:19.510 - 00:45:20.260, Speaker D: Long.
00:45:21.590 - 00:45:32.040, Speaker E: Okay. All right. This last one might be a little bit of a contentious issue. Pineapple on pizza. Long. Short.
00:45:33.370 - 00:45:33.922, Speaker D: Margin.
00:45:33.986 - 00:45:34.694, Speaker E: Long.
00:45:34.892 - 00:45:35.880, Speaker B: Love it.
00:45:36.650 - 00:45:38.440, Speaker E: Oh, my goodness. My man.
00:45:39.770 - 00:45:42.440, Speaker C: Long veggie pizza, though.
00:45:44.570 - 00:45:45.382, Speaker B: Also long.
00:45:45.436 - 00:45:45.762, Speaker E: Matt.
00:45:45.826 - 00:45:46.760, Speaker B: Also long.
00:45:47.870 - 00:46:12.686, Speaker E: We have Ethereum. The future of Ethereum is bright. That question really sealed it for me. Yeah. All right. We do want to open up to audience questions. So if you're in the audience and you want to ask these questions, some of these questions, Tim Barnaby or Matt, please make a request and you can come up on the stage.
00:46:12.686 - 00:46:15.394, Speaker E: All right, Anella, you came first. You want to ask your question.
00:46:15.432 - 00:46:15.586, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:46:15.608 - 00:46:45.180, Speaker F: Hi, guys. Thanks for bringing me up. It's a question I often get from family and friends as well, who don't really know why Ethereum is cool. I'm essentially curious, and this might be hard to say, but in your mind, is there like a one main goal with where you think Ethereum is going? Or is it more of a question of kind of, you know, you're onto something big, but you can't see the full potential of it yet, so just keep building.
00:46:49.640 - 00:47:08.840, Speaker C: I think for me, the big thing that I hope Ethereum can solve is allow for much more strong and robust bottom up coordination. I think Ethereum and blockchains in general are really just coordination machines that allow very different participants to coordinate, collaborate, cooperate.
00:47:09.740 - 00:47:51.508, Speaker D: I feel similarly. So the way, I guess my mental picture for Ethereum is like we're building this digital nation, right? Or this digital state which has an economy on it and whatnot. And I think what we can bring to the world is kind of a sandbox or a testing environment for new ways to coordinate new economic models, see if they work. And along the way, there will be plenty that do not work. And potentially there's stuff that we can build on Ethereum that we can then export back to the rest of the world. And I think that'd be a huge net positive, the clearest candidate right now. We've seen the success of quadratic funding on gitcoin.
00:47:51.508 - 00:48:21.040, Speaker D: So to me that's just like a really clear example of there was this economic theory that existed that's kind of weird. No real world institution will try it out. And we've had, I'd say, at least moderate success with it on Ethereum. And then we can kind of use those as case studies and say like, hey, look, this thing works. It works better than these other systems. Here's why. So, yeah, I think if there can be many more of those, yeah, that's super valuable.
00:48:22.660 - 00:48:24.288, Speaker F: Thank you. That makes sense.
00:48:24.374 - 00:48:24.960, Speaker C: Okay.
00:48:25.110 - 00:48:56.590, Speaker B: I think for me is just very similar to Barnaby and Tim, but I think Ethereum is bringing a new primitive to the world that was really never possible before and being able to collaborate with people and make decisions and have contracts be executed trustlessly and without bias. These are things that had never been possible before in humanity. And now we have this computer that can do it for us.
00:48:57.200 - 00:49:01.580, Speaker E: All right, Pranay, you're next up as a speaker.
00:49:02.240 - 00:49:13.170, Speaker G: Oh, hi. Thank you for the opportunity. I'd like to ask if, do you guys see Ethereum being a global currency by 2025?
00:49:15.860 - 00:49:17.270, Speaker D: It already is.
00:49:20.520 - 00:49:22.150, Speaker E: Yeah, we already made it.
00:49:22.840 - 00:49:24.310, Speaker C: Is it money, though?
00:49:26.200 - 00:49:30.550, Speaker D: I mean, it has an exchange rate. Yeah.
00:49:35.180 - 00:49:46.204, Speaker E: I think it is currency. All right, defi ant defiant. Yes. You are next.
00:49:46.402 - 00:50:12.564, Speaker H: Okay, thanks for giving me this opportunity. My question goes to the devs. I'm a developer, but from where I come we just use simple technologies like PHP. I'm here in Kenya, so I was asking Tim and the rest, which track do you guys use? And if you guys use solidity, what is so special with it?
00:50:12.762 - 00:50:42.750, Speaker B: So for core development, it's in basically every language that you can imagine. We've got the go Ethereum client, open Ethereum and rust, nether bind and C sharp, a JavaScript client. There's lots of different ways to be involved and then there's tooling written for all these different languages. And so pretty much no matter what your background is, there are clients that you can read and understand and hopefully help contribute to.
00:50:43.120 - 00:50:59.452, Speaker E: I think you had that last question about why solidity? Mind providing some details, Tim, sorry you broke up there. Yeah. I think the other part of his question was why use solidity in particular, what makes it so special?
00:50:59.526 - 00:51:09.590, Speaker D: I mean, it's the number one programming language for smart contracts and there's just a ton of tooling and documentation around it. So it's probably just the most accessible one.
00:51:11.020 - 00:51:13.370, Speaker B: It's also probably the most secure one.
00:51:14.380 - 00:51:15.130, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:51:15.740 - 00:51:19.400, Speaker H: So are you guys long or short on solidity?
00:51:20.780 - 00:51:21.656, Speaker B: Very long.
00:51:21.758 - 00:51:50.708, Speaker D: Pretty long, yeah, long. And I mean, we are seeing, though, I think solidity is definitely the number one entry point. But then you see, I think people who get extremely comfortable writing in the EVM sometimes, like literally writing in assembly for the EVM, but I don't think you get there without an extremely solid understanding of solidity and how that works. Before going even deeper, I think a.
00:51:50.714 - 00:51:55.408, Speaker E: Lot of the flashbot stuff, they're writing directly into EVM because it's a lot more gas.
00:51:55.504 - 00:52:32.896, Speaker D: Yeah, some of that I remember also a couple of years ago, I don't think they were ICOs, but the things where you could lock your ETH and get your ETH back after a while for a signaling thing, those were pretty simple to write, and they were written in assembly because they were scared of potentially introducing a bug by using solidity. So if you have a very simple use case and you want to be absolutely sure of what actually happens in the EVM, that's a really good use.
00:52:32.918 - 00:52:33.970, Speaker B: Case for it, too.
00:52:35.380 - 00:52:40.132, Speaker E: I have a question. Sure, go ahead.
00:52:40.186 - 00:53:06.030, Speaker G: Yeah. So there was this one time where I transferred money by mistake into a go chain. So it was for a go token, and there was no way to get the token back because they said it is not built on the Ethereum chain. So for things like these instances, is there any way to get the money back and then get by Ethereum after that?
00:53:08.400 - 00:53:26.290, Speaker D: Usually no, it depends on the circumstances. But if you transfer it to a wrong address, the ODs are, you've sent it to some address which the private key for is not known. And if that's the case, then there's just no way to get those funds back.
00:53:27.540 - 00:53:30.390, Speaker G: Is this something that would be addressed in the future?
00:53:31.000 - 00:53:57.124, Speaker D: I don't think so. And the reason why is. I guess there's two reasons why. One is it's very hard to kind of differentiate at the protocol level that versus stealing funds from someone. Right. We can't know, looking at the protocol, whether this random address that's only received one transfer is actually a mistake or you're sending it to somebody's new address. Right.
00:53:57.124 - 00:54:26.550, Speaker D: There's no objective way to prove that. And then the other challenge is there are some use cases where people actually burn funds, so they want those funds to be destroyed. And that's also something where at the protocol level, it's hard to make a difference between the funds that got burnt by accident and the funds that got burnt on purpose. So just because there's so much ambiguity there, historically, there's no good way to go about it.
00:54:29.660 - 00:54:30.650, Speaker G: Thank you.
00:54:31.100 - 00:54:37.210, Speaker E: All right, Drew, we'll have that last question since we are at the 07:00 p.m.. Mark.
00:54:38.300 - 00:54:58.640, Speaker B: So as roll ups continue to become more and more common, what do the people think that over the next one, two, and five years, what percentage of block space on main net will be used by roll ups and other verifier contracts compared to real application logic?
00:54:58.980 - 00:55:27.800, Speaker C: Well, hopefully in, I guess, the two to five years frame roll ups actually have their own dedicated data shards, so they don't necessarily need to do much on the execution chain. On that chain, you might find things like locking your deposit for the beacon chain or sending your deposits on the roll up contracts themselves. I guess in the short term, you should expect the roll up share of blocks to increase, in my opinion.
00:55:30.830 - 00:55:47.140, Speaker E: Okay, great. We do just have one question to cap it off. At the end of this discussion, can you give us some of us, like, some hints on when the next Devcon and when and where the next Devcon will take place?
00:55:48.950 - 00:55:49.700, Speaker D: No.
00:55:54.870 - 00:55:57.006, Speaker C: Did something change? It's not Bogota.
00:55:57.118 - 00:56:13.560, Speaker D: I think Bogota is probably the likeliest place the Defcon team is. Yeah, I think they've mentioned publicly, like, they're still waiting to see how the situation evolves there. But, yeah, there's a lot of uncertainty, so we don't know.
00:56:15.610 - 00:56:30.522, Speaker E: All right. Looking forward to maybe something doing something like this for DeFCon as well. But in any case, it was really solid discussion. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Barnaby. Thank you, Matt, for all showing up. This is really solid.
00:56:30.522 - 00:56:40.702, Speaker E: And, yeah, enjoy your evenings, and especially you, Matt, in Paris. And thank you for showing up. It was really solid. And we all appreciate you guys coming here.
00:56:40.756 - 00:56:41.630, Speaker A: Thank you, guys.
00:56:41.780 - 00:56:42.782, Speaker D: Thanks for having us.
00:56:42.836 - 00:56:43.422, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
00:56:43.476 - 00:56:44.046, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:56:44.148 - 00:56:44.830, Speaker B: Cheers.
00:56:45.570 - 00:56:46.218, Speaker C: All right, bye.
