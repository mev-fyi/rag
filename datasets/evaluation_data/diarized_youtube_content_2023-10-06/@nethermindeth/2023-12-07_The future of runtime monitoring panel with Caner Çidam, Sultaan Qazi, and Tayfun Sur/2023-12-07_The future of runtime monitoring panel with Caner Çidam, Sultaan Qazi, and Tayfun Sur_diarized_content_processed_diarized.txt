00:00:01.210 - 00:00:01.374, Speaker A: Cool.
00:00:01.412 - 00:00:22.880, Speaker B: This discussion is about the future of runtime monitoring a few providers. One, I'm not a runtime expert. It's actually Tayson here who's from Nethermins working with us with Porta. And then we have real experts on the tunnel. We have Sultan working in Cybersec. And.
00:00:24.890 - 00:00:25.254, Speaker A: There.
00:00:25.292 - 00:00:28.262, Speaker B: Yeah, I said it was wrong in the hallway, so I wanted to make sure I was doing it right.
00:00:28.316 - 00:00:28.966, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:29.148 - 00:01:14.366, Speaker B: From fort the network, I think we're going to take the discussion through some of the more modern techniques that are available to runtime monitoring. And I also want to take it into directions about how do you do active responses to threats that you identify and so on. I know that this is still being worked on a lot and there's a lot of space here. So to start off with, I'm going to hand the mic over, and if you can give yourselves a quick introduction with more detail than I've provided, and maybe go into what you think some of the biggest challenges are in the space of runtime monitoring, specifically from your own perspective in the ecosystem, and also what you see others struggling, other solutions.
00:01:14.398 - 00:01:18.098, Speaker A: That you think are interesting. Perfect.
00:01:18.184 - 00:01:55.266, Speaker C: Thank you. So my name is Sultan Khazi, or I go by salty, because in Canada, no one can actually pronounce my name properly. I run all the partnerships and pretty much anything client facing for cybers. We're a real time monitoring and threat detection platform for web three security. In terms of going back to what you were saying, I think that one of the biggest issues that we're seeing is kind of, for lack of a better term, is tunnel vision. So Jenna and I were on a panel yesterday together, and one of our other panelists said that security needs to be respected. And in Web three, that's not the case right now.
00:01:55.266 - 00:02:22.950, Speaker C: And I think that it's pretty clear, because if you look at the current landscape, a, there's very few organizations that are using real time monitoring to begin with. A lot of times, unfortunately, and I've talked to, we partner with tons and tons of different auditors, a lot of them will say, like, this looks bad when they get exploited. But we gave them three recommendations. They fixed absolutely none of them because it was either expensive or it pushed back the launch date. And so I think that that's a pretty good example.
00:02:23.020 - 00:02:23.206, Speaker A: Right?
00:02:23.228 - 00:03:04.694, Speaker C: They're usually picking one or the other. And the reality is that security shouldn't be an afterthought. It should be almost designed by high security. So I think that the biggest issue I see is, like fragmentation, where people are having to choose between an audit or real time, or about bug bounty, whatever it may be. And in their defense, I understand that market conditions are pretty tough and these things aren't cheap. So I do empathize with that. But then you look at circumstances like, one example that I always point to is, like, the oiler attack, right? When $200 million lost, they had no runtime monitoring, and using a system like ours, we wouldn't have been able to mitigate everything, but they would have lost 7.9
00:03:04.694 - 00:03:05.862, Speaker C: million instead of 200.
00:03:05.916 - 00:03:06.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:03:06.172 - 00:03:29.680, Speaker C: So that's still a big loss. But obviously, when you look at the scale of what it ended up being, it's very different. So I think that even again on the other panel, there is some focus on what's the future of security and all these things. And I kind of always go back to say, like, we haven't solved the problems of yesterday, let alone problems with tomorrow. So, to me, that's kind of where I think we should start.
00:03:31.650 - 00:04:01.734, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. My name is Jonah. I'm a part of open Zeppelin, but I mainly work on Forta. I develop the Forta network. I mainly work on the node network that run the detection bots. We're doing community based threat detection. So it's a permissionless network, which anyone can write a security bot and deploy there and produce alerts and labels and findings and somehow consume these alerts as well.
00:04:01.734 - 00:04:54.970, Speaker D: You have building blocks. There's an SDK that allows you to build a bot right away and to deploy it as well. Well, we have an app adapt, actually assist you with that. And there are also already deployed bots which you can consume the alerts of, so you can write bots that feed other bots with the alerts. And these are also fedora data sources, and they try to create variety of insights about things that are going on chain. So right now, we have a lot of bots that are written and maintained by different community members. Some of them are typhoon, and also Vasilis, he's over there, and they are currently developing some of these bots right now in forte.
00:04:54.970 - 00:05:57.870, Speaker D: So one of our challenges there is, I think, mainly how so you can produce this threat intel for anyone to use. It has complex insights about what's happening. There are different kind of bots that maybe they point to money laundering stuff or spams that are going on, or scams that are going on, and tens of, or maybe hundred bots. I don't remember the exact count right now, but the final goal is doing something with this. And right now, we have this notification flow feature that allows you to call webhook or maybe consume from the API and do something with that. But then what do you do with it so you can pause your contract and do something else? We're trying to delve deeper into how we can better apply these alerts as solutions and try to find new ways to. So I hope to be explaining more about that later in the questions.
00:05:57.940 - 00:05:59.920, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you.
00:06:00.290 - 00:06:04.718, Speaker E: Hey everyone, I'm Typhoon from Porta, I'm sorry, from Nethermind.
00:06:04.734 - 00:06:04.914, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:04.952 - 00:07:10.310, Speaker E: I've mainly been doing Porta tests since the day I joined Nethermind. So I'm actually part of mean what we do is actually developing the detection bots. But when I first started, we started with protocol based detection bots. It wasn't always like the attack types, and sometimes they would be more like information related alerts. But recently we continue mainly with the general type of attack bots that can catch everything, I mean any general attack going on the network. So it's really an exciting field to be in, actually. So the most critical challenges that I see in the field is that it revolves around basically the evolving nature of thread types actually, and the nature of decentralization of blockchain.
00:07:10.310 - 00:08:11.014, Speaker E: So we have this smart contract vulnerability, even though despite the detailed analysis and audits, we still have vulnerabilities happening every day. And it's because of everything is changing constantly and evolving to something new. And everybody is like testing your code, like whole world is testing your code, because it's all open code, so everybody sees it, everybody actually tries to break it, it's even worse. So that's why there is always new attack vulnerability found, type found every day. And that's one thing and another problem is scalability. So as blockchain applications grow every day, monitoring for each transaction for anomalies becomes increasingly complex. And it's not just due to the number of users in the system, but it's also number of deployed contracts every minute.
00:08:11.014 - 00:08:54.418, Speaker E: So we cannot generalize the attacks because there are many different contracts and there are many different attack types, we cannot define them into a certain context. And lastly, the decentralized nature of blockchain makes things even a little bit harder because maybe we can talk about it later. But what I mean by that is it's hard to respond exactly in that bumble because we need consensus to give some response. So unlike centralized system, it's one of the hardships I'd say, that I see in the network.
00:08:54.514 - 00:08:55.160, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:58.110 - 00:09:29.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll move closer in a bit. Thank you all. I actually kind of want to combine some of your answers here into the next question. So you brought up the fact that many protocols are making trade offs between security beforehand or afterhand, by doing audits or by doing runtime verification and runtime monitoring. You're saying it's decentralized. And there are so many different types of attacks that come out that it's actually hard to classify them all. So I think this is part where your community based approach comes from.
00:09:29.794 - 00:09:48.950, Speaker B: Like, anyone can try to identify their own things, but I'm going to switch it over to cybers here and say you guys are working on AI solutions here for the monitor. How does that help in the context of this ever evolving attack vector, and where does it kind of fall short and where can you improve?
00:09:50.910 - 00:10:26.782, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think that, simply put, the benefit of using AI is that as opposed to a rule set or heuristics based model, you're just going to have naturally less false positives. It's going to slowly get better and better. That's machine learning. That's the benefit of it. And I think that we've seen that even just in our detection rates and our false positive rates kind of steadily declining. I've only been at the organization for about eight months, and since then to now, the detection rates just continually improve. And I think that to me, that's kind of the main benefit.
00:10:26.846 - 00:10:28.066, Speaker E: The best example I can give you.
00:10:28.088 - 00:10:45.594, Speaker C: Of that is an example where a rule, arbitrary, don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place, and I think there's a lot of value in arbitrary rules and heuristics. But one example that I can give you in recent memory that we detected was stake.com. So when Steak.com got exploited, our system.
00:10:45.632 - 00:10:46.554, Speaker D: Picked up on it right away.
00:10:46.592 - 00:11:02.250, Speaker C: I think we were first to market in terms of alerting them. And the thing that was most impressive to me about this detection itself was that we didn't detect the first detection or that triggered kind of our system was a transfer for one ETH.
00:11:02.330 - 00:11:02.574, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:02.612 - 00:11:28.166, Speaker C: So if you think about stake.com, like, I'm canadian, so I'm more familiar with Drake than I'm willing to admit, but he's betting million dollar bets on Raptors games. So obviously you're talking about a pretty large amount of transaction volume and then also the size. So a one e transfer triggering our system, to me, is like a testament to AI being kind of the backbone of it. And so in an example like that, if you're able to, detection is always.
00:11:28.188 - 00:11:29.266, Speaker E: One piece of the puzzle.
00:11:29.298 - 00:12:09.294, Speaker C: The other side is kind of the response side. And so they didn't have a system in place for detection nor response. But in a case like that, I think that's where you're really going to see the benefits of AI kind of shine through. Obviously, the negative side of it is that the models themselves, yeah, while they improve, it's also based off of more or less a private data set. So we're always looking at ways to kind of increase that and increase the exposure. And if there is any exploits that our system doesn't pick up, then we kind of feed that through on the back end to get the system to learn it. But this is actually why I think that the future of the landscape is not going to be one big provider.
00:12:09.294 - 00:12:39.680, Speaker C: Right. You kind of have market dominance in the compliance space, and that's kind of where I come from for Mastercard with chainalysis, where yeah, TRM and elliptic are top tier products, but the reality is market dominance for chain analysis is massive. I don't think you're going to see quite the same thing in real time monitoring, just a partially because a lot of it is focused on Defi. But then the other thing is that there's going to be a real benefit to a protocol for leveraging a cyberse and a Ford simultaneously. Right. As well as some other things. But to me that's kind of where things really shine through.
00:12:40.850 - 00:12:49.278, Speaker B: Would you like to add some comments on how the community helps on this front, or if there's. Are there any plans for AI in the forte systems?
00:12:49.454 - 00:13:38.014, Speaker D: Yes, there is AI and forte. So maybe I could add. So I actually agree with what sultan said. So it's hard to find one winner in these security solutions. So I'll explain one phenomenon before I talk about the AI and community part of it. It's like there's this one detection bot that is checking multiple things, and then for redundancy, what we do in the network is we run this bot on three different nodes, so that if one of the nodes have a problem, then the other two nodes actually produce some outputs at least. But then what you see is when the bot becomes more complicated, you see that one of these bots are not firing and other two is firing.
00:13:38.014 - 00:14:27.662, Speaker D: Sometimes only one of them are firing because of the external state dependency of how things are changing in real time, et cetera, let alone running the same. Detection in real time also gives like different results. We were using ML models in the bots to find out about scams and attacks going on. And I think typing might be able to say maybe more about this, because he's doing. What I know is what we try to do here is these ML models. They find different things, look at different aspects from different angles, and they say different things. And these are built by different people for different purposes.
00:14:27.662 - 00:14:55.100, Speaker D: So when you get this collectively, have this knowledge of things happening, then you have a higher coverage about things happening on all of the chains. And this data could be from cybers, it could be from another provider, or it could be a custom bar written on Forta. Combining these, then you're able to produce really high quality outputs that have higher precision. So in that respect, that's really.
00:15:00.250 - 00:15:58.614, Speaker E: Personally, we haven't implemented AI into our bots yet, but we have worked with machine learning bots, so I want to add something onto that. So, machine learning, the beautiful thing about it is that it can learn and it can be trained, so it can use the past data to analyze vast amount of data and figure out what's wrong. I mean, try to try to bring some shapes of the attacks. I mean, try to find some indicators of an early attack. So let's say we want to figure out unusual activity. So what is unusual? It's subjective, right? So you cannot calculate it. But with the machine learning bot, when you train it, it goes to that protocol and do its analysis to figure out what's unusual for that protocol.
00:15:58.614 - 00:16:16.670, Speaker E: And then it turns to something measurable. So let's say it monitors a bridge, and when an unusual amount of transfer happens, it direct the alerts. So it's something that we use a lot for the Netherland.
00:16:19.090 - 00:16:20.080, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:16:22.290 - 00:16:25.522, Speaker B: Do we have minutes left or five or ten minutes left?
00:16:25.576 - 00:16:26.642, Speaker A: Ten minutes. Ten minutes left.
00:16:26.696 - 00:16:27.346, Speaker E: Okay, cool.
00:16:27.448 - 00:16:48.170, Speaker B: Let's get to some more spicy questions, I think make things a bit more exciting for everybody. I'll also need some education on this front, but there are a series of runtime monitoring solutions that are looking at analyzing mempool and then making sure that a transaction which seems suspicious is either front run or blocked or something.
00:16:48.240 - 00:16:48.570, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:48.640 - 00:17:03.598, Speaker B: You could either do it to a searcher, try to execute the transaction, and take the money yourself to then refund whoever exploited it, or you could pause the protocol right now. Am I right that pausing a protocol leads to some dicey regulatory issues?
00:17:03.684 - 00:17:03.982, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:04.036 - 00:17:18.690, Speaker B: Depending on who, what, and where? Can you explain some of the difficulties around here and whether or not that's something that you can do in a centralized system or by a decentralized system, or if that makes a difference to your ability to pause a protocol?
00:17:21.990 - 00:17:25.946, Speaker C: I can't speak so much to the like. I do come from the regulatory side, from Mastercress.
00:17:25.998 - 00:17:27.142, Speaker E: I probably should be able to.
00:17:27.196 - 00:18:37.402, Speaker C: But I think that ultimately the area that I see this kind of, I guess forward looking, where this becomes more of an issue is you're obviously seeing institutional players coming into the space, right. Obviously that everyone knows about the ETFs. I think that in short order there will be following the ETFs, there will be liquid staking or staking of some sort that will be offered by those same entities. Now, the tricky part about that is that when you look at, let's say, fidelity or a blackrock that wants to come in and now offer that to their institutional clients, there's a couple of things at play. Number one is that their risk tolerance is going to be sub zero, essentially, right? So in an environment like that, where it's supposed to be primarily decentralized, pausing the contract, even if you go and you pause the contract, it's not a false positive and you save the funds and everything. The reality is that if you think of the transaction volume and the types of clientele that they'll be working with, continuity is arguably just as important as the security, right. So I think that you're going to see an evolution a little bit in terms of, as with everything in Web three, there's going to be a trade off, right, where there are offerings in market.
00:18:37.402 - 00:19:18.666, Speaker C: We even looked at this as well, where you're able to kind of build in almost a contract modifier, if you will, that sits on top, that is able to block transactions without actually pausing the contract. So almost kind of thinking of a middle ground of pausing versus just letting it go through. So I think that what will happen, and this is, again, unsurprising, is that you're going to have different organizations that have different criteria for what they're looking for. So you will find protocols that are going to be like, no, we want Forda because it's the most decentralized, because it's community driven, XYZ. And then you're going to have people on the other side of the spectrum that are going to know we can't afford to have that. We're not willing to take the risk. We want this to be.
00:19:18.688 - 00:19:18.874, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:18.912 - 00:19:23.302, Speaker C: Are we sacrificing decentralization for the sake of security and continuity?
00:19:23.366 - 00:19:23.594, Speaker A: Yes.
00:19:23.632 - 00:19:33.200, Speaker C: So I think that that will all be very interesting as to how that plays out. And I guess from the regulatory side, I probably should have prepped more about exactly what's happening on that front.
00:19:36.850 - 00:20:19.280, Speaker D: So one difficulty I'm thinking about when we're seeing decentralization and stopping these attacks is when you want to do it. You're actually doing some bit of censorship, maybe because you're stopping someone, but according to what and why. So that needs to be justified. Well, and applying these principles in practice is difficult. We have bots that tell a lot of precise things. One of them has like 90% precision, even though it's using an ML model. But then there's this 10%.
00:20:19.280 - 00:20:31.450, Speaker D: The question is what happens and how much risk you're willing to take by applying this. Yeah.
00:20:35.360 - 00:21:34.816, Speaker E: When it comes to precision, this is up to teams and the attacks, actually. I mean, some teams can tolerate to not have these FPS or having these FPS frequently. So it should be a decision that comes with a consensus. But let's say we all love decentralization, but we don't like losing our funds. It's tricky because there's no certain answer to this question. But what I'm going to say is, if we are sure, that highly sure that it's a real attack, then there is no problem with locking the protocol. But you are asking, what if it's not just right, it's wrong.
00:21:34.816 - 00:22:25.250, Speaker E: But we need to check our data and we need to say, like, each alert in Porta and measurement right now has its anomaly score. So it says that. How frequent is that alert coming every day? So if it's not a frequent alert and if it comes back to back, it certainly means that there is something wrong with that. So we decide these decisions, I mean, choose these decisions by looking at these anomaly scores and precision and calculation. But these numbers can be set by the team. We can lower the threshold or increase the threshold according to what we do or what we want our clients to experience.
00:22:30.180 - 00:23:21.804, Speaker B: I would strongly agree with this. I'm not sure if a panelist is allowed to make an opinion here, but one of the things I'd be concerned of is whether or not you'd be held responsible for the protocol if you're the one who's capable of saying or dictating which transactions enter and which ones don't. And I think that'll be one of the really sticky areas for the next few years in runtime monitoring. But it is true that there's this incredibly difficult trade off that you're constantly making about whether or not your actions are censoring or they're actually meant good for the critical and a whole philosophical area where you say, yes, there's security that we expect, but in some sense, the blockchain is now like law. I say quote unquote. And if an action is taken in that set, then is that not correct behavior?
00:23:21.852 - 00:23:22.672, Speaker A: According to.
00:23:22.806 - 00:23:28.710, Speaker B: And we all know that humans make mistakes, but that's not the idea. But it's a strong point.
00:23:30.680 - 00:23:31.236, Speaker A: Cool.
00:23:31.338 - 00:24:14.912, Speaker B: I'm wondering, this trade off between. I've only got three minutes left, so I might just wrap it up rather than asking about nuances of whether or not you should be faster at identifying things or sloppier at like, lagging transactions. What technologies are you guys like the most excited for as a final node coming up? Like, either something that you're building yourself or something that you see elsewhere that is going to either directly bolster runtime monitoring capabilities or the responses of runtime monitoring. Or is there anything that's like an AI technique or is there a knowledge technique that might eliminate a class of bugs? Anything that you're kind of bullish about.
00:24:14.966 - 00:24:18.304, Speaker A: The next few years? Yeah.
00:24:18.342 - 00:25:26.872, Speaker C: So for me, I think the first thing that comes to mind is we have an update coming in about two weeks that will include something called reputational profiling. And so in many cases, security and compliance tend to blend their borders a little bit. And so one thing that we've noticed, and I'm sure everyone in the industry has seen this, but a lot of times in years previous, after an exploit, the criminal would go and kind of throw those funds through a couple of mixers and then essentially plant it or park it in some sort of unhosted wallet and kind of hope that people forget and people don't forget. So essentially what we're seeing as a much more common obfuscation technique now is that they'll actually take those funds, still throw it through mixers, but then they'll start to do multiple cross chain swaps, like over and over and over. And the reason that they're doing that is that the compliance providers, like genalysis, Trm, meliptic, et cetera, they're very good at what they do, but the reality is that their infrastructure wasn't designed to be able to kind of handle that. So what we've actually done is we've done a comparison against our tool and kind of seeing are we able to trace the risk cross chain. And so what happens is to kind of close this up is the criminals will kind of do that.
00:25:26.872 - 00:26:39.164, Speaker C: They'll go and then they'll usually use like a fake KyC account at Binance Coinbase, whatever one they want, off ramp, small batches of funds throughout. All of these take the funds out immediately, because when binance or any of those centralized exchanges go to do the API query with chainalysis. Let's say the funds come back clean and it's because of the fact that they've just ping ponged it so many times that it's not there. Then a week later all of a sudden those funds come back or the system updates. So with our system, just given that we've kind of designed it for this to be natively cross chain, whether the exploit happened 5 seconds ago or five days ago, you essentially will be able to use that in a similar way. So it's not so much on the security side of things. But I think that again, given how shoulder to shoulder compliance and security is, I think that in combination with hopefully more protocols and projects, kind of prioritizing, having an audit, a bug bounty, community driven, real time monitoring, all of it kind of holistically, I think that is what I'm looking forward to from a technology perspective, just kind of and seeing that integration where maybe cybersecurity are collaborating or you have even insurance, something that we've been exploring with insurance providers, like actually having us built into their platform or vice versa.
00:26:39.164 - 00:26:42.610, Speaker C: So I just think more cross collaboration. In short.
00:26:44.740 - 00:27:42.484, Speaker D: I kind of agree with these points. And this one thing I want to mention is something we discussed actually, Solan, yesterday in the morning we were having some conversations. And so if you want any runtime solutions right now, it's like what you can do is if you want to block malicious transactions, what you can do is you can choose your actors. And way to choose your actors is well you do KYC on them, but we don't want to do KYC on the people to let them be able to interact with all these DeFi protocols contracts, that would be ridiculous. And on the other side and on the other edge, what we see is like if you don't do anything, then you maybe accept the civil attacks or any kind of attack to happen to you. So you have like zero and one when you consider like that. And whereas the solution that anyone can offer right now is somewhere in the middle, it's just a gray area.
00:27:42.484 - 00:28:57.500, Speaker D: Threat detection is like a really gray thing because when you're detecting an attack, you can only say you have a level of confidence of something is happening, but you can't always exactly say something is happening. So similarly, how you want to apply to this on chain should maybe have a reflection of this idea, this property. So nobody's were thinking of something similar to that contract modifier change, but that is fed with a threat oracle that is on chain so these alerts that are produced from Fortnite Network are actually producing ideas about what kind of addresses these are. And so if you push this information on chain with some numbers that represent this gray area and change the contract to refuse its transactions, then maybe you can specify what level of confidence you want to have on all of these alerts and reject the transactions based on that. And this risk score is dynamic because it's produced in real time. So that's the solution we're kind of investigating nowadays and looking forward to delivering.
00:29:01.280 - 00:29:44.350, Speaker E: Okay, I'm looking. I'm mostly excited about actually two things. First is blockchain interoperability, because every day more blockchains interact with each other and this will bring the need to secure the transactions, cross transactions, actually. So runtime monitoring will be more important every day. And the second and most exciting thing maybe for me, is decentralized AI, which can work in distributed networks independently if it can evaluate the transactions and if it can even respond by itself without the needing to of authorization. I mean, that's the most exciting thing for me.
00:29:46.240 - 00:29:57.944, Speaker B: All right, well, you heard it here. Look out for reputation scores, look out for touch by the AI, and look out for community driven runtime monitoring. And thank you all for attending here and for speaking. Thank you, appreciate.
