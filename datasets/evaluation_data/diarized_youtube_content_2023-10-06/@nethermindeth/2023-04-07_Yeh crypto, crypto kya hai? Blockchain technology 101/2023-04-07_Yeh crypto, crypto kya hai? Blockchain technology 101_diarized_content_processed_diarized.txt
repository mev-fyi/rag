00:09:08.612 - 00:09:09.200, Speaker B: You.
00:09:15.770 - 00:14:40.430, Speaker C: So mary talk a title transitioning from web two and web to web three so before web three industry within Sal palani I was working as a full stack developer so stem front end mainly back end or Joe common problem that is kiagaram already front end may come karna backend may come karan web 3 may transition Karnagh learning curve web three industries exposure then talk may address karungagi transitioning itself with namushkil naya which points Hong kahape so con conceive different categories summary is talk kenda so let's move forward so Palatami sujan noga khan khan area then Japanese dono web two or web three intersect karthiya completely web three product ASR blockchain Vichali kabi kabi web three or web two k product cook XRP correlation especially job with cheese kycaraginido abapasata so concern area and joke dono definitely use ongo palato simple Ui front end developer all you have to do is apply for a job in a web three company and technically tomari initially onboarding start with jaguar to make basic exposure miljaga or since the web 3 may have come career though in general industry may get chalk idea the hiring front end developer or transition both easier. The front end can be in any language in any framework and coffee asan transition overall dusraga got the back end systems so blockchain right now since a bunch of nodes interact karao ten to relatively a poor network slow compared to joki central system of the exist karth this was just a user experience go improve connection Joki decentralized apps there vobi Sarah backend systems directihe taki user experience at chasaki or your actual information is a sensor neonie chase so blockchain major tabs manana jaga number one ruler key blockchain may minimum data ako joki absolutely needed a censorship resistance et cetera key need a scope back end design karthiyoto to bahapitum transition gasaktovni jobco or web three space like in first case the may exposure minerala gega yafitum like database forgetta give me need ot back end graphs forget extensive use OTA when it comes to querying the blockchain to Kaisari just say block explorer Ogato it is nothing but a highly scaled up database system Joki blockchain data co query garquet faster speed pay to miss of karthi so botsari opportunities back end collegiate now third one is cryptography and security so algorithm like anybody in security joki coffee deep down and no skill egg B device Archkala Sanijo cryptography use Nakarao data k transition egg Wifi system that may cryptography use basics of cryptography experience cryptography research Masakti blockchain especially Joki coffee extensive field protocol engineering may contribute Kasakto just method military blockchain key notes Cassie calculation OGI Cassie Infrastructure manager or also you can help in things like security so cryptography basic knowledge honor Yafitumaga security exposure web 2 may security auditing relatively Joe move karnaka timeline so that is the third point where you can enter. Fourth is DevOps so very important because blocked just a normal system method Mehr system go scale up Kanapata performance AI delays Naho Sarah B latencies machines that jog dosage interact machines monitor Kanai for example agartom let's say Tome company or your beast validator manage Karthi let's say Ethereum Kotagi no troubleshooting mechanism and execute kana to subki monitoring to kaisare companies terraform combination use Karthe or kafisara load balancing existing DevOps scaling Kali monitoring Kala Saria chai blockchain level pero Raksar, Otagi, Dapps Oti and Jinka back end system DevOps.
00:14:42.950 - 00:14:46.802, Speaker B: Easy transition so front end quality.
00:14:46.856 - 00:16:47.990, Speaker C: Cover Kalia to mari existing front end Giga skills OtO mobile developer web developer tomorrow transition Kana Asani application Kochan Nikola user contract JavaScript scripts nay lakega blockchains and track and nikola logo so you always have an option to transition from in the industry same case back end Jesse Bola Bohad's other databases use OTA back end APIs reliability Bahad important OTA or put a graphk system so the graph career protocol system query Karthi blockchain code starting blocks and bought extensively used kiajata industry system design Karna Orbi analytic platform say both are a black and imagine securityb as mentioned cryptography Herchiski foundation so from basic cryptography protocol level say to smart contract make big cryptography users example here tornado cashmere zero knowledge proof use Kirk tomorrow protocol design Kia gata both are the use cases Dapps maybe hotehan both opportunities and security engineers Karibi Hape DevOps engineer again infrastructure can manage kanota or yek basic market trend 2022 rate pay number of developers transition who are the actively contribute karate going from zero to 18,000 in a matter of ten years and you have to keep in mind key industry recognition with those are pandraga Maya opportunities is the bunny bitcoin, bitcoin or eggdo coins or to the pandrazi transition space Abhibi kitani naya.
00:16:48.650 - 00:16:53.830, Speaker B: Clearly the Karai okay.
00:16:56.920 - 00:17:04.380, Speaker C: Iskalawa may I point or mention kanachanga kiyejo pura market scale mainly ayata kyoki.
00:17:06.160 - 00:17:07.292, Speaker B: Those are eight.
00:17:07.346 - 00:18:48.040, Speaker C: Major financial crisis market mayata to us point pay realize central log operate nakar decentralized system corruption rate of per se or normal logo passageway waste now so us for just say initially bitcoin recognition mediti but use cases what limited ethereum smart contract those are pandra kevadi exponential rise or yay basically d five bloomer d five bloom is basically bought sarah projects basically a protocol just method lonely sakto just say the normal market restrictions over collateralization or Saiyata compound joke similar taximation projections like Kitanadama Yield Malayga Botsala Special protocol Amm pools Binance trades for Theo manage hotel Single and central entity basically Amm pools Basic architecture expand those are Java institutions trading or finance background or expansion projector ribbon finance joke options trading or et cetera Perpetual protocol dy Dx Yes Advanced level financial product vanilla.
00:18:48.120 - 00:18:52.796, Speaker B: On chain he chalted so need care.
00:18:52.978 - 00:19:52.290, Speaker C: D five transparency tomorrow both recent example iska Adani enterprises oga just bna billions of investment agar kiri dollarski most of the people as a deposit rakawata as bmhata so yahasse better transparency opportunities or different let's say donation Kario contribute kanachatoki Ethereum or sari blockchain addresses pseudo anonymous anonymous so tom patalaga there was transparency ultimate needy takim those are art just a cris avoid karapai so we jabbiki power me so that was the whole idea and that was from my end.
00:19:53.380 - 00:19:55.664, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you.
00:19:55.702 - 00:20:18.164, Speaker A: Rachit and coffee insightful talk killer a question upset artificial intelligence fields chat GPT or coffee interest Hamlog field Medicraid developer Hair quick individuala Joe Artificial intelligence kf field may have move kirk bitcoin blockchain.
00:20:18.212 - 00:20:23.652, Speaker B: Kfield may asakta okay so artificial intelligence.
00:20:23.716 - 00:21:17.160, Speaker C: Tholis for example Abi Kaisare project say Joki Koshish karangi casse AI quick decentralized network may convert AI key calculation could decentralize cursor jokabik research field clear solution nimila but especially but Jolog just a data analyst site Khan transition easy yoga cookie again Explorer Vagara K or blockchain key monitoring vague contribute kasakna hardcore machine learning or AI incai use case more like type of tools may have joke help karthi Apco like predict karnakhalier in trading et cetera to algorithmics bots for garami otherwise baki sapto AI kitons limited.
00:21:17.240 - 00:21:20.156, Speaker B: In my opinion though so it will.
00:21:20.178 - 00:21:30.156, Speaker C: Be a relatively more learning curve for someone in artificial intelligence. But I don't think it will be too long. Yogi just scale pay growth Fourier I.
00:21:30.178 - 00:21:30.750, Speaker B: Think.
00:21:32.720 - 00:22:12.430, Speaker C: Artificial intelligence key calculations or processing code Kisita industry direction Majaga AI involvement naipata AI kudmi involved integrate kana is a bit of an ambiguous question.
00:22:15.060 - 00:22:16.352, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the answer.
00:22:16.406 - 00:22:17.200, Speaker B: Rachit.
00:22:19.460 - 00:22:41.320, Speaker A: Next talk perjangay joe maximjeet Jaspe bhatkarangay though blockchain k space may consensus mechanism jongo volta vocafi important or osma say ache consensus mechanism have proof of stake or ispari maximjeet apko pure information apkopura dengue so maximjeet the floor is yours.
00:22:45.730 - 00:23:42.630, Speaker D: Can you see my screen? I hope that you can. So hi again guys I'm maximjeet. Many introductions starting but just as a reminder I am currently working as a data engineer at one of the Nethermas project which is twinship. So what is basically state that's what my talk is all going to be about. So jump blockchains kibatkati whenever we say key this is the state of a blockchain. What it means is key a consensus risk. What does consensus mean? Consensus mean consensus complicated subword lakhta meaning directly but uska lake agar both the other simplify garna and if you have to explain it in one word I would call it simply an agreement.
00:23:42.630 - 00:24:39.698, Speaker D: It is key multiple parties Johan they have agreed key this is a fact. Could be hospital in case of blockchains. So it means key Jesse agarham bitcoin nailing it. The basic rule of state is balance of a person. Agarap Ethereum ledge amp smart contracts possible here the wahmp basic logic of meaning of a state is e what is the value of some storage at some specific location of a smart contract? So in order to reach consensus, what nodes do is they communicate. And there are different algorithms that they use to agree on a certain state. Most of the people that got introduced to crypto, they must have heard of bitcoin as the first point of transition into crypto and blockchain space.
00:24:39.698 - 00:25:21.482, Speaker D: So crypto kai use kartha proof of work bitcoin. Those are nowhere. Basically the creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakomoto. What he did was he mined the first block of bitcoin and he did include Usme a sentence. The sentence was the headline of the paper on three Jan 2009 chancellor on brink of second bailout of bank. This was during the after the financial cris of Doja art and there are multiple versions. Why exactly did you include this headline and why not? But there was general, again, consensus risk.
00:25:21.482 - 00:26:02.074, Speaker D: It was to prove key ustephala block mine is Stephen hi, karata. So after bitcoin came into existence, people started mining bitcoin. What mining bitcoin means is Kitum computer based software run Karthi Joki complex mathematical problem solve. Karthi in case of bitcoin, it is basically on a very simple level. It's a simple hashing function to log Barbara repeat Kirk try karthi to get an output of a certain format and iscobal they're mining. However, the way this works is there are a lot of computers all over the world. They start mining and they basically start solving this problem.
00:26:02.074 - 00:26:10.010, Speaker D: Whoever solves the problem first, he receives a certain reward. Who reward hotel bitcoin in case of bitcoin as a blockchain.
00:26:10.090 - 00:26:10.720, Speaker C: So.
00:26:27.670 - 00:26:28.846, Speaker D: It is kind of a waste.
00:26:28.878 - 00:26:30.818, Speaker B: Of their energy, though.
00:26:30.904 - 00:26:59.998, Speaker D: Agarham is points of the ekhajai, let's say if there was a way taki kali egg bandeko Bhagna bade race or it's not necessarily a sprint, it can be a marathon. He doesn't have to solve it. He hasn't to do anything as fast as possible. But the point is he would know. Kimerico Agla Bhagnai. That is how proof of stake works. What proof of stake does is it has a certain schedule and everyone knows when do they have to mine a.
00:27:00.004 - 00:27:00.670, Speaker B: Block.
00:27:02.690 - 00:27:29.240, Speaker D: In order to like in proof of stake a set of validators out there. These set of validators are the ones that have to achieve consensus on the state of a state. On the state of a blockchain. Taki up validator set apart one pow. You have to basically stake your coins. What staker coins means is monetary value. Astro stake Java control.
00:27:29.240 - 00:28:14.710, Speaker D: And this amount of money is in the control of the network, which has the power. Slash means kivovala pasako saying delay. So iska kalogica why would I want to slash my coins agar yaf or slash my value? There is no logical reason why I would do that. However, the reason is you get rewards. So what proof of stake does is take Karthihan after eight validator banth. The validator on the network receives a certain amount of rewards for every single action he does like. Let's say Kia block suggest Kia Usnavovali rate block suggest certain reward.
00:28:14.710 - 00:29:19.050, Speaker D: This reward is basically what incentivizes the validator to be active on the network. Validators Johan schedule Jote randomly generate and schedule me patho every validator knows block maniproduce Karna block produce Kirk Blockura Network Kakama Ulkagame if the block produced is valid or not. Now what valid means is Kyoskovi malicious transactions. Nyongi yakir usme transaction kojodala actually a transaction asne which is signed by a private key. Putting that thing aside, the point is you are earning rewards for your stake. And that is the whole concept of that's why it's called proof of stake. As I said, when people realized running in that race is kind of useless for all the others except for the first person, this had a very direct relation to basically saving energy.
00:29:19.050 - 00:29:49.270, Speaker D: So bitcoin key mining Houthi there used to be these huge mining farms. Just keep photography. Last slide. For example, this is a large mining farm in Russia, and they used to waste a lot of computational energy on trying to solve these mathematical problems. Proof of stake is co eliminate karate. For example, last year, end of last year ethereum commercial what merge was key were proof of work. Say proof of stake may transfer water.
00:29:49.270 - 00:31:13.902, Speaker D: And this was the first blockchain to ever do that transition, at least first major blockchain that is commonly known among people. Now, when I say key rewards hotel, these rewards are given to the validator in multiple ways. Egg those are the inflation rewards, inflation rewards. These rewards are determined by the protocol itself. They say let's say that Agar apka validator 90% of the time online Raha so jitana B apnea passive stake here Jitrabi apnea coin stake here apko uska chadas percent as inflation Malaga at the end of a certain period of time depends from protocol to protocol kivo Kahoga period of time for some chains Apco reward Hari block kebab Miljat after balance had block kebab for some chains this happens after 32 blocks. For example ethereum for some chains it happens after two days, that is Solana validate Katan Bhad upkeep account balance increase however, what happens is there are a lot of things that need to be kept in check for blockchain to function. I wouldn't call it perfectly well, but at least on a certain extent on a satisfactable level though.
00:31:13.902 - 00:32:13.794, Speaker D: Unchizoko in check rakna incentives let's say key we want a network to be very well decentralized. So for that we want key a lot of different nodes are communicating among themselves and they are actively doing this. Validators offline so Iskaran for example, ask rewards Iskan uninterring validator Hamisha online right Iscom validator per performance so Agarapi validator performance Jada rewards similarly, if a network wants key unke pass Hamisha a certain threshold of amount staked. Rahe because the amount staked is key, how secure is your network? The more is the amount staked, the better for the network. So again, the total amount staked also affects the rewards. Similarly for the block proposal, as I said, you become a block proposal according to a schedule. So Agarapna block proposal transactions there certain chains give you the transaction fees that was earned there.
00:32:13.794 - 00:32:41.850, Speaker D: For other chains, there is also high MeV involved. For example, ethereum pay MeV is actually significant and it is significant on other chains. It is probably not as significant as Ethereum, but it is very significant. Abhiyapna lately Sunayoga there was a block that had 600 Ethereum in MeV. 600 ethereum is about $1.2 million. So that is a huge amount of reward for a single validator for proposing a single block.
00:32:41.850 - 00:32:47.822, Speaker D: Okay, I understand. Let's say Kihamariko stake consult assets okay.
00:32:47.876 - 00:32:48.480, Speaker B: But.
00:32:50.370 - 00:33:27.046, Speaker D: User so istaka user key there are different chains allow different ways of shaking your assets after list they create. These are the top ten largest chains. Joe proof of stake which lt may live here. So in Mesa, for example, ethereum taking it ethereum in order to earn rewards apco validator present in the rega. It will be about how do you run a validator node and that is what Nethermind does as well. So ethereum for example, 200 watts. You will need to run a validator for other chains.
00:33:27.046 - 00:34:06.040, Speaker D: It is not necessary validator run karna per day delegate means key let's say apkopatheki my friend is running a validator node. I trust him. Map delegate karo agarbote hair that is my friend's responsibility Agar Nayote I earn the reward or bomuthi the commission. This is how you can stake your assets as well. I hope this was at least a good introduction for you to understand what is proof of stake and agarnas. There is a lot of material as well on YouTube available and simply Google pay with us.
00:34:07.370 - 00:34:24.826, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the informative talk. Maxim Hamara viewers a question bitcoin may proof of work use kajara or ethereum may abhamlu proof of stake kara the mare viewer Kaye question Taki Kia zada safe proof of work Zada CFA proof.
00:34:24.858 - 00:36:01.030, Speaker D: Of stake the point is not basically I wouldn't say kika safer hair because it all depends on the algorithm, just say consensus reach Horahahe however agar hamdeka kika jada scalable for safety I would think key proof of stake is much more scalable. Why do I say so? Because Javane I would like to go back to my previous I would like to go back to my previous example of the race. So jab race may agar das bande Bhagrah and they are trying to achieve the same state to get the same result. Then there is no point of all of them doing the same thing, same work again and again. However, proof of stake may have to eliminate current the way that these nodes communicate and that is chain specific which basically does represent of how safe the chain is. Another thing that says kika jada safer hair is how can you attack the chain agarapka's proof of work chain a so in order to attack the chain apco mine karthi like block a mine right on proof of work so apco apnea chain pay jadam job chain k fogo jagarako chain up chain k though different woven asakti version pay in order to become to become to create a malicious version, you have to overpower the network. Just compose the 51% attack kiaco basically 51% of the computation J of the network.
00:36:01.030 - 00:36:24.370, Speaker D: So that is how you would attack a proof of work chain. However, proof of stake may the way you do it is you need a lot of stake. So right now on ethereum I'm not sure about the amount stake but it's definitely in billions of dollars. To agrapk attack kernel you need a very large amount of money which is difficult and kind of infeasible in user. So that is why I would say proof of stake is much more scalable.
00:36:26.870 - 00:36:54.170, Speaker A: Thank you for the answer.

01:23:32.410 - 01:23:33.186, Speaker E: Thank you harsh.
01:23:33.218 - 01:23:52.900, Speaker B: Can you just confirm kimria jiyam thank you as a screenshot abdikrian thank you.
01:23:54.390 - 01:24:51.546, Speaker E: So hi my name is Tanish kulam I'm a solidity engineer never mind I'm looking at basically mirror Goliaki automated market makers get a fundamental concept shaman could discuss current so basically a talk on loan automated market makers uniswap in sakanam sunai or confused decentralized finance space may automated market so in case just jolo padmas questions on his chat, telegram or twitter donokalinka you can DM me discuss.
01:24:51.648 - 01:24:56.598, Speaker B: The talk about so automated market makers.
01:24:56.614 - 01:25:04.870, Speaker E: Kibarima bhatkan is a subsequent fundamental Maratha what's the anatomy of a simple swap?
01:25:05.030 - 01:25:07.774, Speaker B: So xwap kushni x just can you.
01:25:07.812 - 01:25:11.166, Speaker E: Convert x of amount convert x of.
01:25:11.188 - 01:25:13.662, Speaker B: A into Y of something h is.
01:25:13.716 - 01:25:47.046, Speaker E: X is a hamaripaska x amount they're both confusing it but isco gold or rupees suppose eight gram gold up capacity so whose gold key value cover Rs500 right 1 gram of gold is worth Rs500 so this is the same thing. You can do this with anything. You can do it with gold and ethereum you can do it with bottles of water and rupees. You can do it with anything. And that is just what a swap is. A simple swap. Key anatomy it's me or a mad.
01:25:47.078 - 01:25:47.850, Speaker B: Kring.
01:25:49.950 - 01:26:16.466, Speaker E: Which is that jab zada buyers the price increase on ajio because agar sublog or which is key supply coming of course or agar sellers are there or low karina Tosca price decrease on AJ. These are two simple things that I think should be obvious, but if they're not, we can discuss them in detail.
01:26:16.568 - 01:26:21.270, Speaker B: Baki if you have any questions, chat magic cool.
01:26:21.340 - 01:26:29.270, Speaker E: So yeah or iskai price car fundamental concept eight gram gold pans rupee. So 500 by one is the price.
01:26:29.420 - 01:26:43.306, Speaker B: Price is 500 cool. So how do I okay. Should not amateur cool.
01:26:43.408 - 01:26:46.666, Speaker E: So isma logone which basic assumptions we.
01:26:46.688 - 01:26:51.590, Speaker B: Got is model man which is some.
01:26:51.680 - 01:27:06.942, Speaker E: The assumption that we made is eight gram gold hair was kobe simple assumption important at each level which says dono's.
01:27:07.006 - 01:27:09.938, Speaker B: Market may same time pair or is.
01:27:10.024 - 01:27:28.726, Speaker E: Problem both buddy actually may don't know market same time you guys cannot work together. Subtle point. Price of gold determined Kasakti Agarma Gold.
01:27:28.758 - 01:27:29.450, Speaker B: Seller.
01:27:36.190 - 01:29:03.402, Speaker E: To KSE market price Hamdu Milky decide Kasakta puri market Jibbana Yebi problem solve kata so Yamari model when yabamo Quick swap Samajagi swap Kyota or amaya Jagyaki Hamlogari assumptions make careers model to simplify abam making you an assumptions Cube automated market maker exchange infrastructure stakeholders discussion with conkon stakeholder subsequent I call him the naive user naive user Kakamatlabaki naive user says swap Kana future price of the asset Kikoi real information but my gold minor new Merko yani Pata Knowledge Niyaki market research career Dusra is the clever arbitrage. He is informed about the future price of an profit ojaga asset key future.
01:29:03.456 - 01:29:06.730, Speaker B: Price Kikui knowledge arbitrage.
01:29:08.670 - 01:29:24.730, Speaker E: Market maker gives us thin basic qualities. This is a very big statement. I'm going to discuss karanga aro Hamisha sell kariga so the goal is uski goal is Jobuski asset.
01:29:26.950 - 01:29:27.538, Speaker B: And then the.
01:29:27.544 - 01:29:56.230, Speaker E: Final thing is the battleground which is the exchange decentralized exchanges. So that is the battleground or skin that bought components other as your tokens analysis Katan to Kafibar Airdrops Airdrops emissions governance Kisi Turkey incentives although I'm Karni bank already five minutes into the talk so much market makers would discuss kappa.
01:29:56.310 - 01:30:01.610, Speaker B: Market makers entity could torah will buy and sell anything this is pretty self.
01:30:01.680 - 01:30:10.586, Speaker E: Explanatory will buy and sell anything all of the time like of course this has terms and conditions applied but they're.
01:30:10.618 - 01:30:13.486, Speaker B: Always in the market but the one.
01:30:13.508 - 01:30:44.114, Speaker E: Thing is that they will buy and sell at their own price so basically vogagarangi kuki just because my market may hamisha or metumarika problem solved karam double coincidence of bondsi problem solved karangi Agaradmi market mara metabus even though Joe gold buyer market marriage right so there's a time gap but may risk like it profit banta profit so may swap convenience.
01:30:44.162 - 01:30:48.866, Speaker B: Provide katakumko or math arbitrage care yellow.
01:30:48.898 - 01:31:07.078, Speaker E: Market makers opposite they are in and out of the market in the shortest time possible very quickly or volokoka asaniki they're not doing you some service they want to make a quick and guaranteed profit to Jesse Gold pantrupe or NSCP gold sale pantrope NSCP instant profit malaya.
01:31:07.114 - 01:31:09.906, Speaker B: Or dono prices equilibrium so they want.
01:31:09.928 - 01:33:36.734, Speaker E: To buy cheap and sell for more yato sabi ghanajada and they act as equilibrium forces amongst all of the exchanges so kahipeb prices equal garna you look at but it's come on the yanyagi hamisha ecosystem ecosystem Hamiya discuss kasak in some future talk key when is arbitraging good? So they buy an asset on an exchange where it is cheap and they drive up the market price and they sell it where it is high and they drive down the market price so you reach equilibrium so abjali some concrete models so traditional finance may you do problems I'm not going to discuss kariki stakeholder traditional finance order book band is price pick the Mount Silkanachata is price pick and stuff buyers or sellers milk yesra buyers sellership 37.38 or 37.37 maybe is a good price jump and bhat kasakte or for yahasse selling perfect buyer or seller directly milatha market maker keep both but it's both problematically expensive so thora jolo computer science kitrav inclined bigo of n problem bigo of NTB Zada basically her order killer to make extra computation kanyebati or uniswap? Uniswap v two you bought popular equation x into y is equal to k sub logana the Qv but it's equation kp basic equation or pricing suppose gold kamarpas pants gold pants for xogia hazar amount hazar bioga so K oga 500 to 1000 subsequently discuss karthiki pricing may k actually may matter.
01:33:36.772 - 01:33:39.054, Speaker B: Kata pricing mikay actually matter.
01:33:39.092 - 01:34:14.782, Speaker E: Nikata discuss Karthiki Price Nikalteka jalogo to as a math samajata price is basically the tangent of this point. Price is y by x. Yahoo discuss tso golder dy by Dx axis Joe todalog mathematically implied. Suppose a two comma, one here. So two comma, one ka price two oga one 0.5 depending on which direction you're looking at. So the tangent of this curve represents the price.
01:34:14.836 - 01:34:18.366, Speaker B: Yamloni discuss kalia is hamloga x y.
01:34:18.388 - 01:34:47.586, Speaker E: Into k sluic hyperbola equation infinity but it will never go to exactly zero price exponentially zero new because I'm kabini chadagi exchange megasara price exponentially infinitely increase.
01:34:47.618 - 01:34:48.470, Speaker B: Katara.
01:34:50.270 - 01:35:44.460, Speaker E: Basically batada hamarijo pot of gold liquidity kitana kitna asset hair maripas bashma karim but uskaqua relation near price. So let's move on to some examples, right? So a x plus y is equal to k equation. Why does this equation not work like a x into y is equal to k equation. Mesa kas plus y is equal to k. And interesting cheese, they cook it constant or hamipataki slope is equal to price, right? Orange stable coin manara USD septic so merko but in general meghayana like hamari fundamental assumption the model.
01:35:48.270 - 01:35:50.698, Speaker B: In ekas so.
01:35:50.864 - 01:36:37.194, Speaker E: I think I'm running out of time but my acre interesting cheese, random curves banatha but they take taboo kam karang. So let's look at the x squared plus y square is equal to k curve x squared plus y square is equal to k is basically the equation of a circle. Isma oga japtum is point per pod jogi one value point per pound jogi yahape price amisha zero rega because yahpe price zero regular infinity incentive yahape sapku bba price slowly move kariga but when you reach the end asset katam ojaga and you don't have any joe price ever infinity ojaga. So your model edges but as a botsari or equation that you don't create.
01:36:37.232 - 01:36:41.066, Speaker B: Karakto I think I'll stop at this.
01:36:41.088 - 01:36:59.938, Speaker E: Point with kolasa advanced concept, but basically market makers or liquidity providers. But we can discuss that in some further talk.
01:37:00.024 - 01:37:03.220, Speaker B: So I will stop here for any questions at this point.
01:37:04.710 - 01:37:36.926, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Tanish we are short of time so pamloy but talk sagi barangay or sari questions. Come look end me raking it.

01:49:29.656 - 01:49:30.820, Speaker B: Because tools.
01:49:38.040 - 01:49:48.964, Speaker H: Jesse Ganese Nebata or scalability issue Jesse Hersh Nebata research Ethereum transaction.
01:49:49.012 - 01:49:50.200, Speaker B: Slow Jata.
01:49:52.300 - 01:50:04.856, Speaker H: Ethereum as a layer ethereum layer 1 may Kutch node operator hotel or Kutch block producer minor voltage or layer one blockchain itself Joe Ethereum blockchain.
01:50:04.888 - 01:50:09.464, Speaker B: Hotel Japasari transaction data or mechanism Hota.
01:50:09.512 - 01:50:21.600, Speaker H: Consensus mechanism for the network like Kia rule like asset transaction accept hunger Ethereum blockchain the Casa transaction add karpanga to Ethereum.
01:50:25.860 - 01:50:29.472, Speaker B: Smart contract run karp but problem.
01:50:29.606 - 01:51:30.968, Speaker H: Is scaling q kernel Jesse hasn't used a log jada use current smart contract decentralized banangay or EVM Jada use current published current kawaki logo transaction execute clinically both Sarah demand oJ so transaction demand Kafijada Ojagikaran consensus mechanism achieve karna community of bowjada long approval bowjada low particular transaction k or number of transactions which are the only throughput network as low jaga scaling separately upon team teaches decentralization or particular blockchain scalability decentralization of security hotika basically koI decentralized network achieve kanachata first one is scalability, second is decentralization and third is security or if you.
01:51:30.974 - 01:51:34.824, Speaker B: Know apasm interconnected decentralization klee how many.
01:51:34.862 - 01:52:32.796, Speaker H: Permission different low code in out there or security justice consensus mechanism Kikoi attack now by pure network pay to say bhajanikili Jada node song network may to system Jada secure oga I mean community Jada secure Oga blockchain Pecoi attack neopaga but ecosystem solutions sharding side chains or state channels Joki scaling Kijuku dictate solution proposed karthi or both Sarah organization or companies in Pekam Kara Jesse mass admission Ethereum price kicker and scaling critical or ethereum already maximum transaction per day 1.
01:52:32.818 - 01:52:36.270, Speaker B: Million transaction per day so.
01:52:43.620 - 01:52:53.830, Speaker H: Gas price gas price Q Jada oga kiki number of transactions Jada transaction proposed current minus go but miners white transaction choose current.
01:52:56.200 - 01:52:57.190, Speaker B: Such that.
01:53:01.000 - 01:53:14.888, Speaker H: Price for a particular transaction network key to asking price OG for a particular transaction it would be higher, right? So scaly solution jokey particularly on layer.
01:53:14.904 - 01:53:18.940, Speaker B: Two bolte and layer two basically involves.
01:53:19.440 - 01:53:21.768, Speaker H: All the new technologies like sarding role.
01:53:21.784 - 01:53:28.460, Speaker B: Of subscribe chain or in Sabukumalagam layer two bolt or layer two benefit.
01:53:31.760 - 01:53:37.520, Speaker H: Maintaining the security QK layer one pay ankar is the current layer one Kisari security.
01:53:37.590 - 01:53:41.712, Speaker B: Value benefits layer two kumiljati or QK.
01:53:41.776 - 01:53:57.576, Speaker H: Layer two Ethereum go scale garnet benefits mild decentralized app Banashakto multiple higher frequency transition Chalyota execute curse using layer two.
01:53:57.598 - 01:54:02.424, Speaker B: Tools layer two klea basically layer two.
01:54:02.462 - 01:54:16.750, Speaker H: Both side tools but especially my bhatkarung tools Canam roll ups roll upskarte both side transaction or say layer one.
01:54:19.220 - 01:54:19.756, Speaker B: Ethereum.
01:54:19.788 - 01:55:03.884, Speaker H: Blockchain pay will publish transaction publisher Ethereum blockchain transaction killer fees pay but bundle up current publish current Ethereum blockchain cost hoagie US transaction Kivo puri divide transaction or Abika roll ups Abitak Banjuka particularly saw transaction gas fee 100 x kamojati or as of now roll ups is.
01:55:03.922 - 01:55:07.404, Speaker B: The most preferred solution for scaling as.
01:55:07.442 - 01:55:24.020, Speaker H: Of now but still also developed on the vitral research. But let's keep that thing aside. So roll ups basically do type kyota first is optimistic roll up second 10.
01:55:24.090 - 01:55:27.380, Speaker B: Knowledge optimistic roll up vote.
01:55:30.200 - 01:55:31.332, Speaker A: Just expect.
01:55:31.386 - 01:55:55.196, Speaker H: Karthiki roll up sotage bundle of Kia or publish khadiya adversary logiku transaction go tamper karakte Gala database or blockchain go overall blockchain optimistic development data particularly user or client behavior layer one go or.
01:55:55.218 - 01:55:59.688, Speaker B: Publish karna jayaga or uscalia fraud proof.
01:55:59.704 - 01:56:10.900, Speaker H: Technology use karthi joki just an simulation of them Sarilson particularly with the Joe Ethereum blockchain.
01:56:12.920 - 01:56:19.648, Speaker B: Proposed karai expected ayakiniki fraud.
01:56:19.664 - 01:56:31.590, Speaker H: Proof mechanism like in zero knowledge roll ups may proof that.
01:57:08.250 - 01:57:19.654, Speaker B: Blockchain or usma a particular book ignored ethereum blockchain or us book key IG basic transaction or.
01:57:19.692 - 01:57:22.986, Speaker H: Minor kia kartai bookmay it pays pay.
01:57:23.008 - 01:57:27.242, Speaker B: Which likta or bookmay adgar data so.
01:57:27.376 - 01:57:30.422, Speaker H: Mine basically pays quick bookmay ad kartha.
01:57:30.486 - 01:57:33.226, Speaker B: Through binding process let's say transition to.
01:57:33.248 - 01:58:21.690, Speaker H: Joby fees binding process may joby materials user Joby label normal eleven ethereum blockchain transaction quick book may add garth or book liability may add quick bookmay add karnaki through cost of what roll ups are a paysat ung summary create karthi or usko Ik page or phil finally bookmay adgara joki both sarah pages summary likrakata or is the cost is the reduce summary or uscalajo gluca cost lega.
01:58:22.190 - 01:58:25.338, Speaker B: Just ikibar laga these cases are roll.
01:58:25.354 - 01:59:21.882, Speaker H: Ups let's say 100 pages grow some reads create curry or bookmark so stagnant avivatayaki genome joki cairo based hair sorry programming language Cairo use karthe or stack as a proof for data validation. The data validation is karthi or a start with industry use stacknet secure profitable stocknet contracts use kartha joki Cairo mini kawata or Cairo Turing complete signing language or Cairo language cover up sorry proof generate proof karthi or is struck proof basis pay verify kasaki transactions proposed karai.
01:59:21.946 - 01:59:22.960, Speaker B: Those are correct.
01:59:25.170 - 01:59:39.678, Speaker H: Aphrisi cairo or solidity May 30 word conversion curve so cairo basically both a primitive type language joki both becomes typesco support kartha unlike solidity strongly typed in it has different types.
01:59:39.694 - 01:59:43.174, Speaker B: Like un eight un to 56 sorry.
01:59:43.292 - 02:00:50.550, Speaker H: And addresses but if target language types felt felt represent karnagota or ismay kyro mejo memory othio immutable ot like egg variable egg value shine gargoyle these are the difficulties that beginner faces when he writes contract in a Cairo right ethereum sorry solidity may smart contraction about the sun developer initially but agarwo expert but initially musky logi the main aim main aim of this tool is just write your solidity course and deploy to the stagnate stagnate Gk role of a joke.
02:00:50.630 - 02:00:57.310, Speaker B: Language use kata as writing proofs proposing proofs to the layer blockchain.
02:00:59.890 - 02:01:52.058, Speaker H: So amid discussion rule follow garth instruction type checker Edgar features or add Karthi add Karthi Jesse upna custom features like yabika warp use karthi kcheck function to write cryptographic kcheck to 56 function or memory systems Wesley use Kartha Jessica solidity but isku customs implementation or Cairo contracts Kaliaju inputs and output encoding or decoding theory city print hotier to transpire format curtains that's.
02:01:52.074 - 02:01:55.710, Speaker B: That k compatible kaido k format basically.
02:01:55.780 - 02:02:06.206, Speaker H: Abido peleki let's say code block here as an input lega or yay output.
02:02:06.238 - 02:02:07.090, Speaker B: Lega.
02:02:09.430 - 02:02:27.930, Speaker H: Coder or ye solidity you can compare u intel strongly type with a solid failed convert hoga or yape type checker edgar solidity may agar koi value sorry koi variable type over u and eight value maximum 255 Osakti.
02:02:30.030 - 02:02:31.450, Speaker B: Agar kovi.
02:02:32.030 - 02:02:56.146, Speaker H: Value over xraski value 255 say less than function k block maker thing or manu bhatkara instruction could simplify karthi Manoki line number four make complicated expression where two functions are calling right f call karthik gk function code Gp internally call.
02:02:56.168 - 02:03:01.218, Speaker B: Karthiko now the complex situation breakdown ojaga.
02:03:01.234 - 02:03:10.114, Speaker H: Do partner line number six line number seven x may pan using the previous.
02:03:10.162 - 02:03:11.080, Speaker B: Value y.
02:03:13.470 - 02:04:01.110, Speaker H: Or just a manicure memory system because solidity gave us to mutable memory system like in output produce Kataji memory system Mutable Nayota simulation memory system is shamed up near Cairo meota open use karthi pointers pointers get through open value change Karthik particular location Yogi Cairo allow kartha possible hope RT memory system simulate Hoja donume or work capacity storage system Cairo language complex.
02:04:03.070 - 02:04:03.866, Speaker B: As opposed to.
02:04:03.888 - 02:04:39.510, Speaker H: In solidity solidity may just say complex mapping arrays but chiroma feature but yay structure upon storage system Mutable banasakte or escape through possible hopataiki Johij solidity may hope at you cairo maybe Jose or correctness up and check Karthi Jovi input output solidity contract code let's say Koi solidity may contract.
02:04:43.610 - 02:04:47.618, Speaker B: Output or output expected.
02:04:47.634 - 02:06:01.230, Speaker H: Results in mascara verify Garthi Kobe solidity contract Kajo output so the code Joe open likam's contract same tool Kazi correctness but we input change current feed current then we check current basically toolko use karthi tool score Banaya Joki first Unistag Unistag repository Joki Amne Transpile Kara Unishop V Three protocol Go Joki palace already team a Puri repository transpile Karai puri repository Chiro no orbiko stool such as a horror Cairo contract test cursecto or.
02:06:01.300 - 02:06:04.686, Speaker B: A repository of whopping contracts where we.
02:06:04.708 - 02:06:08.426, Speaker H: Have put joki bolts are examples solidity.
